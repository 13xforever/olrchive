0	20880	Today, March 15, 2009, GamePro goes game publisher, Call of Duty passes a landmark for online
20880	29760	play, and which company is giving away a free game this week?
29760	35960	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35960	41200	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
41200	42200	lifestyle.
42200	45920	And we tape live every Sunday night on allgames.com.
45920	50680	That's www.allgames.com, All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show about
50680	55680	six o'clock Pacific Standard Time on the West Coast, nine o'clock Eastern for the East Coast.
55680	58640	My name is Robert, I'm just joining you here every week.
58640	62080	Joining us also every week, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
62080	63080	How's it going?
63080	64080	I'm good.
64080	65080	How are you, Tech Master Loki?
65080	66080	Doing good.
66080	67480	All right, excellent.
67480	72560	And also joining us tonight, running fresh in from inside the house, live radio.
72560	76040	Say hello to the one and only, Jamie Summers, how you doing?
76040	78520	I had beer last night and I feel good.
78520	79520	Did you?
79520	80520	Congratulations.
80520	81520	Much beer was had.
81520	82520	But you always drink responsibly, correct?
82520	85600	Yep, that's why I have someone else be responsible for me.
85600	86600	All right, excellent.
86600	91320	All right, and of course, not only do we tape live on All Games Radio, but you can also
91320	93240	watch our video feed on Justin TV.
93240	96560	Just before the show went live tonight, we were taking a peek at Madworld on the Nintendo
96560	100240	Wii, which I guess has quickly become one of Loki's favorite games?
100240	101240	Yes.
101240	103720	And what is it about Madworld that you're loving?
103720	104720	Everything.
104720	106520	You brutally murder people.
106520	112040	Yeah, I saw you throw the guy into the air jet or something like that, just blood everywhere.
112040	114440	Describe this game a little bit for those that have no idea what this game is or the
114440	118320	fact that a game like this exists on the Nintendo Wii of all things, try to describe this game
118320	119320	real quick.
119320	122800	This game is sort of like, um, a little bit like The Running Man.
122800	128800	Basically, you are... the terrorists have taken over this one city and they've kind
128800	132840	of created this giant murder game show out of it.
132840	137120	And you're this guy, Jack, who decides to go ahead and enter this.
137120	142040	And basically all the contestants have a poison that's in them and they have to win the competition
142040	143700	to get the antidote.
143700	148520	So that's what he's doing is trying to kill everybody to get to rank number one.
148520	151880	Was this a Stephen King novel?
151880	152880	No.
152880	155200	Except they were running.
155200	156920	That was the Long Walk, Rob.
156920	157920	Similar.
157920	158920	Similarities, though.
158920	163560	But basically, the whole game looks like it's a black and white comic book with lots of
163560	166360	splashes of red when you brutally murder people.
166360	171200	And I mean, everything from snapping people in half at their spine to cutting them in
171200	176760	half with a chainsaw in multiple ways, to throwing them against a spike wall, to setting
176760	180440	them on fire, stabbing them with, you know, street signs.
180440	182160	There's so many different ways to kill people.
182160	184480	It's like, yeah, the graphics are like that old joke.
184480	186600	You know the old joke, what's black and white and red all over?
186600	189960	But, you know, it's like the newspaper is like the riddle or if you're a smart ass,
189960	192320	it's a zebra that just got shot.
192320	195000	But now you could say what's black and white and red all over.
195000	198560	Mad World is really what the graphics look like.
198560	201200	You are black and white and occasionally red.
201200	202200	It's very red.
202200	205560	As it is, you know, the game would be awesome just with that.
205560	208760	But oh no, Sega does not just stop there.
208760	211280	They decide that we need sports commentators as well.
211280	212280	And who'd they get?
212280	214400	Greg Proops and John DiMaggio.
214400	218640	John DiMaggio you might remember as the voice of Bender and Greg Proops from Whose Line.
218640	221560	They should have gotten Madden.
221560	222560	John Madden?
222560	225240	John, or at least Frank Caliendo.
225240	227920	You gotta, that would be awesome.
227920	229760	You gotta save something for the sequel though.
229760	231760	And I can guarantee there will be a sequel.
231760	235460	And honestly, Greg Proops is amazing and, you know, he was the announcer in Star Wars
235460	237800	Phantom Menace during the podrace, right?
237800	238800	I think so.
238800	241520	Anyhow, enough fanboy over Mad World.
241520	243680	I'm sure Loki will talk about this a little more in just a minute.
243680	246800	But first, we're gonna get to how was your gaming week and we do always start it off
246800	247800	ladies first.
247800	249000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
249000	250960	Um, I played some Ragnarok.
250960	251960	That's really about it.
251960	256480	We've actually been having a different sort of gaming experience in my house, which is
256480	259120	called Cleaning Out the Vault.
259120	265360	I found so much E3 swag and no one, no one wants any of it, guys, trust me, it's shit.
265360	270640	Um, but we've been piling up our systems and realized that we have four Saturns, two Coleco
270640	271640	Visions.
271640	274240	Dude, I want a Saturn.
274240	275240	Talk to my husband.
275240	276240	I have two Saturns.
276240	277240	No, I don't, I don't.
277240	278240	I don't know why I would.
278240	279240	I have two Saturns I don't play.
279240	280240	What would I play on the Saturn, seriously?
280240	284000	But we're debating taking one of our systems and doing a giveaway with it and having, you
284000	288240	know, us autograph it or something, you know, maybe who wants a Coleco Vision?
288240	289240	Hey.
289240	290240	Uh, okay.
290240	291920	Good luck getting that shit to work.
291920	292920	It works just fine.
292920	293920	Does it really?
293920	294920	Coleco Visions are awesome.
294920	296560	Can you even hook those up to newer TVs?
296560	302720	We actually would be, yes, you can do, they have the, um, RCA or not RCA, the, uh, RF.
302720	308100	Yeah, they have an RF, but, um, but we also have, um, uh, drive two driving wheels.
308100	309920	So we'd have a spare driving wheel.
309920	311720	One of ours is Canadian.
311720	318200	Um, we have my Super Nintendo, which was the very first system I bought with my own money.
318200	319200	That was cool.
319200	323040	And the person who owned it before me smoked because it's all yellow.
323040	330880	Um, so yeah, we've got piles of stuff just hanging around and so, hey.
330880	333920	All right, maybe a giveaway, maybe.
333920	341060	Maybe, but we, we did also, um, we have a stack of old, um, strategy guides.
341060	342760	A number of them from the eighties.
342760	345700	Hey, some of that stuff goes for money on eBay.
345700	349280	We have how to win at Castlevania.
349280	350280	That's funny.
350280	351280	Nice.
351280	355440	You win at Castlevania, buy a Dracula, whoo, like in a car.
355440	359600	Uh, I'm going to also introduce the chat room right now at this time, chat.orangelandraday.com
359600	363700	always when we're taping live on Sunday nights, you know, the listener experience and getting
363700	366040	to interact with the show is really what makes this show unique.
366040	371320	Um, just kind of reading some comments here from the chat room, um, Tigerclaw says Greg
371320	372920	Proops is awesome.
372920	378280	Black Wolf points out John DiMaggio is also the voice of Marcus Fenix and he should have
378280	383000	done it, and I'm sorry, Quiltipo says John DiMaggio should have done it in his Waka voice.
383000	386040	Maybe, I don't know about that.
386040	389920	Waka kind of got on my, oh, Waka kind of got on my nerves by the end of Final Fantasy X,
389920	391360	but maybe that's just me.
391360	393920	Uh, let's see, other thoughts on gaming week.
393920	395560	Loki, how was your gaming week?
395560	401760	My gaming week was good, I, um, played a few things actually this week, um, starting off
401760	407880	with an, I don't know why I decided to try this, Pagle DS.
407880	413080	Why have I, you know, it's sad that I found Pagle now, because it is quite addicting.
413080	416320	Um, Yeah, wait, I don't know why you're knocking it, isn't it?
416320	417320	Isn't this a good thing?
417320	421000	I'm not knocking it, I'm saying, ah, Pagle, there's something else to be addicted to,
421000	422000	okay.
422000	423000	Oh, okay, I gotcha.
423000	427800	It was kind of fun, um, so, that's pretty cool, and, um, have you checked out the one
427800	428800	on Xbox yet?
428800	429800	No.
429800	432440	Okay, because I was going to ask you, how is it different on the DS, well, have you
432440	433840	played any other version of Pagle?
433840	434840	No.
434840	435840	Okay, then never mind, you can't answer my question.
435840	439480	I was going to ask, is it, how is it different on the DS, but I guess you can't answer that.
439480	443500	It's not really that different, I don't think, from anything else, it's, I mean, basically,
443500	447880	you control it with the stylus to aim, and then when you hold the stylus in one spot,
447880	450080	it'll zoom in, and then you can fine aim with that.
450080	451080	Oh, that's pretty cool.
451080	454880	And then, um, you know, you stop, button, and it'll shoot, and that's it.
454880	455880	Um.
455880	459440	SSJ100Matt asks the wife test question, asking would Nellie play Pagle?
459440	462920	Maybe, I haven't shown it to her yet.
462920	464920	You've got cookies!
464920	465920	Um.
465920	471880	For those that are randomly yelling out, my roommate just popped in the studio here, um,
471880	476240	and it has a really big smirk on his face, I'm trying to figure out, oh boy, okay, John
476240	477960	wants to speak on the show.
477960	481440	Did we give you a nickname on this show, John?
481440	482440	My roommate?
482440	485280	My secret nickname is either Roommate or John.
485280	488480	Okay, your secret nickname is Roommate or John, we gotta get you a mic here.
488480	489480	Alright.
489480	490760	Your superhero name would be the roomie.
490760	496480	I'm gonna make this short, um, I don't usually play tons and tons of video games, but iPhone
496480	501960	game app called Arveil, completely amazing, old school Final Fantasy style game, haven't
501960	506520	been able to stop playing it for like three days, and it's fantastic, and I actually paid
506520	510240	for the paid version, which is unspeakable and unheard of.
510240	511240	So that's my little plug.
511240	514160	Wait, tell us a little, how'd you find this game?
514160	516640	Tell us a little more about how it plays, because this is unheard of that you actually
516640	520800	want to participate in the show, and about video games, and not making fun of me, so
520800	524600	I'm, I definitely want to know a little bit more about how you found this and how it plays
524600	528320	and all that, like, you know, how do you control it on an iPhone?
528320	532880	It's pretty simple, there's a little action button for most things, and there's a little
532880	540200	control pad, so it's, you know, left, right, up, down, diagonals, um, found it going through
540200	546920	strategy games that were free on the iPhone, and then liked it so much I bought the paid
546920	547920	version.
547920	554080	It plays like an old school Final Fantasy, like, maybe Final Fantasy 5 or so, I think,
554080	555080	and...
555080	559240	Wait, am I filling in for Jamie?
559240	564480	Am I supposed to, like, grow tits tonight, or be extra sassy?
564480	567920	She's just going to the loo, I think.
567920	571240	She's going to the soda, which is kind of like the loo?
571240	573480	Maybe we should keep the soda in the bathroom.
573480	577520	Okay, um, what else was I going to ask, though?
577520	580520	Is this game available anywhere else that you know of, or, because some folks in our
580520	584040	chat room are saying, I don't have an iPhone, so are they just screwed?
584040	589040	Then I would say that their life is incomplete and they need to go buy an iPhone.
589040	590040	These are obvious things.
590040	592720	I don't know why I'm having to tell your listeners this.
592720	594520	Apple thanks you for the free plug.
594520	595520	All right.
595520	597800	All right, well, thank you, John, for your contributions.
597800	599560	Wait, you forgot to wave to Justin.TV.
599560	600560	They're very mad.
600560	605160	They had to look at your butt the whole time you were talking, and now they want some recognition.
605160	606160	All right.
606160	607960	Anyhow, uh, Loki.
607960	608960	I'm so sorry about that.
608960	612040	Anyways, that's okay, that's okay.
612040	618240	Other than Pagel DS, I also played Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, which is interesting.
618240	622480	It's definitely a different take on Grand Theft Auto, well, not that different, I mean,
622480	629360	it's very similar to 1 and 2, but having come off of 4 and Lost and Damned, it is kind of
629360	636800	hard to go back to the 2D stuff, or top-down Grand Theft Auto games, but it's okay.
636800	643160	Very similar to the older games, they did add some neat touch screen stuff into it as
643160	645400	well.
645400	648960	Haven't played a whole lot of it yet, so I can't give a full impression on it yet, but
648960	651000	it's okay so far.
651000	656560	Storyline's kind of, eh, but we'll see, I mean, it might get better, but right now it's
656560	659200	kind of cheesy.
659200	665200	And then, other than DS stuff, I have also played, of course, more Lost and Damned, still
665200	667860	lots of multiplayer in that.
667860	671880	Playing around with the glitch of the game, there's a spot where pedestrians spawn in
671880	674200	the middle of the air and fall from the sky.
674200	676640	Sounds kind of fun.
676640	682720	And then, I played a little bit of PS3 today, I went ahead and finally got around to playing
682720	687640	the little big planet Contra levels, so that was kind of fun.
687640	693000	And I also went and played Nobby, Nobby Boy for a few, I would say, yeah, a few seconds
693000	699880	until Nelly's like, that bass sound when you're stretching is really fucking annoying, so
699880	704360	I had to turn it off, so I stopped playing that.
704360	706600	Yeah, pretty much.
706600	707600	She cracked the whip, you had to stop playing.
707600	712640	And then, of course, you know, Mad World, you know, that game's awesome in all sorts
712640	716440	of ways, and unfortunately I haven't really made it past the first level, because I haven't
716440	720920	gotten a chance to actually sit down and play it for a long enough time, so.
720920	724600	The first level's really cool, though, so I can't wait.
724600	725920	Alright.
725920	731400	Well, my gaming week was actually pretty busy, considering I was out of town for like three
731400	734680	days, I didn't think I'd have a very busy gaming week, the only thing I really played
734680	736840	on the plane was Metroid Zero.
736840	741000	Yes, I went back, and it's my second favorite Metroid game, next to Super Metroid, I went
741000	745560	back and played on my DS, the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot, Metroid Zero, because that
745560	749160	game is pretty fantastic, especially because I'm such a fan of Super Metroid, of course
749160	753320	I'm going to like Metroid Zero, it's practically the same thing, but, you know, with different
753320	754440	levels and a different layout.
754440	758480	So if, you know, you need an oldie but goodie to check out, because this game's probably
758480	762240	about five years old now, I think it's from 04, check out Metroid Zero, it was one of
762240	766880	the last Advance games, I think, before they started switching over to DS stuff.
766880	773620	Otherwise, as far as other stuff goes, I actually took a trip last night with Rice Princess,
773620	777160	we went out to Roseville Golf Land, which is the local arcade, and we've given it a
777160	781480	lot of crap on this show, because Roseville Golf Land is the place where games go to die.
781480	784040	That's what we've always talked about here on the show, because you go there and, you
784040	787160	know, you just have to imagine, for those, you know, I know not everybody lives where
787160	792280	we live and knows this place, but it's a giant castle with a big golf course and a big water
792280	796880	park that they're known for, but it's just like they let little kids just run the frickin'
796880	800560	place because of it, and, of course, they don't know how to treat machines, parents
800560	803040	don't know how to police their children in a place like that, so the machines-
803040	804240	And they change their diapers on the machines.
804240	807760	Are always, yeah, oh god, and if you think she's lying, that's a completely true story,
807760	811960	that a diaper was once changed on a keyboard mania machine, but regardless, the machines
811960	816280	run down, broken, bleh, but we heard they got a BeatMania 2DX machine, so we had to
816280	818540	go check it out, and you know what?
818540	824260	We went, and I hadn't been in like a year, 18 months or so, and color me shocked, but
824260	826440	the place looked really nice.
826440	830600	Like they remodeled or something, they did some repainting in there, I didn't find a
830600	834440	machine that was broken, everything looked to be in a good state, I mean, granted, I
834440	839260	saw a Supernova 2, the monitor was a little junky, but honestly, considering all the parts
839260	844920	worked, the Max2 pads worked great, 2DX was in awesome condition, they've come a long
844920	845920	way.
845920	848640	I don't know if they're under new management or what the hell's going on over there, but
848640	851200	we have to admit when things change for the better, and I think that-
851200	854880	It's winter, that's why, no money for the water park.
854880	859320	Maybe, I don't know, but I've been there in winter before and been extremely disappointed,
859320	863360	so I don't know what's going on, but it's working, whatever they're doing, so props
863360	867560	to those guys, and sorry for giving you so much crap, but I guess it worked, because
867560	872480	the place was in a good state, so I played BeatMania 2DX Distorted, which I played before
872480	876880	because I had it at E3 a few years ago, but I haven't really touched BeatMania 2DX in
876880	883160	a long time, like it's been a long, long time, probably since this show took a more general
883160	888080	gaming approach as opposed to just music video games that we used to do, but I missed it,
888080	889080	it was fun.
889080	894820	Granted, I found myself playing all old songs, but yeah, I definitely want to go back and
894820	895820	play some more.
895820	900000	I had a really good time playing BeatMania 2DX, although I still think the newer songs
900000	904440	are not nearly as good as the older songs, I'm sorry to say.
904440	908200	Questions from chat, Floatwalk wants to know, does R. Vigal still have Disney's Rave?
908200	912120	Yes they do, I didn't play it though, but they do have Disney's Rave, and Rice Princess
912120	918000	is actually in chat right now saying 2DX was in excellent shape and loud, so yeah, the
918000	920800	machine was nice and loud, because you could turn the effectors on and all that.
920800	922840	So tell them about, was it Guitar Hero Arcade?
922840	927560	Yes, they had Guitar Hero Arcade which I played, I only played it once, so I can't really give
927560	931600	a full review on it, I can just tell you I got pissed off, because Roseville Golf Land
931600	935640	also switched to cards, they don't use tokens anymore, but cards, and when I was swiping
935640	938960	the card through and everything, I somehow hit the button an extra time to start the
938960	943000	game and I accidentally got on easy mode, and you can't switch it once you're on easy
943000	944000	mode.
944000	950160	But to me, honestly, it just looked like the freaking home game, except a smaller song
950160	955040	list, and it was just basically Guitar Hero 3 with a slightly smaller song list, and prettier
955040	959760	because there's lights on the machine and it spins around and the TV they use is very
959760	964820	very crisp, it's a very sharp image, but I don't know, would you want to pay a dollar
964820	968200	a game for something you can get at home?
968200	971480	But I understand there is an audience for this thing, and it's kind of cool to go out
971480	975220	and play with your friends and all that stuff, so I can see where this machine might do decent,
975220	983280	but if you have Guitar Hero at home, I don't see the point in this game, honestly.
983280	988200	Let's see, what else did I do in my gaming week this week?
988200	992720	I played the demo of The Last Remnant on the PC, and I was a little disappointed at how
992720	997320	choppy it was, and I just bought this PC back in August, so I know it's not like old parts
997320	1000800	or anything, but I was a little disappointed at how choppy it was, but the game itself
1000800	1004720	seemed kind of fun, so I might try to check it out on Xbox 360, although the PC wasn't
1004720	1007120	supposed to have all the extra stuff.
1007120	1013040	Pagle on Xbox Live Arcade, I downloaded and played for a while, and good times.
1013040	1018160	You know, I was already addicted to the one online, it's Sparkles and Rainbows and Plinko,
1018160	1019500	it's fun.
1019500	1022520	I need to play some more of the multiplayer though before I can kind of give my full impressions
1022520	1025680	on that, but I had fun playing Pagle, and I think a lot of people are going to check
1025680	1026680	this out.
1026680	1031880	What I like about Pagle versus PopCap's other efforts on Xbox Live, such as Bejeweled 2
1031880	1037280	and Zuma, is that this doesn't just feel like a port of their PC game, the full one, it
1037280	1042080	feels like they've really tinkered some stuff to work with Xbox Live, hence the multiplayer,
1042080	1045280	and they've really kind of made it special for Xbox Live, and I think that's what's kind
1045280	1049120	of cool about Pagle, it makes it really stand out amongst some of PopCap's other games they've
1049120	1050360	had on Xbox Live so far.
1050360	1053820	Not to say the other stuff was bad, but it was just kind of the same thing that I'd already
1053820	1059120	played on PC if I'd had the full version, and Pagle's kind of a step above that.
1059120	1062960	The last game I will mention that I played this week, Dance Dance Revolution Universe
1062960	1068120	3 was on sale, so I figured, what the heck, I picked it up, I bought it, because I got
1068120	1073000	a new dance mat for Xbox, whatever, and got to play Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3.
1073000	1077000	Do you want to know what the most hilarious thing about Dance Dance Revolution Universe
1077000	1078000	3 is?
1078000	1083160	Okay, they, on the back of the box, they advertise these songs that are in the game, one of them
1083160	1086000	being harder, better, faster, stronger, right?
1086000	1088180	So I was like, okay, I want to check that song out.
1088180	1089680	It's not in the game.
1089680	1094320	In fact, of all the songs that are mentioned on the back of the box, apparently only one
1094320	1098880	of them is actually in the game, and no, it's not, like, I looked on web forums, DDR Freak,
1098880	1103800	which is still kicking after all these years, who knew, DDR Freak apparently confirms these
1103800	1107280	songs are not in the game, but they're advertised on the back of the box.
1107280	1108280	Well, that's false advertising.
1108280	1109280	I know!
1109280	1110920	I say, we sue Konami.
1110920	1111920	What's up with that?
1111920	1113280	We'll turn it around on him.
1113280	1114280	Look, I understand.
1114280	1115760	No, we will sue Konami.
1115760	1120800	I understand mistakes happen and all, but this is a pretty fucking big mistake.
1120800	1122160	You know what I mean?
1122160	1123160	I don't know.
1123160	1126200	That's, that's, I'm surprised they're not trying to send out stickers to Critter.
1126200	1127960	How does something like that happen?
1127960	1130280	Like, who fucked up that bad?
1130280	1134440	It's been out for a while, they probably just figured no one has noticed, you know?
1134440	1135440	My god.
1135440	1141040	Um, but look, look, the game itself, look, putting the box aside and all that trite crap,
1141040	1143740	you know, the game itself is okay.
1143740	1145880	It's not my favorite home version of a DDR game.
1145880	1148720	In fact, I think I even preferred the song list in Universe 1.
1148720	1151400	It's definitely no Ultramix 2.
1151400	1152800	But it's not bad.
1152800	1159360	The interface is pretty slick, very crisp, very vibrant graphics, funny background animations,
1159360	1163680	2DX fan service, because they have the actual music video for Murmur Twins and some of that
1163680	1169240	stuff in the game, decent licensed songs, some really cute kind of original stuff.
1169240	1173360	A little heavy on certain in-house artists of Konami.
1173360	1176400	I guess maybe there's just been a shift over there where they're starting to use people
1176400	1183080	like Diamashura and 0039.com and some of these people are using them more often, it seems
1183080	1187760	like, than your Naoki, your Takus, and all these guys that probably left, which is why
1187760	1191000	they're having a shift.
1191000	1194420	Also I thought it was strange, the download content, the interface, you can't preview
1194420	1197800	the songs, I never heard of any of them, so I don't know what I want to download.
1197800	1199480	Do they even have download content?
1199480	1200640	My Universe, yeah they do.
1200640	1204920	My Universe 1 songs though did not come into Universe 3, but apparently there's a Universe
1204920	1208840	pack available, so I'm not sure if it's trying to make me re-buy the songs I already bought
1208840	1212480	with Universe 1, and if that's the case, that's kind of crappy.
1212480	1215560	There's a crap load of songs to unlock, so I'll give them a plus there.
1215560	1217360	There's tons and tons of songs to unlock.
1217360	1224260	Quest mode is a little silly though, and I hate how everybody speaks.
1224260	1228920	Everybody talks like people think ghetto people talk.
1228920	1235880	That's how the dialogue has gone, like the whole yo-dog type stuff, like, oh everybody,
1235880	1236880	it's just bad.
1236880	1239360	Dialogue by Randy Jackson.
1239360	1241360	It's bad.
1241360	1243840	Leo Shan asks, was the quest mode like you got served Sky?
1243840	1244840	No, it's weird.
1244840	1248760	It's like this big circular thing, and you go to these different places, and in the first
1248760	1253200	circle you gain coins to challenge people in the second circle, and if you beat them
1253200	1254320	you get the song.
1254320	1256840	It wasn't incredibly difficult.
1256840	1260280	I unlocked the entire second circle in one night, but now it won't let me go to the third
1260280	1263160	circle because I haven't played enough in the first circle, but I don't want to play
1263160	1266680	the easy stuff, but whatever.
1266680	1270720	Eventually you'll get to the seventh ring of hell.
1270720	1273840	It's just like, here's the thing, I don't want to necessarily give this game a negative
1273840	1277520	review because I don't think it's necessarily bad, and I do encourage people to play DDR
1277520	1281480	because I think it's a way to stay fit and exercise, and again, I think everything's
1281480	1282480	pretty sharp.
1282480	1285120	I don't necessarily like some of the creative direction they took in it.
1285120	1287560	I don't think the new quest mode is anything that exciting.
1287560	1289920	I don't think the new interface is that great.
1289920	1295960	I think having the giant CD cover box art thing in the wheels is a bit much.
1295960	1297840	I don't go for it.
1297840	1300960	I'm telling you, if you make me the production director of this series, I could bring it
1300960	1304560	around like nothing.
1304560	1307040	It's not necessarily bad.
1307040	1313720	It's just another DDR game, and at this point these things are a dime a dozen, so I really
1313720	1319720	want to see the DDR teams at Konami really try to reinvent this stuff, and for the love
1319720	1323080	of God, whoever made that big mistake about putting songs on there that weren't actually
1323080	1332040	in the game, that just kind of speaks as to how lazy they're getting.
1332040	1335460	It's not necessarily a big deal, okay, so somebody made a mistake, whatever, but it
1335460	1340000	just speaks volume as to how lazy it feels like they're getting with DDR, which is sad
1340000	1342760	because I know there's a lot of people that work very hard on this series.
1342760	1346080	I've had friends who worked for the series that work very hard on it.
1346080	1348880	It's some of these creative things coming up from the top level.
1348880	1352720	I'm surprised they didn't make a big deal about that everywhere, because hell, they
1352720	1358240	made a big deal out of the IGN watermark being on the Okami cover, and that was something
1358240	1361520	really stupid and small and had no impact really on the game.
1361520	1368880	I don't know, and then there was Super Stardust Portable that was missing modes and stuff
1368880	1371020	that were advertised on there.
1371020	1375200	This is kind of a big deal that there's songs missing from the game that are advertised
1375200	1380320	on there, because that right there, say if you bought it for that song, you're being
1380320	1385080	ripped off right there, and the fact that it's not available for...
1385080	1388840	I don't think even download content would cut it, and it would have to be free download
1388840	1393240	content or a patch or something that would get automatically added to the game or something
1393240	1398360	when you connect it live, but I don't know, it's just cheap and they could have easily
1398360	1404800	affixed it with a sticker or something to go over that part of the box, that way it's
1404800	1410240	gone or something, say at the last minute they decided to pull the rights to it or something.
1410240	1412280	It screams lazy, that's all it is.
1412280	1415960	And I'm just saying, companies, don't think we don't notice when y'all get lazy.
1415960	1422000	There are people that notice and there are people that go, okay, I'm spending $60 of
1422000	1426840	my money on this game, take five seconds to...
1426840	1428720	It's like Nintendo again.
1428720	1431560	Or delay it, that's what every other company does.
1431560	1437320	The problem is, in their quest to branch out to people that haven't tried their games before,
1437320	1441360	or people that normally don't play their games, they have in turn lost the people that do
1441360	1444640	play their games, because they just don't care anymore.
1444640	1449480	It's like shifting your focus to actually increase your market share with groups of
1449480	1453680	people that don't normally play your games, and ignoring your core players and thinking
1453680	1458200	they're just going to stick around is not the way to be thinking.
1458200	1461600	Here's my challenge, this is my last thing I want to say, because I know there are people
1461600	1465480	at Konami that listen to this program, and I'm not just talking about people that are
1465480	1468800	like my personal friends and what have you, but I know there's people higher up.
1468800	1474000	Look, less than three is one of the songs in freaking DDR Universe 3, the same song
1474000	1478020	that was a theme song to Rice Princess' show she had on the old station, okay?
1478020	1483160	If that doesn't prove somebody at Konami is looking out for us, I don't know what does,
1483160	1484160	okay?
1484160	1488520	Here's the thing I want to say to y'all, look, I love DDR, DDR has introduced me to a lot
1488520	1491520	of great people, I would not know Loki, I would not know Dark Soccer if it were not
1491520	1498000	for DDR, however, that being said, do not throw away a good thing, do not be afraid
1498000	1503820	to reinvent yourselves, and I challenge you, step away from making, resist the temptation
1503820	1511000	of doing a Universe 4, or X2, or Disney 3, I want you to nuke your code and start from
1511000	1517560	the ground up, build a new DDR game from the ground up, no recycled code, make a brand
1517560	1521120	new DDR game, and really try to push the limits of what you're doing with it, I think you
1521120	1525820	would really stand to win back a lot of people that are starting to think you're getting
1525820	1526820	a little lazy.
1526820	1530480	They did it before, and what did it do for the community for a while, I mean it really
1530480	1535960	rejuvenated everything when we got the Max series, remember when it was new?
1535960	1540440	And honestly, DDR UltraMix, especially 2, not so much UltraMix 1, but UltraMix 2, and
1540440	1545080	they really were getting in their groove, no pun intended, sold me on an Xbox, it really
1545080	1546080	did.
1546080	1548880	And that was all new code, because they had to make it for the Xbox.
1548880	1552760	Also the other thing too, I think, is the way that they're treating their series, I
1552760	1557880	mean look at Pump It Up, and the new versions of that game, there's a lot of excitement
1557880	1561320	behind it, they bring it out, it's like, BAM, it's a new game, it's awesome, it's got all
1561320	1566280	these things in it, and people get excited about it, but DDR, it's like, oh, new DDR,
1566280	1574960	hooray, this time it's got more Disney characters, hurrah, it's just that no one cares anymore,
1574960	1578960	and they need to really change it up, I'm serious, I have a way to fix this, but no
1578960	1584320	one wants to listen, and I don't feel like explaining it, because, well, it's just, it's
1584320	1587360	all in my head, and unfortunately I can't put it on paper very, you know, but I can
1587360	1592800	explain it, basically the whole quest mode thing, taking a totally different approach
1592800	1598000	to that, basically you have stuff that goes along, because the problem with quest mode
1598000	1603020	is they don't know how to make it where it actually matters, I mean, you can't obviously
1603020	1607440	do it as like a dance off competition thing, because it doesn't make any sense, it's just,
1607440	1611840	you can't do that in DDR, because it's a technical game, it's not based on, you know, doing moves
1611840	1617520	and that kind of crap, but if you make it as something different, like say for example,
1617520	1621220	how well you're doing in a song affects the performance of say, something else that's
1621220	1626280	going on, totally separate things, you know, just basically instead of, you know, your
1626280	1631960	actions on a gamepad or something like that, it's based on the accuracy of, you know, the
1631960	1635640	steps that you're hitting and that kind of stuff, if you make that interact with the
1635640	1640160	other thing that's going on, you can make the quest mode about anything you want, and
1640160	1644440	it doesn't have to be about DDR or anything, you can just really broaden it out there.
1644440	1649160	Alright, we'll see if anyone's listening, you can contact Loki directly at loki at orange
1649160	1652280	launch reader dot com, I'm sure he'll talk your ear off about it. Let me read some comments
1652280	1655880	from chat, I don't want to spend too much more time on DDR, because since we have branched
1655880	1658760	out the scope of our show, I know there's some people that listen that don't really
1658760	1664400	care as much about the music games, but I will say this though, good exercise, you know,
1664400	1670520	if you've never played DDR, try it for the exercise alone. Let's see, comments from chat,
1670520	1675040	Float Walk says two words, national tournament, that's definitely what Pump It Up does, you
1675040	1680120	know, the tournaments they do in Korea are huge, and Float Walk says for crying out loud
1680120	1685720	the tournament scene made DDR's popularity in the states, true facts. Acidic Vampire
1685720	1692160	says what DDR needs is violence like Madworld. DDR does not need violence, at least not that
1692160	1698280	level of violence, I mean, no, it doesn't need that. DDR needs fatalities. But I do
1698280	1702840	agree that you could take the quest mode and literally make it like an RPG type thing,
1702840	1709840	you know, like it's, I don't know, it's, it's hard. No, no, no, no, no, no, I will tell
1709840	1714420	you a reason why RPG stuff will never work with Dance Dance Revolution, and it all goes
1714420	1721440	back to a little known game called Dance Dance Dance. No. I think I remember that game, yeah.
1721440	1727560	Yes, I've played it, and yes it sucks. Alright, anyhow, let's move on, I don't want to spend
1727560	1731640	too much time re-re-reminiscing the old days, although that's kind of what I did this week
1731640	1737000	by going to Golf Land, so there you go. Alright, since that does it for our gaming week, let's
1737000	1740680	get to some housekeeping. Alright, so look, we've sat here and kind of been critical of
1740680	1746920	DDR for the last few minutes, but I will say this, you know, at our heart we do love Konami,
1746920	1753160	and so on, on our website www.orangelandrater.com, they actually have been polling all of our
1753160	1757840	listeners all week long about your top three favorite Konami games since their 40th birthday
1757840	1762580	is coming up, and we're giving them a present now with this week long feature of the best
1762580	1767880	games as selected by you guys, the listeners, from Konami's archives. 1500 Konami games
1767880	1774320	over the years, if you can believe it. Speaking of voting, March Madness is almost over, it's
1774320	1779600	down to the final four, and right now you have Rock Band versus Super Mario Bros. 3,
1779600	1784960	and you have Chrono Trigger versus Zelda Link to the Past, and I believe voting time is
1784960	1788720	going to be up very, very soon, so if you're listening live here on this Sunday evening,
1788720	1791880	you're going to want to go try to get in your last minute votes, and the final two will
1791880	1798920	probably be decided tonight. March 22nd, next week, I'm not going to be here, so I'm not
1798920	1803440	sure if there's going to be a show or not. Stay tuned to our website www.orangelandrater.com
1803440	1807640	for more details, I think they might try to find a way to tape elsewhere, but I will not
1807640	1811220	be here next week, I'm going to be on a trip, but I will be back in two weeks, so we'll
1811220	1816320	keep you posted. Alright, that's really it for housekeeping, just stay tuned to our website.
1816320	1820760	Actually I want to say something about the website real fast, actually. I feel like I've
1820760	1823560	kind of been slacking off, because I haven't been doing a lot of articles for the website
1823560	1828840	or what have you, but it has been so refreshing to go to orangelandrater.com, and I'm seeing
1828840	1835660	new stuff every day, it's completely unreal, but some of our long-time listeners, like
1835660	1841280	Deakman, ActDeaf, DarkTedTsuya, and I'm sure the list goes on, I don't mean to leave people
1841280	1845840	out, but they've been writing articles about indie game spotlights, games you ought to
1845840	1851600	be playing, but you probably aren't, and highlighting music from video games, and it's been actually
1851600	1855520	really cool to kind of go to the site and see this stuff. And what I love about it,
1855520	1859920	is that in a way it's because we're not doing it, it's kind of what this show is all about,
1859920	1863240	letting the listeners have control, and the community, and what the community wants to
1863240	1868040	hear about, so props to you guys who've all been working hard on the website, it's been
1868040	1873520	pretty awesome. And I have an idea for a feature too that I'm hoping to contribute very soon,
1873520	1879080	and I'll be back on posting regular updates very soon. Okay, now I think that's it for
1879080	1883040	housekeeping, let's get into some gaming news, we're only like 30 minutes into the show,
1883040	1889960	let's get to it. Loki, start us off with some gaming news. Yes, so anyways, there has been
1889960	1901960	some concern by MTV's Totillo that there might not be enough exclusives during 2009 for the
1901960	1908320	Xbox 360. Now, unfortunately what Steven doesn't realize is that there are, but he just doesn't
1908320	1912000	understand that there are a lot of things coming out that people think that aren't exclusive
1912000	1916000	are exclusive, and that they think that are exclusive that aren't exclusive, so it's kind
1916000	1925400	of confusing. For example, he says the loss of Xbox exclusive franchises like Mass Effect,
1925400	1931880	unfortunately for him, Mass Effect, I don't think, as of right now, is not, well it is
1931880	1937620	multi-platform, but not with the PS3. So, you know, because right now I think there's
1937620	1943360	only a SKU listing for the Xbox 360 version, I think the other platform they're talking
1943360	1947000	about was PC, which makes sense, because they've released them both, but I think it is going
1947000	1951600	to be exclusive for Xbox 360 right now. And Project Gotham Racing, well, Project Gotham
1951600	1955680	Racing I don't think is even going to be existing anymore, at least if they are going to do
1955680	1959080	another Project Gotham Racing game, I think it's not going to be called Project Gotham
1959080	1963320	Racing, it'll probably be something different, but hey, who cares. And then of course Splinter
1963320	1967960	Cell Conviction, whenever the hell that comes out, you know, obviously it might be one that's
1967960	1974480	going to be on 360, and Alan Wake, also whenever that comes out as well. Then of course there's
1974480	1983000	also Halo 3 ODST, or whatever they're calling it now, and I mean that's just for right now.
1983000	1986360	Obviously they haven't really been talking much about their 2009 lineup, which they're
1986360	1990180	probably saving for E3, you know, they're just going to be like, bam bam bam bam, here's
1990180	1996320	all this shit, you know, that's coming out. But, do you think they are going to, at E3,
1996320	2002720	just blow us away? Um, maybe. I mean, because there's, I can kind of see where this guy
2002720	2007040	has some concerns for Xbox 360, because even, you know, they don't have a big Halo 3 this
2007040	2010360	year or anything of that caliber, I mean, granted you had Halo Wars, but it's not the
2010360	2014900	same thing. You know, there's no big, big must-have title, it feels like we got a lot
2014900	2021200	of that last year. Well, they're not going to let us down with just, you know, the Halo
2021200	2025340	ODST, and that could be what they consider their big title, but then again, that's also
2025340	2028800	right now for September, that's scheduled for September. I mean, we very well could
2028800	2032520	get something else, I don't know if they were going to get another Gears of War, to be honest
2032520	2037920	I hope not, you know, give it some space, but I think there's going to be other things
2037920	2043800	coming out for sure, because they definitely don't like leaving in a lot of months without
2043800	2048240	a Microsoft game coming out, and you know, right now we just had Halo Wars come out,
2048240	2052520	Ninja Blade's coming out pretty soon, you know, there's still a lot more months that
2052520	2056560	there's nothing been announced yet, and I wouldn't be surprised if there's other things,
2056560	2059680	and that's only first-party exclusives, we're not even talking about third-party exclusives
2059680	2065120	yet, but you know, right now, there are a lot of companies that just don't want to develop
2065120	2069640	for the PS3, or they're having trouble developing on the PS3, and it's taken them a lot longer
2069640	2074960	to put out the PS3 version. For example, this isn't a great game, but Leisure Suit Larry
2074960	2080760	boxed off his bus, coming out on 360 in a couple weeks, and the PS3 version's been delayed
2080760	2087640	to May. Another one that people thought is also going to be exclusive to the Xbox 360,
2087640	2092280	at least a timed exclusive, is Bioshock 2, right now I'm not seeing that, right now it's
2092280	2096920	day and date with the PS3 version, but of course, that can change, that's months off
2096920	2102200	right now, so I wouldn't be surprised if there is going to be a lot more stuff announced,
2102200	2106920	and Bioshock 2 is going to be a huge Christmas title, but it's not specific to any system.
2106920	2111240	Yeah, well, I think it actually is going to be coming out in August, just like it did
2111240	2115560	the first time, but there's tons of stuff coming out that we don't know about yet, that
2115560	2121840	are going to be big titles, and I'm sure that each side, both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 are
2121840	2126760	both going to have exclusive titles that are going to be really awesome, so I don't really
2126760	2131520	think it matters about the exclusive titles, because there's just more titles coming out
2131520	2139640	on the Xbox 360 right now, period. Alright, you know, and also, one thing that Microsoft
2139640	2143200	usually does, and I'm sure Nintendo and Sony are going to do this too, especially speaking
2143200	2147960	of E3, you know, they like to unveil things to these big events that are available on
2147960	2151360	live right now, or on PlayStation Network right now. There's something else too that
2151360	2155080	I totally forgot about, Game Developers Conference, which I think is what, next week? Oh yeah.
2155080	2159120	Yeah, so I mean, there's going to be announcements probably there as well, I mean, there's lots
2159120	2163200	of stuff, and not only that, but they're not only focusing on just console stuff, I mean,
2163200	2169320	you've got XNA, which is really hitting its strides now, Xbox Live Arcade, who knows what
2169320	2171320	they're going to go with. I don't think at Game Developers Conference, though, you're
2171320	2175840	going to get huge game announcements, but I think you'll get, like, infrastructure type
2175840	2179440	things. Like, remember, Game Developers Conference was where, like, Home was announced. That
2179440	2185600	was kind of an enhancement to Sony's platform. I don't think XNA was announced at, or no,
2185600	2189600	I mean, XNA was, I mean, NXC, the new Xbox experience, I don't think that was announced
2189600	2192240	at Game Developers Conference, but I could see that being the type of thing, you know,
2192240	2195880	things that affect the developers, you know, things that affect the backbones of these
2195880	2199200	systems, or the types of announcements I would expect to see, you know, upgrades and things
2199200	2202500	of that note. Maybe this would be a great time for Nintendo to finally put out that
2202500	2207080	SD card thing they've been talking about. That would be great. I've got a 2GB card right
2207080	2215800	here, right here, just waiting to go in the Wii, to store all my crap. So, I'm hoping
2215800	2220920	that thing will come out soon. Alright, well, there will be, actually, wait, I've got to
2220920	2223160	read, there will be some comments from chat right now, that's the one I've got to read
2223160	2228600	right now. AcidicVampire is betting at E3 this year, Microsoft will reveal that Final
2228600	2236120	Fantasy XIII Versus will be on the Xbox 360. Hmm. I doubt that. You never know. GameGuru
2236120	2239520	says, Microsoft at E3 will announce that the best non-Sony games that are appearing on
2239520	2245040	PlayStation 3 will also be on the Xbox 360. Amazetatsuma corrects me and says, Microsoft
2245040	2250120	did Gears 2 was announced at Game Developers Conference. So, it is not unheard of for games
2250120	2255320	to be announced at E3. Yeah, because they're talking about the enhancements to Unreal 3,
2255320	2259520	that stuff. You might hear something about Unreal 4, maybe, I don't know, that might
2259520	2266240	be interesting. That could be. Maybe some stuff from id from about Doom 4, because I
2266240	2270480	think they're going to be talking about that and probably rage a little bit. What was I
2270480	2277200	going to say, though, yeah, the whole rumor thing about, like, Final Fantasy Versus, Square
2277200	2281840	has kind of already done that with Xbox 360. If you notice, the last few games that they
2281840	2288000	put out have been only on Xbox 360, and have been exclusive. Star Ocean, Last Hope, The
2288000	2296000	Last Remnant, before that, oh gosh, I'm forgetting now, but yeah, a lot of their RPGs are going
2296000	2301200	to be, you know, strictly on the Xbox 360, but now they're going to start getting some
2301200	2303600	PS3 ones. Infinite Undiscovery, was the other one you were talking about? Yeah, Infinite
2303600	2310120	Undiscovery, that was what I was thinking. Stuff I did not buy. I don't know, so there's
2310120	2313080	going to be a lot of companies that are going to be developing for them, because it's easier
2313080	2319080	to develop on that platform, unless Sony figures out a way to educate these guys a lot faster
2319080	2324000	and figure out how to develop for a lot easier, you know, that's going to be the problems
2324000	2328400	they're going to face, and right now, being this far into the console cycle, it's probably
2328400	2332520	not going to change. So we'll just have to wait for the next round, and we'll see how
2332520	2335880	it goes there. Alright, well let's keep moving with the news here, because we're running
2335880	2339040	kind of long tonight, but that's alright, good discussion, right DarkSakura? What else
2339040	2343640	is new, huh? I know, we're always running long, we're a big fat bloated shell. Hey,
2343640	2347360	let's talk about some other Xbox 360 releases, but this is actually one for Japan, this is
2347360	2350360	something that's going to be coming out in Japan. Obviously, Microsoft's had a little
2350360	2353800	difficulty trying to penetrate the market in Japan, and you know, thanks to some of
2353800	2357360	these, you know, role playing games that Loki was talking about earlier, they've had a little
2357360	2362200	bit of luck, but they still have yet to really just break through and be massive over there.
2362200	2367280	Maybe this will help, because the Japanese love their shmups, shoot em up, shmup. This
2367280	2371640	one is called Mamoru-kun Has Been Cursed, that would be the English translation of this
2371640	2377720	title. It is coming out on the Xbox 360, it's going to come with a soundtrack CD and a super
2377720	2382000	play DVD, that's a limited edition that's coming out on the Xbox 360, coming out for
2382000	2387920	8500 yen, but if you want the regular edition, it's 5980 yen. Now let me tell you a little
2387920	2392360	bit about this game here, it's been developed by G-Rev, and apparently it does some type
2392360	2400320	of, it has character designs in it by Mizuki Takayama, he did some other famous shmup games.
2400320	2404400	This is actually a translation of an arcade game. Looks like you play a little dude, you're
2404400	2407760	not actually a ship, but it looks like you're actually a little person that's walking around
2407760	2412560	kind of doing the fighting, so kind of interesting. It's about an elementary school student who
2412560	2418000	finds themselves in a nightmarish underworld, so it definitely looks kind of cool. The interesting
2418000	2421620	thing though about these shmups, they don't translate well for widescreen systems, because
2421620	2426080	you know, shmups are usually very vertical-oriented, you can't really turn your TV on its side,
2426080	2429080	so you only end up using a very small portion of the screen. You can if you have a really
2429080	2434240	kick-ass mounting setup. That's true, but people don't usually have that. Well, my husband's
2434240	2440720	new monitor, the widescreen HDMI, has access to PivotOn, and actually a lot more that you're
2440720	2447940	finding these days are built to shift position. And I think some of the games, even the Xbox
2447940	2451840	Live arcade games like Ikaruga I think did support that as well. We have a few Saturn
2451840	2454880	games that actually will let you do that, I can think Thunderblade, one of the Thunderblade
2454880	2459880	games will do it. Well, just to give you an idea of some of the other things that G-Rev
2459880	2464920	has developed, because it's coming out here, they did do some work with Ikaruga and Gradius
2464920	2468200	5, just so you know. They did some programming and background graphic design for Ikaruga
2468200	2472920	and same thing for Gradius 5, so they have touched those games, and they've also done
2472920	2478280	some work with Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker, which is an old school Dreamcast game. So
2478280	2482320	there you go! This game, a shmup coming out in Japan, no word if it's coming out over
2482320	2487280	here, although I gotta be honest, probably not. Well, how about we shift gears a little
2487280	2495360	bit? Ah ha ha! Cause it's Gears of War 2 patches! Isn't that fun, Rob? Cool! Well, there's going
2495360	2500840	to be a premium map pack called Snowblind that's coming out on March 31st, and it'll
2500840	2508400	have three new maps and a remake of Fuel Depot from the first Gears of War, and it's supposed
2508400	2513880	to bring in experience-based ranking and rebalance the gameplay a bit more, try to give everyone
2513880	2520120	a better sense of progression, and you'll still be using the true skill system, but
2520120	2526720	it's sort of background now. It's really just something to make people feel more, you know,
2526720	2533320	rewarded for how well they do. So you can earn your experience in matches that will
2533320	2539400	get you through 100 levels, you get milestones for, you know, each level, I think, each certain
2539400	2544480	level that you get, so you get an achievement for it, as well as, of course, the packs.
2544480	2549960	So there's a possibility of getting another 250 gamer score points. There's an auto-balancing
2549960	2558320	feature that will put a bot in place if you fall out during mid-match, although you also
2558320	2571040	get an XP penalty, and it will correct scoring issues. So there's no real price on the map
2571040	2579800	pack yet, but as comparison, the combustible map pack is 800 Microsoft points. So the maps
2579800	2587800	that are coming with this, one's called Grindyard, that's a wintery junkyard processing plant
2587800	2595800	thing. It's supposed to be a spiritual successor to Gridlock. There's Underhill and Courtyard
2595800	2603000	also, in addition to the Fuel Depot remake. Very nice. And ActDeft approves in our chat
2603000	2607280	room, Fuel Depot was the best map of the first Gears of War, says ActDeft. That's probably
2607280	2611080	why they're bringing it back. That's probably why it's coming back for another round, absolutely.
2611080	2615780	We like it! Okay, here. Yay! And of course people are going to be excited that they can
2615780	2619560	increase their gamer score by another 250 points. Here goes your E-peen! Well, I just
2619560	2623840	want to say, my E-peen hit a landmark today. Where's your E-peen at? Just today. I crossed
2623840	2629840	10,000 gamer score today. Woo-hoo! I don't think I'm even nearly there. I think I'm like
2629840	2634400	under 1,000 still. That's alright, slow and steady wins the race. Took me a few years
2634400	2638400	to get here. Slow and steady means Jamie's got other stuff to do. Well, you have to play
2638400	2642600	games with really easy gamer score too, like DDR, like you get an A on a song, you get
2642600	2648560	50 points, you know things like this. You have entered a shop, champagne! Exactly. So
2648560	2656900	apparently, there's a good use for some of your Xbox 360 systems that may be broken.
2656900	2661600	One use, of course, would be to convert it into a bong, and that's what someone has done,
2661600	2666720	actually. They have converted their Xbox 360 system into a bong. Obviously, it doesn't
2666720	2673960	work anymore, and I'm sure it's been gutted, but yes, now it is a bong, and you can smoke
2673960	2679280	out of it. Awesome. But, of course, you would only smoke tobacco out of it, right? Of course,
2679280	2684200	because anything else would be illegal. Because, you know, everybody smokes tobacco out of
2684200	2691560	bongs. Right. Actually, I do know people who actually will do tobacco in a bong, but I
2691560	2695760	don't do ginseng and other stuff. Is that like a hookah type thing? Yeah, it's pretty
2695760	2702280	much just a modified hookah, but it's the same difference. But, I'm looking at the picture
2702280	2708560	of it, and I would do better with that. I mean, would you really want to turn your Xbox
2708560	2713000	360, of all things, into a bong? I'd be calling it the Xbox 420. Well, to be honest, you wouldn't
2713000	2718320	have to necessarily have an Xbox 360. You could buy a replacement case, and it's like,
2718320	2722600	just buy a bong. I mean, seriously, it's not even worth, you know, just setting it up.
2722600	2728040	Class, you get a hookah. It's like, why bother, you know? Why bother other than, oh, look,
2728040	2731720	I did that. Okay, great. Now one person's converted their system into a bong, no one
2731720	2736000	else needs to do it, because it's a waste of time. Alright, alright. Am I the only person
2736000	2741640	here who's reminded of Dennis Leary? How so? Saying that smoking pot doesn't lead to other
2741640	2748160	drugs, it leads to carpentry? Perhaps. AcidicVampire in chat says, if you use your
2748160	2754080	360 as a bong, you will see Yaris. This is possible. This is very possible. Alright,
2754080	2759820	look, look. Don't turn your 360 into a bong. Get it to work again so that you can get new
2759820	2764100	games on it. Although this game is not on the 360, but it's a developer that makes a
2764100	2771680	lot of games for 360. PopCap is giving away a free game. That's right, a free game. It's
2771680	2776480	actually, I believe, going on right now. It's kind of like a St. Patrick's Day promotion.
2776480	2782440	It's going to go through March 24th. The game you can get is Big Money. You can get the
2782440	2788400	game for free on PopCap. So go check it out. Big Money, kind of like the game Poppet, if
2788400	2795480	you've ever played it with the balloons. You're basically trying to make, you know, like four
2795480	2800200	of the same color that touch, and it has a money theme going to it, yeah. It's just like
2800200	2803120	the balloon game if you've ever played it, but kind of like, oh no, don't you click them
2803120	2807120	away in this one. When you see matches of four, you click on it, and then they go away
2807120	2810680	and everything compresses together. I think that's this one. That's how the balloon one
2810680	2816440	is. So there it is. You click on them, and then it compresses together, and you don't
2816440	2819640	want it to go past the top of the screen. I've played this before, like a long time
2819640	2823680	ago, but it's free, so now I can go play it again, unlimited, but I have to get it before
2823680	2830720	the 24th. So check it out. And as Zach Def says in chat, Big Money, Big Money, no whammies,
2830720	2837560	stop! No, it's not that kind of big money, sorry to say. Maybe someday on one of those
2837560	2841440	live. You need to play your gift. I want to get people over and play the pressure. It'll
2841440	2845280	be fun. I have the Press Your Luck DVD game. That's what Dark Sakura's talking about. It'll
2845280	2850160	be fun. Alright. How about some release dates? How about it, Rob? Let's start in the UK with
2850160	2856600	Dark Sakura. Well, there's really, um, most of them are on the 20th. There is a game being
2856600	2863140	released on the 18th, which is The Path on PC, which I know nothing about. Um, then there's
2863140	2868600	some stuff on the 20th. As I said, there's Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on DS, Mad
2868600	2875600	World on Wii, which is beautiful and completely bloodlicious. There's Ready to Rumble Revolution
2875600	2881520	on Wii, Rhapsody a musical- didn't Rhapsody already come out? I don't know. No, Rhapsody
2881520	2890200	a musical adventure on DS, The Last Remnant on PC, The Wheelman on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation
2890200	2897000	3. And that's it. The US doesn't have much coming out, unfortunately, this week. Starting
2897000	2902560	things off, of course, we have, um, you know, on the DS, and I think this is held over from
2902560	2908100	last week, but World Championship Games, a track and field event, um, it got delayed
2908100	2915360	to, um, Monday. And that's on the DS, also Valkyrie Profile coming in the plume, also
2915360	2921440	coming out on Monday on the DS. Um, Tuesday is when we have most of the stuff coming out,
2921440	2927520	including, um, another DS game, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Also on the DS, Henry
2927520	2932720	Hatsworth in a Puzzling Adventure, which is pretty cool, kind of combines puzzle and platforming
2932720	2940520	there. Um, also on the DS, Mind, Body, and Soul Big World Puzzle Book. Um, on another
2940520	2946720	Nintendo platform, on the Wii, we have Ready the Rumble Revolution, also Provolution Soccer
2946720	2957160	2009 on the Wii as well. Um, also have Rune Factory Frontier, and some more DS titles.
2957160	2966120	We have on the DS and PSP Scrabble, on PlayStation 2, Sing Star Queen, also on the DS, Suicoden
2966120	2977360	T-Crease, um, Trackmania DS, also on the DS, and on the Wii, Crayola Adventures Colorful
2977360	2986360	World. Wow, that sounds awesome. Not. Awesomely bad. Awesomely bad, yes. Um, let's see, this
2986360	2992580	week on Xbox Live Arcade, we're supposed to be getting Hasbro Family Game Night, also
2992580	3002040	on DS, SBK08, Superbike World Championship. On PC, a few things, The Path, Runes of Magic,
3002040	3012320	Grand Ages Rome, Ether Saga Online, Tom Clancy's Hawks, and Woman's Murder Club, A Darker Shade
3012320	3019320	of Grey, oh, and Men of War. That's it, pretty kind of lame release week, but, oh, and on
3019320	3024480	PSP, how could I forget this, I was actually going to play this, Resistance Retribution.
3024480	3027520	Can't wait to check out the, like, linking stuff on that. Actually, I can't wait to finish
3027520	3031640	Resistance 2, since I haven't really played much of that. Hey, quick question for you,
3031640	3034480	completely random, but since you know about, you know, games that are in demand and all
3034480	3038840	that stuff, um, what's up with the Retro Game Challenge? I tried to go to Best Buy to get
3038840	3041880	it the other day, and they said they had none in stock, and they weren't expecting any more.
3041880	3046760	Is this, is this like a hard to find game now? I guess. It's Atlas, so Atlas puts out
3046760	3051320	their games in very limited quantities, and a lot of these places, you know, think it's
3051320	3055820	going to be too niche of a title, and so they don't bring it in. And then people start asking
3055820	3061160	for it, and then you can't find it. Interesting. I know, because I actually was hearing Bobby
3061160	3063960	say good things about it last week, and he's not the only one, so my other friends are
3063960	3066420	talking about how they enjoyed Retro Game Challenge, so I was actually going to pick
3066420	3071360	it up on the DS, and then I can't find it. Oh well. I'll just get it on Amazon or something,
3071360	3075920	I guess, if I have to. Alright, let's go over to Japanese release dates, and actually also
3075920	3082680	Slow Week in Japan. On the Xbox 360, nothing. On the Playstation 3, MLB 09 The Show is coming
3082680	3088600	out in other Asian regions, not just Japan. It's kind of making an Asia release, so otherwise
3088600	3094080	as far as Japanese only games, nothing. How about the Nintendo Wii? Now you get some stuff
3094080	3100040	for Japan. Darts Wii Deluxe, Monopoly Here and Now the World Edition, Tiger Woods PGA
3100040	3104480	Tour 09 All Play, and Winter Sports 2009 The Next Challenge, all of those titles coming
3104480	3109640	out on the 19th of March. Checking the handhelds out, actually first I want to mention on the
3109640	3116200	Playstation 2, there's a couple price reductions on the games Naraku no Shiro and Sankokushi
3116200	3124080	X get price reductions on the Playstation 2. As far as the Nintendo DS goes, Dengeki
3124080	3131020	Gakuken Cross of Venus RPG is coming out on March 19th, as well as Gardening Mama makes
3131020	3137000	its Japanese debut on March 19th. Are you interested in Gardening Mama, Dark Sakura?
3137000	3140440	Because I knew you were a big fan of a Cookie Mama. I would rather just cook it and have
3140440	3148240	someone else do my gardening for me. Let's see, also coming out, Kuroshitsuji Phantom
3148240	3155000	and Ghost comes out from Squeenix on the 19th of March, and the Pets series also making
3155000	3160440	its way to Japan. Cats, Dogs, Horses and Monkeys, those are all separate games making their
3160440	3166500	release in Japan. Zookeeper gets a price reduction, that game's been out forever. You finally
3166500	3169800	get that in Japan. Let's take a quick look at the PSP, see if there's anything I want
3169800	3176000	to mention on the PSP. Yeah, Dragon Ball Evolution comes out on the PSP this week in Japan. Yeah,
3176000	3182600	that's gonna suck. A game based on live action Dragon Ball Z, well, Dragon Ball movie. I
3182600	3187840	don't make them, I just report them. Not gonna see it. You can get PSPs now in bright yellow
3187840	3192040	and what they call Spirited Green. Those are some new things that are coming out this week
3192040	3197280	as well. Those actually look pretty hot. Are the PSPs region free? Yes. That green one's
3197280	3203080	really good looking actually. I wouldn't mind one of those. They're region free as far as
3203080	3209160	games go, not UMDs. Although, if you put a custom firmware on there, that's not an issue,
3209160	3217560	so. Tempting. Yes. That's it for release dates. So, let's go back into the gaming news, Dark
3217560	3224740	Sakura. Well, you know, Amazon's been having a new deal now with their game downloads where
3224740	3234520	you can basically buy a game to download for $9.99 or less according to their ad. And a
3234520	3240760	bunch of game developers are not happy about it because they think that their games should
3240760	3247740	be sold for more. So, PopCap and iWin actually pulled a lot of their games off of Amazon
3247740	3255220	saying that it was completely unacceptable. For example, they'd want to put like Jewel
3255220	3262520	Quest for $19.99 and think that $9.99 is way, way too low. That 20 bucks is an acceptable
3262520	3268720	price, 10 bucks is not. So, you can't get those anymore and from what I understand,
3268720	3279040	the rest of the selection is kind of ass. Interesting. Hmm. Oh well. There's a pretty
3279040	3289960	cool update, I guess, possibly in the, I guess, rumored future here for Burnout Paradise.
3289960	3296640	Now you may remember, I think at CES they were showing off a little bit of the 3D technology
3296640	3302360	you know with those special glasses that you can wear and stuff like that. That can be
3302360	3307360	used in say different computer games. I believe they're also showing some of the PS3 games
3307360	3313040	off in it as well like Wipeout HD and stuff like that. Well, one game that may get this
3313040	3320120	upgrade in the future, and this might be something we'll see at GDC, would be Burnout Paradise.
3320120	3324980	And of course, Burnout Paradise, I mean, I love all the upgrades and updates that they're
3324980	3331600	doing to it. It's really awesome. So, adding 3D to it would be pretty awesome as well.
3331600	3336120	And if only they could use those polarized glasses that they hand out in the 3D movies
3336120	3339160	and stuff, because I have a few pairs of those sitting at home. Aren't you supposed to return
3339160	3344140	those as you leave the theater? You don't have to. The fancy IMAX ones you do. Let me
3344140	3347780	put it this way. Well, the fancy IMAX ones I can understand because they're like shutter
3347780	3351340	glasses and stuff like that, but the polarized glasses, they can go fuck themselves because
3351340	3356640	I have to pay for those glasses. I'm keeping that shit, okay? I can understand that. So,
3356640	3360320	you know, I'm not recycling crap because they're just going to put that back in a package and
3360320	3366400	sell it to me again. No, screw it. Not to say that you can't take the glasses out of
3366400	3369480	Disneyland either because they have the Honey I Shrunk the Audience or whatever. You can
3369480	3372600	get the 3D glasses for that. No, they actually have a cast member waiting there for you to
3372600	3377480	dump them off. That's fine. But the Muppet show one's freaking awesome. But I'm saying,
3377480	3381320	you know, if I have to pay for the glasses, like they're like, oh, the glasses are an
3381320	3388920	extra $5, I'm keeping the glasses. That I can understand. So, all right. Well, I guess
3388920	3393120	kind of changing topics here a little bit. Talking about this story out of the UK, there's
3393120	3398960	this campaign called the Change for Life campaign over in the UK. What's interesting about this
3398960	3404060	is it's trying to, I guess you could say it's a campaign, an ad campaign trying to get folks
3404060	3411520	to not play video games, basically insinuating that video games cause obesity, diabetes,
3411520	3416440	cancer and so on and so on. Just all these bad things. And basically trying to get people
3416440	3420660	to go out and about. For instance, let me read the text on one of their ads here. Risk
3420660	3426240	an early death. Do nothing. 9 out of 10 kids risk growing up to have unhealthy amounts
3426240	3430080	of fat in their bodies. Even if you think they look healthy today, adult could bring
3430080	3434400	an early death from heart disease, type 2 diabetes or cancer. So make sure your kids
3434400	3439640	are active for an hour a day. Reduce how much fat they eat. For more advice, visit this
3439640	3444280	website. And what's interesting about this particular ad that I'm reading from in particular
3444280	3448560	is it features a little kid sitting on the couch holding a PlayStation controller in
3448560	3453520	their hand. Like, oh, I'm just sitting here lazy looking, you know, half dead. Yeah. Well,
3453520	3458440	but he definitely looks bored playing PlayStation games, which, you know, there, there are quite
3458440	3462120	a lot of boring PlayStation 3 games are out right now. However, that's not the problem.
3462120	3467220	What's going on here. Sony's pissed about this. And Sony is to the point where, um,
3467220	3472820	they are actually thinking about possibly filing a lawsuit. Apparently the agency who
3472820	3478880	made the ad, the gate, they did not get permission from Sony to use the controller, uh, in the
3478880	3485680	ad. And so it is possible that they're talking about, uh, uh, possibly Sony Computer Entertainment
3485680	3489720	Europe is considering legal action against the folks that made the ad.
3489720	3495040	And here's the thing, you know, yes, kids need to get up off the couch. Kids should
3495040	3501240	not sit and play video games all day. What's there to say that video games aren't actually
3501240	3506280	a healthy thing to incorporate into a lifestyle, you know, just, you know, maybe an hour a
3506280	3510800	day or a couple hours a week. You know, if you limit it in your kid's life, I don't think
3510800	3516000	it's necessarily such a bad thing at all. You know, right. Kind of gets them to think
3516000	3519840	it challenges them, gives them a sense of accomplishment. I think there's a lot of good
3519840	3524320	things, you know, the old hand-eye coordination riff that we all used growing up. Right. I
3524320	3528680	do still think though that kids need to go outside and play. Oh, I absolutely don't get
3528680	3535040	me wrong, but come on, look at this ad risk and early death sitting here playing. I'd
3535040	3536040	be pissed.
3536040	3540880	I'd be as uninteresting as this kid. They're also though not factoring in the fact that
3540880	3545440	there are many people who may be clinically overweight who are actually in better health
3545440	3552200	than, like say that you've got the person who's in their BMI range, correct? Right.
3552200	3559280	And they don't eat properly, they don't exercise, they can't lift much, but you've got the person
3559280	3564240	that maybe you say a little over their BMI, which by the way, BMI is bullshit, you know,
3564240	3570120	are overweight, but yet they go out and, you know, bike, go swimming, do things, are active
3570120	3575280	people and have much better cardiovascular system than the, you know, stupid little anorexic
3575280	3582320	cheerleader type. I mean, you can also have, you know, someone incredibly muscle bound
3582320	3589360	who's the same BMI as someone 300 pounds overweight. I mean, really, it's, you've got to look at
3589360	3596360	the factors of biology, genetics, and more than that. It's, just sitting in front of
3596360	3599600	the couch playing video games all day is not going to make you die.
3599600	3604520	Comments from chat. I have to read chat.orangelaundryradio.com. Xlink says, it's good hand-eye, but so is
3604520	3606360	masturbation. Good point.
3606360	3611640	SHJ100Matt says, go outside and play Dragon's Lair in the backyard. Xbandit says, you can
3611640	3616360	be fat and happy. It's true, you can be fat and happy, but you know, you just got to make
3616360	3619560	sure you're not fat and unhealthy. There's, there's the difference.
3619560	3625460	You know, so you can be a triathlete and, you know, or let's see, you can be a professional
3625460	3633840	bicyclist and get cancer. True. True. You can be a triathlete who gets hit by a car.
3633840	3639480	You know, what does it matter? Then you die an ironic death. Here's the thing is that
3639480	3644100	I think a better ad might be instead of the big text up there that says risk an early
3644100	3650440	death, do just nothing. How about one that says stop using games to babysit your children?
3650440	3654520	That would be an effective ad in my opinion. That, that would be one because the kid looks
3654520	3659280	bored and everything. So how about stop using games to babysit your children?
3659280	3666880	A responsible parent is going to look beyond, you know, there, and this is something that
3666880	3672280	I've had to think of a lot myself lately. If you're going to be a responsible parent,
3672280	3679640	you need to be 100% for your kid, including taking them outside to get them some activity,
3679640	3683880	including telling them, you know, I think you've played enough. You need to go do this
3683880	3689560	now. You've got to set, you know, the, uh, you have to do the things that are good for
3689560	3691880	them, not just the things that are convenient for you.
3691880	3694840	That's an awfully nice way to phrase it as a parent is that, you know, I think you've
3694840	3700760	played enough cause I know my mom would have said, turn it off and go outside.
3700760	3703320	Well, you know what I mean?
3703320	3705080	No, I know what you mean.
3705080	3709480	My mom would be just like, you're not on that thing again, are you? And then I'd go out
3709480	3713320	and play, come back and she'd be playing my Nintendo.
3713320	3719000	Nice. That's how she got her turn. Go outside. It's my turn.
3719000	3720440	That's pretty much it.
3720440	3723840	All right, so we'll see what happens. We'll see if Sony does end up suing over this or
3723840	3726680	not. I'm not sure what's going to end up happening.
3726680	3727680	You know who else will sue?
3727680	3728680	Who?
3728680	3735480	They won't, but speaking of Sony, we have some stuff about nobi nobi boy, um, Takahashi
3735480	3742720	Keita said that there's going to be an offline multiplayer mode on the way and that he wants
3742720	3749000	people to enjoy the game. So they're working on an update. Um, there's, uh, it's, it's
3749000	3756820	all going to be though offline though, specifically offline and, um, they're saying that it should
3756820	3758720	be roughly around the 18th of April.
3758720	3762000	Well, I mean, not boo. I mean, multiplayer is better than none at all, but you know,
3762000	3765960	I wish, you know, it's not like the Sony's not connected to the internet, you know?
3765960	3767660	I know, right?
3767660	3768660	So whatever.
3768660	3775500	Hmm. I don't know. I played that, like I said today, and I still don't get the game.
3775500	3778960	I have yet to check it out. I keep forgetting. And every time I do go on the PlayStation
3778960	3780760	to play, I'm going back to Flower.
3780760	3783680	I hate the camera so bad in the game.
3783680	3785480	The Sony camera? Oh, for Flower?
3785480	3794720	No, in No We Know You. The camera is a pain in the ass. And whatever. Um, so, it's interesting.
3794720	3799160	Um, of course, a lot of people are familiar with GamePro, the magazine. Um, it's still
3799160	3804420	around, surprisingly. Um, well, GamePro is actually going to publish indie games now
3804420	3809300	under their new label, GamePro Labs. And, uh, you may see some of these games coming
3809300	3818040	to XNA, PC, Zune, iPhone, etc. Um, basically, they're going to sort of act as a middleman
3818040	3820520	between indie devs and platform holders.
3820520	3824640	Um, what's also interesting is GamePro is going to announce that they're planning to
3824640	3831060	produce a free custom edition of its magazine for distribution exclusively at 7-Eleven.
3831060	3839100	So when you get your Slurpee, you can get a free copy of your modified GamePro magazine.
3839100	3842780	Is this going to be in addition to their print- the current subscription magazine?
3842780	3846100	Yes, and also, I'd like to add growing in this economy.
3846100	3851620	I'd like to add as a further dip at, um, the crap that is 7-Eleven. You can go pick up
3851620	3856460	your free magazine when you're picking up a game that's broken the street again, you
3856460	3857860	know, because 7-Eleven doesn't-
3857860	3859500	You make it sound like it's an issue.
3859500	3864560	7-Eleven doesn't hear street dates, nor do I.
3864560	3869020	I know, what's the problem? I thought you were in full support of this.
3869020	3873260	I'm in full support of Slurpees, and if- God damn it, if I became rich, I'm getting a
3873260	3874260	Slurpee machine.
3874260	3877940	I miss vanilla Coke Slurpees. Those were the bomb. What the hell do I have to do to get
3877940	3880860	those to come back?
3880860	3883780	GamePro doing their own game publishing. Do you think we're going to see anything big
3883780	3884780	come out of this?
3884780	3885780	Nope.
3885780	3888400	Or do you think it's just going to be of the caliber of the types of things that come free
3888400	3891140	with the magazine?
3891140	3895260	You know, that would be kind of interesting to have exclusive games for the magazine,
3895260	3897260	you know, just indie developers.
3897260	3900220	I know, I'm surprised these Xbox magazines aren't giving away some of these community
3900220	3903360	games on their discs.
3903360	3908740	That's because they have to give away demos that are already available on Live. Woo! Demos!
3908740	3909740	I can't download-
3909740	3911740	For those three people that are connected to the internet.
3911740	3916140	See, here's the thing. I used to subscribe to Xbox Magazine back when they used to have
3916140	3920180	demos, way before they ever came out, you know, like Saints Row, because that was awesome.
3920180	3927220	Saints Row demo, hell yeah, but now it's like demos for old shit that have been out on Live
3927220	3928780	for a long time now.
3928780	3932300	Yeah, no thanks, I don't need to subscribe to your magazine anymore. I already get a
3932300	3938780	free membership to stupid, well not even technically free, but I get a membership to Game Informer
3938780	3942980	because I have that stupid card at GameStop because, you know, it gives me an extra 10%
3942980	3943980	or whatever.
3943980	3947820	Who cares? It's paid for itself, but hey, I get a magazine out of it, and actually the
3947820	3951700	magazine's not bad, so I'm not buying Xbox Magazine.
3951700	3956780	Well, if you've ever wanted to make your own iPhone game, as a lot of people have been
3956780	3960900	lately, I think the iPhone passed some obscene amount of applications that are now available
3960900	3963660	in the store, like 10,000 apps or something are now available in the store.
3963660	3964940	How many of them are good?
3964940	3969620	Probably 10. But anyhow, here's the thing, is that now any idiot's going to be able to
3969620	3975980	make their own iPhone game. It's a game called GameSalad. Yes, that's right, it's GameSalad,
3975980	3980020	it's this new software that's coming out from Gendai Games. It's going to be something that
3980020	3982900	will help you develop your own iPhone games.
3982900	3985700	Apparently though, it's not just going to stop there. I guess in the future, what have
3985700	3991540	you, it's going to be open to Facebook, and then possibly the Wii and the DS someday.
3991540	3995440	So yeah, GameSalad is coming out of this, I guess they were showing more about this
3995440	4000020	at the South by Southwest festival that's going on right now this weekend. Kind of interesting,
4000020	4003180	you make your own little 2D games, these screenshots I'm looking at, somebody's putting together
4003180	4006420	their own little shooter game. I don't know though, is this just going to be the quality
4006420	4009340	of RPG Maker, or what? I don't know.
4009340	4015700	Don't knock RPG Maker, it's still pretty good actually. But no, it's not going to be any
4015700	4022160	good at all. I mean, RPG Maker's pretty awesome, but I've seen some of these games, like how
4022160	4028500	like Click and Play, there's just so many limitations to it, and I don't know, I think
4028500	4029500	it's just-
4029500	4032040	Well, here's the thing though, it's not just for shooters, like some of the games they
4032040	4035420	say have been made on this that are pretty good. A game called Darkwood that's like a
4035420	4043660	Zelda-ish type of RPG that was made by 3 students in a week's time, and then DRFT, a 2D racing
4043660	4045780	game that's kind of like the original Grand Theft Auto.
4045780	4049460	Yeah, it sounds like everything that Click and Play could have done, because that's the
4049460	4054000	type of stuff you could do in it, and it's just very limited, and yeah, you can make
4054000	4058620	these wonderful little racing games and stuff, but they're just not great. And I hope to
4058620	4063140	God that you can't publish these on the Apple Store, because that's all they want. Let's
4063140	4067340	put out a game-making program so any idiot can create all this crap and then we can pad
4067340	4072540	our numbers on the App Store and use that in our next commercial that, you know-
4072540	4077060	Why not? Any idiot can make a podcast and get it listed on the iTunes Store. Hey, how
4077060	4078060	you doing?
4078060	4084340	Yeah, but iTunes doesn't go, hey, we've got X million podcasts, look at us, we're so awesome.
4084340	4087300	They don't really care.
4087300	4090660	Apple doesn't care about podcasts?
4090660	4095460	Apple doesn't care about a lot of things except getting you to buy their crappy products.
4095460	4100380	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news. We're almost to the end of part A of
4100380	4102620	the Classic Game of the Week, coming up in just a little bit, we've got a couple more
4102620	4104020	stories for you guys.
4104020	4111580	That we do. In fact, something about Resident Evil 5. There's supposed to be a versus download
4111580	4124340	content and it's supposed to be out for 160 Microsoft points or 250 yen on a Playstation
4124340	4130260	network, which we're probably going to be getting it for twice as much or something
4130260	4137980	like that, but they're basically saying in Japan it's going to be out March 26th, so.
4137980	4146220	Very cool. So there's, of course, we were talking a little bit earlier about exclusives
4146220	4152260	and that kind of stuff and mentioned Bioshock 2. Well, of course, this month in Game Informer,
4152260	4158300	which also goes back to another story, man, we're transitioning from two different stories.
4158300	4166020	Bioshock 2 was the cover story and, of course, they showed, or revealed, I should say, the
4166020	4174100	Big Sister is a new Big Daddy-esque creature that you're going to be fighting against in
4174100	4179340	the game. Now, there are no real details, at least, that have leaked out yet about what
4179340	4185700	exactly you're going to be doing, but the second game, apparently, you will be playing
4185700	4191660	as the first Big Daddy, the original. They'll be kind of a renegade Big Daddy that's actually
4191660	4197900	on the hunt for his own little sister and that you'll be able to take out rival daddies
4197900	4203620	with your hand drill. Plasmid powers, apparently, are going to be making a return as well as
4203620	4210380	some other interesting things. And, apparently, this little sister is looking to kidnap your
4210380	4216500	little sisters as well. And it's very interesting, but, of course, it's going to be an awesome
4216500	4227900	game. Bioshock 1 was really sweet and I can't see that it's going to be any less than that.
4227900	4231300	This game has an awful lot to live up to. Do you think it's going to meet the hype?
4231300	4234220	I think it will. I think they're going to have to do some interesting stuff with it.
4234220	4237740	I thought that it was going to be more above ground and stuff like that. The fact that
4237740	4243420	you're playing as a Big Daddy from the beginning is kind of ehhh. I'm not too sure if I like
4243420	4252460	that idea, but we'll see. Alright, well, hey, let's take a trip back to the past here. I'm
4252460	4255740	not talking about the Classic Game of the Week just yet, but here's the interesting
4255740	4259940	thing is that the Genesis, of course, is a system that's been featured many times in
4259940	4266100	the Classic Game of the Week. Apparently, there is this new kind of like third party
4266100	4271860	Sega Genesis coming out here. Blaze is the company that is producing this. I guess it's
4271860	4275780	kind of like a knockoff of the Genesis that came out kind of later. They're calling it
4275780	4278500	the Mega Drive because I don't think they're actually releasing it here. It's something
4278500	4285700	that is being sold at Play in Britain. It's going for about $53 and with the system comes
4285700	4292240	about 15 games. Sonic and Knuckles, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd, Golden Axe. So all these
4292240	4296960	old school games. And I guess what you start to see is as these consoles age, I guess the
4296960	4302180	patents expire or something like that. And now third party remake these old ass consoles,
4302180	4305700	which is interesting. And the best part about this though, because they did release something
4305700	4308780	before they've done handhelds and that kind of thing. The best part about this though
4308780	4314740	is it does have its own cartridge slot that will play Mega Drive and Genesis games. So
4314740	4318660	not only do you have the 15 that are built in, but you can put in new ones. Yeah. Very
4318660	4324680	cool. Very cool. Alright, well, now what we're going to do, we're going to take a trip back
4324680	4328420	to the past and I don't know if Dark Soccer has picked a Genesis game this week. She might
4328420	4333820	have picked something else. Not a while. Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane and see
4333820	4338460	what the classic game of the week is that all you kids should check out this week by
4338460	4347460	Dark Soccer. Well, the secret, the secret. The game of the week is Secret of Mana, which
4347460	4355900	was known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2. And I picked music for it that is actually some
4355900	4366900	of the overworld music, which is my favorite. Well, I thought it was going to be a little
4366900	4383460	different. The game came out, it was actually developed by Square, which is now Squeenix,
4383460	4391180	and came out on the Super Nintendo and we eventually got it on Virtual Console. It's
4391180	4396420	actually, as I said, Seiken Densetsu 2. The first one was called Seiken Densetsu Final
4396420	4405180	Fantasy Gaiden for the Game Boy, and we got it as Final Fantasy Adventure. It was kind
4405180	4411060	of an interesting little game there, but going back to Secret of Mana, it didn't use the
4411060	4419220	turn based system, it used a real time battle, more like how it was in Zelda, but you also
4419220	4427700	had an AI that you could actually control to be either attacking, defense, or somewhere
4427700	4433660	in the middle, and a second player could come in and play one of your other characters.
4433660	4439820	So it was pretty much a two player RPG. I personally have not tried to do it with the
4439820	4445300	multitap to see if you can do three people, so if anyone has let me know. It just never
4445300	4458740	occurred to me until I was an adult. So the game itself, in the American version, is basically,
4458740	4464060	you're kicked out of town and you have to go and you hook up with a princess and a sprite
4464060	4471320	and you run around trying to get a different, well first of all you get your experience
4471320	4479420	in battle and you level up and you can level up your spells as you, you know, as you attract
4479420	4484140	them. And by the way, the multitap does work. Thought I would mention that. And the virtual
4484140	4489800	console version will let you use three people. But anyway, you have to rescue different elementals
4489800	4497780	and they give you different attacks, different skills, different things that you can do.
4497780	4508620	But the magic is your party's mana power which will increase as the game goes on. So, really
4508620	4515020	it's just you go through different places. You can also get Flammie. You remember Flammie?
4515020	4518940	Yes. The second thing I put on there, Rob, was
4518940	4522260	Flammie's music. Let me queue that up here real quick.
4522260	4536580	The best way I can describe Flammie is like Falcor from The Never Ending Story, really.
4536580	4541940	It's the same concept. You ride on this big white dragon thingy's back and then you can
4541940	4552300	land in different places. But hey, it's mode seven-tastic. So you can go over the background
4552300	4557900	and you can move and the map will move with you and you can land and it's pretty cool.
4557900	4562580	So it's just a cool little game. I think it's funny though, the way that you call them is
4562580	4569860	by doing the little drum with the balls on the string. I forgot what they're called.
4569860	4579620	But anyway, it's super cool. But at the end you get the mana sword and kick ass and game
4579620	4595300	over. So the game was designed by Ishikoichi and was actually released after Final Fantasy
4595300	4604500	3. They wanted to actually use the system from Final Fantasy 4, but it wouldn't work
4604500	4609180	in the series, so they did it all for Secret of Mana. It was originally going to be an
4609180	4615740	SNES CD add-on, but when they dropped that they just did it all to fit on the cartridge.
4615740	4624660	I actually had one of the faster localization. It only took 30 days to translate the game.
4624660	4635580	And we got it. It was also stated that they were going to bring it out for the Wonderswan
4635580	4649580	Color and they cancelled it when Square decided to tell Bondi WTF, we don't like you anymore.
4649580	4655780	So that's really it. It's been one of the most popular games. It's been considered by
4655780	4662540	Nintendo Power it was number 42 in their top 200 games of all time. And it's one of my
4662540	4667500	favorites. And it's actually because of this that I went nuts trying to find Saikens and
4667500	4680220	Senzu 3 and played the most of it on a fully translated bomb hack. I wish I could find it.
4680220	4682220	It's a very worthwhile game. If you haven't played it, play the hell out of it and then
4682220	4691180	play Saikens and Senzu 3 because it just evolves all the awesome. So go for it. I don't even
4691180	4693580	know why I hadn't reviewed this earlier.
4693580	4697980	Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Secret of Mana. And what a classic
4697980	4702100	game it is. I wonder if they'll ever be highlighting Secret of Evermore.
4702100	4708060	Well, ow, sorry. You know what gave me the idea to do that, Rob? I found my game.
4708060	4709060	What's that?
4709060	4710060	Secret of Mana.
4710060	4711060	Oh, did you?
4711060	4712060	In the box.
4712060	4713060	Ah.
4713060	4716940	With the instruction manual and everything. And then I was just thinking, damn. It's a
4716940	4719500	shame that I'm so attached to this thing.
4719500	4720500	Nice.
4720500	4721940	That would pay for my Disneyland.
4721940	4727100	Right, right. Alright, well we are going to take a break here. We've got plenty more Orange
4727100	4730740	Lounge Radio coming up, though, in Orange Lounge Radio Part B. So stay tuned. Don't
4730740	4738940	go anywhere. We will be right back.
4738940	4742740	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March
4742740	4750140	15th of 2009, where we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night on AllGames.com. All Games
4750140	4754300	Radio, bringing you lots and lots of great gaming shows throughout the week. We're on
4754300	4757620	right after another great gaming show called The Bobby Black Wolf Show, and we run for
4757620	4762700	about three hours, until we're tired and we want to go home, is basically how long we
4762700	4763900	do the show.
4763900	4767060	We have plenty more gaming news to get to in this segment. First, though, I want to
4767060	4770460	kind of give a plug for this. You might remember a few weeks ago, actually it was a couple
4770460	4776780	months ago now at this point, we had Aaron from the Snake 360 development team, or he
4776780	4782100	is the Snake 360 development team, really, all by his little self, was here on the show
4782100	4786100	to talk about his community game, Snake 360. Well, I just got word that now apparently
4786100	4793680	there is a new game called Snake 360 Lite on Xbox Live Marketplace, and it's the same
4793680	4798420	game as pretty much what was up there before, except now it's half the price. Now, of course,
4798420	4801740	since it is half the price, there's a little less features than what you have in the full
4801740	4807660	game, but now I guess you get some two different multiplayer modes now, three single player
4807660	4813420	courses, three difficulty levels, multiples of control schemes, just like in the other
4813420	4817420	game, you still get some of the soundtrack from the same recording, and so on and so
4817420	4822620	on. So, pretty cool, check that out, support independent game development, Snake 360 Lite.
4822620	4826460	Alright, now we're going to get back into some other gaming news, yes, Loki?
4826460	4834580	Yes, we are. Some pretty cool stuff, I don't know, this is kind of weird. Nintendo has
4834580	4840700	addressed complaints that they had not that many games coming out, they're low output
4840700	4846660	of first party titles. Apparently, it says this year, Nintendo seems to be getting some
4846660	4854700	more games coming out, including the equally awaited Punch Out. Of course, they've been
4854700	4858380	having the new play control games and stuff like that, but it says until now, there have
4858380	4863420	been complaints that Nintendo actually makes too many games, or Nintendo dictates too much
4863420	4868940	leadership. I think they're talking about publishers complaining that their games, the
4868940	4873260	first party games seem to be so successful, it's actually overshadowing the third party
4873260	4878300	games, and then also it says that there's also people complaining that Nintendo makes
4878300	4885260	far too few games. And they're like, well, we don't know what to do. So now that they're
4885260	4888820	putting out more games, they're trying to make sure people are going to be happy. The
4888820	4895020	thing though, you ask me, they're not really putting out that many new games. I mean, porting
4895020	4900540	over a game that was on the GameCube that they had sitting in a shelf for quite a long
4900540	4907540	time, some of the Mario Tennis and the Pikmin games and the new Donkey Kong, was it Jungle
4907540	4911900	Beat and that kind of stuff. Those aren't new games. You're just adding stuff to it
4911900	4917020	and you're adding new controls to it. I mean, really, that does not count. Putting old things
4917020	4922860	in new packaging. That doesn't count at all. Excite Bots and Punch Out, that does count
4922860	4927420	because those are brand new. But these new play control games, I'm sorry, I'm getting
4927420	4931740	a little sick of them. And they've just started coming out, but just tell people to stop buying
4931740	4936460	them. But the thing is, that's all that's coming out now. It's like, people are so hungry
4936460	4940860	for Nintendo games, like, oh god, I want a new Pikmin game. Well, now you're going to
4940860	4946140	buy the re-release of Pikmin 1 and 2. I mean, that's fine if you want to play them or if
4946140	4951180	you haven't played them before, but it's kind of encouraging them not to put any effort
4951180	4955100	into it. It's just like, I don't know if you remember back on the Game Boy Advance, when
4955100	4960940	they started porting NES games to it. You know, that was cool, but at the same time,
4960940	4968660	it's like, let's make something new now. Anytime now. GameGuru in our chatroom says Punch Out
4968660	4975180	is very much a remake. It is, but it is adding new characters, and it's not so much, it may
4975180	4980080	be a remake, but it's not a port. It's a Super Nintendo game too, and it's at least kind
4980080	4984020	of redone from the ground up, and there are some new things in it. And it's not a port.
4984020	4988500	It's not like, oh, I took the GameCube game, didn't really change anything to it, and then
4988500	4994380	just poured it over. Now, Pikmin 1 and Mario Power Tennis, they didn't really add anything
4994380	4998860	to it. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, from what I hear, they're adding some additional levels
4998860	5002420	to it. I don't know if it was in the Japanese version or if these are brand new levels,
5002420	5006020	but they're adding something to it. And then Pikmin 2 are supposed to have two different
5006020	5010140	types of Pikmin that weren't originally in the game. So they are adding something to
5010140	5018820	it. But still, it's a port of a game that's been out for a long time now. GS68 in chat
5018820	5024660	asks, where's my new play control Custer's Revenge? That wasn't on the GameCube. It wasn't,
5024660	5028700	but maybe it's a game that he's thinking needs to make a comeback, I don't know. Alright,
5028700	5033180	well look, if you want to look for some new Wii games that actually look kind of interesting,
5033180	5036700	and you want to talk about a remake, I don't know if this is really a remake though. This
5036700	5041060	is like a reinvention completely of the old game Pong. I'm going to actually play a little
5041060	5046060	clip here from the little trailer that we have here in studio, because this actually
5046060	5055380	looks kind of neat. Let me see if I can play a little clip here. It's like a music-based
5055380	5063900	game. It's called Bit.Trip.Beat, and it's by a company called Axis. And it's actually
5063900	5068380	coming out to WiiWare on Monday, and it's like, all these little Pong balls consistently
5068380	5071740	are coming at your little paddle, and you have to bounce them back. And when you do,
5071740	5077340	it makes little beat music, like the 8-bit weapon type of chiptunes music, that's what
5077340	5081340	I was looking for. I guess this game's coming out, it's going to be 600 points. Here's the
5081340	5084860	thing, the controls, you just tilt the control back and forth, tilt the little Wiimote back
5084860	5088800	and forth to make the little paddle go up and down the screen. And the graphics, they're
5088800	5095300	not even 8-bit, they're like Atari 2600, but with these really trippy New Age backgrounds.
5095300	5099260	So it looks kind of neat. I'm actually thinking I have to play this. This should be on the
5099260	5104540	DS. No, I like the idea of only having to pay $6 for this. But this should be on the
5104540	5110220	DS. Who knows, maybe if this does well, it will be. But like, this boss stage looks just
5110220	5116100	like a freakin' regular Breakout or something like that, it's crazy. Trippy. Very trippy.
5116100	5120980	Hence the name, haha. Exactly, so you can check that out, it'll be out on WiiWare on
5120980	5125140	Monday it sounds like. By the time most of you hear this podcast, it'll already be out.
5125140	5132140	ActDeft in chat says, BitTripBeat is basically Pong and Rez's bastard child. Kinda. Kinda.
5132140	5142260	Well, I have bad, bad news. Actually, not really bad news. Hmm, what's that? It's not
5142260	5150620	likely news, but Capcom US is hoping that we get a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which I think
5150620	5159300	would be freakin' fantastic. And I mean, it's got Gatchamon. What else do you need, right?
5159300	5164460	They're saying, it was basically a quote by Christian Svensson, who is the developer,
5164460	5169180	the business developer and strategic planning VP at Capcom, said, do not rule out, do not
5169180	5173300	rule a Western release out. That's all I can say right now. We are still actively working
5173300	5177300	on having that happening. I can't say it's happening definitely. I couldn't give you
5177300	5181580	a time, but as badly as the fans want it, we want to bring it. The problem that they're
5181580	5190900	running into is, what do we all say, licensing. Right? Mm-hmm. Tatsunoko rights are actually
5190900	5197380	split among several companies in the US, whereas of course in Japan, Tatsunoko Pro has all
5197380	5204300	of them. You don't have to worry about it. But here, it's like, you know, whoever had,
5204300	5209340	you know, Gatchamon 2 has Eagle Riders here. You know, there was Battle of the Planets,
5209340	5217500	there was G-Force, you know, for all the Gatchamon franchises. I don't know if we ever got Tekkaban
5217500	5223540	on TV here at all. Some anime companies got the rights to Kachan. Yeah, we had it as it
5223540	5229180	was Technoman over here. But just all those different characters, the ones that were either
5229180	5235580	converted to, you know, tunes that we watched as a kid or in later anime, you know, home
5235580	5241060	releases, you know, different things like that. Or even, you know, people who just thought
5241060	5246580	about bringing it out over here and paid the licensing rights. That does happen. It's gonna
5246580	5252700	be a pain to get everything together, so they're actually gonna have to do a lot of work for
5252700	5259820	us to get the game over here, and it's all down to freakin' licensing. Well, that's not
5259820	5263020	a surprise, but kinda, you know, I think we all, at least I accepted the fact that we
5263020	5266400	probably weren't gonna be getting this game quite some time ago. You know, I wouldn't
5266400	5271480	expect to see this game over here because of the licensing, which is just a darn shame
5271480	5275400	because the game's a lot of fun. You almost just kinda wish, you know, if the Japanese
5275400	5280340	companies created them, they just would release it out here and say, fuck all y'all. These
5280340	5284900	were originally our characters, so I forget it. But I guess, sadly, in a sue-happy world,
5284900	5290100	that's not what can be done. Well, the way that it is is that once Tatsunoko's given
5290100	5295100	up the rights, they have to abide by contract. Yeah, no, I get it. It just sucks. And Tatsunoko
5295100	5301140	Pro I don't think really has any holdings in the US, so it'd be nice. So then they couldn't
5301140	5305500	be sued in a US court. But I guess Capcom could be. But Tatsunoko wouldn't legally be
5305500	5310300	able to give the approval, which they clearly did in Japan, they just would not legally
5310300	5314700	be able to do approval in the United States. No, I know, I get it. It just sucks. That's
5314700	5320600	all. It just sucks. Hmm. So. It's still pretty cool though that might have a chance to actually
5320600	5325240	come out over here. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't bet money on it. Here's what I would
5325240	5329220	bet. If anything, they would just use the engine for something else. You know, like
5329220	5335380	port, new maybe Capcom vs Street Fighter game. That'd be kinda cool, you know, with some
5335380	5341100	new Capcom characters in there and stuff. You know, get a, what's his name, Frank West
5341100	5347140	from Dead Rising in there and stuff as a character. Sadly, I'm not gonna hold my breath. They'd
5347140	5352740	need Gatchaman Fighter. Always. Just Gatchaman. Whatever. And they'd need to make it, for
5352740	5358060	me specifically, and say, because Jamie demanded it, we give you- And it would actually say
5358060	5365820	that in the opening credits. Exactly. We give you Gatchaman the battle. Okay. I would be
5365820	5372580	very gratified as a fangirl. And then you wake up. Yeah, not gonna happen. What is gonna
5372580	5379220	happen though are three more Wii games in the Resident Evil series, including the, it's
5379220	5384940	never gonna be released in the United States, Resident Evil 0, which now is gonna be released
5384940	5390180	in the United States, and of course already out in Japan. However, a new game that will
5390180	5395380	be coming out, Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles, which will be a sequel to the Umbrella Chronicles
5395380	5400660	game. It's gonna be a rail shooter, and is based on the Resident Evil 2 timeline starring
5400660	5407300	Leon and Claire. They're gonna add, I guess, some new co-op stuff and a new evade system,
5407300	5412100	which is supposed to be pretty cool. Then they're also gonna do a Resident Evil remake
5412100	5419340	that's gonna be coming out as well, titled, I guess, Resident Evil Classics. And, not
5419340	5424100	sure if that's gonna be kinda like a new play control game or something like that, but that's
5424100	5439740	gonna be, I guess, coming out for a $30 price point. The studio is haunted. We're having
5439740	5452100	the attack of the random beeping noise. Here, just give that to me. I'll turn that off.
5452100	5457220	Live radio, everybody. It's my sensor bar. Batteries are going out. Sorry about that,
5457220	5460660	guys. It's warning you that it's turning off. We had random beeping going on in the studio,
5460660	5463980	and it was from the Wii that Loki was playing during the breaks there, showing Madworld
5463980	5468420	on Justintv. The wireless bar was beeping. That was crazy. I think the timer, I had set
5468420	5474780	it to a two-hour timer, so I think it was turning off. Okay, sorry about the crazy dead
5474780	5481460	air there, but live radio, that happens. Yeah, so I'm sorry. Resident Evil rail shooter is
5481460	5485860	coming out. And it makes me think about, you know, Silent Hill had a rail shooter that
5485860	5489100	hit arcades and what have you, so it's like all these scary games are getting shooters.
5489100	5492660	You know what scary thing I wanna see get turned into a shooter, though? Hot girls in
5492660	5497740	scary places. Have you seen this show on E? I thought you were gonna say showgirls. No.
5497740	5501940	That is scary in itself, but have you seen this on E? It's a show on E, and they put
5501940	5505220	hot girls and they put them in scary places, and they have to spend the night in abandoned
5505220	5509740	hospitals and stuff. What, like, you know, next to nerdy guys or something? No, they
5509740	5512780	have to do all these gross tasks and they get money and stuff like that, you know, if
5512780	5517040	they're able to actually... Hot girls in scary places, yes. That's the game they need that's
5517040	5523700	a rail shooter of a completely different kind. Alright. Anyhow, forget it. Moving on. More
5523700	5528700	news on Excitebots. It seems like every week we have new news on Excitebots, but here's
5528700	5534160	the interesting thing about Excitebots. Apparently now the blogs are reporting that Super Sandwich
5534160	5538740	is a move that you can have in the game, and that's from this giant screenshot coming from
5538740	5544180	the game there. Super Sandwich, five stars. It's basically, what they've done is they've
5544180	5548500	have a bunch of different things that are going on during the races, like, you know,
5548500	5551660	you'll have to collect parts of a sandwich and then when you collect them you have Super
5551660	5555500	Sandwich. You know, it was funny, remember? I don't know if you remember when Christopher
5555500	5559420	used to, like, kind of sing the different, like, achievements that he got in there. He
5559420	5563980	was like, Super Tree Run! So that's what I pictured when I saw that. I was, like, picturing
5563980	5568340	him singing Super Sandwich. Nice. Which would be funny. Sadly you will not be having an
5568340	5573220	actual sandwich, which is most unfortunate if you ask me. The game looks crazy and Nelly
5573220	5578300	keeps asking me why it's coming out, so. And we don't know, right? Or is it... Uh, 20.
5578300	5585300	22nd or 20th of April? Yeah. Oh. Alright. Not too far out. Not too far out. Hey, it's
5585300	5590780	in time for a birthday present. For me! It's always got to be about you now, doesn't it?
5590780	5599780	Yes, it always must be about me. I have to have the show's ego after all. Anyway, um,
5599780	5612260	how about something related to Namco, maybe? Okay. Well, Namco is actually registered Excalibur
5612260	5620860	as a trademark. They're not really saying much about it, but it actually has an ESRB
5620860	5629820	listing some achievements revealed. The, like I said, the registered trademark. And so it's
5629820	5636780	there. Namco Bandai is releasing Excalibur. So, of course the theory is that, you know,
5636780	5644300	it's about King Arthur, but maybe it's another in the Soulcalibur family? Or maybe a fighting
5644300	5656100	game using the same engine? Or a remake of that old game Excalibur 2555 AD? I have a
5656100	5662300	feeling that whatever it is, it's going to be lame and disappointing. It's going to be
5662300	5666860	about Pac-Man! Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. No, that's Namco for you. It's either going
5666860	5672700	to be really awesome or really lame. And it's usually nothing in between, so. I'm voting
5672700	5678460	really lame. I don't know. Without a screenshot, nothing? I mean, this could be anything. It
5678460	5685180	could be a role-playing game. Who knows? Nothing. It sounds a little bit like Soulcalibur, but
5685180	5690340	you know, Excalibur is also an old, you know, legend and all that stuff. It may have nothing
5690340	5696020	to do with Soulcalibur. Excalibur is the storyline based on fighters that have dropped out of
5696020	5701620	the Soulcalibur series and now have to find real daytime jobs, including working faster
5701620	5710740	at restaurants. I get it. Excalibur. Ha ha. You're funny. What a fun guy. Ha ha ha. Or,
5710740	5717900	or it's a fighting game featuring all the exes in the relationship. Alright, I think
5717900	5724340	now's a good time to just go to the next story. I'll stop now. We do know what this game is
5724340	5729620	though. We Rock Drum King. It's a brand new drumming game for the Wii. Of course, not
5729620	5734220	using any actual peripherals other than the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, or possibly two remotes
5734220	5739060	if you have those. What it does have though is a pretty cool song list. And the track
5739060	5746140	list was revealed this week, including some stuff that you would not normally see in a
5746140	5751940	music game like this. Now of course you've got classic rock songs like We Will Rock You
5751940	5757420	by Queen, The Final Countdown by Europe. You've got some kind of alternative stuff,
5757420	5763100	Song 2 by Blur. Then some other stuff that they've thrown in there as well. Feel Good
5763100	5772040	Ink by Gorillaz. But one of the weird ones though that was in there, they had Organ Donor,
5772040	5776360	the instrumental version by DJ Shadow. You normally wouldn't see that kind of in like
5776360	5781980	a rock game like this. Some other songs that are in there as well. They have All Star by
5781980	5790540	Smash Mouth. No One Knows by the Queens of the Stone Age. The Takeover, The Break's Over
5790540	5799900	by Fall Out Boy. Can't Stand Losing You by the Police. Spoon Man by Soundgarden. And
5799900	5810260	Click Click Boom by Saliva, as featured in numerous movie trailers. You know, I was still
5810260	5813600	tempted to get Rock Revolution this week. It's only 20 bucks. There's tons of them sitting
5813600	5818660	on the shelf. I'm almost thinking it's going to drop to $9.99 before too long. It won't
5818660	5824380	drop officially to $9.99, but just let's sit there and fester a while and it's eventually
5824380	5831140	going to drop down. So bad, they actually cancelled the Wii version. Ouch. Ouch. Because
5831140	5836380	that was actually supposedly slated for April, still coming out at $50 retail. I'm like,
5836380	5841620	yeah, no one's gonna buy that. Wow. So, yeah, they just cancelled it. Wow. I wonder if there's
5841620	5846700	sales figures on how much that game actually sold. Oh, I'm sure there are. In fact, I have
5846700	5850820	an idea where to look. Alright, well, while you do that, let me talk about some other
5850820	5855580	games that aren't necessarily just there to be sold. It's actually kind of neat. This
5855580	5859900	is over in Japan. There's a Nintendo game seminar program, and if you're a student of
5859900	5863800	this, you get to make your own DS game, basically, as a part of the program. Well, Nintendo's
5863800	5868380	actually taken these games that were created, and now they're available at DS download stations
5868380	5873340	throughout Japan. And you can also get them through the Wii Nintendo channel. There's
5873340	5877500	four games available. One of them is a mic controlled game in which you blow to kind
5877500	5882780	of create air that sends stars up in the sky. Another one is where you are a voice artist
5882780	5887920	that reads lines, and then when they're played back, they're given by like a weird character
5887920	5893180	on screen, a random one or something. Another one is an action game where you move around
5893180	5897380	and you pose, but I'm not sure exactly how that's done because they didn't say these
5897380	5902700	were for the DSi, although, you know, I'm sure these will show up on the DSi, you know,
5902700	5905880	eventually. Sure, if they can charge like two bucks for them, why not? And then the
5905880	5911620	last one is a game about making faces. You shape weird things on these heads that don't
5911620	5915860	have bodies and etc. So, but it's just kind of cool, you know, despite the fact that the
5915860	5919780	games all sound like little one-trick ponies, it's kind of cool that, you know, they have
5919780	5924740	this program where students can make these games over in Japan and, you know, not just
5924740	5927540	that, but now they have kind of a way to get it out there. It's almost kind of like a little
5927540	5932860	bit XNA-ish, so I don't know if that's something maybe this is a sign that Nintendo might use
5932860	5936960	the DSi download service for this or some of their other distribution channels, but
5936960	5943020	that is kind of an interesting thought, right? Yeah, although it could just be a bunch of
5943020	5949400	crapware, I don't know. Okay, I've got the sales figures on Rock Revolution. Alright,
5949400	5956820	can you source them or...? Yes, these are coming from VGcharts.com, and this is up-to-date
5956820	5960740	sales figures. Although they have sales figures for Wii version of Rock Revolution, I guess
5960740	5970180	it never came out over here, but whatever. 0.5 million copies were sold for the Xbox
5970180	5976460	360 version. That is the highest of the three. That's not bad, that's a half million, right?
5976460	5985540	0.5 million, or 0.05? 0.05 million. Oh, so 50,000. 50,000. And that is the best one out
5985540	5994140	of all three versions. The PS3 version sold 0.02 million copies, or 20,000, and then finally
5994140	6001900	the DS version only sold 10,000 copies. Youch. Well, that's sad because the DS version seemed
6001900	6006500	like the only one that made sense out of the bunch. But whatever. Alright, well thanks
6006500	6009340	for looking that up for me. Alright, well, now we're going to get to the part of the
6009340	6014340	show where you can always send us some questions and have them answered here live on air. It's
6014340	6018940	the mailbag segment every week you guys send us emails. Mailbag at orangelauncher.com and
6018940	6022460	we read our favorites live on air and respond to them. DarkSira, did we actually get some
6022460	6025900	emails this week? I know you had to clean out the spam. Amongst the spam, yeah, really.
6025900	6035740	Um, we got one from Cheeseburger. Aight. Dongle. It made me giggle. Smack. Inside, in a painful
6035740	6044380	way. Did we get any emails of substance? Yes. Alright. Um, first of all, this is, it says
6044380	6050860	Dear Sea Wow and Wow Bar and Dark Sakura Sky and Loki. So this is a multiple email. First,
6050860	6057980	where, um, are my shows and, two, boy do I have a slew of reviews for you. Okay. Alright,
6057980	6062060	first, um, Tony Hawk's Project 8, another Tony Hawk title for the PSP, but this time
6062060	6069260	around it is a bit more challenging. No auto-kick. The story is cheesy as always. But anyways
6069260	6077220	it's awesome and if you are a skater, wanna be by this. I'm sorry I really can't read
6077220	6083660	this. Yeah, I'm looking at this, it looks like it was written on a PSP. I'm going to
6083660	6092380	try. Alright. Okay, I'm, I'm going to translate into English, okay? Will that be fine? Okay,
6092380	6099100	Wipeout Pure. A lot of us, uh, kids who own a DS and own a GBA, um, know of F-Zero and
6099100	6105460	GX. They have not released anything for a long time and I own a PSP. I thought that
6105460	6109940	it would be a good idea. Instead, it was, and I'll tell you it was more of a challenge
6109940	6116100	than F-Zero. GTA Liberty City, okay. I know you're thinking what a 15 year old is doing
6116100	6121700	with a GTA game. I bought it on Amazon using my debit card and got it a few weeks. I popped
6121700	6126300	it in and I instantly love it. The custom soundtrack stuff takes some work, but once
6126300	6130980	you do it, it's awesome. Killing police from my safe house with a sniper rifle and racking
6130980	6137200	up a six star rating is so fun. Definitely recommend it to a first time PSP buyer. Lords
6137200	6141920	of Dogtown, I love skateboarding and surfing stuff. This movie combined a little bit of
6141920	6149020	both with a story about Jay Adams, Tony Alva, and Stacy Peralta. Okay. Um, alright, last
6149020	6153200	thing. I have one question. Have you guys ever heard of Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment
6153200	6157500	System or the Neo Geo CD King of Fighters is Better Than Street Fighter? Peace out,
6157500	6164540	DS lover. Okay. First of all, I own, um, a Neo Geo and I, um, I have a Neo Geo CD as
6164540	6172100	well and I have, um, a Neo Geo pocket color and a Neo Geo pocket. Um, so I'm really not
6172100	6180400	sure which one you're asking about, but King of Fighters, um, it really depends on what
6180400	6184460	you're into. I love the King of Fighters series. I mean, talk about your cheap bitches and
6184460	6189060	hard to pull off attacks. I mean, Street Fighter's a little bit more gratifying to play, but
6189060	6193500	King of Fighters is just a little bit more, sometimes there's a bit more of a fun factor
6193500	6197580	involved with the King of Fighters games. And I do have to say that if you've got it
6197580	6203420	on the Neo Geo, you've got it arcade perfect and you have also paid for it. So that's all
6203420	6209640	I can say about that. Rob? Um, you know, yeah, King of Fighters is sort of like an evolution
6209640	6215100	of, uh, Fatal Fury and King, um, Art of Fighting in those games. And it's, it's okay. Like
6215100	6219540	it's not something I really can usually tolerate long-term though, the SNK games, but they
6219540	6222740	do have that whole, like, you know, foreground and background thing, which is kind of what
6222740	6227240	made them famous. But, um, that was just, um, Fatal Fury. I don't, oh, was it just Fatal
6227240	6232060	Fury? I thought King of Fighters had it too. My bad. Did Art of Fighting have it? No, I
6232060	6234980	think just Fatal Fury. No, Art of Fighting had the weird zoom in and out thing. That
6234980	6240540	was our fighting did it too. The first one did at least. So it was Fatal Fury that had
6240540	6245660	the background foreground. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, it's, it's, it's different and worth
6245660	6250260	the play, but it, I don't think it's necessarily better. Does that make sense? But I love Capcom
6250260	6254940	versus SNK. That's one of my favorite fighters right there. So Matt, what's your preference
6254940	6260020	Street Fighter or King of Fighting? King of Fighters. Do you have a preference, Loki?
6260020	6265300	Ron Street Fighter versus King of Fighters? No. You hate them all? Not hate, but I just
6265300	6270220	don't really care. I will tell you this. Any of the King of Fighters games on Saturn have
6270220	6283220	a bitch of a load time. Seriously. In between rounds. Load time. So, next email. Um, hi
6283220	6287540	all. I was just wondering if it was possible for you guys to create a widget for Samsung
6287540	6291980	phones for your podcast, as I would love to be able to listen to you on the go and download
6291980	6298980	your shows wherever I am. Thanks Simil. Um, I've not even heard of the Samsung phones
6298980	6303100	widget thing. That's not something I'm familiar with. Send us more information on how to make
6303100	6306220	one. If it's just used doing a simple website or something, I'm sure we can figure it out
6306220	6310620	if it involves programming like an iPhone application. Well, I don't know so much about
6310620	6314780	that. Um, if it's something you can connect to iTunes, I don't know if your phone, I don't
6314780	6318980	know because there's a lot of Samsung phones. Um, if your phone, my old phone was a Samsung
6318980	6322580	and if it has a memory card, like my old one, you can put your own songs or your own music
6322580	6326420	on it basically. Um, you should be able to just sync it up with iTunes and download our
6326420	6331060	podcast on iTunes and do it that way. That's the best thing I can think of. If all fails,
6331060	6336260	we can look in to see what that is. Yeah, if it's easy enough, why not? Um, we also
6336260	6341060	got one, um, these are actually put in, that last one and this one that I'm about to actually
6341060	6345860	put in through the website. Cool. So that's pretty cool. Um, first of all, the catch thing
6345860	6351060	you got here is fucking terrible. Okay. Um, I got it wrong because it's really confusing
6351060	6355900	and erased my whole goddamn message. Um, I don't really think that's the fault of the
6355900	6361260	program. Um, anyway, I was just wondering why the show takes so long to go up now. It
6361260	6365700	used to go up the day after recording. Do not take this as a complaint. I am just curious.
6365700	6371820	Um, just because we, my set up here changed and I have two computers now that I have to
6371820	6375660	go back and forth between and then also this week I was on a work trip. So it's just, I
6375660	6381500	try to do it as I can. Other people are offering to help make the process go faster. So we'll
6381500	6387340	hopefully get on that. So sorry. Last email and actually, you know what, I'm going to
6387340	6392660	save this one for a last minute story, Rob. Okay. But I am going to go ahead and credit
6392660	6399140	the story to, um, well they didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say, um, Nigel, thank
6399140	6405500	you. All right. And it will be one of our last minute stories. Congrats. You have contributed
6405500	6410860	to the show. All right. Level up. The winner is you. Here's a no prize. All right. If you
6410860	6415820	want to send us emails, mailbag orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send them to. Let's get back
6415820	6422180	into some gaming news. Loki. Yes. Um, so there's some really neat download content that's going
6422180	6429780	to be coming out very soon for F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin. It's called the Toy Soldiers
6429780	6434460	download content. And what it is is it's a few multiplayer maps that they're adding in,
6434460	6438700	but what's kind of neat about it is it's all done from the perspective that you're small
6438700	6444860	little toy soldiers fighting in these giant areas. So for example, some of the maps that
6444860	6450660	they have, they have, um, you know, a hospital room that you'll actually fight around in.
6450660	6455740	They have a playground. And then finally, one that Jamie, I think, will like. They have
6455740	6462980	one that you fight inside of a pinball machine. Sweet! Um, so yeah. Very cool. Kind of a unique,
6462980	6466740	you know, twist to the whole multiplayer stuff. And I'm glad that they're actually kind of
6466740	6470220	having a little bit of fun with it. But, um, looks pretty sweet. I have to say that the
6470220	6475220	pinball machine looks the best out of all of them. Now only if the giant, you know,
6475220	6483500	metal balls rolling around in there too. That'd be cool. Hmm. But, um, no word on when exactly
6483500	6489260	these will be available. Oh, I guess it'll be in April and it will be free. So that's
6489260	6496580	awesome. Free stuff is always welcome. That's the best kind of download content is free.
6496580	6503680	Well, a new trademark has been filed this week. Sing Hero is the trademark. Of course,
6503680	6510940	you know, that was by Activision and Blizzard, the folks behind Guitar Hero and DJ Hero.
6510940	6515940	Apparently now Sing Hero has been patented. Um, what do you think? Is this going to be
6515940	6524900	their version of Sing Star or Karaoke Revolution or Milk of a Hero franchise? Mm hmm. Uh, although
6524900	6529800	I will say though, keep in mind this company also trademarked Drum Villain and I don't
6529800	6534060	think that ever happened. No. So just because they trademarked it doesn't mean the game
6534060	6539060	is actually going to happen. Yeah, but they also could mean just because, you know, they
6539060	6544360	trademarked Drum Villain, maybe they just rolled that into Guitar Hero World Tour. But
6544360	6547900	Singing is in Guitar Hero World Tour, so I'm not sure why they are going to have this whole
6547900	6552700	separate game. Well, maybe this is going to have more pop music. That could be. Oh boy.
6552700	6557620	Well, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear stories like this, I can just hear
6557620	6562100	the sounds of the Guitar Hero franchise being milked even more and that's like after seeing
6562100	6565740	the arcade game this week and everything and it's just like, I'm starting to get pretty
6565740	6570300	sick of all this stuff and it just makes me angsty because, you know, it used to be such
6570300	6574500	a good game, but now it's just getting, like beating a dead horse. So I get angsty and
6574500	6594420	that's why the FUs of the week happen. I have a couple of FUs, but one of them is a very
6594420	6602300	big, very major one and it's directed towards my body for reasons that I choose not to disclose
6602300	6608180	publicly at this time, but certain people know what I'm talking about. And the second
6608180	6619180	one goes towards a lack of tact. I'm dead. Loki! Happy to Burger King for burning my
6619180	6625300	fries. I have never, honestly I'd expect this kind of thing from McDonald's because they
6625300	6630420	fuck up their fries more times than not, but Burger King, come on man, your fries are usually
6630420	6635940	pretty tasteless and they're fixed by ketchup, but these fries were burnt. I mean, they were
6635940	6641980	brown. Oh, and the other thing too, if you ask me if I want ketchup with my fries, don't
6641980	6647040	just not give me ketchup. Don't ask me the question and just say, oh, here's no ketchup
6647040	6651340	for you. You'd like some ketchup, wouldn't you? But I'm not giving you any. I'm not giving
6651340	6661060	you any. So F you to minimum wage Burger King workers. Well, geez, and as GS68 in chat says,
6661060	6666260	poor, poor Loki's fries. I don't really have anything that major this week. I guess two
6666260	6671460	F yous. One F you goes to jet lag because that sucks and my sleep has been all screwed
6671460	6675500	up like for the past four days because of it. I was in Washington DC this week, by the
6675500	6680180	way, just for a few days. If you were following me on Twitter, you probably saw some of that
6680180	6685020	video. Otherwise my only other F you would go to the fact that we have no Dunkin Donuts
6685020	6691100	here in California, at least in NorCal. And that's sad because I fricking love their coffee.
6691100	6696220	But I actually, I actually brought back a Dunkin Donut for my roommate on the plane
6696220	6700940	from Texas because I always gush about, you know, Dunkin Donuts, even though the donuts,
6700940	6704780	the donuts are only okay. Like to me, I'm not as huge on the donut. It's the coffee.
6704780	6711620	I love the coffee. They're not bad. If my five year old memory serves me right. They're
6711620	6717500	not bad at all. So that's really it. Those are my not so serious F yous of the week,
6717500	6720780	but that's what I've got. I guess the jet, the jet lag one's actually pretty serious.
6720780	6725020	That really was annoying. I did want to say though about a Sing Hero. I wanted to read
6725020	6729140	some comments here in chat about that because I thought one of these in particular was pretty
6729140	6735660	good. Game Guru, I believe said that they might just be trying to protect their trademark.
6735660	6739580	I think it's just protecting trademarks says Game Guru about Sing Hero. And that could
6739580	6742540	be the case. Do you think they're just trying to trademark the name so nobody else tries
6742540	6749020	to use it? That could be. Maybe. I hope that's the case. If that's the case, then I remember
6749020	6755140	a Game Guru also says, I always remember that Dunkin Donut cereal. Me too. Hmm. I actually
6755140	6759980	remember that too. They sold that here too. And they don't have Dunkin Donuts. Oh, whatever.
6759980	6764260	Hit stun says F you Sky. You have arcades with Street Fighter four and we don't. I do.
6764260	6769140	Oh, I guess here in California. Yeah. I just haven't driven to them. Not around us. Not
6769140	6775100	here in SAC, but we do have the Guitar Hero arcade now and they have Mario Kart too, which
6775100	6780100	I didn't check out, but they have that. I thought that would be fun. You can go play
6780100	6786180	it. Yeah, but I don't know. I didn't really care for Mario Kart arcade. It was kind of
6786180	6790740	lame. It was, but maybe the sequel has fixed some things. You never know. No doubt it.
6790740	6797900	All right, let's get into another story. They need more F-Zero GX. They do need more F-Zero
6797900	6803500	GX. Well, there is another interesting thing. You know how all these Lego games been coming
6803500	6810900	out? There's more. More, more, more. Which means people must be buying all the ones that
6810900	6815020	are out there now. You know what though? They're doing it for a good reason because they are
6815020	6821100	pretty damn fun. But once it's sort of a late franchise now, they're doing a Harry Potter
6821100	6826420	Lego. It's never too late. I'm not saying what exactly it's going to be, but maybe it's
6826420	6834940	going to be a walk through some of the other books. And then there is a Lego Indiana Jones
6834940	6839980	2 The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. As long as you don't have the fucking ending crap
6839980	6846540	in it. God damn it. And they're also pitching to Peter Jackson for a game based off of the
6846540	6854300	upcoming Hobbit movie. Lego Hobbits? Lego Hobbits. I totally saw the whole Harry Potter
6854300	6858740	thing coming out. After all, they do have the Lego Harry Potter toys. And Lego Indiana
6858740	6864860	Jones 2 or whatever they're going to be doing. I love Lego Hobbit. As much as the fourth
6864860	6870420	movie sucked, the first game really, really sold well for them and still continues to
6870420	6877020	sell well for them. I'm not surprised at one bit. But basing your game, I would have to
6877020	6884220	guess it would probably be the original game plus the new stuff as well. I don't know.
6884220	6887300	They're kind of fun. I mean, I understand why they're coming out. It's not like one
6887300	6892060	of these games I look at and go, WTF? Why are we getting this? But I get this. So it's
6892060	6895500	not really a surprise at all. And you've been speculating, Loki, for quite some time that
6895500	6899660	the Harry Potter game is going to be the next Lego thing. Of course. This is no surprise
6899660	6903460	at all. If they've got a toy for it, they're going to make a game for it. Now, if you see
6903460	6908140	like all of a sudden Lego Halo, you know, stuffed toys coming out, then you better believe
6908140	6911020	that there's going to be a Lego Halo game at some point. But otherwise it's an April
6911020	6915700	Fools joke. Yes, otherwise it's an April Fools joke. Fair enough. I wouldn't be surprised
6915700	6918500	if we see another Lego Batman game because that's something that they can keep adding
6918500	6927900	to and basically have unlimited content for because they're not basing off movies. So
6927900	6931420	that's a problem basing stuff off movies. They don't make any more movies. You have
6931420	6935860	no more games. Another comment from Game Guru in chat. Unfortunately, Lego Prince of Persia
6935860	6941460	will likely be next when the toys come out. Will it though? Because they rebooted the
6941460	6946940	Prince of Persia franchise recently. Won't they make this sequel in that kind of way?
6946940	6951540	I don't know if they'll do a Lego Prince of Persia game. The problem being is that it's
6951540	6957520	a Warner Brothers own franchise. Well, the Lego Star Wars stuff that was LucasArts, but
6957520	6964500	you know, basically they're doing Warner Brothers stuff. So, maybe. I mean, if they do, if the
6964500	6968420	movie comes out and it's really popular and stuff and everyone's interested in it, I don't
6968420	6971900	know if they're really going to do it. It would all depend on how many toys come out
6971900	6976460	and how well the toys do. Rice Princess in chat says, I love Lego games. I love Harry
6976460	6984540	Potter games. The two combined would make my head asplode. Let's see. Gio Vaidya says,
6984540	6990020	Lego doesn't sell the HP sets anymore. You can't even get the sets off Lego.com. That's
6990020	6997900	true. Hmm. Interesting. Dark Tetsuya says, still waiting on Lego Watchmen. Yeah, I don't
6997900	7003860	know about that one. Will it come complete with a detachable penis? For Dr. Manhattan.
7003860	7009060	Special soundtrack by King Missile. No, he'll have, he'll have his little like, you know,
7009060	7017580	molecular underpants, which I did not understand because, you know, they, he could wear underpants
7017580	7022020	but he didn't and he doesn't really exist. I never saw the movie. The whole point was
7022020	7028180	that he's detached from humanity and humanity's standard so it doesn't matter to him if he's
7028180	7032420	dressed or not. Because, I mean, seriously, if you think about it, one of the Viet Cong
7032420	7036540	will be really scared of a giant glowing blue penis that's coming towards them. I mean,
7036540	7042500	you know why? I am so down with Dr. Manhattan. He was wearing his black pants. Exactly, that's
7042500	7045700	what I'm saying. He should have just been buck wild there. I mean, I'm just going to
7045700	7049020	do the show naked from now on. I agree with what Dr. Manhattan said. Really, it doesn't
7049020	7054940	matter, you know, no amount of blue penis makes that movie any good, so, oh well. Sad
7054940	7060220	trombone. Sad trombone, yes, very much so. Something that's not so sad though is the
7060220	7066420	popularity of Call of Duty 4. It has reached 15 million online players now, which is no
7066420	7071260	surprise for anybody that plays Call of Duty 4 and of course, you know, this will be good
7071260	7075780	for the new Call of Duty game that's scheduled to come out this year later, Call of Duty
7075780	7082260	Modern Warfare 2. So, that should do just as well, since it's going to be Infinity Ward
7082260	7088580	again, because everyone knows that Treyarch sucks. I know a lot of people who play Call
7088580	7096260	of Duty 4. This number doesn't surprise me one bit. No. Well, as if there weren't enough
7096260	7099820	people that were going to be lining up to buy the new Beatles Rock Band game. I'm not
7099820	7104700	lining up to buy this game. Well, you're one of not many, because there's a lot of people
7104700	7108660	who are very interested in this game. Apparently though, Danny Harrison, that would be the
7108660	7114460	son of George Harrison, one of the Beatles who passed away a few years ago, he was interviewed
7114460	7119820	by Billboard recently, and they were talking about the Beatles Rock Band game. Apparently,
7119820	7125220	what Danny said is that, or it might be Donnie, sorry, it's going to come with some new material,
7125220	7133380	stuff that has never been heard and never released. Huh. That could be very interesting.
7133380	7136420	So that, I mean, as if this game wasn't going to sell to the Beatles collectors already,
7136420	7140740	imagine if this game has never before heard Beatles stuff. I couldn't believe that anything
7140740	7147260	like that still exists, to be honest, but there you go. Apparently, by the way, Donnie,
7147260	7151460	who's the son of, of course, George Harrison, he's been a big part of actually trying to
7151460	7155300	get the Beatles Rock Band to happen. He's in a band of his own who has an album coming
7155300	7160100	out this month. He actually took the project to Apple and sort of convinced everyone, because
7160100	7166500	of course, not Apple as in the iPhone people, but Apple Music, right, and convinced everyone
7166500	7172380	to sort of have a presentation. The game has been in the making for two years. They say
7172380	7177980	it's historically accurate, a real headache, but it's the most enjoyable work that he's
7177980	7183620	been a part of apparently. So it sounds like it could be interesting. Could be. 9-9-0-9
7183620	7188620	is when this game's coming out. It's pretty hard to forget that release date. Well, hey,
7188620	7193820	all we have to do is remember Dreamcast. Or that. Yep. Which, oh, you know, I forgot to
7193820	7197380	mention in the gaming week, we actually did bust out the Dreamcast and go through some
7197380	7203500	Sonic Adventure. Nice. Yeah. All of our VMUs still work. Oh my gosh. We have all of our
7203500	7213060	Samba files too. So, here's some other news. You know, Wallace and Gromit, still out there.
7213060	7219580	There is actually a game coming out on March 24th with a demo on the 16th. Telltale Games
7219580	7226700	is putting this out. But it's part of, as far as I'm aware, the episodic Wallace and
7226700	7235700	Gromit's Grand Adventures. So, hey, keep your eyes open for it. And there's also gonna be
7235700	7244060	another Strong Bad game. If you pre-order Wallace and Gromit, you'll get a full episode
7244060	7251740	of actually Sam and Max and Strong Bad. So there you go. That's pretty cool. Nice. Nice
7251740	7259700	little bonus there. I like full games as bonuses. That's a good deal. Definitely. Now this is
7259700	7267900	kind of not new to the MMO scene, but Final Fantasy XI has finally jumped on board, much
7267900	7272900	like the Blizzard Authenticator. They now have something very similar to that that will
7272900	7281860	generate random passcodes every few minutes, I guess. It's the Final Fantasy XI security
7281860	7287380	token. And, of course, the constantly changing login passwords will apparently protect your
7287380	7295620	account from hackers. And the only thing, though, is they haven't released a price for
7295620	7302900	it yet. But it will come with some in-game exclusive items when you purchase this token.
7302900	7312300	Huh. Okay. So you get special stuff in the actual game? Yes. You get, like, stuff in
7312300	7318300	the game. Hm. Nah, I'm still not interested in going back. Sorry. Alright. One more story
7318300	7322100	for you guys, then we're gonna open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on
7322100	7326060	Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Oh, I was gonna, real quickly, I was gonna mention the Van
7326060	7333020	Deal Collection. Yeah, $14.99 now. Oh my gosh, on Xbox 360? And Windows. Wow, they're really
7333020	7338860	trying to get new crack addicts on that game, because, you know, you pay that once, they
7338860	7342740	might as well just give the game away, because you get 30 days for free with that, and $14.99
7342740	7347140	is how much it costs a month, right? Yeah. I'm surprised they haven't gone the route
7347140	7350260	of just doing a downloadable demo, or have they, and I just missed that. I don't know.
7350260	7353780	Maybe they did, and I might have missed that. Alright, look, one more story for you guys,
7353780	7358980	completely different side note here, but something also to kind of take a note. Here's the thing.
7358980	7363940	This guy from a Yale University, he's a Yale University student, so you know he's smart.
7363940	7369700	His name is Jesse Meiman. Or is connected. Yeah, could be. There's a report in the Cincinnati
7369700	7375580	Enquirer that Jesse's a little pissed off, because he flew US Airways, and he was flying
7375580	7381500	them in December from Connecticut to Ohio, and they basically lost his Xbox 360. He went
7381500	7385420	to pick up his luggage after he landed, and he noticed that everything was there except
7385420	7390780	for the Xbox 360 and all the accompanying components, so I'm assuming he believes that
7390780	7397940	it was theft. His suit says after that that he got weeks of an unconscionable runaround,
7397940	7404640	so you know what happened next, right? He's suing them. He's suing US Airways for a million
7404640	7412860	dollars for the loss of the Xbox. That apparently is the maximal amount allowable by law. One
7412860	7419380	million dollars is what he's suing for. He says that thing was his DVD player. He's a
7419380	7423740	film studies major. I don't know why you're using the Xbox 360 issue. Well, I guess I
7423740	7427980	can see that. Don't you have a Blu-ray player? Upscale on the HD, right? I guess. But anyway,
7427980	7431580	here's the thing. He wants the airline to pay him $1,700 for the loss of the gaming
7431580	7436020	system because apparently he probably had his own editions on it. I don't know. And
7436020	7443620	for non-economic distress of at least $25,000, but he's seeking the maximum, one million.
7443620	7448140	Go figure. I don't know exactly how that works. But here's the thing. US Air would like to
7448140	7455860	point out their policy state that the federal loss limits are capped out at $3,300 per bag,
7455860	7462260	and the airline's luggage policy excludes liability for electronics. So something you
7462260	7465900	might want to think about before you take these expensive electronics online. But if
7465900	7469660	that specific thing is missing, then it's clearly a case of theft. Yeah. I could see
7469660	7477340	if maybe he, you know, and the other thing they could do too is they have his bag, you
7477340	7483380	know, they have it scaled in there, they know what the weight of the bag was, and then when
7483380	7487860	the bag gets to wherever they should have scaled it again, oh, there's a clear difference
7487860	7494300	in weight in the bag. I mean, those Xbox 360s weigh like 15 pounds, you know. Obviously
7494300	7499060	they stole it. I mean, there's no way that it didn't break, you know, during the flight,
7499060	7504020	which, you know, that I don't see really being the airline's fault. I mean, but the fact
7504020	7508420	that it was stolen is a little different. But at that same time, he should only get
7508420	7514740	compensated for the replacement of the system. Not a million dollars, not even $3,300. Some
7514740	7519220	comments from chat, because of course you know the chat is interested in this. SSJ100Matt
7519220	7524060	says, I always bring my console on the plane with me or not at all. True, he could have
7524060	7528660	brought it in just to carry on, right, if it was that important. Dekeman says, if it
7528660	7532900	was broken, yes, but it was stolen. If you ask for a million, though, suddenly a settlement
7532900	7537220	of $500,000 is looking pretty good. So maybe this guy's just trying to highball it, I don't
7537220	7545220	know. You just try to highball it. Gripper01 says, God help Microsoft if it ever red rings.
7545220	7551320	What a good point. So, alright. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username
7551320	7554980	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to open up the Skype line, take a couple of
7554980	7559060	calls. Probably not too many tonight, because we are running a little long tonight, but
7559060	7563660	we also want to get to last minute stories here in just a little bit, and all that fun
7563660	7567620	stuff. So, go ahead and give us a call now. We do have a call, we'll go to that. Hi, you're
7567620	7576380	on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? It's GS68. Hey, GS68, what's on your mind? Hold on. Okay,
7576380	7584420	I'll wait. I got Gradius Rebirth this week. What? I got Gradius Rebirth this week. It
7584420	7591900	came out this Monday, much to my surprise. Oh, Gradius 3, tell us, wait, Gradius Rebirth
7591900	7598020	or Gradius 3? Rebirth. Ooh, tell us a little bit about Gradius Rebirth. I'm going to put
7598020	7603900	you on with Loki here, I got to take care of something in the studio. Alright, then.
7603900	7611820	So, tell us about the game, what do you think of it? Yeah, basically, it's a new Gradius
7611820	7617420	title, and it looks more like a 16-bit or 32-bit Gradius game, kind of like Gradius
7617420	7626500	for your, a bit like Gradius Gaiden, and it's more of a remix of older Gradius games rather
7626500	7633380	than a completely new title. I'm watching a replay of myself right now, and my replay
7633380	7643140	is on stage 2, which looks like a level from the MSX and MSX game. Okay. Sounds pretty
7643140	7650980	cool. But, yeah, it's only five stages, though. For 1,000 waypoints, that might turn off a
7650980	7658940	few players, but as a result, Gradius 3, I just had to get in the game. And one of my
7658940	7665420	favorite things is on stage 1, there are two enemies, and it destroys either one first,
7665420	7670060	you can change the entire stage depending on which enemies are, like, if you don't destroy
7670060	7675500	either, the stage continues as normal, but if you destroy the top enemy, the stage becomes
7675500	7679780	frozen. If you destroy the bottom enemy, all the units in the stage become active and the
7679780	7690020	stage gets harder. Huh. That's kind of neat. Yeah. And then, looking at the weaponry sort
7690020	7695020	of game, you have the usual Gradius title, which is like regular missile and double and
7695020	7701580	laser, and then you have another one where you have a bomb attack, and then a twin laser
7701580	7707020	that's weaker than the, it's not as powerful as the regular laser, but it shoots faster,
7707020	7713900	and then there's two unlockable setups that are more or less for more challenging players,
7713900	7720300	I guess. Hmm. Well, that was pretty cool. I was actually kind of thinking of checking
7720300	7726940	this out, I just haven't gotten a chance to download it yet, that and that new one that's
7726940	7731580	coming out on Monday here, Bit Trip, or was it Bit Trip Beat or whatever, it looks pretty
7731580	7738420	awesome. But hopefully, you know, I know they've been probably a little bit inspired by the
7738420	7743060	Mega Man 9 stuff, so hopefully we see more of these retro remakes that aren't exactly,
7743060	7750300	you know, retro, I guess. That's kind of cool. It still kind of feels like a new Gradius
7750300	7757380	to me, at least. It was Mega Man 9, it felt like it was playing an old NES game. Yeah.
7757380	7764860	You know, I always... Yeah, because it got, for a game that some say looks like 16-bit,
7764860	7773580	the graphics are a little, on the more colorful side. Hmm. I hope they bring some of this
7773580	7778420	stuff out, you know, I can see you make, they should do a Gradius collection on like DS
7778420	7782940	or something, and have this in there. They have a Gradius collection on PSP in Japan.
7782940	7787620	I know, but they, well they have it here too, but they all have... They have a Parodius collection.
7787620	7793380	But they need it on DS as well. I'll use Salamander collection, but the fact that it's my old
7793380	7800380	PSP has a crappy D-pad, it's turning me off from it. Hmm. And I don't want to get a new
7800380	7805820	PSP, because then I'll have to restart my DKMax save files, because they're locked at
7805820	7814900	a current PSP. Yeah. Well, cool. Is there any other WiiWare games you're looking forward
7814900	7823460	to checking out? Um, don't think so. I have a few favorites that I want to buy. I have
7823460	7836820	a few older games that I've been wanting to buy. Cool. So, crisis averted? I guess. Oh,
7836820	7842460	no, we have Rob trying to find his microphone. Yes, we're back to normal, sorry, but I'm
7842460	7848860	sorry I missed the review, but let me just quickly ask for a summary. Is it worth breaking
7848860	7858380	my boycott over? Hmm. It's certainly not the best... Well, it depends on what game is enough
7858380	7864820	to make you break your boycott. I mean, there's more of a game for hardcore Gradius fans,
7864820	7869380	like, I mean, most people feel like it's part of the fact that it's only five stages, and
7869380	7875300	it doesn't really add much to the series. Hmm. Well, yeah, I know, and there's some
7875300	7879300	comments from chat, like GameGuru says, Final Fantasy IV, the after years will be cool as
7879300	7883060	well, and yeah, those are other types of games I'm looking forward to, so I just hope Nintendo
7883060	7886540	will fix their freaking storage problems sooner rather than later, because, you know, even
7886540	7894380	I admit my boycott is getting stupid. I'd like Defender Castle to get this game. We'll
7894380	7897300	see, we'll see. I do love Defender Castle, though. Alright, we're gonna let you go so
7897300	7899820	we can get some more calls, but thank you for the review. Sorry I wasn't here to hear
7899820	7905560	it all. Alright. Alright. Yeah, it's cool. Later. Alright, yeah. We had, like, an insect
7905560	7908760	outbreak here in studio, because a piece of my sandwich fell on the ground, so all the
7908760	7913480	ants rose up from the ground and were like, rah! They rise from the grave. They rise from
7913480	7918580	your grave, and so they all decided to, yeah, have a piece of that. I thought it was cute
7918580	7922580	how you took care of it. Well, I took care of it right away, right? Alright, let's take
7922580	7926140	a couple more calls here tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this? Hey, that
7926140	7931460	was pretty quick. It's me, Ranma. Hi, Ranma. Hey, what's up, everyone? Not much. We're
7931460	7937100	ant-free now. What's up? I just want you guys to know that I took one for the team two weeks
7937100	7941100	ago, and I want some type of compensation for it. Oh, dear. What's this about? We don't
7941100	7946940	have compensation. We don't get compensated, so this has got to be good. I actually sat
7946940	7951940	there and watched Street Fighter, The Legend of Chun-Li. Hey, no one made you do that.
7951940	7955900	We warned you in advance. Yeah, that's right. We told everybody that was gonna be a pretty
7955900	7961060	shitty movie. See, the fact of the matter is I didn't even pay for it. I went and downloaded
7961060	7965940	it, because I said I am not spending $1,125 on this piece of crap. Not that we would usually
7965940	7973180	advocate piracy, but maybe in that case it'll be okay. Yeah. I mean, they made the movie
7973180	7977620	a little bit too realistic, and I don't care if I give spoilers or not, because that's
7977620	7984400	how bad this movie was. Alright. Number one. Bison should not be walking around in a mustache
7984400	7994100	and a goatee. Okay. Number two. Vega's mask should not look like a cross between Vader
7994100	8003220	and Shy Guy. Ew. Number three. In the fight sequence in the club, Chun-Li could have at
8003220	8009100	least had some type of blue dress or something to signify her traditional outfit, you know?
8009100	8013940	And how the hell does she have injuries on her when you didn't look like she had any
8013940	8022180	in the movie when she was fighting? I don't know. Not for nothing, I'll say this. After
8022180	8029140	seeing this movie, the original Street Fighter is ten times better, and I am so looking forward
8029140	8038540	to Dragon Ball Evolution after this. I don't know, it doesn't look, well, Dragon Ball Evolution
8038540	8044860	doesn't look as bad. Pretty much. I'm just saying, I think after seeing this, that's
8044860	8050340	gonna be a lot better. Maybe he could do both in one day, and then if you watch them back-to-back
8050340	8054220	and you watch this first one that's really craptacular, the second one won't seem so
8054220	8062900	bad. Do you think it's a shoo-in to win all the Razzie awards next year? No, I don't think
8062900	8073100	it's that bad. Now if U.A. Boyle had anything to do with it, by default, it would. Okay.
8073100	8079060	Do you think U.A. Boyle makes better movies than this? I can make better movies than this,
8079060	8090180	and I have an amateur digital camcorder I got from Joe Dea that I'm borrowing. Well, congratulations.
8090180	8098140	My sister, who is graduating from Hofstra as a degree in Filming, she could do something
8098140	8107500	better than this. I've seen her do better work than this, you know? Well, every actor,
8107500	8114740	every director usually has a stinker somewhere in their career, so what can you do? I know,
8114740	8118780	I know, and it does help the fact that my roommate is a big Chun-Li fan, and I warned
8118780	8124820	him, so, yeah. Well, you know, we all told you it would suck, and I have yet to hear
8124820	8129140	anybody say it's good. I want to hear a good review on this movie. Has Rotten Tomatoes,
8129140	8134460	is it zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes? I think it is, somebody just linked Rotten Tomatoes
8134460	8137480	there in chat, I'm gonna look at this, see if it still has a zero percent from all the
8137480	8145140	critics out there. I don't wanna see your stupid ad, come on. I'm skipping the ad right
8145140	8152900	now. Yeah, I'm trying to skip it too, but it's so frickin' slow. Alright. Four percent.
8152900	8158180	Somebody gave it a positive review. Here it is from Variety, of course it's Variety. Neither
8158180	8161980	the best nor the worst of movies derived from video games, Street Fighter, The Legend of
8161980	8170140	Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to oogle besides the titular heroine. Huh.
8170140	8174420	Well there you go. A whopping four percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, Rama, nobody forced
8174420	8178100	you to watch it, I don't know what to tell you. I was bored, what can I tell you, I couldn't
8178100	8184740	get any alcohol. No compensation for Morison's Radio, sorry. Our compensation is go watch
8184740	8190920	Silent Hill again and see a good game movie. Yes. Or the original Mortal Kombat if you
8190920	8195780	ask me. The first Mortal Kombat was fantastic. Yeah, it's not bad. Yes it was. I'd even,
8195780	8204180	I would even say it was really close to theme. The second one is Time Is Life, you know,
8204180	8210500	I wish I had back. I hope the third one comes out some day. Alright, Rama we're gonna let
8210500	8214540	you go so we can get some more calls, but take care buddy, okay? You too, alright, later
8214540	8218620	everyone. We'll try to do at least one more call here. Do we have any last minute stories?
8218620	8225740	Dark Sakura, I know you had one. You alright over there? Dark Sakura's gonna hopefully
8225740	8231620	give us a last minute story here. Anyway, I'm glad the microphone didn't catch that.
8231620	8234260	Let me actually go ahead and take a call because our phone's ringing off the hook here. It
8234260	8238860	just took a little bit. Hi Aaron, I'll show you, who's this? Sorry. Hey, this is Ray,
8238860	8243020	this is actually my first time calling, I've been listening to this show for four years
8243020	8247760	now I guess. Well. Two years now, I've missed once. It's good to hear from you, I'm sorry
8247760	8252540	I missed your name because you're a little quiet. What was your name again? Oh, Ray.
8252540	8259780	Ry? R-A-Y. Oh. R-A-Y, yeah, it's my real name, heaven forbid. Okay. Well what is up, Ray?
8259780	8264420	Uh, nothing really, it's 11 o'clock on spring break, all my friends are away, I have nothing
8264420	8269100	to do but stay up till 11 o'clock and listen to this show, I love it. I don't think I've
8269100	8273100	missed a week. Well, thank you very much, we appreciate you listening to the show. Did
8273100	8276700	you hear something on tonight's show that you wanted to comment on? Any of the stories?
8276700	8282980	Yeah, actually, uh, indie games pretty much. I can't remember the specifics because I was
8282980	8285580	just thinking of something to call about, so I'm not just here battling like an idiot
8285580	8290260	on the internet, but Cave Story, has anyone played it? I'm pretty sure it's low-key, might
8290260	8295140	have. Um, no, tell us a little more about this game, I don't think I've heard of this.
8295140	8301980	Uh, Cave Story. Have you ever heard of Cave Story? It's a PC title, it's pretty cool.
8301980	8306260	Oh, I guess it's coming to the Wii. Oh, okay. It is coming to the Wii, that's why I brought
8306260	8311020	it up, because it's getting a graphical redesign, but on the PC, it's free, it's translated
8311020	8317300	from Japanese, and it's kind of a, I want to say classic style shooter, sort of like
8317300	8322300	Mega Man, but a whole lot harder. No, wait, I'm lying, no, it's a little easier, because
8322300	8327860	I beat it, and I'm not that good at Mega Man games. I thought I'd notice that Google Cave
8327860	8333660	Story or English translation should come up one of the first few topics. Well, our chat
8333660	8337120	room sure seems to know this game, and I'm actually trying to look up a little bit online
8337120	8341220	to see if I know anything about this, and sadly, no, I don't know how I missed this,
8341220	8345260	I guess I just, I'm not cool. I've talked about Cave Story before. Have you? Yeah, a
8345260	8349500	couple times, I don't care for it, but it's neat. Um, I guess they're making a version
8349500	8356380	on PSP as well, it looks like? Homebrew. It's a Homebrew project. Oh, okay. Huh, interesting
8356380	8362580	though. How did you find this game? I was looking through a list of Homebrew PSP games,
8362580	8367740	and I found it there, and I learned more about it, and it had a PC version, which was really
8367740	8371780	good. Really good. It's the same game, almost, but it looks bigger, better. I don't know
8371780	8379780	why, is it just me, or does this game look very, like, old-school 8-bit NES-style graphics?
8379780	8387900	Precisely. Another thing I wanted to mention was, um, Team Fortress 2 had an 8-bit demake
8387900	8395660	called Gang Garrison 2. I have not seen this. Oh, it's a side-scrolling, isometric shooter,
8395660	8401060	but it's team-based online, and it's anywhere from 10 players at a time to 100 players at
8401060	8406660	a time. Huh. Yeah, you can play as all nine major classes, and it's kind of simplified,
8406660	8411500	but there's still technique to it, like, uh, the Pyro has the Puffer instead of the Backbringer,
8411500	8415980	there's none of the special extra weapons, and you can deflect rockets back, and 50 on
8415980	8421100	50 matches are crazy. I've installed it on the computer lab at, uh, my school. It's pretty
8421100	8427340	neat. Do they let you do that? We have a kind of lax administrator, and we put it on thumb
8427340	8433180	drives anyway, so it's alright. It's only five megs. Gotcha. Alright, alright. Um,
8433180	8436700	here's my question. I noticed, you mentioned this game as a demake, and we've talked about,
8436700	8439700	I know last week's show we were talking about, like, a Final Fantasy X demake and some of
8439700	8444260	this stuff. What do you think makes these demakes so popular, where people go back in
8444260	8447460	time and remake games such as, like, you know, Team Fortress 2 or whatever, whatever the
8447460	8451860	game is? Why do you think people want to keep remaking, or Guitar Hero has had tons of these,
8451860	8456340	like, in the Commodore 64 and stuff. Why do people want to remake these games on old systems?
8456340	8461540	What do you think is the allure of it? Well, it's kind of like, almost the opposite of,
8461540	8469620	uh, the, what was that? I think it's the opposite of, uh, say, just a second here, how Mega
8469620	8477700	Man X, one of the later X games, took the classic Mega Man action from a pseudo-3D view.
8477700	8481300	It's sort of strange seeing the new medium, exactly as with the Guitar Hero Commodore
8481300	8489540	remake. Hmm. I don't know, I don't get into a whole lot of these. I don't know if I necessarily,
8489540	8493060	usually I'm just kind of like, oh, hmm, that's neat, but I don't really have to, like, play
8493060	8496020	the whole thing in its entirety, so it's just kind of, it's kind of interesting that there's
8496020	8500260	this whole kind of community around there, around the demakes. I always thought it was interesting.
8500980	8505380	There's a Silent Hill 2 remake, I think it was, like, Soundless Mountain 2.
8506180	8509620	Really? For what system? I know. PC.
8510340	8511860	Huh. Interesting.
8511860	8518820	Look up, uh, Google TIG source demake composition, or, uh, Competition Camera Witch,
8519380	8524980	these funny titles sometimes. They had one for, uh, like a Dig Dug demake, I wonder how they
8524980	8527620	pulled that off. I don't know how they pulled that off.
8527620	8530660	Dig Dug demake? Wasn't Dig Dug kind of an old-ass game to begin with?
8531620	8535940	Yeah, that's what I was wondering. They have one for Left 4 Dead called Left 4K Dead,
8535940	8540180	which is Java-based, and it's 4K at 4 kilobytes already.
8540180	8542340	Huh. Wow.
8542340	8544580	Pretty sure they had a Bioshock demake, too.
8544580	8548580	Nah, I've seen the Bioshock demake. Interesting. Wow, there's a whole lot.
8548580	8552660	And again, lots of positive feedback to Cave Story in our chatroom. GameGuru says,
8552660	8556820	but yeah, Cave Story is a Metroidvania worth buying and it's free on PC. Any PC gamer should
8556820	8562180	own it. I might have to just seek that out. So you found that amongst all the chat about Wang?
8563700	8564740	What? In the chatroom?
8564740	8569380	No, I didn't. I haven't been paying attention to chat, sorry. Well, I mean, I have, but I haven't.
8569380	8572580	What's the big deal with Wang? Oh, nothing. Just discussion about Watchmen.
8572580	8574020	Oh, jeez. Alright.
8574020	8576420	Oh, well, I saw Watchmen. That was an amazing movie.
8576420	8581220	Did you read the comics? I've read the comic. They almost used the
8581220	8584740	book as a shooting script. Well, I'm kind of disappointed it left out the death of
8584740	8589860	the first Night Owl, but they had to make room. Well, question for you. Do you think
8589860	8593860	the movie ending was better or the comic ending? And don't spoil it because I haven't seen it.
8593860	8598180	Don't spoil it. Just say which one you prefer. They could not have pulled off the comic ending.
8598180	8602980	They would have left so many people scratching their heads and to fit the missing writer plot
8602980	8608020	into there would have added another hour. The comic ending, the movie ending was so
8608020	8613780	streamlined and it worked. I honestly think that the movie ending better fits the audience today.
8613780	8618260	That's my opinion. Yeah. Without going into how hokey the comic one was.
8619620	8625860	All my friends gave it bad reviews. They went in there expecting like Spider-Man or Dark Knight.
8627300	8630660	It's its own own thing. No, this is R-rated, folks.
8631220	8634660	The movie ending doesn't make any sense. Yes, it does.
8634660	8636020	No, it doesn't. Did you read the comics?
8636020	8639860	Yes, I did. A difference of opinion.
8639860	8644900	It doesn't make any sense because. I will go see it and be the tie vote.
8644900	8648340	Without trying to explain too much of the ending of the movie.
8649700	8655380	It's because a certain character is aligned with a certain country and if that certain,
8655380	8659780	you know, thing happened, then everyone would blame the certain country and no world peace
8659780	8662900	would happen. It would just be all everybody against the one country.
8663540	8665700	Except that it happened within the one country too.
8665700	8667220	I'm so confused. It doesn't matter though.
8668020	8668820	Anyway. All right.
8669620	8673220	Another discussion. We should do a movie cast.
8673220	8674260	Someday. Maybe as a one-off.
8674260	8676100	We should call it ultimate spoiler cast.
8677140	8680580	All right. Ray, I got to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show,
8680580	8684980	but thanks so much. And I hope you had a good time on your first call and call again sometime. Okay.
8685620	8687060	All right. Sweet. I'll call back next week.
8687060	8689780	All right. Later. We may not be here next week, but in two weeks.
8690660	8691220	All right. Bye.
8691220	8691860	All right. Later.
8691860	8696180	All right. We like first time callers. That's a good note to end on tonight, I think. So
8696180	8698900	sorry guys who didn't get through. We're going to close up the Skypline for now.
8699460	8702740	You can always send us emails, mailbag orange launch, radio.com, or of course we will continue
8702740	8706100	to read chat comments throughout the night. We still have some last minute stories, dark soccer.
8706100	8709220	I'm sorry. We didn't get to you, but Hey, if I hadn't taken that call, it wouldn't have been
8709220	8712580	a first time caller. So I wouldn't have been burping.
8712580	8724820	Okay. So, um, there is a, uh, a marketing stunt that went kind of, uh, nuts and it was, um,
8724820	8730340	actually by monument PR, um, for Friday the 13th for the launch of resident evil five.
8730900	8736660	And the, basically the big stunt was a treasure hunt, um, where about 50, uh,
8736660	8743300	members of the public would go and retrieve arms, legs, heads, and torsos from a number of
8743300	8754740	different areas. Um, so, um, it was basically, um, part of, you know, like I said, part of the,
8754740	8761620	the big campaign. Um, so they, uh, hid all the body parts, um, within the square mile of London,
8761620	8770500	like, um, in bins and on window ledges and a hundred people signed up. Um, so, um, basically
8772740	8779220	it actually said that, um, the people paying attention to it, passers by complained to the
8779220	8785700	police and officers were there at the finishing line, um, to greet the people who are trying to
8785700	8792340	assemble bodies. So it's the whole thing. I read about this earlier on the weekend,
8792340	8796020	the whole thing sounded stupid and like, it did look kind of gross. Like, you know,
8796020	8800180	there's just certain things that, you know, you gotta wonder who the hell thought this was a good
8800180	8806980	idea, right? Maybe it was just me. I don't know. Loki. Well, thank you to our emailer and to Jamie
8806980	8811140	for that one. Loki, did you have anything tonight? Uh, just some small stuff. Um,
8811140	8819540	Watchmen, The End of Nigh 2 has been announced and apparently it is more of the same. However,
8819540	8825620	um, it's supposed to be a little bit racier. Apparently it's been rated by the ESRB and
8825620	8832100	describes, uh, some sexual content in there, including, um, nice. There's a, let's see here.
8833540	8837220	Uh, well basically the sexual content, I guess, is the more racier part.
8837220	8842900	Oh, I don't know the blue peen. Well, that's not necessarily in there. As a watch, I guess you'll,
8842900	8848580	um, fight in a strip club that includes, uh, go-go dancers in cages, peep show booths,
8848580	8855220	and a pornographic film in the background. However, um, in case you haven't played the
8855220	8860740	first Watchmen, The End of Nigh, it sucks. And so if it's more of the same, it's more of the suck.
8860740	8870260	So don't buy it. Or at least try the demo. Um, apparently Peter Moore of EA is saying that
8870260	8877380	Wii Motion Plus is going to put an end to lazy Wiimote gaming. Um, apparently the 1-1, uh, motion
8877380	8883540	capture that is part of, um, Wii Motion Plus requires you to actually make the full swing
8883540	8887220	when playing a golf game or tennis game. You can't just, like, move your wrists a little bit.
8887220	8891620	Which is great, because that'll encourage more people to throw stuff through their TV. Sweet.
8893060	8899060	Um, now of course we talked about earlier a free PopCap game you can get on St. Patty's Day,
8899060	8902900	but of course there's going to be some more stuff coming out as well, including Little Big Planet
8902900	8910660	is going to be giving away a free, um, St. Patty's Day costume. That'll include a beard,
8910660	8918660	a shiny green suit, a green top hat, and other stuff to make your character look like a leprechaun.
8919380	8925220	Um, also in April there's going to be another free costume that's a Monkey King costume.
8925220	8930340	Apparently it was the winning entry of the PlayStation Asia contest, the design costume
8930340	8935140	contest. And then there's some more paid costumes coming out later, including a Killzone mini pack,
8935140	8942500	Buzz mini pack, Patapon costume, and a Heavenly Sword mini pack as well. But I want some more
8942500	8947140	damn expansions, that's what I want. More stuff like Metal Gear Solid, because that's awesome.
8947940	8952420	And then finally, um, Resident Evil 5 is already going to get some download content.
8952420	8960660	The VS download content, it's been dated in Japan. It's going to be available for, um, 250 yen
8960660	8968020	and 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live. It is, um, apparently coming out in a few weeks.
8968740	8975220	And we'll add in some new online co-op modes, as well as some competitive online options.
8975220	8980420	Uh, I guess some four player, um, game modes and stuff like that as well. So that's kind of neat.
8980420	8984740	And I'm sure it'll be coming out over here around the same time. That is it.
8984740	8990580	All right. Lots and lots of last minute stuff, but it's been a little bit of a busy week. Well,
8990580	8994260	we're going to try to wrap things up and get on out of here for the evening. So we got to go
8994260	8998740	around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night. Um, brings us to the end of the show.
8998740	9004740	Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. Your final thought. Blarg. My final thought is Cherry 7-Up
9004740	9009540	is delicious. And I've had two cans tonight during the show. That can't be healthy. Loki,
9009540	9016660	your final thought. Um, my final thought is Pagel is fun. All right. That's going to do it. Thank
9016660	9020340	you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting independent radio. Remember,
9020340	9023780	if you like what you hear, we do this for free. We do it for fun. We do it for you.
9023780	9027860	Just tell two people you know about the show, help us spread the word because word of mouth is how
9027860	9034180	we are able to, um, you know, spread the word about our show. So that's it. We will be back
9034180	9039140	maybe next week. Stay tuned to the website for updates on the show. Uh, but for sure in two
9039140	9043220	weeks, we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. So until then, thank you guys. Have a great
