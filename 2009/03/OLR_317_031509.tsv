14019	15901	and I March 15, 2009.
16682	22608	GamePro goes game publisher, Call of Duty passes a landmark for online play, and which company is
31570	33612	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
34073	35875	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35915	41941	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42001	45745	And we tape live every Sunday night on allgames.com.
45785	47427	That's www.allgames.com.
48348	55512	All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show, about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on the West Coast, 9 o'clock Eastern for the East Coast.
56133	57673	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week.
58414	61516	Joining us also every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
61956	62436	How's it going?
63017	63857	I'm good.
63917	64998	How are you, Techmaster Loki?
65098	65538	Doing good.
65898	66719	All right, excellent.
67339	75284	And also joining us tonight, running fresh in from inside the house, live radio, say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers.
75344	75684	How are you doing?
76349	78270	I had beer last night and I feel good.
78370	78770	Did ya?
79271	79751	Congratulations.
79791	80531	Much beer was had.
80772	82492	But you always drink responsibly, correct?
82953	85334	Yep, that's why I have someone else be responsible for me.
85514	86154	Alright, excellent.
86535	93098	Alright, and of course, not only do we tape live on All Games Radio, but you can also watch our video feed on JustinTV.
93158	99742	Just before the show went live tonight, we were taking a peek at Mad World on the Nintendo Wii, which I guess has quickly become one of Loki's favorite games?
100142	100362	Yes.
100722	102743	And what is it about Mad World that you're loving?
103364	103804	Everything.
103824	104084	Everything.
104912	105452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
125748	126868	What was the Stephen King novel?
126888	127728	Except they were running.
127748	128488	That was the
155230	156271	That was the long walk, Rob.
173679	174019	MadWorld
196455	198256	is really what the graphics look like.
198276	200858	I think that's more black and white than occasionally red.
201158	201999	It's very red.
202159	205281	As it is, you know, the game would be awesome just with that.
205542	208524	But, oh no, Sega does not just stop there.
208724	211966	They decide that we need sports commentators as well, and who did they get?
212266	214027	Greg Proops and John DiMaggio.
214488	218390	John DiMaggio, you might remember as the voice of Bender, and Greg Proops from whose line?
219271	220312	They should have gotten Madden.
221679	223580	DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?
249370	250370	I played some Ragnarok.
250890	251671	That's really about it.
251751	257852	We've actually been having a different sort of gaming experience in my house, which is called cleaning out the vault.
259232	263693	I found so much E3 swag and no one wants any of it.
263733	264973	Guys, trust me, it's shit.
265994	271195	But we've been piling up our systems and realized that we have four Saturns, two ColecoVisions.
271835	272755	Dude, I want a Saturn.
274127	274828	Talk to my husband.
274848	275568	I have two Saturns.
275848	277870	I don't know why I would.
277890	279951	What would I play on the Saturn, seriously?
279971	285516	We're debating taking one of our systems and doing a giveaway with it and having us autograph it or something.
286516	287517	Who wants a ColecoVision?
287557	287777	Hey!
289919	291160	Good luck getting that shit to work.
291740	292441	No, it works just fine.
292461	293481	Does it really?
293661	297103	Can you even hook those up to newer TVs?
298104	298324	Yes.
298724	300425	They have the RCA.
300585	302286	Or not RCA, the RF.
302666	303566	Yeah, they have an RF.
304187	307848	But we also have two driving wheels.
308048	309489	So we'd have a spare driving wheel.
309909	311050	One of ours is Canadian.
312651	316813	We have my Super Nintendo, which was the very first system I bought with my own money.
318134	318874	That was cool.
319294	321816	And the person who owned it before me smoked because it's all yellow.
324958	327399	So yeah, we've got piles of stuff just hanging around.
328560	330401	And so, hey!
330421	333123	Alright, maybe a giveaway.
333223	333463	Maybe.
333703	340207	Maybe, but we did also... We have a stack of old strategy guides.
341188	342349	A number of them from the 80s.
343447	345268	Hey, some of that stuff goes for money on eBay.
345688	347729	We have How to Win at Castlevania.
349130	349690	That's funny.
350091	350331	Nice.
350811	352172	You win at Castlevania!
352272	353112	Bye, Dracula!
353252	354133	Woo, I get a car!
355926	358027	I'm going to also introduce the chat room right now at this time.
358087	361409	Chat.OrangeEntreter.com, always when we're taping live on Sunday nights.
362209	365871	The listener experience and getting to interact with the show is really what makes this show unique.
366651	369133	Just kind of reading some comments here from the chat room.
369793	372354	Tiger Claw says, Greg Proops is awesome.
372894	377236	Black Wolf points out, John DiMaggio is also the voice of Marcus Phoenix.
377817	382319	And he should have done it, I'm sorry, Quiltipo says, John DiMaggio should have done it in his Waka voice.
384332	384612	PagelDS
407836	412901	Why have I... You know, it's sad that I found Peggle now, because it is quite addicting.
412921	415965	Yeah, wait, I don't know why you're knocking it.
416165	416906	Isn't this a good thing?
416926	417747	I'm not knocking it.
417787	420750	I'm just saying, oh, Peg, there's something else to be addicted to.
420770	421831	Oh, okay, I gotcha.
422432	423292	No, it's actually kind of fun.
423773	425034	So, that's pretty cool.
425575	425695	And...
427202	428483	Have you checked out the one on Xbox yet?
428703	428823	No.
429324	432006	Okay, because I was going to ask you, how is it different on the DS?
432326	433687	Have you played any other version of Peggle?
433768	433868	No.
434168	435149	Okay, then never mind.
435169	435929	You can't answer my question.
435949	439452	I was going to ask, how is it different on the DS, but I guess you can't answer that.
439472	442155	It's not really that different, I don't think, from anything else.
442675	450021	Basically, you control it with the stylus to aim, and then when you hold the stylus in one spot, it'll zoom in, and then you can fine aim with that.
450301	450922	Oh, that's pretty cool.
451202	452964	And then you just tap a button, and it'll...
453624	453864	Shoot.
454124	454525	And that's it.
455345	459287	SSJ100Matt asks the wife test question, asking, would Nelly play Peggle?
459687	459948	Maybe.
460088	461028	I haven't shown it to her yet.
462389	465831	You've got cookies!
466611	473535	For those that are randomly yelling out, my roommate just popped in the studio here and has a really big smirk on his face.
473555	475436	I'm trying to figure out... Oh, boy.
475777	477618	Okay, John wants to speak on the show.
477878	479979	Did we give you a nickname on this show?
480719	480939	John?
481440	481820	My roommate?
481840	481920	What?
485410	487331	Okay, your secret nickname is Roommator John.
487351	488451	We've got to get you a mic here.
488651	490092	Your superhero name would be the roomie.
490792	491692	I'm going to make this short.
492353	497995	I don't usually play tons and tons of video games, but iPhone game app called Arvale.
498175	501316	Completely amazing, old school, Final Fantasy style game.
501716	505378	Haven't been able to stop playing it for like three days, and it's fantastic.
505838	509679	And I actually paid for the paid version, which is unspeakable and unheard of.
510200	511000	So that's my little plug.
513169	514029	How did you find this game?
514069	515350	Tell us a little more about how it plays.
515370	520312	Because this is unheard of that you actually want to participate in the show and about video games and not making fun of me.
520733	525275	So I definitely want to know a little bit more about how you found this and how it plays and all that.
525555	526836	How do you control it on an iPhone?
528178	529139	It's pretty simple.
529199	537065	There's a little action button for most things, and there's a little control pad, so it's left, right, up, down, diagonals.
538286	547332	Found it going through strategy games that were free on the iPhone, and liked it so much I bought the paid version.
547993	554658	It plays like an old school Final Fantasy, like maybe Final Fantasy V or so, I think, and...
557199	559120	Wait, am I filling in for Jamie?
559200	562962	Am I supposed to like grow tits tonight or be extra sassy?
564382	565563	She's just going to the loo, I think.
567844	570705	She's going to the soda, which is kind of like the loo.
571085	572826	Maybe we should keep the soda in the bathroom.
575014	577475	Okay, what else was I going to ask though?
577515	579575	Is this game available anywhere else that you know of?
579835	582696	Because some folks in our chat room are saying, I don't have an iPhone, so are they just screwed?
583677	587558	Then I would say that their life is incomplete and they need to go buy an iPhone.
588958	589958	These are obvious things.
590038	591879	I don't know why I'm having to tell your listeners this.
592839	594320	Apple thanks you for the free plug.
594380	594660	All right.
595541	595821	All right.
595841	598063	Well, thank you, John, for your contributions.
598123	599564	Wait, you forgot to wave to Justin TV.
599945	600565	They're very mad.
600585	604368	They had to look at your butt the whole time you were talking, and now they want some recognition.
604488	604728	All right.
605822	608884	Anyhow, Loki, I'm so sorry about that.
608904	611166	Anyway, that's okay, that's okay.
611947	617931	Other than PagleDS, I also played Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, which is interesting.
618111	622074	It's definitely a different take on Grand Theft... Well, not that different.
622095	623876	I mean, it's very similar to 1 and 2.
624416	631902	But, you know, having come off of 4 and Lost and Damned, it is kind of hard to go back to the 2D stuff.
632382	632763	But, or...
633323	633603	DarkSakura
659178	664161	And then other than DS stuff, I've also played, of course, more Lost and Damned.
665041	666662	Still lots of multiplayer in that.
667683	673626	Playing around with the glitch of the game, there's a spot where pedestrians spawn in the middle of the air and fall from the sky.
674127	674767	That's kind of fun.
676568	680190	And then I played a little bit of PS3 today.
680210	685053	I went ahead and finally got around to playing the little big Planet Contra levels.
685453	686254	So that was kind of fun.
687454	699063	and, um, I also went and played Noby Noby Boy for a few sec- I would say, yeah, a few seconds until Nelly's, like, that, like, bass sound when you're stretching is really fucking annoying.
699864	700885	So turn it off.
701605	703026	So I stopped playing that.
704027	704668	Um, which-
705928	706509	Yeah, pretty much.
706569	707250	She cracked the whip.
707270	710353	Then, of course, Mad World.
710733	713056	That game is awesome in all sorts of ways.
713736	719142	Unfortunately, I haven't really made it past the first level because I haven't gotten a chance to actually sit down and play it for a long enough time.
720924	723086	The first level is really cool, though, so I can't wait.
725862	726102	SuperMetroid 0
748806	749567	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
767686	768727	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
783925	793452	You know, you just have to imagine, for those, you know, I know not everybody lives where we live and knows this place, but it's a giant castle with a big golf course and a big water park that they're known for.
793792	798035	But it's just like they let little kids just run the frickin' place because of it.
798375	800237	And, of course, they don't know how to treat machines.
800317	804560	Parents don't know how to police their children in a place like that, so the machines... And they change their diapers on the machines.
804580	804780	Oh, yeah.
804840	805160	Oh, God.
805180	807702	And if you think she's lying, that's a completely true story.
808082	810324	A diaper was once changed on a keyboard mania machine.
810344	813646	But regardless, the machines run down, broken, blah.
813967	816916	But we heard they got a Beatmania 2DX machine so we had to go check it out.
817137	817659	And you know what?
818553	825976	We went, and I hadn't been in like a year, 18 months or so, and color me shocked, but the place looked really nice.
826336	843582	Like, they remodeled or something, they did some repainting in there, I didn't find a machine that was broken, everything looked to be in a good state, I mean, granted, I saw Supernova 2, the monitor was a little junky, but honestly, considering all the parts worked, the Max 2 pads worked great, 2DX was in awesome condition, um...
844042	845003	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
867222	869464	because the place was in a good state.
869484	877892	So I played Beatmania 2DX Distorted, which I'd played before because I had it at E3 a few years ago, but I haven't really touched Beatmania 2DX in a long time.
877952	886059	It's been a long, long time, probably since this show took a more general gaming approach as opposed to just music video games that we used to do.
887040	887821	But I've missed it.
888061	888521	It was fun.
888741	891724	Granted, I found myself playing all old songs, but...
892745	894366	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
916838	920802	So yeah, the machine was nice and loud because you could turn the effectors on and all that.
920822	923083	So tell them about, was it Guitar Hero Arcade?
923124	925526	Yes, they had Guitar Hero Arcade, which I played.
925946	928588	I only played it once, so I can't really give a full review on it.
928648	932652	I can just tell you I got pissed off because Roseville Golf Line also switched to cards.
932692	934073	They don't use tokens anymore, but cards.
934413	940859	And when I was swiping the card through and everything, I somehow hit the button an extra time to start the game, and I accidentally got on easy mode.
941079	943341	And you can't switch it once you're on easy mode.
943781	960697	But to me, honestly, it just looked like the freaking home game, except a smaller song list, and it was just basically Guitar Hero 3 with a slightly smaller song list, and prettier because there's lights on the machine, and it spins around, and the TV they use is very, very crisp.
961137	963679	It is a very sharp image, but I don't know.
963699	966302	Would you want to pay a dollar a game for something you can get at home?
966903	967203	You know.
968004	970266	But I understand there is an audience for this thing.
970306	972929	And it's kind of cool to go out and play with your friends and all that stuff.
972969	975091	So I can see where this machine might do decent.
975131	979056	But if you have Guitar Hero at home, I don't see the point in this game.
980057	980377	Honestly.
981538	981619	Um...
983126	987067	Let's see, what else did I do in my gaming week this week?
988327	993488	I played the demo of The Last Remnant on the PC, and I was a little disappointed at how choppy it was.
993528	1000130	And I just bought this PC back in August, so I know it's not like old parts or anything, but I was a little disappointed at how choppy it was.
1000170	1005811	But the game itself seemed kind of fun, so I might try to check it out on Xbox 360, although the PC one was supposed to have all the extra stuff.
1007071	1008793	Peggle on Xbox Live Arcade.
1009314	1013179	I downloaded and played for a while, and good times.
1013219	1014781	I was already addicted to the one online.
1015202	1017405	It's sparkles and rainbows and Plinko.
1017645	1018506	It's fun.
1019588	1022892	I need to play some more of the multiplayer, though, before I can give my full impressions on that.
1023593	1026014	I had fun playing Pagel and I think a lot of people are going to check this out.
1026054	1036920	What I like about Pagel versus PopCap's other efforts on Xbox Live such as Bejeweled 2 and Zuma is that this doesn't just feel like a port of their PC game, the full one.
1037260	1044444	It feels like they've really tinkered some stuff to work with Xbox Live, hence the multiplayer, and they've really kind of made it special for Xbox Live.
1044464	1046185	And I think that's what's kind of cool about Pagel.
1046205	1047286	It makes it really stand out.
1047726	1048607	Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3
1064341	1066402	was on sale, so I figured, what the heck?
1066422	1072685	I picked it up, I bought it, because I got a new dance mat for Xbox, whatever, and got to play Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3.
1072965	1077348	Do you want to know what the most hilarious thing about Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 is?
1079209	1084892	On the back of the box, they advertise these songs that are in the game, one of them being Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.
1085952	1087693	So I was like, okay, I want to check that song out.
1088113	1089194	It's not in the game.
1090954	1095678	In fact, of all the songs that are mentioned on the back of the box, apparently only one of them is actually in the game.
1095779	1096419	And no, it's not.
1096699	1100242	Like, I looked on web forums, DDR Freak, which is still kicking after all these years.
1100563	1100823	Who knew?
1101383	1105467	DDR Freak apparently confirms these songs are not in the game.
1105908	1107249	But they're advertised on the back of the box.
1107269	1108550	Well, that's false advertising.
1108650	1109110	I know.
1109150	1110271	I say we sue Konami.
1110792	1111532	What's up with that?
1111793	1112814	We'll turn it around on him.
1113806	1120270	Look, I understand mistakes happen and all, but this is a pretty fucking big mistake.
1120791	1121391	You know what I mean?
1122452	1122812	I don't know.
1122932	1125794	I'm surprised they're not trying to send out stickers.
1126194	1128096	How does something like that happen?
1128576	1130277	Who fucked up that bad?
1130677	1131698	It's been out for a while.
1131718	1133339	They probably just figured no one has noticed.
1134440	1135100	My God.
1136281	1143564	But look, the game itself, putting the box aside and all that trite crap, the game itself is okay.
1143724	1145885	It's not my favorite home version of a DDR game.
1145905	1148126	In fact, I think I even preferred the song list in Universe 1.
1148686	1150207	It's definitely no Ultramix 2.
1151387	1152328	But it's not bad.
1152828	1159271	The interface is pretty slick, very crisp, very vibrant graphics, funny background animations.
1159651	1162953	2DX Fan Service 2DX Fan Service 2DX Fan Service 2DX Fan Service 2DX Fan Service
1190856	1192097	Also, I thought it was strange.
1192137	1195099	The download content, the interface, you can't preview the songs.
1195159	1197941	I'd never heard of any of them, so I don't know what I want to download.
1197961	1199823	Do they even have download content?
1199943	1200363	Yeah, they do.
1200643	1210991	My Universe 1 songs, though, did not come into Universe 3, but apparently there's a Universe pack available, so I'm not sure if it's trying to make me re-buy the songs I already bought with Universe 1, and if that's the case, that's kind of crappy.
1212418	1213199	Thanks for watching!
1228737	1230578	That's how the dialogue has gone.
1230658	1233319	You know, like the whole yo dog type stuff.
1233379	1236461	Like, you know, the, oh, everybody, you know, it's just bad.
1236481	1238221	Dialogue by Randy Jackson.
1238802	1239742	Yeah, it's bad.
1241363	1243804	Leo Shen asks, was the quest mode like you got served, Sky?
1243884	1244524	No, it's weird.
1244584	1253989	It's like this big circular thing and you go to these different places and in the first circle you gain coins to challenge people in the second circle and if you beat them you get the song.
1254389	1256250	It wasn't incredibly difficult, but
1256950	1262376	I unlocked the entire second circle in one night, but now it won't let me go to the third circle because I haven't played enough in the first circle.
1262757	1264358	I don't want to play the easy stuff, but whatever.
1266440	1269263	And eventually you'll get to the seventh ring of hell.
1270649	1271970	It's just like, here's the thing.
1272050	1275812	I don't want to necessarily give this game a negative review because I don't think it's necessarily bad.
1275913	1279775	And I do encourage people to play DDR because I think it's a way to stay fit and exercise.
1280115	1282177	And, you know, again, I think everything's pretty sharp.
1282537	1285139	I don't necessarily like some of the creative direction they took in it.
1285179	1287300	I don't think the new quest mode is anything that exciting.
1287780	1289902	I don't think the new interface is that great.
1290002	1295485	I think having the giant CD cover box art thing in the wheels is a bit much.
1296626	1297427	I don't go for
1297827	1302749	I'm telling you, if you make me the production director of this series, I could bring it around like nothing.
1304490	1308712	It's not necessarily bad, it's just another DDR game.
1309453	1312034	At this point, these things are a dime a dozen.
1312474	1318497	I really want to see the DDR teams at Konami really try to reinvent this stuff.
1319478	1324200	For love of God, whoever made that big mistake about putting songs on there that weren't actually in the game, that was a
1325848	1329571	I mean, that just kind of speaks as to how lazy they're getting.
1330692	1338859	You know, I'm like, it's not necessarily a big deal, okay, so somebody made a mistake, whatever, but it just speaks volume as to how lazy it feels like they're getting with DDR.
1339219	1342702	And which is sad because I know there's a lot of people that work very hard on this series.
1342722	1345985	You know, I've had friends who worked for the series that worked very hard on it.
1346065	1348927	It's some of these creative things coming up from the top level.
1348947	1351609	I'm surprised they didn't make a big deal about that, I mean, everywhere.
1351629	1353671	Because usually, I mean, hell, they made a big deal out of
1354371	1356953	The IGN watermark being on the Okami cover.
1357173	1361036	And that was something really stupid and small and had no impact really on the game.
1363638	1363958	I don't know.
1364018	1370342	And then there was Super Stardust Portable that was missing modes and stuff that were advertised on there.
1370742	1375566	I mean, this is kind of a big deal that there's songs missing from the game that are advertised on there.
1375586	1378528	Because that right there, say if you bought it for that song...
1379315	1379515	DarkSakura,
1396269	1396830	Thanks for watching!
1418570	1420392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1442990	1444371	because they just don't care anymore.
1444631	1456858	It's like shifting your focus to actually increase your market share with groups of people that don't normally play your games and ignoring your core players and thinking they're just going to stick around is not the way to be thinking.
1457539	1458859	Here's my challenge.
1458879	1468185	This is my last thing I want to say because I know there are people at Konami that listen to this program, and I'm not just talking about people that are like my personal friends and what have you, but I know there's people higher up.
1468946	1473249	Look, less than three is one of the songs in freaking DDR Universe 3.
1473290	1477573	The same song that was a theme song to Rice Princess' show she had on the old station, okay?
1478034	1483198	If that doesn't prove somebody at Konami is looking out for us, I don't know what does, okay?
1483579	1484900	Here's the thing I want to say to y'all.
1485340	1485521	Look.
1486141	1486981	I love DDR.
1487101	1489082	DDR has introduced me to a lot of great people.
1489102	1489963	I would not know Loki.
1490003	1492083	I would not know DarkSakura if it were not for DDR.
1492444	1496865	However, that being said, do not throw away a good thing.
1496905	1499386	Do not be afraid to reinvent yourselves.
1499447	1507430	And I challenge you, step away from making, resist the temptation of doing a Universe 4 or X2 or Disney 3.
1508390	1511932	I want you to nuke your code and start from the ground up.
1512112	1515273	Build a new DDR game from the ground up.
1515533	1516674	No recycled code.
1516974	1520575	Make a brand new DDR game and really try to push the limits of what you're doing with it.
1520635	1526378	I think you would really stand to win back a lot of people that are starting to think you're getting a little lazy.
1526578	1529759	They did it before and what did it do for the community for a while?
1529779	1534481	I mean, it really rejuvenated everything when we got the Max series.
1534521	1535462	Remember when it was new?
1535902	1544547	and honestly, DDR Ultramix, especially 2, not so much Ultramix 1, but Ultramix 2 when they really were getting in their groove, no pun intended, sold me on an Xbox.
1544847	1545308	It really did.
1545568	1548430	And that was all new code because they had to make it for the Xbox.
1548530	1552712	Well, also the other thing too, I think, is the way that they're treating their series.
1552732	1556595	I mean, look at Pump It Up and the new versions of that game.
1556635	1558276	There's a lot of excitement behind it.
1558316	1559716	They bring it out and it's like, BAM!
1559756	1560397	It's a new game.
1560437	1560977	It's awesome.
1560997	1561958	It's got all these things in it.
1562258	1563479	And people get excited about it, but
1564199	1571603	DDR, it's like, ah, new DDR, hooray, this time it's got more Disney characters, hurrah.
1573044	1576526	It's just that no one cares anymore, and they need to really change it up.
1576586	1588213	I'm serious, I have a way to fix this, but no one wants to listen, and I don't feel like explaining it because, well, it's just, it's all in my head, and unfortunately I can't put it on paper very, you know, but I can explain it the...
1589164	1600020	basically the whole quest mode thing taking a totally different approach to that basically you have stuff that goes along because the problem with quest mode is they don't know how to make it where
1601198	1601838	It actually matters.
1601878	1606141	I mean, you can't obviously do it as like a dance-off competition thing because that doesn't make any sense.
1606521	1609803	It's just, you can't do that in DDR because it's a technical game.
1609863	1612504	It's not based on, you know, doing moves and that kind of crap.
1613025	1621829	But if you make it something different, like say, for example, how well you're doing a song affects the performance of, say, something else that's going on.
1622190	1628253	Totally separate things, you know, just basically instead of, you know, your actions on a gamepad or something like that,
1628533	1628974	Thanks for watching!
1644943	1645543	Thank you for watching!
1666758	1667818	Try it for the exercise alone.
1668699	1669019	Let's see.
1669979	1670540	Comments from chat.
1670620	1671960	Floatwalk says, Two words.
1672100	1673301	National tournament.
1673621	1674981	That's definitely what Pump It Up does.
1675201	1677682	The tournaments they do in Korea are huge.
1678803	1682965	And Floatwalk says, For crying out loud, the tournament scene made DDR's popularity in the States.
1683365	1684025	True facts.
1685145	1688707	Acidic Vampire says, What DDR needs is violence like Mad World.
1689547	1690808	DDR does not need violence.
1691088	1693269	At least not that level of violence.
1693349	1693629	I mean...
1694788	1697330	No, it doesn't need that.
1697830	1702792	But I do agree that you could take the quest mode and literally make it like an RPG type thing.
1705594	1706214	I don't know.
1708335	1709476	No, no, no.
1709556	1713238	I will tell you a reason why RPG stuff will never work with Dance Dance Revolution.
1713698	1717300	It all goes back to a little known game called Dance Dance Dance.
1718561	1718821	No.
1720262	1721362	I think I remember that game.
1721543	1723263	Yes, I've played it and yes, it sucks.
1725003	1725263	All right.
1725343	1727104	Anyhow, let's move on.
1727204	1732627	I don't want to spend too much time reminiscing the old days, although that's kind of what I did this week by going to Golfland.
1732647	1733087	So there you go.
1734628	1734868	All right.
1735809	1738050	Since that does it for our gaming week, let's get to some housekeeping.
1738090	1738350	All right.
1738390	1742733	So look, we've sat here and kind of been critical of DDR for the last few minutes.
1742793	1744033	But I will say this.
1744174	1747515	At our heart, we do love Konami and so on.
1748376	1752258	On our website, www.orangeentrader.com, there actually have been polling –
1752958	1769164	all of our listeners all week long about your top three favorite Konami games since their 40th birthday is coming up and we're giving them a present now with this week long feature of the best games as selected by you guys the listeners from Konami's archives 1500 Konami games over the years if you can believe it
1770824	1774246	Speaking of voting, March Madness is almost over.
1774306	1775767	It's down to the final four.
1776007	1778648	And right now you have Rock Band versus Super Mario Bros.
1779148	1778648	3.
1779608	1783050	And you have Chrono Trigger versus Zelda Link to the Past.
1783450	1786311	And I believe voting time is going to be up very, very soon.
1786351	1790793	So if you're listening live here on this Sunday evening, you're going to want to go try to get in your last minute votes.
1790954	1793375	And the final two will probably be decided tonight.
1794475	1796918	March 22nd, next week.
1797658	1800541	I'm not going to be here, so I'm not sure if there's going to be a show or not.
1801081	1804204	Stay tuned to our website, www.orangeandrade.com for more details.
1804264	1808428	I think they might try to find a way to tape elsewhere, but I will not be here next week.
1808529	1811912	I'm going to be on a trip, but I will be back in two weeks, so we'll keep you posted.
1812753	1814855	All right, that's really it for housekeeping.
1814895	1816096	Just stay tuned to our website.
1816196	1817797	Actually, I want to say something about the website real fast.
1817937	1818998	Actually, I...
1820437	1821238	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1840658	1850026	But, you know, they've been writing articles about indie game spotlights, games you ought to be playing but you probably aren't, and highlighting music from video games.
1850486	1853889	And it's been actually really cool to kind of go to the site and see this stuff.
1853929	1857973	And what I love about it is that, in a way, it's because we're not doing it.
1858053	1863758	It's like, you know, kind of what the show is all about, letting the listeners have control and the community and what the community wants to hear about.
1863818	1867361	So props to you guys who've all been working hard on the website.
1867481	1868822	It's been pretty awesome.
1869302	1876706	and I have an idea for a feature too that I'm hoping to contribute very soon and I'll be back on posting regular updates very soon.
1877686	1879647	Okay, now I think that's it for housekeeping.
1879687	1881068	Let's get into some gaming news.
1881088	1882568	We're only like 30 minutes into the show.
1882969	1883569	Let's get to it.
1884449	1885970	Loki, start us off with some gaming news.
1886230	1895895	Yes, so anyways, there has been some concern by MTV's Totillo that
1897321	1903024	There might not be enough exclusives during 2009 for the Xbox 360.
1903464	1915671	Now, unfortunately what Steven doesn't realize is that there are, but he just doesn't understand that there are a lot of things coming out that people think that aren't exclusive, are exclusive, and that they think that are exclusive that aren't exclusive.
1915711	1916672	So it's kind of confusing.
1917572	1922715	For example, he says the loss of Xbox exclusive franchises like Mass Effect...
1924048	1925509	Thanks for watching!
1942714	1944095	Project Gotham Racing Project Gotham Racing
1972837	1978178	And of course, there's also Halo 3 ODST, or whatever they're calling it now.
1980019	1981899	And I mean, that's just for right now.
1982640	1987601	Obviously, they haven't really been talking much about their 2009 lineup, which they're probably saving for E3.
1987681	1992382	They're just going to be like, bam, bam, bam, bam, here's all this shit that's coming out.
1993422	1997304	Do you think they are going to, at E3, just blow us away?
1998324	1998384	Um...
1999224	1999584	Maybe.
2000284	2008727	I can kind of see where this guy has some concerns for Xbox 360 because they don't have a big Halo 3 this year or anything of that caliber.
2008927	2010908	Granted, you had Halo Wars, but it's not the same thing.
2011748	2014129	There's no big, big must-have title.
2014149	2015690	It feels like we got a lot of that last year.
2016570	2018891	Well, they're not going to let us down with just...
2020509	2020969	Thanks for watching!
2040834	2041334	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2062881	2063541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2083130	2087153	Bioshock 2 is going to be a huge Christmas title, but it's not specific to any system.
2107125	2111847	Yeah, well, I think it actually is going to be coming out in August, just like it did the first time.
2112127	2117389	But there's tons of stuff coming out that we don't know about yet that are going to be big titles.
2117489	2124712	And I'm sure that each side, both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, are both going to have exclusive titles that are going to be really awesome.
2125232	2133355	So I don't really think it matters about the exclusive titles because there's just more titles coming out on the Xbox 360 right now.
2134216	2134516	Period.
2136058	2137339	Game Developers Conference
2154927	2155187	Oh, yeah.
2155227	2157989	Yeah, so, I mean, there's going to be announcements probably there as well.
2158149	2159529	I mean, there's lots of stuff.
2159629	2162751	And not only that, but they're not only focusing on just console stuff.
2162771	2166153	I mean, you've got XNA, which is really hitting its strides now.
2166613	2167734	Xbox Live Arcade.
2168914	2169955	Who knows what they're going to go with.
2169995	2173337	I don't think a Game Developers Conference, though, you're going to get huge game announcements.
2173417	2176218	But I think you'll get, like, infrastructure type things.
2176258	2179300	Like, remember, Game Developers Conference was where, like, Home was announced.
2179400	2179820	That was a...
2180220	2192151	I don't think that was announced at Game Developers Conference, but I could see that being the type of thing.
2192211	2194653	Things that affect the developers.
2194693	2198517	Things that affect the backbones of these systems are the types of announcements I would expect to see.
2198597	2199818	Upgrades and things of that note.
2200278	2204022	Maybe this would be a great time for Nintendo to finally put out that SD card thing they've been talking about.
2204773	2205353	That would be great.
2205593	2207454	I've got a 2GB card right here.
2208014	2210095	Right here, just waiting to go in the Wii.
2211515	2212576	To store all my crap.
2215116	2216797	So, I'm hoping that thing will come out soon.
2218017	2219058	Alright, well, there will be...
2220484	2221124	Actually, wait, I gotta read.
2221144	2222485	There will be some comments from chat right now.
2222525	2223525	That's the one I gotta read right now.
2224225	2227206	Acidic Vampire is betting at E3 this year.
2227326	2231608	Microsoft will reveal that Final Fantasy XIII Versus will be on the Xbox 360.
2233568	2234088	I doubt that.
2234929	2235289	You never know.
2235809	2241331	GameGuru says Microsoft at E3 will announce that the best non-Sony games that are appearing on PlayStation 3 will also be on the Xbox 360.
2242914	2248218	Amaze Satsuma corrects me and says Microsoft did Gears 2 was announced at Game Developers Conference.
2248278	2251360	So it is not unheard of for games to be announced at Game Developers Conference.
2251401	2253562	Yeah, because they're talking about the enhancements to Unreal 3.
2255223	2255784	That stuff.
2257065	2259026	You might hear something about Unreal 4 maybe.
2259046	2259366	I don't know.
2259386	2260407	That may be interesting.
2260427	2260828	That could be.
2262869	2268613	Maybe some stuff from about Doom 4 because I think they're going to be talking about that and probably Rage a little bit.
2269414	2271255	What was I going to say though?
2273120	2276361	Yeah, the whole rumor thing about Final Fantasy Versus.
2277061	2280542	Square's kind of already done that with Xbox 360.
2280582	2285503	If you notice, the last few games that they've put out have been only on Xbox 360 and have been exclusive.
2285623	2289564	Star Ocean, Last Hope, The Last Remnant.
2289584	2293745	Before that... Oh gosh, I'm forgetting now.
2294145	2297806	But yeah, a lot of their RPGs are going to be strictly...
2299096	2301879	on the Xbox 360, but now they're going to start getting some PS3 ones.
2301919	2303221	Infinite Undiscovered?
2303261	2304802	Yeah, Infinite Undiscovered, that's what I was thinking.
2305363	2306324	Stuff I did not buy.
2309215	2309535	I don't know.
2310015	2314456	There's going to be a lot of companies that are going to be developing for them because it's easier to develop on that platform.
2315116	2324998	Unless Sony figures out a way to educate these guys a lot faster and figure out how to develop for a lot easier, that's going to be the problems they're going to face.
2325078	2329919	Right now, being this far into the console cycle, it's probably not going to change.
2329959	2332980	We'll just have to wait for the next round and we'll see how it goes there.
2333416	2334056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2358183	2361504	But they still have yet to really just break through and be massive over there.
2362045	2364926	Maybe this will help because the Japanese love their shmups.
2365546	2365986	Shoot them up.
2366246	2366566	Shmup.
2367187	2370288	This one is called Mamoru-kun Has Been Cursed.
2370368	2371929	That would be the English translation of this title.
2372349	2374150	It is coming out on the Xbox 360.
2374630	2379032	It's going to come with a soundtrack CD and a Super Play DVD.
2379152	2381313	That's a limited edition that's coming on the Xbox 360.
2381633	2383073	Coming out for 8,500 yen.
2383193	2385134	But if you want the regular edition, it's 5,980 yen.
2387335	2388876	Now let me tell you a little bit about this game here.
2388896	2395638	It's been developed by G-Rev, and apparently it has character designs in it by Mizuki Takayama.
2396279	2399620	He did some other famous shoot-'em-up games.
2400260	2402421	This is actually a translation of an arcade game.
2403041	2404322	It looks like you play a little dude.
2404342	2408604	You're not actually a ship, but it looks like you're actually a little person that's walking around, kind of doing the fighting.
2408944	2410204	So, kind of interesting.
2410985	2414646	It's about an elementary school student who finds themselves in a nightmarish underworld.
2414706	2415326	So it definitely looks...
2416747	2417207	Kind of cool.
2417667	2428591	The interesting thing, though, about these shoot-'em-ups, they don't translate well for widescreen systems because, you know, shoot-'em-ups are usually very vertical-oriented and you can't really turn your TV on its side, so you only end up using a very small portion of the screen.
2428611	2430572	You can if you have a really kick-ass mounting setup.
2430632	2433293	That's true, but people don't usually have that.
2433553	2438035	Well, my husband's new monitor, the widescreen HDMI, has access to Pivoton.
2439396	2444998	And actually a lot more that you're finding these days are built to shift position.
2445138	2451181	And I think some of the games, even the Xbox Live Arcade games like Ikaruga, I think did support that as well.
2451201	2453122	We have a few Saturn games that actually will let you do that.
2453162	2455443	I think one of the Thunder Blade games will do it.
2457284	2465709	Well, just to give you an idea of some of the other things that G-Rev has developed, because it's coming out here, they did do some work with Ikaruga and Gradius V, just so you know.
2465749	2476995	They did some programming and background graphic design for Ikaruga, and same thing for Gradius V. So, you know, they have touched those games, and they've also done some work with Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker, which is an old school Dreamcast game.
2478236	2478716	So there you go.
2479717	2481318	This game, a shmup coming out in Japan.
2481378	2484680	No word if it's coming out over here, although I gotta be honest, probably not.
2485549	2487553	How about we shift gears a little bit?
2487813	2488514	Ah ha ha!
2488995	2490858	Cause it's Gears of War 2 patches!
2491780	2492782	Isn't that fun, Rob?
2493643	2493964	Cool!
2494813	2498335	Well, there's going to be a premium map pack called Snowblind.
2498415	2505880	It's coming out on March 31st, and it'll have three new maps and a remake of Fuel Depot from the first Gears of War.
2506841	2515606	And it's supposed to bring in experience-based ranking and rebalance the gameplay a bit more, try to give everyone a better sense of progression.
2517627	2522310	And you'll still be using the true skill system, but it's sort of background now.
2523671	2528272	It's really just something to make people feel more rewarded for how well they do.
2530153	2534534	So you can earn your experience in matches that will get you through 100 levels.
2535354	2540095	You get milestones for each level, I think, each certain level that you get.
2540115	2544356	So you get an achievement for it, as well as, of course, the packs.
2544416	2546616	So there's a possibility of getting another 250 gamer score points.
2549057	2563043	There's an auto-balancing feature that will put a bot in place if you fall out during mid-match, although you also get an XP penalty, and it will correct scoring issues.
2566564	2575268	So there's no real price on the map pack yet, but as comparison, the combustible map pack is 800 Microsoft points.
2579309	2583470	The maps that are coming with this, one's called Grindyard.
2584511	2588392	That's a wintery junkyard processing plant thing.
2588812	2591553	It's supposed to be a spiritual successor to Gridlock.
2592114	2598896	There's Underhill and Courtyard also, in addition to the Fuel Depot remake.
2599937	2600357	Very nice.
2601417	2603258	And Actdeft approves in our chatroom.
2603298	2606179	Fuel Depot was the best map of the first Gears of War, says Actdeft.
2606803	2608404	That's probably why they're bringing it back.
2608424	2610646	That's probably why it's coming back for another round.
2610746	2611266	Absolutely.
2611286	2612007	I like it.
2612247	2612928	Okay, here.
2613468	2614049	Yay.
2614229	2618032	And, of course, people are going to be excited that they can increase their gamer score by another 250 points.
2618172	2619192	Here goes your EP.
2619232	2622215	Well, I just want to say my EP hit a landmark today.
2622355	2622835	Just today.
2623356	2625657	I crossed 10,000 gamer score today.
2625737	2626218	Woo-hoo.
2626758	2627679	and I'll see you next time.
2648520	2655504	So, apparently, there's a good use for some of your Xbox 360 systems that may be broken.
2656905	2662009	One use, of course, would be to convert it into a bong, and that's what someone has done, actually.
2662069	2665832	They have converted their Xbox 360 system into a bong.
2665972	2674398	Obviously, it doesn't work anymore, and I'm sure it's been gutted, but yes, now it is a bong, and you can smoke out of it.
2675572	2675972	Awesome.
2676453	2678614	But of course you would only smoke tobacco out of it, right?
2678634	2680615	Of course, because anything else would be illegal.
2681555	2684897	Because, you know, everybody smokes tobacco out of bongs.
2686158	2686598	Right.
2686958	2693662	Actually, I do know people who actually will do tobacco in a bong, but you can only do ginseng and other stuff.
2693682	2695022	Is that like a hookah type thing?
2695042	2698484	Yeah, it's pretty much like just a modified hookah, but it's the same difference.
2699825	2703007	But I'm looking at the picture of it and...
2705143	2706283	I would do better with that.
2706743	2709564	I mean, would you really want to turn your Xbox 360 of all things into a bong?
2709604	2711024	I'd be calling it the Xbox 420.
2711144	2715545	Well, to be honest, you wouldn't have to necessarily have an Xbox 360.
2715585	2719045	You could buy a replacement case and it's like, just buy a bong.
2719085	2723406	I mean, seriously, it's just, it's not even worth, you know, just getting a hookah.
2724866	2725887	It's like, why bother?
2725967	2728547	You know, why bother other than, oh, look, I did that.
2728607	2729027	Okay, great.
2729307	2731348	Now one person's converted their system into a bong.
2731588	2733568	No one else needs to do it because it's a waste of time.
2735237	2737579	Am I the only person here who's reminded of Dennis Leary?
2738861	2739281	How so?
2739601	2742924	Saying that smoking pot doesn't lead to other drugs, it leads to carpentry?
2744846	2745346	Perhaps.
2746528	2750151	AcidicVampire in chat says, if you use your 360 as a bong, you will see Yaris.
2751392	2752013	This is possible.
2752093	2752953	This is very possible.
2753234	2753594	That would...
2754815	2755555	All right, well, look, look.
2755655	2757476	Don't turn your 360 into a bong.
2757516	2760577	Get it to work again so that you can get new games on it.
2760637	2765179	Although this game is not on the 360, but it's a developer that makes a lot of games for 360.
2765259	2768400	PopCap is giving away a free game.
2768940	2770500	That's right, a free game.
2771681	2773661	It's actually a belief going on right now.
2773761	2774562	It's kind of like a St.
2774602	2775842	Patrick's Day promotion.
2776502	2778543	It's going to go through March 24th.
2779163	2781124	The game you can get is Big Money.
2781804	2784586	You can get the game for free on PopCap.
2785246	2785987	So go check it out.
2786027	2786447	Big money.
2786867	2790049	Kind of like the game Pop It, if you've ever played it with the balloons.
2790069	2792531	You're basically trying to make...
2793584	2798647	You know, like four of the same color that touch and it has a money theme going to it.
2799768	2801909	It's just like the balloon game if you ever played it.
2801949	2804530	Oh no, don't you click them away in this one?
2804570	2808432	When you see matches of four, you click on it and then they go away and everything compresses together.
2808693	2809393	I think that's this one.
2809433	2810934	That's how the balloon one is.
2812395	2812735	There it is.
2813786	2818189	You click on them and then it compresses together and you don't want it to go past the top of the screen.
2818209	2819950	I've played this before, like a long time ago.
2820651	2822172	But it's free, so now I can go play it again.
2822532	2822892	Unlimited.
2823052	2824413	But I have to get it before the 24th.
2824693	2825434	So, check it out.
2827153	2827673	DarkSakura.com
2851260	2854701	Didn't Rhapsody already come out?
2854741	2855081	I don't know
2881209	2890244	Rhapsody, A Musical Adventure on DS, The Last Remnant on PC, The Wheelman on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
2891285	2891686	That's it.
2892766	2895788	The US doesn't have much coming out, unfortunately, this week.
2896769	2910279	Starting things off, of course, we have on the DS, and I think this held over from last week, but World Championship Games, the track and field event, it got delayed to Monday.
2911320	2912560	And that's on the DS.
2912901	2917244	Also, Valkyrie Profile, Covenant of the Plume, also coming out on Monday on the DS.
2918365	2918465	Um...
2919522	2925304	Tuesdays when we have most of the stuff coming out, including another DS game, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars.
2926384	2932806	Also on the DS, Henry Hatsworth and a Puzzling Adventure, which is pretty cool, kind of combines puzzle and platforming there.
2933967	2937668	Also on the DS, Mind, Body, and Soul, Big World Puzzle Book.
2940013	2944475	On another Nintendo platform, the Wii, we have Ready to Rumble Revolution.
2945215	2948817	Also, Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 on the Wii as well.
2950937	2953399	Also have Rune Factory Frontier.
2955099	2956700	And some more DS titles.
2957120	2959021	We have on the DS and PSP, Scrabble.
2960302	2962723	On PlayStation 2, SingStar Queen.
2964263	2964544	Nice.
2964744	2966805	Also on the DS, Suikoden Tikris.
2968444	2984220	um Trackmania DS also on the DS and on the Wii Crayola Adventures Colorful World wow that sounds awesome not awesomely bad awesomely bad yes um
2985802	2990365	Let's see, this week on Xbox Live Arcade, we're supposed to be getting Hasbro Family Game Night.
2992427	2995709	Also on DS, SBK08, Superbike World Championship.
2996670	2998571	On PC, a few things.
2998671	3013001	The Path, Runes of Magic, Grand Ages Rome, Aether Saga Online, Tom Clancy's Hawks, and Woman's Murder Club, A Darker Shade of Grey.
3013641	3014242	Oh, and Men of War.
3015694	3016074	That's it.
3016234	3018596	Pretty kind of lame release week.
3018916	3020517	Oh, and on PSP, how could I forget this?
3020817	3022098	I was actually going to play this.
3022158	3023499	Resistance Retribution.
3024439	3026340	Can't wait to check out the linking stuff on that.
3026480	3029722	Actually, I can't wait to finish Resistance 2 since I haven't really played much of that.
3030603	3031643	Hey, quick question for you.
3031703	3034985	Completely random, but since you know about games that are in demand and all that stuff.
3035786	3037707	What's up with the Retro Game Challenge?
3037727	3041829	I tried to go to Best Buy to get it the other day and they said they had none in stock and they weren't expecting any more.
3041929	3043650	Is this a hard to find game now?
3043670	3043930	I guess so.
3045131	3048392	It's Atlas, so Atlas puts out their games in very limited quantities.
3049472	3053693	And a lot of these places think it's going to be too niche of a title, and so they don't bring it in.
3054593	3057554	And then people start asking for it, and then you can't find it.
3058634	3059095	Interesting.
3059715	3063096	I know, because I actually was hearing Bobby say good things about it last week, and he's not the only one.
3063136	3068397	Some of my other friends are talking about how they enjoyed Retro Game Challenge, so I was actually going to pick it up on the DS, and then I can't find it.
3069392	3070653	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3091509	3093110	How about the Nintendo Wii?
3093230	3094670	Now you get some stuff for Japan.
3094770	3103593	Darts Wii Deluxe, Monopoly Here and Now, the World Edition, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 All Play, and Winter Sports 2009 The Next Challenge.
3103673	3106014	All of those titles coming out on the 19th of March.
3106534	3107135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3136889	3138550	Because I knew you were a big fan of Cookie Mama.
3139190	3141771	I would rather just cook it and have someone else do my gardening for me.
3144793	3145213	Let's see.
3145353	3151937	Also coming out, Kuroshitsuji Phantom and Ghost comes out from Squeenix on the 19th of March.
3152397	3155898	And the Pets series also making its way to Japan.
3156239	3158560	Cats, Dogs, Horses, and Monkeys.
3158640	3161301	Those are all separate games making their release in Japan.
3161761	3163182	Zookeeper gets a price reduction.
3163222	3164703	That game's been out forever.
3166138	3167719	Dragon Ball Evolution Dragon Ball Evolution
3195740	3196700	DarkSakura
3218573	3233859	Well, you know, Amazon's been having a new deal now with their game downloads where you can basically buy a game to download for $9.99 or less according to their ad.
3234439	3239601	And a bunch of game developers are not happy about it because they think that their games...
3240662	3241763	should be sold for more.
3242303	3249571	So PopCap and iWin actually pulled a lot of their games off of Amazon saying that it was completely unacceptable.
3250131	3257359	For example, they'd want to put like Jewel Quest for $19.99 and think that $9.99 is way, way too low.
3257379	3258680	That $20 is an acceptable price, $10 is not.
3266154	3270239	So, you can't get those anymore, and from what I understand, the rest of the selection is kind of ass.
3272021	3272642	Interesting.
3278609	3279550	There's a pretty cool...
3281841	3283422	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3299292	3300393	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3319464	3320365	Burnout Paradise
3331573	3333054	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3353371	3354993	I'm keeping that shit, okay?
3355293	3356174	I can understand that.
3356354	3361258	So, you know, I'm not recycling crap because they're just going to put that back in a package and sell it to me again.
3361758	3362359	No, screw it.
3364281	3369245	Not to say that you can't take the glasses out of Disneyland either because they have the Honey, I Shrunk the Audience or whatever.
3369265	3370586	You can get the 3D glasses for that.
3370846	3373248	No, they actually have a cast member waiting there for you to dump them off.
3373589	3374149	That's fine.
3374169	3376031	But the Muppet Show one's freaking awesome.
3376934	3377735	I'm keeping the glasses.
3377755	3378637	That I can understand.
3378697	3378998	Alright, well...
3388789	3392811	I guess kind of changing topics here a little bit, talking about this story out of the UK.
3393011	3396854	There's this campaign called the Change for Life campaign over in the UK.
3398054	3414123	What's interesting about this is it's trying to, I guess you could say it's a campaign, an ad campaign, trying to get folks to not play video games, basically insinuating that video games cause obesity, diabetes, cancer, and so on and so on, just all these bad things.
3415524	3417305	and basically trying to get people to go out and about.
3417785	3420286	For instance, let me read the text on one of their ads here.
3420446	3421667	Risk an early death.
3422107	3422947	Do nothing.
3423568	3427249	Nine out of ten kids risk growing up to have unhealthy amounts of fat in their bodies.
3427390	3433252	Even if you think they look healthy today, adult could bring an early death from heart disease, type 2 diabetes, or cancer.
3433592	3436134	So make sure your kids are active for an hour a day.
3436494	3437854	Reduce how much fat they eat.
3437974	3440195	For more advice, visit this website.
3441636	3449121	And what's interesting about this particular ad that I'm reading from in particular is it features a little kid sitting on the couch holding a PlayStation controller in their hand.
3449181	3451182	Like, oh, I'm just sitting here lazy looking, you know.
3451202	3452263	A healthy looking kid, by the way.
3452283	3452523	Half dead.
3452823	3460668	Yeah, but he definitely looks bored playing PlayStation games, which, you know, there are quite a lot of boring PlayStation 3 games that are out right now.
3460968	3462008	However, that's not the problem.
3462048	3464370	What's going on here, Sony's pissed about this.
3465210	3470532	And Sony is to the point where they are actually thinking about possibly filing a lawsuit.
3471132	3478935	Apparently the agency who made the ad, The Gate, they did not get permission from Sony to use the controller in the ad.
3480355	3489058	And so it is possible that they're talking about possibly Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is considering legal action against the folks that made the ad.
3489699	3490499	And here's the thing.
3492394	3494535	Yes, kids need to get up off the couch.
3494655	3497637	Kids should not sit and play video games all day.
3499178	3504461	What's there to say that video games aren't actually a healthy thing to incorporate into a lifestyle?
3505581	3507942	Maybe an hour a day or a couple hours a week.
3508243	3512265	If you limit it in your kid's life, I don't think it's necessarily such a bad thing at all.
3513203	3514504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3538143	3550934	They're also, though, not factoring in the fact that there are many people who may be clinically overweight who are actually in better health than, like, say that you've got the person who's in their BMI range, correct?
3551134	3551294	Right.
3552052	3576291	and they don't eat properly, they don't exercise, they can't lift much but you've got the person that maybe is say a little over their BMI which by the way BMI is bullshit, you know are overweight but yet they go out and you know bike, go swimming, do things, are active people and have much better cardiovascular system than the you know stupid little anorexic cheerleader type and
3576691	3585356	I mean, you could also have someone incredibly muscle-bound who's the same BMI as someone 300 pounds overweight.
3585796	3593580	I mean, really, you've got to look at the factors of biology, genetics, and more than that.
3595541	3598643	Just sitting in front of the couch playing video games all day is not going to make you die.
3599404	3600264	Comments from chat.
3600304	3602185	I have to read chat.orangelongeradio.com.
3602505	3605226	Xlink says, it's good hand-eye, but so is masturbation.
3605546	3605866	Good point.
3606366	3609306	SSJ100Matt says, go outside and play Dragon's Lair in the backyard.
3610547	3612547	Xbandit says, you can be fat and happy.
3613828	3614128	It's true.
3614168	3617869	You can be fat and happy, but you just got to make sure you're not fat and unhealthy.
3618449	3619849	There's a difference.
3619869	3621049	You can be a triathlete.
3623110	3623610	Let's see.
3623710	3627391	You can be a professional bicyclist and get cancer.
3628595	3629196	True.
3629397	3629697	True.
3629738	3632203	You can be a triathlete who gets hit by a car.
3632784	3633025	Yeah.
3633786	3634789	You know, what does it matter?
3635864	3637245	Then you die an ironic death.
3638146	3645491	Here's the thing is that I think a better ad might be instead of the big text up there that says risk an early death, do just nothing.
3645751	3649374	How about one that says stop using games to babysit your children?
3650235	3652236	That would be an effective ad in my opinion.
3652576	3655659	That would be one because the kid looks bored and everything.
3655999	3658901	So how about stop using games to babysit your children?
3659538	3669101	A responsible parent is going to look beyond... And this is something that I've had to think of a lot myself lately.
3669822	3675104	If you're going to be a responsible parent, you need to be 100% for your kid.
3675544	3678605	Including taking them outside to get them some activity.
3679205	3682266	Including telling them, you know, I think you've played enough.
3682786	3683967	You need to go do this now.
3684887	3691132	You've got to set, you know, you have to do the things that are good for them, not just the things that are convenient for you.
3691712	3695455	That's an awfully nice way to phrase it as a parent, is that, you know, I think you've played enough.
3695695	3698898	Because I know my mom would have said, turn it off and go outside!
3700579	3702561	Well, you know what I mean.
3703281	3704162	No, I know what you mean.
3704822	3708365	My mom would be just like, you're not on that thing again, are you?
3708945	3711287	And then I'd go out and play, come back and she'd be playing my Nintendo.
3713209	3713429	Nice.
3715592	3718909	that's how she got her turn go outside, it's my turn
3719560	3720441	That's pretty much it.
3720621	3721761	Alright, so we'll see what happens.
3721801	3724123	We'll see if Sony does end up suing over this or not.
3724223	3726344	I'm not sure what's gonna end up happening.
3726644	3727605	You know who else will sue?
3727765	3727985	Who?
3728345	3729206	Actually, they won't.
3729746	3732568	But speaking of Sony, we have some stuff about Noby Noby Boy.
3733028	3733349	Okay.
3734930	3741334	Takahashi Keita said that there's going to be an offline multiplayer mode on the way.
3741954	3745516	And that he wants people to enjoy the game, so they're working on an update.
3746917	3747297	There's
3748938	3750801	It's all going to be, though, offline, though.
3751061	3752102	Specifically offline.
3753484	3753824	Boo.
3755126	3758470	And they're saying that it should be roughly around the 18th of April.
3758730	3759651	Well, I mean, not boo.
3759711	3765478	I mean, multiplayer is better than none at all, but, you know, I wish, you know, it's not like the Sony's not connected to the internet, you know?
3766119	3766759	I know, right?
3767620	3768141	So, whatever.
3770276	3770576	I don't know.
3792870	3794591	So it's interesting.
3795471	3800332	Of course, a lot of people are familiar with GamePro, the magazine that's still around, surprisingly.
3801772	3806533	Well, GamePro is actually going to publish indie games now under their new label, GamePro Labs.
3807273	3813675	And you may see some of these games coming to XNA, PC, Zune, iPhone, etc.,
3815945	3820248	Basically, they're going to sort of act as a middleman between indie devs and platform holders.
3821228	3829973	What's also interesting is GamePro has announced that they're planning to produce a free custom edition of its magazine for distribution exclusively at 7-Eleven.
3830994	3836157	So when you get your Slurpee, you can get a free copy of your modified GamePro magazine.
3839072	3842653	Is this going to be an addition to the current subscription magazine?
3842813	3843073	Yes.
3843093	3846074	How is a company like that growing in this economy?
3846094	3850475	I'd like to add as a further dib at the crap that is 7-Eleven.
3850895	3856036	You can go pick up your free magazine when you're picking up a game that's broken street again.
3856376	3859257	You make it sound like it's an issue.
3859277	3861537	7-Eleven doesn't adhere street dates.
3861897	3864898	Nor do I. I know.
3864938	3865798	What's the problem?
3866519	3867959	I thought you were in full support of this.
3869133	3870755	I'm in full support of Slurpees.
3871375	3873458	God damn, if I became rich, I'm getting a Slurpee machine.
3873478	3874979	I miss Vanilla Coke Slurpees.
3875039	3875880	Those were the bomb.
3876781	3878763	What the hell do I have to do to get those to come back?
3880685	3882667	GamePro doing their own game publishing.
3882687	3884369	Do you think we're going to see anything big come out of this?
3884389	3884429	No.
3884449	3889254	Or do you think it's just going to be of the caliber of the types of things that come free with a magazine?
3891075	3891496	DarkSakura.com
3903254	3906517	That's because they have to give away demos that are already available on live.
3906797	3907397	Woo!
3907537	3908338	Demos!
3908818	3909879	I can't download those.
3909899	3912621	That's why I canceled my... See, here's the thing.
3913002	3917665	I used to subscribe to Xbox Magazine back when they used to have demos way before they ever came out.
3917685	3918746	You know, like Saints Row.
3919006	3920067	Because that was awesome.
3920107	3920968	Saints Row demo?
3921028	3921488	Hell yeah!
3922069	3922970	But now it's like...
3923820	3928681	demos for old shit that have been on live for a long time now.
3929222	3931422	Yeah, no thanks, I don't need to subscribe to your magazine anymore.
3931882	3943446	I already get a free membership to stupid, well, not even technically free, but I get a membership to Game Informer because I have that stupid card at GameStop because, you know, it gives me an extra 10% or whatever.
3944526	3944946	Who cares?
3945006	3947507	It's paid for itself, but hey, I get a magazine out of it.
3947547	3951748	And actually, the magazine's not bad, so I'm not buying Xbox Magazine.
3953035	3954075	Game Salad Game Salad Game Salad
3982700	3983581	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4009437	4012319	Don't like RPG Maker, it's still pretty good actually.
4014361	4016322	But no, it's not going to be any good at all.
4016722	4023206	I mean, RPG Maker is pretty awesome, but I've seen some of these games that are hell like click and play.
4024467	4026488	There's just so many limitations to it.
4027944	4030065	I don't know, I think it's just... Well, here's the thing, though.
4030125	4031185	It's not just for shooters.
4031245	4033846	Like, some of the games they say have been made on this that are pretty good.
4033886	4039187	A game called Darkwood that's like a Zelda-ish type of RPG that was made by three students in a week's time.
4040087	4045749	And then DRFT, a 2D racing game that's kind of like the original Grand Theft Auto.
4045769	4050590	Yeah, it sounds like everything that Click and Play could have done, because that's the type of stuff you could do in it.
4050630	4051110	And it's just...
4051750	4057415	It's very limited and yeah, you can make these wonderful little racing games and stuff, but they're just not great.
4057776	4062680	And I hope to God that you can't publish these on the Apple Store because that's all they want.
4063041	4072489	Let's put out a game making program so any idiot can create all this crap and then we can pad our numbers on the App Store and use that in our next commercial.
4072669	4073030	Why not?
4073130	4076513	Any idiot can make a podcast and get it listed on the iTunes Store.
4076573	4077114	Hey, how you doing?
4077654	4083860	Yeah, but iTunes doesn't go, hey, we've got X million podcasts, look at us, we're so awesome.
4084300	4085021	They don't really care.
4087123	4088764	Apple doesn't care about podcasts.
4090526	4094690	Apple doesn't care about a lot of things except getting you to buy their crappy products.
4096912	4099114	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
4099134	4101276	We're almost to the end of Part A of the Classic Game of the Week.
4101316	4103298	Coming up in just a little bit, we've got a couple more stories for you guys.
4103789	4104590	That we do.
4105290	4108633	In fact, something about Resident Evil 5.
4109354	4124768	There's supposed to be a versus download content and it's supposed to be out for 160 Microsoft points or 250 yen on a PlayStation Network.
4125688	4130612	Um, which we're probably going to be getting it for twice as much or something like that.
4130632	4134474	But they're basically saying in Japan it's going to be out, um, March 26th.
4134494	4134554	So...
4139585	4139725	Hmm.
4140626	4141986	Very cool.
4143107	4148590	So, of course, we were talking a little bit earlier about exclusives and that kind of stuff and mentioned Bioshock 2.
4149370	4154512	Well, of course, this month in Game Informer, which also goes back to another story.
4154552	4156353	Man, we're transitioning from two different stories.
4157874	4162837	Bioshock 2 was the cover story and, of course, they revealed the big sister
4167939	4174486	and is a new Big Daddy-esque creature that you're going to be fighting against in the game.
4174866	4189101	Now, there are no real details, at least, leaked out yet about what exactly you're going to be doing, but the second game, apparently, you will be playing as the first Big Daddy, the original Big Daddy.
4189141	4189901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4215720	4217380	It's going to be an awesome game.
4218401	4222481	Bioshock 1 was really sweet, and I can't see that it's going to be any less than that.
4227802	4229623	This game has an awful lot to live up to.
4229703	4230903	Do you think it's going to meet the hype?
4231363	4231843	I think it will.
4232163	4234224	I think they're going to have to do some interesting stuff with it.
4234324	4236964	I thought that it was going to be more above ground and stuff like that.
4237304	4245366	The fact that you're playing as a big daddy from the beginning is kind of... I'm not too sure if I like that idea, but we'll see.
4247130	4247330	Hmm.
4249231	4252372	Alright, well, hey, let's take a trip back to the past here.
4252392	4260755	I'm not talking about the Classic Game of the Week just yet, but here's the interesting thing is that the Genesis, of course, is a system that's been featured many times in the Classic Game of the Week.
4261235	4264476	Apparently, there is this new kind of like...
4265456	4267097	3rd Party Sega Genesis
4281946	4287092	Going for about $53 and with the system comes about 15 games.
4287512	4290736	Sonic & Knuckles, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd, Golden Axe.
4291216	4293138	So all these old school games.
4293158	4296242	And I guess this is what you start to see as these consoles age.
4296602	4302849	I guess the patents expire or something like that and now third party remake these old ass consoles which is interesting.
4303209	4307793	And the best part about this though, because they did release something before, they've done handhelds and that kind of thing.
4308054	4314700	The best part about this though is that it does have its own cartridge slot that will play Mega Drive and Genesis games.
4314720	4317463	So not only do you have the 15 that are built in, but you can put in new ones.
4317963	4318123	Yeah.
4318564	4318984	Very cool.
4320726	4321126	Very cool.
4321667	4325450	All right, well, now what we're going to do, we're going to take a trip back to the past.
4325550	4328231	And I don't know if DarkSakura has picked a Genesis game this week.
4328271	4329192	She might have picked something else.
4329512	4330073	Not in a while.
4330333	4339199	All right, let's take a trip down memory lane and see what the classic game of the week is that all you kids should check out this week by DarkSakura.
4340951	4358454	Well, the secret, the secret, the game of the week is Secret of Mana, which was known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2, and I picked music for it that is actually some of the overworld music, which is my favorite.
4358574	4361615	Well, I thought we were going to do a little...
4376864	4389832	The game came out, it was actually developed by Square, which is now Squeenix, and came out on the Super Nintendo, and we eventually got it on Virtual Console.
4391093	4393575	It's actually, as I said, it's Seiken Densetsu 2.
4393655	4398778	The first one was called Seiken Densetsu Final Fantasy Gaiden for the Game Boy.
4399538	4401499	and we got into Final Fantasy Adventure.
4402640	4406422	It was kind of an interesting little game there.
4406462	4412606	But going back to Secret of Mana, it didn't use the turn-based system.
4412926	4417729	It used a real-time battle, more like how it was in Zelda.
4418530	4428256	But you also had an AI that you could actually control to be either attacking, defense, or somewhere in the middle.
4429062	4433143	and a second player could come in and play one of your other characters.
4433604	4435644	So it was pretty much a two-player RPG.
4436205	4441906	I personally have not tried to do it with the multi-tap to see if you could do three people.
4441946	4443327	So if anyone has, let me know.
4444727	4446668	It just never occurred to me until I was an adult.
4447528	4454471	So the game itself in the American version is...
4457514	4486008	basically you're kicked out of town and you have to go and you hook up with a princess and a sprite and you run around trying to get a different well first of all you get your experience in battle and you level up and you can level up your spells as you you know as you attract them and by the way the multi-tap does work thought I would mention that and the virtual console version will let you use three people
4486648	4495676	But anyway, you have to rescue different elementals, and they give you different attacks, different skills, different things that you can do.
4497698	4504123	But the magic is your party's mana power, which will increase as the game goes on.
4504924	4510969	So, really, it's just you go through different places.
4511129	4512550	You can also get flammy.
4513911	4514672	You remember flammy?
4516376	4519158	The second thing I put on there, Rob, was Flammy's music.
4519178	4521039	The best way I can describe Flammy is...
4532196	4535317	It is like Falkor from The NeverEnding Story.
4536178	4537518	Really, it's the same concept.
4538039	4543021	You ride on this big white dragon thingy's back, and then you can land in different places.
4543441	4545542	But hey, it's Mode 7-tastic!
4547503	4557051	Um, so you can go over the background and you can move and the map will move with you and you can land and it's pretty cool.
4557832	4560454	So, um, it's just a cool little game.
4560974	4566078	I think it's funny though the way that you call them is by doing the little drum with the balls on the string.
4566098	4566439	Like that.
4566499	4567480	I forgot what they're called.
4569958	4572619	Um, but anyway, it's super cool.
4574240	4580063	Um, then at the end you get the mana sword, and you kick ass, and game over.
4581023	4595530	So, um, the game was designed by, um, uh, Ishii Koichi, um, and, um, was actually, um, released after Final Fantasy III, um,
4599391	4607196	They wanted to actually use the system from Final Fantasy IV, but it wouldn't work in the series, so they did it all for Secret of Mana.
4607636	4616202	It was originally going to be an SNES CD add-on, but when they dropped that, they just did it all to fit on the cartridge.
4616463	4619645	I actually had one of the faster localizations.
4619725	4622567	It only took 30 days to translate the game.
4624515	4628318	And we got it.
4629439	4636064	It was also stated that they were going to bring it out for the Wonderswan Color.
4637004	4643869	And they cancelled it when Square decided to tell Bondi WTF, we don't like you anymore.
4645330	4645431	Um...
4649523	4653848	So, that's really, it's been one of the, I think, most popular games.
4653908	4659494	It's been considered by Nintendo Power, it was number 42 in their top 200 games of all time.
4661917	4663198	And it's one of my favorites.
4663619	4670226	And it's actually because of this that I went nuts trying to find Seiken Densetsu 3 and played the most of it on...
4671347	4676009	on a fully translated mom hack I wish I could find again.
4676449	4678189	But it's really, it's a very worthwhile game.
4678209	4687572	If you haven't played it, play the hell out of it and then play Seiken Densetsu 3 because it just evolves on the awesome.
4687592	4688653	So go for it.
4688733	4689673	It's my game.
4689753	4692654	I don't even know why I hadn't reviewed this earlier.
4693594	4694054	Alright.
4694475	4698516	Well there it is, your classic game of the week, Secret of Mana and what a classic game it is.
4699653	4702154	I wonder if they'll ever be highlighting Secret of Evermore
4724113	4726159	Alright, well we are going to take a break here.
4726219	4730550	We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio coming up though in Orange Lounge Radio Part B. So stay tuned.
4730650	4731272	Don't go anywhere.
4731332	4732555	We will be right back.
4738888	4753300	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March the 15th of 2009, where we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night on allgames.com, All Games Radio, bringing you lots and lots of great gaming shows throughout the week.
4754061	4763128	We're on right after another great gaming show called The Bobby Blackwolf Show, and we run for about three hours until we're tired and we want to go home, is basically how long we do the show.
4763769	4764069	Snake360Light.com
4790587	4792167	on Xbox Live Marketplace.
4792608	4797429	And it's the same game as pretty much was up there before, except now it's half the price.
4797969	4802030	Now, of course, since it is half the price, there's a little less features than what you have in the full game.
4802710	4813453	But now I guess you get some two different multiplayer modes now, three single-player courses, three difficulty levels, multiple control schemes, just like in the other game.
4813773	4817694	You still get some of the soundtrack from the same recording, and so on and so on.
4817794	4817974	So...
4818914	4819275	Pretty cool.
4819375	4819776	Check that out.
4819796	4821158	Support independent game development.
4821740	4822441	Snake360 Lite.
4822461	4825747	Alright, now we're going to get back into some other gaming news.
4825807	4826348	Yes, Loki?
4826589	4827130	Yes, we are.
4828172	4829074	Some pretty cool stuff...
4831425	4832526	I don't know, this is kind of weird.
4833026	4839589	Nintendo has addressed complaints that they had not that many games coming out.
4839689	4841790	They're low output of first party titles.
4842410	4851274	Apparently, it says this year, Nintendo seems to be getting some more games coming out, including the equally awaited Punch-Out!!
4851974	4852895	Of course, they've just...
4854468	4854968	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4882073	4883354	And they're like, well, we don't know what to do.
4884055	4888400	So now that they're putting out more games, they're trying to make sure people are going to be happy.
4888840	4890502	The thing, though, you ask me...
4891510	4891970	Thanks for watching!
4914873	4916094	That does not count.
4916414	4917876	Putting old things in new packaging.
4918316	4919117	That doesn't count at all.
4919437	4922179	ExciteBots and PunchOut.
4922259	4923981	That does count because those are brand new.
4924581	4928284	But these new play control games, I'm sorry, I'm getting a little sick of them.
4928885	4931907	And they've just started coming out, but just tell people to stop buying them.
4932007	4934449	But the thing is, that's all that's coming out now.
4934509	4937612	It's like, people are so hungry for Nintendo games.
4937652	4939494	Like, oh god, I want a new Pikmin game.
4940294	4942656	Well, now you're going to buy the re-release of Pikmin 1 and 2.
4944261	4946561	GameGuru in our chatroom says Punch Out is very much a remake.
4970822	4972844	It is, but it is adding new characters.
4972964	4976928	And it's not so much, you know, it may be a remake, but it's not a port.
4976968	4982914	You have a Super Nintendo game, too, and it's at least kind of redone from the ground up, and there are some new things in it.
4983034	4983935	And it's not a port.
4984015	4989501	It's not like, oh, I took the GameCube game, didn't really change anything to it, and then just poured it over.
4989521	4994826	And now, you know, Pikmin 1 and Mario Power Tennis, they didn't really add anything to it.
4995186	5021184	Donkey Kong Jungle Beat from what I hear they're adding some additional levels I don't know if it was in the Japanese version or if these are brand new levels but they're adding something to it and then Pikmin 2 are supposed to have two different types of Pikmin that weren't originally in the game so they are adding something to it but still it's a port of a game that's been out for a long time now GS68 in chat asks where's my new play control Custer's Revenge
5022216	5023337	That wasn't on the GameCube.
5024017	5027320	It wasn't, but maybe it's a game he's thinking needs to make a comeback.
5027360	5027660	I don't know.
5028380	5029041	All right, well, look.
5029601	5036506	If you want to look for some new Wii games that actually look kind of interesting and you want to talk about a remake, I don't know if this is really a remake, though.
5036726	5039949	This is like a reinvention completely of the old game Pong.
5039969	5046873	I'm going to actually play a little clip here from the little trailer that we have here in studio because this actually looks kind of neat.
5046954	5051537	It's like a... Let me see if I can play a little clip here.
5054073	5055879	It's like a music based game.
5056360	5060854	It's called Bit Trip Beat and it's by a company called Axis.
5063311	5085270	and it's actually coming out to WiiWare on Monday and it's like all these little pong balls consistently are coming at your little paddle and you have to bounce them back and when you do it makes little beat music like the like 8-bit weapon type of chiptunes music that's what I was looking for um I guess this game's coming out it's gonna be 600 points here's the thing the controls you just tilt the control back and forth you tilt the little Wiimote back and forth
5085610	5086452	This should be on the DS.
5101405	5103587	No, I like the idea of only having to pay $6 for this.
5103807	5104848	But this should be on the DS.
5105508	5105869	Who knows?
5105909	5107030	Maybe if this does well, it will be.
5107350	5112694	But this boss stage looks just like a freaking regular breakout or something like that.
5112734	5113335	It's crazy.
5113435	5113755	Trippy.
5114456	5114956	Very trippy.
5116878	5117598	Hence the name.
5118359	5119100	Exactly.
5119240	5120080	So you can check that out.
5120100	5121782	It'll be out on WeWare on Monday, it sounds like.
5122262	5124284	By the time most of you hear this podcast, it'll already be out.
5125125	5128668	ActDeft in chat says, BitTripBeat is basically Pong and Rez's bastard child.
5128968	5129348	Kind of.
5130069	5130369	Kind of.
5132935	5137619	Well, I have bad, bad news.
5138219	5139480	Actually, not really bad news.
5139980	5140341	What's that?
5141381	5152370	It's not likely news, but Capcom US is hoping that we get a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which I think would be freaking fantastic.
5153370	5155372	And, I mean, it's got Gatchaman.
5155972	5156853	What else do you need, right?
5156873	5156993	Right.
5159026	5170696	Um, they're saying, um, it was basically a quote by Christian Svensson, um, who is the developer, the business developer and strategic planning VP at Capcom said, do not rule out, um, do not rule a Western release out.
5170997	5172198	That's all I can say right now.
5172318	5174620	We are still actively working on having that happening.
5175000	5176041	I can't say it's happening.
5176081	5176581	Definitely.
5176902	5180565	I couldn't give you a time, but as badly as the fans want it, we want to bring it.
5181025	5183868	The problem that they're running into is what do we all say?
5183948	5185369	Licensing, right?
5189254	5193218	Tatsunoko rights are actually split among several companies in the U.S.
5193879	5197843	Whereas, of course, in Japan, Tatsunoko Pro has all of them.
5198123	5199104	You don't have to worry about it.
5199564	5207092	But here, it's like, you know, whoever had, you know, Gatchaman 2 has Eagle Riders here.
5207532	5209134	You know, there was Battle of the Planets.
5209274	5210795	There was G-Force.
5211636	5212577	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5233556	5237998	in later anime, home releases, different things like that.
5238998	5243239	Or even people who just thought about bringing it out over here and paid the licensing rights.
5243259	5244020	That does happen.
5245660	5257064	It's going to be a pain to get everything together, so they're actually going to have to do a lot of work for us to get the game over here, and it's all down to freaking licensing.
5259326	5260147	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5280267	5282449	These are originally our characters, so forget it.
5282810	5285913	But I guess, sadly, in a sue-happy world, that's not what can be done.
5286834	5292280	Well, the way that it is is that once Tatsunoko's given up the rights, they have to abide by contract.
5292501	5293802	Yeah, no, I get it.
5293902	5294463	It just sucks.
5294503	5299629	Yeah, and Tatsunoko Pro, I don't think, really has any holdings in the U.S., so it'd be nice.
5300529	5301990	So then they couldn't be sued in a U.S.
5302030	5302250	court.
5303711	5309134	But Tatsunoko wouldn't legally be able to give the approval, which they clearly did in Japan.
5309234	5311895	They just would not legally be able to do approval in the United States.
5312236	5312896	No, I know.
5312956	5313356	I get it.
5313416	5313956	It just sucks.
5314557	5314877	That's all.
5314897	5315437	It just sucks.
5317910	5318851	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5338106	5344730	You don't get, uh, what's his name from, oh, you know, Frank West from, uh, you know, Dead Rising in there and stuff as a character?
5345230	5345830	No, no, no.
5345890	5347031	Eh, sadly, I'm not gonna hold my breath.
5347051	5348332	They need Gatchaman Fighter.
5348812	5349012	Eh.
5349032	5350213	Just Gatchaman.
5350233	5350873	Whatever.
5350913	5359018	And they need to make it for me, specifically, and say, because Jamie demanded it, we give you... And it would actually say that in the opening credits.
5359178	5359718	Exactly.
5359999	5362320	We give you Gatchaman the Battle.
5364307	5367468	and then I would be very gratified as a fangirl.
5388812	5390413	Resident Evil Remake Resident Evil Classics
5418643	5428792	I'm not sure if that's going to be a new play control game or something like that, but that's going to be coming out for a $30 price point.
5432055	5433156	The studio is haunted.
5439282	5441484	We're having the attack of the random beeping noise.
5449977	5450679	Here, just give that to me.
5450739	5451360	I'll turn that off.
5451942	5453105	Live radio, everybody.
5453466	5454508	It's my sensor bar.
5454709	5455631	Batteries are going out.
5456624	5457285	Sorry about that, guys.
5480846	5482728	I thought you were going to say Showgirls.
5496832	5498233	DarkSakura.com
5521761	5522481	Anyhow, forget it
5543334	5544075	Super Tree Run Super Sandwich
5571313	5574635	The game looks crazy and Nellie keeps asking me when it's coming out.
5575915	5578077	And we don't know, right?
5578477	5580078	The 22nd or 20th of April?
5580538	5581099	Yeah.
5582079	5584160	Not too far out.
5584901	5586482	Hey, it's time for a birthday present.
5587082	5587743	For me!
5587763	5590584	It's always got to be about you now, doesn't it?
5590724	5592746	Yes, it always must be about me.
5593606	5596068	I have to have the show's ego after all.
5597444	5604386	Anyway, how about something related to Namco, maybe?
5605286	5605506	Okay.
5606747	5612988	Well, Namco has actually registered Excalibur as a trademark.
5614569	5624291	They're not really saying much about it, but it actually has an ESRB listing some achievements revealed.
5624471	5625932	Like I said, the registered trademark.
5627192	5652826	um and so it's there Namco Bandai is releasing Excalibur so of course the theory is that you know it's about King Arthur but maybe it's another in the Soul Calibur family or maybe a fighting game using the same engine or a remake of that old game Excalibur 2555 AD um
5655908	5659570	I have a feeling that whatever it is, it's going to be lame and disappointing.
5661971	5663892	It's going to be about Pac-Man.
5664272	5665292	Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
5665552	5666493	No, that's Namco for you.
5666533	5668434	It's either going to be really awesome or really lame.
5668594	5670214	And it's usually nothing in between.
5672255	5673556	I'm voting really lame.
5675229	5675770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5691625	5702239	X-Caliber is the storyline based on fighters that have dropped out of the Soul Calibur series and now have to find real daytime jobs, including working fast food restaurants.
5702279	5702619	I get it.
5702860	5704782	X-Caliber.
5704882	5705423	You're funny.
5707608	5708689	What a fun guy.
5708829	5710290	Ha ha ha.
5710710	5717194	Or it's a fighting game featuring all the exes in the relationship.
5717254	5719596	I think now's a good time to just go to the next story, Loki.
5720216	5720796	I'll stop now.
5722785	5726028	We do know what this game is though, Wii Rock Drum King.
5726108	5728730	It's a brand new drumming game for the Wii.
5729010	5735015	Of course, not using any actual peripherals other than the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, or possibly two remotes if you have those.
5735976	5747186	What it does have though is a pretty cool song list, and the track list was revealed this week, including some stuff that you would not normally see in a music game like this.
5748993	5749313	Feel Good Inc.
5749353	5749554	Gorillaz
5766689	5774272	One of the weird ones that was in there, they had Organ Donor, the instrumental version by DJ Shadow.
5774792	5778313	You normally wouldn't see that in a rock game like this.
5778993	5792818	Some other songs that are in there as well, they have All Star by Smash Mouth, No One Knows by the Queens of the Stone Age, The Takeover, The Breaksover by Fall Out Boy, and
5795054	5802738	Can't Stand Losing You by The Police, Spoon Man by Soundgarden, and Click Click Boom by Saliva.
5809369	5809769	All right.
5809809	5811931	You know, I was still tempted to get Rock Revolution this week.
5811971	5812491	It's only $20.
5812772	5814133	There's tons of them sitting on the shelf.
5814173	5817795	I'm almost thinking it's going to drop to $9.99 before too long.
5817855	5818776	That's when I'll have to get it.
5818796	5825001	It won't drop officially to $9.99, but just let it sit there and fester a while, and it's eventually going to drop down.
5825821	5829564	So bad, they actually canceled the Wii version of Rock Revolution.
5830104	5830325	Ouch.
5831025	5835969	Because that was actually supposedly slated for April, still coming out at $50 retail.
5836229	5837570	I'm like, yeah, no one's going to buy that.
5837730	5838070	Wow.
5839111	5840493	So, yeah, they just canceled it.
5840573	5840813	Wow.
5841214	5843377	I wonder if there's sales figures on how much that game actually sold.
5845020	5845781	Oh, I'm sure there are.
5846081	5848462	In fact, I have an idea where to look.
5849103	5853605	Alright, well, while you do that, let me talk about some other games that aren't necessarily just there to be sold.
5854346	5855406	It's actually kind of neat.
5855506	5856487	This is over in Japan.
5856527	5862851	There's a Nintendo Game Seminar program, and if you're a student of this, you get to make your own DS game, basically, as a part of the program.
5863171	5869235	Well, Nintendo has actually taken these games that were created, and now they're available at DS download stations throughout Japan.
5869675	5872837	And you can also get them through the Wii Nintendo channel.
5873217	5874517	There's four games available.
5874618	5879819	One of them is a mic-controlled game in which you blow to kind of create air that sends stars up in the sky.
5880660	5889863	Another one is where you are a voice artist that reads lines, and then when they're played back, they're given by like a weird character on screen, a random one or something.
5890783	5898826	Another one is an action game where you move around and you pose, but I'm not sure exactly how that's done because they didn't say these were for the DSi, although...
5899406	5900507	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5923624	5926247	and not just that, but now they have kind of a way to get it out there.
5926267	5928689	It's almost kind of like a little bit XNA-ish.
5929370	5939179	So I don't know if that's something, maybe this is a sign that Nintendo might use the DSi download service for this or some of their other distribution channels, but that is kind of an interesting thought, right?
5940280	5941862	Yeah.
5942082	5944064	Although it could just be a bunch of crapware, I don't know.
5945316	5946337	Thanks for watching!
5966899	5971163	0.5 million copies were sold for the Xbox 360 version.
5971664	5973586	That is the highest of the three.
5973606	5974447	That's not bad.
5974507	5976109	That's a half million, right?
5976129	5976709	0.5 million or 0.05?
5976749	5977009	0.05 million.
5977029	5977450	Oh, so 50,000 copies.
5983096	6003690	and that is the best one out of all three versions the PS3 version sold .02 million copies or 20,000 and then finally the DS version only sold 10,000 copies well that's sad because the DS version seemed like the only one that made sense out of the bunch
6004844	6006605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6031750	6035875	It made me giggle inside in a painful way.
6035895	6037677	Did we get any emails of substance?
6038458	6039099	Yes.
6039439	6039760	All right.
6042623	6045747	First of all, this is, it says, So this is a multiple email.
6050290	6056274	First, where are my shows and two, boy, do I have a slew of reviews for you.
6056995	6073827	Okay, alright, first, Tony Hawk's Project 8, another Tony Hawk title for the PSP, but this time around, it is a bit more challenging, no auto-kick, the story is cheesy as always, but anyways, it's awesome, and if you are a skater, wanna be by this.
6076029	6077470	I'm sorry, I really can't read this.
6078729	6079410	Yeah, I'm looking at this.
6079610	6081091	It looks like it was written on a PSP.
6083313	6084074	I'm going to try.
6084895	6085195	Alright.
6086336	6089519	Okay, I'm going to translate into English, okay?
6089839	6090400	Will that be fine?
6092068	6093009	Okay, Wipeout Pure.
6093189	6100296	A lot of us kids who own a DS and owned a GBA know of F-Zero and GX.
6101017	6104320	They have not released anything for a long time, and I own a PSP.
6104981	6106623	I thought that it would be a good idea.
6107283	6110687	Instead, it was, and I'll tell you, it was more of a challenge than F-Zero.
6111167	6113630	GTA Liberty City... Okay.
6114230	6117072	I know what you're thinking, what a 15 year old is doing with a GTA game.
6117192	6121374	I bought it on Amazon using my debit card and got it a few weeks.
6121434	6123015	I popped it in and I instantly love it.
6123035	6127338	The custom soundtrack stuff takes some work, but once you do it, it's awesome.
6127718	6133181	Killing police from my safe house with a sniper rifle and racking up a 6 star rating is so fun.
6133621	6136383	Definitely recommend it to a first time PSP buyer.
6137043	6139665	Lords of Dogtown, I Love Skateboarding and Surfing Stuff.
6140325	6147130	This movie combined a little bit of both with a story about Jay Adams, Tony Alva, and Stacey Peralta.
6147570	6148551	Okay.
6148671	6149231	Alright, last thing.
6150032	6150672	I have one question.
6150752	6157977	Have you guys ever heard of Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System or the Neo Geo CD, King of Fighters is Better Than Street Fighter, Peace Out, DS Lover?
6158337	6165982	Okay, first of all, I own a Neo Geo and I have a Neo Geo CD as well and I have
6167725	6175224	A Neo Geo Pocket Color and a Neo Geo Pocket So I'm really not sure which one you're asking about But King of Fighters
6179312	6180953	It really depends on what you're into.
6181093	6182494	I love the King of Fighters series.
6182534	6185717	I mean, talk about your cheap bitches and hard to pull off attacks.
6185957	6190940	I mean, Street Fighter is a little bit more gratifying to play, but King of Fighters is just a little bit more.
6191921	6194903	Sometimes there's a bit more of a fun factor involved with the King of Fighters games.
6195043	6201548	And I do have to say that if you've got it on the Neo Geo, you've got it arcade perfect and you have also paid for it.
6202188	6204330	So that's all I can say about that.
6205331	6205491	Rob?
6206952	6214673	Um, you know, yeah, King of Fighters is sort of like an evolution of Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting and those games, and it's okay.
6214993	6223435	Like, it's not something I really can usually tolerate long-term, though, the SNK games, but they do have that whole, like, you know, foreground and background thing, which is kind of what made them famous.
6224075	6225955	That was just Fatal Fury.
6226275	6227556	I don't, oh, was it just Fatal Fury?
6227596	6229196	I thought King of Fighters had it, too.
6229576	6229876	My bad.
6230956	6231956	Did Art of Fighting have it?
6231996	6232816	No, I think just Fatal Fury.
6232856	6234777	No, Art of Fighting had the weird zoom in and out thing.
6234817	6235457	That was its little niche.
6235477	6236057	That was Summer Showdown.
6237006	6237706	R-Fighting did it too.
6237786	6238606	The first one did at least.
6238966	6241587	Yeah, no, it was Fatal Fury that had the background foreground.
6241787	6243447	Yeah, yeah.
6244067	6247888	It's different and worth a play, but I don't think it's necessarily better.
6248508	6249069	If that makes sense.
6249549	6251109	But I love Capcom vs. SNK.
6251129	6252569	That's one of my favorite fighters right there.
6254090	6255030	So, Matt, what's your preference?
6255050	6255970	Street Fighter or King of Fighting?
6256870	6257410	King of Fighters.
6258650	6259671	Do you have a preference, Loki?
6260111	6261591	Robin Street Fighter vs. King of Fighters?
6261891	6262071	No?
6262211	6262731	You hate them all?
6263671	6265912	Not hate, but I just don't really care.
6266400	6267361	I will tell you this.
6268021	6271744	Any of the King of Fighters games on Saturn have a bitch of a load time.
6272605	6273645	Seriously.
6274486	6275547	In between rounds.
6276047	6278769	Load time.
6279710	6282412	So, next email.
6283172	6293240	Hi, I was just wondering if it was possible for you guys to create a widget for Samsung phones for your podcast as I would love to be able to listen to you on the go and download your shows wherever I am.
6293720	6294521	Thanks, Simmel.
6296808	6299931	I've not even heard of the Samsung phones widget thing.
6299971	6301252	That's not something I'm familiar with.
6301272	6303194	Send us more information on how to make one.
6303234	6306277	If it's just doing a simple website or something, I'm sure we can figure it out.
6306677	6310661	If it involves programming like an iPhone application, well, I don't know so much about that.
6312142	6327787	if it's something you can connect to iTunes I don't know if your phone I don't know because there's a lot of Samsung phones if your phone my old phone was a Samsung and if it has a memory card like my old one you can put your own songs or your own music on it basically you should be able to just sync it up with iTunes and download our podcast on iTunes and do it that way
6328700	6330321	That's the best thing I can think of.
6330341	6332282	With all its fails, we can look and see what that is.
6332522	6335924	Yeah, if it's easy enough, why not?
6336024	6341947	We also got one... That last one and this one that I'm about to read is actually put in through the website.
6342707	6342907	Cool.
6342927	6343488	That's pretty cool.
6344368	6347430	First of all, the catchphrase thing you got here is fucking terrible.
6348350	6349531	Okay.
6349591	6352572	I got it wrong because it's really confusing and erased my whole goddamn message.
6353393	6356775	I don't really think that's the fault of the program.
6358315	6361056	Anyway, I was just wondering why the show takes so long to go up now.
6361156	6362736	It used to go up the day after recording.
6362756	6363917	Do not take this as a complaint.
6364017	6364797	I am just curious.
6364877	6365177	Thanks.
6366697	6377540	Just because my setup here changed, and I have two computers now that I have to go back and forth between, and then also this week I was on a work trip, so I try to do it as I can.
6378220	6382282	Other people are offering to help make the process go faster, so we'll hopefully get on that.
6382962	6383162	Sorry.
6384827	6385688	Last email.
6385848	6390010	And actually, you know what, I'm going to save this one for a last minute story, Rob.
6390671	6390951	Okay.
6391091	6399417	But I am going to go ahead and credit the story to, well, they didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say, Nigel, thank you.
6400337	6400617	Alright.
6401158	6403319	And it will be one of our last minute stories.
6404020	6404520	Congrats.
6404540	6406301	You have contributed to the show.
6407122	6407662	Alright, level up.
6407682	6408362	The winner is you.
6408422	6409083	Here's a no prize.
6410115	6415057	If you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send them to.
6415517	6416597	Let's get back into some gaming news.
6416637	6416877	Loki.
6417378	6417598	Yes.
6419118	6427221	So there's some really neat download content that's going to be coming out very soon for Fear 2 Project Origin.
6428101	6430542	It's called the Toy Soldiers download content.
6431122	6434383	And what it is is it's a few multiplayer maps that they're adding in.
6434443	6435964	But what's kind of neat about it is...
6436504	6442386	It's all done from the perspective that you're small little toy soldiers fighting in these giant areas.
6442867	6450290	So for example, some of the maps that they have, they have a hospital room that you'll actually fight around in.
6450630	6452290	They have a playground.
6452891	6457793	And then finally, one that Jamie I think will like, they have one that you fight inside of a pinball machine.
6458153	6458613	Sweet!
6460147	6461809	So yeah, very cool.
6461929	6464911	Kind of a unique twist to the whole multiplayer stuff.
6465552	6467714	And I'm glad that they're actually having a little bit of fun with it.
6467894	6469575	But it looks pretty sweet.
6469595	6471977	I have to say that the pinball machine looks the best out of all of them.
6473859	6476621	Now only if the giant metal ball is rolling around in there too.
6476641	6477122	That'd be cool.
6480865	6484488	But no word on when exactly these will be available.
6484948	6487591	Oh, I guess it'll be in April and it will be free.
6488849	6489870	So that's awesome.
6490951	6492412	Free stuff is always welcome.
6493633	6495455	That's the best kind of download content is free.
6497782	6500603	Well, a new trademark has been filed this week.
6501144	6503205	Sing Hero is the trademark.
6503265	6510148	Of course, you know that was filed by Activision, Blizzard, the folks behind Guitar Hero and DJ Hero.
6510568	6513129	Apparently now Sing Hero has been patented.
6514430	6514990	What do you think?
6515110	6519432	Is this going to be their version of Sing Star or Karaoke Revolution?
6519452	6521513	We need to milk the Hero franchise.
6524704	6530708	Although, I will say though, keep in mind this company also trademarked Drum Villain and I don't think that ever happened.
6531629	6535152	So just because they trademarked it doesn't mean the game is actually going to happen.
6535993	6544079	Yeah, but they also could mean just because they trademarked Drum Villain, maybe they just rolled that into Guitar Hero World Tour.
6544279	6547922	But singing's in Guitar Hero World Tour, so I'm not sure why they're going to have this whole separate game.
6547942	6549143	Well, maybe this is going to have more pop music.
6550023	6550504	That could be.
6551444	6551845	Oh boy.
6553021	6573111	Well, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear stories like this, I can just hear the sounds of the Guitar Hero franchise being milked even more, and that's like after seeing the arcade game this week and everything, and it's just like, I'm starting to get pretty sick of all this stuff, and it just makes me angsty, because, you know, it used to be such a good game, but now it's just getting, like, beaten to dead horse.
6573711	6575792	So I get angsty, and that's why the FUs of the Week happen.
6591856	6603642	I have a couple of FUs, but one of them is a very big, very major one, and it's directed towards my body for reasons that I choose not to disclose publicly at this time.
6604602	6606783	But certain people know what I'm talking about.
6607664	6612026	And the second one, it goes towards a lack of tact.
6614307	6614587	I'm done.
6616688	6616948	Loki!
6617711	6620193	Happy to Burger King for burning my fries.
6620914	6627500	I have never... Honestly, I'd expect this kind of thing from McDonald's because they fuck up their fries more times than not.
6628140	6629682	But Burger King, come on, man.
6629722	6635046	Your fries are usually pretty tasteless and they're fixed by ketchup, but these fries were burnt.
6635487	6636808	I mean, they were browned.
6637153	6643795	Oh, and the other thing too, if you ask me if I want ketchup with my fries, don't just not give me ketchup.
6644155	6647536	Don't ask me the question and just say, oh, here's no ketchup for you.
6648516	6649697	You'd like some ketchup, wouldn't you?
6649717	6650637	But I'm not giving you any.
6650797	6651577	I'm not giving you any.
6652198	6657119	So F you to minimum wage Burger King workers.
6658494	6676221	um well geez as GS68 in chat says poor poor Loki's fries um I don't really have anything that major this week I guess two FUs one FU goes to jet lag because that sucks and my sleep has been all screwed up like for the past four days because of it um I was in Washington DC this week by the way just for a few days
6677181	6679603	If you were following me on Twitter, you probably saw some of that stuff.
6680503	6686666	Otherwise, my only other F you would go to the fact that we have no Dunkin' Donuts here in California, at least NorCal.
6687187	6690589	And that's sad because I freaking love their coffee.
6690949	6698313	But I actually brought back a Dunkin' Donut for my roommate on the plane from Texas because I always gush about...
6698894	6702338	Dunkin' Donuts, even though the donuts are only okay.
6702358	6704060	To me, I'm not as huge on the donuts.
6704080	6704701	It's the coffee.
6704861	6705722	I love the coffee.
6705803	6706483	They're not bad.
6706503	6707285	They're not bad at all.
6713214	6714634	So, that's really it.
6714995	6718196	Those are my not-so-serious FUs of the week, but that's what I've got.
6718396	6720656	I guess the jetlag one's actually pretty serious.
6720696	6722257	That really was annoying.
6722637	6724538	I did want to say, though, about a Sing Hero.
6724598	6729479	I wanted to read some comments here in chat about that because I thought one of these in particular was pretty good.
6730500	6735661	GameGuru, I believe, said that they might just be trying to protect their trademark.
6735681	6737142	I think it's just protecting trademarks.
6737802	6738482	GameGuru GameGuru
6759912	6760893	Hitstun says, F.U.
6760933	6763194	Sky, you have arcades with Street Fighter 4 and we don't.
6763674	6763954	I do?
6764795	6766196	Oh, I guess here in California, yeah.
6766256	6767697	I just haven't driven to them.
6767957	6768617	Not around us.
6768817	6769838	Yeah, not here in SAC.
6771038	6772880	But we do have the Guitar Hero Arcade now.
6773320	6776702	They have Mario Kart 2, which I didn't check out, but they have that.
6777402	6778083	I thought that would be fun.
6778243	6778303	Eh.
6778323	6780144	You need to get drunk and go play it.
6780704	6782805	Yeah, but I don't know.
6782825	6784386	I didn't really care for Mario Kart Arcade.
6785327	6785887	It was kind of lame.
6786748	6788388	It was, but maybe the sequel has fixed some things.
6788709	6789069	You never know.
6789654	6790474	No, doubt it.
6791115	6792315	Alright, let's get into another story.
6794016	6795337	They need more F-Zero GX.
6797118	6798258	They do need more F-Zero GX.
6798738	6801840	Well, there is another interesting thing.
6801880	6803761	You know how all these LEGO games have been coming out?
6803961	6805061	There's more!
6806322	6808103	More, more, more!
6808723	6811525	Which means people must be buying all the ones that are out there now.
6812385	6813165	You know what, though?
6813285	6816007	They're doing it for a good reason, because they are pretty damn fun.
6817068	6819894	But one's sort of a late franchise now.
6819954	6821358	They're doing a Harry Potter Lego.
6822752	6823552	It's never too late.
6852310	6853171	I'm not surprised at all.
6874520	6882225	But basing your game, I would have to guess it would probably be the original game plus the new stuff as well.
6882425	6883046	So, I don't know.
6884107	6885187	They're kind of fun.
6885247	6886748	I mean, I understand why they're coming out.
6886788	6889750	It's not like one of these games that I look at and go, WTF, why are we getting this?
6889790	6891231	But I get this.
6891892	6893093	So, it's not really a surprise at all.
6893113	6897636	And you've been speculating, Loki, for quite some time that the Harry Potter game is going to be the next Lego thing.
6897796	6898376	Of course.
6898456	6899477	This is no surprise.
6899597	6902658	If they've got a toy for it, they're going to make a game for it.
6902758	6910059	Now, if you see all of a sudden LEGO Halo toys coming out, then you better believe that there's going to be a LEGO Halo game at some point.
6910119	6911580	But otherwise, it's an April Fool's joke.
6911720	6913620	Yes, otherwise it's an April Fool's joke.
6913680	6914060	Fair enough.
6914660	6926023	I wouldn't be surprised if we see another LEGO Batman game, because that's something that they can keep adding to and basically have unlimited content for, because they're not based off movies.
6926283	6926463	Yeah.
6927759	6929440	That's a problem, basing stuff off movies.
6930240	6931940	When they don't make any more movies, you have no more games.
6932761	6934261	Another comment from GameGuru in chat.
6934561	6937582	Unfortunately, Lego Prince of Persia will likely be next when the toys come out.
6938523	6939043	Will it, though?
6940603	6942884	They rebooted the Prince of Persia franchise recently.
6942944	6944985	Won't they make the sequel in that kind of...
6946471	6947412	Thanks for watching!
6962401	6962861	Maybe.
6963141	6969424	I mean, if they do, if the movie comes out and it's really popular and stuff and everyone's interested in it, I don't know if they're really going to do it.
6970284	6972765	It would all depend on how many toys come out and how well the toys do.
6973965	6975966	Rice Princess in chat says, I love Lego games.
6976006	6977147	I love Harry Potter games.
6977207	6979227	The two combined would make my head explode.
6982709	6983069	Let's see.
6983129	6986810	Giovedea says, Lego doesn't sell the HP sets anymore.
6986890	6989331	You can't even get the sets off Lego.com.
6989671	6990252	That's true.
6990452	6990752	Hmm.
6992150	6992591	Interesting.
6993031	6995193	Dr. Tatsuya says, still waiting on Lego Watchmen.
6996495	6997756	Yeah, I don't think so.
6997776	6998617	I don't know about that one.
6999678	7001680	Will it come complete with a detachable penis?
7002861	7003622	For Dr. Manhattan.
7003642	7005424	Special soundtrack by King Missile.
7005664	7011030	No, he'll have his little, like, you know, molecular underpants.
7011290	7013893	Which I did not understand because, you know...
7015986	7018347	He could wear underpants, yet he didn't.
7018407	7019568	And he doesn't really exist.
7019748	7020829	I never saw the movie.
7020849	7028813	The whole point was that he's detached from humanity and humanity's standards, so it doesn't matter to him if he's dressed or not.
7028833	7030914	Because, I mean, seriously, if you think about it...
7031534	7033315	What are the Viet Cong going to be really scared of?
7033435	7036176	A giant glowing blue penis is coming towards them.
7036216	7039738	I am so down with Dr. Manhattan.
7040378	7041559	He's wearing his black pants.
7041819	7043119	Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
7043139	7044980	He should have just been buck wild there.
7045000	7047121	I'm just going to do the show naked from now on.
7047281	7048262	I agree with what Dr. Manhattan said.
7048282	7049362	Really, it doesn't matter.
7049582	7051823	No amount of blue penis makes that movie any good.
7052143	7053284	Oh well.
7054733	7055493	Sad Trombone
7079525	7080666	I should do just as well.
7080966	7082528	Since it's going to be Infinity Ward again.
7082968	7084550	Because everyone knows that Treyarch sucks.
7087493	7089114	I know a lot of people who play Call of Duty 4.
7089154	7090636	This number doesn't surprise me one bit.
7091236	7091316	No.
7094949	7095930	Danny Harrison, son of George Harrison
7111348	7111868	Thank you for watching!
7133360	7139405	So as if this game wasn't going to sell to the Beatle collectors already, imagine if this game has never before heard Beatle stuff.
7139745	7143528	I couldn't believe that anything like that still exists, to be honest.
7143608	7145089	But there you go.
7145830	7152896	Apparently, by the way, Donnie, who's the son of, of course, George Harrison, he's been a big part of actually trying to get the Beatles rock band to happen.
7153216	7155918	He's in a band of his own who has an album coming out this month.
7156439	7156780	AppleCore
7165683	7167905	And convinced everyone to sort of have a presentation.
7168445	7171727	The game has been in the making for two years.
7172228	7179073	They say it's historically accurate, a real headache, but it's the most enjoyable work that he's been a part of, apparently.
7179793	7181074	So it sounds like it could be interesting.
7181915	7182935	Could be.
7183196	7184717	9909 is when this game's coming out.
7184757	7186298	It's pretty hard to forget that release date.
7188019	7190101	Well, hey, all we have to do is remember Dreamcast.
7190841	7191201	Or that.
7191802	7191942	Yep.
7192984	7198146	I forgot to mention in the gaming week, we actually did bust out the Dreamcast and go through some Sonic Adventure.
7198346	7198666	Nice.
7199387	7201887	All of our VMUs still work.
7202328	7202968	Oh my gosh.
7203068	7204609	We have all of our Samba files too.
7206549	7207710	Here's some other news.
7208750	7210891	Wallace and Gromit is still out there.
7213012	7217254	There is actually a game coming out on March 24th with a demo on the 16th.
7219074	7220455	Telltale Games is putting this out.
7222236	7227938	But it's part of, as far as I'm aware, the episodic Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures.
7228838	7231439	So, hey, keep your eyes open for it.
7232380	7237522	And there's also going to be another Strong Bad game.
7240016	7246543	If you pre-order Wallace and Gromit, you'll get a full episode of actually Sam and Max and Strong Bad.
7247384	7247925	So there you go.
7249787	7250428	That's pretty cool.
7250728	7250968	Nice.
7251709	7252490	Nice little bonus there.
7253451	7255553	I like full games as bonuses.
7255574	7256194	That's a good deal.
7257195	7257536	Definitely.
7259085	7269812	Now this is kind of not new to the MMO scene, but Final Fantasy XI has finally jumped on board, much like the Blizzard Authenticator.
7270152	7278098	They now have something very similar to that that will generate random passcodes every few minutes, I guess.
7280019	7282561	It's the Final Fantasy XI security token.
7283301	7288785	And, of course, the constantly changing login passwords will apparently protect your account from hackers.
7290386	7309918	and the only thing though is they haven't released a price for it yet but it will come with some in-game exclusive items when you purchase this token huh okay so you get special stuff in the actual game?
7310539	7316523	yes, you get like stuff in the game I'm still not interested in going back, sorry alright
7317829	7330520	One more story for you guys, then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio Oh, I was going to, real quickly, I was going to mention the Vanadio Collection Yeah, $14.99 now Oh my gosh, on Xbox 360?
7330840	7344191	And Windows Wow, they're really trying to get new crack addicts on that game Because, you know, you pay that once They might as well just give the game away Because you get 30 days for free with that And $14.99 is how much it costs a month, right?
7344211	7344311	Yeah
7346174	7348916	I'm surprised they haven't gone the route of just doing a downloadable demo, or have they?
7348976	7349717	And I just missed that.
7349937	7350237	I don't know.
7350257	7351518	Maybe they did, and I might have missed that.
7352018	7352238	All right.
7352758	7353719	Look, one more story for you guys.
7353739	7357421	Completely different side note here, but something also to kind of take a note.
7357461	7357962	Here's the thing.
7358862	7363545	This guy from a Yale University, he's a Yale University student, so you know he's smart.
7363865	7365446	His name is Jesse Myman.
7365686	7366267	Or it's connected.
7367168	7367728	Yeah, could be.
7368509	7373395	There's a report in the Cincinnati Inquirer that Jesse's a little pissed off because he flew U.S.
7373455	7379502	Airways and he was flying them in December from Connecticut to Ohio and they basically lost his Xbox 360.
7381249	7388292	He went to pick up his luggage after he landed and he noticed that everything was there except for the Xbox 360 and all the accompanying components.
7388673	7391734	So I'm assuming he believes that it was theft.
7392795	7397297	His suit says after that that he got weeks of an unconcessionable runaround.
7397857	7399318	So you know what happened next, right?
7400322	7402204	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7421647	7423048	I don't know why you're using the Xbox 360.
7423288	7424108	Well, I guess I can see that.
7424328	7426309	Upscale on the HD, right?
7426710	7427110	I guess.
7427430	7428290	But anyway, here's the thing.
7428891	7434694	He wants the airline to pay him $1,700 for the loss of the gaming system because apparently he probably had his own additions on it.
7434734	7435034	I don't know.
7435935	7438416	And for non-economic distress of at least $25,000.
7440457	7442658	But he's seeking the maximum, $1 million.
7443559	7444019	Go figure.
7444159	7445239	I don't know exactly how that works.
7445600	7446340	But here's the thing.
7447361	7449882	US Air would like to point out their policy state...
7451386	7460752	The federal loss limits are capped out at $3,300 per bag, and the airline's luggage policy excludes liability for electronics.
7461670	7462511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7482839	7485701	And then when the bag gets to wherever, they should have scaled it again.
7486001	7489042	Oh, there's a clear difference in weight in the bag.
7489062	7492924	I mean, those Xbox 360s weigh like 15 pounds, you know.
7493785	7495106	Obviously, they stole it.
7495246	7502329	I mean, there's no way that it didn't break during the flight, which I don't see really being the airline's fault.
7503590	7507032	SSJ100 Matt says I always bring my console on the plane with me or not at all
7523462	7530404	Deekman says if it was broken, yes, but it was stolen.
7531044	7534744	If you ask for a million, though, suddenly a settlement of $500,000 is looking pretty good.
7535165	7537025	So maybe this guy's just trying to highball it.
7537065	7537425	I don't know.
7537725	7538625	He is trying to highball it.
7539065	7542426	Gripper01 says God help Microsoft if it ever red rings.
7545147	7545747	What a good point.
7546966	7568730	So, alright If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio We're going to open up the Skype line Take a couple of calls Probably not too many tonight Because we are running a little long tonight But we also want to get to last minute stories here In just a little bit And all that fun stuff So go ahead and give us a call now We do have a call, we'll go to that Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
7570751	7573031	It's GS68 Hey, GS68, what's on your mind?
7574271	7576712	Hold on Okay, I'll wait
7578820	7580241	I got Gradius Rebirth this week.
7580722	7581382	What?
7582863	7584144	I got Gradius Rebirth this week.
7584404	7586306	It came out this Monday, much to my surprise.
7588308	7589388	Oh, Gradius 3.
7589889	7592351	Tell us, or wait, Gradius Rebirth or Gradius 3?
7592471	7594512	Rebirth.
7595293	7597275	Tell us a little bit about Gradius Rebirth.
7597655	7598896	I'm going to put you on with Loki here.
7598916	7600057	I've got to take care of something in the studio.
7601258	7601658	Alright then.
7604760	7607382	So tell us about the game.
7607402	7607983	What do you think of it?
7609366	7619990	Yeah, basically it's a new Drydance title, and it looks more like a 16-bit or 32-bit Drydance game, kind of like Drydance 3, or a bit like Drydance Gaiden.
7620170	7627813	And it's basically a remix, it's more or less a remix of older Drydance games rather than a completely new title.
7627893	7637457	Like, I'm watching a replay of my soft right now, and my replay's on stage 2, which looks like a level from the MSX and MSS games.
7641405	7641706	Okay.
7642766	7643387	Sounds pretty cool.
7644047	7647209	Yeah, it's only five stages, though.
7648911	7655855	For 1,000 weak points, that might turn off a few players, but as a driving fan, I just had to get this game.
7657136	7667904	And one of my favorite things is on stage one, there are two enemies, and if you destroy either one first, you can change the entire stage depending on which enemy.
7667964	7668324	It's sort of like
7669201	7676126	If you don't destroy either, the stage continues as normal, but if you destroy the top enemy, the stage becomes frozen.
7676286	7680670	If you destroy the bottom enemy, all the weapons in the stage become active and the stage gets harder.
7681991	7682251	Huh.
7682931	7683512	That's kind of neat.
7683932	7684192	Yeah.
7686474	7695481	And then, um, looking at the weapon arrangement for the game, you have the usual, like, regular missile and double and laser.
7696362	7696802	And then you have...
7697972	7706324	Another one where you have a bomb attack and then a twin laser that's weaker than the... It's not as powerful as the regular laser, but it shoots faster.
7707105	7714295	And then there's two unlockable setups that are more or less for more challenging players, I guess.
7718217	7718997	Well, it sounds pretty cool.
7719057	7720758	I was actually kind of thinking of checking this out.
7721678	7723518	I just haven't gotten a chance to download it yet.
7724198	7730840	That and that new one that's coming out on Monday here, BitTrip, or was it BitTrip Beat or whatever.
7731200	7732020	It looks pretty awesome.
7732760	7745183	But hopefully, you know, I know they've been probably a little bit inspired by the Mega Man 9 stuff, so hopefully we see more of these retro remakes that aren't exactly, you know, retro, I guess.
7745203	7745283	Yeah.
7747253	7748233	That's kind of cool.
7748253	7748353	Yeah.
7748373	7749294	You know, I always... Hmm.
7772768	7774069	I hope they bring some of this stuff out.
7775029	7779371	They should do a Gradius collection on DS or something.
7779391	7782893	They have a Gradius collection on PSP in Japan.
7783093	7784753	I know, but they have it here too.
7784773	7786214	They have a Proteus collection.
7787555	7788955	But they need it on DS as well.
7789976	7795898	I want to sell them at a collection, but the fact that my old PSP has a crappy D-pad is turning me off from it.
7799700	7801601	And I don't want to get a new PSP because then I'll
7802625	7806726	because then I have to restart my DJ Max save files because they're locked to the current PSP.
7812007	7812427	Well, cool.
7813207	7815508	Is there any other WiiWare games you're looking forward to checking out?
7818668	7820349	Don't think so.
7820429	7822869	I have a few favorites that I want to buy eventually.
7823149	7825790	I have a few older games that I eventually want to buy.
7825810	7825890	Cool.
7831997	7833458	So, crisis averted?
7835920	7836261	I guess.
7836761	7840244	Oh, no, we have Rob trying to find his microphone.
7840624	7841965	Yes, we're back to normal, sorry.
7842085	7848090	But I'm sorry I missed the review, but let me just quickly ask for a summary.
7848130	7849891	Is it worth breaking my boycott over?
7851813	7852213	Hmm.
7853014	7859940	It's certainly not the best... Well, it depends on what game is enough to make you break your boycott.
7859980	7860240	I mean...
7862698	7865679	There's more of a game for hardcore Guardians fans like V.I.N.
7866379	7870961	Most people forget the fact that it's only five stages and it doesn't really add much to the series.
7870981	7875343	I have to wipe Defender Castle to get this game.
7894124	7894544	We'll see.
7894744	7895105	We'll see.
7895165	7896406	I do love Defend Your Castle, though.
7896426	7899107	All right, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for the review.
7899127	7900068	Sorry I wasn't here to hear it all.
7900628	7900889	All right.
7901489	7901949	It's cool.
7902169	7902510	Later.
7902750	7903170	All right, see ya.
7904791	7912756	We had like an insect outbreak here in studio because a piece of my sandwich fell on the ground, so all the ants rose up from the ground and were like, rise from the grave.
7912896	7914397	Rise from your grave.
7914478	7917740	And so they all decided to, yeah, have a piece of that.
7917760	7919521	I thought it was cute how you took care of it.
7919878	7921439	Well, I took care of it right away, right?
7921559	7923641	Alright, let's take a couple more calls here tonight.
7923661	7924661	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
7924681	7925042	Who's this?
7925842	7926663	Hey, that was pretty quick.
7926723	7927483	It's me, Ranma.
7927624	7928524	Hi, Ranma.
7928584	7930466	Hey, what's up everyone?
7930546	7931066	Not much.
7931326	7932287	We're ant-free now.
7932327	7932667	What's up?
7933788	7939332	I just want you guys to know that I took one for the team two weeks ago, and I want some type of compensation for it.
7939492	7940793	Oh dear, what's this about?
7940833	7942154	We don't have compensation.
7942254	7944596	We don't get compensated, so this has got to be good.
7945859	7950500	I actually sat there and watched Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li
7971994	7978818	I mean, they made the movie a little bit too realistic, and I don't care if I give spoilers or not, because that's how bad this movie was.
7980219	7985303	Number one, Bison should not be walking around in a mustache and a goatee.
7986924	7987344	Okay.
7988104	7995329	Number two, Vega's mask should not look like a cross between Vader and Shy Guy.
7997010	7997150	Ew.
7998411	7999692	Number three,
8000402	8008669	In the fight sequence in the club, Chun-Li could have at least had on some type of blue dress or something to signify her traditional outfit, you know?
8008969	8015174	And how the hell does she have injuries on her when you didn't look like she had any in the movie when she was fighting?
8018196	8018617	I don't know.
8020178	8021519	Not for nothing, I'll say this.
8022060	8026183	After seeing this movie, the original Street Fighter is ten times better...
8026963	8031025	and I am so looking forward to Dragon Ball Evolution after this.
8035467	8040289	I don't know, it doesn't look, well, Dragon Ball Evolution doesn't look as bad.
8041970	8045892	Pretty much, I'm just saying, I think after seeing this, that's gonna be a lot better.
8047432	8049413	Do you think it's a shoo-in to win all the Razzie Awards next year?
8049433	8050413	No, I don't think it's that bad.
8050453	8050634	Now, if U.A.
8050654	8052354	Boyle had anything to do with it, by default, it would.
8052374	8052474	Okay.
8052494	8052955	Do you think U.A.
8052995	8053855	Boyle makes better movies than this?
8077151	8100827	I can make better movies than this and I have an amateur digital camcorder I got from Joe Dea that I'm borrowing well congratulations there are my sister who is a who's graduating from Hofstra has a degree in filming she can do something better than this I've seen her do better work than this you know
8103695	8112617	Well, you know, every actor, every director usually has a stinker somewhere in their career, so what can you do?
8114377	8120399	I know, I know, and it does help the fact that my roommate's a big Chun-Li fan, and I warned him, so, yeah.
8121279	8125920	Well, you know, we all told you it would suck, and I have yet to hear anybody say it's good.
8126000	8127720	I want to hear a good review on this movie.
8128220	8129761	You're asking for a little too much there.
8132571	8132951	I think it is.
8132971	8135092	Somebody just linked Rotten Tomatoes there in chat.
8135112	8138234	I'm going to look at this and see if it still has a 0% from all the critics out there.
8139755	8141315	I don't want to see your stupid ad.
8141355	8141615	Come on.
8144057	8145357	I'm skipping the ad right now.
8145457	8147518	Yeah, I'm trying to skip it too, but it's so freaking slow.
8148779	8149079	Alright.
8151580	8149079	4%.
8152581	8154382	Somebody gave it a positive review.
8155379	8175638	Here it is from Variety, of course it's Variety Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from video games, Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to oogle besides the titular heroine Huh Well, there you go A whopping 4% on Rotten Tomatoes Well, Ranma, nobody forced you to watch it, I don't know what to tell you
8176354	8177094	I was bored.
8177174	8177754	What can I tell you?
8177774	8178975	And I couldn't get any alcohol.
8179275	8181775	No compensation for Morris Launch Radio.
8181895	8182175	Sorry.
8182615	8186796	Our compensation is go watch Silent Hill again and see a good game movie.
8187836	8188657	Yes.
8189437	8191497	Or the original Mortal Kombat if you ask me.
8191697	8193738	The first Mortal Kombat was fantastic.
8193758	8194298	Yeah, it's not bad.
8194318	8194938	Yes, it was.
8195258	8200599	I would even say it was really close to theme.
8201059	8204860	The second one is Life I Wish I Had Back.
8206263	8207664	I hope the third one comes out someday.
8209386	8211828	Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
8211989	8212709	Take care, buddy, okay?
8213070	8213410	You too.
8213450	8214191	Alright, later everyone.
8215192	8216793	We'll try to do at least one more call here.
8216813	8218255	Do we have any last minute stories?
8218555	8219536	DarkSakura, I know you had one.
8222359	8223019	You alright over there?
8224160	8226923	DarkSakura's going to hopefully give us a last minute story here.
8228124	8230727	Anyway, I'm glad the microphone didn't catch that.
8231220	8231540	Hey, this is Ray.
8231560	8232721	This is actually my first time calling.
8232741	8234762	I've been listening to this show for four years now, I guess.
8235042	8235402	Four years now.
8235422	8235802	I've missed once.
8235822	8236162	Oh, Ray.
8236863	8237003	R-A-Y?
8237703	8237943	R-A-Y?
8237963	8240284	Yeah, it's my real name, heaven forbid.
8240304	8240504	Okay.
8240544	8241305	Well, what is up, Ray?
8260172	8261292	Uh, nothing really.
8261332	8263033	It's 11 o'clock on spring break.
8263073	8267594	All my friends are away, so I have nothing to do but stay up until 11 o'clock and listen to this show.
8267614	8268294	I love it.
8268634	8269534	I don't think I've missed a week.
8269954	8270894	Well, thank you very much.
8270954	8272835	We appreciate you listening to the show.
8273035	8275255	Did you hear something on tonight's show that you wanted to comment on?
8275295	8275915	Any of the stories?
8276955	8277576	Yeah, actually.
8278356	8279436	Indie games, pretty much.
8280916	8287758	I can't remember any specifics, because I was just thinking of something to call about, so I'm not just here babbling like an idiot on the internet, but Cave Story.
8288018	8288618	Has anyone played it?
8288638	8289738	I'm pretty sure Loki might have
8291281	8293303	Um, no, tell us a little more about this game.
8293623	8294644	I don't think I've heard of this.
8295885	8296665	Ah, Cave Story.
8296685	8298607	You haven't heard of Cave Story?
8299347	8299588	Mm-mm.
8300148	8300989	It's a PC title.
8301069	8301809	It's pretty cool.
8302050	8303090	Oh, I guess Loki knows it.
8303651	8304011	Oh, okay.
8304872	8318182	It is coming to the Wii, that's why I brought it up, because it's getting a graphical redesign, but on the PC, it's free, it's translated from Japanese, and it's kind of a, I want to say classic-style shooter, sort of like Mega Man, but
8319231	8321574	No wait, I'm lying, no, it's a little easier.
8322114	8324517	Because I beat it, and I'm not that good at Mega Man games.
8325838	8330924	I thought I'd notice that Google Cave Story or English Translation should come up in one of the first few topics.
8331755	8341182	Well, our chat room sure seems to know this game, and I'm actually trying to look up a little bit online to see if I know anything about this, and sadly, no, I don't know how I missed this.
8341262	8342463	I guess I just, I'm not cool.
8342483	8344144	I've talked about Cave Story before.
8344244	8344564	Have you?
8344724	8345705	Yeah, a couple times.
8345725	8346766	We talk about a lot of games on the show.
8346786	8348087	I don't care for it, but it's neat.
8348547	8350949	I guess they're making a version on PSP as well, it looks like?
8351309	8351870	Homebrew.
8351950	8353571	Oh, it's a homebrew project.
8354211	8354692	Oh, okay.
8355592	8356573	Huh, interesting, though.
8356953	8357774	How did you find this game?
8357814	8358014	Definitely.
8359772	8366133	I was looking through a list of homebrew PSP games and I found it there and I learned more about it and had a PC version which is really good.
8367294	8367734	Really good.
8368194	8370614	They're the same game almost but it looks bigger, better.
8371555	8378616	I don't know why... Is it just me or does this game look very old school 8-bit NES style graphics?
8379676	8380477	Precisely.
8381577	8386378	Another thing I wanted to mention was Team Fortress 2 had an 8-bit demake
8388255	8389275	Gang Garrison 2.
8391376	8392196	I have not seen this.
8393357	8397358	Oh, it's a side-scrolling isometric shooter, but it's team-based online.
8397418	8401380	It's anywhere from 10 players at a time to 100 players at a time.
8402860	8404621	Yeah, you can play as all nine major classes.
8405901	8411343	It's kind of simplified, but there's still techniques to it, like the Pyro has the puffer instead of the backburner.
8411383	8412964	There's none of the special extra weapons.
8413484	8416965	And you can deflect rockets back, and 50-on-50 matches are crazy.
8417751	8420214	I've been installed on the computer lab at my school.
8420495	8421015	It's pretty neat.
8421616	8422477	Do they let you do that?
8424320	8428625	We have a kind of lax administrator and we put it on thumb drives anyway, so it's alright.
8428665	8429526	It's only 5 megs.
8430247	8430568	Gotcha.
8431024	8431524	Alright, alright.
8433065	8433586	Here's my question.
8433846	8439950	I noticed you mentioned this game as a demake and we've talked about, I know last week's show we were talking about like a Final Fantasy X demake and some of this stuff.
8440290	8447795	What do you think makes these demakes so popular where people go back in time and remake games such as like Team Fortress 2 or whatever the game is.
8448055	8453139	Why do you think people want to keep remaking or Guitar Hero has had tons of these like in the Commodore 64 and stuff.
8453499	8456181	Why do people want to remake these games on old systems?
8456261	8457642	What do you think is the allure of it?
8459042	8459843	Well, it's kind of like
8460387	8462728	Almost the opposite of the, what was that?
8464688	8476731	I think it's the opposite of, say, just a second here, how Mega Man X, one of the later X games, took the classic Mega Man action to a pseudo-3D view.
8477692	8481773	It's sort of strange seeing a new medium exactly like with the Guitar Hero Commodore remake.
8483073	8483233	Hmm.
8485495	8485815	I don't know.
8486075	8487616	I don't get into a whole lot of these.
8487896	8494620	I don't know if I necessarily... Usually I'm just kind of like, oh, hmm, that's neat, but I don't really have to play the whole thing in its entirety.
8494720	8498762	So it's kind of interesting that there's this whole kind of community around there, around the demakes.
8499422	8500783	I always thought it was interesting.
8501143	8502664	There's a Silent Hill 2 demake.
8502804	8505545	I think it was like Soundless Mountain 2.
8506306	8506726	Really?
8506866	8507586	For what system?
8507666	8507967	I know.
8509327	8509747	PC.
8510468	8510748	Huh.
8511528	8512009	Interesting.
8512029	8514490	Google TIG source.
8515202	8518024	I don't know how they pulled that off.
8518064	8518465	Dig Dug Demake?
8518485	8521567	Wasn't Dig Dug kind of an old-ass game to begin with?
8521587	8521687	Huh.
8521707	8521887	Wow.
8521927	8524649	I'm pretty sure they had a Bioshock Demake, too.
8544690	8546872	No, I've seen the Bioshock demake.
8546952	8547393	Interesting.
8547553	8548213	Wow, there's a whole lot.
8548774	8551697	And again, lots of positive feedback to Cave Story in our chatroom.
8552097	8555801	GameGuru says, but yeah, Cave Story is a Metroidvania worth buying and it's free on PC.
8556021	8557162	Any PC gamer should own it.
8558263	8559784	I might have to just seek that out.
8560265	8562247	So you found that amongst all the chat about Wang?
8563868	8564269	What?
8564929	8566911	No, I haven't been paying attention to chat.
8566931	8567151	Sorry.
8568123	8569104	Well, I mean, I have, but I haven't.
8569544	8570644	What's the big deal with Wang?
8570844	8571225	Oh, nothing.
8571265	8572465	Just a discussion about Watchmen.
8572766	8573206	Oh, jeez.
8573746	8573986	All right.
8574426	8575327	Well, I saw Watchmen.
8575367	8576448	That was an amazing movie.
8576608	8577568	Did you read the comics?
8578669	8579609	I've read the comic.
8579949	8582431	They almost used the book as a shooting script.
8583251	8586853	I'm kind of disappointed it left out the death of the first night owl, but they had to make room.
8587353	8588374	Well, question for you.
8589334	8592396	Do you think the movie ending was better or the comic ending?
8592716	8594037	And don't spoil it, because I haven't seen it.
8594057	8594557	Don't spoil it.
8594597	8595418	Just say which one you prefer.
8596405	8599187	I honestly think that the movie ending better fits the audience today.
8599207	8599767	That's my opinion.
8599787	8602248	Without going into how hokey the comic one was.
8602268	8603349	All my friends gave it bad reviews.
8603369	8604890	They went in there expecting Spider-Man or Dark Knight.
8627521	8629403	It's its own thing.
8629423	8630764	No, this is R-rated, folks.
8631404	8633186	The movie ending doesn't make any sense.
8634087	8634607	Yes, it does.
8634847	8635288	No, it doesn't.
8635308	8636008	Did you read the comics?
8636149	8636609	Yes, I did.
8638791	8640332	Difference of opinion.
8640352	8644996	It doesn't make any sense because... I will go see it and be the Tyvo.
8645016	8648459	Without trying to explain too much of the ending of the movie...
8649858	8650319	Thanks for watching!
8663732	8665713	Except that it happened within the one country, too.
8665854	8666754	I'm so confused right now.
8666774	8667515	It doesn't matter, though.
8668195	8668475	Anyway.
8668635	8668896	All right.
8669576	8670477	We'll let them argue later.
8670557	8671597	Another discussion.
8671637	8673319	We should do a movie cast.
8673359	8673679	Someday.
8673719	8674359	Maybe as a one-off.
8674419	8676200	We should call it Ultimate Spoiler Cast.
8677321	8677581	All right.
8678102	8680703	Ray, I've got to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show.
8680763	8684066	But thanks so much, and I hope you had a good time on your first call.
8684086	8685086	And call again sometime, okay?
8685887	8686107	All right.
8686127	8686227	Sweet.
8686267	8687068	I'll call back next week.
8687248	8687508	All right.
8687568	8687948	Later, dude.
8688148	8689850	We may not be here next week, but in two weeks.
8690910	8691231	All right.
8691251	8691311	Bye.
8691451	8691651	All right.
8691691	8691851	Later.
8691871	8691971	Later.
8693368	8694409	We like first-time callers.
8694450	8696011	That's a good note to end on tonight, I think.
8696091	8697593	So sorry, guys, who didn't get through.
8697613	8698955	We're going to close up the Skype line for now.
8699676	8703981	You can always send us emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, or, of course, we will continue to read chat comments throughout the night.
8704261	8705442	We still have some last-minute stories.
8705723	8710248	DarkSakura, I'm sorry we didn't get to you, but, hey, if I hadn't taken that call, it wouldn't have been a first-time caller.
8710889	8712631	I wouldn't have been burping.
8714173	8722676	Okay, so there is a marketing stunt that went kind of nuts.
8723416	8729978	And it was actually by Monument PR for Friday the 13th for the launch of Resident Evil 5.
8731138	8733419	And basically the big stunt was a treasure hunt.
8734359	8744447	Um, where about 50 members of the public would go and retrieve arms, legs, heads, and torsos from a number of different areas.
8745568	8748751	Um, so, um,
8751371	8755896	It was basically part of the big campaign.
8756596	8761261	So they hid all the body parts within a square mile of London.
8761762	8764805	Like in bins and on window ledges.
8765145	8766126	And 100 people signed up.
8769169	8770631	So basically...
8772899	8779868	It actually said that the people paying attention to it, passers-by, complained to the police.
8780529	8786697	And officers were there at the finishing line to greet the people who were trying to assemble the bodies.
8786877	8788579	So it's...
8790921	8794184	I read about this earlier in the week and the whole thing sounded stupid.
8794264	8795725	It did look kind of gross.
8796125	8801430	There's just certain things that you gotta wonder who the hell thought this was a good idea, right?
8802010	8802631	Maybe it was just me.
8803471	8803792	I don't know.
8804252	8807735	Loki, well thank you to our emailer and to Jamie for that one.
8807815	8808876	Loki, did you have anything tonight?
8809475	8810516	Just some small stuff.
8811236	8818421	Watchmen The End of Nigh 2 has been announced, and apparently it is more of the same.
8818601	8822544	However, it's supposed to be a little bit racier.
8822884	8829608	Apparently it's been rated by the ESRB and describes some sexual content in there, including... Nice.
8830088	8832190	There's... Let's see here.
8834111	8836973	Well, basically the sexual content, I guess, is the more racier part.
8837553	8838574	Oh, I don't know the blue peen.
8839591	8841212	Well, that's not necessarily in there.
8841692	8850575	As a Watchmen, I guess you'll fight in a strip club that includes go-go dancers in cages, peep show booths, and a pornographic film in the background.
8852276	8857798	However, in case you haven't played the first Watchmen, it sucks.
8858118	8860659	And so if it's more of the same, it's more of the suck.
8860879	8861779	So don't buy it.
8863220	8864160	Or at least try the demo.
8866042	8874128	Um, apparently Peter Moore of EA is saying that Wii Motion Plus is going to put an end to lazy Wiimote gaming.
8874808	8885256	Um, apparently the 1.1 motion capture that is part of Wii Motion Plus requires you to actually make the full swing when playing a golf game or a tennis game.
8885276	8887357	You can't just, like, move your wrists a little bit.
8888818	8891860	Which is great, because that will encourage more people to throw stuff through their TV.
8892321	8892721	Sweet.
8894242	8894322	Um,
8895339	8899483	Now of course we talked about earlier a free PopCap game you can get on St.
8899523	8907431	Paddy's Day, but of course there's going to be some more stuff coming out as well, including LittleBigPlanet is going to be giving away a free St.
8907551	8909073	Paddy's Day costume.
8910154	8918682	That'll include a beard, a shiny green suit, a green top hat, and other stuff to make your character look like a leprechaun.
8920164	8925308	Also, in April, there's going to be another free costume that's a Monkey King costume.
8925348	8930912	Apparently, it was the winning entry of the PlayStation Asia contest, the design costume contest.
8931492	8940599	And then there's some more paid costumes coming out later, including a Killzone minipack, Buzz minipack, Patapon costume, and a Heavenly Sword minipack as well.
8941941	8943542	But I want some more damn expansions.
8943562	8944382	That's what I want.
8945303	8947185	More stuff like Metal Gear Solid, because that's awesome.
8948100	8952165	And then finally, Resident Evil 5 is already going to get some download content.
8952566	8954088	The versus download content.
8954208	8955610	It's been dated in Japan.
8956391	8960256	It's going to be available for 250 yen and 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live.
8960296	8960937	It is...
8966783	8967063	That is it.
8967083	8967303	All right.
8988700	8989941	DarkSakura, I'll start with you.
8989961	8990901	Your final thought.
8990941	8991082	Blarg.
8991102	8994063	My final thought is Cherry 7-Up is delicious, and I've had two cans tonight during the show.
8994083	8994764	That can't be healthy.
8994804	8995364	Loki, your final thought.
8995404	8996405	My final thought is Peggle is fun.
9017362	9018643	Alright, that's going to do it.
