16000	19000	Will OnLive be the next great console?
19000	22000	Could Netflix come out for PlayStation 3 and Wii?
22000	26000	And the classic 8-bit game is re-released for the iPhone
26000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
33000	36000	And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	38000	We're back after a week vacation
38000	41000	To talk more about video games, video gaming, gaming culture
41000	43000	And the gamer lifestyle
43000	45000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week
45000	47000	As well as my awesome co-hosts
47000	50000	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
50000	51000	Hi
51000	52000	How are you, Miss Jamie Summers?
52000	53000	I am
53000	56000	You are, because you is? I don't know
56000	57000	I be
57000	58000	Because you be
58000	60000	Alright, also joining us tonight
60000	62000	Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
62000	63000	Hi, how's it going?
63000	64000	Good, how are you?
64000	66000	Could have been better, because
66000	67000	Yeah?
67000	69000	Yeah, Adobe Bro...
69000	72000	I don't know what it is, it's just like an ongoing theme of my laptop
73000	76000	An update from the manufacturer
76000	78000	Like, for example, Microsoft's update or whatever
78000	80000	Or Adobe, even Flash
80000	82000	Is breaking something
82000	84000	So, like, Windows update broke my computer
84000	86000	And I had to actually reinstall everything
86000	90000	And now, Flash update broke the Flash media encoder
90000	92000	Yeah, just to kind of explain a little bit for listeners
92000	94000	Especially those on the podcast
94000	96000	We do tape live, obviously
96000	98000	And live radio has interesting advantages
98000	100000	As in, we get to interact with you guys live
100000	102000	And disadvantages, as to things don't always work the way we plan
102000	104000	So, Loki is trying to show
104000	106000	Something on
106000	108000	Justin.tv, our video feed
108000	110000	Which we'll get into a little bit later
110000	112000	But he wants to do it, because for whatever reason
112000	114000	His laptop is not, suddenly decided
114000	116000	It didn't want to cooperate with the video anymore
116000	118000	Yeah, it wants to do audio, but no video
118000	120000	Yeah, it's weird, so
120000	122000	But you know, this type of thing is not limited to PCs
122000	124000	I'll tell you what, my laptop, my MacBook
124000	126000	Has been out of commission for, like, a month
126000	128000	Because an Apple update
128000	130000	Screwed up my boot up
130000	132000	Like, it'll get to the gray screen
132000	134000	And I get the spinning wheel, and it just freezes there
134000	136000	And from everything I've been told
136000	138000	I just need to reinstall OS X
138000	140000	I don't know where the hell I put it
140000	142000	I bought my laptop a year and a half ago
142000	144000	Yeah, stupid me for losing it, right
144000	146000	But now I have to find a friend's disk
146000	148000	To install it off of
148000	150000	So, yeah, I'm out of, I can't use a laptop right now
150000	152000	So, stinks
152000	154000	Alright
154000	156000	So anyhow, let's get into
156000	158000	Some, how was your gaming week?
158000	160000	We always like to start off the show with
160000	162000	How was your gaming week, so let's do that
162000	164000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
164000	166000	For a little while, it actually was non-existent
166000	168000	Given that I had a mid-term
168000	170000	Last week, and lots of school crap
170000	172000	To do
172000	174000	But I did actually
174000	176000	Play Cooking Mama for
176000	178000	iPhone, which is
178000	180000	It's only got a few recipes
180000	182000	On it, so it's super short
182000	184000	But I like the control on it better than on the DS
184000	186000	It was actually pretty fun
186000	188000	So that's one game that translates itself very
188000	190000	Very well for iPhone
190000	192000	And for those that don't remember, DarkSakura loves her Cooking Mama
192000	194000	On DS
194000	196000	And
196000	198000	I actually downloaded another game
198000	200000	That let me find the name of it
200000	202000	Because it's also on iPhone
202000	204000	Really, a lot of my gaming has been iPhone-based lately
204000	206000	Except for Last Night, which I'll get into
206000	208000	In just a second
208000	210000	It's called LightBike, and it's a free
210000	212000	Lightcycle game
212000	214000	Like in Tron
214000	216000	So it's pretty cool
216000	218000	And then
218000	220000	I wouldn't say this is a game, but it's a fun little app
220000	222000	As I've been playing with my koi pond lately
222000	224000	And
224000	226000	Also, as I'm
226000	228000	Being reminded
228000	230000	Via hint, hint, hint
230000	232000	Is I did actually
232000	234000	Review Cooking Mama
234000	236000	On AvengersTower.com
236000	238000	So if you want to check it out
238000	240000	You can see my full review there
240000	242000	No, wait a minute, not Orangelaunchradio.com
242000	244000	You review games over on
244000	246000	Giggling Girls site, but you won't do it
246000	248000	I'll copy it over! I'm just messing
248000	250000	We're getting Tiara over, hopefully to do game reviews
250000	252000	As well, right? For us
252000	254000	Hopefully, yes, thumbs up, good
254000	256000	There is hope in the positive direction
256000	260000	She plays a lot of games I never get around to playing
260000	262000	So I like reading her reviews
262000	264000	Last night was all about
264000	266000	The Rufus Belly
266000	268000	For Street Fighter IV
268000	270000	No, last night at my house
270000	272000	Oh lordy
272000	274000	We got it on with video games
274000	276000	In a big way
276000	278000	My husband and I, and no it wasn't anything kinky
278000	280000	Got it on, huh?
280000	282000	With video games? Sick
282000	284000	Hush, hush, hush
284000	286000	Last night we decided
286000	288000	We were going to totally
288000	290000	Go for the PC Engine fun
290000	292000	So we broke out our PC Engine
292000	294000	Core graphics
294000	296000	So we could play our Japanese Hu-Cards
296000	298000	And then we broke out the
298000	300000	Turbo Duo
300000	302000	Which we've got to play the import
302000	304000	CDs
304000	306000	We found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone
306000	308000	We're so happy
308000	310000	My copy of Space Fantasy Zone however
310000	312000	Has a hole in it
312000	314000	Not a hole where the spindle goes
314000	316000	But a hole in the disc
316000	318000	Therefore we got to the first
318000	320000	Boss
320000	322000	How does that even happen? I don't know
322000	324000	There's shit in my house
324000	326000	We got to the first boss and is like
326000	328000	Game over, I quit, you win
328000	330000	Game over, no more
330000	332000	And for people who don't know
332000	334000	Space Fantasy Zone
334000	336000	Because the
336000	338000	Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone
338000	340000	Are set in the same universe
340000	342000	It's basically Fantasy Zone from the
342000	344000	Space Harrier behind the
344000	346000	Player perspective
346000	348000	So it's pretty cool
348000	350000	And it has remixes of
350000	352000	All the old Fantasy Zone music done in
352000	354000	Sort of that Space Harrier style
354000	356000	And I'll have to
356000	358000	Actually bring you tracks to play
358000	360000	On this show sometime Rob, they're really cool
360000	362000	And so
362000	364000	I went, now this game is also
364000	366000	A prototype, they did not release
366000	368000	It, they had just like
368000	370000	Base cover artwork for it and it never
370000	372000	As far as I'm aware, never got
372000	374000	An official release and so
374000	376000	I've been racking my brain trying
376000	378000	To find some way to burn
378000	380000	A new copy of the game but hell
380000	382000	If I know how to burn multi session you know
382000	384000	Audio and
384000	386000	Data weird compilation
386000	388000	I found how to do it but it's a lot of hard work
388000	390000	And I'm lazy
390000	392000	Let me read some comments from chat real quick
392000	394000	Here at chat.orangelandradio.com
394000	396000	If you're listening live on this Sunday evening
396000	398000	Here on All Games Radio where we broadcast every Sunday night
398000	400000	Live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time
400000	402000	9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time
402000	404000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
404000	406000	We chat at chat.orangelandradio.com
406000	408000	And there's of course some comments to
408000	410000	DarkSakura talking about the
410000	412000	Hole in her disc
412000	414000	Goldanthro in chat says a hole in the disc?
414000	416000	Mmm disc sex
416000	418000	Since you know you're talking about getting it on and all
418000	420000	Andrew says holy disc
420000	422000	But he forgot
422000	424000	He forgot the Batman part. Holy disc Batman
424000	426000	To be specific
426000	428000	It wasn't actually a physical hole through it
428000	430000	I found out
430000	432000	But somehow or another on both sides of the
432000	434000	Disc
434000	436000	The
436000	438000	Covering on it had been scratched
438000	440000	Off
440000	442000	So maybe it's just something that
442000	444000	It was clamped on
444000	446000	Or poked on or something I don't know
446000	448000	In a box or something I have no idea
448000	450000	By the way the chat is also reminding me
450000	452000	Since you're talking about getting it
452000	454000	Since you're talking about getting it on with video games
454000	456000	And all that I forgot to play something before the show tonight
456000	458000	The following program is intended
458000	460000	For mature audiences
460000	462000	And there you go
462000	464000	Just so you know don't say we didn't warn you
464000	466000	Alright anything else in your gaming week besides such
466000	468000	Nerdy PC Engine retro
468000	470000	Fun? Oh there's a lot more
470000	472000	Well it was all PC Engine though nerdy
472000	474000	Fun
474000	476000	So we took off some of the games that we're playing
476000	478000	We put in Dracula X, Ys, Book 1 and 2
478000	480000	Freaking epic
480000	482000	Um
482000	484000	We played Legend of the Valkyries
484000	486000	Son Son
486000	488000	Twinbee, we broke out our copy of
488000	490000	Twinbee
490000	492000	And um
492000	494000	What else did we play? God
494000	496000	Cause I put pictures up on the gallery
496000	498000	I took a picture of my foot next to our
498000	500000	PC Engine core graphics
500000	502000	So you can see how little the PC Engine core graphics
502000	504000	Are on my foot
504000	506000	We also played
506000	508000	Final lap
508000	510000	Twin
510000	512000	Victory run
512000	514000	Keith Courage, no we didn't play Keith Courage
514000	516000	Cause that game is crap
516000	518000	Adventure Island, we played Adventure Island
518000	520000	Which is pretty fun
520000	522000	So yeah we were getting on with the
522000	524000	Hudson play last night
524000	526000	It was pretty cool
526000	528000	Good times
528000	530000	Lots of classic gaming
530000	532000	Alright folks before we get into Loki's
532000	534000	Gaming week here
534000	536000	Justin TV is now up if you're listening live
536000	538000	And Loki I'm assuming you're going to talk about what's going on here on Justin TV
538000	540000	While you're talking about your gaming week
540000	542000	Yeah basically
542000	544000	Like I said I've been playing Grand Theft Auto
544000	546000	Mainly Lost in Damned cause that's all I play
546000	548000	But um
548000	550000	Oh yeah I forgot
550000	552000	This is my bosses 360
552000	554000	Well technically it's my 360 but it's the one that he
554000	556000	Uses cause I own 5 of them
556000	558000	For some reason but this is my old 360
558000	560000	It's modded
560000	562000	So I figured out how to hack
562000	564000	Grand Theft Auto 4
564000	566000	Basically because
566000	568000	Rockstar is so lazy when it comes to
568000	570000	Programming that they literally use
570000	572000	Files that have been around since you know
572000	574000	Oh and it froze
574000	576000	For a second there
576000	578000	Phone call
578000	580000	Anyway so basically
580000	582000	Uses the same PC files and stuff
582000	584000	So you can edit it the same way as you'd edit
584000	586000	Like you know handling files and that kind of thing
586000	588000	So for example I can
588000	590000	Kick that motorcycle really hard
590000	592000	And it will go flying
592000	594000	Cause I edited
594000	596000	The physics
596000	598000	The punching and stuff it's just fun
598000	600000	Cause my boss he's
600000	602000	Oh they're going into orbit
602000	604000	They seriously will punch a person into flying into orbit
604000	606000	Here I know this is horrible
606000	608000	Oh my god they just disappeared
608000	610000	Like
610000	612000	Sorry I know this is crappy radio
612000	614000	That's awesome
614000	616000	That is fantastic
616000	618000	I love it
618000	620000	I'm sure this will be in the archives as well
620000	622000	For those listening on the radio
622000	624000	We'll play it during break
624000	626000	But there's a lot more stuff you can tweak
626000	628000	Basically you can edit it like you can edit the PC version
628000	630000	If you know how to do it
630000	632000	And yeah
632000	634000	We've played it online
634000	636000	Between the five of us
636000	638000	That play Grand Theft Auto
638000	640000	My boss he needs all the help he can get
640000	642000	And you can't actually cheat
642000	644000	Because it's funny the way the game works
644000	646000	Say for example we originally
646000	648000	Beefed up his weapons
648000	650000	To make him really overpowered
650000	652000	Because he kind of needs that help
652000	654000	And we got a weird side effect
654000	656000	Was anybody that got near him
656000	658000	Would get the same kind of upgrades
658000	660000	To their weapons
660000	662000	So it kind of cancels each other out
662000	664000	The only thing that doesn't affect
664000	666000	Vehicle handling if he gets into a bus
666000	668000	They're basically like rockets now
668000	670000	They just go really fast and smash through everything
670000	672000	That won't affect other people
672000	674000	And also physics on the weapons
674000	676000	Like the punching I was just doing
676000	678000	That won't affect other people
678000	680000	And if you try to punch another player that you're playing with
680000	682000	It won't affect them either
682000	684000	It'll just be like a normal punch
684000	686000	So it's basically just to fuck around with
686000	688000	And this one I made a new one
688000	690000	To kind of demonstrate some of the crazy crap you can do in it
690000	692000	But it's basically just like the PC version
692000	694000	Reading some comments from chat
694000	696000	Because the live chatters are kind of watching this whole thing
696000	698000	And maybe I can describe
698000	700000	This for the folks only listening to this on the podcast version
700000	702000	Dark Tetsuya says
702000	704000	So now it's Hancock the video game
704000	706000	Death Wishing says Falcon Punch
706000	708000	X-Link says
708000	710000	He's Siler
710000	712000	And Act F says Grand Theft Auto with Crackdown Physics
712000	714000	Cool freaking awesome
714000	716000	That was pretty hilarious
716000	718000	It's basically
718000	720000	You could potentially cheat
720000	722000	In the online games with this
722000	724000	But you'd be banned pretty quick
724000	726000	I'm guessing he's going to be banned eventually
726000	728000	But what do I care?
728000	730000	Because it's my boss, it's not me
732000	734000	And it's my modded console anyway
734000	736000	So what do I care?
736000	738000	But no
738000	740000	It's just a really fun experiment
740000	742000	As far as I'm aware
742000	744000	I'm sure other people have done it
744000	746000	But the only video I've seen online
746000	748000	There's only been one person that's done it
748000	750000	And he's the guy that actually made this program called OpenIV
750000	752000	Which is one of the programs that I use
752000	754000	It basically opens one of the files that's on
754000	756000	The actual Xbox 360 disc
756000	758000	And it's also part of the PC stuff
758000	760000	It's kind of like their version of a zip file or something
760000	762000	So
762000	764000	I kind of figured out how to
764000	766000	Extract everything
766000	768000	It is tricky because if you change something
768000	770000	If you change certain bytes or whatever
770000	772000	The file size changes and it gets too big
772000	774000	But I actually overwrote
774000	776000	There's multiple languages on the disc
776000	778000	So I overwrote the Spanish language with the English language
778000	780000	Which was a lot smaller in file size
780000	782000	So I can edit whatever I want
782000	784000	And I can just pad it with a bunch of null bytes
784000	786000	But anyways, so beyond the Grand Theft Auto stuff
786000	788000	I did play other things
788000	790000	I can't stop playing PEGAL DS
790000	792000	And I really don't want to play it anymore
792000	794000	But I finished PEGAL
794000	796000	The regular PEGAL stuff on there
796000	798000	Now I unlocked PEGAL Knights
798000	800000	So I can play that
800000	802000	Which I think is basically the same thing as PEGAL
802000	804000	It's just everybody's now a superhero for some reason
804000	806000	Whatever
806000	808000	It's fun
808000	810000	Nellie hasn't gotten a chance to play it yet
810000	812000	So I don't know if she'd like it
812000	814000	But I don't know, it's fun
814000	816000	Just watch TV and play that game
816000	818000	And then I also tried TrackMania DS
818000	820000	Which is pretty good
820000	822000	But the only thing that kind of sucks about it
822000	824000	Is because the DS screens are so small
824000	826000	Your field of view is really small in the game
826000	828000	But other than that, it's basically just
828000	830000	The same as the PC version
830000	832000	Which is pretty awesome
832000	834000	So that's kind of cool
834000	836000	And then
836000	838000	I think that's about it really
838000	840000	I wanted to play a lot more games
840000	842000	I was meaning to install that new update
842000	844000	For the Wii
844000	846000	Not exactly the same way
846000	848000	As you'd normally update it
848000	850000	But, you know, special way
850000	852000	Because I got a 16GB card
852000	854000	To go with that
854000	856000	So maybe we'll hear some more about this next week
856000	858000	Yes, and then
858000	860000	By the way, Tigerclaw in chat says you should hack PEGAL
860000	862000	And put in some crazy ass physics
862000	864000	Just like you did in Grand Theft Auto
864000	866000	It's not as easy to hack other games
866000	868000	In Grand Theft Auto, if you literally extract
868000	870000	All the files that are in those compressors
870000	872000	It's exactly the same as what you see on the PC
872000	874000	Formats are the same
874000	876000	Files are actually somewhat the same
876000	878000	The only thing that's different is the texture files and stuff
878000	880000	But if you learn how to hack one
880000	882000	You can hack both versions
882000	884000	You probably can hack the PS3 version
884000	886000	If you figure out how they store it
886000	888000	I haven't been able to
888000	890000	And I really wanted to figure out how to get it to install
890000	892000	Because I can actually install that
892000	894000	To this hard drive
894000	896000	So you can do the game installations
896000	898000	On the new Xbox Experience
898000	900000	And yes, the disk I have obviously is modified
900000	902000	Because I had to burn a modified ISO
902000	904000	To get it to work
904000	906000	Because I'm editing it
906000	908000	But you can actually run it with the real disk
908000	910000	Once it's installed on the hard drive
910000	912000	Because all it does is check to make sure that disk is legit
912000	914000	And then it'll run wherever the hell you want
914000	916000	But I literally took apart my 360
916000	918000	One of the other five
918000	920000	To try to get it to install
920000	922000	I was actually going to do a disk swap
922000	924000	On the CD-ROM drive
924000	926000	I literally took the CD-ROM drive apart
926000	928000	Unfortunately that thing spins so fast
928000	930000	It's impossible to do that
930000	932000	But it's fun
932000	934000	It's cool
934000	936000	Repeat at your own risk
936000	938000	He's voiding all sorts of warranties
938000	940000	All sorts of warranties
940000	942000	If one of these Xboxes is E74
942000	944000	It's tough shit
944000	946000	And I'm not going to go post online how to do this
946000	948000	Basically
948000	950000	You can figure it out the same way
950000	952000	As you would modify a song in Guitar Hero
952000	954000	The information is out there
954000	956000	You just kind of have to figure it out
956000	958000	And really I don't want a lot of people
958000	960000	Just online cheating like hell
960000	962000	I'm not doing that
962000	964000	We do it for fun
964000	966000	For your own amusement
966000	968000	But as you can see
968000	970000	There's no way I'm faking this
970000	972000	Since it's lost and damned
972000	974000	There's no way to port that to the PC yet
974000	976000	It's just fun
976000	978000	I think you're going to play a little bit
978000	980000	On and off throughout the night
980000	982000	You might kind of pause as you're reading news stories
982000	984000	And so on but you can kind of watch the action
984000	986000	Go down at Justin TV
986000	988000	Which is also available, thanks to Dekeman
988000	990000	For reminding me, we have it in a little box now
990000	992000	On OrangeLawnTrader.com
992000	994000	I'm not used to it being right there on our homepage
994000	996000	But it is, so you can just look at OrangeLawnTrader.com
996000	998000	And you can read the reviews that were posted this week
998000	1000000	And watch Justin TV at the same time
1000000	1002000	It's pretty cool
1002000	1004000	My gaming week, we've been out for two weeks
1004000	1006000	I actually got caught up on quite a few games
1006000	1008000	And this challenge is just so adorable
1008000	1010000	On the Nintendo DS
1010000	1012000	I can't think of a better way to describe this game
1012000	1014000	It's really adorable
1014000	1016000	Basically what they did, they took a lot of like
1016000	1018000	Inspired 8-bit games
1018000	1020000	I mean they're all original, old-school retro games
1020000	1022000	That you play in this
1022000	1024000	But they all kind of are reminiscent of games you might have played
1024000	1026000	Back in the day
1026000	1028000	On the Nintendo Entertainment System
1028000	1030000	For instance, there's a racing game
1030000	1032000	That's kind of a little bit, I don't know, like Spy Hunter-ish
1032000	1034000	Just without the weapons
1034000	1036000	Kind of a Xanax-style shooter
1036000	1038000	As well as
1038000	1042000	Galaga
1042000	1044000	Has like a type of shooter in there as well
1044000	1046000	And there's an RPG
1046000	1048000	It's just a really cute little game
1048000	1050000	Basically the way the game works is that you
1050000	1052000	Are basically sucked into the life of a child in the 80s
1052000	1054000	Playing all these new games with a friend
1054000	1056000	And the cool thing is that
1056000	1058000	As you play through these challenges
1058000	1060000	You unlock little magazines
1060000	1062000	You know, you might have heard of this
1062000	1064000	These games, game magazines
1064000	1066000	That you look through and get new tips out of
1066000	1068000	And of course they have cheat codes
1068000	1070000	There's all these little throwbacks
1070000	1072000	To things we might remember from the 80s
1072000	1074000	Like really bad Engrish and some of the games
1074000	1076000	And all this stuff
1076000	1078000	Here's the only thing I didn't like about Retro Game Challenge
1078000	1080000	Is that everything was very sequential
1080000	1082000	Like when you buy the game, you have to start with a particular shooter game
1082000	1084000	Then move on to the racing game
1084000	1086000	Then move on
1086000	1088000	You know, and I kind of would have liked a little more openness
1088000	1090000	Even if it didn't
1090000	1092000	Give you everything at once
1092000	1094000	Maybe if you started with three of the games
1094000	1096000	And you could kind of go back and forth
1096000	1098000	And beat the challenges you wanted to in one
1098000	1100000	And then move on to another
1100000	1102000	I would have liked to see a little more freedom
1102000	1104000	In the way the actual game itself was set up
1104000	1106000	But it's not enough to really distract
1106000	1108000	From the fact that the game is really a throwback
1108000	1110000	To the old school days
1110000	1112000	So honestly
1112000	1114000	Excuse me, if you were a kid gaming in the 1980s
1114000	1116000	I think you'd get a kick out of this
1116000	1118000	And might want to check it out on the Nintendo DS
1118000	1120000	Sorry, yes
1120000	1122000	Start to see us as Zanac is the game
1122000	1124000	Not Xanax, that's a, I think, drug
1124000	1126000	Anyhow, also games
1126000	1128000	That I've been playing, Bit.Trip Beat
1128000	1130000	On the Nintendo Wii
1130000	1132000	Kind of interesting, it's like Pong meets Guitar Hero
1132000	1134000	Type thing, where as you move
1134000	1136000	The paddle up and down
1136000	1138000	Which you do by tilting the Wiimote
1138000	1140000	You can control
1140000	1142000	Chiptune type music
1142000	1144000	Everything's very scripted in the game
1144000	1146000	Which you don't understand really
1146000	1148000	With the trailers, it kind of looks like you're playing
1148000	1150000	A natural game of Pong or something
1150000	1152000	But everything is very, very scripted
1152000	1154000	In these very long stages
1154000	1156000	That go on for, I think, about 15 minutes
1156000	1158000	Playing these different songs
1158000	1160000	Now the only drawback is that there's only
1160000	1162000	Three stages, so there's only really three songs
1162000	1164000	But when you consider that 600
1164000	1166000	Wii points is what you'd pay for
1166000	1168000	Three rock band songs
1168000	1170000	I still think you kind of are getting your deal out of this game
1170000	1172000	I think it's a fun little game
1172000	1174000	You know, I don't think it's anything
1174000	1176000	You're going to play forever and ever
1176000	1178000	But for $6 it's not bad
1178000	1180000	I'd recommend the game
1180000	1182000	Bobby and I were talking about it a little bit at the end of his show
1182000	1184000	Because he's on just before us
1184000	1186000	Here on All Games Radio and I gave it a B or a B-
1186000	1188000	With him, so that's about where I'd put it
1188000	1190000	Other games I've been playing
1190000	1192000	This week
1192000	1194000	Final Fantasy Crystal Defenders
1194000	1196000	Which is very similar to a lot of those
1196000	1198000	Flash tower defender games you see online
1198000	1200000	Except now with Black Mages and Archers
1200000	1202000	Surprisingly a lot of fun
1202000	1204000	I did it on both of the iPhone and the Xbox 360
1204000	1206000	And I have to admit I like it a little more
1206000	1208000	On the Xbox 360 because of the fast forward button
1208000	1210000	And if the iPhone has one I haven't found it yet
1210000	1212000	I'm sure it's in there somewhere
1212000	1214000	But I just thought that was
1214000	1216000	It's just a fun little time waster and time distracter
1216000	1218000	But on the Xbox 360 you have to remember
1218000	1220000	It is a port of a cell phone game
1220000	1222000	So you're not going to have a lot of extravagant graphics
1222000	1224000	Or anything, but you know a good game doesn't necessarily
1224000	1226000	Need great graphics, for instance BitTripBeat
1226000	1228000	Has the graphics of an Atari 2600 game
1228000	1230000	But it's still kind of fun
1230000	1232000	And then also just a few things here and there
1232000	1234000	I checked out Hasbro Family Game Night
1234000	1236000	Briefly which is a little bit
1236000	1238000	You know it's a little deceptive
1238000	1240000	Well I don't know if I should say deceptive
1240000	1242000	But it's unlike other games
1242000	1244000	Because I thought you were going to get all these games
1244000	1246000	The Kinect 4, the Scrabble
1246000	1248000	And all this stuff for 10 bucks
1248000	1250000	No no, each of those games within Scrabble
1250000	1252000	Or within Family Game Night
1252000	1254000	Cost 10 bucks
1254000	1256000	Family Game Night is like the front end
1256000	1258000	So it's an interesting way to deliver the games
1258000	1260000	But I don't know, 10 dollars
1260000	1262000	A little high for games like Kinect 4
1262000	1264000	It might be worth it to play games like Scrabble
1264000	1266000	Online, but I don't know so much
1266000	1268000	About the others, so I guess it's kind
1268000	1270000	Of cool they let you pick and choose
1270000	1272000	The other interesting thing, here's what I don't understand
1272000	1274000	About Family Game Night
1274000	1276000	Is there's a lot of people
1276000	1278000	I'm watching Twitter and stuff and a lot of people
1278000	1280000	That are getting really into this and playing this
1280000	1282000	And trying to meet up with folks online
1282000	1284000	But these are the same people that would dismiss
1284000	1286000	A lot of the Wii games that are coming out recently
1286000	1288000	As shovelware
1288000	1290000	Well, Family Game Night was released on the Wii
1290000	1292000	And if you think about it, in some ways
1292000	1294000	It almost had a better value
1294000	1296000	Because I think there's 7 games in this thing
1296000	1298000	Which would cost you 70 dollars altogether
1298000	1300000	I think the Wii version had one less game
1300000	1302000	So it was like 60 dollars
1302000	1304000	But you were only paying like 40 for it
1304000	1306000	Now granted, you know
1306000	1308000	The Wii version doesn't have internet play
1308000	1310000	So it kind of depends how much that's worth to you
1310000	1312000	And all that, but it just kind of amuses me
1312000	1314000	That I think a lot of people forget
1314000	1316000	It's one big bundle on the Wii
1316000	1318000	Something to consider
1318000	1320000	If you're going to get all these games
1320000	1322000	Or if you think this is something that might be for you
1322000	1324000	Because you have a family
1324000	1326000	There's already a version out there on the Wii
1326000	1328000	That's probably going to be in the bargain bin before too long
1328000	1330000	That might suit you better
1330000	1332000	But of course, online play goes a long way
1332000	1334000	I get that
1334000	1336000	I checked out the demo for Uno Rush
1336000	1338000	I didn't like it at all
1338000	1340000	I didn't like the way the game runs at all
1340000	1342000	It's not the video game itself
1342000	1344000	It's not the way it was ported
1344000	1346000	I don't like the game itself
1346000	1348000	I don't like the whole organizing your cards
1348000	1350000	As the game goes on
1350000	1352000	And plus, I don't think it's worth the 5 extra dollars
1352000	1354000	That they want to charge for that
1354000	1356000	As opposed to the 5 dollars for regular Uno
1356000	1358000	Which seems to be a more accepted price point
1358000	1360000	And sadly one that we rarely see anymore
1360000	1362000	Yeah, Uno is so a few years ago
1362000	1364000	Some comments from chatroom
1364000	1366000	Leo Shen says
1366000	1368000	Hardcore Xbox Connect Fucking 4 is worth 10 dollars
1368000	1370000	Drop your piece, bitch
1370000	1372000	Sneaky there, you bitch
1372000	1374000	I guess that could be worth it
1374000	1376000	I don't know, I just think it would get a little old after a while
1376000	1378000	But then again, you know what
1378000	1380000	How can I say Uno is great
1380000	1382000	And then say these games are not great
1382000	1384000	The only difference really is 5 more dollars
1384000	1386000	And these games graphically are a little more polished
1386000	1388000	Than the ones in Family Game Night
1388000	1390000	I don't know
1390000	1392000	GameGuru says you might pick it up
1392000	1394000	When it's in the bargain bin
1394000	1396000	Perhaps
1396000	1398000	That's about it for my gaming week
1398000	1400000	I have a lot of little things here and there
1400000	1402000	But I didn't play a lot of games for a long, long time
1402000	1404000	That's the weird thing
1404000	1406000	Is that I played a lot of games here and there
1406000	1408000	Probably Retro Game Challenge is the one I played the most
1408000	1410000	Because I've unlocked like
1410000	1412000	Maybe 5 different games in Retro Game Challenge now
1412000	1414000	So there's a lot, a lot of
1414000	1416000	Stuff to do there
1416000	1418000	Alright, let's move on into some housekeeping
1418000	1420000	And then we'll get into the gaming news
1420000	1422000	Because there was a lot of news this week
1422000	1424000	And that's not even counting the week we were gone
1424000	1426000	I don't even think we're going to have time to address the week we were gone
1426000	1428000	From Game Developers Conference
1428000	1430000	Just some quick housekeeping
1430000	1432000	We don't have a lot of stuff to note right off the top
1432000	1434000	But we do want to remind you guys to join our Twitter
1434000	1436000	At OLR is our username on Twitter
1436000	1438000	So that's getting more and more popular
1438000	1440000	We got like randomly like 20 new followers all in one day
1440000	1442000	I don't know if somebody followed Friday to us
1442000	1444000	Is that what it is?
1444000	1446000	There was a lot of people
1446000	1448000	Because we didn't have
1448000	1450000	But maybe 150 to begin with
1450000	1452000	So I just thought it was pretty cool
1452000	1454000	So thanks to everybody who's now following us on Twitter
1454000	1456000	If you're not on there yet, you should add us
1456000	1458000	We ask questions and we're going to read replies a little later in the show
1458000	1460000	You don't even have to really be listening live
1460000	1462000	I'm going to get to tonight's question a little bit later
1462000	1464000	And also though, you don't just have Twitter
1464000	1466000	Because I know there's a lot of anti-Twitters out there
1466000	1468000	That's fine, whatever you're into
1468000	1470000	Facebook, OLR is our club on Facebook
1470000	1472000	We have a MySpace as well
1472000	1474000	Orange Lounge Radio
1474000	1476000	But is it just me or is MySpace like quickly dying off?
1476000	1478000	Like Facebook is really stomping them out
1478000	1480000	I hated MySpace from the first day I was on it
1480000	1482000	So the only reason I
1482000	1484000	Even remotely look at it anymore
1484000	1486000	Is because my brothers every so often are on there
1486000	1488000	There were things I liked about MySpace
1488000	1490000	But I'm slowly not liking it as much anymore
1490000	1492000	The only thing that I wish that Facebook would get
1492000	1494000	Is customizable backgrounds
1494000	1496000	And then
1496000	1498000	The other thing, LiveJournal
1498000	1500000	Is also our community at Orange Lounge
1500000	1502000	Which we haven't posted a lot too lately
1502000	1504000	Especially as our
1504000	1506000	Listeners and stuff post things there
1506000	1508000	We always read that and keep an eye on that
1508000	1510000	Okay
1510000	1512000	Also yeah, Dekeman reminds us
1512000	1514000	Hey there's that little box called extended play
1514000	1516000	On the OLR homepage and it has it all
1516000	1518000	It has like our last FM group, our steam community
1518000	1520000	If you want to find some like-minded gamers
1520000	1522000	That cool people to listen to
1522000	1524000	A little internet radio program out of someone's
1524000	1526000	Garage then check it out
1526000	1528000	On OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1528000	1530000	Alright let's get into some gaming news because damn
1530000	1532000	A lot happened this week and that might be thanks to
1532000	1534000	A little thing called the Game Developers Conference
1534000	1536000	Which might I remind you is not E3
1536000	1538000	It's not where the companies are supposed
1538000	1540000	To make their big, big announcements
1540000	1542000	But sometimes you'll hear things aimed
1542000	1544000	Towards developers and we have had big announcements
1544000	1546000	Out of GDC in the past, for instance
1546000	1548000	PlayStation Home was a big one we got a couple years ago
1548000	1550000	And sometimes you get some game announcements
1550000	1552000	Here and there, but we got quite a bit out of this year's
1552000	1554000	Game Developer Conference. Loki's gonna start us off tonight
1554000	1556000	Yes, there's a new
1556000	1558000	I'm not even sure if you'd call it a console
1558000	1560000	Format I guess, on Live
1560000	1562000	Which is gonna basically
1562000	1564000	Be almost like
1564000	1566000	I guess those TiVo boxes
1566000	1568000	That you can get where you can stream
1568000	1570000	Videos to your home
1570000	1572000	This service you'll actually be able to stream
1572000	1574000	Games to your home
1574000	1576000	And it'll also be like a really small
1576000	1578000	Box that you would put next to your TV
1578000	1580000	Have a USB controller
1580000	1582000	That would plug into it and basically you'll be able to stream
1582000	1584000	High end games, everything from
1584000	1586000	Crysis to Burnout, Paradise
1586000	1588000	Stuff like that
1588000	1590000	And they're saying that they
1590000	1592000	Can do it within the limits of bandwidth
1592000	1594000	Right now and that there's minor
1594000	1596000	No lag whatsoever
1596000	1598000	But the frame rate can take a hit
1598000	1600000	If your stream isn't that
1600000	1602000	Doesn't have that much bandwidth
1602000	1604000	So you see
1604000	1606000	When I was first reading about this I was thinking
1606000	1608000	It was gonna be like GameTap
1608000	1610000	But something you took up to your TV
1610000	1612000	And I think I remember saying a long time ago
1612000	1614000	And I don't even know if it was when we interviewed
1614000	1616000	The guy from GameTap, that was a long time ago
1616000	1618000	But I remember we were talking about GameTap should be something
1618000	1620000	You can plug into your TV and this thing would
1620000	1622000	Sell like crazy
1622000	1624000	This might as well be like an extension
1624000	1626000	Of GameTap or just rename it to GameTap
1626000	1628000	And just have like
1628000	1630000	Well the same people are involved so they can't really do that
1630000	1632000	Well damn just talk to
1632000	1634000	Hey okay you got the technology
1634000	1636000	You've got the technology, they've got the name
1636000	1638000	And you know, let's do it
1638000	1640000	Not only do we get the high end PC games
1640000	1642000	Let's get some you know the retro stuff
1642000	1644000	Just have everything
1644000	1646000	Okay but the streaming frame skipping is weird to me
1646000	1648000	Because the way GameTap works
1648000	1650000	You download the whole game to your computer
1650000	1652000	And then play it that way
1652000	1654000	It doesn't sound like this works the same way
1654000	1656000	This is being run on like a remote server
1656000	1658000	That you're actually playing
1658000	1660000	Which is pretty impressive when you think about it
1660000	1662000	Because there's like little
1662000	1664000	No lag whatsoever, at least no discernible lag
1664000	1666000	So that's kind of cool
1666000	1668000	Or so they say
1668000	1670000	I mean let's face it right
1670000	1672000	Obviously right now they have to probably test the hell out of it
1672000	1676000	Because I can't imagine that this is really going to work
1676000	1678000	I mean unless they have one hell of an algorithm
1678000	1680000	Basically it is
1680000	1682000	Because the way I see it
1682000	1684000	You're going to need a PC for every one of these
1684000	1686000	Things that are going
1686000	1688000	So each person is going to need their own PC
1688000	1690000	Basically in this remote server
1690000	1692000	To be able to play this stuff
1692000	1694000	Whatever game
1694000	1696000	So this does not hook up to your TV?
1696000	1698000	No, well it does hook up to your TV
1698000	1700000	But I mean
1700000	1702000	You don't need your own PC
1702000	1704000	Your own high end PC to run this stuff
1704000	1706000	Which I think you should
1706000	1708000	Actually be able to play these games
1708000	1710000	Is the effort that it takes to
1710000	1712000	Own a PC or build a PC to do it
1712000	1714000	But whatever
1714000	1716000	In your hacking and cracking opinion
1716000	1718000	Well not really
1718000	1720000	Because I'd be pissed off if my stream crisis
1720000	1722000	Got to the end and couldn't finish it
1722000	1724000	Because the game was broken
1724000	1726000	You hook this box into your TV
1726000	1728000	Correct? Yes
1728000	1730000	So you don't need a computer at all or a monitor
1730000	1732000	That's important
1732000	1734000	All you need to do is basically hook it up to
1734000	1736000	Well
1736000	1738000	On the back here it looks like they've got a phone jack
1738000	1740000	And they've also got
1740000	1742000	That might be a USB jack actually
1742000	1744000	Never mind
1744000	1746000	But they've got an ethernet and then your HDMI
1746000	1748000	That's going to plug into that
1748000	1750000	I don't know
1750000	1752000	It looks neat
1752000	1754000	Some of the other cool features on there
1754000	1756000	They're going to have a way you can share
1756000	1758000	Videos
1758000	1760000	They call them brag clips
1760000	1762000	No real gamer score obviously
1762000	1764000	You can rent the game
1764000	1766000	You can demo it before you buy it
1766000	1768000	Obviously
1768000	1770000	Lots of cool stuff
1770000	1772000	And I don't know
1772000	1774000	It's a neat idea if they can get it to work
1774000	1776000	That'd be really cool
1776000	1778000	The problem is I don't know if they're going to be able to get it to work
1778000	1780000	Like they want to
1780000	1782000	But I think there are other applications for it
1782000	1784000	If this doesn't end up working out
1784000	1786000	I'm very curious to see what's going to happen at E3
1786000	1788000	Because you know they're going to probably
1788000	1790000	Have to kind of show a little more
1790000	1792000	Stuff at E3 and there's going to be a much bigger audience
1792000	1794000	Of people watching them at E3
1794000	1796000	I'm kind of curious to see how it really
1796000	1798000	Flows
1798000	1800000	But my thing is
1800000	1802000	If they can get to work
1802000	1804000	With this little stupid box
1804000	1806000	And stream it
1806000	1808000	What's going to say stop
1808000	1810000	Sony or Microsoft from streaming a game
1810000	1812000	A full game
1812000	1814000	Over their service
1814000	1816000	Isn't this the direction we've all seen them moving in anyway?
1816000	1818000	Yeah
1818000	1820000	It's not any surprise
1820000	1822000	Microsoft and Sony have slowly been walking
1822000	1824000	This direction anyway
1824000	1826000	Especially now that Sony offers their old school catalog
1826000	1828000	As download titles to the
1828000	1830000	TV and the
1830000	1832000	PSP
1832000	1834000	And now you can buy Burnout Paradise online
1834000	1836000	Completely
1836000	1838000	But I think this would be even better though
1838000	1840000	Because for a console manufacturer
1840000	1842000	They've already got the console to crunch everything
1842000	1844000	It wouldn't necessarily be all
1844000	1846000	On a remote server
1846000	1848000	And sending all the information
1848000	1850000	And sending it your way
1850000	1852000	You can actually use some of the processing power
1852000	1854000	Of the console itself
1854000	1856000	To kind of take care of that
1856000	1858000	So it should be easier to do it on a console
1858000	1860000	Than say whatever this little box is
1860000	1862000	Because that's basically just receiving a signal
1862000	1864000	That means converting the video feed
1864000	1866000	I think it's just a matter of time
1866000	1868000	Before we start seeing the newest, latest
1868000	1870000	And greatest games or things that you download
1870000	1872000	You know and all this
1872000	1874000	I think it's just a matter of time
1874000	1876000	To get late in this generation
1876000	1878000	I think, but especially as we start getting into
1878000	1880000	The next Microsoft
1880000	1882000	The next PS4
1882000	1884000	Or whatever, I think we're really going to start seeing
1884000	1886000	These types of ideas that
1886000	1888000	Maybe OnLive is bringing to the table
1888000	1890000	Mixed with the
1890000	1892000	Console power
1892000	1894000	So, be interesting
1894000	1896000	Alright, well
1896000	1898000	Talking about other things
1898000	1900000	That came out of
1900000	1902000	Game Developers Conference
1902000	1904000	We're talking about digital rights management
1904000	1906000	And one of the big companies of course behind DRM
1906000	1908000	Is Steam
1908000	1910000	Steamworks is a new kind of thing
1910000	1912000	That Valve is putting together and they're talking about
1912000	1914000	How it's going to make DRM
1914000	1916000	Obsolete
1916000	1918000	Apparently Steamworks has this new anti-piracy
1918000	1920000	Technology that involves
1920000	1922000	Customer executable generation
1922000	1924000	Which they're calling SEG for short
1924000	1926000	C-E-G
1926000	1928000	Although which is funny because I have a friend named SEG
1928000	1930000	But it's spelled differently
1930000	1932000	SEG
1932000	1934000	It sounds like basically each individual
1934000	1936000	Gets their own unique executable file
1936000	1938000	But you can play it
1938000	1940000	On any compatible PC
1940000	1942000	No install limits
1942000	1944000	No rootkits
1944000	1946000	But when you buy the copy
1946000	1948000	It's your customized copy
1948000	1950000	So if suddenly your copy were to show up on a torrent
1950000	1952000	Everybody would know who did it
1952000	1954000	Interesting
1954000	1956000	Kind of surprised a technique like this
1956000	1958000	Hasn't been thought of a long time ago
1958000	1960000	Wouldn't the hackers figure out a way to take
1960000	1962000	The information out of the EXE
1962000	1964000	Or block it or scramble
1964000	1966000	Or figure out how to sign it themselves
1966000	1968000	It's not going to work
1968000	1970000	It's a good attempt but it's not going to work
1972000	1974000	Well you know where there's a will
1974000	1976000	There's a way
1976000	1978000	Pirates are going to hack everything
1978000	1980000	Did they say that this way
1980000	1982000	That it will end piracy
1982000	1984000	Basically?
1984000	1986000	I don't think anybody is going to make those bold statements anymore
1986000	1988000	Like DRM obsolete
1988000	1990000	That they did claim
1990000	1992000	Okay well maybe that's not so bad but
1992000	1994000	I don't know
1994000	1996000	I still think that
1996000	1998000	Even if they don't even care
1998000	2000000	About the subject matter being put out
2000000	2002000	I'm sorry
2002000	2004000	The hacking community likes a good challenge
2004000	2006000	Tigerclaw in our chat room
2006000	2008000	chat.orangelandrater.com says it's called a watermark
2008000	2010000	Which you know
2010000	2012000	You think like a picture
2012000	2014000	Sometimes if you have a picture on a website
2014000	2016000	Some websites do this crap all the time
2016000	2018000	Like for instance
2018000	2020000	A company like IGN
2020000	2022000	Might find a logo for a brand new Wii game
2022000	2024000	On some piddly little independent radio site
2024000	2026000	And copy it
2026000	2028000	And then they'll put their watermark on it
2028000	2030000	When they put it on their own website
2030000	2032000	So that everybody knows that when they get it
2032000	2034000	From the bigger website with all the bandwidth
2034000	2036000	That it came from IGN
2036000	2038000	Which may or may not be true
2038000	2040000	Is that a good analogy?
2040000	2042000	That's a pretty good analogy I think
2042000	2044000	This is actually speaking of the same situation
2044000	2046000	What we should be doing
2046000	2048000	Is going in photoshop and adding in
2048000	2050000	The image information
2050000	2052000	Details as far as what was taken
2052000	2054000	Where it came from that type of thing
2054000	2056000	Embed all that data within the file
2056000	2058000	Where you don't actually need the watermark
2058000	2060000	I'm actually thinking that
2060000	2062000	That could be something more like what they're going to do
2062000	2064000	Actually have something
2064000	2066000	Not necessarily
2066000	2068000	Overt like
2068000	2070000	A watermark like you're saying
2070000	2072000	But something that's embedded deep into the code
2072000	2074000	Or maybe even
2074000	2076000	Some little difference
2076000	2078000	In a code like a different color
2078000	2080000	On a shirt or something
2080000	2082000	For a particular character they know they look for that character
2082000	2084000	That shirt's a different color that's your copy
2084000	2086000	You know a series of
2086000	2088000	Randomly generated events
2088000	2090000	Though that will identify it
2090000	2092000	But not be immediately
2092000	2094000	Yeah I was going to say if they want to be smart about this
2094000	2096000	They're not going to put the information out there
2096000	2098000	In the open. The subtle watermark
2098000	2100000	Will be something like
2100000	2102000	A particular pattern that appears
2102000	2104000	Or a picture that shows up somewhere
2104000	2106000	That it's going to take a while for the
2106000	2108000	Pirates to figure out
2108000	2110000	What is being watermarked
2110000	2112000	I think if you just cram name and number in the file
2112000	2114000	That's not going to be enough
2114000	2116000	And if they're not doing it that way that idea
2116000	2118000	Is copyright
2118000	2120000	2009 Jamie
2120000	2122000	That's right
2122000	2124000	Put a little watermark on it right now
2124000	2126000	I'm saying right now that's my idea
2126000	2128000	That's a very interesting way around it though
2128000	2130000	So there you go
2130000	2132000	We'll see what happens with this
2132000	2134000	You know obviously steam has a lot of power
2134000	2136000	So far I suppose you could say
2136000	2138000	So it will be interesting to see
2138000	2140000	Kind of the impact that this ultimately has
2140000	2142000	On the PC gaming and the PC
2142000	2144000	Piracy scene
2144000	2146000	Well in other PC news
2146000	2148000	And piracy
2148000	2150000	God this is going to make it so easy for the pirates
2150000	2152000	But who cares
2152000	2154000	Sims 3 is not going to use the DRM
2154000	2156000	It's actually going to
2156000	2158000	Just use a key code
2158000	2160000	A CD key
2160000	2162000	That will be broken in about 5 seconds
2162000	2164000	I know
2164000	2166000	But then again
2166000	2168000	It's seriously with as many people
2168000	2170000	Complain about DRM
2170000	2172000	It's really going to be the best way
2172000	2174000	I think right now to at least
2174000	2176000	You know
2176000	2178000	Please some of the players
2178000	2180000	So
2180000	2182000	Although I love
2182000	2184000	Love what the guy said about it
2184000	2186000	There's a quote from
2188000	2190000	Trying to see
2190000	2192000	Who the person is
2192000	2194000	Rod Humble
2194000	2196000	Who is the executive producer
2196000	2198000	Saying
2198000	2200000	We feel that this is a good time proven solution
2200000	2202000	Which makes it easy for you to play the game without
2202000	2204000	DRM methods
2204000	2206000	That feel overly invasive or leave you concerned
2206000	2208000	About authorization server access
2208000	2210000	In the distant future
2210000	2212000	I agree to that
2212000	2214000	Extent you won't have to worry about
2214000	2216000	Being authorized every time you play it
2216000	2218000	You won't have to worry about
2218000	2220000	You know having to
2220000	2222000	Be online to play it but at the same
2222000	2224000	Time it is
2224000	2226000	Going to mean that they're going to find a lot
2226000	2228000	More
2228000	2230000	I suppose hacked versions out there
2230000	2232000	You know that people are going to be breaking
2232000	2234000	Those codes
2234000	2236000	That's good I didn't want to buy that game anyways
2236000	2238000	I'm buying it
2238000	2240000	I need to make more houses
2240000	2242000	I need to burn more people
2242000	2244000	I need to drown more people in the pool
2244000	2246000	And then turn the lawn into a graveyard
2246000	2248000	That's even better
2248000	2250000	And then the people who move in
2250000	2252000	Are like haunted
2252000	2254000	There needs to be more vampires in Sims 3
2254000	2256000	And aliens
2256000	2258000	And um
2258000	2260000	Mutant powers
2260000	2262000	So it'll be Sims X3
2262000	2264000	Okay
2264000	2266000	But not a crappy sequel
2266000	2268000	Dear god no
2268000	2270000	Anyways
2270000	2272000	There's some pretty interesting stuff
2272000	2274000	I mean we've already seen this with the
2274000	2276000	Xbox 360 but now Netflix
2276000	2278000	Is kind of branching out to other
2278000	2280000	Game systems to see
2280000	2282000	You know maybe there's
2282000	2284000	Potential interest in
2284000	2286000	Streaming to theirs
2286000	2288000	For example the Playstation 3
2288000	2290000	There was a survey going around
2290000	2292000	Asking people what their
2292000	2294000	If they'd be interested in something
2294000	2296000	Like the service that they have
2296000	2298000	Right now on the Xbox 360
2298000	2300000	On the Playstation 3
2300000	2302000	However it'd be a little bit different
2302000	2304000	What would happen is you'd actually have
2304000	2306000	To purchase a Netflix
2306000	2308000	Instant streaming disc for a one time fee
2308000	2310000	Of $10 and since this can be
2310000	2312000	Put into your
2312000	2314000	Drive and then basically install
2314000	2316000	The run off there and then you have to
2316000	2318000	Connect your PS3 to the internet
2318000	2320000	And you'd be able to stream
2320000	2322000	All sorts of stuff to it
2322000	2324000	All different movies
2324000	2326000	And could this perhaps
2326000	2328000	Mean that we're going to see Netflix
2328000	2330000	Coming to other systems?
2330000	2332000	Maybe? I don't know
2332000	2334000	I think they're going to go where the money is so
2334000	2336000	Why not?
2336000	2338000	Huh
2338000	2340000	It's just interesting though because I think
2340000	2342000	In our minds we all assume that Playstation 3
2342000	2344000	Will go with a competitor like Blockbuster
2344000	2346000	Or something else so it's kind of interesting
2346000	2348000	That Netflix could essentially end up
2348000	2350000	Having Monopoly pretty soon
2350000	2352000	On the high end systems
2352000	2354000	Yeah
2354000	2356000	Well it may not just be a monopoly with the high end systems
2356000	2358000	It may be a monopoly with the
2358000	2360000	New gen systems you know whatever you want to call
2360000	2362000	The Wii as well and that is that
2362000	2364000	There's a survey going around
2364000	2366000	Apparently hinting that there could be a Netflix
2366000	2368000	Service for the Wii in the future
2368000	2370000	Apparently this is
2370000	2372000	Some type of survey
2372000	2374000	Going around that's asking
2374000	2376000	If they would be
2376000	2378000	Interested in a Netflix
2378000	2380000	Sorry Netflix instant
2380000	2382000	Streaming disc
2382000	2384000	Apparently this would be a disc that you would
2384000	2386000	Put in the Wii when you want to use the Netflix
2386000	2388000	Streaming service and it's
2388000	2390000	Not something that would come automatically with a firmware
2390000	2392000	Update so I'm not sure if you have to buy this for a fee
2392000	2394000	Or if it would be very low cost or something you could order
2394000	2396000	From Netflix no idea
2396000	2398000	Very
2398000	2400000	Interesting to see if this would actually
2400000	2402000	Be something that would happen
2402000	2404000	Oh no I'm sorry I'm looking at
2404000	2406000	It in the survey it says a one time fee
2406000	2408000	Of ten dollars for the Netflix instant
2408000	2410000	Streaming disc and then your Wii would be connected to the
2410000	2412000	Internet
2412000	2414000	So it could be that Netflix
2414000	2416000	Could automatically show up on the Wii the
2416000	2418000	PS3 and the Xbox 360
2418000	2420000	All at once and they would kind of dominate the streaming
2420000	2422000	Video market I don't know if this would
2422000	2424000	Necessarily be a bad thing I mean you know
2424000	2426000	Netflix has a pretty big library but of course little
2426000	2428000	Competitions healthy too one thing
2428000	2430000	I think Netflix suffers from is they don't have
2430000	2432000	A lot of big big stuff in
2432000	2434000	Their streaming library and I know they've talked about
2434000	2436000	Adding stuff later on for a higher fee but
2436000	2438000	They don't get a lot of brand
2438000	2440000	New stuff if it's not an obscure
2440000	2442000	Indie film or a
2442000	2444000	Documentary which don't get me wrong those aren't necessarily
2444000	2446000	Bad but some days you want to
2446000	2448000	Watch the big action shoot them up too and those things are
2448000	2450000	Never available instantly right away for
2450000	2452000	Many many many years so
2452000	2454000	I don't know I think
2454000	2456000	A little competition would be healthy if one of the other services
2456000	2458000	Would get involved at the same time if Netflix
2458000	2460000	Hopefully can get some of the newer stuff on
2460000	2462000	Their service it could be pretty awesome so
2462000	2464000	We'll see
2464000	2466000	We'll see if this uh
2466000	2468000	Survey of course surveys can sometimes be meaningless
2468000	2470000	It's just a survey don't take it too seriously
2470000	2472000	And the survey says
2472000	2474000	Who knows
2474000	2476000	Well how about something a little different
2476000	2478000	Sure
2478000	2480000	More stuff out of game developers conference
2480000	2482000	Yay
2482000	2484000	The legend of Zelda
2484000	2486000	Spirit tracks
2486000	2488000	It's sort of the makes me think of ice cream
2488000	2490000	You know what's
2490000	2492000	The one moose tracks
2492000	2494000	Is that I don't know
2494000	2496000	I want ice cream I think
2496000	2498000	Ice cream sounds delicious
2498000	2500000	I have one ice cream cone in the house
2500000	2502000	And I'm so eating it during break
2502000	2504000	You bitch don't hate me
2504000	2506000	Okay only if you buy me pie
2506000	2508000	We'll see
2508000	2510000	Anywhere
2510000	2512000	Anywhere
2512000	2514000	Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks is
2514000	2516000	Another cell
2516000	2518000	Shaded link game
2518000	2520000	But um
2520000	2522000	He's
2522000	2524000	Got a train
2524000	2526000	I guess with a cannon
2526000	2528000	I have no idea
2528000	2530000	I'm looking at some of this and it's just weird
2530000	2532000	But it looks like it's gonna be
2532000	2534000	On the Nintendo DS
2534000	2536000	Is it supposed to be some
2536000	2538000	Type of like training
2538000	2540000	Game or what is this
2540000	2542000	He's got a freaking train
2542000	2544000	Haven't they called this a rail shooter game or something?
2544000	2546000	Is what this is supposed to be
2546000	2548000	Link on a train
2548000	2550000	Seriously
2550000	2552000	It's just gonna be a standard Zelda game
2552000	2554000	It's just people are basing their
2554000	2556000	Information off of what they see in the trailer
2556000	2558000	And speculating
2558000	2560000	Okay now there's no water
2560000	2562000	But he's wearing a conductor's outfit in every darn scene you see him in
2562000	2564000	Maybe he likes it
2564000	2566000	Maybe it makes him feel sexy inside
2566000	2568000	I don't know
2568000	2570000	Maybe he's worn out the
2570000	2572000	Link on a train
2572000	2574000	I think Frisbee in chat sums it up
2574000	2576000	There's a song that would describe this game
2576000	2578000	Come on ride the train
2578000	2580000	And ride it woo woo
2580000	2582000	That should be the song they use in the trailer
2582000	2584000	I was thinking of Snakes on a Plane
2584000	2586000	Or Snakes on a Train
2586000	2588000	Wasn't that a direct to DVD version or something like that?
2588000	2590000	It was a knock off video
2590000	2592000	Alright well
2592000	2594000	I don't know
2594000	2596000	I guess more to come on this
2596000	2598000	Probably at E3
2598000	2600000	I'm assuming this is gonna be playable at E3
2600000	2602000	We'll find out more about this
2602000	2604000	When they're hurting there's a new Zelda game right?
2604000	2606000	I don't know
2606000	2608000	Yeah so
2608000	2610000	Along with that of course we have
2610000	2612000	A little bit more Zelda
2612000	2614000	Information including another
2614000	2616000	Zelda coming to Virtual Console
2616000	2618000	In Japan but you know
2618000	2620000	It's gonna be coming everywhere else eventually I'm sure
2620000	2622000	Actually
2622000	2624000	In April we're gonna be getting
2624000	2626000	Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask
2626000	2628000	On Virtual Console
2628000	2630000	Also expected out on
2630000	2632000	Sega Master System Phantasy Star
2632000	2634000	For the PC Engine
2634000	2636000	Ninja Gaiden
2636000	2638000	Also
2638000	2640000	Part of the Virtual Console Arcade
2640000	2642000	Genpai
2642000	2644000	Terma Den and Space Invaders
2644000	2646000	And then
2646000	2648000	For the Super Famicom Kirby's Dream Land 3
2648000	2650000	And
2650000	2652000	Let's see here
2652000	2654000	And then Castlevania 3
2654000	2656000	On the Famicom
2656000	2658000	So that's kinda cool
2658000	2660000	But I'm sure we'll see stuff
2660000	2662000	In other regions probably around the same time
2662000	2664000	I do want to point out though Phantasy Star is in that Ultimate Genesis Collection
2664000	2666000	You can get all of them
2666000	2668000	For like 30 bucks and you know
2668000	2670000	I would never pay 5 dollars
2670000	2672000	For just Phantasy Star when I know this is out there
2672000	2674000	With all the Phantasy Star games
2674000	2676000	For like 30 bucks
2676000	2678000	Just saying
2678000	2680000	Well their prices are a little high anyways
2680000	2682000	If you ask me
2682000	2684000	Anyhow
2684000	2686000	Look one thing that always kinda pissed me off
2686000	2688000	About Virtual Consoles is that there was no place on the damn Wii
2688000	2690000	To store all of these Virtual Console games
2690000	2692000	That sometimes I want to download
2692000	2694000	And especially add WiiWare into it
2694000	2696000	And the storage capacity on the Wii stinks
2696000	2698000	And you might remember people have been bitching about this
2698000	2700000	For a long time and what was it last like
2700000	2702000	Freaking September or October
2702000	2704000	This guy that worked for Nintendo came out and said
2704000	2706000	Nobody cares about that
2706000	2708000	Just geeks know Taku
2708000	2710000	Are the only people that care about this and I said F you buddy
2710000	2712000	May I?
2712000	2714000	Yeah exactly I said F you buddy
2714000	2716000	If that's gonna be your attitude then I
2716000	2718000	Ban myself from Virtual Console
2718000	2720000	I'm not downloading any more stuff
2720000	2722000	Cause I'll tell you what I had like 3 screens full of Virtual Console
2722000	2724000	Crap before that point I don't know how I fit it all in there
2724000	2726000	Mostly little NES games
2726000	2728000	I said you know the hell with this
2728000	2730000	If that's gonna be your attitude then I ban
2730000	2732000	Virtual Console until Nintendo addresses
2732000	2734000	This issue and guess what?
2734000	2736000	Finally
2736000	2738000	All these months later
2738000	2740000	Yes my boycott has come to an end
2740000	2742000	Because they did announce at Game Developers Conference
2742000	2744000	In 2009 that the Wii Shop channel
2744000	2746000	Would be updated with the SD Card
2746000	2748000	Menu that would allow you 20 pages
2748000	2750000	Of games on the
2750000	2752000	SD Card without having to
2752000	2754000	Copy it back and forth like you did
2754000	2756000	Before you could actually boot the damn game
2756000	2758000	From the SD Card and now
2758000	2760000	Not necessarily though
2760000	2762000	Also let me say this not just
2762000	2764000	Can you do 2GB
2764000	2766000	SD Cards which is a lot of room to begin with
2766000	2768000	Especially compared to what's on the Wii to begin with
2768000	2770000	You can now run up to 32GB
2770000	2772000	SD Cards in the slot
2772000	2774000	Loki what were you gonna say?
2774000	2776000	Technically it's not necessarily running off the
2776000	2778000	SD Card it's copying them to the Wii
2778000	2780000	Memory so that is one little
2780000	2782000	Asterisk on there you need to have
2782000	2784000	Free memory on your Wii's
2784000	2786000	Internal storage
2786000	2788000	However though if you get an SD Card
2788000	2790000	That's big enough just copy everything to the damn
2790000	2792000	SD Card at least all the games
2792000	2794000	You know save files I'm sure it'll be enough
2794000	2796000	But it alleviates the problem of having to go
2796000	2798000	Into the memory manager every single time
2798000	2800000	Which was stupid and I know a lot of people were
2800000	2802000	Emailing me saying Rob you should just copy things in the memory
2802000	2804000	I said no no that's stupid because it needs to be
2804000	2806000	Part of this whole seamless thing you know
2806000	2808000	You're making excuses for Nintendo
2808000	2810000	Having these big ideas
2810000	2812000	With what they want to do with the download service
2812000	2814000	And then not having the space to put it all
2814000	2816000	So you're making excuses so
2816000	2818000	Nintendo needs to address this directly make it very
2818000	2820000	Seamless make it easy and they
2820000	2822000	Finally did so there you go
2822000	2824000	And so of course if you were listening early in the show I talked about
2824000	2826000	I played Bit.Trip Beat I also played
2826000	2828000	Gradius Rebirth I didn't play it enough
2828000	2830000	I went on a buying binge to buy
2830000	2832000	Some of the things I missed out on
2832000	2834000	While my boycott was going on so
2834000	2836000	There you go
2836000	2838000	That happens from time to time sorry
2838000	2840000	What is this
2840000	2842000	Did you talk about your video right?
2842000	2844000	Yeah sometimes when you punch somebody they bounce
2844000	2846000	Back and they knock you open into the air
2846000	2848000	Anyways sorry back to the show
2848000	2850000	And Dr. Tutti in chat says as long as you leave enough
2850000	2852000	To load your biggest VC game should be an issue
2852000	2854000	You're right but all I do I copy all
2854000	2856000	My games to the SD card now and I'll have
2856000	2858000	Plenty of room on the
2858000	2860000	Wii I would like to point
2860000	2862000	Out and this is not unfortunately
2862000	2864000	A positive point for
2864000	2866000	Nintendo they've already figured out
2866000	2868000	How to crack this already
2868000	2870000	And now of course you can
2870000	2872000	Still load you know the 4.0
2872000	2874000	Firmware for your Wii
2874000	2876000	And still be able to install mods that
2876000	2878000	Are pirated and stuff and copy them all to your
2878000	2880000	SD cards and that sort of thing
2880000	2882000	But it does alleviate you know
2882000	2884000	Room so people can actually download more
2884000	2886000	Of your Wiiware stuff
2886000	2888000	Hmm
2888000	2890000	Alright well let's go to Twitter
2890000	2892000	And we do a little segment here on the show called
2892000	2894000	Show us your tweets and
2894000	2896000	We like to ask questions on Twitter and then you guys
2896000	2898000	Answer them and we read some of our favorite responses
2898000	2900000	Here on the show and we actually
2900000	2902000	Asked you guys just a little bit before the show started
2902000	2904000	Tonight we wanted to know
2904000	2906000	How you kind of felt about these Nintendo announcements
2906000	2908000	At GDC
2908000	2910000	We specifically asked did Nintendo's announcements
2910000	2912000	At GDC show a commitment
2912000	2914000	To us core gamers
2914000	2916000	Or are you not satisfied? Here's some of the answers we got
2916000	2918000	On Twitter which is a little
2918000	2920000	Bit diverse here
2920000	2922000	Let's see
2922000	2924000	We've got
2924000	2926000	Poor Leno111
2926000	2928000	Says to me the train plus Zelda equals
2928000	2930000	Fail I wish they would just go back to the old school
2930000	2932000	Style of Zelda
2932000	2934000	Ryan Belknap says
2934000	2936000	Just should be happy they said anything at all
2936000	2938000	They could have kept it for E3
2938000	2940000	Joy says with the new games and support
2940000	2942000	For a bigger SD card I think it's a great move
2942000	2944000	But I know tons of people will still complain
2944000	2946000	Scruffy K says no I think Nintendo
2946000	2948000	Is trying to keep the core gamers from deserting them
2948000	2950000	A Zelda in the hands is good as two
2950000	2952000	In production
2952000	2954000	Act Def says while nobody expected
2954000	2956000	Those announcements by Nintendo's part
2956000	2958000	I'm still waiting for a real core gamer
2958000	2960000	Announcement for E3 or I hope so
2960000	2962000	Crows said
2962000	2964000	Nintendo will never satisfy me until they
2964000	2966000	Make a new Star Fox game that is not full of suck
2966000	2968000	Deep Man says besides the
2968000	2970000	SD card thing I don't think I saw anything that
2970000	2972000	Impressed me from Nintendo this week
2972000	2974000	There you go
2974000	2976000	Some of the answers from our
2976000	2978000	Show us your tweets segment
2978000	2980000	We're on twitter.com under OLR
2980000	2982000	And we like to post questions for you guys to answer
2982000	2984000	Before the show
2984000	2986000	Let's move on we do have a couple more
2986000	2988000	Nintendo stories out of
2988000	2990000	Game developers conference I almost said
2990000	2992000	E3
2992000	2994000	We're a little bit
2994000	2996000	Stuck right now though so why don't I go ahead and just
2996000	2998000	Take this next one
2998000	3000000	So the next story would be about
3000000	3002000	Sorry we got some live issues going on
3002000	3004000	Live radio folks
3004000	3006000	It's called Jamie's computer is a piece of crap
3006000	3008000	That's alright well Jamie would have been excited to tell you
3008000	3010000	About the virtual console arcade that was
3010000	3012000	Also announced at game developers conference
3012000	3014000	And is now just
3014000	3016000	Loading?
3016000	3018000	Well then tell them what arcade games they can be looking forward to
3018000	3020000	Well hey there's all kinds of cool
3020000	3022000	Stuff that you can be looking forward to
3022000	3024000	In fact I would
3024000	3026000	Actually even say if you are a Namco
3026000	3028000	Fan then you're going to
3028000	3030000	Be supremely pleased
3030000	3032000	Now something that people should know
3032000	3034000	This is like now it's kind of
3034000	3036000	Like in a way they're adding a new system
3036000	3038000	To the virtual console
3038000	3040000	But that system is arcade games
3040000	3042000	Name for the Wii basically
3042000	3044000	There's actually four games that are available
3044000	3046000	Now there's
3046000	3048000	Gapless which is Namco Bondi
3048000	3050000	For 600 Wii points
3050000	3052000	Mappy we love Mappy
3052000	3054000	Annoying little freaking game that is
3054000	3056000	It's alright
3056000	3058000	500 Wii points there's
3058000	3060000	Tower of Druago which is
3060000	3062000	500 Wii points also available now
3062000	3064000	Star Force from Tecmo
3064000	3066000	500 points and then
3066000	3068000	We have a Sega game coming out
3068000	3070000	Which is my number three favorite game
3070000	3072000	Evar
3072000	3074000	Space Harrier
3074000	3076000	Hi
3076000	3078000	And then
3078000	3080000	From Namco Bondi
3080000	3082000	Again though
3082000	3084000	I'm a little torn because
3084000	3086000	Didn't a lot of these Namco games show up
3086000	3088000	In these various Namco collections they
3088000	3090000	Seem to put out on every system?
3090000	3092000	Some have not
3092000	3094000	And also other ones that are listed on here
3094000	3096000	Where we
3096000	3098000	Not seeing any too much else
3098000	3100000	Listed in the announcement list
3100000	3102000	Was Emeralda
3102000	3104000	There's also
3104000	3106000	The Return of Ishtar
3106000	3108000	So hey
3108000	3110000	Here's the mistake I don't want to make
3110000	3112000	It's very similar to the Sonic Genesis collection
3112000	3114000	I'm pretty sure I heard something about
3114000	3116000	Namco's putting out some type of new compilation
3116000	3118000	On the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
3118000	3120000	There's a new thing coming out for that
3120000	3122000	So if that is going to have Mappy
3122000	3124000	And some of these games in it
3124000	3126000	When that collection is going to be
3126000	3128000	$30 maybe $40 tops
3128000	3130000	Why would I buy one game
3130000	3132000	For 500 points when this is likely to
3132000	3134000	And again I don't know a lot about it
3134000	3136000	There's one being developed
3136000	3138000	Why would I do that?
3138000	3140000	Why wouldn't I just go buy the PS3 one
3140000	3142000	Just like I would say go buy the Sonic Genesis collection
3142000	3144000	I would actually buy
3144000	3146000	Individual games on here
3146000	3148000	Because I don't know if you remember this is an old example
3148000	3150000	You remember when I was scrambling
3150000	3152000	Like a chicken with a head cut off
3152000	3154000	To try to find the entire Namco
3154000	3156000	Playstation series
3156000	3158000	And I think I'm like
3158000	3160000	Missing the O
3160000	3162000	So I have some of the rare ones
3162000	3164000	For the trademark symbol that was only on Japan
3164000	3166000	Or the restricted symbol or whatever
3166000	3168000	But there's games on those compilations
3168000	3170000	That I wanted that we didn't get on the
3170000	3172000	US versions you know
3172000	3174000	And it would be far cheaper for me
3174000	3176000	To have my compilation and then
3176000	3178000	Just get the couple of them that I don't have
3178000	3180000	You know so like
3180000	3182000	For Tower of Druaga you know
3182000	3184000	True I have that on the Playstation
3184000	3186000	One but
3186000	3188000	It's not always convenient to hook up
3188000	3190000	You know my Playstation
3190000	3192000	Or deal with you know backwards compatibility
3192000	3194000	Or any of that
3194000	3196000	I can see that I can see that and you know like something like
3196000	3198000	A Space Harrier as much as you love that game
3198000	3200000	I can see why you would want to get that
3200000	3202000	And you know I'd have 50,000
3202000	3204000	I seriously can name off
3204000	3206000	Multiple versions of Space Harrier that I have
3206000	3208000	And what's one more right what's one more
3208000	3210000	Like I've got it on Saturn
3210000	3212000	I have it on PC Engine
3212000	3214000	I've got it on 32X
3214000	3216000	Ok it's only a 3 hour show
3216000	3218000	The 32X version is arcade perfect by the way
3218000	3220000	Insert coin instead of press start
3220000	3222000	Nice
3222000	3224000	But I was going to say you know and I think one thing
3224000	3226000	That I don't believe made our show roll tonight is about
3226000	3228000	The Final Fantasy games
3228000	3230000	All the old ones are going to be
3230000	3232000	They were officially announced that they're coming to Virtual Console
3232000	3234000	I'll pay the money for Final Fantasy 4 and 6 again
3234000	3236000	Even though I already own those games
3236000	3238000	I own 6 the cartridge
3238000	3240000	Somewhere and I own 4
3240000	3242000	Final Fantasy 5
3242000	3244000	I got 4 on the Wonderswan Color
3244000	3246000	Of all things I've got 4 on
3246000	3248000	You know the DS
3248000	3250000	I've got 4 you know
3250000	3252000	I'll buy it again on Super Nintendo that's how much I fucking love that game
3252000	3254000	Especially
3254000	3256000	Especially if they release
3256000	3258000	Although I have a feeling we're going to get the Bastard Eyes 2
3258000	3260000	That was the first release here because it is Virtual Console
3260000	3262000	But especially if we got like the Japanese retranslation
3262000	3264000	Oh my god I'd be so excited
3264000	3266000	I'd be so excited
3266000	3268000	If I had a perfect translation of Final Fantasy 3
3268000	3270000	I would be freaking in heaven
3270000	3272000	But you know what game that I totally wish
3272000	3274000	That they would bring out
3274000	3276000	That would be translated as Seiken Densetsu 3
3276000	3278000	Oh
3278000	3280000	Hi people there is an officially
3280000	3282000	There's a fully
3282000	3284000	Sprite hacked everything
3284000	3286000	Translated version out there just say
3286000	3288000	Let us use that please
3288000	3290000	Or just fucking use it because it was your game in the first place
3290000	3292000	You know what I mean
3292000	3294000	I think they would have every right to just use it
3294000	3296000	You know what I mean
3296000	3298000	What could the translators do
3298000	3300000	Gee sorry we you know kind of like
3300000	3302000	Copied your game and ROM dumped it
3302000	3304000	In the entirety of the internet right
3304000	3306000	That would totally not get
3306000	3308000	Nintendo any friends
3308000	3310000	But still
3310000	3312000	But still my point is
3312000	3314000	There that it exists
3314000	3316000	People did this in their spare time
3316000	3318000	Why can't Nintendo pay someone and just
3318000	3320000	Crank it out you know
3320000	3322000	Pay them a dollar
3322000	3324000	I don't think we'll see that ever
3324000	3326000	You know on a
3326000	3328000	Well we may eventually see it but
3328000	3330000	Never say never we did get Final Fantasy 5
3330000	3332000	Eventually
3332000	3334000	That's true
3334000	3336000	Eventually
3336000	3338000	Never say never with Second Detsetsu
3338000	3340000	Never say never
3340000	3342000	And that could be a thing that they would
3342000	3344000	Be holding back for E3 but you know
3344000	3346000	I don't want to get anyone's hopes up
3346000	3348000	And I doubt it but you know
3348000	3350000	You never know
3350000	3352000	That and Earthbound are like the two
3352000	3354000	Things they could pull out of their pants
3354000	3356000	And lay on the table and they would just like
3356000	3358000	Oh my god Fandagasm
3358000	3360000	Seriously it would be so much wank
3360000	3362000	For real
3362000	3364000	Speaking of so much wank
3364000	3366000	Oh
3366000	3368000	There's another game that will not be coming
3368000	3370000	To a Nintendo console soon
3370000	3372000	At least not through legitimate means
3372000	3374000	But now thanks to a
3374000	3376000	Coding competition there is
3376000	3378000	A new application Kamasutra
3378000	3380000	For the DS
3380000	3382000	Yes with this you can actually see
3382000	3384000	Visual representations of all the different
3384000	3386000	Kamasutra positions
3386000	3388000	And can learn about the pros and cons
3388000	3390000	Of them
3390000	3392000	No they'll release it in the states they'll just call it sex training
3392000	3394000	Yes my personal trainer
3394000	3396000	Kamasutra
3396000	3398000	They'll just rename it yoga for adults
3398000	3400000	My personal trainer butt sex
3400000	3402000	Wait is the gay Kamasutra
3402000	3404000	Part of this?
3404000	3406000	I don't know
3406000	3408000	I had it downloaded I just haven't gotten a chance to load it on my
3408000	3410000	Card yet
3410000	3412000	There's actually some other neat things that came out
3412000	3414000	But I can't remember what they were
3414000	3416000	Um
3416000	3418000	Robert M in chat is kind of referencing our
3418000	3420000	Last little bit there we were talking about Earthbound
3420000	3422000	And how it would just become fanboy wank all over the place
3422000	3424000	If that was announced for E3 and Robert M says
3424000	3426000	Didn't Black Wolf say Earthbound would not be
3426000	3428000	Coming to Virtual Console due to the pop
3428000	3430000	Culture references? True and Bobby
3430000	3432000	Did make a very good point and I'm not gonna
3432000	3434000	You know deny that there's a lot of shit they got
3434000	3436000	Away with 15 years ago they probably couldn't get away
3436000	3438000	With now especially with Wii getting sued as much as it does
3438000	3440000	However if they
3440000	3442000	Wanted to take the time to go back and recode
3442000	3444000	Some things and redo some things which you know
3444000	3446000	Wouldn't be that much time at all considering
3446000	3448000	How much this would sell
3448000	3450000	And then just kind of not tell people that
3450000	3452000	When they announce Earthbound that they oh yeah
3452000	3454000	And we changed it a lot
3454000	3456000	They'll still be wank all over the place
3456000	3458000	They did the same thing with
3458000	3460000	Tecmo Bowl, Wave Race 64
3460000	3462000	Yeah I mean it's not unheard of for them to change
3462000	3464000	Games
3464000	3466000	Granted there'd be a lot to change
3466000	3468000	But they could do it and probably make a killing
3468000	3470000	On Virtual Console they just wouldn't advertise
3470000	3472000	That they went back and changed stuff cause all the purists
3472000	3474000	Would be up in arms but it's
3474000	3476000	Better than nothing right?
3476000	3478000	The purists would be up in arms
3478000	3480000	Anyway and you know what to hell with it
3480000	3482000	As long as we get it
3482000	3484000	It depends how much they mess with it
3484000	3486000	For me but we'll see
3486000	3488000	More stuff out of Game Developer Conference
3488000	3490000	And this is also from Nintendo
3490000	3492000	A game called Rock and Roll Climber
3492000	3494000	Yeah Rock and Roll Climber
3494000	3496000	Not to be confused with Crazy Climber
3496000	3498000	That's a much different game
3498000	3500000	Ice Climber or Rock and Roll Racing
3500000	3502000	Although maybe you could unlock
3502000	3504000	Ice Climber in this game
3504000	3506000	What are you talking about?
3506000	3508000	What you talking about Loki?
3508000	3510000	What about Rock and Roll Racing or Snake and Roll
3510000	3512000	No this is a whole new game
3512000	3514000	Whole new IP so props to them for doing a new
3514000	3516000	IP but it's called Rock and Roll
3516000	3518000	Climber it's a balance board game
3518000	3520000	That you use the balance board and
3520000	3522000	The Wiimote and Nunchuck and you do
3522000	3524000	These arm movements to climb up a wall
3524000	3526000	The balance board reads your leg movements
3526000	3528000	The Wiimote and Nunchuck read your
3528000	3530000	Arm movements and
3530000	3532000	Apparently here's the weird thing
3532000	3534000	Once you get to the top you get a guitar
3534000	3536000	And you play a riff
3536000	3538000	So I'm assuming
3538000	3540000	There's some type of music
3540000	3542000	Fusion with this game I know they didn't say
3542000	3544000	A lot at GDC maybe this is one of the things
3544000	3546000	They're going to be showing more at E3 but I imagine
3546000	3548000	They're incorporating I mean to call the game Rock and Roll
3548000	3550000	Climber they're probably incorporating
3550000	3552000	Music into this now maybe it's that you have to climb
3552000	3554000	On beat or something like that I don't know it could be
3554000	3556000	Anything but I'm sure we'll see more of this
3556000	3558000	You have to wail hard
3558000	3560000	Just flail about aimlessly
3560000	3562000	I'm sure there's some type of rhythm
3562000	3564000	I'm still waiting for Air Guitar Hero
3564000	3566000	We just don't know
3566000	3568000	They have an air guitar mode in Guitar Hero
3568000	3570000	It's actually an air guitar machine
3570000	3572000	It just takes away the instruments
3572000	3574000	That they have
3574000	3576000	Anyhow there you go Rock and Roll Climber
3576000	3578000	Coming out probably
3578000	3580000	This summer or something
3580000	3582000	I may add it looked like crap
3582000	3584000	Also and it's a WiiWare title
3584000	3586000	And it looked like oh I didn't even
3586000	3588000	Catch that it's WiiWare? It's WiiWare
3588000	3590000	It's absolute crap
3590000	3592000	And everyone's like
3592000	3594000	Oh maybe it's the sequel to Ice Climber
3594000	3596000	No they would never do anything that cool
3596000	3598000	Because then if
3598000	3600000	They just kicked that guy in the face
3600000	3602000	Dark Tetsuya
3602000	3604000	You make horrible radio when you reference it
3604000	3606000	Dark Tetsuya says Sky the game kind of gives me a vibe
3606000	3608000	Of the old school NES version where it's just
3608000	3610000	Cute congrats on beating the level animation
3610000	3612000	Well maybe
3612000	3614000	That's basically it it's just another way to say
3614000	3616000	Look it's another thing you can use the Wii Fit board for
3616000	3618000	You can be fit and climb walls
3618000	3620000	Because people like climbing walls
3620000	3622000	The whole guitar thing sort of
3622000	3624000	Really makes me go back to a
3624000	3626000	Strong bad
3626000	3628000	Thing with the cheat
3628000	3630000	Here the tort have a trophy
3630000	3632000	I'm sorry I only want to climb walls
3632000	3634000	If I'm going to be chased by an American Gladiator
3634000	3636000	While I do so
3636000	3638000	There should be Frank mode where you can climb a
3638000	3640000	Button and then it falls on you and you die
3642000	3644000	And if you catch that reference you're awesome
3644000	3646000	I caught that reference and I don't even know
3646000	3648000	What it's from
3648000	3650000	Well I do know what it's from but I've never even seen the source material
3650000	3652000	Alright forget it
3652000	3654000	Let's move on
3654000	3656000	How about something crazy
3656000	3658000	And something that we already have in America
3658000	3660000	But hey our friends in the UK are finally getting it
3660000	3662000	You get Dementium
3662000	3664000	Where you can be Looney
3664000	3666000	Looney
3666000	3668000	Dementium the ward
3668000	3670000	It's for the DS
3670000	3672000	It will be out on April 17th
3672000	3674000	Two days before my birthday
3674000	3676000	But yeah we've had it since October
3676000	3678000	And it's been in Japan
3678000	3680000	Since summer
3680000	3682000	But if you want to be in a
3682000	3684000	Survival horror game
3684000	3686000	Where you can fight spooky
3686000	3688000	Monsters in a
3688000	3690000	Mental hospital
3690000	3692000	And not know how you got there
3692000	3694000	Get this game
3694000	3696000	How's that?
3696000	3698000	Wow that's a great sales pitch
3698000	3700000	Thank you
3700000	3702000	You get to be chased by monsters in the hospital
3702000	3704000	And it's not Silent Hill
3704000	3706000	I'm sure the makers of that game really appreciate you
3706000	3708000	For that little summary there
3708000	3710000	They're not even around anymore
3710000	3712000	Well they are around but they're not even Gamecock anymore
3712000	3714000	It's South Peak now
3714000	3716000	Not quite as cool
3716000	3718000	Didn't they get absorbed as part of the economy?
3718000	3726000	Gamecock has been inserted into another company
3726000	3728000	You're so mature
3728000	3732000	As we hinted earlier that the possible outcome of my console
3732000	3734000	I may remind you Rob
3734000	3736000	This console has died once
3736000	3738000	And come back to life
3738000	3740000	It's the Jesus console
3740000	3742000	Did it take you three days to revive it?
3742000	3744000	Yes it did actually
3744000	3746000	But
3746000	3748000	There is some striking
3748000	3750000	Infrural
3750000	3752000	I guess
3752000	3754000	Questionnaires that have been filled out
3754000	3756000	And people's input put in place
3756000	3758000	Both Joystick and Engadget
3758000	3760000	Have run polls regarding the E74 error
3760000	3762000	Which is
3762000	3764000	As Microsoft puts it
3764000	3766000	A general hardware error
3766000	3768000	Hmmmm
3768000	3770000	General hardware error
3770000	3772000	You say
3772000	3774000	That's funny because there's
3774000	3776000	Three lights of death I guess
3776000	3778000	There's also a general hardware error
3778000	3780000	And we don't see many of those anymore
3780000	3782000	Hmmmm
3782000	3784000	And then all of a sudden
3784000	3786000	After the new Xbox experience
3786000	3788000	Was installed
3788000	3790000	We started seeing a lot more of these E74 errors
3790000	3792000	In fact the dramatic increase of them
3792000	3794000	And
3794000	3796000	What's interesting though
3796000	3798000	Is people are kind of
3798000	3800000	Getting all conspiracy theory mode here
3800000	3802000	And thinking
3802000	3804000	Microsoft has
3804000	3806000	Specifically stated that they're gonna
3806000	3808000	Warranty these three
3808000	3810000	Red light
3810000	3812000	Errors
3812000	3814000	But the E74 errors are not
3814000	3816000	Part of that three year warranty
3816000	3818000	They're just part of the one year warranty
3818000	3820000	Is this a way for Microsoft to get out of
3820000	3822000	Warrenting those consoles that would normally be
3822000	3824000	Under the red ring
3824000	3826000	But now they have reprogrammed the error
3826000	3828000	Displaying to just do this
3828000	3830000	E74 error instead of the three red lights
3830000	3832000	Is kind of a way to save some money if you think about it
3832000	3834000	So it's actually the same
3834000	3836000	Same errors but
3836000	3838000	He's played a different way
3838000	3840000	This is all conspiracy though
3840000	3842000	Here's my question about the polling
3842000	3844000	And my initial thought when I saw these polls
3844000	3846000	Is how accurate is this
3846000	3848000	To post this on a video game website
3848000	3850000	Have you had this problem yes or no
3850000	3852000	How many people are actually gonna click yes
3852000	3854000	To that survey as opposed to those that are gonna
3854000	3856000	Click no because they're pissed off
3856000	3858000	I think for that reason alone
3858000	3860000	The statistic is skewed completely
3860000	3862000	The problem I think is
3862000	3864000	It's relevant to show that there's a point there
3864000	3866000	That it is happening
3866000	3868000	And it's happening frequently
3868000	3870000	But it's not happening nearly as much as the sites say they are
3870000	3872000	I think this way of polling people
3872000	3874000	Is not statistically so
3874000	3876000	I don't know what the actual statistics are
3876000	3878000	I do know that there are a lot more of them now
3878000	3880000	Than there were before
3880000	3882000	Which is a little kind of huh you know
3882000	3884000	And then a lot less red rings to death
3884000	3886000	And granted you can say okay maybe they're improving the hardware
3886000	3888000	But I have a feeling that
3888000	3890000	I would not be surprised if this is actually what's going on
3890000	3892000	But no one's ever gonna admit to it
3892000	3894000	They're not gonna say oh yeah we changed it
3894000	3896000	So that you know we don't have to pay out on the warranties
3896000	3898000	Yeah like they would actually do that
3898000	3900000	And you know admit to it
3900000	3902000	There'd be all sorts of lawsuits
3902000	3904000	But
3904000	3906000	I've actually you know
3906000	3908000	Most of my consoles have died either
3908000	3910000	With the three rings to death
3910000	3912000	I've only had one that didn't die that way
3912000	3914000	And it never actually popped up in error message
3914000	3916000	In the video so if it did
3916000	3918000	I would have never known
3918000	3920000	But I'm not surprised
3920000	3922000	That something like this is going on
3922000	3924000	But who knows
3924000	3926000	I mean this may become the new red ring to death thing
3926000	3928000	And you know now it's the E74 error
3928000	3930000	And it also could be you know
3930000	3932000	A way to say hey look
3932000	3934000	You know statistics
3934000	3936000	Are the three ring errors you know now
3936000	3938000	You know drop down to nothing you know
3938000	3940000	So hey look we're doing good
3940000	3942000	But really they're just kind of
3942000	3944000	You know shuffling to the side
3944000	3946000	That's shady I hope it's just a conspiracy
3946000	3948000	You're talking about there
3948000	3950000	Tigerclaw in chat makes a good point
3950000	3952000	Microsoft will have to repair the console with the E74 errors
3952000	3954000	Regardless they don't want to end up with more bad PR
3954000	3956000	Isn't that true? One way or another they're going to have to fix them anyway
3956000	3958000	But these consoles are past
3958000	3960000	That's the thing though
3960000	3962000	They don't have to fix them because there's a three year warranty
3962000	3964000	But if all these consoles start showing up
3964000	3966000	With the E74 aren't they
3966000	3968000	You know if they're newer consoles or what have you
3968000	3970000	Aren't they going to have to fix them anyway
3970000	3972000	If they're in the one year warranty otherwise
3972000	3974000	You have to pay $100 to fix it
3974000	3976000	That's where they get you because it's not the three rings
3976000	3978000	But it would be just like before
3978000	3980000	They were trying to charge $100 to all these people
3980000	3982000	With the red rings and the internet revolted
3982000	3984000	Isn't that same thing going to happen? Yeah but prove it
3984000	3986000	I mean that's the thing they're going to have to prove it
3986000	3988000	That that's actually going on
3988000	3990000	And I just find it a little shady that there's this
3990000	3992000	Error message that has the same description
3992000	3994000	As this other error message
3994000	3996000	That's you know really bad you know
3996000	3998000	It's like well it's a general
3998000	4000000	Hardware failure
4000000	4002000	Okay what's that mean you know
4002000	4004000	Is this any different than the three rings
4004000	4006000	Well it's a general hardware failure of
4006000	4008000	The graphics chip or the
4008000	4010000	Scaler chip or something else
4010000	4012000	Well that's exactly what the other one was
4012000	4014000	So
4014000	4016000	How's this any different? Oh it's not
4016000	4018000	Okay
4018000	4020000	I don't know I just hope I don't ever get one of these
4020000	4022000	I hope not either or there will be hell to pay
4022000	4024000	On the show just like when I got the red rings
4024000	4026000	I was so pissed about that thankfully
4026000	4028000	I went out of town
4028000	4030000	Anyhow we got some release dates we got to cover
4030000	4032000	And I'll start off in Japan with the Japanese
4032000	4034000	Release dates and talking about the Xbox 360
4034000	4036000	Eleven Eyes crossover
4036000	4038000	Is coming out in Japan
4038000	4040000	This is not a game I've heard of I'm wondering if it's just
4040000	4042000	A
4042000	4044000	Localized version of one of our titles
4044000	4046000	But it doesn't look like it looks like this is a new
4046000	4048000	Type of game I guess it's based on an anime
4048000	4050000	Because it looks like there's eleven chicks that this game
4050000	4052000	Stars it is an adventure
4052000	4054000	What was it again? It's called
4054000	4056000	Eleven Eyes crossover
4056000	4058000	Huh
4058000	4060000	So I don't know
4060000	4062000	What do you think of that three by three eyes?
4062000	4064000	I think it's different
4064000	4066000	On the Playstation 3 winning post world is a game coming out from Koei
4066000	4068000	This week on April the 2nd
4068000	4070000	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii
4070000	4072000	Dwalla de Wii winning post world
4072000	4074000	Also comes out on the Wii
4074000	4076000	Whoa whoa is that Dwalla?
4076000	4078000	That's the
4078000	4080000	Mascot
4080000	4082000	Yeah a little koala bear for their team
4082000	4084000	Yeah that's cute
4084000	4086000	So I'm assuming that's like a little baseball game that's coming out of there
4086000	4088000	No they're calling it a party game
4088000	4090000	So maybe it's like a baseball party game
4090000	4092000	Sports party
4092000	4094000	Who knows
4094000	4096000	So that's pretty cool
4096000	4098000	Yeah I think our friend that we both have on LiveJournal
4098000	4100000	Deanna who's been spending a lot of time over in Japan
4100000	4102000	I think I've seen pictures of her with that character
4102000	4104000	Yeah I actually
4104000	4106000	A while back I had like a little
4106000	4108000	Keychain thing that someone sent me
4108000	4110000	So I thought it was cool
4110000	4112000	Oh
4112000	4114000	Winning post world also makes its way to the Playstation 2
4114000	4116000	This is hitting multiple systems this week
4116000	4118000	I'm not exactly sure exactly what
4118000	4120000	Oh this is
4120000	4122000	Oh it's a horse racing game
4122000	4124000	I was gonna say is it the same thing as winning 11
4124000	4126000	But it's not it's a horse racing game
4126000	4128000	But it looks pretty intricate
4128000	4130000	Soccer on horses that's awesome
4130000	4132000	Isn't that just polo?
4132000	4134000	No that's croquet on horses
4134000	4136000	Yeah that'd be croquet on horses
4136000	4138000	That's a very good description of polo
4138000	4140000	Croquet on horses
4140000	4142000	Why is it not more popular here?
4142000	4144000	It sounds kinda awesome
4144000	4146000	Now what would you call it like if you had like one of those fantasy
4146000	4148000	Games where it's actual
4148000	4150000	Horses playing croquet
4150000	4152000	Would that still be considered polo?
4152000	4154000	Because you know it's a horses playing
4154000	4156000	The game I think it would be considered a fucking miracle
4156000	4158000	It would be an anamorphic croquet
4158000	4160000	Anyhow
4160000	4162000	On the Nintendo DS
4162000	4164000	Coming out in Japan on the 2nd of April
4164000	4166000	Disney fairies Tinkerbell comes out
4166000	4168000	As well as another pechi slot game from
4168000	4170000	Durasu also pro
4170000	4172000	Yaku Famitsa DS
4172000	4174000	2009 comes out from Bandai Namco
4174000	4176000	Which is yet another baseball game
4176000	4178000	Coming out from Namco with little
4178000	4180000	Chibi characters in it
4180000	4182000	On the Playstation portable
4182000	4184000	Which is the last system we cover over there
4184000	4186000	The Legend of Heroes
4186000	4188000	A lot of them move into
4188000	4190000	Price reductions
4190000	4192000	And that's really it unless you want to get some new
4192000	4194000	Covers for your PS in black, silver
4194000	4196000	And white, that's really it
4196000	4198000	So I guess Tinker, yes
4198000	4200000	As AlphaCananagram in chat says fuck yes
4200000	4202000	Tinkerbell definitely seems to be
4202000	4204000	One of the highlights on the Japanese release calendar
4204000	4206000	This week, things look a little better next week though
4206000	4208000	It's a slow week
4208000	4210000	Is it? Yes
4210000	4212000	How about going in another direction?
4212000	4214000	How about it? For our friends in the UK
4214000	4216000	On the 27th we have

4222000	4224000	Bizarro
4224000	4226000	Freaky hair
4226000	4228000	I guess

4230000	4232000	For DS and Wii
4232000	4234000	Goblins 4 for PC

4238000	4240000	Well this one doesn't have a date on it
4240000	4242000	It might have already come out
4242000	4244000	Crimecraft
4244000	4246000	Also though on April 3rd
4246000	4248000	We get Disgaea DS

4258000	4260000	Alright
4260000	4262000	Well in the US
4262000	4264000	There's not a whole lot coming out this week
4264000	4266000	In fact a lot of it's crap
4266000	4268000	But that's okay
4268000	4270000	Because where there's crap
4270000	4272000	There's crap I guess
4272000	4274000	There is no positive there
4274000	4276000	The flowers grow? Yeah the flowers grow
4276000	4278000	Speaking of flowers! Gardening Marla
4278000	4280000	Coming out on the DS

4310000	4312000	Where Marla's in a role playing game

4314000	4316000	I wanna see DM Marla
4316000	4318000	Where she's running the game
4318000	4320000	There you go

4322000	4324000	She slays the dragon
4324000	4326000	We've got Don King Boxing coming out on the Wii
4326000	4328000	You may remember that as Don King's Prize Fighter
4328000	4330000	They just changed the name so you forget how bad it was
4330000	4332000	Ski-Doo

4334000	4336000	360, it's a snowmobile
4336000	4338000	racing game
4338000	4340000	Tokyo Beatdown
4340000	4342000	A traditional kind of
4342000	4344000	beat-em-up fighting game
4344000	4346000	or fighting action game
4346000	4348000	Coming from Atlas for the DS
4348000	4350000	which is pretty cool
4350000	4352000	Our music fans will love this
4352000	4354000	Major Miners Majestic March coming out on the Wii
4354000	4356000	You may remember the creators of Parappa the Rapper
4356000	4358000	created this
4358000	4360000	Oh yes I do
4360000	4362000	Marching Band
4362000	4364000	Bobby you listening?
4364000	4366000	It's a marching band game
4366000	4368000	I was in marching band
4368000	4370000	Me too but Bobby still does it
4370000	4372000	I know he plays drums
4372000	4374000	and shows
4374000	4376000	musicals
4376000	4378000	that come through his town
4378000	4380000	I could swear
4380000	4382000	and he's gonna pop and chat any minute I'm sure
4382000	4384000	I could swear he talked about Drum Corps
4384000	4386000	he still does stuff now and again with that
4386000	4388000	and that's kind of marching band
4388000	4390000	Leisure Suit
4390000	4392000	The Bus coming out on the Xbox 360 and PC
4392000	4394000	No nudity in that game
4394000	4396000	so I have no interest in it whatsoever
4396000	4398000	Dawn King Boxing
4398000	4400000	also coming to the DS
4400000	4402000	Yippee
4402000	4404000	Cradle of Rome coming to the Wii
4404000	4406000	which is another one of those
4406000	4408000	bejeweled knockoffs
4408000	4410000	Let's see here
4410000	4412000	and then
4412000	4414000	Vomit
4414000	4416000	like crap
4416000	4418000	Ok this is kind of
4418000	4420000	well another Dance Dance Revolution game
4420000	4422000	Disney Grooves now for the Wii
4422000	4424000	Hoz Party 2 with
4424000	4426000	Disney characters now
4426000	4428000	this isn't a game but I thought I'd mention it because it's pretty cool
4428000	4430000	Mad Catz has a new charging
4430000	4432000	dock coming out that charges
4432000	4434000	two controllers but what makes it special
4434000	4436000	though is it's the Rayman Rabbids
4436000	4438000	charging dock so there's a Rabbid
4438000	4440000	sitting there yelling at you
4440000	4442000	unfortunately it doesn't make noise because that would be awesome
4442000	4444000	and then
4444000	4446000	one last game coming out a week from today
4446000	4448000	Rhythm Heaven and of course
4448000	4450000	a tie along with that
4450000	4452000	Nintendo DSi coming out in black and blue
4452000	4454000	so
4454000	4456000	well that's why this is a slow
4456000	4458000	week because you have those two bombshells coming out
4458000	4460000	yes the DSi
4460000	4462000	is going to be pretty big
4462000	4464000	and then
4464000	4466000	that's pretty much it for right now
4466000	4468000	wow
4468000	4470000	now of course us talking about the Mama games
4470000	4472000	you spawned everybody in chat
4472000	4474000	talking about Mama in games
4474000	4476000	this is definitely my favorite Mama game
4476000	4478000	I mean we had 2DX Mama
4478000	4480000	we have Pop'n Music 18
4480000	4482000	Mama, Mama in Space
4482000	4484000	Neon Mama in Evangelion
4484000	4486000	my favorite though
4486000	4488000	from GS68 this is definitely my favorite Mama title
4488000	4490000	Mama vs. Capcom
4490000	4492000	that's pretty
4492000	4494000	scary
4494000	4496000	I was going to mention there is one more thing
4496000	4498000	this will make Jamie happy coming out
4498000	4500000	it's not a
4500000	4502000	game you can buy in the stores
4502000	4504000	online on Xbox Live Arcade
4504000	4506000	this week Outrun
4506000	4508000	yay
4508000	4510000	yes new Outrun game is going to be coming out
4510000	4512000	that's not old school Outrun getting upgraded
4512000	4514000	Outrun online arcade
4514000	4516000	but now see
4516000	4518000	that could be yay or that could be OMG Suck
4518000	4520000	if Yuji Naka is involved
4520000	4522000	it'll be good
4522000	4524000	the screenshots I've seen of it look pretty awesome
4524000	4526000	and they do some
4526000	4528000	neat camera stuff where
4528000	4530000	when you're drifting around some of the bends
4530000	4532000	it actually looks really cool
4532000	4534000	and Cell Factor Psychokinetic Wars
4534000	4536000	I could use a fun silly little
4536000	4538000	racing game that's not too serious
4538000	4540000	like a lot of the Xbox 360 racing games are too serious
4540000	4542000	for me I could use a fun silly little one
4542000	4544000	there's a bunch of stuff that's listed on here
4544000	4546000	that's supposedly coming out this week I'm not sure if all this is
4546000	4548000	Banjo-Tooie they're saying
4548000	4550000	I don't know that sounds kind of weird
4550000	4552000	I know one of these titles that's on this Kotaku
4552000	4554000	list is not correct Duke Nukem Trilogy
4554000	4556000	that's not coming out until September
4556000	4558000	it's funny it's coming out April 1st
4558000	4560000	you're the fool
4560000	4562000	because it's not coming out yet
4562000	4564000	what a Duke Nukem title delayed?
4564000	4566000	never
4566000	4568000	sorry that's alright
4568000	4570000	alright so we got
4570000	4572000	one more story for you guys then we're going to get to our classic
4572000	4574000	game of the week and this has to do with
4574000	4576000	Left 4 Dead which a lot of people
4576000	4578000	I know in our Steam community are still playing Left 4 Dead
4578000	4580000	this is a game I need to spend more quality time
4580000	4582000	with I played it for like a little bit and I found out
4582000	4584000	I suck at first person shooters really bad
4584000	4586000	but I need to go try to get a little better
4586000	4588000	however there is a new
4588000	4590000	download content pack coming out for
4590000	4592000	Left 4 Dead and it's coming out on April
4592000	4594000	21st for Xbox 360 gamers

4596000	4598000	survival mode and
4598000	4600000	just wave after wave of zombies

4602000	4604000	with two more maps Dead Air and
4604000	4606000	Death Toll

4608000	4610000	we like free things
4610000	4612000	right? free is awesome
4612000	4614000	except Yaris
4614000	4616000	okay we're just about to the
4616000	4618000	end of the show but of course no show
4618000	4620000	here at Orange Laundry will be complete
4620000	4622000	without the classic game of the week
4622000	4624000	actually we're only like half way done I don't want you to think
4624000	4626000	we're like actually done but we like to end part A
4626000	4628000	with the classic video game of the week
4628000	4630000	Dark Sakura goes through her dusty archives
4630000	4632000	of games and finds a game or two
4632000	4634000	maybe that she thinks you ought to be playing
4634000	4636000	and so Dark Sakura
4636000	4638000	what is your classic
4638000	4640000	game of the week?
4640000	4642000	my classic game of the week is Twinbee
4642000	4644000	which
4644000	4646000	of course we saw
4646000	4648000	a while back what
4648000	4650000	it's labeled as Rainbow Bell
4650000	4652000	I always remembered it as Twinbee so
4652000	4654000	whatever
4656000	4658000	is that familiar?
4658000	4660000	anybody that's played
4660000	4662000	the Bimani games long enough have heard some
4662000	4664000	form of the Twinbee theme in the game
4664000	4666000	this is the thing that annoys
4666000	4668000	me about Twinbee
4668000	4670000	is that every time you get a damn power up
4670000	4672000	it plays that little noise
4672000	4674000	and starts moving it over
4674000	4676000	but anyway Twinbee is a game where you
4676000	4678000	play as a little ship with arms
4678000	4680000	and you shoot
4680000	4682000	bells for your power ups and you change the color
4682000	4684000	of your bell
4684000	4686000	actually they pop out of the clouds and you shoot the clouds
4686000	4688000	and the bells will change color and you'll get a different
4688000	4690000	power up
4690000	4692000	but you just have to keep shooting it until
4692000	4694000	you
4694000	4696000	until you
4696000	4698000	get the one that you want but if you keep shooting it
4698000	4700000	it'll change into a symbol that will kill you
4700000	4702000	so
4702000	4704000	you can play as
4704000	4706000	you've got two characters in here you can play as
4706000	4708000	and it came out
4708000	4710000	for the Famicom
4710000	4712000	and it came out actually in the cartridge and disk format
4712000	4714000	the MSX
4714000	4716000	it came out, it was of course arcade
4716000	4718000	and
4718000	4720000	then we also saw Twinbee
4720000	4722000	portable for the Sony PSP
4722000	4724000	and the Konami Classic series
4724000	4726000	arcade hits for the Nintendo DS
4726000	4728000	now
4728000	4730000	I bring up Twinbee because Twinbee
4730000	4732000	leads to
4732000	4734000	actually
4734000	4736000	the one that I like better than this
4736000	4738000	can I say this though in chat real quick we have somebody saying
4738000	4740000	isn't this Stinger?
4740000	4742000	yes you got to do Stinger
4742000	4744000	so in the US it was called Stinger
4744000	4746000	yeah in the US it was Stinger
4746000	4748000	but now let's
4748000	4750000	move forward
4750000	4752000	sure let me queue up the other game here
4752000	4754000	tell them a little bit about this
4754000	4756000	now this is the one that I like better and one that my husband
4756000	4758000	and I played the crap out of last night
4758000	4760000	is Detana Twinbee
4760000	4762000	which
4762000	4764000	is
4764000	4766000	they actually came out in Europe
4766000	4768000	as bells and whistles
4768000	4770000	so anyway
4770000	4772000	this is the sequel to the original Twinbee
4772000	4774000	but the arcade
4774000	4776000	and Famicom versions and it plays
4776000	4778000	pretty much the same but it has
4778000	4780000	much much better graphics
4780000	4782000	and music in Project MC
4782000	4784000	yeah I've never seen
4784000	4786000	this game before this is pretty sweet
4786000	4788000	for an old school like 16 bit
4788000	4790000	era game this is pretty sweet
4790000	4792000	it also had little cut scenes that were in between
4792000	4794000	levels where you could see different
4794000	4796000	characters hanging around
4796000	4798000	actually one person plays as Twinbee
4798000	4800000	the other one plays as Winbee
4800000	4802000	and you can also get
4802000	4804000	a ghost
4804000	4806000	pilot which was
4806000	4808000	oh god
4808000	4810000	now I can't remember what it was called
4810000	4812000	it's definitely not in the article I'm looking at
4812000	4814000	but the green one
4814000	4816000	no I never played this game enough
4816000	4818000	oh but anyway you can also get
4818000	4820000	like a sort of ghost pilot that will hang out with you
4820000	4822000	um
4822000	4824000	and uh
4824000	4826000	it brings in the pilots of Twinbee and Winbee
4826000	4828000	which is Light and Pastel
4828000	4830000	um
4830000	4832000	also it's um you can actually get this game
4832000	4834000	in the Twinbee deluxe pack
4834000	4836000	for Playstation and Saturn
4836000	4838000	could be portable for Playstation portable
4838000	4840000	PSP sorry um
4840000	4842000	the version that I linked here is the PC
4842000	4844000	Engine version um
4844000	4846000	it also came out on the
4846000	4848000	X68000
4848000	4850000	and um
4850000	4852000	it's actually um out
4852000	4854000	um on Virtual Console
4854000	4856000	now so you can get it too
4856000	4858000	um
4858000	4860000	another thing that was cool about this one
4860000	4862000	is that it actually led to um
4862000	4864000	a Twinbee
4864000	4866000	OVO
4866000	4868000	that was actually kind of cool
4868000	4870000	but yeah this
4870000	4872000	whenever I think of Twinbee this is the game I actually think of
4872000	4874000	because it was so much fun
4874000	4876000	like some of the power ups you can get are so cool
4876000	4878000	like you've got a shadow
4878000	4880000	I think the shadow is if you hit
4880000	4882000	no red is you get a barrier
4882000	4884000	um purple is the um
4884000	4886000	the multiple
4886000	4888000	image following after you
4888000	4890000	and then you can get like you know
4890000	4892000	different directional shots you can extend your shot
4892000	4894000	you can get all kinds of different
4894000	4896000	you can actually get shadows
4896000	4898000	that follow you behind too
4898000	4900000	um you also have a charge move where you can shoot
4900000	4902000	out like a big stream of fire
4902000	4904000	and if you use your bomb button you can target
4904000	4906000	things that are on the ground
4906000	4908000	and shoot um
4908000	4910000	things that are on
4910000	4912000	the ground
4912000	4914000	like that with bombs
4914000	4916000	um but this is
4916000	4918000	to me this is probably
4918000	4920000	one of the pinnacle of
4920000	4922000	um shooting games
4922000	4924000	really is
4924000	4926000	and it's cute
4926000	4928000	and it's super cute
4928000	4930000	but don't don't don't
4930000	4932000	you know think differently because it's cute
4932000	4934000	it gets hard
4934000	4936000	you get flying like
4936000	4938000	looks can be deceiving
4938000	4940000	where I died is when all these freaking chickens appear in air
4940000	4942000	and run at you
4942000	4944000	you know I think I died in Zelda that way once
4944000	4946000	seriously it's like oh flying around
4946000	4948000	chickens run
4948000	4950000	dead die
4950000	4952000	yeah
4952000	4954000	and of course it's got beautiful voices too
4954000	4956000	and the music in it is freaking fantastic
4956000	4958000	so it's Detina Twinbee
4958000	4960000	alright there it is
4960000	4962000	Konami give us a new Twinbee
4962000	4964000	there it is folks your classic game of the week
4964000	4966000	Twinbee, Stinger, Rainbow, Bell
4966000	4968000	more importantly the game
4968000	4970000	that inspired Detina Twinbee
4970000	4972000	for the PC Engine
4972000	4974000	there it is your classic game of the week
4974000	4976000	that's going to be a hard one for folks to find
4976000	4978000	last week was easy you did what Secret of Mana
4978000	4980000	two weeks ago because we weren't here last week
4980000	4982000	you did Secret of Mana two weeks ago right?
4982000	4984000	if you've got money
4984000	4986000	or virtual console now
4986000	4988000	I was really referring to playing it on the sneeze
4988000	4990000	alright well there you go
4990000	4992000	I will say
4992000	4994000	you can get a PC Engine
4994000	4996000	core graphics for not
4996000	4998000	too much money if you know where to look
4998000	5000000	which would be where are you going to share?
5000000	5002000	was it
5002000	5004000	Pink Elephant I think
5004000	5006000	was the company
5006000	5008000	oh that was it
5008000	5010000	oh the folks that were at PAX
5010000	5012000	we got ours at Classic Gaming Expo
5012000	5014000	a while back so I'll see if I can't find the name of it
5014000	5016000	and put it up on the forum
5016000	5018000	oh my god you've got an SUV on a building
5018000	5020000	anyway
5020000	5022000	my
5022000	5024000	that's awesome
5024000	5026000	okay I'm being distracted by falling cars
5026000	5028000	but also the HuCard for Twinbee
5028000	5030000	actually shouldn't be that
5030000	5032000	expensive if you
5032000	5034000	have someone buy it for you in Japan
5034000	5036000	I don't really think the HuCard is that
5036000	5038000	expensive at all I will tell you
5038000	5040000	one thing if you're trying to play a HuCard on
5040000	5042000	an American system none of the
5042000	5044000	converters really work even if you've got that
5044000	5046000	purple one it's freaking expensive
5046000	5048000	and it works half the time so don't even bother
5048000	5050000	with it just get a PC Engine
5050000	5052000	the end
5052000	5054000	alright well we're going to take
5054000	5056000	a break here and come back with more of Orange Lounge

5084000	5086000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this
5086000	5088000	Sunday evening March the 29th of 2009
5088000	5090000	where we're taping live
5090000	5092000	on All Games Radio www.allgames.com
5092000	5094000	bringing you
5094000	5096000	more of the latest and greatest in video
5096000	5098000	games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
5098000	5100000	we also do a little
5100000	5102000	simulcast on
5102000	5104000	Justin TV where tonight
5104000	5106000	you're not looking at our ugly mugs doing the show
5106000	5108000	we thought maybe there'd be something a little more exciting
5108000	5110000	if we have a video well A I actually
5110000	5112000	lost the camera but I think this is actually working out
5112000	5114000	where Loki's actually playing a game during the show and
5114000	5116000	tonight he's playing Grand Theft Auto 4 but he's playing a special
5116000	5118000	version that he
5118000	5120000	hacked the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto
5120000	5122000	and it has super uber physics in it
5122000	5124000	yeah it has if you're
5124000	5126000	a fan of the PC version it has the
5126000	5128000	Super Comet which I added those
5128000	5130000	physics to the bus and to the ambulance
5130000	5132000	and then I modified
5132000	5134000	the
5134000	5136000	Mac I think it's the
5136000	5138000	Mac 11 in there to have a
5138000	5140000	pretty fast
5140000	5142000	fire rate and
5142000	5144000	almost a thousand rounds
5144000	5146000	in a clip and then
5146000	5148000	my punching has
5148000	5150000	a physics force of
5150000	5152000	60,000 so I can punch cars
5152000	5154000	into space basically
5154000	5156000	so
5156000	5158000	so you're gonna continue
5158000	5160000	to kind of play that throughout the show
5160000	5162000	but you gotta start you gotta pause it and do some news
5162000	5164000	cause we wanna talk about some Sony news
5164000	5166000	here real quick yes
5166000	5168000	so there's this alternate
5168000	5170000	reality game that's going on in
5170000	5172000	home right now thanks
5172000	5174000	to Sony the game
5174000	5176000	is called well it's
5176000	5178000	xi or she or
5178000	5180000	as I'm calling it cross eyed
5180000	5182000	I don't know the symbol itself doesn't look like xi
5182000	5184000	so I don't know where they're getting that from it kind of
5184000	5186000	looks like an hourglass or something
5186000	5188000	but whatever
5188000	5190000	but anyways they have a
5190000	5192000	trailer that was released I guess and
5192000	5194000	I haven't really gotten a chance to
5194000	5196000	do any of this
5196000	5198000	but apparently they have like a weekly
5198000	5200000	recap and there's some sort of
5200000	5202000	like clues you need to find and
5202000	5204000	kind of a ticker and stuff so
5204000	5206000	um
5206000	5208000	so you said it's the Greek symbol?
5208000	5210000	it's the Greek symbol so it's xi
5210000	5212000	Greek symbol really?
5212000	5214000	yes
5214000	5216000	what if this has to do with anything that's probably gonna tie in
5216000	5218000	with an announcement for God of War 3
5218000	5220000	or at least a release date or something like that
5220000	5222000	I wonder I wonder I wonder
5222000	5224000	ooh you're smart
5224000	5226000	but really no
5226000	5228000	and it's the summer right now
5228000	5230000	so July
5230000	5232000	anyways so I don't know what exactly
5232000	5234000	this is gonna be unveiling
5234000	5236000	I'm sure it's gonna
5236000	5238000	waste enough time to
5238000	5240000	E3 and maybe it'll make some sort of announcement
5240000	5242000	that ties in with everything
5242000	5244000	but hey who doesn't like a good
5244000	5246000	ARG I mean you know
5246000	5248000	I heart bees or I love bees or something like that
5248000	5250000	yeah
5250000	5252000	so cool if you want to check it out just
5252000	5254000	go in the home
5254000	5256000	I should sue for copyright because that's how people mispronounce
5256000	5258000	my name all the time is xi
5258000	5260000	it's xi
5260000	5262000	like KSI
5262000	5264000	xer xi
5264000	5266000	no I just no I think low key
5266000	5268000	at the nail on the head though if it's for anything
5268000	5270000	it is probably some type of underground
5270000	5272000	campaign for God of War 3
5272000	5274000	yeah sounds like
5274000	5276000	but it's interesting though don't you think it's interesting that they're actually kind of
5276000	5278000	doing new shit with home?
5278000	5280000	I mean that's what's kind of nice about it
5280000	5282000	it's nice that they're actually doing shit with home
5282000	5284000	although they still don't have like
5284000	5286000	what the trophy rooms and stuff that they had promised
5286000	5288000	in the beginning I mean whatever happened to that
5288000	5290000	maybe someday I don't know
5290000	5292000	or better functionality with the groups
5292000	5294000	that whole thing
5294000	5296000	yeah who knows
5296000	5298000	alright well anyhow let's talk about some other news at a Game Developers Conference
5298000	5300000	you know we talked about OnLive
5300000	5302000	which is a new console of sorts
5302000	5304000	not really a console but this is a console
5304000	5306000	now there's something else here
5306000	5308000	Tektoy is putting out a new console
5308000	5310000	the Zeebo
5310000	5312000	and it's going to do just downloadable games
5312000	5314000	which might make you think about the Phantom and all that stuff
5314000	5316000	I don't know
5316000	5318000	but the Zeebo here's the catch
5318000	5320000	it's coming out in Brazil this July
5320000	5322000	so it's not something that's necessarily being targeted here
5322000	5324000	at markets over here in North America
5324000	5326000	it's coming out first in Brazil
5326000	5328000	and then I guess some other markets maybe in South America
5328000	5330000	or other places
5330000	5332000	what's interesting
5332000	5334000	Quake, Evil Prey and Action Hero 3D
5334000	5336000	are some of the titles that are supposed to be already on the console
5336000	5338000	by the time you get it
5338000	5340000	it's not something that's supposed to compete with the Wii
5340000	5342000	the 360 or the Playstation 3
5342000	5344000	apparently what this console is going to do
5344000	5346000	it actually connects to a large 3G network
5346000	5348000	through a big cellular provider
5348000	5350000	and apparently
5350000	5352000	it's not necessarily about being the most powerful system out there
5352000	5354000	but it's supposed to be about
5354000	5356000	getting stuff through download channels
5356000	5358000	to help combat
5358000	5360000	piracy that goes on
5360000	5362000	but this is interesting
5362000	5364000	EA Mobile, Capcom, Namco Networks
5364000	5366000	PopCap Games, THQ, they're all on board
5366000	5368000	and it's going to cost about
5368000	5370000	$7 to $13
5370000	5372000	per game
5372000	5374000	I converted to American dollars there for you
5374000	5376000	the console itself, $264 American
5376000	5378000	though
5378000	5380000	the question though, I mean
5380000	5382000	I'm not really familiar with mobile games too much
5382000	5384000	is there really that much piracy of mobile games?
5384000	5386000	I mean
5386000	5388000	I would think that they're not losing that much money on that stuff
5388000	5390000	that's just my thought
5390000	5392000	YYR in chat
5392000	5394000	has a funny thought about the trophy room
5394000	5396000	that you'll have to buy the trophy room for 99 cents
5396000	5398000	and then you'll have to buy the bookshelf
5398000	5400000	and the trophy room for 49 cents each
5400000	5402000	because they can each only hold 3 trophies
5404000	5406000	I thought he was being serious at first
5406000	5408000	but no, I don't think that's real
5408000	5410000	anyhow, so yeah
5410000	5412000	there is a new console coming out just not in the part of the world
5412000	5414000	where most of you are from
5414000	5416000	but I do know we have some international listeners
5416000	5418000	so maybe this is something some of our international listeners
5418000	5420000	might get their hands on
5420000	5422000	and see if it's worth it or not
5422000	5424000	although probably the folks listening to this program
5424000	5426000	are already importing the more expensive stuff
5426000	5428000	$260 whatever dollars
5428000	5430000	American, I think $599 brazilian
5430000	5432000	for that system
5432000	5434000	is a bargain compared to what you would pay
5434000	5436000	for a lot of the consoles imported down there
5436000	5438000	so something to think about
5438000	5440000	yeah
5440000	5442000	well, there's actually
5442000	5444000	some news on the more
5444000	5446000	conventional system
5446000	5448000	I guess front
5448000	5450000	there is a
5450000	5452000	Katamari Damacy
5452000	5454000	tribute coming to
5454000	5456000	Playstation 3
5456000	5458000	the original one
5458000	5460000	is
5460000	5462000	well, the
5462000	5464000	original version I guess is supposed to be in
5464000	5466000	Katamari Damacy tribute
5466000	5468000	where it will be presented in
5468000	5470000	1080p
5470000	5472000	and have a new visual presentation
5472000	5474000	that's a quote
5474000	5476000	it's going to have
5476000	5478000	remixes
5478000	5480000	from the previous titles
5480000	5482000	as far as the music is concerned
5482000	5484000	and it's
5484000	5486000	I'm guessing it's a big
5486000	5488000	Katamari mashup
5488000	5490000	yeah, I think it's a bunch of the levels from the other games
5490000	5492000	wish there was some new stuff
5492000	5494000	it's still going to be fun
5494000	5496000	oh yeah
5496000	5498000	I'll have to pick it up
5498000	5500000	weird six axis stuff
5500000	5502000	no, they got rid of the six axis
5502000	5504000	no, I'm actually kind of surprised
5504000	5506000	that they're doing it as a download title too
5506000	5508000	because you would think something like that would definitely be able to sell at retail
5508000	5510000	six axis is still there
5510000	5512000	flower is run completely on six axis
5512000	5514000	it's actually fairly effective
5514000	5516000	I hate the six axis though
5516000	5518000	for some games it's okay
5518000	5520000	like flower, I think is a great game
5520000	5524000	it's not something you're going to invest a lot of time in
5524000	5526000	but for what it is, it's great
5526000	5528000	sorry bogey
5528000	5530000	so, I mean that would be pretty cool
5530000	5532000	I mean
5532000	5534000	I just don't understand
5534000	5536000	I would think they'd make more money at retail
5536000	5538000	if they brought it out
5538000	5540000	but maybe they just want less
5540000	5542000	you know
5542000	5544000	packaging or something, I don't know
5544000	5546000	whatever
5546000	5548000	something else that's coming the way of the PS3
5548000	5550000	and we were talking about home a little bit earlier
5550000	5552000	they're going to get some new spaces actually
5552000	5554000	including
5554000	5556000	a Guitar Hero themed space
5556000	5558000	called backstage with Guitar Hero
5558000	5560000	and of course
5560000	5562000	they're going to have
5562000	5564000	you know, all the House of Blues
5564000	5566000	kind of stuff, I guess one of the levels from the game
5566000	5568000	there's also a VIP space
5568000	5570000	in the back, which is sealed off
5570000	5572000	by a velvet rope
5572000	5574000	I'm not sure who they're going to have back there
5574000	5576000	and
5576000	5578000	you know, other than that
5578000	5580000	there's going to be
5580000	5582000	I guess maybe a
5582000	5584000	mini game or something like that
5584000	5586000	Rock God, which is kind of like Simon
5586000	5588000	like matching the cord type thing
5588000	5590000	and then some other
5590000	5592000	possible games may be in there
5592000	5594000	I don't know about you
5594000	5596000	but I think most of these spaces
5596000	5598000	that they have in home are kind of useless
5598000	5600000	you go there once and you're like, oh that's kind of neat
5600000	5602000	and that's about it
5602000	5604000	at least you went there
5604000	5606000	it's a free commercial for the game, right?
5606000	5608000	yeah, but I mean it's not anything real cool
5608000	5610000	like you can't say play
5610000	5612000	the PlayStation 3 version or something like that
5612000	5614000	and your characters appear on stage
5614000	5616000	performing the song
5616000	5618000	or anything like that
5618000	5620000	wasn't there this whole thing though that you were going to be able to launch
5620000	5622000	PlayStation games from within home
5622000	5624000	well I guess you still can kind of do that
5624000	5626000	but I don't know, you just don't see a lot of people actually doing that
5626000	5628000	compared to, I don't know, Xbox 360
5628000	5630000	just kind of seems to make it all easy
5630000	5632000	it's just like home is like a big
5632000	5634000	non-necessity I guess
5634000	5636000	I mean it's cool
5636000	5638000	it has a lot of potential
5638000	5640000	but they're not really using it
5640000	5642000	yeah
5642000	5644000	I don't know, but again anything they do
5644000	5646000	is going to be better than the ASL stuff that's going on right now
5646000	5648000	you know what I mean?
5648000	5650000	any cute girls want to chat, that's pretty much all you ever see
5650000	5652000	in a home, so any of this extra kind of stuff
5652000	5654000	might be kind of neat, I don't know
5654000	5656000	it would be nice if they would have like different types of spaces
5656000	5658000	within home, like you could go to
5658000	5660000	one server for social chat
5660000	5662000	one server for like gamer chat
5662000	5664000	but then again we all know nobody would stay in the zone
5664000	5666000	they're supposed to, so why am I bothering?
5666000	5668000	well PlayStation Home is just going to keep growing
5668000	5670000	you guys, you know there's not only, there's the Red Bull
5670000	5672000	area, there's the Resident Evil 5 area
5672000	5674000	Warhawk, now Guitar Hero, guess what
5674000	5676000	apparently according to Jack Bueser
5676000	5678000	who is the director of PlayStation Home
5678000	5680000	if you think about a game developers conference this week
5680000	5682000	you will see about quote, three new spaces
5682000	5684000	launched a month
5684000	5686000	that does make sense
5686000	5688000	though when you consider there's like over 20 companies
5688000	5690000	that are signed up right now that are supposedly going to be
5690000	5692000	making new content for Home
5692000	5694000	so there you go, apparently Home actually has
5694000	5696000	5 million users already worldwide
5696000	5698000	about half of those being in North America
5698000	5700000	so they say
5700000	5702000	that a good space gets
5702000	5704000	about 250,000 visits
5704000	5706000	every week, and 75%
5706000	5708000	of the users will spend more than
5708000	5710000	10 minutes on the space, and like I said
5710000	5712000	before, you know, despite the quality
5712000	5714000	the fact is, you go into these spaces
5714000	5716000	and it's like a giant advertisement for the game
5716000	5718000	which you might be more likely to buy
5718000	5720000	is that 10 minutes part of the downloading the space
5720000	5722000	or the waiting for the lag, you know
5722000	5724000	might not take that long, watching the
5724000	5726000	loops of Twilight over and over
5726000	5728000	yeah
5728000	5730000	um, yeah
5730000	5732000	I don't know, well they show
5732000	5734000	new movies on there now, don't they?
5734000	5736000	I saw Mall Cop in there for like 2 weeks
5736000	5738000	something
5738000	5740000	alright, well anyhow
5740000	5742000	well, you know what's better than everything in the universe?
5742000	5744000	uh, cake
5744000	5746000	zombies!
5746000	5748000	zombies with cake?
5748000	5750000	ooh, that would be fantastic
5750000	5752000	zombie cake party?
5752000	5754000	I love loathing zombies
5754000	5756000	um, there is a newcomer
5756000	5758000	to the Playstation store
5758000	5760000	that's called Burn Zombie Burn
5760000	5762000	um, that's gonna be
5762000	5764000	on PS3, there's also
5764000	5766000	to go along with that, um
5766000	5768000	is downloadable content for LittleBigPlanet
5768000	5770000	Pain, Resistance 2
5770000	5772000	Endwar, Call of Duty 5
5772000	5774000	and a PS1 copy of Magic Carpet
5774000	5776000	oh my god
5776000	5778000	I remember that game
5778000	5780000	well, Burn Zombie Burn
5780000	5782000	is by Double Six
5782000	5784000	it's going for
5784000	5786000	£6.29
5786000	5788000	in Euros at
5788000	5790000	£7.99
5790000	5792000	um, you have to
5792000	5794000	just hold off zombies
5794000	5796000	for as long as you can
5796000	5798000	and the longer you hold them out
5798000	5800000	the higher score you get
5800000	5802000	where have I heard of this before? Left 4 Dead?
5802000	5804000	the longer you hold off the zombies
5804000	5806000	the more content you unlock
5806000	5808000	based on your score
5808000	5810000	um, for Resistance 2 there's the Aftermath
5810000	5812000	Map Pack
5812000	5814000	and um, Call of Duty
5814000	5816000	World at War will get Map Pack 1
5816000	5818000	and um
5818000	5820000	they actually
5820000	5822000	have to pay more than we did on
5822000	5824000	Xbox, but I think it's supposed to be
5824000	5826000	much more touched up
5826000	5828000	um, there's the Pain Smack Pack
5828000	5830000	the El Chilli Grande
5830000	5832000	um, character
5832000	5834000	um, I guess for that
5834000	5836000	LittleBigPlanet is getting a Buzz
5836000	5838000	costume
5838000	5840000	Endwar and Unreal Tournament 3
5840000	5842000	get the Veteran Map Pack
5842000	5844000	and Titan Pack respectively
5844000	5846000	those are free
5846000	5848000	that's kind of neat that they have
5848000	5850000	some Resistance stuff
5850000	5852000	I just have to actually play through that still
5852000	5854000	well another thing for the PSP is
5854000	5856000	Buzz Brain of the UK
5856000	5858000	hmm
5858000	5860000	so
5860000	5862000	but that's for UK only
5862000	5864000	I think
5864000	5866000	well something we're getting over here
5866000	5868000	at least on the Xbox 360
5868000	5870000	I think it's in
5870000	5872000	where the regions have the
5872000	5874000	Xbox community games
5874000	5876000	and you knew that at some point
5876000	5878000	somebody was going to do something like this
5878000	5880000	well now there's a
5880000	5882000	um, a sex-rated
5882000	5884000	uh, Xbox
5884000	5886000	community game, sex-rated I guess
5886000	5888000	because it's slightly censored but it's still
5888000	5890000	kind of got the naughty stuff in there
5890000	5892000	it's a game
5892000	5894000	called Break One Out
5894000	5896000	and it's basically a Breakout clone
5896000	5898000	or um
5898000	5900000	but what's unique about it though
5900000	5902000	is there's this chick
5902000	5904000	Kitty who looks like a cosplayer
5904000	5906000	and there's revealing
5906000	5908000	photos of her
5908000	5910000	except, you know, where all the naughty bits are covered with black bars
5910000	5912000	but she is naked in the pictures
5912000	5914000	so basically you
5914000	5916000	play the game and you unlock naked
5916000	5918000	pictures of this one chick who
5918000	5920000	I don't know, she's alright
5920000	5922000	she's not hot
5922000	5924000	but you know
5924000	5926000	as hot as I guess a cosplayer
5926000	5928000	at your average anime convention
5928000	5930000	could be
5930000	5932000	I guess somebody made this game
5932000	5934000	just for the sake of making the first
5934000	5936000	controversial titty
5936000	5938000	filled community game, correct?
5938000	5940000	Probably
5940000	5942000	so
5942000	5944000	but, you know, hey
5944000	5946000	that's uh, it's out there
5946000	5948000	and I think it's cheap, I'm not sure if it's like
5948000	5950000	two bucks or something but
5950000	5952000	you know, it doesn't look very good
5952000	5954000	but hey, if you want to see the naked pictures of her
5954000	5956000	I mean, or
5956000	5958000	as naked as she's going to get
5958000	5960000	don't play the game, you can actually watch the video
5960000	5962000	I have a video online for it
5962000	5964000	but uh
5964000	5966000	I don't know, it's just like
5966000	5968000	if you want to knock some balls around while you look at the picture
5968000	5970000	you know, you can play the game
5970000	5972000	or you can watch the video and knock
5972000	5974000	some balls around
5976000	5978000	anyhow
5978000	5980000	YYR is saying that it was
5980000	5982000	only up for a day or less, do you think this thing was already
5982000	5984000	taken down? I wouldn't be surprised
5984000	5986000	it's alright, it was crap
5986000	5988000	I kind of wish I had downloaded it
5988000	5990000	just to have it, but
5990000	5992000	oh well
5992000	5994000	Microsoft
5994000	5996000	is in a little bit of hot water this week over something
5996000	5998000	you've probably seen floating around the game
5998000	6000000	blogs this week, and this has to do with
6000000	6002000	Lionhead Studios, who is of course
6002000	6004000	a subsidiary of Microsoft, they're the folks
6004000	6006000	behind Fable
6006000	6008000	and here's the interesting
6008000	6010000	part of this story
6010000	6012000	it has to do with a gay video game designer
6012000	6014000	and his name is Jamie Durant
6014000	6016000	he's going to be suing Microsoft for
6016000	6018000	45,000 pounds
6018000	6020000	due to hurt feelings, lost pay
6020000	6022000	discrimination, all due to his sexual
6022000	6024000	orientation, and this apparently
6024000	6026000	happened after Microsoft bought Lionhead
6026000	6028000	he's worked for this company for 11 years
6028000	6030000	apparently, and he says
6030000	6032000	things began to get a little bit uneasy around there
6032000	6034000	and starting around January
6034000	6036000	of the last year, he started getting abusive
6036000	6038000	emails, with subjects reading like
6038000	6040000	me and my favorite men
6040000	6042000	I'm Jim and I'm gay, and he was
6042000	6044000	given the nickname, Fag Boy Jim
6044000	6046000	he's
6046000	6048000	apparently complained to the human resources department
6048000	6050000	but nothing happened except
6050000	6052000	a promise and a memo that was
6052000	6054000	supposed to go around to the company about
6054000	6056000	diversity in the workplace and all these types
6056000	6058000	of things that companies usually do when they're
6058000	6060000	panicked that a lawsuit might happen
6060000	6062000	and that the firm was supposed to update the policies
6062000	6064000	none of this ever happened according to the lawsuit
6064000	6066000	and Durant also claims
6066000	6068000	that he was the one who was offered counseling
6068000	6070000	which he said to that, they're making
6070000	6072000	out that I'm the one with the problem
6072000	6074000	apparently he has been out of work
6074000	6076000	suffering from depression for seven months
6076000	6078000	and he's now seeking damages due to this
6078000	6080000	but
6080000	6082000	I don't know, here's the weird
6082000	6084000	thing, and the thing that's kind of weird about
6084000	6086000	this is that Microsoft has kind of
6086000	6088000	gotten praise from the
6088000	6090000	human rights campaign foundation for
6090000	6092000	the way they treat their gay and lesbian
6092000	6094000	and bisexual workers before, so
6094000	6096000	is this a problem with
6096000	6098000	one particular office?
6098000	6100000	Is this a problem with
6100000	6102000	Lionhead? Is this a problem
6102000	6104000	with the employee?
6104000	6106000	There's two sides to every story, right?
6106000	6108000	Is there something else going on here?
6108000	6110000	I don't know, it's
6110000	6112000	hard to say, we're only kind of hearing one side
6112000	6114000	of it. They'd have to do a really
6114000	6116000	thorough investigation to get any kind of
6116000	6118000	actual
6118000	6120000	point out of that.
6120000	6122000	The part of it that's interesting is the part
6122000	6124000	that he's already been out of work for seven months
6124000	6126000	and if it's due to this
6126000	6128000	it's gotta be really bad. It's gotta be
6128000	6130000	really, really bad. But
6130000	6132000	I mean, and again, I don't know this guy,
6132000	6134000	I'm not gonna slander this guy, I don't know anything that's
6134000	6136000	going on here, but before, you know, and I think
6136000	6138000	a lot of people might read this and go, oh Rob's
6138000	6140000	gonna be pissed on the show because he's gay too,
6140000	6142000	he's gonna throw a fit over this. Not necessarily
6142000	6144000	because I also know
6144000	6146000	people that sometimes
6146000	6148000	like to be the victim. Oh yeah.
6148000	6150000	You know what I mean? And when I hear this
6150000	6152000	whole fact about he's been out of work for a long time
6152000	6154000	I start to go, you know, there could be
6154000	6156000	another side to this coin. I don't know.
6156000	6158000	I don't know the facts. I'm not him.
6158000	6160000	But I do know that there could be more
6160000	6162000	to this than meets the eye.
6162000	6164000	I would just hope to hell. Maybe
6164000	6166000	I'm just hopeful and maybe foolishly
6166000	6168000	so. I just, I'm hopeful to hell
6168000	6170000	that in this fucking year 2009
6170000	6172000	we would just get past
6172000	6174000	this stupid school
6174000	6176000	playground bullshit.
6176000	6178000	I know. Sadly we haven't.
6178000	6180000	Not completely. Maybe I'm just
6180000	6182000	spoiled because I happen to work in a place
6182000	6184000	where this shit doesn't happen.
6184000	6186000	And I'm fairly confident
6186000	6188000	and almost 100% confident this kind of shit
6188000	6190000	would not happen.
6190000	6192000	So when I read these stories I'm just like
6192000	6194000	really? Really?
6194000	6196000	Fagboy? In an email?
6196000	6198000	Really? Someone's that dumb
6198000	6200000	to do something like that that can be
6200000	6202000	traced? Really?
6202000	6204000	I don't get it.
6204000	6206000	And Goldanthro in chat
6206000	6208000	says not pissed, eh Rob?
6208000	6210000	I don't know. Like if this story is true
6210000	6212000	fuck yeah I'm pissed. This is
6212000	6214000	inexcusable. This is stupid.
6214000	6216000	But
6216000	6218000	you know there's two sides to every story.
6218000	6220000	Just because the guy filed the lawsuit
6220000	6222000	doesn't necessarily mean it's 100%
6222000	6224000	true. I think that's one thing we have to remember.
6224000	6226000	Right? So I don't want to lose my shit
6226000	6228000	and start saying oh we should boycott
6228000	6230000	Lionhead and we should boycott all these games.
6230000	6232000	I don't know. Now if
6232000	6234000	it comes out through due process
6234000	6236000	and in the court of law that yeah
6236000	6238000	Lionhead did do something wrong
6238000	6240000	then I will lose my shit and prepare to say
6240000	6242000	some choice things about the company.
6242000	6244000	But at this stage it's a little early to tell, correct?
6244000	6246000	I agree.
6246000	6248000	Regardless, very disappointing
6248000	6250000	that this lawsuit is filed one way or
6250000	6252000	the other. So
6252000	6254000	of course you knew after a story like
6254000	6274000	this could only come a segment of ours we love.
6274000	6276000	Really my F.U. of the week
6276000	6278000	is just
6278000	6280000	people who
6280000	6282000	don't want to look at the facts
6282000	6284000	and want to use their own version.
6284000	6286000	It really, okay.
6286000	6288000	Only a few people will really get
6288000	6290000	the root of this but it goes towards
6290000	6292000	something that I
6292000	6294000	have noticed that applies to politics,
6294000	6296000	religion, and fandom.
6296000	6298000	Don't
6298000	6300000	twist things
6300000	6302000	into your version
6302000	6304000	of what they should be just to justify
6304000	6306000	what you, you know, believe.
6306000	6308000	At least admit fact.
6308000	6310000	If it's what you believe
6310000	6312000	then that's what you believe but at least
6312000	6314000	accept reality.
6314000	6316000	That's all.
6316000	6318000	And also to
6318000	6320000	being super exhausted
6320000	6322000	all day yesterday and being sick from it.
6322000	6324000	Then.
6324000	6326000	I personally
6326000	6328000	do not really have many F.U.s of the week.
6328000	6330000	Things have been going fine so I'll keep an F.U. to my incessant
6330000	6332000	napping habit. I nap a lot
6332000	6334000	and it's like screwing up my sleep schedule
6334000	6336000	royally. So I need to stop
6336000	6338000	that. An F.U. to lack of motivation
6338000	6340000	into my exercise program as well.
6340000	6342000	I need to get back on that.
6342000	6344000	Um, F.U. to allergies because my nose
6344000	6346000	has been all stuffed up the last few days.
6346000	6348000	It's all windy over here.
6348000	6350000	That's it.
6350000	6352000	Alright.
6352000	6354000	That's gonna do it for the F.U.s of the week.
6354000	6356000	Let's get back to some gaming news.
6356000	6358000	Dark Sakura, speaking of Lionhead
6358000	6360000	Studios.
6360000	6362000	Well.
6362000	6364000	I
6364000	6366000	am happy because I am
6366000	6368000	still sort of playing this game when I can.
6368000	6370000	But there is actually supposed
6370000	6372000	to be new downloadable content
6372000	6374000	available for Fable 2.
6374000	6376000	And that is exciting.
6376000	6378000	They're still paying attention to us.
6378000	6380000	People who are still playing it.
6380000	6382000	It's supposed to be
6382000	6384000	coming out in
6384000	6386000	the spring. So I'm supposing early
6386000	6388000	spring.
6388000	6390000	But there's
6390000	6392000	nothing, I think not a whole
6392000	6394000	lot that I'm seeing about what exactly
6394000	6396000	it is. They're just revealing
6396000	6398000	they're going to be revealing information
6398000	6400000	on it.
6400000	6402000	But they say that it's supposed
6402000	6404000	to answer questions if you've been
6404000	6406000	a fan of the whole series.
6406000	6408000	And apparently
6408000	6410000	it's supposed to be really dramatic. So I don't
6410000	6412000	know.
6412000	6414000	But there actually
6414000	6416000	though has been a statement by
6416000	6418000	Jonathan Ross
6418000	6420000	that he was offered a voice role
6420000	6422000	in Fable 3.
6422000	6424000	So maybe there's
6424000	6426000	a connection there?
6426000	6428000	Maybe there's something leading up into the next
6428000	6430000	game.
6430000	6432000	Great. Fable 3.
6432000	6434000	Well I don't think that's going to be any surprise.
6434000	6436000	It would be exactly the same as Fable 1 and 2.
6436000	6438000	Well 2 had a lot of differences
6438000	6440000	from 1 I thought. I thought they were very different.
6440000	6442000	Jonathan Ross
6442000	6444000	is pretty cool.
6444000	6446000	I don't know.
6446000	6448000	That's what I say about
6448000	6450000	that.
6450000	6452000	Well something not Fable
6452000	6454000	related. But kind of cool.
6454000	6456000	I mean this is one of the first games I've played
6456000	6458000	on my old
6458000	6460000	386 computer. This was the first
6460000	6462000	first person shooter
6462000	6464000	game I've seen.
6464000	6466000	Was it
6466000	6468000	Wolfenstein 3D
6468000	6470000	being released on
6470000	6472000	the iPhone?
6472000	6474000	How cool is that?
6474000	6476000	And
6476000	6478000	possibly
6478000	6480000	soon enough, Doom will be
6480000	6482000	released as well.
6482000	6484000	But hey, Wolfenstein 3D
6484000	6486000	man, that takes me back. One of the first games I
6486000	6488000	actually edited levels for using their
6488000	6490000	I don't know if they released the level editor
6490000	6492000	or if it was one someone else made.
6492000	6494000	But pretty awesome.
6494000	6496000	And you can actually play it now on the iPhone.
6496000	6498000	And
6498000	6500000	damn I can imagine that would probably run
6500000	6502000	pretty well since the game is ancient.
6502000	6504000	But
6504000	6506000	pretty cool.
6506000	6508000	You can speculate what they're saying in German.
6508000	6510000	Yeah.
6510000	6512000	And I guess it's free.
6512000	6514000	I'm not sure if this is like a free version of the game
6514000	6516000	or if they're going to do like a
6516000	6518000	you know
6518000	6520000	Oh it is free. I guess it's actually
6520000	6522000	part of an open source project.
6522000	6524000	So check it out. Free.
6524000	6526000	Hey, that's the best price ever.
6526000	6528000	For free.
6528000	6530000	Well
6530000	6532000	there's other games coming to the iPhone that aren't
6532000	6534000	free but they're very very nostalgic
6534000	6536000	nonetheless. Mega Man 2
6536000	6538000	is out right
6538000	6540000	now. It's not coming soon. It's already out
6540000	6542000	on the iTunes app store.
6542000	6544000	It's interesting though the way it controls
6544000	6546000	because since the iPhone doesn't really have any
6546000	6548000	controls on it which you would think
6548000	6550000	they're going to release something eventually.
6550000	6552000	They can just plug into the bottom of the iPhone and
6552000	6554000	voila instant gamepad. I don't know.
6554000	6556000	But right now you use a little joystick
6556000	6558000	that's on the bottom that is like kind of
6558000	6560000	a touch and then two buttons. So it's like a virtual
6560000	6562000	joystick using the touch screen.
6562000	6564000	But yeah it's Mega Man 2.
6564000	6566000	But I would think
6566000	6568000	it's going to be difficult to control because of the
6568000	6570000	fact it's kind of those weird buttons and touch
6570000	6572000	but hey there's going to be some nostalgic
6572000	6574000	freaking people that are very excited about this game anyway.
6574000	6576000	Do you think you could still
6576000	6578000	beat the first boss in Wily's Castle without looking
6578000	6580000	Dark Soccer on the iPhone? Oh heck no.
6580000	6582000	I can't even do it anymore on the Nintendo.
6582000	6584000	Seriously I'm
6584000	6586000	so out of practice on that game.
6586000	6588000	Yeah that would be tough.
6588000	6590000	Plus I'd be worried I'd get a phone call in the middle of it
6590000	6592000	and then the whole thing is just screwed up.
6592000	6594000	You know right as I'm starting to jump over a pit or something.
6594000	6596000	Seriously? Then besides that
6596000	6598000	I can just break out my Nintendo.
6598000	6600000	TigerKlonChat wants to point out
6600000	6602000	Loki, those games you were talking about before are
6602000	6604000	$4.99 in the App Store, not free. Maybe there's a free
6604000	6606000	version or something. Well yeah that's what I was
6606000	6608000	wondering. I was like free? But it said it was part of an
6608000	6610000	open source project and it said it was released for free
6610000	6612000	but I had my doubts.
6612000	6614000	Especially with Wolfenstein 3D. It wouldn't give
6614000	6616000	us something like that away for free.
6616000	6618000	And of course our chatters are already talking about
6618000	6620000	the Mega Man 2 thing
6620000	6622000	on the iPhone and X-Link says
6622000	6624000	do not buy Mega Man 2 it is hard to control.
6624000	6626000	AcidicVampire says IGN gave
6626000	6628000	the iPhone Mega Man 2 a 1 out of 10
6628000	6630000	and it's really awful to control. Not that I would
6630000	6632000	believe everything that IGN says but in this
6632000	6634000	case I would probably believe it.
6634000	6636000	The game probably does stink. I can totally see how it would be hard to
6636000	6638000	control. Especially given
6638000	6640000	the way that it's set up.
6640000	6642000	Is there a lefty mode in it?
6642000	6644000	I saw the joystick thing.
6644000	6646000	I don't know. That's a good question.
6646000	6648000	No.
6648000	6650000	It wouldn't work.
6650000	6652000	Yeah I don't think
6652000	6654000	that game is going to be any fun to play on the iPhone
6654000	6656000	at all but hey if you're that nostalgic and you
6656000	6658000	need it in your pocket everywhere you go
6658000	6660000	go for it.
6660000	6662000	Or just get like a Game Boy
6662000	6664000	or something I don't know.
6664000	6666000	Emulate the bitch on the PSP.
6666000	6668000	Actually I'll tell you what Dan and I did
6668000	6670000	whenever we won our Mega Man 2 fix.
6670000	6672000	We actually ordered a handheld
6672000	6674000	Nintendo.
6674000	6676000	That they make.
6676000	6678000	And they're like 70 bucks.
6678000	6680000	But we ordered one a while back. I'm waiting for it to arrive.
6680000	6682000	They're supposed to be
6682000	6684000	pretty cool.
6684000	6686000	Well how about something that's a little bit
6686000	6688000	happier. How about
6688000	6690000	some Guitar Hero
6690000	6692000	World Tour information.
6692000	6694000	Actually very specifically how about
6694000	6696000	Queen
6696000	6698000	on Guitar Hero World Tour.
6698000	6700000	There's actually
6700000	6702000	going to be a song pack that has
6702000	6704000	celebrity fat bottom girls
6704000	6706000	and we are the champions for
6706000	6708000	440 points
6708000	6710000	for the pack
6710000	6712000	or you can buy each one for
6712000	6714000	160.
6714000	6716000	And they're going to be 549 on
6716000	6718000	PlayStation Network.
6718000	6720000	You actually will be able
6720000	6722000	to get them on Wii as well
6722000	6724000	for 200 Wii points.
6724000	6726000	And then there's
6726000	6728000	supposed to be a
6728000	6730000	new recording of the James Bond theme
6730000	6732000	that's supposed to be available
6732000	6734000	coming up soon.
6734000	6736000	I saw
6736000	6738000	something on YouTube. I don't know if it was that
6738000	6740000	exact one. I thought it was one that someone made
6740000	6742000	how you can make your custom tracks
6742000	6744000	or whatever.
6744000	6746000	And it was pretty awesome.
6746000	6748000	So hopefully it's the same one.
6748000	6750000	That was a pretty awesome version of the Bond theme.
6750000	6752000	Lots of liberties taken
6752000	6754000	and it looked pretty hard.
6754000	6756000	Not
6756000	6758000	quite as kick ass on
6758000	6760000	the rock band.
6760000	6762000	We get some interesting
6762000	6764000	things. Including
6764000	6766000	Spongebob Squarepants music.
6766000	6768000	Who'd have thought we'd see that
6768000	6770000	in a rock band.
6770000	6772000	But apparently we are.
6772000	6774000	The Spongebob Squarepants pack
6774000	6776000	is actually going to be
6776000	6778000	relatively cheap. It's going to be
6778000	6780000	99 cents per song or 80
6780000	6782000	Microsoft points.
6782000	6784000	Those include
6784000	6786000	I Can't Keep My Eyes Off You, Best
6786000	6788000	Day Ever, and Where's Gary.
6788000	6790000	And then other than that
6790000	6792000	Journey is going to be
6792000	6794000	getting a song on there with Don't Stop Believin'.
6794000	6796000	And
6796000	6798000	I guess also joining
6798000	6800000	that would be Pat Benatar's Heartbreaker.
6800000	6802000	And that's
6802000	6804000	coming as well.
6804000	6806000	And then some other stuff.
6806000	6808000	Glass Vegas with
6808000	6810000	Geraldine and Come On Come On by
6810000	6812000	Von Bondis.
6812000	6814000	Not Bondis.
6814000	6816000	And that's pretty
6816000	6818000	much it for this week though.
6818000	6820000	Spongebob, that's weird.
6820000	6822000	Yeah, but Journey. Freakin' Journey's coming
6822000	6824000	out. So who cares? That's amazing.
6824000	6826000	They could have put a better song in there though.
6826000	6828000	You know what, I actually agree. I think Don't Stop Believin'
6828000	6830000	is way too cliche. And especially for a rock band.
6830000	6832000	You should have put it by
6832000	6834000	Wheel in the Sky. Yeah, Wheel in the Sky
6834000	6836000	would be awesome. But you know,
6836000	6838000	whatever. I'll take what I can get. I mean,
6838000	6840000	who isn't going to want to bust out with Don't Stop
6840000	6842000	Believin' at a party, right? I just see that one as being way too easy
6842000	6844000	even on Expert. Yeah, probably.
6844000	6846000	Who knows. Anyhow,
6846000	6848000	this is the part of the show where we like to open up the old
6848000	6850000	mailbag and read some of your emails
6850000	6852000	that you send to us every week at Mailbag at
6852000	6854000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com. So let's get into it.
6860000	6862000	First email comes from J-Rod.
6862000	6864000	Hey OLR crew, I'm emailing
6864000	6866000	to try to get your stance on this guitar hero versus
6866000	6868000	rock band war people are in.
6868000	6870000	I still don't see any differences between rock bands
6870000	6872000	that download content and a guitar hero disc.
6872000	6874000	It's both companies
6874000	6876000	putting out new content to the player.
6876000	6878000	I don't even own guitar hero
6878000	6880000	but I at least think it's a good idea to let
6880000	6882000	people without an internet connection actually be able
6882000	6884000	to play new songs. Look at rock band
6884000	6886000	on the Wii. Would you seriously
6886000	6888000	be happy owning that when
6888000	6890000	you see what's on the other platforms?
6890000	6892000	Then people complain, well,
6892000	6894000	I only want three of the songs. I don't want to pay
6894000	6896000	$50 for the whole game.
6896000	6898000	But then don't complain at all when they have to
6898000	6900000	buy a new Wii track pack plus
6900000	6902000	um, I'm sorry
6902000	6904000	Wii track pack for
6904000	6906000	a few songs just because
6906000	6908000	it's the rock band title.
6908000	6910000	People say Activision is running
6910000	6912000	the series into the ground but putting out
6912000	6914000	more content but isn't rock band doing the
6914000	6916000	same thing just not with a physical
6916000	6918000	disc? I don't see
6918000	6920000	how a disc makes any amount of difference
6920000	6922000	in the equation when it's still
6922000	6924000	more songs and more content coming
6924000	6926000	out by both companies. Again
6926000	6928000	nobody made such a fuss
6928000	6930000	with the ACDC pack or with the Wii track
6930000	6932000	packs the way they do with Activision.
6932000	6934000	Um, the only one I would
6934000	6936000	say is the ACDC pack because that wasn't
6936000	6938000	available online but all the rock band
6938000	6940000	track packs are just for people that don't have
6940000	6942000	internet connections and some random
6942000	6944000	stuff that's available for download content.
6944000	6946000	You do not need to buy it. It's not
6946000	6948000	its own, you know, I mean it can be its own
6948000	6950000	game which is fine but
6950000	6952000	it's not basically
6952000	6954000	you know, it's not required. It's not like
6954000	6956000	a Guitar Hero Metallica or something like that
6956000	6958000	where you're only going to be able to get those tracks
6958000	6960000	through that disc version. So I don't
6960000	6962000	really see the harm in releasing that because it
6962000	6964000	gives people an option that don't have the
6964000	6966000	internet connection to be able to
6966000	6968000	actually download some of these tracks.
6968000	6970000	And it's completely optional. Now the ACDC thing
6970000	6972000	yeah that's no excuse. That
6972000	6974000	you did have to get through that and that was
6974000	6976000	also an exclusive through Walmart so
6976000	6978000	And it was one band.
6978000	6980000	And frankly a band I'm
6980000	6982000	not interested in. Shock and awe I know
6982000	6984000	they're a great rock band but just not my
6984000	6986000	type of thing. But look at like
6986000	6988000	I was
6988000	6990000	going to say look at the stuff that they're doing
6990000	6992000	though with Guitar Hero right
6992000	6994000	now. They've got like Guitar Hero Metallica
6994000	6996000	they've got Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out
6996000	6998000	Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero
6998000	7000000	greatest hits. All stuff
7000000	7002000	that's not necessarily available on
7002000	7004000	their service and granted greatest hits are
7004000	7006000	some of the older songs that were in the older games
7006000	7008000	but I mean they could easily
7008000	7010000	release that as you know download content
7010000	7012000	for world tour. They don't need to have
7012000	7014000	it's own game and really it's not
7014000	7016000	adding anything it's just a reskinned world tour
7016000	7018000	just you know
7018000	7020000	now with whatever band
7020000	7022000	and I think it's kind of lame
7022000	7024000	that they don't even have like a track import
7024000	7026000	function that they do with like rock band.
7026000	7028000	I do know of people
7028000	7030000	who actually
7030000	7032000	do not use live at
7032000	7034000	all who
7034000	7036000	don't you know bother
7036000	7038000	with it who don't play online
7038000	7040000	so for them Guitar Hero actually is a better
7040000	7042000	option really.
7042000	7044000	But to finish out the email
7044000	7046000	cause he actually did go on with a little
7046000	7048000	bit more. In the end if you
7048000	7050000	ask me it all comes down to people crying about
7050000	7052000	switching discs. Are you kidding me
7052000	7054000	I own both rock band games and don't have
7054000	7056000	rock band 2 imported because it takes me
7056000	7058000	6 seconds to switch a disc.
7058000	7060000	I play a few songs I want on one game
7060000	7062000	then play a few songs I want on another game
7062000	7064000	and some download content. If you have friends
7064000	7066000	over in the whole place just shuts down
7066000	7068000	because you have to switch a disc
7068000	7070000	tell them to take their ADHD medication
7070000	7072000	before they come over next time. And that's the thing
7072000	7074000	with rock band you can import that stuff so you don't have
7074000	7076000	to switch discs it's all
7076000	7078000	you know you can dump it to your hard drive. He completely has the point of what he just
7078000	7080000	said. Well
7080000	7082000	the whole I don't know. The whole point of what he just
7082000	7084000	said is that it takes 6 seconds to change a disc.
7084000	7086000	Yeah well and here's the thing
7086000	7088000	it's all optional no one's forcing you
7088000	7090000	to buy Guitar Hero or
7090000	7092000	Rock Band so if you want it you want
7092000	7094000	it cool if you don't want it then don't buy
7094000	7096000	it. But don't feel that you're forced to actually
7096000	7098000	buy this stuff cause you know
7098000	7100000	as soon as you start buying every single release
7100000	7102000	it comes out just because you want to
7102000	7104000	be able to you know have
7104000	7106000	you want to support them so that they release
7106000	7108000	you know whatever band you're waiting for or whatever
7108000	7110000	I think that's a horrible reason to do it.
7110000	7112000	Well to finish the
7112000	7114000	email cause there's still a little bit more on this
7114000	7116000	what happens when the Beatles game comes out
7116000	7118000	because I'm sure you won't be able to import that into your
7118000	7120000	library. Are people going to be bitching about that?
7120000	7122000	That's all.
7122000	7124000	Honestly I think it comes
7124000	7126000	down to personal preference. I think Rock Band
7126000	7128000	plays better than Guitar Hero
7128000	7130000	in fact I think Rock Band plays
7130000	7132000	a hell of a lot better than Guitar Hero
7132000	7134000	it just seems generally programmed
7134000	7136000	to be more responsive so I have a better time
7136000	7138000	playing that. And in defense
7138000	7140000	of importing your Rock Band
7140000	7142000	One tracks it actually if you
7142000	7144000	want to mix and match
7144000	7146000	bands from both modes especially
7146000	7148000	when you can create your own setlist
7148000	7150000	it actually
7150000	7152000	it gives you more freedom to
7152000	7154000	combine it the way that you want to.
7154000	7156000	But hey whatever sinks
7156000	7158000	your battleship. Well the thing
7158000	7160000	also with the importing on the Beatles
7160000	7162000	version I think that was a special deal
7162000	7164000	that they had with I don't know who owns it
7164000	7166000	I think it's Apple or something
7166000	7168000	Apple Music that you know they didn't
7168000	7170000	want it to be imported into Rock Band
7170000	7172000	and it's not technically a Rock Band game
7172000	7174000	it's just kind of like Rock Band presents
7174000	7176000	the Beatles it's their own game
7176000	7178000	it's their own kind of thing going on there
7178000	7180000	so that's
7180000	7182000	going to be kind of like an exception but if
7182000	7184000	no ever comes out there's a
7184000	7186000	Rock Band Metallica
7186000	7188000	or something like that then yeah
7188000	7190000	I'm pretty sure that we'll have
7190000	7192000	import
7192000	7194000	functionality and that kind of stuff and then
7194000	7196000	honestly I don't see them actually doing that I would see
7196000	7198000	them releasing it as like an album you can
7198000	7200000	download because I think that they
7200000	7202000	would get a lot more hits because a lot of people
7202000	7204000	well I don't like this song
7204000	7206000	I'm not going to buy Guitar
7206000	7208000	Hero greatest hits because it only has a couple
7208000	7210000	songs that I want on it well if you
7210000	7212000	could download those songs individually at least you sold
7212000	7214000	those two songs you know whereas someone
7214000	7216000	might just avoid the package altogether if they can't
7216000	7218000	separate them it's all about
7218000	7220000	choice as Microsoft would say
7222000	7224000	well
7224000	7226000	the next email is actually
7226000	7228000	a short one and I think this is addressed to Rob really
7228000	7230000	because I don't think either of us were really boycotting
7230000	7232000	and he pretty much already
7232000	7234000	answered it but I'm going to read it anyway that's fine
7234000	7236000	now that the boycott is over what
7236000	7238000	are you most anxious to try out if you haven't
7238000	7240000	already discussed it
7240000	7242000	Bit.Trip Beat was one I was really looking forward to
7242000	7244000	I also want to go back and check out
7244000	7246000	probably one of the Commodore 64 downloads
7246000	7248000	just because I want to see how well those came over
7248000	7250000	I'm still kind of holding out for Impossible
7250000	7252000	Mission I would like to be the one I would get
7252000	7254000	but I'm not opposed to going back and getting one of the other
7254000	7256000	Commodore 64 greats like Last Ninja
7256000	7258000	or Pitstop 2 even just because
7258000	7260000	I have memories with that one
7260000	7262000	as far as the WiiWare games I feel so far behind
7262000	7264000	on a lot of those I don't even really know where to begin
7264000	7266000	but
7266000	7268000	I know Bit.Trip Beat was one I was definitely looking
7268000	7270000	forward to personally as well as the Gradius
7270000	7272000	Rebirth which were the two I picked up right away
7272000	7274000	after my boycott was over
7274000	7276000	that's really it I might go
7276000	7278000	back and
7278000	7280000	thinking about maybe getting some obscure Neo Geo
7280000	7282000	games but I don't know I don't want to go too crazy with the
7282000	7284000	money spending either it's very
7284000	7286000	easy when you're not actually
7286000	7288000	giving away tangible
7288000	7290000	cash but you're hitting a button that
7290000	7292000	drains it out of your bank account you know what I mean
7292000	7294000	that's something you got to keep yourself in check with sometimes
7294000	7296000	I used to buy
7296000	7298000	like every single Xbox Live Arcade game that came
7298000	7300000	out and I really had to stop doing that because
7300000	7302000	some of them were crap
7302000	7304000	but yeah I got to watch
7304000	7306000	out with going too crazy
7306000	7308000	on the Wii but I'll buy good stuff as it comes out
7308000	7310000	as I notice it
7310000	7312000	there was another music game
7312000	7314000	that had come out that I want to go back and check out
7314000	7316000	that I missed and
7316000	7318000	I don't remember the name of it maybe somebody in chat
7318000	7320000	will speak up but I distinctly remember there was some other
7320000	7322000	type of beat game that had come out
7322000	7324000	previously on WiiWare that I wanted to check out
7324000	7326000	Last email
7326000	7328000	This is from Spazinator
7328000	7330000	Hi everyone
7330000	7332000	at OLR I have a few questions for you three
7332000	7334000	to mull over I'll try to keep
7334000	7336000	this email as short as possible seeing as most of the ones
7336000	7338000	I've sent were a bit on the long side
7338000	7340000	one regarding PSN's
7340000	7342000	high velocity bowling PS3's version of
7342000	7344000	Wii bowling have you folks noticed
7344000	7346000	any problems with the game? Gameplay
7346000	7348000	in and of itself
7348000	7350000	seems fine to me but I can see
7350000	7352000	how a lot of people may have a problem
7352000	7354000	with the game specifically the characters within the game
7354000	7356000	so the characters are basically stereotypes
7356000	7358000	ranging from Latinos to
7358000	7360000	70's Black Panther-esque
7360000	7362000	characters and even
7362000	7364000	a gay flight attendant
7364000	7366000	if it weren't for the stereotypes this would be a great game
7366000	7368000	but as I'm actually
7368000	7370000	embarrassed to say that
7370000	7372000	as is I'm actually
7372000	7374000	embarrassed to say that I have this
7374000	7376000	I don't even remotely resemble any of the stereotypes
7376000	7378000	yet I find myself offended for the people
7378000	7380000	that the stereotyping characters are
7380000	7382000	supposed to poke fun of what is your position
7382000	7384000	on this am I just overreacting
7384000	7386000	or is there some cause for
7386000	7388000	concern?
7390000	7392000	I have a quote I'd like to say
7392000	7394000	about this
7394000	7396000	don't be offended for other people
7396000	7398000	please I'm
7398000	7400000	going to quote one of my favorite comedians
7400000	7402000	Henry Cho for
7402000	7404000	using the term
7404000	7406000	oriental to refer to himself
7406000	7408000	and someone says oh no it's Asian American
7408000	7410000	he says well excuse me for offending myself
7410000	7412000	don't be offended
7412000	7414000	for other people if they're going to be offended
7414000	7416000	let them be offended you don't worry about it
7416000	7418000	if you're not doing the offense
7418000	7420000	then don't freaking worry about it that's what I have to say
7420000	7422000	you know you're
7422000	7424000	you didn't make the game
7424000	7426000	you bought it and you didn't know
7426000	7428000	that it was in there you know
7428000	7430000	just
7430000	7432000	roll with the punches fucking deal with it
7432000	7434000	it's there it's you know
7434000	7436000	I personally I crack
7436000	7438000	up as hell at redneck
7438000	7440000	stereotypes seriously and I
7440000	7442000	can say that's all my family
7442000	7444000	you know I know that not everyone from Alabama
7444000	7446000	is stupid and inbred but
7446000	7448000	I still laugh at Larry the cable guy
7448000	7450000	cause that's a parody
7450000	7452000	you know I
7452000	7454000	I don't see what the big deal is his name isn't
7454000	7456000	Larry and he's not really a cable guy exactly
7456000	7458000	it's parody
7458000	7460000	perpetuating a stereotype for satire
7460000	7462000	uh
7462000	7464000	I haven't played the game I don't really
7464000	7466000	want to make a comment on something I haven't really seen
7466000	7468000	first hand but it doesn't sound like it's
7468000	7470000	as long as it's there's a line
7470000	7472000	there's a real fine line a real
7472000	7474000	fine line between poking fun
7474000	7476000	and maliciously
7476000	7478000	you know hurting
7478000	7480000	people and I doubt this game is trying to maliciously
7480000	7482000	hurt people if that makes sense
7482000	7484000	um but I don't know I'd have
7484000	7486000	to see it it's a bully title how
7486000	7488000	could it be malicious unless
7488000	7490000	it's just over the top
7490000	7492000	with you know
7492000	7494000	if the characters just look that way
7494000	7496000	and may have a little bit of dialogue that's just
7496000	7498000	that's just supposed to be fun
7498000	7500000	you know
7500000	7502000	people need to really I think
7502000	7504000	just toughen up and get the hell over it
7504000	7506000	and you I
7506000	7508000	this is my opinion again I'm not telling you what to believe
7508000	7510000	but I don't think
7510000	7512000	that one person has the right
7512000	7514000	to be offended on behalf
7514000	7516000	of another person especially
7516000	7518000	if there's a chance that they're not offended
7518000	7520000	that's just
7520000	7522000	me
7522000	7524000	I doubt I would be offended
7524000	7526000	by the little gay flight attendant or whatever
7526000	7528000	in this game this is like every single
7528000	7530000	game has those kind of stereotype
7530000	7532000	characters because people can identify
7532000	7534000	with stereotype characters you know
7534000	7536000	um they're in
7536000	7538000	movies I mean
7538000	7540000	how many stereotype movies are
7540000	7542000	out there I mean of just like
7542000	7544000	all sorts of stuff it's
7544000	7546000	just it's part of everyday life
7546000	7548000	in the media unfortunately even in Austin
7548000	7550000	Powers we had Foxy Cleopatra
7550000	7552000	and that was just a nod back to the
7552000	7554000	70s movies you know like
7554000	7556000	the what's her name Pam Greer
7556000	7558000	you know
7558000	7560000	Bobby in chat says I'm offended on dark
7560000	7562000	soccer's behalf about offended people
7562000	7564000	they can
7564000	7566000	bite my ass
7566000	7568000	chew on that for a bit
7568000	7570000	seriously
7570000	7572000	68 makes an interesting comment I don't know how far we want
7572000	7574000	to go with this but I'm going to open
7574000	7576000	a whole can of worms here we go
7576000	7578000	68 says by that same token
7578000	7580000	everyone who isn't not
7580000	7582000	straight shouldn't have voted no
7582000	7584000	on prop 8
7584000	7586000	or should I don't know he used bad
7586000	7588000	grammar here should have that's
7588000	7590000	not a matter of being offended
7590000	7592000	that's a matter of a human rights issue that's
7592000	7594000	different your
7594000	7596000	that's apples and oranges right there
7596000	7598000	it's a matter of
7598000	7600000	taking something personally
7600000	7602000	that doesn't apply to you
7602000	7604000	I mean if we were really you know
7604000	7606000	this is something
7606000	7608000	that was supposed to supposedly
7608000	7610000	affect the entire
7610000	7612000	population of California
7612000	7614000	you've got
7614000	7616000	it would basically create new
7616000	7618000	taxation it would change
7618000	7620000	economic status
7620000	7622000	it was a very big
7622000	7624000	thing it's a big human rights issue
7624000	7626000	there's a difference though between
7626000	7628000	like I know people
7628000	7630000	who
7630000	7632000	may not particularly agree
7632000	7634000	you know with the lifestyle
7634000	7636000	who voted no on prop 8
7636000	7638000	just because it was
7638000	7640000	a matter of human rights
7640000	7642000	I don't know how far I want to go with this but I can just
7642000	7644000	say you know it's like
7644000	7646000	you know obviously the issue was very important to me and the
7646000	7648000	result was very very very very very disappointing and
7648000	7650000	I even had some people tell me that you know
7650000	7652000	they voted yes on it like
7652000	7654000	I don't know they felt the need to confess they
7654000	7656000	they voted yes on it because
7656000	7658000	church or god told them to
7658000	7660000	and it's so it's so frustrating because
7660000	7662000	it's like think for yourself
7662000	7664000	how would you like it if it was you
7664000	7666000	it's not a choice alright
7666000	7668000	god anyway sorry
7668000	7670000	I could go on all day about it
7670000	7672000	different show whole nother Oprah
7672000	7674000	I will go ahead and plug my blog
7674000	7676000	if anyone wants to know my
7676000	7678000	opinion on this I posted the
7678000	7680000	blog on darksacroix.com
7680000	7682000	and please don't
7682000	7684000	spam it I don't care
7684000	7686000	um so how about there's the email
7686000	7688000	yes please okay
7688000	7690000	currently I have a relatively cheap
7690000	7692000	Sony Bravia surround system
7692000	7694000	which I got from Target last year
7694000	7696000	for the most part it serves its purpose and sounds
7696000	7698000	good but there is one problem I've noticed
7698000	7700000	unless I'm playing a DVD
7700000	7702000	it's um and it's built
7702000	7704000	in DVD player I won't get surround sound
7704000	7706000	as is in terms of input
7706000	7708000	the system has typical red white RCA
7708000	7710000	jacks um mini plug input
7710000	7712000	like what you'd see on headphones
7712000	7714000	some kind of jack I'm unfamiliar with
7714000	7716000	all I know is that it's the one
7716000	7718000	iPods use for outputs
7718000	7720000	I guess um in essence
7720000	7722000	is there a way to trick my surround
7722000	7724000	system to accept stuff
7724000	7726000	like my PS3 or
7726000	7728000	360 surround which supports
7728000	7730000	sound output and actually hear it in my surround
7730000	7732000	sound and basically in my SOL
7732000	7734000	any info on this will help a lot
7734000	7736000	thanks um my recommendation
7736000	7738000	is um
7738000	7740000	to uh go on eBay and look
7740000	7742000	for a hardened Karman receiver and just
7742000	7744000	use your speakers and use that
7744000	7746000	it sounds like your receiver doesn't actually
7746000	7748000	have surround sound maybe Prologic
7748000	7750000	um which would be why you
7750000	7752000	don't have any actual digital or analog
7752000	7754000	um you know
7754000	7756000	surround sound inputs
7756000	7758000	usually you would have an optical in
7758000	7760000	um which you might see on the back of your
7760000	7762000	PS3 or your Xbox
7762000	7764000	360 on like the component cable and stuff like that
7764000	7766000	or um
7766000	7768000	sometimes a coax as
7768000	7770000	well which would be kind of like your RCA
7770000	7772000	plugs but they're orange
7772000	7774000	so um
7774000	7776000	I don't know
7776000	7778000	if you don't have either one of those you're probably not gonna
7778000	7780000	really get true surround sound unless they
7780000	7782000	have some sort of surround sound mode in it and
7782000	7784000	it's gonna have to be Prologic which you're just
7784000	7786000	gonna hook up through your um standard
7786000	7788000	RCA red and white my initial thought
7788000	7790000	with this was anytime you
7790000	7792000	use a converter you're gonna lose some sound quality
7792000	7794000	right you know so
7794000	7796000	isn't that part of the problem too
7796000	7798000	no it's just that he doesn't have an actual way
7798000	7800000	to send the 51 signal
7800000	7802000	over to his um system
7802000	7804000	it's like my old
7804000	7806000	tech support now suddenly look out
7806000	7808000	twit it's like I had a was it
7808000	7810000	I had an old system
7810000	7812000	that looked like it was you know 51
7812000	7814000	it had the surround sound speakers it had a center
7814000	7816000	channel and you know the left
7816000	7818000	and right and the two rears and stuff
7818000	7820000	um but it was not surround sound it was just
7820000	7822000	Prologic because there was no actual
7822000	7824000	surround it did no surround
7824000	7826000	sound processing uh tip from
7826000	7828000	Tigerclaw here in chat the surround receiver
7828000	7830000	must have optical inputs to plug the PS3
7830000	7832000	or 360 into it my receiver
7832000	7834000	has one optical input and I have the 360
7834000	7836000	connect to it and it's outputting 5.1 surround in the
7836000	7838000	games
7838000	7840000	act theft is calling this call for help
7840000	7842000	olr edition
7842000	7844000	nice um
7844000	7846000	I

7848000	7850000	you can find a good used
7850000	7852000	card and receiver for not that
7852000	7854000	expensive
7854000	7856000	the new ones 700 bucks
7856000	7858000	each old ones anywhere between
7858000	7860000	150 to 300 bucks

7862000	7864000	they're fantastic have you tried
7864000	7866000	rebooting your router

7868000	7870000	you turn it off
7870000	7872000	now wait a few seconds
7872000	7874000	and turn it back on no
7874000	7876000	seriously I watched the last
7876000	7878000	episode of Supernatural where they were
7878000	7880000	sort of put into alternate lives and I just the whole
7880000	7882000	tech support thing made me twitch because
7882000	7884000	I've heard all this before and it was
7884000	7886000	anyway I would I love whenever
7886000	7888000	I call Comcast to say the cables out and that's the first
7888000	7890000	thing they tell me to do I'll be like okay
7890000	7892000	okay I did it still nothing
7892000	7894000	and I didn't do a damn thing I'm just
7894000	7896000	just sitting there going oh this
7896000	7898000	still doesn't work what I do is
7898000	7900000	I I call I
7900000	7902000	I say okay please allow me to say
7902000	7904000	before we begin this discussion
7904000	7906000	yes I have reset my modem I've
7906000	7908000	reset my router I have done a repair
7908000	7910000	on the system and I've gone through all my network settings
7910000	7912000	it is not on my end
7912000	7914000	okay we'll ping it from here
7914000	7916000	that's always what happens
7916000	7918000	can you try opening the call
7918000	7920000	can you do a ping
7920000	7922000	I don't know anyway forget it let's move on
7922000	7924000	enough tech OLR
7924000	7926000	although I do have something
7926000	7928000	to add but I'll do it in last minute stories
7928000	7930000	this may be cool
7930000	7932000	Taito
7932000	7934000	guess what Taito is doing
7934000	7936000	they are still doing
7936000	7938000	more first person shooters in the
7938000	7940000	arcades you know
7940000	7942000	they did the half life 2 survivor
7942000	7944000	and now they've got one called
7944000	7946000	cyber driver which is
7946000	7948000	a take on
7948000	7950000	another first
7950000	7952000	person shooter game but it's supposed to have five on
7952000	7954000	five networked play and a different
7954000	7956000	game system so you can see
7956000	7958000	your battle damage in game
7958000	7960000	so it's supposed to be pretty
7960000	7962000	the screen capture looks pretty cool
7962000	7964000	but I'm like meh
7964000	7966000	because first person shooter
7966000	7968000	is high boring
7968000	7970000	unless they're call of duty
7972000	7974000	but it could be cool
7974000	7976000	I know
7978000	7980000	well
7980000	7982000	something else that's
7982000	7984000	interesting
7984000	7986000	this kind of goes back
7986000	7988000	to all this
7988000	7990000	stuff we've been talking about alternate services
7990000	7992000	that are going to be not necessarily competing with
7992000	7994000	consoles but
7994000	7996000	are
7996000	7998000	well level 5
7998000	8000000	from the many games
8000000	8002000	that they have put out
8002000	8004000	has announced a new
8004000	8006000	digital distribution service that will be launched
8006000	8008000	in japan in june 1st
8008000	8010000	and it's called
8010000	8012000	roid
8012000	8014000	like roid rage
8014000	8016000	but what's interesting though is
8016000	8018000	one of the first games that they're putting out
8018000	8020000	looks like earthbound
8020000	8022000	not necessarily earthbound
8022000	8024000	might be part of earthbound
8024000	8026000	but looks like earthbound
8026000	8028000	how exactly does the game
8028000	8030000	look like earthbound is it just like
8030000	8032000	sprite based modern
8032000	8034000	you know like set in kind of
8034000	8036000	city type thing looks
8036000	8038000	very earthbound-esque like the sprites
8038000	8040000	look very similar and they're wondering
8040000	8042000	could it be an earthbound game
8042000	8044000	like maybe an earthbound 4 or something like that
8044000	8046000	who knows
8048000	8050000	well
8050000	8052000	interesting I guess we'll see maybe this is something
8052000	8054000	we'll get more details at in a few months
8054000	8056000	and roid for those who may not have heard of it
8056000	8058000	is actually kind of like
8058000	8060000	a little bit like that zebo
8060000	8062000	thing that we were talking about earlier
8062000	8064000	it's its own platform
8064000	8066000	actually looks like one of those
8066000	8068000	the imac ones that they have
8068000	8070000	the little compact ones
8070000	8072000	I don't know it's interesting
8072000	8074000	it's cute
8074000	8076000	and I really dig the font
8078000	8080000	that's kind of interesting when the first thing you notice
8080000	8082000	about a game is the font
8082000	8084000	no the game the little
8084000	8086000	disc thing no I'm just messing
8086000	8088000	it's cute
8088000	8090000	I looked at the screenshots it did look a little bit
8090000	8092000	cute so
8092000	8094000	alright anyhow one more story for you guys
8094000	8096000	then we're going to open up the skype line
8096000	8098000	and it has to do with
8098000	8100000	other rpg series
8100000	8102000	full of fanboy wank we've talked about earthbound
8102000	8104000	a couple times tonight but we have yet to
8104000	8106000	address the wank that is final fantasy 7
8106000	8108000	and of course
8108000	8110000	how many final fantasy 7 fanboys
8110000	8112000	did not get the chance to fap to
8112000	8114000	advent children well advent children complete
8114000	8116000	is apparently the
8116000	8118000	final end of the
8118000	8120000	advent children saga meaning that there
8120000	8122000	is no more special
8122000	8124000	editions or directors cuts or you know
8124000	8126000	hidden scenes or any of that advent children
8126000	8128000	complete is the end of the line
8128000	8130000	which by the way did I not also read somewhere
8130000	8132000	this week that they did confirm this for the US in June
8132000	8134000	I want to say yeah but not the cool
8134000	8136000	version with the final fantasy 13
8136000	8138000	demo don't
8138000	8140000	but if you want if you're willing to
8140000	8142000	settle for the one without it or don't want to deal with the
8142000	8144000	import or what have you you can at least get it there in June
8144000	8146000	yes I'm not willing to settle for that so
8146000	8148000	import that bitch
8148000	8150000	however here's the thing
8150000	8152000	final fantasy 7 however as a whole
8152000	8154000	not done
8154000	8156000	Nomura has actually come out and said there is
8156000	8158000	still ideas for the next
8158000	8160000	product in the compilation
8160000	8162000	of course why don't you just do the final
8162000	8164000	fantasy 7 remake and then everybody will
8164000	8166000	be the next one coming
8166000	8168000	do you think
8168000	8170000	you think for real I think that final fantasy
8170000	8172000	7 remake is just something that will all
8172000	8174000	only live on in that singular tech
8174000	8176000	demo and in fanboy wank fantasies
8176000	8178000	I think final fantasy 7 will be
8178000	8180000	released on Playstation Network around the time
8180000	8182000	final fantasy 13 shows up especially
8182000	8184000	with the other final fantasies being confirmed for
8184000	8186000	the virtual console I think that's just a matter
8186000	8188000	of time and there'll be
8188000	8190000	plenty of wank and new wank
8190000	8192000	as more people discover the series for the first
8192000	8194000	time
8194000	8196000	but I don't think
8196000	8198000	that final fantasy 7 remake is gonna
8198000	8200000	happen but I'll tell you what all they
8200000	8202000	would have to do is add like
8202000	8204000	tiny little things to
8204000	8206000	final fantasy 7 when they re-release on
8206000	8208000	Playstation Network and
8208000	8210000	millions millions sold
8210000	8212000	through Playstation Network millions
8212000	8214000	just say you're gonna up the graphics
8214000	8216000	slightly and just put like fucking smoothing on
8216000	8218000	it or something and it'll sell zillions
8218000	8220000	I want a new remake
8220000	8222000	I actually do want a new
8222000	8224000	remake wank wank wank wank wank
8224000	8226000	seriously well keep in mind
8226000	8228000	final fantasy 7 is actually one of my favorite RPGs
8228000	8230000	ever it was
8230000	8232000	one of the first ones I played on the Playstation I
8232000	8234000	bought the game before I had a
8234000	8236000	Playstation if that's any indication
8236000	8238000	so I could play it at my friends
8238000	8240000	house I want final fantasy
8240000	8242000	6 to get the love
8242000	8244000	and adoration first before final fantasy 7
8244000	8246000	gets it but final fantasy 7
8246000	8248000	was really
8248000	8250000	I want to say a milestone
8250000	8252000	in the title and the fact that it brought
8252000	8254000	it into the
8254000	8256000	new realm of 3D
8256000	8258000	seriously and I
8258000	8260000	enjoyed the story I love the characters
8260000	8262000	except for Aerith who I was glad was dead
8262000	8264000	dead dead dead dead
8264000	8266000	after the first disc
8266000	8268000	and then they announced
8268000	8270000	final fantasy 7 Aerith's return
8270000	8272000	you know what I actually would not
8272000	8274000	mind seeing so you can kill her again
8274000	8276000	is them putting in the quest that they took out
8276000	8278000	for the US version where you go back and talk
8278000	8280000	to her ghost
8280000	8282000	hmm
8282000	8284000	that I would like to see actually a fully
8284000	8286000	complete version I think that would be cool
8286000	8288000	Bobby's in chat saying I bought my Playstation
8288000	8290000	1 for final fantasy 7 me too
8290000	8292000	you may not know this but me too
8292000	8294000	I couldn't afford the system but I damn well knew enough people who had
8294000	8296000	one and I bought the game
8296000	8298000	I made myself broke because I was working
8298000	8300000	in an arcade but still
8300000	8302000	it was super
8302000	8304000	cool
8304000	8306000	I was like oh my god it's 3D
8306000	8308000	and now I'm like oh my god it's blocky
8308000	8310000	alright
8310000	8312000	well we'll see what is next
8312000	8314000	in store for the final fantasy 7
8314000	8316000	sequels upon
8316000	8318000	sequels upon sequels so
8318000	8320000	alright anyhow
8320000	8322000	let's move on and get to the Skype line
8322000	8324000	if you want to give us a call now is a great time
8324000	8326000	to do so 1-877-GAME-OLR
8326000	8328000	our username on Skype is
8328000	8330000	orange lounge radio
8330000	8332000	let's go to the phones and take a call it's already
8332000	8334000	ringing hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
8334000	8336000	I'm offended
8336000	8338000	whatever
8338000	8340000	on your behalf
8340000	8342000	I am offended for you why
8342000	8344000	I don't know I was just gonna say that
8344000	8346000	hey what's up it's Bobby not much hey Bobby
8346000	8348000	I'm glad you called because you know
8348000	8350000	you have us on your show every week
8350000	8352000	and yet you know we don't get to hear from you
8352000	8354000	all the time usually because you go to bed
8354000	8356000	probably by this time
8356000	8358000	but we got to the Skype line
8358000	8360000	before midnight eastern tonight so I'm glad
8360000	8362000	to hear from you what's up Bobby what do
8362000	8364000	you think of the show tonight
8364000	8366000	I like the show from what I heard I had to go
8366000	8368000	do other things unfortunately so I'll have to listen
8368000	8370000	to the archive but no I actually had a specific reason
8370000	8372000	to call in and specifically
8372000	8374000	talk about this on your show because I
8374000	8376000	heard about this on your show several weeks ago
8376000	8378000	ok and it's
8378000	8380000	regarding iPhone games
8380000	8382000	and to preface this a little bit
8382000	8384000	Apple really takes their user
8384000	8386000	interface and their user experience
8386000	8388000	very seriously when you get
8388000	8390000	into the iPhone developer program there is
8390000	8392000	like this document you have to read through
8392000	8394000	that says this is the user experience
8394000	8396000	we expect for
8396000	8398000	every user of our device
8398000	8400000	and there's one game that
8400000	8402000	completely breaks this user experience
8402000	8404000	and I am very shocked
8404000	8406000	that it's available on the App Store
8406000	8408000	and it's one game that your
8408000	8410000	roommate Rob recommended
8410000	8412000	on this very program
8412000	8414000	oh really and that would be the
8414000	8416000	role playing game he was mentioning a couple weeks ago
8416000	8418000	right, ARVALE
8418000	8420000	A R V A L E, ARVALE
8420000	8422000	it has a lite version and so
8422000	8424000	I played the lite version because you know before
8424000	8426000	I bought the full version and he probably
8426000	8428000	hasn't seen this because he said he bought the full version
8428000	8430000	so you probably never saw the
8430000	8432000	egregious insult
8432000	8434000	to humanity that
8434000	8436000	ARVALE does
8436000	8438000	it's strictly against Apple's
8438000	8440000	user agreement so basically
8440000	8442000	when you're playing a game on your iPhone or an
8442000	8444000	iPod touch what do you expect to
8444000	8446000	happen when you hit the home button
8446000	8448000	the big square button you're gonna
8448000	8450000	go back to the main menu
8450000	8452000	exactly that's what you would think right
8452000	8454000	right and that's exactly
8454000	8456000	what Apple wants all of their
8456000	8458000	developers to do it it has to do it within a certain
8458000	8460000	time frame so you have
8460000	8462000	like literally like three to five seconds
8462000	8464000	maximum to
8464000	8466000	all your stuff save everything and go back to the
8466000	8468000	home menu well ARVALE
8468000	8470000	decided that is the perfect time
8470000	8472000	for them to try to tell you to get more
8472000	8474000	money in the lite version
8474000	8476000	of ARVALE when you hit the home button
8476000	8478000	it loads up Safari
8478000	8480000	so it goes to the menu and then
8480000	8482000	it loads up Safari which then
8482000	8484000	closes and opens up the app store
8484000	8486000	to a non active
8486000	8488000	URL
8488000	8490000	so it goes to the home page of the app store I think
8490000	8492000	they wanted to actually have it
8492000	8494000	pop up the full version of ARVALE so you
8494000	8496000	could buy it but this happens every
8496000	8498000	single time you close the app
8498000	8500000	interesting I'm on
8500000	8502000	an iPod touch so I don't know if it does that if you
8502000	8504000	get a call because I mean
8504000	8506000	I don't have the phone portions or anything
8506000	8508000	oh god that would annoy me
8508000	8510000	but yeah so when you close the app
8510000	8512000	it takes you
8512000	8514000	to Safari first
8514000	8516000	which then closes immediately
8516000	8518000	and takes you to the app store and it winds
8518000	8520000	up that the URL it gives the app store is not a valid
8520000	8522000	URL so it just goes to
8522000	8524000	the featured front page of the
8524000	8526000	app store interesting
8526000	8528000	no I mean you know
8528000	8530000	since John isn't
8530000	8532000	as into the games as the rest
8532000	8534000	of us are he probably didn't even ever really
8534000	8536000	notice this or maybe just kind of you know put up with
8536000	8538000	it because he enjoyed the game or what have you
8538000	8540000	but that's fascinating why do you think Apple
8540000	8542000	you know aren't these things supposed to be
8542000	8544000	I don't know but then again the Apple store is
8544000	8546000	swamped with these types of games
8546000	8548000	so whatever review process they
8548000	8550000	have can't be that thorough
8550000	8552000	so I suppose that's why this type of thing didn't
8552000	8554000	get caught but is it interesting that the game is
8554000	8556000	still on the store
8556000	8558000	after all this
8558000	8560000	it's not that they're not thorough because
8560000	8562000	they would have seen this because it does take
8562000	8564000	several weeks to get approved to go on the app
8564000	8566000	store once you submit it I'm not
8566000	8568000	exactly sure how much I can divulge of
8568000	8570000	it because there is like an NDA involved in stuff
8570000	8572000	but it does take a couple weeks and they do go
8572000	8574000	through and make sure that you're following
8574000	8576000	their user interface guidelines there's
8576000	8578000	several things you cannot do
8578000	8580000	in a game one of which
8580000	8582000	I believe I can go ahead and say is
8582000	8584000	you can't have any buttons on
8584000	8586000	the UI that you can't
8586000	8588000	use so you can't say this
8588000	8590000	button is disabled in the free version you can't
8590000	8592000	do that they will reject your game and they do find
8592000	8594000	that so
8594000	8596000	they do go through and make sure that every
8598000	8600000	in the game
8600000	8602000	in the light version of the game is usable
8602000	8604000	you cannot have any feature that's there
8604000	8606000	but not usable
8606000	8608000	so they go through at least that much because I know
8608000	8610000	a lot of people have complained about getting their stuff
8610000	8612000	sent back because they don't follow
8612000	8614000	these user interface guidelines so I have no
8614000	8616000	clue how RDL lite got away with
8616000	8618000	when you close the game it opens
8618000	8620000	up to other applications I don't know how they got it
8620000	8622000	but that being said I did not play it
8622000	8624000	again I deleted it right then I didn't
8624000	8626000	bother trying any further so I don't know if it's any
8626000	8628000	good or not. Interesting
8628000	8630000	huh that is a pretty shady
8630000	8632000	thing to do though with that
8632000	8634000	that's unfortunate but yeah I know
8634000	8636000	he had the lite version because he was playing it for a little
8636000	8638000	while so
8638000	8640000	but maybe some of us kind of expect
8640000	8642000	that that's what the free games are going to do and it's over
8642000	8644000	if we haven't played so it's interesting to have that insiders
8644000	8646000	perspective that they're technically violating the agreement
8646000	8648000	weird
8648000	8650000	I wonder if anything's going to happen
8650000	8652000	yeah I mean I hope
8652000	8654000	so I should probably report them and stuff but I mean
8654000	8656000	the iTunes reviews don't even mention it
8656000	8658000	there's a
8658000	8660000	then it like opened up three other apps
8660000	8662000	one
8662000	8664000	but like this game is awesome
8664000	8666000	all of our JRPG and stuff so
8666000	8668000	yeah I don't know
8668000	8670000	Bobby you're cutting in and out of there a little bit I don't know what
8670000	8672000	that was all about but
8672000	8674000	maybe yeah maybe it's just
8674000	8676000	I don't know maybe I have no
8676000	8678000	idea it's so weird that people would not call that
8678000	8680000	out in the reviews either
8680000	8682000	now I kind of want to download it to see
8682000	8684000	if it happens with me too
8684000	8686000	we'll see well they
8686000	8688000	updated it so I
8688000	8690000	you know there's no
8690000	8692000	it's a mindset
8692000	8694000	Bobby's cutting in
8694000	8696000	and out really bad Bobby
8696000	8698000	can you still hear us
8698000	8700000	are you guys able
8700000	8702000	to hear me yes we can you're just cutting in and out
8702000	8704000	we have a lot of lag issues going on I don't know what's
8704000	8706000	up with that weird
8706000	8708000	but yeah maybe I don't know could it be that the
8708000	8710000	new patch
8710000	8712000	they put out maybe cut this off
8712000	8714000	maybe
8714000	8716000	hmm interesting
8716000	8718000	so what's this about you guys coming more like
8718000	8720000	FNG with live game play
8720000	8722000	is Loki going to be taking a part
8722000	8724000	of the receiver now no I don't think this is something
8724000	8726000	you can expect every week just when we have something
8726000	8728000	to show you know this is a little special because
8728000	8730000	Loki you know I guess
8730000	8732000	thinks he's the second person ever to
8732000	8734000	attack the game like this I'm sure there's many other people
8734000	8736000	the second person that's actually posted on the internet
8736000	8738000	I see so you know
8738000	8740000	not a lot of people I guess we could say have done this
8740000	8742000	and he wants to kind of show this off and maybe if we have another
8742000	8744000	special game that we want to show
8744000	8746000	like a Tatsunoko vs Capcom kind of thing
8746000	8748000	we're doing fucking excitebots
8748000	8750000	when that comes out but I'm telling you
8750000	8752000	excitebots hell yeah
8752000	8754000	I don't think you can expect this from us every
8754000	8756000	week no I just like tossing
8756000	8758000	cards we don't have a switcher to switch back and forth from
8758000	8760000	the game to the camera and all that stuff so
8760000	8762000	it's one or the other we don't have the fancy
8762000	8764000	little set up that you
8764000	8766000	three camera set up that you have at the
8766000	8768000	gaming arena as soon as we don't have the camera
8768000	8770000	right now this is what
8770000	8772000	you're going to have to get and it's not a video
8772000	8774000	show and I don't think any of us want it
8774000	8776000	to be a video show right now I think we're all interested
8776000	8778000	maybe in doing well some of us are interested in doing video
8778000	8780000	content for the site but not
8780000	8782000	a video show it's Orange Lounge Radio
8782000	8784000	so

8822000	8824000	no but again admittedly I don't think
8824000	8826000	any of us are rabid Call of Duty players
8826000	8828000	so fill us in on what's up
8828000	8830000	put it this way I bought Microsoft points
8830000	8832000	during this time with a points
8832000	8834000	card
8834000	8836000	and uh I come home
8836000	8838000	I come home right just walking home cause
8838000	8840000	gas uh
8840000	8842000	and uh I'm really excited I enter
8842000	8844000	the code in I get my points right and I'm like
8844000	8846000	cool I'm gonna get the maps it says points are added to my
8846000	8848000	account click the button buy the maps since I have
8848000	8850000	insignificant funds
8850000	8852000	I'm freaking out wait a minute are you on Twitter
8852000	8854000	no I'm not on Twitter
8854000	8856000	okay so okay somebody on Twitter
8856000	8858000	on my Twitter and I'm sorry I think was having this
8858000	8860000	exact same problem so yes I do
8860000	8862000	remember hearing about this because like didn't
8862000	8864000	something break down with like the billing service
8864000	8866000	or something that night and a bunch of people tried to redeem
8866000	8868000	their points they didn't get them okay somebody on
8868000	8870000	Twitter was complaining about this exact same thing you're
8870000	8872000	complaining about now that's why I asked this
8872000	8874000	so okay yes I did hear this
8874000	8876000	and I've been talking to Microsoft for
8876000	8878000	since then and they
8878000	8880000	first they told me 5 to 10 days and then after that
8880000	8882000	they told me uh I was
8882000	8884000	gonna get a call and I got the call saying I gotta wait
8884000	8886000	2 to 3 more days after that
8886000	8888000	and which and then the Saturday was supposed to be the
8888000	8890000	third day you know which they said I was supposed to
8890000	8892000	get the points still no points I tried
8892000	8894000	calling and now like they're not taking
8894000	8896000	my call it's
8896000	8898000	wow it's like a bad breakup
8898000	8900000	or something now they're just ditching your call
8900000	8902000	and that's like 20 bucks man
8902000	8904000	I could have done a lot with that like
8904000	8906000	yeah
8906000	8908000	so you never did get the points
8908000	8910000	you're still waiting never got the points still
8910000	8912000	waiting wow they're lucky I'm
8912000	8914000	a patient guy too I'm
8914000	8916000	wondering if it's more than I mean
8916000	8918000	it's gotta be more than just you I should figure out
8918000	8920000	who it was on Twitter and follow up with them too
8920000	8922000	but there's a bunch of people on the Xbox
8922000	8924000	forums that were complaining too well I'm sure
8924000	8926000	some people receive compensation some people
8926000	8928000	still haven't huh so this doesn't
8928000	8930000	have to do necessarily with Call of Duty
8930000	8932000	specifically it's just that it
8932000	8934000	broke Microsoft server somehow
8934000	8936000	well in a way it does have to do with Call of Duty
8936000	8938000	it's due to all the people wanting to
8938000	8940000	play Call of Duty I see
8940000	8942000	huh
8942000	8944000	well I did you were you
8944000	8946000	ever able to get the map pack like did you invest
8946000	8948000	the points later no I still haven't gotten it yet
8948000	8950000	good for you holding out because there's
8950000	8952000	there's some people that are too passive probably
8952000	8954000	myself included that would have just ended up
8954000	8956000	spending the points when the building was fixed I've been playing Call of Duty 4
8956000	8958000	and got it anyway
8958000	8960000	burnout paradise
8960000	8962000	act deft and it says
8962000	8964000	Major Nelson covered this in his Twitter maybe it's the
8964000	8966000	person you think it is Rob
8966000	8968000	no I know Major Nelson was responding
8968000	8970000	to it but I distinctly remember there were people on
8970000	8972000	my Twitter like that too it's Major Nelson
8972000	8974000	who took it and he's just sitting in his bathtub
8974000	8976000	wiping his ass with 20 dollar bills
8976000	8978000	with points
8978000	8980000	I somehow doubt
8980000	8982000	that the poor guy has to look I do
8982000	8984000	not envy what Major Nelson does okay
8984000	8986000	because he has to take the heat of the
8986000	8988000	entirety of the internet and it's not him
8988000	8990000	that's screwing up you know it's
8990000	8992000	sometimes a computer error or something
8992000	8994000	that's true he gets paid to do it
8994000	8996000	but you know I don't envy him
8996000	8998000	Major Nelson's not really a person he's just like
8998000	9000000	the voice on the computer in Star Trek
9000000	9002000	that's all he really is
9002000	9004000	and what you see is just a hologram
9004000	9006000	he doesn't exist
9006000	9008000	it's all a lie
9008000	9010000	like the cake
9010000	9012000	computer error
9012000	9014000	that's what you're going to find out
9014000	9016000	on our very last episode of
9016000	9018000	OLR because someday it has to happen folks
9018000	9020000	there will be a final episode of OLR
9020000	9022000	and that's when the twist is going to be it was all
9022000	9024000	just a dream
9024000	9026000	I just
9026000	9028000	we need to get this problem out there that there are
9028000	9030000	people out here that paid money
9030000	9032000	and not just me I mean other people
9032000	9034000	that have wasted their money
9034000	9036000	and there could be kids
9036000	9038000	you know that don't have there could have been kids
9038000	9040000	buying this stuff they don't have that much money
9040000	9042000	you know
9042000	9044000	I know there's definitely a problem out there
9044000	9046000	it's weird that I haven't seen this on a lot of game blogs
9046000	9048000	but then again if I see Call of Duty 4 in the headline
9048000	9050000	or Call of Duty whatever
9050000	9052000	I'd probably scroll past it
9052000	9054000	just because
9054000	9056000	I don't play those types of games myself
9058000	9060000	alright well thank you for helping to get the word out
9060000	9062000	by the way about Final Fantasy 7
9062000	9064000	it's very emo
9064000	9066000	and I did not like it
9066000	9068000	10 was better
9068000	9070000	out of curiosity how old are you?
9070000	9072000	me?
9072000	9074000	I am
9074000	9076000	17
9076000	9078000	see there's something about that particular
9078000	9080000	see I was like 19
9080000	9082000	when the game came out
9082000	9084000	so I don't know if it's something about a generational thing
9084000	9086000	but I notice a lot of younger people
9086000	9088000	like your age and young 20's
9088000	9090000	have a lot more hate for Final Fantasy 7
9090000	9092000	and don't understand what makes it so freaking great
9092000	9094000	but then again
9094000	9096000	I replayed it actually recently
9096000	9098000	I know I know but it doesn't stack up to today's games
9098000	9100000	what I'm saying is that at the time
9100000	9102000	it was the shit
9102000	9104000	this is again
9104000	9106000	this is why I bought a Playstation
9106000	9108000	but again it's not for everybody
9108000	9110000	I mean I admit that
9110000	9112000	and I don't think Final Fantasy 7 by any means is like the greatest game ever made
9112000	9114000	or any of that so
9114000	9116000	you know
9116000	9118000	many sequels makes me angry
9118000	9120000	I like 7 and I like 10
9120000	9122000	it is possible
9122000	9124000	but I also liked 11 for a little while
9124000	9126000	alright anyhow Death Wishing we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls
9126000	9128000	but thank you so much for calling and have a great week okay
9128000	9130000	screw you Microsoft
9130000	9132000	bye
9132000	9134000	hope that stuff gets worked out
9134000	9136000	that sucks that Microsoft is just kinda like
9136000	9138000	a responses thing that's kinda shady
9138000	9140000	in my opinion that's just kinda weird
9140000	9142000	um I think we'll do like one more call
9142000	9144000	guys then we're gonna wrap up cause it's like getting
9144000	9146000	pretty late hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio

9148000	9150000	hello you're on OrangeLawnsRadio
9150000	9152000	who's this
9152000	9154000	is your microphone on
9154000	9156000	sir or madam
9156000	9158000	I guess not
9158000	9160000	alright I'll wait for one more call
9160000	9162000	see
9162000	9164000	what happens
9164000	9166000	hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio who's this
9166000	9168000	take 2 is it actually working this time
9168000	9170000	yes it is hi how are you
9170000	9172000	this is Jason I'm 23 and I'm an addict
9172000	9174000	oh I mean I'm a Final Fantasy 7
9174000	9176000	fan did I get that right
9176000	9178000	close enough what's on your mind buddy
9178000	9180000	no anti fan wank about
9180000	9182000	scratch tonight
9182000	9184000	yeah you know I saw the story in the thread
9184000	9186000	and then I kinda you know
9186000	9188000	but here's the thing is that I figured we kind of
9188000	9190000	already talked about it a couple weeks ago
9190000	9192000	I love how everybody is describing the controller
9192000	9194000	and I have a fucking picture of it it's awesome
9194000	9196000	I know I kind of feel like we already covered it
9196000	9198000	like that this new thing didn't really show us anything we didn't
9198000	9200000	already know or did you catch something we did not
9200000	9202000	which is possible
9202000	9204000	I think it's more the fact that I probably
9204000	9206000	didn't catch it because you guys probably
9206000	9208000	talked to it on a night that I went out to the hockey game
9208000	9210000	and so I didn't I missed the part of the show
9210000	9212000	that you guys talked I am just
9212000	9214000	weeks behind with this crap aren't I
9214000	9216000	it's fine it's fine I tried to
9216000	9218000	break up DDRS you already covered it in your gaming
9218000	9220000	week I'm trying to bring up this it's old news
9220000	9222000	well then
9222000	9224000	don't worry about if you're covering something we've already
9224000	9226000	covered or not tell us what you think because this show
9226000	9228000	is all about the user interaction
9228000	9230000	anyway you are a long time Bamani
9230000	9232000	fan obviously I met you through
9232000	9234000	such avenues as DDR Freak and all this stuff
9234000	9236000	I know you're a Rabid2DX fan what do you think
9236000	9238000	of Scratch? Where every gamer
9238000	9240000	has a voice I
9240000	9242000	it's I have the
9242000	9244000	same feelings for it that I do for Rockband
9244000	9246000	I've said this many times before and I'll
9246000	9248000	continue to say it I've played a lot
9248000	9250000	of Guitar Freaks I've played a lot of Drummania
9250000	9252000	Guitar Hero was really fun
9252000	9254000	and then Rockband blew everything right
9254000	9256000	out of the freaking water
9256000	9258000	it's a great game
9258000	9260000	Rockband 2 didn't change very much
9260000	9262000	but it's a great game
9262000	9264000	I've
9264000	9266000	loved the Beatmania series I have played one of
9266000	9268000	each of them original Beatmania
9268000	9270000	original yes Beatmania
9270000	9272000	Gameboy as Black Wolf showed off
9272000	9274000	on Friday Night Gaming two weeks ago
9274000	9276000	I've obviously played lots of
9276000	9278000	2DX and I've played a couple Beatmania 3's
9278000	9280000	including some songs with the foot pedal
9282000	9284000	the thing that's different with Scratch
9284000	9286000	is that I'm not looking
9286000	9288000	forward to it to the majority of
9288000	9290000	the song list because based
9290000	9292000	off what the trailer revealed for the artists
9292000	9294000	I don't care for a lot of those I don't care for
9294000	9296000	a lot of those artists
9296000	9298000	and I'm hoping they bust out some really good
9298000	9300000	electronic music not gonna happen
9300000	9302000	because it's scratching
9302000	9304000	that's why there's not a lot of scratching
9304000	9306000	in electronica but they are trying to
9306000	9308000	feature stuff that would work with that
9308000	9310000	something to put
9310000	9312000	in perspective as well and
9312000	9314000	as much as this hurts to say this game
9314000	9316000	was not made for you and it was not made for
9316000	9318000	me and it wasn't really made for fans of
9318000	9320000	Bamani who are kinda ticked off that
9320000	9322000	Beatmania never really took off here
9322000	9324000	because of what some would argue was a
9324000	9326000	poor first showing
9326000	9328000	even though DDR had a poor first showing as well
9328000	9330000	and it really grew and took off from there but
9330000	9332000	this game was not made for you and me
9332000	9336880	this game was made for folks that want to have an authentic DJing experience
9336880	9341160	with a certain genre of music that may not be our preferred genre yeah and the
9341160	9345760	American DJ scene is a lot different than overseas scenes I'm pointing more at
9345760	9350000	like UK and European very true Japanese very very true they're gonna put stuff
9350000	9353800	in it as long as you can scratch to it I mean that's basically gonna be it and I
9353800	9357880	hate you know reading that everyone's like oh it's such a ripoff of Beatmania
9357880	9362280	yeah it the interface is similar and like it way it's played is similar but
9362280	9366300	the whole scratching stuff is totally different than what they've done in
9366300	9370400	Beatmania. Beatmania is just another way to hit another button whereas this is
9370400	9375400	actually detecting real-life scratch techniques using the crossfader and
9375400	9379140	stuff you're doing the same techniques it's like skate you know where you're
9379140	9383040	doing techniques that you you can actually do except this you're actually
9383040	9387560	performing them how you would if you did this on a turntable a real turntable it
9387560	9391400	would be it sound exactly the same and again it's hard to say without playing
9391400	9395400	it yet but I would say it's very similar to how a lot of people when they first
9395400	9399920	saw Guitar Hero were like oh it's just guitar freaks but then when you actually
9399920	9405440	play it you're like but it's so much better what made well that's kind of a
9405440	9409040	bad comparison only and the Guitar Hero did play the same it just looked a lot
9409040	9413960	better because it had the whole 3d landscape and had a solid scrolling and
9413960	9418280	way better tailored to the masses yeah absolutely and I completely understand
9418280	9421800	that it's just kind of disappointing to the same man at the same time because I
9421800	9426840	would really love a DJ sim but again I'm not sure that I'm gonna be a big fan of
9426840	9430760	the soundtrack and that's unfortunate all things considered look at the big
9430760	9433680	picture though if this game does really really well in this controllers out
9433680	9437000	there and it penetrates the marketplace it does open the door for the get type
9437000	9441260	of game you want in the future so Konami can release beat revolution just to have
9441260	9445600	a go the whole bundle for 20 bucks two months later after its release you know
9445600	9451640	in a weird way yes and yeah and I think the thing everyone's like getting all
9451640	9456400	like a big-ass boner for fucking you know DJ here and we don't even know
9456400	9461640	anything about it yet they have a teaser pages like oh my god it's epic it's a
9461640	9466160	teaser page it doesn't show anything it's like really know what it's like
9466160	9470600	scratch oh wait I mean all it's gonna be is mixing music the other mashups yeah
9470600	9473760	that makes me interested in it because you know I kind of like doing that kind
9473760	9477000	of stuff I'm really interested in scratch because I've seen what the
9477000	9482960	controller looks like it's fucking awesome so you know I I don't know I
9482960	9487240	it'll be really cool to see when it comes out you know people I'm sure gonna
9487240	9492640	say oh it's you know such a ripoff the color wise but the colors match the
9492640	9497440	colors of the Xbox 360 controller they match up to what they are on the
9497440	9500480	controller because you're gonna be able to play this with a controller if you
9500480	9503360	want you know for two-player or something like that so you know you
9503360	9506200	don't want to buy another pad or something you can do that with like I
9506200	9512040	think the analog six and stuff but it's gonna be pretty awesome and it just it
9512040	9515500	really comes down to the song list and the marketing behind it they've got a
9515500	9519520	good marketing team it's the marketing team is the guitar hero too you know and
9519520	9524120	I think it's gonna be really awesome and you haven't seen everything on it yet
9524120	9528480	and they're really gonna start revealing a lot starting pretty much in April and
9528480	9531720	onto the release which was originally supposed to be in June but now I hear
9531720	9539200	sometime in the summer so you know I I have to reiterate and I know you were
9539200	9543120	talking you were you targeted more than people who are complaining at it for the
9543120	9545960	sake of complaining I really am looking forward to the game Rob you're
9545960	9549480	absolutely right it's oh it's gonna open the door to a lot of good things guitar
9549480	9554120	hero open the door to be sold off to be turned into rock band by the same by
9554120	9558320	similar companies and as I already said at the top of this that was amazing yes
9558320	9562280	the progression that's gonna happen three years down the road stands to be
9562280	9566480	excellent absolutely awesome and if I don't like the first game and the second
9566480	9571320	game has a better soundtrack great absolutely great baby steps Jason we got
9571320	9574680	to wrap up and go so we can wrap up the show but do you have any other parting
9574680	9579040	thoughts for our listeners tonight I'm trying to think of something witty and
9579040	9581880	nothing's coming to me so I guess not Jason what are we gonna hang out again I
9581880	9585000	haven't seen you in like five years you know it's funny I was reading the thing
9585000	9588560	the stuff about e3 coming around again and I kind of want to make that as a
9588560	9592400	trip this year I think you should but I don't want to drive that long and I
9592400	9596400	probably would be driving and not to mention with the new with the new house
9596400	9600480	and whatnot all money situation saving blah blah blah I know I'm trying to work
9600480	9604760	on it we have some other ideas and I just need to have some steel deals yeah
9604760	9608800	seriously I think our tickets down the southwest because we're going down there
9608800	9615280	for Nellie's birthday and for e3 is like $59 $79 we were ridiculous I flew to
9615280	9620120	Burbank for 69 and that's like cheaper than what it cost me in gas and you guys
9620120	9623620	would definitely be flying again to LA this year and not road tripping like we
9623620	9627360	did yeah I'm how does I do yet I might be I might be road tripping I haven't
9627360	9630920	decided yet it depends because I don't know how much my husband comes with me
9630920	9633360	then I'll be road tripping I don't know how much I want to get into my personal
9633360	9636600	life but I might be going to Vegas right after for a personal engagement so if
9636600	9639120	that's the case I'm gonna fly because I can't take oh I know what you're talking
9639120	9646200	about the reopening that I can't believe that that's cool anyhow Jason we gotta
9646200	9649200	let you go but well you know if nothing else you need to make it a point bring
9649200	9653040	rye come to Disneyland at some point that sounds pretty awesome although I'm
9653040	9657280	kind of a chicken on roller coasters but hey oh it's Disneyland there you go
9657280	9663800	that's right you tell him right hey I am the world's biggest chicken and I get in
9663800	9667520	the front for this damn that's right me and rye California screaming front front
9667520	9671320	row be awesome she'll enjoy that in about 30 seconds when it comes around
9671320	9674240	with you Jason and by the way it's actually the Jason and locate can hold
9674240	9679760	hands in the back then hey we're not gonna go on but it was a trip I making
9679760	9684200	all right Jason I gotta let you go buddy take care I like guys bye what do you
9684200	9689120	mean I can be able to go on roller coaster rides no reason okay anyhow
9689120	9693560	because because I can't stand the adrenaline rush and Nelly gets sick she
9693560	9696960	gets motion sick really easy actually all right well you guys so do I but not
9696960	9699960	in the front row you guys can just ride the fucking pair of tires you were right
9699960	9705080	it's a small world over and over again if whatever in the middle I'd get six
9705080	9711600	six six six six sitting in the front no problem awesome all right that's it we
9711600	9715120	get a wrap we're trying to wrap up get out of here and get to our afterbirth
9715120	9717840	and all that stuff but we've had a wonderful show tonight yes Jamie I want
9717840	9723520	to know who is interested in winning a turbo graphics 16 with no controllers
9723520	9730120	no plug no hookups just a turbo graphics 16 and they go along with that I have a
9730120	9734560	Sega Saturn to the same same deal there so to Saturn maybe we can sign them or
9734560	9738680	something we'll sign them even though I don't think our signatures are worth
9738680	9741600	that much but I'm sure some of our listeners let us know the mailbag who's
9741600	9745800	interested there's people already saying me me me me me I'll take it I do so why
9745800	9751200	the hell do you want our broken out it's free shit maybe I'll throw in some old
9751200	9756360	e3 swag you know I have I have hella old e3 swag I'll throw into we'll just have
9756360	9761920	a win free shit from olr and just send out grab bags of shit your own plug of
9761920	9769160	shit be why OP all right lots of stuff anyhow not literal shit by the way you
9769160	9773120	sick people okay last-minute story since I forgot to get to that a dark soccer I
9773120	9775800	think you said you had one that was a holdover for the mailbag actually that
9775800	9778880	was it I have to graphic 16 I'm giving it away
9778880	9782520	Loki did you have anything tonight or yeah I had a few things okay they're
9782520	9787040	first off there's Star Trek DAC we heard a little bit about it was teased on DVD
9787040	9790600	release that they had for the Star Trek series it's actually going to be an
9790600	9795680	Xbox Live and PlayStation Network title a little bit similar to what we saw with
9795680	9801400	what was it the Bellstar Galactica thing so that's gonna be good or bad I'm not
9801400	9803560	sure how you can take it but supposed to come out around the same time as the
9803560	9807920	movie so within the next month or so Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 was announced
9807920	9811520	actually I think last week and there's some more information coming out about
9811520	9816480	that the game of course is going to be a kind of a port or I don't know what
9816480	9820960	Ninja Gaiden black was to Ninja Gaiden say or Sigma the first one it basically
9820960	9824800	they're gonna take Ninja Gaiden 2 and they're going to add a bunch of stuff in
9824800	9827800	there including there's going to be dead or lives
9827800	9832440	Ayane in there as well they're gonna bring back the chick from the first game
9832440	9839600	I think and there's also the female warrior from Ninja Gaiden dragon sword
9839600	9846120	which is on the DS so that's kind of neat file front is shutting down so no
9846120	9852400	more patches and demos from that site which is too bad speaking of iPhone
9852400	9856320	games nobody nobody boy has been announced to be coming to the iPhone
9856320	9863520	that's scary there's another thing to they're saying that nobody nobody boy I
9863520	9873240	guess she was saying that in order to get to the end of I guess Pluto it would
9873240	9876920	take a hundred twenty years of the current rate right now so I don't know
9876920	9879640	if we'll ever see the end of this game or if they even program the end of this
9879640	9884760	game and then rob kind of alluded to it a little bit ago that we're gonna be
9884760	9888840	seeing some Final Fantasy tiles on the virtual console including there's I
9888840	9893000	think the cell phone gave me that had was sequel to Final Fantasy for the
9893000	9897160	after years as well which is pretty sweet and of course one that I know Rob
9897160	9900200	was excited about Hello Kitty online has been announced to be coming to the US
9900200	9903240	how did we miss that on Cheryl tonight I don't even know maybe I'm waiting for
9903240	9907680	the game to come out itself and one other iPhone app that I saw a little
9907680	9916080	thing on apparently there's an iPhone fart app that had apparently yippy
9916080	9925280	apparently the iPhone phone app aromatic and there that's the maker of pull my
9925280	9929320	finger apparently they're in negotiations to sell dispute pull my
9929320	9934440	finger once upon a time I guess was an application on the iTunes Store and
9934440	9940720	apparently was being overtaken by I fart which is now done two hundred thousand
9940720	9947840	dollars in sales since its release and now they're I guess saying that it's
9947840	9955960	been kind of ripping off of the one of the other I guess and there's some
9955960	9963200	patent lawsuits I guess I don't know really it's a farting app for the iPhone
9963200	9966920	do we really need this no we don't answer your question
9966920	9970720	all right let's go around to your base final thoughts we can wrap up and get
9970720	9979040	the hell out of here for tonight dark soccer and my final thought is wine is
9979040	9985520	tasty did it help to chill the glass Rob I didn't show long enough this is my
9985520	9989160	favorite one I did I can definitely tell leaving the bottle open really ruined
9989160	9996160	the way it was yummy on Friday your final thought my final thought is and
9996160	10000840	this is just kind of a PSA but just remember that this Wednesday happens to
10000840	10006680	be the first day of a certain month namely April which people like to pull
10006680	10011240	pranks and announce fake things and whatnot so just be wary of anything
10011240	10015360	that's being announced next week as there's a very likely chance that's
10015360	10020040	gonna be fake and most people if they have legitimate to announce they're not
10020040	10026120	gonna do it next week so just be aware I got a thought for the contest of giving
10026120	10031320	shit away if we wanted to like take those things those Saturn in the
10031320	10036600	turbo graphics and take them to e3 and get like Bobby and Scott and all them to
10036600	10039560	sign it then they might be worth a little more cuz they have all of our
10039560	10041880	signatures on it and how often are we all under one roof
10041880	10046560	hmm I might be Scott was on TV years ago I mean his autographs were something
10046560	10052200	right I don't know the only one left of us on TV too that's true we were on the
10052200	10058720	local news that all right I was a Wow expert on the news a few months ago all
10058720	10061760	right forget it we're done we're out of here have a great week everybody will
