13936	15900	Tonight, March 29th, 2009.
16661	19065	Will OnLive be the next great console?
19306	22191	Could Netflix come out for PlayStation 3 and Wii?
22612	25798	And the classic 8-bit game is re-released for the iPhone.
31741	36305	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36385	43210	We're back after a week vacation to talk more about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43290	49595	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week, as well as my awesome co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50335	50656	Hi.
50856	52037	How are you, Miss Jamie Summers?
52958	53218	I am.
53956	55517	You are, because you is?
55777	56097	I don't know.
56357	56697	I be.
57458	58098	Because you be.
58638	62040	Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
62300	62920	How's it going?
63220	63960	Good, how are you?
64661	67102	Could have been better, because... Yeah?
67122	72104	Yeah, Adobe... I don't know what it is, it's just like an ongoing theme of my laptop.
73364	74145	An update...
75091	76292	Flash Media Encoder
90368	102113	Just to kind of explain a little bit for the listeners, especially those on the podcast, we do tape live, obviously, and live radio has interesting advantages, as in we get to interact with you guys live, and disadvantages, as two things don't always work the way we planned.
102473	115339	So Loki is trying to show something on Justin TV, our video feed, which we'll get into a little bit later, but he's unable to do it because, for whatever reason, his laptop suddenly decided it didn't want to cooperate with the video anymore.
115399	117620	Yeah, it wants to do audio, but no video.
117640	118460	Yeah, it's weird, so...
118840	121162	But you know, this type of thing is not limited to PCs.
121202	129168	I'll tell you what, my laptop, my MacBook's been out of commission for like a month because an Apple update screwed up my boot up.
129288	133211	Like, it'll get to the gray screen and I get the spinning wheel and it just freezes there.
133972	138456	And from everything I've been told, I just need to reinstall OS X, but I don't have that disk anymore.
138476	141578	I don't know where the hell I put it when I first, I bought my laptop like a year and a half ago and, you know,
141678	143139	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
164200	170422	For a little while, it actually was non-existent, given that I had a midterm last week and lots of school crap to do.
172623	181426	But I did actually play Cooking Mama for iPhone, which is, it's only got a few recipes on it, so it's super short.
182006	184267	But I like the control on it better than on the DS.
184287	185188	It's actually pretty fun.
185568	189269	So that's one game that translates itself very, very well for iPhones.
189349	192650	And for those that don't remember, DarkSakura loves her Cooking Mama on DS.
192830	193530	Yep, sure do.
196271	201172	And I actually downloaded another game, let me find the name of it, because it's also on iPhone.
201592	206933	Really, a lot of my gaming has been iPhone-based lately, except for last night, which I'll get into in just a second.
207333	212474	It's called Light Bike, and it's a free light cycle game, like in Tron.
213254	213894	So it's pretty cool.
214995	215295	And then...
217175	221757	I wouldn't say this is a game, but it's a fun little app as I've been playing with my Koi Pond lately.
223438	239505	And also, as I'm being reminded via hint, hint, hint, is I did actually review Cooking Mama on AvengersTower.com, so if you want to check it out, you can see my full review there.
239805	240346	No, wait a minute.
240406	241966	Not OrangeLaunchRadio.com?
242527	245428	You review games over on Giggling Girl's site, but you won't do it...
247195	247856	I'm just messing.
248056	250598	We're getting Tiara over, hopefully, to do game reviews as well, right?
250818	251138	For us?
251999	252319	Hopefully?
252499	252679	Yes?
252719	253080	Thumbs up?
253160	253340	Good.
253660	254160	There is hope.
254180	254801	That would be beautiful.
254981	255802	Hope in the positive direction.
255822	258223	That would be beautiful.
258263	258384	Yes.
258404	261546	She plays a lot of games I never get around to playing, so I like reading her reviews.
263373	268799	Last night was all about the Rufus belly for Street Fighter 4.
269539	274605	Last night at my house, we got it on with video games in a big way.
275166	279611	My husband and I, and no it wasn't anything kinky, we decided... Got it on, huh?
279951	280932	With video games?
281193	281473	Sick.
281673	282674	Hush, hush, hush.
283334	289598	Last night, we decided that we were going to totally go for the PC Engine fun.
289999	295963	So we broke out our PC Engine core graphics so we could play our Japanese cue cards.
296123	302627	And then we broke out the Turbo Duo, which we've got to play the import CDs.
303247	307050	We found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone, and I was so happy.
307750	311053	My copy of Space Fantasy Zone, however, has a hole in it.
311893	315558	Not a hole where the spindle goes, but a hole in the disc.
316299	318602	Therefore, we got to the first boss.
318742	319864	How does that even happen?
320024	320445	I don't know.
321026	321206	Wow.
321226	322107	There's shit in my house.
322608	325672	But we got to the first boss and it's like, Game over!
326112	326613	I quit!
327114	327634	You win!
327935	328435	Game over!
329409	345159	No more... And for people who don't know, basically, Space Fantasy Zone, because the Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone are set in the same universe, it's basically Fantasy Zone from the Space Harrier behind the player perspective.
346340	353445	So it's pretty cool, and it has remixes of all the old Fantasy Zone music done in sort of that Space Harrier style.
354205	354305	And...
355626	359049	I'll have to actually bring you tracks to play on this show sometime, Rob.
359089	362171	They're really cool.
362952	364954	Now, this game is also a prototype.
365174	366235	They did not release it.
366815	372900	They had just base cover artwork for it, and it never, as far as I'm aware, never got an official release.
373541	381947	And so I've been racking my brain trying to find some way to burn a new copy of the game, but hell, if I know how to burn multi-session, you know...
382868	385835	Audio and data weird compilation.
385895	388320	I found how to do it, but it's a lot of hard work and I'm lazy.
390046	391027	Goldanthro in chat says, a hole in the disc?
414126	414886	Disc sex?
415366	416907	Since you know you're talking about getting it on and all.
417327	420108	And GameGuru says, holy disc.
421888	423048	He forgot the Batman part.
423248	425429	Holy disc, Batman.
425509	429650	To be specific, it wasn't actually a physical hole through it, I found out.
430110	438472	But somehow or another, on both sides of the disc, the covering on it had been scratched off.
439312	441634	The following program is intended for mature audiences.
441674	442174	And there you go.
461564	462044	Just so you know.
462124	462925	Don't say we didn't warn you.
463606	468469	Alright, anything else in your gaming week besides such nerdy PC Engine retro fun?
468549	469390	Oh, there's a lot more.
469550	469830	Oh yeah?
470151	472352	Well, it was all PC Engine though, nerdy fun.
473213	478037	Just to name off some of the games that we're playing, we put in Dracula X, Ys, Book 1 and 2.
478757	480038	Freaking epic!
482520	486183	We played Legend of the Valkyries, Son Son, Twinbee.
486343	488385	We broke out our copy of Twinbee.
489305	489426	And...
491677	492518	What else did we play?
492578	494519	God, because I put pictures up on the gallery.
495440	498701	I took a picture of my foot next to our PC Engine Core graphics.
499082	502324	So you can see how little the PC Engine Core graphics is compared to my foot.
504085	512770	We also played Final Lap Twin, Victory Run, Keith Courage.
512810	515452	No, we didn't play Keith Courage because that game is crap.
516412	517133	Adventure Island.
517353	519054	We played Adventure Island, which is pretty fun.
519734	523517	So, yeah, we were getting on with the Hudson play last night.
523537	524117	It was pretty cool.
525198	525839	Good times.
526079	526319	Yep.
526879	527920	Lots of classic gaming.
529561	535066	By the way, folks, before we get into Loki's Gaming Week here, JustinTV's now up, if you're listening live.
535126	539849	And, Loki, I'm assuming you're going to talk about what's going on here on JustinTV while you're talking about your Gaming Week.
539909	540590	Yeah.
540810	546314	Basically, like I said, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto, mainly Lost in Damn, because that's all I play.
546814	546954	But...
548342	549063	Oh yeah, I forgot.
549523	551444	This is my boss's 360.
551985	556868	Well, technically it's my 360, but it's the one that he uses because I own five of them for some reason.
556948	557588	But this is my old 360.
557849	559630	It's modded.
560070	563172	So I figured out how to hack Grand Theft Auto 4.
563613	574460	And basically because Rockstar is so lazy when it comes to programming that they literally use files that have been around since, you know, and it froze for a second there.
575281	576201	Oh, phone call.
576942	577002	Um,
577972	585934	Anyway, so basically, it uses the same PC files and stuff, so you can edit it the same way as you'd edit, like, you know, handling files and that kind of thing.
586374	591575	So, for example, I can kick that motorcycle really hard, and it will go flying.
593475	594835	Because I edited the physics.
595516	596156	Nice.
596176	597156	The punching and stuff.
597236	597736	It's just fun.
598396	601657	Because my boss, he's... Oh, they're going to orbit.
601937	602497	They seriously will.
602517	604337	A bunch of person is flying into orbit here.
604377	605098	I know this is horrible.
605298	606138	Oh, my God.
606198	607018	They just disappeared.
609952	612094	Sorry, I know this is crappy radio.
614356	614976	That's awesome.
615276	616417	That is fantastic.
616457	617558	I love it.
617919	620521	I'm sure this will be in the archives as well.
621041	622362	We'll play it during break.
623103	624704	There's a lot more stuff you can tweak.
624724	631290	Basically, you can edit it like you can edit the PC version if you know how to do it.
631350	636734	We've played it online between the five of us that play Grand Theft Auto because
637515	638035	Thanks for watching!
653256	661100	We got a weird side effect was anybody that got near him would get the same kind of upgrades to their weapons, so it kind of canceled each other out.
661480	664582	The only thing is it doesn't affect vehicle handling.
664622	667483	If he gets into a bus, they're basically like rockets now.
667523	669924	They just go really fast and smash through everything.
670665	671745	That won't affect other people.
671785	676708	And also physics on the weapons, like the punching I was just doing, that won't affect other people.
676748	679109	And if you try to punch another player that you're playing with,
679189	680570	DarkTetsuya says, so now it's Hancock the video game?
680590	681630	DeathWishing says, Falcon Punch!
707286	712071	Um, X-Link says he's Siler, and Actdeft says Grand Theft Auto would crack down physics?
712131	713051	Cool, freaking awesome.
713612	716194	So, that was pretty hilarious, that's kind of funny.
716294	730807	It's basically, I mean, if you were the, you could potentially cheat in the online games with this, but you'd be banned pretty quick, and I'm surprised, I mean, this, I'm guessing he's going to be banned eventually, but what do I care, because, you know, it's my boss, it's not me, so, you know.
730827	731708	Yeah.
732448	733709	I hope he doesn't listen.
734290	735170	No, he doesn't listen.
735230	737732	It's my modded console anyway, so what do I care?
738453	740594	But no, it's just a really fun experiment.
740935	749981	As far as I'm aware, I mean, I'm sure other people have done it, but the only video I've seen online, there's only been one person that's done it, and he's the guy that actually made this program called Open4, which is...
750822	751923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
772113	772653	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
797110	797991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
812421	814683	I don't know, it's fun to just watch TV and play that game.
815144	825173	And then I also tried Trackmania DS, which is pretty good, but the only thing that kind of sucks about it is because the DS screens are so small, your field of view is really small in the game.
825213	830938	But other than that, it's basically just the same as the PC version, which is pretty awesome.
831519	832459	So that's kind of cool.
832720	833500	And then...
835976	839281	I think that's about it, really, because I wanted to play a lot more games.
839301	843126	I was meaning to install that new update for the Wii.
844007	848353	You know, not exactly the same way as you'd normally update it, but you know,
848962	849422	Special way.
850682	853023	Because I got a 16 gigabyte card to go with that.
853563	856083	So maybe we'll hear some more about this next week.
856764	860704	By the way, Tigerclaw in chat says you should hack Peggle and put in some crazy-ass physics.
861165	862205	Just like you did in Grand Theft Auto.
862265	865325	It's not as easy to hack other games.
865345	872067	Seriously, Grand Theft Auto, if you literally extract all the files that are in those compressings, it's exactly the same as what you see on the PC.
872487	873367	Formats are the same.
873627	875467	Files are actually somewhat the same.
875567	877768	The only thing that's different is the texture files and stuff.
878208	878889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
893786	894747	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
922961	923642	CD-ROM drive.
923663	925286	I literally took the CD-ROM drive apart.
925827	929093	Unfortunately, that thing spins so fast, it's impossible to do that.
929534	929814	Wow.
931036	931457	But it's fun.
931838	932138	It's cool.
932559	932860	Alright.
934097	937841	Repeat at your own risk because he's voiding all sorts of warranties.
937881	939002	All sorts of warranties.
939943	942465	If one of these Xboxes is E74s, tough shit.
942605	943206	Yeah, exactly.
943286	943906	And you know what?
944227	946289	I'm not going to go post online how to do this.
947350	952735	Basically, you can figure it out the same way as you would modify a song in Guitar Hero or something.
952755	953576	Yeah.
954356	955377	The information is out there.
955397	956818	You just have to figure it out.
957118	959620	I don't want a lot of people online cheating like hell.
960721	961381	I'm not doing that.
962262	963003	We do it for fun.
963043	966125	For your own amusement.
967826	971469	As you can see, there's no way I'm faking this since it's lost and damned.
971549	973270	There's no way to port that to the PC yet.
975231	975632	It's just fun.
976121	976521	All right.
976541	980023	So I think you're going to kind of play a little bit on and off throughout the night.
980183	991109	You might kind of pause as you're reading news stories and so on, but you can kind of watch the action go down at JustinTV, which is also available, thanks to Dekeman for reminding me, we have it in a little box now on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
991129	993150	I'm not used to it being like right there on our homepage, but it is.
993490	998853	So you can just look at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and you can like read the reviews that were posted this week and watch JustinTV at the same time.
998893	999314	It's pretty cool.
1000174	1001376	So, My Gaming Week.
1001496	1005040	Gosh, since we've been out for two weeks, I actually got caught up on quite a few games.
1005400	1008824	Retro Game Challenge is just so adorable on the Nintendo DS.
1008864	1010907	I can't think of a better way to describe this game.
1011307	1012168	It's really adorable.
1012228	1016534	Basically what they did, they took a lot of inspired 8-bit games.
1016574	1019317	I mean, they're all original, old-school retro games that you play in this.
1019637	1020157	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1040836	1043138	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1061434	1067459	There's game magazines that you look through and get new tips out of, and of course they have cheat codes.
1068039	1074244	There's all these little throwbacks to things we might remember from the 80s, like really bad English in some of the games and all this stuff.
1074504	1078447	Here's the only thing I didn't like about Retro Game Challenge is that everything was very sequential.
1078467	1085032	When you buy the game, you have to start with a particular shooter game, then move on to the racing game, then move on.
1085573	1088275	I kind of would have liked a little more openness, even if...
1088815	1091076	It didn't, you know, give you everything at once.
1091476	1098158	Maybe if you started with three of the games and you could kind of go back and forth and beat the challenges you wanted to in one and then move on to another.
1100018	1108381	I would have liked to see a little more freedom in the way the actual game itself was set up, but it's not enough to really distract from the fact that the game is really a throwback to the old school days.
1108741	1116784	So, honestly, excuse me, if you were a kid gaming in the 1980s, I think you'd need a kick out of this and might want to check it out on the Nintendo DS.
1117424	1117504	Um...
1118723	1121084	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1142170	1142830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1171986	1172807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1192535	1195037	Final Fantasy Crystal Defenders Flash Tower Defender
1213237	1214077	Thanks for watching!
1230862	1232684	And then also, just a few things here and there.
1232724	1237248	I checked out Hasbro Family Game Night briefly, which is a little bit, you know, it's a little deceptive.
1237368	1240932	I thought, well, I don't know if I should say deceptive, but it's unlike other games.
1240992	1246917	Because I thought you were going to get all these games, the Kinect 4, the Scrabble, and all this stuff, for $10.
1247238	1248359	No, no.
1248799	1252703	Each of those games within Scrabble, or within Family Game Night, cost $10.
1253263	1254865	Family Game Night is like the front end.
1255285	1255925	Family Game Night
1273635	1274315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1304556	1314503	Now, granted, you know, the Wii version doesn't have internet play, so it kind of depends how much that's worth to you and all that, but it just kind of amuses me that I think a lot of people forget this game's already available on the Wii.
1314563	1322869	It's one big bundle, so something to consider if you're going to get all these games or if you think this is something that might be for you because you have a family.
1322929	1329373	You know, there's already a version out there on the Wii that's probably going to be in the bargain bin before too long that might suit you better.
1329593	1331655	But, of course, online play goes a long way.
1331795	1332355	I get that.
1332896	1333236	There you go.
1334195	1335616	I checked out the demo for Uno Rush.
1335756	1336477	I didn't like it at all.
1336917	1339960	I didn't like the way the game runs at all.
1340420	1341982	It's not the video game itself.
1342062	1343383	It's not the way it was ported.
1343443	1345105	I don't like the game itself.
1345265	1348167	I don't like the whole organizing your cards as the game goes on.
1348988	1359277	And plus, I don't think it's worth the five extra dollars that they want to charge for that as opposed to the five dollars for regular Uno, which seems to be a more accepted price point and sadly one that we rarely see anymore.
1359437	1361018	Yeah, Uno's so a few years ago.
1363780	1365061	Some comments from chat room.
1365101	1368404	Leo Shen says, Hardcore Xbox Kinect fucking 4 is worth $10.
1368464	1369425	Drop your piece, bitch.
1369725	1371146	Pretty sneaky there, you bitch.
1372447	1373428	I guess that could be worth it.
1373468	1373788	I don't know.
1373808	1375470	I just think it would get a little old after a while.
1376190	1377091	But then again, you know what?
1377171	1380433	How can I say Uno's great and then say these games are not great?
1381214	1383296	The only difference really is five more dollars.
1383336	1386518	And these games graphically are a little more polished, the ones in Family Game Night.
1386558	1387379	So, you know...
1390556	1392637	GameGuru says you might pick it up when it's in the bargain bin.
1393178	1393518	Perhaps.
1395739	1397120	That's about it for my gaming week.
1397460	1399181	I did check out a lot of little things here and there.
1400262	1402903	I didn't play a lot of games for a long, long time.
1403063	1403884	That's the weird thing.
1404104	1405285	I played a lot of games here and there.
1405545	1407626	Probably Retro Game Challenge is the one I played the most.
1407646	1408487	Because I've unlocked like...
1409537	1410377	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1430245	1431246	Several of us put OLR on there
1445182	1446043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1471024	1471985	MySpace, Customizable Backgrounds
1496108	1508537	and then the other thing LiveJournal is also our community at Orange Lounge which we haven't posted a lot to lately but we try to you know especially as our listeners and stuff post things there we always read that and keep an eye on that so okay
1510514	1515618	Also, oh yeah, Deekman reminds us, hey, there's that little box called Extended Play on the OLR homepage, and it has it all.
1515638	1518020	It has like our Last.fm group, our Steam community.
1518340	1527887	If you want to find some like-minded gamers, cool people who listen to a little internet radio program out of someone's garage, then check it out on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1528128	1535353	Alright, let's get into some gaming news, because damn, a lot happened this week, and that might be thanks to a little thing called the Game Developers Conference, which might I remind you is not E3.
1536474	1537715	Loki's gonna start us off tonight.
1554511	1569594	Yes, there is a new, I'm not even sure if you'd call it a console format, I guess, on live, which is going to basically be almost like, I guess, those TiVo boxes that you can get where you can stream videos to your home.
1570114	1577676	This service, you'll actually be able to stream games to your home, and it'll also be like a really small box that you would put next to your TV.
1578436	1580197	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1607632	1636245	But something you would hook up to your TV And I think I remember saying a long time ago And I don't even know if it was when we interviewed the guy from GameTap That was a long time ago But I remember we were talking about, you know, GameTap should be something you can plug into your TV And this thing would sell like crazy And this sounds like it This might as well be like an extension of GameTap Or just rename it to GameTap and just have like Well, the same people are involved, so they can't really do that Well, damn, just talk to, hey, okay, you got the technology Go make friends You've got the technology, they've got the name, and you know
1637011	1637471	Let's do it.
1637752	1641956	Not only do we get the high-end PC games, let's get the retro stuff.
1642156	1642877	Just have everything.
1643277	1645479	The streaming frame skipping is weird to me.
1646160	1646520	Here's the thing.
1646540	1651865	The way GameTap works, you download the whole game to your computer and then play it that way.
1652526	1653547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1673960	1680507	I can't imagine that this is really going to work unless they have one hell of an algorithm to basically do this.
1680527	1685993	Because the way I see it, you're going to need a PC for every one of these things that are going.
1687334	1691439	So each person is going to need their own PC basically in this remote server to be able to play this stuff.
1691459	1694081	But this does not hook up to your TV?
1694952	1703103	No, I mean, well, it does hook up to your TV, but it's, I mean, you don't need your own PC, your own high-end PC to run this stuff.
1703284	1703484	Okay.
1703804	1711695	Which I think you should, because, you know, half the fun of actually being able to play these games is the effort that it takes to own a PC or build a PC to do it.
1712256	1715119	But whatever, I mean... In your hacking and cracking opinion.
1715179	1716500	Well, not really.
1717601	1722245	Because I'd be pissed off if I streamed Crisis got to the end and couldn't finish it because the game was broken.
1722265	1723086	Wait, but this is a huge thing.
1723847	1726429	You hook this box into your TV, correct?
1726489	1726710	Yes.
1726890	1729252	So you don't need a computer at all or a monitor.
1729432	1730433	You don't need a computer monitor.
1730453	1730994	That's important.
1731534	1732115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1748956	1749497	It looks neat.
1749517	1751098	Some of the other cool features on there.
1751118	1754360	They're going to have a way you can share videos.
1754660	1756462	They call them brag clips.
1756602	1761185	No real gamer score, obviously, but you'll have your own profile.
1761245	1762786	You can buy or rent the game.
1763406	1766549	You can demo it before you buy it, obviously.
1767970	1768790	Lots of cool stuff.
1771152	1771432	I don't know.
1771472	1772253	It's a neat idea.
1772453	1774134	If they can get it to work, that'd be really cool.
1775367	1782592	The problem is I don't know if they're going to be able to get it to work like they want to, but I think there are other applications for it if this doesn't end up working out.
1783773	1793059	I'm very curious to see what's going to happen at E3, because they're going to probably have to show a little more at E3, and there's going to be a much bigger audience of people watching them at E3.
1793499	1796581	I'm kind of curious to see how it really flows.
1796681	1800404	But my thing is, if they can get it to work...
1801417	1812259	with this little stupid box and stream it, what's gonna say, you know, stop, like, Sony or Microsoft from streaming a game, you know, a full game over their service?
1812599	1815519	Isn't this the direction we've all seen them moving in anyway?
1815639	1815899	Yeah.
1816420	1818600	I mean, is this really any surprise?
1818680	1828722	I mean, Microsoft and Sony have slowly been walking this direction anyway, especially now that Sony offers their old school catalog as download titles to the TV and the PSP.
1828762	1828902	But,
1830962	1834086	and now you can buy Burnout Paradise online completely.
1834286	1841073	Yeah, but I think this would be even better though because for a console manufacturer, they've already got the console to crunch everything.
1841433	1844456	It wouldn't necessarily be all on a remote server
1845475	1845956	DarkSakura.com
1864335	1864615	I don't know.
1864635	1865155	It'll be interesting.
1894862	1903410	All right, well, talking about other things that came out of Game Developers Conference, a lot of talk about digital rights management.
1903710	1907514	And one of the big companies, of course, behind DRM is Steam.
1907994	1914580	Steamworks is a new kind of thing that Valve is putting together, and they're talking about how it's going to make DRM obsolete.
1915140	1919064	Apparently, Steamworks has this new anti-piracy technology that involves copyrights.
1919244	1920425	Thank you for watching!
1944611	1946811	It's your customized copy.
1947292	1951532	So if suddenly your copy were to show up on a torrent, everybody would know who did it.
1952853	1953333	Interesting.
1953973	1956773	Kind of surprised a technique like this hasn't been thought of a long time ago.
1957013	1963915	But my thought is, wouldn't the hackers figure out a way to take the information out of the EXE or block it or scramble it?
1963935	1965695	Or figure out how to sign it themselves.
1965935	1966855	It's not going to work.
1967896	1970016	It's a good attempt, but it's not going to work.
1972250	1975111	Well, you know, where there's a will, there's a way.
1975471	1978032	Pirates are going to hack everything.
1978052	1982554	Did they say that this way is that it will end piracy, basically?
1982714	1987056	I don't think anybody's going to make those bold statements anymore, but they did say it will make DRM obsolete.
1987136	1987837	That they did claim.
1989437	1993039	Okay, well maybe that's not so bad, but I don't know.
1993789	2003537	I still think that even if they don't even care about the subject matter being put out I'm sorry the hacking community likes a good challenge
2005014	2008497	TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, says it's called a watermark.
2009238	2010860	Which, you know, you think of like a picture.
2011320	2013322	You know, sometimes if you have a picture on a website.
2013502	2015364	Like, gaming websites do this crap all the time.
2015664	2025233	Like, for instance, a company like IGN might find a logo for a brand new Wii game on some piddly little independent radio site and copy it.
2025313	2029097	And then they'll put their watermark on it when they put it on their own website.
2029477	2036740	So that, you know, everybody knows that when they get it from the bigger, bigger website with all the bandwidth, that it came from IGN, which may or may not be true.
2036960	2037300	Correct?
2037700	2038600	Is that a good analogy?
2038620	2039921	That is a pretty good analogy, I think.
2040361	2053246	Well, it could also, and this is actually speaking of the same situation, what we should be doing is going in Photoshop and adding in the image information details as far as when it was taken, where it came from, that type of thing.
2053826	2062954	you know embed all that data within the file where you don't actually need the watermark I'm actually thinking that that could be something more like what they're going to do actually have something
2064145	2080698	Not necessarily overt, like, you know, a watermark, like you're saying, but something that's embedded deep into the code, or maybe even some little difference in a code, like a different color on a shirt or something for a particular character.
2080718	2083700	They know they look for that character, that shirt's a different color, that's your copy.
2084561	2091686	You know, a series of randomly generated events, though, that will identify it, but not be immediately perceived.
2091866	2096568	Yeah, I was going to say, if they want to be smart about this, they're not going to put the information out there in the open.
2096668	2104011	The subtle watermark will be something like a particular pattern that appears or a picture that shows up somewhere.
2104612	2109134	It's going to take a while for the pirates to figure out what is being watermarked.
2109654	2113536	I think if you just cram name and number in the file, that's not going to be enough.
2113776	2118058	And if they're not doing it that way, that idea is copyright 2009 Jamie.
2120979	2121359	That's right.
2121399	2121919	DarkSakura.
2122039	2123580	Put a little watermark on it right now.
2124180	2125381	I'm saying right now that's my idea.
2125841	2126181	Don't steal it.
2128322	2129702	That's a very interesting way around it though.
2129742	2130242	So there you go.
2131903	2132923	We'll see what happens with this.
2133283	2136324	Obviously Steam has a lot of power so far, I suppose you could say.
2137225	2143227	So it'll be interesting to see kind of the impact that this ultimately has on the PC gaming and the PC piracy scene.
2144042	2150204	Well, in other PC news and piracy, God, this is going to make it so easy for the pirates, but who cares?
2152945	2154945	Sims 3 is not going to use the DRM.
2155846	2161447	It's actually going to just use a key code, a CD key.
2161928	2163408	That'll be broken in about five seconds.
2163588	2163868	I know.
2164568	2169050	But then again, it's seriously, with as many people complaining about DRM,
2171012	2179861	That's really going to be the best way, I think, right now to at least please some of the players.
2181803	2184486	Although I love what the guy said about it.
2184766	2185928	There's a quote from...
2189331	2191692	I'm trying to see who the person is.
2193513	2208761	Rod Humble who is the executive producer saying we feel that this is a good time proven solution which makes it easy for you to play the game without DRM methods that feel overly invasive or leave you concerned about authorization server access in the distant future.
2211042	2212423	I agree to that extent.
2212943	2215765	You won't have to worry about being authorized every time you play it.
2216265	2217946	You won't have to worry about
2218655	2247348	you know having to be online to play it but at the same time it is going to mean that they're going to find a lot more I suppose hacked versions out there you know that people are going to be breaking those codes that's good I didn't want to buy that game anyways I'm buying it I need to make more houses need to burn more people need to drown more people in the pool and then turn the lawn into a graveyard that's even better
2247682	2267172	and then the people who move in are like haunted there needs to be more vampires in Sims 3 and aliens and mutant powers so it'll be Sims X3 okay but not a crappy sequel like X3 was dear god no
2270215	2272417	Anyways, there's some pretty interesting stuff.
2272458	2285149	I mean, we've already seen this with the Xbox 360, but now Netflix is kind of branching out to other game systems to see, you know, maybe there's potential interest in streaming to theirs.
2285750	2287191	For example, the PlayStation 3.
2287251	2294318	There was a survey going around asking people if they'd be interested in something like
2294878	2299081	Like the service that they have right now on the Xbox 360 on the PlayStation 3.
2299581	2300902	However, it would be a little bit different.
2301322	2307827	What would happen is you'd actually have to purchase a Netflix Instant Streaming Disk for a one-time fee of $10.
2307987	2314551	And so this can be put into your drive and then basically install their run off there.
2315012	2321716	And then you have to connect your PS3 to the internet and you'd be able to stream all sorts of stuff to it.
2322116	2322837	All different movies.
2325078	2329160	Could this perhaps mean that we're going to see Netflix coming to other systems?
2329901	2330181	Maybe?
2330661	2330961	I don't know.
2332082	2334824	I think they're going to go where the money is, so why not?
2336625	2336905	Huh.
2337865	2344729	It's just interesting, though, because I think in our minds we all assume that PlayStation 3 will go with a competitor, like Blockbuster or something else.
2345229	2351773	So it's kind of interesting that Netflix could essentially end up having a monopoly pretty soon on the high-end systems.
2352469	2354110	Netflix Instant Streaming Disk
2382586	2410266	apparently this would be a disc that you would put in the Wii when you want to use the Netflix streaming service and it's not something that would come automatically with a firmware update so I'm not sure if you have to buy this for a fee or if it would be very low cost or something you could order from Netflix no idea very interesting to see if this would actually be something that would happen oh no I'm sorry I'm looking at it in the survey it says a one time fee of $10 for the Netflix instant streaming disc and then your Wii would be connected to the internet
2412307	2420910	So it could be that Netflix could automatically show up on the Wii, the PS3, and the Xbox 360 all at once, and they would kind of dominate the streaming video market.
2421270	2423271	I don't know if this would necessarily be a bad thing.
2423391	2427133	I mean, you know, Netflix has a pretty big library, but of course a little competition is healthy too.
2427613	2430514	One thing I think Netflix suffers from is they don't have a lot of...
2430974	2432876	Big, big stuff in their streaming library.
2432916	2450837	And I know they've talked about adding stuff later on for a higher fee, but they don't get a lot of brand new stuff if it's not an obscure indie film or a documentary, which don't get me wrong, those aren't necessarily bad, but some days you want to watch the big action shoot them up too, and those things are never available instantly, right away, for many, many, many years.
2451778	2480582	so, I don't know I think a little competition would be healthy if one of the other services would get involved at the same time if Netflix hopefully can get some of the newer stuff on their service, it could be pretty awesome so, we'll see we'll see if this survey, of course surveys can sometimes be meaningless, it's just a survey don't take it too seriously who knows well, how about something a little different more stuff out of Game Developers Conference
2481713	2482213	Yay!
2483394	2485576	The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks.
2486137	2488278	It's sort of what makes me think of ice cream.
2489339	2491461	You know, what's the one Moose Tracks?
2493082	2495084	I want ice cream, I think.
2495724	2496825	Ice cream sounds delicious.
2496905	2497946	Dude, ice cream is fantastic.
2498006	2501469	I have one ice cream cone in the house and I'm so eating it during break.
2501509	2502509	Don't hate me.
2504265	2505126	Only if you buy me pie.
2505426	2505726	We'll see.
2535037	2538500	Is it supposed to be some type of training game?
2538740	2541202	He's got a freaking train!
2541342	2543704	Haven't they called this a rail shooter game or something?
2544685	2548148	No, it's Link on a Train.
2549729	2550169	Seriously.
2550249	2551971	It's just going to be a standard Zelda game.
2552031	2556975	It's just people are basing their information off of what they see in the trailer and speculating.
2557535	2558996	It's just, okay, now there's no water.
2559016	2561939	But he's wearing a conductor's outfit in every darn scene you see him in.
2562304	2563485	Maybe he likes it.
2563605	2565866	Maybe it makes him feel sexy inside.
2565926	2566407	I don't know.
2568768	2573051	Maybe he's worn out the... I think Frisbee in chat sums it up.
2573111	2575752	He's queuing up a song that would describe this game.
2576132	2578554	Come on, ride the train and ride it.
2578774	2579995	That should be the song they use in the trailer.
2580075	2581536	I was thinking of Snakes on a Train.
2582696	2583997	Or Snakes on a Train.
2584618	2585398	Snakes on a Train.
2585458	2587539	Wasn't that a direct-to-DVD version or something like that?
2587559	2589500	It was a knock-off video.
2591402	2591862	Alright, well...
2592766	2593126	I don't know.
2593466	2594346	I guess more to come on this.
2594406	2595166	Probably at E3.
2595246	2596747	I'm assuming this is going to be playable at E3.
2596787	2597707	We'll find out more about this.
2598407	2600547	I guess it's inevitable there's going to be a new Zelda game.
2600587	2603668	Where there's a Nintendo conference, when they're hurting, there's a new Zelda game, right?
2604148	2605428	I don't know.
2606488	2606688	Yeah.
2607269	2617330	So, along with that, of course, we have a little bit more Zelda information, including another Zelda coming to Virtual Console in Japan.
2617470	2620111	But, you know, it's going to be coming everywhere else eventually, I'm sure.
2620791	2620871	Um...
2622037	2627621	Actually, in April, we're going to be getting Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask on Virtual Console.
2627821	2631724	Also expected out on the Sega Master System, Phantasy Star.
2632844	2635126	For the PC Engine, Ninja Gaiden.
2637147	2644332	Also part of the Virtual Console Arcade, Genpai Termidon and Space Invaders.
2645493	2647594	And then for the Super Famicom, Kirby's Dream Land 3.
2649296	2651097	And let's see here.
2653448	2655308	and then Castlevania 3 on the Famicom.
2656669	2658089	So that's kind of cool.
2658109	2661530	But I'm sure we'll see stuff in other regions probably around the same time.
2661610	2664830	I do want to point out though, Phantasy Star is in that Ultimate Genesis collection.
2664930	2667231	You can get all of them for like $30.
2667731	2674512	I would never pay $5 for just Phantasy Star when I know this is out there with all the Phantasy Star games for like $30.
2675653	2676113	Just saying.
2678533	2681634	Well, their prices are a little high anyways if you ask me.
2682955	2695720	Anyhow, look, one thing that always kind of pissed me off about virtual consoles is that there was no place on the damn Wii to store all these virtual console games that sometimes I want to download, and especially add WiiWare into it, and the storage capacity on the Wii stinks.
2696060	2708224	And you might remember, people have been bitching about this for a long time, and what was it, last, like, frickin' September or October, this guy that worked for Nintendo came out and said, nobody cares about that, just geeks and otaku are the only people that care about this.
2708244	2709625	And I said, F you, buddy!
2710585	2710806	May I?
2710846	2711026	What?
2711947	2712367	Yeah.
2712407	2713448	I said, F you, buddy.
2713789	2717773	If that's going to be your attitude, then I ban myself from Virtual Console.
2717793	2719034	I'm not downloading any more stuff.
2719254	2722918	Because I'll tell you what, I had like three screens full of Virtual Console crap before that point.
2722938	2724139	I don't know how I fit it all in there.
2724620	2725901	Mostly little NES games.
2726241	2727703	I said, the hell with this.
2727783	2732488	If that's going to be your attitude, then I ban Virtual Console until Nintendo addresses this issue.
2732528	2733068	And guess what?
2734011	2754350	Finally, all these months later, yes, my boycott has come to an end because they did announce at Game Developers Conference 2009 that the Wii Shop channel would be updated with the SD card menu that would allow you 20 pages of games on the SD card without having to copy it back and forth like you did before.
2754390	2756972	You could actually boot the damn game from the SD card.
2757673	2759355	Not necessarily, though.
2760516	2761196	Also, let me say this.
2761256	2767582	Not just can you do 2GB SD cards, which is a lot of room to begin with, especially compared to what's on the Wii to begin with.
2767862	2771165	You can now run up to 32GB SD cards in the slot.
2771405	2772987	Loki, what were you going to say?
2773107	2776330	Technically, it's not necessarily running off the SD card.
2776430	2778231	It's copying them to the Wii memory.
2778291	2780874	So that is one little asterisk on there.
2780954	2785578	You need to have free memory on your Wii's internal storage.
2786078	2791640	However, though, if you get an SD card that's big enough, just copy everything to the damn SD card, at least all the games.
2792220	2793441	Save files, I'm sure, will be enough.
2793561	2798823	But it alleviates the problem of having to go into the memory manager every single time, which was stupid.
2798863	2801604	And I know a lot of people were emailing me saying, Rob, you should just copy things.
2801884	2805745	I said, no, no, that's stupid because it needs to be part of this whole seamless thing.
2805805	2814048	You're making excuses for Nintendo having these big ideas with what they want to do with the download service and then not having the space to put it all.
2814128	2815129	I said, you're making excuses.
2815689	2819330	So Nintendo needs to address this directly, make it very seamless, make it easy.
2819771	2820551	And they finally did.
2820851	2821431	So there you go.
2822012	2825533	And so, of course, if you were listening early in the show, I talked about I played Bit.Trip.Beat.
2825573	2826954	I also played Gradius Rebirth.
2826974	2827694	I didn't play it enough.
2828074	2833756	I went on a buying binge to buy some of the things I missed out on while my boycott was going on.
2833856	2835097	So there you go.
2835936	2837096	That happens from time to time?
2837717	2838037	Sorry.
2838677	2839097	What is this?
2839597	2840938	You're talking about your video, right?
2841238	2845500	Yeah, sometimes when you punch somebody, they bounce back and they knock you open to the air.
2846360	2846960	Anyways, sorry.
2847200	2847880	Back to the show.
2848060	2852022	And DarkTatooine in chat says, as long as you leave enough to load your biggest VC game should be an issue.
2852042	2852342	You're right.
2852622	2857004	But all I do, I copy all my games to the SD card now and I'll have plenty of room on the...
2857944	2858504	The Wii.
2888186	2889027	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2907887	2915070	We specifically asked, did Nintendo's announcements at Game Developers Conference show a commitment to us core gamers or are you not satisfied?
2915110	2919332	Here's some of the answers we got on Twitter, which is a little bit diverse here.
2921812	2928677	Let's see, we've got... Poor Leno111 says, To me, the train plus Zelda equals fail.
2928737	2931078	I wish they would just go back to the old school style of Zelda.
2932259	2935801	Ryan Belknap says, Just should be happy they said anything at all.
2935821	2937002	They could have kept it for E3.
2937783	2943226	Dustoise says, With the new games and support for bigger SD card, I think it's a great move, but I know tons of people will still complain.
2944027	2948050	Scruffy K says, No, I think Nintendo is trying to keep the core gamers from deserting them.
2948410	2950731	A Zelda in the hands is good as two in production.
2952032	2952613	There you go.
2974785	2977449	Some of the answers from our Show Us Your Tweets segment.
2977529	2982275	We're on twitter.com under OLR, and we like to post questions for you guys to answer before the show.
2983757	2984157	Let's move on.
2984177	2989004	We do have a couple more Nintendo stories out of Game Developers Conference.
2989024	2989805	I almost said E3.
2993311	2996738	We're a little bit stuck right now though, so why don't I go ahead and just take this next one?
2997078	2997279	Okay.
2997519	3002188	Okay, so the next story would be about... Sorry, we got some live issues going on.
3002248	3002689	Live radio, folks.
3002709	3004954	It's called Jamie's Computer is a Piece of Crap.
3005697	3006077	That's all right.
3006097	3014479	Well, Jamie would have been excited to tell you about the Virtual Console Arcade that was also announced at Game Developers Conference and is now just loading?
3014499	3015059	Now just loading.
3015079	3018140	Well, then tell them what arcade games they can be looking forward to with this.
3018180	3021680	Well, hey, there's all kinds of cool stuff that you can be looking forward to.
3022901	3029962	In fact, I would actually even say if you were a Namco fan, then you're going to be supremely pleased.
3030512	3031093	GAPLESS MAPPY
3050976	3051756	We Love Mappy!
3052377	3053818	Annoying little freaking game that is.
3054778	3055258	It's alright.
3055278	3056659	500 Wii Points.
3056759	3062382	There's Tower of Druaga, which is 500 Wii Points, also available now.
3062442	3064883	Star Force from Tecmo.
3065103	3065363	500 points.
3065443	3070146	And then we have a Sega game coming out, which is my number three favorite game.
3071026	3071347	Ever.
3071907	3072227	Ever.
3072727	3073528	Space Harrier.
3074008	3074448	Hi!
3075929	3079931	And then Solvalu from Namco Bondi.
3081610	3089538	Again, though, I'm a little torn because didn't a lot of these Namco games show up in these various Namco collections they seem to put out on every system?
3089658	3090279	Some have not.
3090859	3091360	Some have not.
3091500	3091920	Some have not.
3091960	3101450	And also, other ones that are listed on here, where we're not seeing any too much else listed in the announcement list, was Emeralda.
3102851	3104673	There's also The Return of Ishtar.
3105314	3105494	Hmm.
3106034	3107715	So, hey.
3107795	3108855	Here's the mistake I don't want to make.
3108915	3110836	It's very similar to the Sonic Genesis collection.
3110956	3117380	I'm pretty sure I heard something about Namco's putting out some type of new compilation on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3117440	3119080	There's a new thing coming out for that.
3119421	3134928	So, if that is going to have Mappy and some of these games in it, when that collection is going to be $30, maybe $40 tops, why would I buy one game for 500 points when this is likely to... And again, I don't know a lot about it, but I think I heard there's one being developed...
3136789	3137350	Why would I do that?
3138410	3142414	Why wouldn't I just go buy the PS3 one just like I would say go buy the Sonic Genesis Collection?
3142954	3147177	I would actually buy individual games on here because I don't know if you remember.
3147237	3148398	This is an old example.
3148758	3156444	You remember when I was scrambling like a chicken with a head cut off to try to find the entire Namco PlayStation series?
3157265	3159306	And I think I'm like missing the O.
3160387	3163870	So I have some of the rare ones, and I was also looking for the trademark symbol that was only on Japan.
3164031	3165252	Or the restricted symbol, or whatever.
3166533	3171117	But there's games on those compilations that I wanted that we didn't get on the US versions, you know.
3171758	3177844	And it would be far cheaper for me to have my compilation and then just get the couple of them that I don't have.
3178704	3181907	You know, so like for Tower of Druaga, you know.
3182568	3184250	True, I have that on the PlayStation 1, but...
3187352	3192519	It's not always convenient to hook up my PlayStation or deal with backwards compatibility or any of that.
3192992	3193613	I can see that.
3193773	3194233	I can see that.
3194273	3201559	And you know, something like Space Harrier, as much as you love that game, I can see why you would want to get that.
3201939	3206123	I seriously can name off multiple versions of Space Harrier that I have.
3206383	3207324	And what's one more?
3207404	3211907	I've got it on Saturn, I have it on PC Engine, I've got it on 32X.
3212048	3213529	Okay, it's only a three hour show.
3214590	3216491	The 32X version is arcade perfect, by the way.
3216571	3219794	You can actually change it into Insert Coin instead of Press Start.
3220114	3220334	Nice.
3221736	3227583	But I was going to say, you know, and I think one thing that I don't believe made our show roll tonight is about the Final Fantasy games.
3227643	3230907	All the old ones are going to be, were officially announced that they're coming to Virtual Console.
3231568	3235833	I'll pay the money for Final Fantasy 4 and 6 again, even though I already own those games.
3236654	3239137	I own 6, the cartridge somewhere, and I own 4.
3240999	3268032	Final Fantasy 5 I got 4 on the Wonderswan Color of all things I've got 4 on the DS I'll buy it again on Super Nintendo that's how much I fucking love that game especially if they release although I have a feeling we're going to get the Bastard Eyes 2 that was the first release here because it is a virtual console but especially if we got the Japanese re-translation oh my god I'd be so excited if I had a perfect translation of Final Fantasy 3
3269401	3275363	I would be freaking in heaven, but you know what game that I totally wish that they would bring out, translated, is Seiken Densetsu 3.
3276743	3285225	Hi people, there is an officially, there's a fully sprite hacked everything translated version out there, just say, let us use that please.
3286765	3290726	Or just fucking use it because it was your game in the first place, you know what I mean?
3290766	3292647	I think they would have every right to just use it.
3294047	3295428	What could the translators do?
3295808	3303310	Geez, sorry we copied your game and ROM dumped it and then translated it and released it to the entirety of the internet, right?
3303770	3306891	That would totally not get Nintendo any friends.
3307852	3308692	Well, but still.
3309992	3313293	But still, my point is there that it exists.
3313493	3315094	People did this in their spare time.
3315434	3318455	Why can't Nintendo pay someone and just crank it out?
3321036	3321596	Pay them a dollar.
3321796	3322076	Yeah.
3322750	3324894	I don't think we'll see that ever.
3325756	3328401	Well, we may eventually see it, but it won't be for a while.
3328421	3328721	Never say never.
3328781	3331407	We did get Final Fantasy V. We did get Final Fantasy III.
3332802	3333903	That's true.
3334263	3334804	Eventually.
3335144	3336485	I actually have that game on Famicom.
3336665	3338126	Never say never with Second Detsetsu.
3338386	3338927	Never say never.
3339747	3343150	And that could be a thing that they would be holding back for E3.
3343350	3349675	But, you know, I don't want to get anyone's hopes up and I doubt it, but, you know, you never know.
3349875	3356821	That and Earthbound are like the two things they could pull out of their pants and lay on the table and they would just like, oh my god, Phantasm.
3357281	3358042	Either one of those things.
3358322	3359803	Seriously, it would be so much wank.
3360784	3361184	For real.
3361444	3361745	For real.
3362887	3371510	Speaking of so much wank, there's another game that will not be coming to a Nintendo console soon, at least not through legitimate means.
3372050	3379013	But now, thanks to a coding competition, there is a new application, Kama Sutra, for the DS.
3379753	3388536	Yes, with this, you can actually see visual representations of all the different Kama Sutra positions and can learn about the pros and cons of them.
3389196	3390377	No, they'll release it in the States.
3390397	3391657	They'll just call it Sex Training.
3392253	3394636	Yes, my personal trainer, Kama Sutra.
3395376	3398259	They'll just rename it Yoga for Adults.
3398560	3399921	My personal trainer, ButtSex.
3400021	3402444	Wait, is the gay Kama Sutra part of this?
3403145	3403945	I don't know.
3404666	3405287	I haven't downloaded it.
3405307	3408250	I just haven't gotten a chance to load it on my card yet.
3408310	3413776	There's actually some other neat things that came out, but I can't remember what they were for the coding competition.
3416172	3422096	Robert M in chat is kind of referencing our last little bit there where we were talking about Earthbound and how it would just become fanboy wank all over the places.
3422116	3423036	That was announced for E3.
3423376	3429400	And Robert M says, True.
3429660	3432841	And Bobby did make a very good point, and I'm not going to deny that.
3432921	3438124	There's a lot of shit they got away with 15 years ago they probably couldn't get away with now, especially with Wii getting sued as much as it does.
3438544	3438945	However...
3439705	3455211	If they wanted to take the time to go back and recode some things and redo some things, which wouldn't be that much time at all, considering how much this would sell, and then just kind of not tell people that when they announce Earthbound, that they, oh yeah, and we changed it a lot, they'll still be wank all over the place.
3455231	3458112	They did the same thing with... Tecmo Bowl.
3458192	3459392	Wave Race 64.
3459612	3462213	Yeah, I mean, it's not unheard of for them to change games.
3462573	3464274	Granted, there'd be a lot to change.
3465066	3468648	But they could do it and probably make a killing on Virtual Console.
3468708	3472850	They just wouldn't advertise that they went back and changed stuff because all the purists would be up in arms.
3473370	3475071	But it's better than nothing.
3475871	3476211	Right?
3476231	3478492	The purists would be up in arms anyway.
3478512	3479093	And you know what?
3479273	3480613	To hell with it as long as we get it.
3481434	3481774	We'll see.
3482534	3484695	It depends how much they mess with it for me.
3485076	3485456	But we'll see.
3486516	3488437	More stuff out of Game Developer Conference.
3488657	3490178	And this is also from Nintendo.
3490198	3492019	A game called Rock and Roll Climber.
3493263	3494684	Rock'n'Roll Racing or Snake'n'Roll
3510784	3511985	No, this is a whole new game.
3512085	3512805	Whole new IP.
3512925	3514347	So props to them for doing a new IP.
3514387	3516448	But it's called Rock and Roll Climber.
3516509	3521633	It's a balance board game that you use the balance board and the Wiimote and Nunchuck.
3521673	3524095	And you do these arm movements to climb up a wall.
3524375	3526077	The balance board reads your leg movements.
3526117	3529480	The Wiimote and Nunchuck read your arm movements.
3529900	3531621	And apparently, here's the weird thing.
3532002	3535044	Once you get to the top, you get a guitar and you play a riff.
3536047	3541009	So, I'm assuming there's some type of music fusion with this game.
3541369	3542969	I know they didn't say a lot at GDC.
3543029	3545030	Maybe this is one of the things they're going to be showing more at E3.
3545370	3550672	But I imagine they're incorporating, I mean, to call the game Rock and Roll Climber, they're probably incorporating music into this.
3550732	3553233	Now, maybe it's that you have to climb on beat or something like that.
3553373	3553653	I don't know.
3553673	3554293	It could be anything.
3554733	3555593	But I'm sure we'll see more of this.
3555613	3556334	You just have to wail hard.
3556834	3557354	That's right.
3557614	3559114	Just flail about aimlessly.
3559915	3561515	No, but I'm sure there's some type of rhythm.
3561875	3563176	I'm still waiting for Air Guitar Hero.
3563216	3563816	We just don't know.
3565029	3567732	They have an air guitar mode in Guitar Hero.
3568433	3570916	It's actually an air guitar machine that you can use live.
3570936	3572458	It just takes away the instruments that they have.
3574300	3574881	Anyhow, there you go.
3574921	3579026	Rock and Roll Climber coming out probably this summer or something.
3579606	3581849	I may add it looked like crap last year.
3582333	3586475	Also, and it's a WiiWare title, and it looked like... Oh, I didn't even catch that.
3586495	3587035	It's WiiWare?
3587095	3587635	It's WiiWare.
3587976	3588636	Oh, I didn't catch that.
3588656	3589836	It's absolute crap.
3590076	3590877	Oh, yeah.
3591017	3593818	And everyone's like, oh, maybe it's a sequel to Ice Climber.
3594078	3595559	No, they would never do anything that cool.
3597897	3608444	DarkTetsuya says, Sky, the game kind of gives me a vibe of the old school NES version where it's just cute.
3608484	3610185	Congrats on beating the level animation.
3610285	3610786	Well, maybe.
3611046	3611907	That's basically it.
3611967	3616970	It's just another way to say, look, it's another thing you can use the Wii Fit Board for.
3617030	3620713	You can be fit and climb walls because people like climbing walls.
3620973	3628078	The whole guitar thing sort of really makes me go back to a Strong Bad thing with the cheat.
3628999	3630380	Here, the short have a trophy!
3630660	3635304	I'm sorry, I only want to climb walls if I'm going to be chased by an American Gladiator while I do so.
3635424	3639447	There should be Frank mode where you can climb a curtain and then it falls on you and you die.
3642011	3643633	And if you catch that reference, you're awesome.
3643653	3644954	Yeah, you're super awesome if you catch that reference.
3644974	3646656	I caught that reference and I don't even know what it's from.
3647417	3650179	Well, I do know what it's from, but I've never even seen the source material.
3650340	3651261	Alright, forget it.
3651601	3652041	Let's move on.
3652061	3654364	How about something crazy?
3655785	3659949	And something that we already have in America, but hey, our friends in the UK are finally getting it.
3660130	3663253	You get Dementium where you can be loony.
3665397	3667318	It's actually Dementium the Ward.
3667698	3669078	It's for the DS.
3669258	3672539	It will be out on April 17th, two days before my birthday.
3674460	3676360	But yeah, we've had it since October.
3677141	3678581	And it's been in Japan since summer.
3679141	3692365	But if you want to be in a survival horror game where you can fight spooky monsters in a mental hospital and not know how you got there, get this game.
3694960	3696141	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3722130	3726674	You're so mature.
3727815	3736562	As we hinted earlier, the possible outcome of my console... I may remind you, Rob, this console has died once and come back to life.
3736622	3738804	It's the Jesus console, okay?
3739525	3741026	Did it take you three days to revive it?
3742567	3743828	Yes, it did, actually.
3744429	3744509	Um...
3745543	3755313	But there is some striking questionnaires that have been filled out and people's input put in place.
3756174	3764143	Both Joystick and Engadget have run polls regarding the E74 error, which is, as Microsoft puts it, a general hardware error.
3765922	3768886	General Hardware Error, you say?
3783328	3785069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3811499	3815401	But the E74 errors are not part of that three-year warranty.
3815461	3817002	They're just part of the one-year warranty.
3817402	3829248	Is this a way for Microsoft to get out of warranting those consoles that would normally be under the red ring, but now they have reprogrammed the error display to just do this E74 error instead of the three red lights?
3829848	3832050	Kind of a way to save some money if you think about it.
3832890	3837173	So it's actually the same errors, but displayed a different way.
3837213	3838815	This is all conspiracy, though.
3838875	3840496	Here's my question about the polling.
3840976	3844319	My initial thought when I saw these polls is how accurate is this?
3844499	3848662	To post this on a video game website, have you had this problem, yes or no?
3849003	3854667	How many people are actually going to click yes to that survey as opposed to those that are going to click no because they're pissed off?
3855388	3859331	I think for that reason alone, the statistic is skewed completely.
3859591	3861792	The problem, I think, is... I don't know what the actual statistics are.
3861812	3865293	I do know that there are a lot more of them now than there were before, which is a little kind of, huh, you know...
3880618	3882459	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3904398	3909020	I've actually, you know, most of my consoles have died either with the three rings of death.
3909461	3914263	I've only had one that didn't die that way, and it never actually popped up in error messages because I lost video.
3914303	3916724	So if it did, I would have never known.
3917164	3921546	But I'm not surprised that something like this is going on.
3922547	3923207	But who knows?
3923367	3928610	I mean, this may become the new red ring of death thing, and, you know, now it's the E74 error.
3928750	3932532	And it also could be, you know, a way to say, hey, look, you know, statistics...
3933553	3934275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3940984	3943706	But really, they're just kind of shuffling to the side.
3943926	3944467	That's shady.
3944507	3947289	I hope it's just a conspiracy you're talking about there.
3947610	3949071	TigerClaw in chat makes a good point.
3949111	3952113	Microsoft will have to repair the console with the E74 errors regardless.
3952133	3953555	They don't want to end up with more bad PR.
3953695	3954355	Isn't that true?
3954375	3956237	One way or another, they're going to have to fix them anyway?
3956257	3958539	But these consoles are past... That's the thing, though.
3958679	3969268	They don't have to fix them because there's a three-year warranty on... But if all these consoles start showing up with the E74, aren't they going to... If they're newer consoles or what have you, aren't they going to have to fix them anyway?
3969668	3972930	Well, if they're in the one-year warranty, otherwise you have to pay $100 to fix it.
3973630	3976072	That's where they get you because it's not the three rings.
3976212	3977673	But it would be just like before.
3977773	3981475	They were trying to charge $100 to all these people with the red rings and the internet revolted.
3981595	3982676	Isn't that same thing going to happen?
3982696	3983496	Yeah, but prove it.
3983536	3984317	I mean, that's the thing.
3984357	3986798	They're going to have to prove it that that's actually going on.
3987319	3995344	And I just find it a little shady that there's this error message that has the same description as this other error message that's really bad.
3995744	3998746	It's like, well, it's a general hardware failure.
3999506	4016293	so okay what's that mean you know is it is it has this any different than you know three rings well it's a general heart failure of you know the graphics chip or you know the scalar chip or something else it's like well that's exactly what the other one was so how's this any different oh it's not okay
4017472	4017792	I don't know.
4018052	4019253	I just hope I don't ever get one of these.
4041559	4042519	I don't know.
4058655	4059355	So, I don't know.
4059375	4060516	Makes me think of that 3x3 eyes.
4060776	4061736	Yeah, I think it's different.
4061756	4062296	I think it's different.
4062816	4067517	On the PlayStation 3, Winning Post World is a game coming out from Koei this week on April the 2nd.
4068218	4069758	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
4070178	4073339	Douala Doui, Winning Post World also comes out on the Wii.
4073359	4074379	Whoa, whoa, is that Douala?
4074979	4075619	Yeah, Douala.
4075739	4078800	That's a mascot.
4078900	4080541	Yeah, a little koala bear for their team.
4080581	4081401	I think for the fighters.
4082113	4083795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4101937	4107778	Yeah, I actually, a while back, I had a little keychain thing that someone sent me.
4108279	4109439	So I thought it was cool.
4109739	4110359	It got stolen.
4110959	4111099	Aw.
4112220	4114600	Winning Post World also makes its way to the PlayStation 2.
4114980	4116681	This is hitting multiple systems this week.
4116721	4121522	I'm not exactly sure exactly what... Oh, this is... Oh, it's a horse racing game.
4122614	4124715	I was going to say, is it the same thing as Winning Eleven?
4124955	4125495	But it's not.
4125555	4127376	It's a horse racing game, but it looks pretty intricate.
4127416	4128116	Sakura on horses?
4128136	4129477	That's awesome!
4129557	4130377	Isn't that just Polo?
4131398	4134619	No, that's Croquet on horses.
4134639	4136020	Yeah, that'd be Croquet on horses.
4136060	4137721	That's a very good description of Polo.
4138121	4139261	Croquet on horses.
4140902	4142122	Why is it not more popular here?
4142162	4142883	It sounds kind of awesome.
4159631	4168442	Anyhow, on the Nintendo DS, coming out in Japan on the 2nd of April, Disney Fairies Tinkerbell comes out as well as another Pachislot game from Dorosu.
4169203	4178895	Also, Pro Yaku Famitsu DS 2009 comes out from Bandai Namco, which is yet another baseball game coming out from Namco with little chibi characters in it.
4180156	4189108	On the PlayStation Portable, which is the last system we cover over there, the Legend of Heroes, a lot of them move into price reductions.
4189609	4194536	And that's really it, unless you want to get some new covers for your PS in black, silver, and white.
4194596	4195337	That's really it.
4197027	4204532	So I guess Tinkerbell definitely seems to be one of the highlights on the Japanese release calendar this week.
4204692	4205973	Things look a little better next week though.
4206374	4206974	It's a slow week.
4207755	4208015	Is it?
4208195	4208395	Yes.
4209516	4211677	How about going in another direction?
4212157	4212638	How about it?
4212718	4224686	For our friends in the UK on the 27th we have Battleforge for PC, Don King Boxing so you can have bizarro freaky hair.
4227041	4254084	I guess and then Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time for DS and Wii Goblins 4 for PC Wheelman on PC Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and well this one doesn't have a date on it it might have already come out, Crimecraft also though on April 3rd we get Disgaea DS in the UK Ninja Blade on Xbox 360 and the Nintendo DSi
4255386	4258175	Also a Valkyrie profile, Covenant of the Plume.
4260062	4260403	All right.
4261786	4262907	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4291767	4294469	Oh, you haven't heard of Jumping the Shark yet.
4294849	4296851	Guess what else they trademarked already.
4296991	4297771	Oh, God, what?
4297871	4298932	Crafting Mama.
4299813	4300753	Scrapbooking Mama?
4300993	4302094	No, Crafting Mama.
4302494	4303555	She's going to make crafts.
4303655	4304636	Mama Goes to Michael's?
4305236	4311040	I want to see, like, you know, Paladin Mama or something like that, you know, where Mama's in, like, a role-playing game.
4311060	4312801	I want to see Godzilla vs. Mama.
4313362	4318045	No, no, no, I want to see DM Mama, where she's running the game.
4318525	4322187	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
4322247	4322947	She slays the dragon.
4338433	4345519	Uh, Tokyo Beatdown, a traditional kind of beat-em-up fighting game, or fighting action game.
4346079	4348301	Coming from Atlus for the DS, which is pretty cool.
4348521	4350583	This is good, our music fans will love this.
4351163	4353265	Major Minors Majestic March, coming out on the Wii.
4353305	4356487	You may remember the creators of Parappa the Rapper created this.
4357027	4358388	Oh yes, I do.
4358408	4359069	Yeah, marching.
4359089	4360110	We haven't heard a lot about it since.
4360130	4361851	Marching band game, yeah.
4363112	4363973	Bobby, you listening?
4364233	4365174	It's a marching band game.
4366615	4367675	I was in marching band.
4367696	4370656	Me too, but Bobby still does it, I think, to some extent.
4371037	4377299	No, I know he plays drums in shows and things, mostly like musicals and things like that that come through his town.
4377319	4379039	Actually, if I was still living in Alabama, I'd be in the alumni band.
4379099	4381060	I could swear, and he's going to pop in chat any minute, I'm sure.
4381380	4383221	I could swear he talked about drum corps.
4383261	4385201	He still does stuff now and again with that.
4385761	4387562	And that's kind of marching band.
4388422	4392345	Leisure Suit Larry boxed off his bus coming out on the Xbox 360 and PC.
4393986	4396568	No nudity in that game, so I have no interest in it whatsoever.
4397968	4400290	Don King boxing also coming to the DS.
4400670	4401130	Yippee.
4401771	4406354	Cradle of Rome coming to the Wii, which is another one of those bejeweled knockoffs.
4409576	4410416	Let's see here.
4411057	4411597	And then...
4414446	4414986	Vomit?
4415487	4416607	Like crap.
4416987	4420108	Okay, this is kind of, well, another Dance Dance Revolution game.
4420148	4421829	Disney Grooves, now for the Wii.
4423050	4424890	Haas Party 2 with Disney characters now.
4425191	4427792	This isn't a game, but I thought I'd mention it because it's pretty cool.
4428672	4432674	Mad Catz has a new charging dock coming out that charges two controllers.
4432994	4437156	But what makes it special, though, is it's the Rayman Rabbids charging dock.
4437176	4439196	So there's a Rabbid sitting there yelling at you.
4439216	4442338	Unfortunately, it doesn't make noise because that would be awesome.
4443178	4466557	and then one last game coming out a week from today Rhythm Heaven and of course to tie along with that the Nintendo DSi coming out in black and blue well that's why this is a slow week because you have those two bombshells coming out yes the DSi is going to be pretty big and then yeah that's pretty much it for right now wow
4467727	4469928	Now, of course, us talking about the MAMA games.
4469948	4473710	You spawned everybody in chat talking about MAMA in games.
4473750	4476692	But I think my favorite MAMA game that came out, I mean, we had 2DX MAMA.
4478573	4484116	We have Poppin' Music 18 MAMA, MAMA in Space, Neon MAMA Evangelion.
4484476	4489779	My favorite, though, from GS68, this is definitely my favorite MAMA title, MAMA vs. Capcom.
4491400	4492561	Outrun Online Arcade
4515166	4516287	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4531963	4534745	and Cell Factor Psychokinetic Wars, apparently.
4534765	4537768	I could use a fun, silly little racing game that's not too serious.
4537808	4540470	Like, a lot of the Xbox 360 racing games are too serious for me.
4540550	4541951	I could use a fun, silly little one.
4541991	4544613	There's a bunch of stuff that's listed on here that's supposedly coming out this week.
4544633	4545714	I'm not sure if all this is.
4546154	4547535	Banjo-Tooie, they're saying.
4547555	4548436	I don't know.
4548476	4549336	That sounds kind of weird.
4549857	4552859	I know one of these titles that's on this Kotaku list is not correct.
4552899	4553800	Duke Nukem Trilogy.
4553840	4555201	That's not coming out until September.
4555221	4556502	It's funny.
4556522	4557423	It's coming out April 1st.
4557463	4557863	Yeah, April 1st.
4559537	4560277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4584212	4584552	Except Yaris.
4613223	4615245	DarkSakura What is your classic game of the week?
4639522	4642003	My classic game of the week is Twinbee!
4643903	4649564	Which, of course, we saw a while back when it's labeled as Rainbow Bell.
4650164	4652525	I always remembered it as Twinbee, so whatever.
4652545	4656506	Is that familiar?
4658486	4663427	Anybody that's played the Bomani games long enough has heard some form of the Twinbee theme in the game.
4665051	4672998	This is the thing that annoys me about Twinbee, is that every time you get a damn power-up, it plays that little noise and starts the music over.
4673458	4682966	But anyway, Twinbee is a game where you play as a little ship with arms, and you shoot bells for your power-ups, and you change the color of your bell.
4684007	4688550	Actually, they pop out of the clouds, and you shoot the clouds, and the bells will change color, and you'll get a different power-up.
4689551	4692354	But you just have to keep shooting it until you...
4694495	4696557	until you get the one that you want.
4696597	4699819	But if you keep shooting it, it'll change into a symbol that will kill you.
4701974	4705976	So you can play as... You've got two characters in here you can play as.
4706837	4709659	And it came out for the Famicom.
4710219	4712240	It came out actually in the cartridge and disc format.
4712761	4714782	The MSX came out.
4714882	4717063	It was, of course, arcade.
4717904	4726129	And then we also saw it twin be portable for the Sony PSP and the Konami Classic Series arcade hits for the Nintendo DS.
4726929	4735914	Now, I bring up Twinbee because Twinbee leads to actually the one that I like better than this.
4736054	4737334	Can I say this though in chat real quick?
4737354	4739095	We have somebody saying, isn't this Stinger?
4739996	4740896	Yes, we got it as Stinger.
4741416	4742937	So in the US it was called Stinger.
4742957	4745839	Yeah, in the US it was Stinger.
4746319	4748740	But now let's move forward.
4749480	4751061	Sure, let me queue up the other game here.
4751541	4752402	Tell them a little bit about this.
4753024	4762399	The other game, now this is the one that I like better and one that my husband and I played the crap out of last night, is Detona Twinbee, which is...
4764963	4767765	They actually came out in Europe as Bells and Whistles.
4768265	4781693	So, anyway, um, this is a sequel to the original Twinbeat, um, but the arcade and Famiclone versions, and it plays pretty much the same, but it has much, much better graphics and music in Project NC.
4782573	4784674	Um... Yeah, I've never seen this game before.
4784694	4785655	This looks pretty sweet.
4785935	4789197	For an old-school, like, you know, 16-bit era game, this is pretty sweet.
4789881	4795684	It also had little cutscenes that were in between levels where you could see different characters hanging around.
4796345	4799306	Actually, one person plays as Twinbee, the other one plays as Winbee.
4800127	4809212	And you can also get a ghost pilot, which was... Oh, God, now I can't remember what it was called.
4809632	4812374	Because it's definitely not in the article I'm looking at, but the green one?
4812614	4814095	Do you know what the green one is?
4814295	4816197	No, I never played this game.
4816638	4820081	Anyway, you can also get a sort of ghost pilot that will hang out with you.
4823444	4826688	And it brings in the pilots of Twimby and Wimby, which is light and pastel.
4829651	4835074	Also, you can actually get this game in the Twinbee Deluxe Pack for PlayStation and Saturn.
4835094	4836755	It will be portable for PlayStation Portable.
4838056	4838897	PSP, sorry.
4839557	4842819	The version that I linked here is the PC Engine version.
4843900	4846621	It also came out on the X68000.
4846921	4854446	And it's actually out on Virtual Console now.
4855026	4855987	So you can get it, too.
4857047	4857127	Um...
4858408	4864912	Another thing that was cool about this one is that it actually led to a Twinbee OVA.
4865772	4868354	So that was actually kind of cool.
4869334	4873917	Whenever I think of Twinbee, this is the game I actually think of because it was so much fun.
4874297	4876118	Some of the power-ups you can get are so cool.
4876138	4876998	You've got a shadow.
4877599	4881301	I think the shadow is if you hit... No, red is you get a barrier.
4882381	4883822	Purple is the...
4885583	4885843	and so on.
4913119	4923447	And it's cute.
4924828	4926829	And it's super cute.
4927250	4931633	But don't, don't, don't, don't, you know, think differently because it's cute.
4931793	4932614	It gets hard.
4933655	4940259	You get flying, like, where I died is when all these freaking chickens appear in air and run at you.
4940279	4942181	You know, I think I died in Zelda that way once.
4944053	4945574	Seriously, it's like, oh, flying around.
4945814	4946415	Chickens!
4946895	4947395	Run!
4947616	4947976	Dead.
4948556	4950218	Die.
4950718	4951138	Yeah.
4951358	4953060	And of course, it's got cute little voices, too.
4953320	4955321	And the music in it is just freaking fantastic.
4955381	4957823	So, it's Datana Twinbee.
4958323	4958684	Alright.
4958964	4959324	There it is.
4959344	4960865	Konami, give us a new Twinbee!
4961386	4962046	There it is, folks.
4962066	4963807	Your classic game of the week.
4963927	4966489	Twinbee, Stinger, Rainbow, Belle.
4967070	4971112	More importantly, the game that inspired Datana Twinbee for the PC Engine.
4971132	4971193	Yep.
4972013	4972313	There it is.
4972333	4973074	Your classic game of the week.
4974295	4975796	That's going to be a hard one for folks to find.
4975856	4976737	Last week was easy.
4976777	4977278	You did what?
4977318	4977798	Secret of Mana?
4977838	4979099	Or two weeks ago because we weren't here last week.
4979119	4980400	You did Secret of Mana two weeks ago, right?
4980420	4981241	If you've got money.
4981441	4981661	Yeah.
4982142	4983543	Well, or Virtual Console now.
4983883	4984304	Oh, true.
4984624	4987506	But I was really referring to playing it on the sneeze.
4988067	4988247	All right.
4988267	4988687	Well, there you go.
4990789	4998035	I will say you can get a PC Engine core graphics for not too much money if you know where to look.
4998576	4999056	Which would be where?
4999116	4999697	Are you going to share?
5000661	5004522	Um, was it Pink Elephant, I think, was the company?
5004542	5005002	Pink Godzilla.
5005423	5007263	Pink Godzilla, that was it.
5007283	5008744	Oh, the folks that were at PAX.
5009124	5014846	Um, we got ours at Classic Gaming Expo a while back, so I'll see if I can't find the name of it and put it up on the forum.
5015706	5018467	Um, also, oh my god, you've got an SUV on a building.
5018887	5021188	Anyway, um, my...
5022168	5022728	That's awesome.
5022948	5024849	Okay, I'm being distracted by falling cars.
5025770	5033494	But also, the HuCard for Twinbee actually shouldn't be that expensive if you have someone buy it for you in Japan.
5034934	5036715	I don't really think the HuCard's that expensive at all.
5037456	5038296	I will tell you one thing.
5038336	5042958	If you're trying to play a HuCard on an American system, none of the converters really work.
5043058	5047341	Even if you've got that Leet Purple one, it's freaking expensive and it works half the time.
5047381	5048241	So don't even bother with it.
5048261	5049001	Just get a PC Engine.
5049962	5050222	The end.
5052105	5056266	Alright, well we're going to take a break here and come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5056286	5058387	There's still plenty we have yet to discuss this week.
5058407	5060567	We haven't even gotten to some of the PlayStation news that came out of E3.
5060607	5065908	We're going to talk about a little bit of, what is this, CrossEye, She, XE.
5066508	5070529	We're going to try and make some sense out of this and what it's all about right after a quick break.
5070569	5073510	So we'll be back in just a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5073530	5075591	Unless you're on the podcast, then it's only a few seconds.
5075931	5076731	So we'll be right back.
5083268	5083508	JustinTV.com
5103248	5122161	Where, uh, tonight you're not looking at our ugly mugs doing the show, we thought maybe there'd be something a little more exciting if we, uh, have a video, well, A, I actually lost the camera, but I think this is actually working out, where Loki's actually playing a game during the show, and tonight he's playing Grand Theft Auto 4, but he's playing a special version, uh, that he hacked, the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto, and it has super uber physics in it.
5122361	5136951	Yeah, if you're a fan of the PC version, it has the Super Comet, which I added those physics to the bus and to the ambulance, and then I modified the Mac 11 in there to have a pretty fast...
5140865	5144671	Fire8, and almost a thousand rounds in a clip.
5145131	5153543	And then my punching has a physics force of 60,000, so I can punch cars into space, basically.
5155546	5155847	All right.
5157228	5159869	So you're going to continue to play that throughout this show.
5160069	5162150	But you've got to pause it and do some news.
5162730	5165111	We want to talk about some Sony news here real quick.
5166252	5170933	So there's this alternate reality game that's going on in home right now.
5171774	5172394	Thanks, Sony.
5173354	5179081	The game is called, well, it's XI, or she, or as I'm calling it, Cross-Eyed.
5180122	5183286	I don't know, the symbol itself doesn't look like XI, so I don't know where they're getting that from.
5183667	5186510	It kind of looks like an hourglass or something, but whatever.
5188670	5204882	but anyways they have a trailer that was released I guess and I haven't really gotten a chance to do any of this but apparently they have like a weekly recap and there's some sort of like clues you need to find and they have a ticker and stuff so um
5206084	5207225	So you said it's the Greek symbol?
5207245	5208685	It's the Greek symbol, so it's Ski.
5208966	5209846	Huh!
5210386	5211727	Greek symbol, really?
5211927	5212147	Yes.
5212448	5212668	Hmm.
5212928	5219571	I wonder if this has to do with anything that's probably going to tie in with an announcement for God of War 3, or at least a release date or something like that.
5220372	5221532	I wonder, I wonder, I wonder.
5221552	5222433	Ooh, you're smart.
5224374	5224614	Really?
5224734	5226055	No, it's smart.
5226135	5229257	And it's the summer right now, so July.
5230337	5234279	Anyways, so I don't know what exactly this is going to be unveiling.
5234419	5235220	I'm sure it's going to...
5236778	5241143	Waste enough time to E3 and maybe they'll make some sort of announcement that ties in with everything.
5241963	5244426	But hey, who doesn't like a good ARG?
5244486	5248070	I mean, was it I Heart Bees or I Love Bees or something like that?
5248230	5248370	Yeah.
5250236	5250576	So cool.
5250596	5253097	If you want to check it out, just go in the home.
5253377	5257598	I should sue for copyright because that's how people mispronounce my name all the time is Ski.
5259439	5261539	It's Ksi.
5262000	5262860	Like K-S-I.
5264240	5266661	No, I think Loki hit the nail on the head though.
5266701	5271803	If it's for anything it is probably some type of underground campaign for God of War 3.
5272263	5272983	Yeah, sounds like it.
5273547	5274007	DarkSakura.com
5295632	5298634	All right, well, anyhow, let's talk about some other news at a Game Developers Conference.
5324247	5328628	It's coming out first in Brazil and then I guess some other markets maybe in South America or other places.
5329709	5337231	What's interesting, Quake, Evil Prey, and Action Hero 3D are some of the titles that are supposed to be already on the console by the time you get it.
5338391	5342012	It's not something that's supposed to compete with the Wii, the 360, or the PlayStation 3.
5342972	5348734	Apparently what this console is going to do, it actually connects to a large 3G network through a big cellular provider.
5349674	5352835	And apparently it's not necessarily about being the most powerful system out there.
5353175	5360077	But it's supposed to be about getting stuff through download channels to help combat piracy that goes on.
5360477	5361178	But this is interesting.
5361318	5366319	EA Mobile, Capcom, Namco Networks, PopCap Games, THQ, they're all on board.
5366779	5370941	And it's going to cost about $7 to $13 per game.
5371421	5373041	I converted to American dollars there for you.
5373401	5374642	The console itself, $264 American though.
5374682	5375582	The question though, I mean...
5379103	5381425	I'm not really familiar with mobile games too much.
5381645	5384027	Is there really that much piracy of mobile games?
5384087	5387549	I mean, I would think that they're not losing that much money on that stuff.
5389230	5390071	That's just my thought.
5391732	5400978	YYR in chat has a funny thought about the trophy room, that you'll have to buy the trophy room for 99 cents, and then you'll have to buy the bookshelf, put the trophy on for 49 cents each, because they can each only hold three trophies.
5404481	5407663	I thought he was being serious at first, but no, I don't think that's real.
5409031	5437482	Anyhow, so yeah, there is a new console coming out, just not in the part of the world where most of you are from, but I do know we have some international listeners, so maybe this is something some of our international listeners might get their hands on and see if it's worth it or not, although probably the folks listening to this program are already importing the more expensive stuff, but you know what, $260 whatever dollars American, I think $599 Brazilian for that system is a bargain compared to what you would pay for a lot of the consoles imported down there, so something to think about.
5440810	5448477	There's actually some news on the more conventional system front.
5449138	5454803	There is a Katamari Damacy tribute coming to PlayStation 3.
5456704	5471934	The original version is supposed to be in Katamari Damacy Tribute, where it will be presented in 1080p and have a new visual presentation.
5471994	5472735	That's a quote.
5475036	5483381	It's going to have remixes from the previous titles, as far as the music is concerned, and it's...
5484742	5486983	I'm guessing it's a big Katamari mashup.
5488384	5490485	Yeah, I think it's a bunch of the levels from the other games.
5491065	5492586	Wish there was some new stuff.
5493566	5494827	It's still going to be fun.
5495127	5497248	Oh yeah, I'll have to pick it up.
5498148	5499569	Weird Six Axis stuff.
5500998	5501198	SuckSaxis
5532860	5533620	I just don't understand.
5533640	5536943	I would think they'd make more money at retail if they brought it out.
5538844	5542867	But maybe they just want less packaging or something.
5542887	5543327	I don't know.
5544328	5544588	Whatever.
5545569	5550353	Something else that's coming in the way of the PS3 and we were talking about Home a little bit earlier.
5550373	5560720	They're going to get some new spaces actually including Guitar Hero themed space called Backstage with Guitar Hero and of course they're going to have
5562988	5564749	All the House of Blues kind of stuff.
5565129	5566230	I guess one of the levels from the game.
5566670	5571134	There's also a VIP space in the back, which is sealed off by a velvet rope.
5571634	5573976	I'm not sure who they're going to have back there.
5577479	5583463	Other than that, there's going to be a mini-game or something like that.
5584144	5586126	Rock God, which is kind of like Simon.
5587025	5588785	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5616601	5617241	or anything like that.
5617402	5621705	Wasn't there this whole thing though that you were going to be able to launch PlayStation games from within home?
5621825	5621985	Yeah.
5622025	5623986	Well, I guess you still can kind of do that, but I don't know.
5624026	5629430	You just don't see a lot of people actually doing that compared to, I don't know, Xbox 360 just kind of seems to make it all easy.
5629450	5630191	You know what I mean?
5630371	5633653	It's just like home is like a big non-necessity, I guess.
5633933	5635034	I mean, it's cool.
5635675	5638457	It has a lot of potential, but they're not really using it.
5640258	5640438	Yeah.
5640458	5640538	Yeah.
5641724	5641984	I don't know.
5666178	5668539	Well, PlayStation Home is just going to keep growing, you guys.
5668879	5673280	There's the Red Bull area, there's the Resident Evil 5 area, Warhawk, now Guitar Hero.
5673640	5674020	Guess what?
5674080	5679542	Apparently, according to Jack Buser, who is the director of PlayStation Home, he talked about a game developers conference this week.
5679882	5683443	You will see about, quote, three new spaces launched a month.
5684841	5685841	www.DarkSakura.com
5705328	5708951	and 75% of the users will spend more than 10 minutes on the space.
5709451	5717918	And like I said before, despite the quality, the fact is you go into these spaces and it's like a giant advertisement for the game which you might be more likely to buy.
5717938	5721981	Is that 10 minutes part of the downloading the space or the waiting for the lag?
5722182	5723302	Mine don't take that long.
5723543	5726145	Watching the loops of Twilight over and over?
5726425	5726665	Yeah.
5726685	5728487	Yeah.
5728807	5728967	Yeah.
5730863	5731203	I don't know.
5731663	5733285	They show new movies on there now, don't they?
5733725	5735667	I saw Mall Cop in there for like two weeks.
5738569	5739250	Alright, well anyhow.
5740291	5742473	Well, you know what's better than everything in the universe?
5744074	5744355	Cake.
5744595	5745215	Zombies!
5746056	5746757	Zombies with cake?
5747304	5749185	Ooh, that would be fantastic.
5749326	5750486	Zombie cake party.
5751027	5752588	I love loathing zombies.
5754129	5759513	There is a newcomer to the PlayStation Store that's called Burn Zombie Burn.
5761114	5762415	It's, of course, on PS3.
5762435	5774184	There's also, though, to go along with that is downloadable content for LittleBigPlanet, Pain, Resistance 2, End War, Call of Duty 5, and a PS1 copy of Magic Carpet.
5775405	5776666	Oh my god, I remember that game.
5778702	5781685	Burn Zombie Burn is by Double Six.
5782166	5788171	It's going for £6.29 in Euros at £7.99.
5790954	5795959	You have to hold off zombies for as long as you can.
5796439	5798762	The longer you hold them out, the higher score you get.
5798782	5799843	Where have I heard of this before?
5800123	5800664	Left 4 Dead?
5802709	5806955	The longer you hold off the zombies, the more content you unlock based on your score.
5807716	5816127	For Resistance 2, there's the Aftermath Map Pack and Call of Duty World at War will get Map Pack 1 and...
5819856	5824977	They actually have to pay more than we did on Xbox, but I think it's supposed to be much more touched up.
5826338	5827778	There's the Pain Smack Pack.
5828298	5836341	The El Chili Grande character, I guess for that, LittleBigPlanet, is getting a Buzz costume.
5838281	5843943	End War and Unreal Tournament 3 get the Veteran Map Pack and Titan Pack, respectively.
5844523	5844963	Those are free.
5846943	5849045	That's kind of neat that they have some Resistance stuff.
5849606	5851147	I have to actually play through that still.
5851628	5859615	Well, another thing for the PSP is Buzz Brain of the UK.
5860296	5862198	But that's for UK only, I think.
5863919	5864580	Break One Out Break One Out
5894182	5896463	and it's basically a breakout clone.
5898463	5907166	But what's unique about it though is there's this chick, Kitty, who looks like a cosplayer and there's revealing photos of her.
5907846	5912367	Except, you know, where all the naughty bits are covered with black bars, but she is naked in the pictures.
5912427	5920209	So basically you play the game and you unlock naked pictures of this one chick who I don't know, she's alright.
5920629	5922710	She's not hot, but
5923923	5928544	How's a cosplayer at your average anime convention could be?
5929544	5938046	Let me guess, somebody made this game just for the sake of making the first controversial, titty-filled community game, correct?
5939067	5941447	Probably.
5941947	5947048	But, hey, it's out there, and I think it's cheap.
5947349	5949049	I'm not sure if it's like two bucks or something, but...
5950222	5951103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5976710	5981332	Anyhow, YYR is saying that it was only up for a day or less.
5981372	5982872	Do you think this thing was already taken down?
5982952	5983713	I wouldn't be surprised.
5984353	5984693	It's alright.
5984853	5985353	It was crap.
5985373	5990455	I kind of wish I had downloaded it just to have it, but oh well.
5991696	5991896	Well.
5993126	5998750	Microsoft is in a little bit of hot water this week over something you've probably seen floating around the game blogs this week.
5998810	6003473	And this has to do with Lionhead Studios, who is, of course, a subsidiary of Microsoft.
6003513	6004734	They're the folks behind Fable.
6005835	6008756	And here's the interesting part of this story.
6009317	6012739	It has to do with a gay video game designer, and his name is Jamie Durant.
6013320	6022486	And he's actually going to be suing Microsoft for £45,000 due to hurt feelings, lost pay, discrimination, all due to his sexual orientation.
6023306	6043432	and this apparently happened after Microsoft bought Lionhead he's worked for this company for 11 years apparently and he says things began to get a little bit uneasy around there and starting around January of the last year he started getting abusive emails with subjects reading like me and my favorite men I'm Jim and I'm gay and he was given the nickname Fagboy Jim
6045771	6061777	He's apparently complained to the Human Resources Department, but nothing happened except a promise and a memo that was supposed to go around to the company about diversity in the workplace and all these types of things that companies usually do when they're panicked that a lawsuit might happen, and that the firm was supposed to update the policies.
6061857	6063738	None of this ever happened, according to the lawsuit.
6064538	6071741	And Durant also claims that he was the one who was offered counseling, which he said to that, they're making out that I'm the one with the problem.
6072381	6078050	Apparently he has been out of work suffering from depression for seven months and he's now seeking damages due to this.
6079810	6098078	but I don't know, here's the weird thing and the thing that's kind of weird about this is that Microsoft has kind of gotten praise from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for the way they treat their gay and lesbian and bisexual workers before so is this a problem with one particular office?
6098858	6100559	is this a problem with Lionhead?
6101319	6103560	is this a problem with the employee?
6104420	6106001	there's two sides to every story, right?
6106441	6108002	is there something else going on here?
6109065	6109405	I don't know.
6109966	6110526	It's hard to say.
6110566	6112387	We're only kind of hearing one side of it.
6112607	6118812	They'd have to do a really thorough investigation to get any kind of actual point out of that.
6120522	6124024	The part of it that's interesting is the part that he's already been out of work for seven months.
6124545	6127107	And if it's due to this, it's got to be really bad.
6127527	6128788	It's got to be really, really bad.
6129588	6131850	But, I mean, and again, I don't know this guy.
6132010	6133091	I'm not going to slander this guy.
6133211	6134492	I don't know anything that's going on here.
6134592	6139756	But before, you know, and I think a lot of people might read this and go, oh, Rob's going to be pissed on the show because he's gay too.
6140096	6141057	He's going to throw a fit over this.
6141417	6142218	Not necessarily.
6142938	6144320	Because I also know people...
6145356	6146997	that sometimes like to be the victim.
6147638	6147938	Oh, yeah.
6148138	6148739	You know what I mean?
6149359	6155124	And when I hear this whole fact about he's been out of work for a long time, I start to go, you know, there could be another side to this coin.
6155645	6156065	I don't know.
6156626	6157346	I don't know the facts.
6157547	6158067	I'm not him.
6158487	6161210	But I do know that there could be more to this than meets the eye.
6162580	6163541	I would just hope to hell.
6163801	6166502	Maybe I'm just hopeful, and maybe foolishly so.
6166943	6175568	I'm hopeful to hell that in this fucking year 2009, we would just get past this stupid school playground bullshit.
6176528	6176829	I know.
6177069	6177909	Sadly, we haven't.
6178490	6179170	Not completely.
6179470	6183933	Maybe I'm just spoiled because I happen to work in a place where this shit doesn't happen.
6184133	6188796	And I'm fairly confident, almost 100% confident this kind of shit would not happen.
6190509	6191370	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6215157	6218118	But, you know, there's two sides to every story.
6218519	6222480	Just because the guy filed a lawsuit doesn't necessarily mean it's 100% true.
6222761	6224481	I think that's one thing we have to remember, right?
6225062	6230164	So I don't want to lose my shit and start saying, oh, we should boycott Lionhead and we should boycott all these games.
6230584	6231084	I don't know.
6231825	6241329	Now, if it comes out through due process and in the court of law that, yeah, Lionhead did do something wrong, then I will lose my shit and prepare to say some choice things about the company.
6241830	6243971	But at this stage, it's a little early to tell, correct?
6244551	6244871	I agree.
6246587	6250529	Regardless, very disappointing that this lawsuit is filed one way or the other.
6251509	6256111	So, of course, you knew after a story like this could only come a segment of ours we love.
6274461	6284910	Really, my FU of the week is just people who don't want to look at the facts that want to use their own version.
6286311	6296019	Only a few people will really get the root of this, but it goes towards something that I have noticed that applies to politics, religion, and fandom.
6296039	6296800	Okay.
6297160	6305503	Don't twist things into your version of what they should be just to justify what you believe.
6306263	6307664	At least admit fact.
6307884	6314786	If it's what you believe, then that's what you believe, but at least accept reality.
6315226	6315646	That's all.
6316847	6321848	And also to being super exhausted all day yesterday and being sick from it.
6323429	6323569	Then
6325664	6331027	I personally do not really have any FUs of the week, things have been going fine, so I'll give you an FU to my incessant napping habit.
6331567	6336389	I nap a lot, and it's like screwing up my sleep schedule royally, so I need to stop that.
6336889	6339451	An FU to lack of motivation in my exercise program as well.
6339771	6340651	I need to get back on that.
6341111	6341372	Loki!
6342032	6345694	Um, FU to allergies, because my nose has been all stuffed up the last few days.
6346394	6347534	It's all windy over here.
6348695	6349035	That's it.
6350216	6350576	Alright.
6352315	6353656	That's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
6354316	6355697	Let's get back to some gaming news.
6356097	6358338	DarkSakura, speaking of Lionhead Studios.
6359819	6368043	Well... I am happy because I am still sort of playing this game when I can.
6368923	6373446	But there is actually supposed to be new downloadable content available for Fable 2.
6374266	6376027	And that is exciting.
6376087	6378928	They're still paying attention to us people who are still playing it.
6379709	6379769	Um...
6381423	6386425	It's supposed to be coming out in the spring, so I'm supposing early spring.
6389527	6394329	But there's nothing, I think not a whole lot that I'm seeing about what exactly it is.
6394349	6398491	They're just revealing, they're going to be revealing information on it.
6400352	6405894	But they say that it's supposed to answer questions if you've been a fan of the whole series.
6407015	6410197	And apparently it's supposed to be really dramatic, so I don't know.
6411857	6420844	But there actually, though, has been a statement by Jonathan Ross that he was offered a voice role in Fable 3.
6423365	6424846	So maybe there's a connection there?
6426528	6428309	Maybe there's something leading up into the next game.
6430430	6432031	Great, Fable 3.
6432692	6435614	Will it be exactly the same as Fable 1 and 2?
6436234	6438876	Well, 2 had a lot of differences from 1, I thought.
6438976	6439917	I thought they were very different.
6441571	6442691	Jonathan Ross is pretty cool
6472486	6473666	How cool is that?
6477067	6480928	And possibly soon enough, Doom will be released as well.
6481368	6484869	But, I mean, hey, Wolfenstein 3D, man, that takes me back.
6485089	6493851	One of the first games I actually edited levels for using their... I don't know if they released a level editor or if it was one someone else made, but pretty awesome.
6493951	6496252	And you can actually play it now on the iPhone.
6497112	6501673	And, damn, I can imagine that would probably run pretty well since the game is ancient.
6502932	6527502	but um pretty cool you can speculate what they're saying in German yeah and I guess it's free I'm not sure if this is like a free version of the game or if they're gonna do like a um you know oh it is free I guess it's actually part of an open source project so uh check it out free hey that's best price ever brave for free
6529520	6534583	Well, there's other games coming to the iPhone that aren't free, but they're very, very nostalgic nonetheless.
6535123	6538405	Mega Man 2 is out right now.
6538465	6539206	It's not coming soon.
6539266	6541287	It's already out on the iTunes App Store.
6542348	6549912	It's interesting, though, the way it controls, because since the iPhone doesn't really have any controls on it, which you would think they're going to release something eventually.
6549932	6553414	They can just plug into the bottom of the iPhone and voila, instant gamepad.
6553455	6553735	I don't know.
6554335	6554876	Thanks for watching!
6575267	6575907	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6598676	6603021	TigerClaw on chat wants to point out, Loki, those games you were talking about before are $4.99 in the App Store, not free.
6603302	6604843	Maybe there's a free version or something.
6604903	6605945	Yeah, that's what I was wondering.
6605965	6606726	I was like, free?
6606826	6612793	But it said it was part of an open source project, and it said it was released for free, but I had my doubts, especially with Wolfenstein 3D.
6612813	6615235	They wouldn't give something like that away for free.
6616016	6642107	and of course our chatters are already talking about the Mega Man 2 thing on the iPhone and X-Link says do not buy Mega Man 2, it is hard to control Acidic Vampire says IGN gave the iPhone Mega Man 2 a 1 out of 10 and it's really awful to control not that I would believe everything that IGN says but in this case I would probably believe it the game probably does stink I can totally see how it would be hard to control especially given the way that it's set up I mean, is there a lefty mode in it?
6642627	6643688	I saw the joystick thing
6644768	6645088	I don't know.
6645448	6646289	It's a good question.
6648429	6649229	No, it wouldn't work.
6651590	6658752	Yeah, I don't think that game's going to be any fun to play on the iPhone at all, but hey, if you're that nostalgic and you need it in your pocket everywhere you go, go for it.
6660072	6663253	Or just get like a Game Boy or something, I don't know.
6663653	6665734	Emulate the bitch on PSP.
6666134	6669875	Actually, I'll tell you what Dan and I did whenever we won our Mega Man 2 fix.
6670215	6672616	We actually ordered a handheld Nintendo.
6674082	6674763	DarkSakura.com
6698699	6710146	Um, there's actually going to be a song pack that has Celebrity, Fat Bottom Girls, and We Are The Champions for, um, 440 points, um, for, uh, the pack.
6710807	6712148	Or you can buy each one for 160.
6712388	6717631	Uh, and they're gonna be 549 on, um, PlayStation Network.
6718752	6722574	Um, you actually will be able to get them on Wii as well for 200 Wii points.
6724115	6752761	and then there's supposed to be a new recording of the James Bond theme that's supposed to be available coming up soon I saw something on YouTube I don't know if it was that exact one I thought it was one that someone made how you can make your custom tracks or whatever and it was pretty awesome so hopefully it's the same one because that was a pretty awesome version of the Bond theme lots of liberties taken it looked pretty hard
6755901	6760464	Not quite as kick-ass on the rock band.
6761165	6765968	We get some interesting things, including Spongebob Squarepants music.
6766428	6771131	Who would have thought we'd see that in a rock band, but apparently we are.
6772152	6776935	The Spongebob Squarepants pack is actually going to be relatively cheap.
6776955	6777535	It's going to be...
6779036	6780758	99 cents per song or 80 Microsoft points.
6781838	6787462	And those include I Can't Keep My Eyes Off You, Best Day Ever, and Where's Gary?
6788383	6794347	And then other than that, Journey is going to be getting a song on there with Don't Stop Believin'.
6795508	6800211	And I guess also joining that would be Pat Benatar's Heartbreaker.
6800972	6802653	And that's coming as well.
6804074	6806315	And then some other stuff, Glass Vegas with...
6807932	6813193	Geraldine, and Come On Come On by the Von Blondies.
6814574	6818055	And that's pretty much it for this week, though.
6818435	6819595	Spongebob, that's weird.
6819875	6820776	Yeah, but Journey.
6820936	6822996	Freaking Journey's coming out, so who cares?
6823296	6823916	Exactly.
6824377	6825897	They could have put a better song in there, though.
6826197	6826517	You know what?
6826557	6827157	I actually agree.
6827197	6829058	I think Don't Stop Believin' is way too cliche.
6829138	6830598	And especially for a rock band, there's...
6833399	6834879	Yeah, Wheel in the Sky would be awesome.
6835440	6836320	But, you know, whatever.
6836360	6837140	I'll take what I can get.
6837340	6840781	I mean, who isn't going to want to bust out with Don't Stop Believin' at a Party, right?
6840801	6842882	I just see that one as being way too easy, even on Expert.
6843402	6844302	Yeah, probably.
6844662	6844982	Who knows?
6845443	6853365	Anyhow, this is the part of the show where we like to open up the old mailbag and read some of your emails that you send to us every week at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6853385	6854045	So let's get into it.
6860168	6862090	First email comes from J-Rod.
6862690	6863511	Hey, OLR Crew.
6863651	6867775	I'm emailing to try to get your stance on this Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band war people are in.
6868196	6872239	I still don't see any differences between Rock Band's download content and a Guitar Hero disc.
6873160	6875743	It's both companies putting out new content to the player.
6876684	6883090	I don't even own Guitar Hero, but I at least think it's a good idea to let people without an internet connection actually be able to play new songs.
6883550	6884691	Look at Rock Band on the Wii.
6885592	6890116	Would you seriously be happy owning that when you see what's on the other platforms?
6890636	6895340	Then people complain, well, I only want three of the songs, I don't want to pay $50 for the whole game.
6895900	6907829	But then don't complain at all when they have to buy a new Wii Track Pack for a few songs just because it's the Rock Band title.
6908650	6916597	People say Activision is running the series into the ground by putting out more content, but isn't Rock Band doing the same thing, just not with a physical disc?
6917177	6925284	I don't see how a disc makes any amount of difference in the equation when it's still more songs and more content coming out by both companies.
6925785	6931730	Again, nobody made such a fuss with the ACDC pack or with the We Track packs the way they do with Activision.
6933474	6937236	The only one I would say is the ACDC pack because that wasn't available online.
6937276	6943760	But all the Rock Band track packs are just for people that don't have internet connections and some random stuff that's available for download content.
6944120	6945480	You do not need to buy it.
6945520	6949122	It's not its own... I mean, it can be its own game, which is fine.
6949743	6951504	But it's not basically...
6952677	6952917	and so on.
6971809	6972890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6992589	7016505	Guitar Hero Metallica, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits All stuff that's not necessarily available on their servers And granted, Greatest Hits are some of the older songs that were in the older games But, I mean, they could easily release that as download content for World Tour They don't need to have its own game And really, it's not adding anything, it's just a reskinned World Tour Just...
7017165	7020047	I do know of people who actually do not use live at all.
7033780	7037543	Who don't, you know, bother with it, who don't play online.
7038303	7041005	So for them, Guitar Hero actually is a better option, really.
7042427	7046610	But to finish up the email, because you actually did go on with a little bit more.
7047510	7050913	In the end, if you ask me, it all comes down to people crying about switching discs.
7051453	7052194	Are you kidding me?
7052274	7057818	I own both Rock Band games and don't have Rock Band 2 imported because it takes me six seconds to switch a disc.
7058318	7063022	I play a few songs I want on one game, then play a few songs I want on another game and some download content.
7063562	7071250	If you have friends over and the whole place just shuts down because you have to switch a disc, tell them to take their ADHD medication before they come over next time.
7071570	7074874	And that's the thing with Rock Band, you can import that stuff so you don't have to switch discs.
7074974	7076996	It's all, you know, you can dump it to your hard drive.
7077016	7078297	He completely missed the point of what he just said.
7079418	7081140	Well, the whole, I don't know.
7081180	7084183	The whole point of what he just said is that it takes six seconds to change a disc.
7084574	7086095	Yeah, and here's the thing.
7086155	7086895	It's all optional.
7087016	7090558	No one's forcing you to buy Guitar Hero or Rock Band.
7090658	7092259	So if you want it, you'll want it.
7092319	7092539	Cool.
7092579	7094200	If you don't want it, then don't buy it.
7094540	7110070	But don't feel that you're forced to actually buy this stuff because as soon as you start buying every single release that comes out just because you want to support them so they release whatever band you're waiting for or whatever, I think that's a horrible reason to do it.
7110891	7112613	Rock Band Plays Better Than Guitar Hero
7128809	7131831	In fact, I think Rock Band plays a hell of a lot better than Guitar Hero.
7132271	7136474	It just seems in general programmed to be more responsive, so I have a better time playing that.
7137115	7153426	And in defense of importing your Rock Band 1 tracks, it actually, if you want to mix and match bands from both modes, especially when you can create your own setlist, it actually gives you more freedom to combine it the way that you want to.
7154586	7156628	But hey, whatever sinks your battleship.
7157455	7170078	Well, the thing also with the importing on the Beatles version, I think that was a special deal that they had with, I don't know who owns it, I think it's Apple or something, Apple Music, that they didn't want it to be imported into Rock Band.
7170098	7171938	And it's not technically a Rock Band game.
7172359	7174779	It's just kind of like Rock Band presents the Beatles.
7174859	7176159	It's their own game.
7176259	7179020	It's their own kind of thing going on there.
7179740	7181501	So that's going to be kind of like an exception.
7181561	7186782	But if ever comes out that there's a Rock Band Metallica or something like that,
7188046	7190254	I'm pretty sure that we'll have, you know...
7191781	7219490	import functionality and that kind of stuff and then honestly I don't see them actually doing that I would see them releasing it as like an album you can download because I think that they would get a lot more hits because a lot of people are like I don't like this song I'm not going to buy Guitar Hero Greatest Hits because it only has a couple songs that I want on it well if you could download those songs individually at least you sold those two songs whereas someone might just avoid the package altogether if they can't separate them it's all about choice as Microsoft would say
7222574	7233329	Well, the next email is actually a short one, and I think this is addressed to Rob, really, because I don't think either of us were really boycotting, and he pretty much already answered it, but I'm going to read it anyway.
7233430	7233750	That's fine.
7234431	7239118	Now that the boycott is over, what are you most anxious to try out if you haven't already discussed it?
7240121	7242222	Bit.Trip Beat was one I was really looking forward to.
7242622	7248064	I also want to go back and check out probably one of the Commodore 64 downloads just because I want to see how well those came over.
7248424	7250225	I'm still kind of holding out for Impossible Mission.
7250245	7259049	I would like to be the one I would get, but I'm not opposed to going back and getting one of the other Commodore 64 greats like Last Ninja or Pit Stop 2 even just because I have memories with that one.
7260089	7262970	As far as the WiiWare games, I feel so far behind on a lot of those.
7263010	7264471	I don't even really know where to begin.
7265331	7266892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7287199	7291882	I used to buy every single Xbox Live Arcade game that came out and I really had to stop doing that because some of them were crap.
7303570	7306632	Yeah, I gotta watch out with going too crazy on the Wii.
7306652	7308093	But I'll buy good stuff as it comes out.
7308874	7309814	As I notice it.
7310114	7315298	There was another music game that had come out that I want to go back and check out that I missed.
7315858	7317179	And I don't remember the name of it.
7317199	7318500	Maybe somebody in chat will speak up.
7318540	7324024	But I distinctly remember there was some other type of beat game that had come out previously on WiiWare that I wanted to check out.
7325600	7326220	Last email.
7326900	7328180	This is from Spazinator.
7329521	7330621	Hi everyone at OLR.
7330641	7332681	I have a few questions for you three to mull over.
7333241	7338022	I'll try to keep this email as short as possible, seeing as most of the ones I've sent were a bit on the long side.
7339182	7345243	One, regarding PSN's high-velocity bowling, PS3's version of Wii Bowling, have you folks noticed any problems with the game?
7345663	7354305	Gameplay in and of itself seems fine to me, but I can see how a lot of people may have a problem with the game, specifically the characters within the game.
7354745	7369493	so the characters are basically stereotypes ranging from Latinos to 70s Black Panther-esque characters and even a gay flight attendant if it weren't for the stereotypes this would be a great game but as I'm actually embarrassed to say that I
7370453	7387604	but as is I'm actually embarrassed to say that I have this hell I don't even remotely resemble any of the stereotypes yet I find myself offended for the people that the stereotyping characters are supposed to poke fun of what is your position on this am I just overreacting or is there some cause for concern um
7390316	7391577	Don't be offended for other people, please.
7411587	7412888	Don't be offended for other people.
7413068	7414950	If they're gonna be offended, let them be offended.
7415190	7416071	You don't worry about it.
7416271	7418993	If you're not doing the offense, then don't freaking worry about it.
7419073	7419974	That's what I have to say.
7422626	7423947	You didn't make the game.
7424728	7426970	You bought it and you didn't know that it was in there.
7427530	7431233	You know, just roll with the punches.
7431273	7432154	Fucking deal with it.
7432814	7433395	It's there.
7433555	7438739	It's, you know, I personally, I crack up as hell at redneck stereotypes.
7438819	7439320	Seriously.
7439880	7442342	And I can say that's all my family, you know.
7442522	7445224	I know that not everyone from Alabama is stupid and inbred.
7445765	7447947	But I still laugh at Larry the Cable Guy.
7449036	7449957	because that's a parody.
7451037	7453279	You know, I don't see what the big deal is.
7453419	7455741	His name isn't Larry and he's not really a cable guy.
7455781	7457022	Exactly, it's parody.
7457782	7460464	It's perpetuating a stereotype for satire.
7462045	7462906	I haven't played the game.
7463346	7475936	I don't really want to make a comment on something I haven't really seen firsthand, but it doesn't sound like it's... As long as it's... There's a line, there's a real fine line, a real fine line between poking fun and maliciously
7477099	7478260	You know, hurting people.
7478420	7481302	And I doubt this game's trying to maliciously hurt people, if that makes sense.
7483164	7483664	But I don't know.
7483805	7484285	I'd have to see it.
7484305	7484965	It's a bowling title!
7485606	7498256	How could it be malicious unless it's just over the top with, you know... If the characters just look that way and may have a little bit of dialogue, that's just... That's just supposed to be fun.
7499037	7503941	You know, people need to really, I think, just toughen up and get the hell over it.
7504021	7504381	And you...
7506023	7514912	This is my opinion, again, I'm not telling you what to believe, but I don't think that one person has the right to be offended on behalf of another person.
7515192	7517995	Especially if there's a chance that they're not offended.
7519597	7520238	That's just me.
7522761	7526725	I doubt I would be offended by the little gay flight attendant or whatever in this game.
7527162	7530583	This is like every single game has those kind of stereotype characters.
7530643	7536344	Because people can identify with stereotype characters, you know, they're in movies.
7536464	7540365	I mean, how many stereotype movies are out there?
7540385	7543485	I mean, just like, all sorts of stuff.
7543865	7547346	It's just, it's part of everyday life in the media, unfortunately.
7547386	7556248	Even in Austin Powers, we had Foxy Cleopatra, and that was just a nod back to the 70s movies, you know, like the, what was her name, Pam Greer, you know.
7558102	7561546	Bobby in chat says, I'm offended on DarkSakura's behalf about offended people.
7563607	7565149	They can bite my ass!
7566450	7567411	Chew on that for a bit.
7568012	7568552	Seriously.
7569673	7571234	GS68 makes an interesting comment.
7571255	7574738	I don't know how far we want to go with this, but I'm going to open a whole can of worms.
7574758	7575078	Here we go.
7575559	7582385	GS68 says, by that same token, everyone who isn't not straight shouldn't have voted no on Prop 8.
7585132	7586494	I don't know, he used bad grammar here.
7586534	7586915	Should've?
7587556	7589819	That's not a matter of being offended.
7590219	7593323	That's a matter of a human rights issue.
7593924	7595326	That's apples and oranges right there.
7596502	7598683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7621169	7622230	It was a very big thing.
7622270	7623610	It's a big human rights issue.
7624070	7635634	There's a difference, though, between... I know people who may not particularly agree with the lifestyle who voted no on Prop 8.
7637014	7638935	Just because it was a matter of human rights.
7640274	7647839	I don't know how far I want to go with this, but I can just say, you know, it's like, you know, obviously the issue is very important to me and the result was very, very, very, very, very disappointing.
7647859	7651821	And I even had some people tell me that, you know, they voted yes on it.
7651861	7653302	Like, I don't know, they felt the need to confess.
7654323	7658185	They voted yes on it because church or God told them to.
7658265	7661107	And it's so frustrating because it's like, think for yourself.
7661847	7662948	How would you like it if it was you?
7664602	7665002	DarkSakura.com
7688037	7693379	Currently, I have a relatively cheap Sony Bravia surround system, which I got from Target last year.
7693759	7698160	For the most part, it serves its purpose and sounds good, but there is one problem I've noticed.
7698240	7704682	Unless I'm playing a DVD and it's a built-in DVD player, I won't get surround sound as is.
7705162	7708303	In terms of input, the system has typical red-white RCA jacks.
7709303	7711404	Mini plug input like what you'd see on headphones.
7711984	7714065	Some kind of jack I'm unfamiliar with.
7714565	7718707	All I know is that it's the one iPods use for outputs, I guess.
7719847	7731792	In essence, is there a way to trick my surround system to accept stuff like my PS3 or 360 surround which supports sound output and actually hear it in my surround sound or basically in my SOL?
7732372	7734273	Any info on this will help a lot, thanks.
7735053	7743063	My recommendation is to go on eBay and look for a hardened Carmen receiver and just use your speakers and use that.
7744358	7755202	Sounds like your receiver doesn't actually have surround sound, maybe ProLogic, which would be why you don't have any actual digital or analog surround sound inputs.
7755923	7764126	Usually you would have an optical in, which you might see on the back of your PS3 or your Xbox 360 on the component cable and stuff like that.
7765286	7771489	Or sometimes a coax as well, which would be kind of like your RCA plugs, but they're orange.
7773010	7775991	So, um... I don't know.
7776011	7781571	If you don't have either one of those, you're probably not going to really get true surround sound unless they have some sort of surround sound mode in it.
7782272	7787192	It's going to have to be ProLogic, which you're just going to hook up through your standard RCA, red and white.
7787392	7793213	My initial thought with this was anytime you use a converter, you're going to lose some sound quality, right?
7793293	7795474	So, isn't that part of the problem, too?
7796174	7801735	No, it's just that he doesn't have an actual way to send the 5.1 signal over to his system.
7802668	7803669	Thanks for watching!
7825511	7827132	Tip from Tigerclaw here in chat.
7827172	7831014	The surround receiver must have optical inputs to plug the PS3 or 360 into it.
7831394	7836176	My receiver has one optical input and I have the 360 connect to it and it's outputting 5.1 surround in the games.
7838077	7840498	Actdeft is calling this call for help OLR edition.
7842339	7842539	Nice.
7846125	7852611	I still say, you can find a good used Harmon card and receiver for not that expensive.
7854112	7856314	The new ones, $700 each.
7856894	7861278	Old ones, anywhere between $150 to $300, and you will never regret it.
7861878	7862539	They're fantastic.
7863598	7865139	have you tried rebooting your router
7882384	7883505	I've heard all this before.
7885466	7888768	I love whenever I call Comcast to say the cable's out and that's the first thing they tell me to do.
7888788	7890069	I'll be like, okay.
7891050	7891670	Okay, I did it.
7891710	7892191	Still nothing.
7892211	7893491	And I didn't just do a damn thing.
7893512	7896594	I'm just sitting there going, oh, this still doesn't work.
7896634	7905840	What I do is I say, okay, please allow me to say before we begin this discussion, yes, I have reset my modem.
7905900	7907001	I've reset my router.
7907401	7910283	I have done a repair on the system and I've gone through all my network settings.
7910723	7912104	It is not on my end.
7912604	7912804	Tyto!
7912845	7913025	What?
7934511	7939874	They are still doing more first-person shooters in the arcades.
7939954	7954863	They did the Half-Life 2 Survivor, and now they've got one called Cyber Driver, which is a take on another first-person shooter game, but it's supposed to have five-on-five networked play and a different game system.
7955383	7957845	So you can see your battle damage in game.
7958225	7963968	So it's supposed to be pretty... The screen capture looks pretty cool, but I'm like, meh.
7964488	7967270	Because first person shooter is high, boring.
7968911	7969771	Unless they're Call of Duty.
7973093	7973714	But it could be cool.
7974074	7974334	I don't know.
7980667	7993483	Well, something else that's interesting, this kind of goes back to all this stuff we've been talking about, alternate services and stuff that are going to be not necessarily competing with consoles, but
7994355	7995776	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8020819	8024921	Not necessarily Earthbound, might be part of Earthbound, but looks like Earthbound.
8026623	8028904	How exactly does the game look like Earthbound?
8028964	8038650	Is it just like the sprite-based modern... The sprite-based, you know, like set in kind of a city type thing looks very Earthbound-esque, like the sprites look very similar.
8039130	8041852	And they're wondering, could it be an Earthbound game?
8041872	8043793	Like maybe an Earthbound 4 or something like that.
8046034	8046554	Who knows?
8046935	8047215	Hmm.
8049088	8050069	It's cute!
8050109	8051190	And I really dig the font
8078052	8078754	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8087578	8091081	I looked at the screenshots, it did look a little bit cute.
8091521	8097066	Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8097607	8101190	And it has to do with other RPG series full of fanboy wank.
8101230	8106174	We've talked about Earthbound a couple times tonight, but we have yet to address the wank that is Final Fantasy VII.
8106794	8112819	And of course, how many Final Fantasy VII fanboys did not get the chance to fap to Advent Children?
8112859	8114341	Well, Advent Children complete...
8115041	8119402	is apparently the final end of the Advent Children saga.
8119462	8125104	Meaning that there is no more special editions or director's cuts or hidden scenes or any of that.
8125544	8127744	Advent Children Complete is the end of the line.
8128005	8132046	Which, by the way, did I not also read somewhere this week that they did confirm this for the US in June?
8132746	8133186	I want to say.
8133266	8136567	Yeah, but not the cool version with the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
8136607	8136927	Don't.
8137897	8143860	But if you're willing to settle for the one without it or don't want to deal with the import or what have you, you can at least get it there in June.
8143880	8147362	Yes, I'm not willing to settle for that, so import that bitch.
8148062	8149123	However, here's the thing.
8149783	8153285	Final Fantasy VII, however, as a whole, not done.
8154046	8159749	Nomura has actually come out and said there is still ideas for the next product in the compilation.
8160629	8164190	Of course, why don't you just do the Final Fantasy 7 remake and then everybody will wank everywhere.
8164210	8166210	That could be the next one coming.
8167270	8167730	Do you think?
8167910	8168711	Do you think for real?
8169211	8175912	I think that Final Fantasy 7 remake is just something that will only live on in that singular tech demo and in fanboy wank fantasies.
8176832	8184874	I think Final Fantasy 7 will be released on PlayStation Network around the time Final Fantasy 13 shows up, especially with the other Final Fantasies being confirmed for Virtual Console.
8185174	8186414	I think that's just a matter of time.
8187591	8192260	and there'll be plenty of wank and new wank as more people discover the series for the first time.
8194387	8198210	But I don't think that Final Fantasy 7 remake is going to happen.
8198230	8199070	But I'll tell you what.
8199651	8207097	All they would have to do is add tiny little things to Final Fantasy 7 when they re-release it on PlayStation Network.
8208298	8208698	Millions.
8209039	8210800	Millions sold to PlayStation Network.
8210920	8212241	Millions.
8212541	8217826	Just say you're going to up the graphics slightly and just put fucking smoothing on it or something and it'll sell zillions.
8218251	8219832	I want a new remake.
8220072	8222573	I actually do want a new remake.
8222753	8223694	Wink, wink, wink, wink, wink.
8224174	8224694	Seriously.
8224874	8228556	Well, keep in mind, Final Fantasy VII is actually one of my favorite RPGs ever.
8229197	8231698	It was one of the first ones I played on the PlayStation.
8231718	8234439	I bought the game before I had a PlayStation.
8235100	8236060	If that's any indication.
8237081	8238381	So I could play it at my friend's house.
8239402	8244384	I want Final Fantasy VI to get the love and adoration first before Final Fantasy VII gets it.
8244885	8247266	But Final Fantasy VII was really...
8248966	8256795	I want to say a milestone in the title and the fact that it brought it into the new realm of 3D, seriously.
8257476	8265124	And I enjoyed the story, I loved the characters except for Aerith who I was glad was dead, dead, dead, dead, dead after the first disc.
8266764	8270669	Then they announced Final Fantasy VII Earth's Return!
8270929	8272491	You know what I actually would not mind seeing?
8272511	8273192	So you can kill her again.
8273592	8278658	Is them putting in the quest that they took out for the US version where you go back and talk to her ghost.
8281021	8281261	Hmm.
8282122	8284625	That I would like to see actually a fully complete version.
8284665	8285426	I think that would be cool.
8286176	8289119	Bobby's in chat saying, I bought my PlayStation 1 for Final Fantasy 7.
8289199	8289579	Me too.
8290340	8291401	You may not know this, but me too.
8291801	8295344	I couldn't afford the system, but I damn well knew enough people who had one, and I bought the game.
8295904	8299287	Made myself broke because I was working at an arcade, but still.
8301329	8302510	It was super cool.
8302530	8307454	I was like, oh my god, it's 3D, and now I'm like, oh my god, it's blocky.
8310188	8310568	I'm offended.
8338070	8341632	On your behalf, I am offended for you Why?
8342972	8362761	I don't know, I was just going to say that Hey, what's up, it's Bobby Not much, hey Bobby, I'm glad you called Because you have us on your show every week And yet we don't get to hear from you all the time Usually because you go to bed, probably by this time But we got to the sky blind before midnight eastern tonight So I'm glad to hear from you What's up Bobby, what do you think of the show tonight?
8364291	8365372	I like the show from what I heard.
8365412	8368374	I had to go do other things, unfortunately, so I'll have to listen to the archive.
8368394	8375940	But no, I actually had a specific reason to call in and specifically talk about this on your show, because I heard about this on your show several weeks ago.
8376220	8376480	Okay.
8377261	8379443	And it's regarding iPhone games.
8380820	8387583	To preface this a little bit, Apple really takes their user interface and their user experience very seriously.
8387643	8397448	When you get into the iPhone developer program, there is this document you have to read through that says, this is the user experience we expect for every user of our device.
8398209	8411283	And there's one game that completely breaks this user experience, and I am very shocked that it's available on the App Store, and it's one game that your roommate, Rob, recommended on this very program.
8411483	8412324	Oh, really?
8412384	8416088	And that would be the role-playing game he was mentioning a couple weeks ago?
8417080	8446512	Arvale, A-R-V-A-L-E Arvale, it has a lite version and so I played the lite version before I bought the full version and he probably hasn't seen this because he said he bought the full version so he probably never saw the egregious insult to humanity that Arvale does strictly against Apple's user agreement so basically when you're playing a game on your iPhone or an iPod Touch what do you expect to happen when you hit the home button the big square button
8446917	8448578	You're going to go back to the main menu.
8449359	8449899	Exactly.
8449940	8451140	That's what you would think, right?
8451701	8452141	Right.
8452782	8456165	That's exactly what Apple wants all of their developers to do.
8456325	8458827	It has to do it within a certain time frame.
8459087	8462350	You have literally three to five seconds maximum.
8463069	8466452	to delete all your stuff, save everything, and go back to the home menu.
8466833	8472398	Well, Arvale decided that is the perfect time for them to try to tell you to get more money.
8473299	8478183	In the Lite version of Arvale, when you hit the home button, it loads up Safari.
8478703	8487432	So it goes to the menu, and then it loads up Safari, which then closes and opens up the App Store to a non-active URL.
8487992	8489773	so it goes to the homepage of the App Store.
8489813	8497997	I think they wanted to actually have it pop up the full version of Arvale so you could buy it, but this happens every single time you close the app.
8498217	8498957	Interesting.
8499738	8505880	I'm on an iPod Touch, so I don't know if it does that if you get a call, because I don't have the phone portions or anything.
8506201	8507221	Oh God, that would annoy me.
8508242	8511143	But yeah, so when you close the app, it
8511536	8524487	takes you to Safari first which then closes immediately and takes you to the App Store and it winds up that the URL it gives the App Store is not a valid URL so it just goes to the featured front page of the App Store.
8525493	8526333	Interesting.
8526653	8537657	No, I mean, you know, since John isn't as into the games as the rest of us are, he probably didn't even ever really notice this, or maybe just kind of put up with it because he enjoyed the game or what have you.
8538017	8539037	But that's fascinating.
8539097	8549760	Why do you think Apple, you know, aren't these things supposed to be, I don't know, but then again, the Apple Store is swamped with these types of games, so whatever review process they have can't be that thorough.
8550200	8552601	So I suppose that's why this type of thing didn't get caught.
8552641	8557002	But is it interesting that the game is still on the store after all this?
8557982	8561043	It's not that they're not thorough, because they would have seen this.
8561123	8565164	Because it does take several weeks to get approved to go on the App Store once you submit it.
8565804	8569865	I'm not exactly sure how much I can divulge of it, because there is an NDA involved and stuff.
8570285	8575726	But it does take a couple weeks, and they do go through and make sure that you're following their user interface guidelines.
8575766	8586409	There's several things you cannot do in a game, one of which I believe I can go ahead and say is you can't have any buttons on the UI that you can't use.
8587049	8589649	So you can't say this button is disabled in the free version.
8589689	8590310	You can't do that.
8590350	8592390	They will reject your game, and they do find that.
8592630	8593230	Wow, weird.
8593270	8596071	So they do go through and make sure that every...
8599740	8602021	in the game, in the Lite version of the game is usable.
8602081	8605243	You cannot have any feature that's there but not usable.
8606143	8613327	So they go through at least that much because I know a lot of people have complained about getting their stuff sent back because they don't follow these user interface guidelines.
8613347	8619210	So I have no clue how RDA Lite got away with when you close the game, it opens up to other applications.
8619250	8619930	I don't know how they got it.
8619970	8622252	But that being said, I did not play it again.
8622292	8623472	I deleted it right then.
8623812	8625373	I didn't bother trying any further.
8625393	8626414	So I don't know if it's any good or not.
8627305	8628025	Interesting.
8628265	8628486	Huh.
8628966	8631367	That is a pretty shady thing to do though with that.
8632007	8632747	That's unfortunate.
8633228	8636329	But yeah, I know he had the light version because he was playing it for a little while.
8638410	8642631	But maybe some of us kind of expect that that's what the free games are going to do when it's over if we haven't played.
8642891	8646413	So it's interesting to have that insider's perspective that they're technically violating the agreement.
8647573	8647834	Weird.
8648534	8650194	I wonder if anything's going to happen.
8650935	8652255	Yeah, I mean, I hope so.
8652275	8653636	I should probably report them and stuff.
8653656	8655977	But the iTunes reviews don't even mention it.
8655997	8656197	There's a
8658368	8660229	and then it opened up three other apps.
8662349	8663350	But this game is awesome.
8664450	8665330	JRPG and stuff.
8665950	8667331	I don't know.
8668371	8669732	Bobby, you're cutting in and out there a little bit.
8669752	8670892	I don't know what that was all about.
8672713	8674513	Maybe it's just... I don't know.
8674573	8676334	Maybe... I have no idea.
8676634	8679875	It's so weird that people would not call that out in the reviews either.
8680795	8683236	Now I kind of want to download it to see if it happens with me too.
8685515	8691116	Well, they have updated it, so there's no updates to mine still.
8693217	8695237	Bobby's cutting in and out really bad.
8695337	8696597	Bobby, can you still hear us?
8699558	8700438	Are you guys able to hear me?
8700598	8701198	Yes, we can.
8701218	8702038	You're just cutting in and out.
8702078	8703618	We have a lot of lag issues going on.
8703658	8704739	I don't know what's up with that.
8704759	8704999	Weird.
8706019	8711700	But yeah, maybe, I don't know, could it be that the new patch they put out maybe cut this off?
8713444	8715505	Thanks for watching!
8736977	8741059	So, you know, not a lot of people, I guess we could say, have done this and he wants to kind of show this off.
8741119	8746301	And maybe if we have another special game that we want to show, like a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom kind of thing.
8746341	8748822	We're doing fucking Excitebots when that comes out.
8749302	8751943	I'm telling you, Excitebots, hell yeah.
8752143	8754364	I don't think you can expect this from us every week.
8754804	8755004	No.
8755324	8756265	I just like tossing cards at people.
8756285	8761026	We don't have a switcher to switch back and forth from the game to the camera and all that stuff, so it's one or the other.
8761086	8766929	We don't have the fancy little three-camera setup that you have at the gaming arena.
8767069	8770890	As soon as we don't have the camera right now, this is what you're going to have to get.
8771210	8775212	And it's not a video show, and I don't think any of us want it to be a video show right now.
8775252	8776652	I think we're all interested maybe in doing it.
8776672	8780674	Well, some of us are interested in doing video content for the site, but not a video show.
8780854	8781674	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
8783844	8785525	All right, well, Friday Night Gaming is 8 p.m.
8785585	8786326	Eastern and 5 p.m.
8786346	8787146	Pacific on Fridays.
8787426	8789227	Awesome way to work in that plug, Bobby.
8789528	8793230	There it is in a now-featured Ustream channel, so you can watch it on the Ustream app on your phone.
8795931	8796692	All right, take care, Bobby.
8798773	8799413	Bye-bye.
8800254	8801455	He's cutting out there, even at the end.
8801495	8801995	What's up with that?
8802035	8803075	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8803095	8803436	Who's this?
8804536	8805377	It's Deathwishing.
8805537	8806598	Hello, Deathwishing.
8806618	8807058	What's on your mind?
8808554	8812637	Uh, I've been really pissed off since not last Thursday, but the Thursday before that.
8813297	8813778	Why is that?
8814578	8820302	Uh, well, if you didn't know, when the Call of Duty MatPat 1 came out, there were billing problems.
8820562	8821763	Did you guys hear about that at all?
8822103	8826946	No, but again, admittedly, I don't think any of us are rabid Call of Duty players, so fill us in on what's up.
8828107	8832550	Put it this way, I bought Microsoft Points during this time with a points card.
8834429	8836652	and I come home, right?
8836692	8839435	Just walking home because gas.
8840376	8841597	And I'm really excited.
8841657	8842518	Entering the code in.
8842698	8843739	I get my points, right?
8843759	8845101	And I'm like, cool, I'm going to get the maps.
8845121	8846382	It says points are added to my account.
8846422	8847023	Click the button.
8847063	8847464	Buy the map.
8847484	8849205	It says I have insignificant funds.
8850207	8850927	I'm freaking out.
8851067	8851448	Wait a minute.
8851468	8852189	Are you on Twitter?
8853444	8854284	No, I'm not on Twitter.
8854705	8858926	Okay, somebody on Twitter, on my Twitter, and I'm sorry, I think was having this exact same problem.
8858946	8867029	So yes, I do remember hearing about this, because didn't something break down with the billing service or something that night, and a bunch of people tried to redeem their points, they didn't get them?
8867290	8871311	Okay, somebody on Twitter was complaining about this exact same thing you're complaining about now, that's why I asked this.
8871991	8873512	So, okay, yes, I did hear this.
8874032	8880595	And I've been talking to Microsoft since then, and they firstly told me 5-10 days, and then after that they told me
8881853	8885515	I was going to get a call, and I got the call saying I had to wait two to three more days after that.
8886255	8890356	And then this Saturday was supposed to be the third day, which they said I was supposed to get the points.
8890396	8891177	Still no points.
8891777	8894698	I tried calling, and now they're not taking my call.
8896859	8898660	Wow, it's like a bad breakup or something.
8898700	8900080	Now they're just ditching your call.
8900701	8902401	And that's like $20, man.
8902481	8903782	I could have done a lot with that.
8905339	8908502	Yeah, so you never did get the points.
8908622	8909923	You never got the points.
8909963	8910523	Still waiting.
8910684	8911144	Wow.
8911604	8913706	You're lucky I'm a patient guy, too.
8913946	8917189	I'm wondering if it's more than, I mean, it's got to be more than just you.
8917229	8919811	I should figure out who it was on Twitter and follow up with them, too.
8920271	8923334	There's a bunch of people on the Xbox forums that were complaining, too.
8923414	8923995	Well, I'm sure.
8924075	8926697	Some people received compensation, some people still haven't.
8927097	8934161	Huh, so this doesn't have to do necessarily with Call of Duty specifically, it's just that it broke Microsoft's server somehow.
8934181	8939543	Well, and what it does have to do with Call of Duty is to do with all the people wanting to play Call of Duty.
8939824	8940064	I see.
8941324	8941604	I see.
8942005	8942205	Huh.
8942915	8945557	Well, were you ever able to get the map pack?
8945577	8946458	Did you invest the points later?
8946478	8948340	No, I still haven't gotten it yet.
8948620	8955566	Good for you holding out, because there's some people that are too passive, probably myself included, that would have just ended up spending the points when the building thing was fixed.
8955586	8956407	I've been playing Call of Duty 4.
8956447	8957007	Got it anyway.
8959009	8959770	Burnout Paradise.
8960760	8963502	Actdeft says, Major Nelson covered this in his Twitter.
8963543	8965004	Maybe it's the person you think it is, Rob.
8966405	8976314	No, I know Major Nelson was responding to it, but I distinctly remember there were people on my Twitter like, Major Nelson who took it and he's just sitting in his bathtub wiping his ass with $20 bills.
8976834	8977395	With points.
8979256	8980236	I somehow doubt that.
8980276	8983858	The poor guy has to... Look, I do not envy what Major Nelson does, okay?
8983898	8987279	Because he has to take the heat of the entirety of the internet.
8987339	8989500	And it's not him that's screwing up.
8989680	8990120	It's not him.
8990200	8992181	I'm not saying they pay him.
8992661	8993161	That's true.
8993221	8994102	He gets paid to do it.
8994282	8995782	But I don't envy him.
8995802	8997323	Major Nelson's not really a person.
8997363	8999984	He's just like the voice on the computer in Star Trek.
9000004	9000864	That's all he really is.
9002005	9003585	And what you see is just a hologram.
9003665	9004946	He doesn't exist.
9006206	9007527	It's all a lie.
9008855	9009836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9035299	9057144	and there could be kids you know that don't have there could have been kids buying the stuff they don't have that much money you know I know no I there's definitely a problem out there it's weird that I haven't seen this on a lot of game blogs but then again if I see Call of Duty 4 in the headline or Call of Duty whatever world well you know I probably scroll past it so just because I don't play those types of games myself so
9058772	9060713	Alright, well, thank you for helping to get the word out.
9060773	9065515	And by the way, about Final Fantasy 7, it's very emo and I did not like it.
9066115	9066535	10 was better.
9067376	9068696	Out of curiosity, how old are you?
9069797	9069977	Me?
9070217	9070437	Yes.
9072618	9072638	I...
9073550	9074710	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9095078	9097400	I know, I know, but it doesn't stack up to today's games.
9097420	9101424	What I'm saying is that at the time, it was the shit.
9101524	9105368	Again, this is why I bought a PlayStation.
9106449	9107990	But again, it's not for everybody.
9108231	9108751	I admit that.
9109352	9112755	I don't think Final Fantasy VII by any means is the greatest game ever made or any of that.
9115678	9116378	Many sequels.
9116819	9117519	Makes me angry.
9117840	9119461	I like VII and I like X.
9120461	9121122	It is possible.
9121322	9122843	But I also liked Eleven for a little while.
9123323	9123743	Alright, anyhow.
9124044	9125805	Deathwishing, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls.
9125905	9128167	But thank you so much for calling and have a great week, okay?
9128227	9129508	Screw you, Microsoft.
9129648	9129988	Bye.
9130088	9130388	Bye.
9131189	9132390	Hope that stuff gets worked out.
9132430	9136973	That sucks that Microsoft is just kind of like... Especially the whole different responses thing.
9137093	9138835	That's kind of shady, in my opinion.
9138995	9139855	That's just kind of weird.
9140796	9142137	I think we'll do like one more call, guys.
9142157	9144639	Then we're gonna wrap up because it's like getting pretty late.
9144739	9145800	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9145820	9146100	Who's this?
9149056	9150137	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9150157	9150497	Who's this?
9152538	9154740	Is your microphone on, sir or madam?
9155260	9156121	They are not there.
9158002	9158522	I guess not.
9159103	9160163	I'll wait for one more call.
9161985	9162645	See what happens.
9164126	9165127	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9165147	9165507	Who's this?
9166147	9166548	Take two.
9166668	9167508	Is it actually working this time?
9167548	9168069	Yes, it is.
9168169	9169530	Hi, how are you?
9169890	9170530	This is Jason.
9170731	9172272	I'm 23, and I'm an addict.
9172692	9174433	Oh, I mean I'm a Final Fantasy VII fan.
9174533	9175133	Did I get that right?
9175754	9176194	Close enough.
9176454	9177055	What's on your mind, buddy?
9178166	9180828	No anti-fan wank about Scratch tonight?
9182010	9189676	Yeah, you know, I saw the story in the thread and then I kind of, you know, but here's the thing is that I figured we kind of already talked about it a couple weeks ago.
9189696	9193400	I love how everybody's describing the controller and I have a fucking picture of it.
9193540	9194240	It's awesome.
9194301	9201007	I know, I kind of feel like we already covered it, like that this new thing didn't really show us anything we didn't already know or did you catch something we did not, which is possible.
9201607	9202768	Thanks for watching!
9221097	9221738	Uh, blah.
9221798	9224500	Well then, don't worry about if you're covering something we've already covered or not.
9224520	9228543	Tell us what you think, because this show is all about the user interaction anyway.
9228664	9230245	You are a long time Bomani fan.
9230345	9234068	Obviously, I met you through such avenues as DDR Freak and all this stuff.
9234128	9235409	I know you're a Rabid2DX fan.
9235429	9236570	What do you think of Scratch?
9237190	9238712	Where every gamer has a voice.
9238732	9238752	I...
9241294	9244055	I have the same feelings for it that I do for Rock Band.
9244676	9246917	I've said this many times before and I'll continue to say it.
9247297	9248838	I've played a lot of Guitar Freaks.
9248878	9250239	I've played a lot of Drum Mania.
9250539	9255642	Guitar Hero was really fun and then Rock Band blew everything right out of the freaking water.
9256703	9257523	It's a great game.
9257864	9261726	Rock Band 2 didn't change very much, but it's a great game.
9263846	9265287	I've loved the Beatmania series.
9265387	9266648	I have played one of each of them.
9267589	9273774	Beatmania original, yes, Beatmania Game Boy as Black Wolf showed off on Friday Night Gaming two weeks ago.
9274815	9279659	I've obviously played lots of 2DX and I've played a couple of Beatmania 3s including some songs with the foot pedal.
9282478	9293128	The thing that's different with Scratch is that I'm not looking forward to the majority of the song list because based off what the trailer revealed for the artists, I don't care for a lot of those.
9293448	9294890	I don't care for a lot of those artists.
9296391	9299414	And I'm hoping they bust out some really good electronic music.
9299594	9300175	Not gonna happen.
9301291	9302812	Because it's scratching, that's why.
9302852	9307657	There's not a lot of scratching in Electronica, but they are trying to feature stuff that would work with that.
9309839	9325194	Something to put in perspective as well, and as much as this hurts to say, this game was not made for you, and it was not made for me, and it wasn't really made for fans of Bomani who are kind of ticked off that Beatmania never really took off here because of what some would argue was a poor first showing.
9325814	9326215	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
9340629	9344352	Yeah, and the American DJ scene is a lot different than overseas scenes.
9344772	9347074	I'm pointing more at, like, UK and European.
9347414	9347954	Very true as well.
9347974	9348495	More than Japanese.
9348635	9349175	Very, very true.
9349195	9351857	They're gonna put stuff in it as long as you can scratch to it.
9351877	9353558	I mean, that's basically gonna be it.
9353618	9355940	And I hate, you know, reading that.
9355960	9358101	Everyone's like, oh, it's such a ripoff of Beatmania.
9358221	9358882	Yeah, it...
9359342	9359983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9380884	9384006	You can actually do, except this, you're actually performing them.
9384707	9389589	If you did this on a turntable, a real turntable, it would sound exactly the same.
9389729	9398895	And again, it's hard to say without playing it yet, but I would say it's very similar to how a lot of people when they first saw Guitar Hero were like, oh, it's just Guitar Freaks.
9399395	9402397	But then when you actually play it, you're like, but it's so much better.
9403516	9409338	What made... Well, that's kind of a bad comparison only, and the Guitar Hero did play the same, it just looked a lot better.
9409819	9412960	Because it had the whole 3D landscape and static scrolling.
9413000	9415661	And had a song list way better tailored to the masses.
9416161	9417181	Way better tailored to the masses.
9417201	9418562	And I completely understand that.
9419002	9423424	It's just kind of disappointing at the same time, because I would really love a DJ Sim.
9423984	9428046	But, again, I'm not sure that I'm going to be a big fan of the soundtrack, and that's...
9428706	9429206	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9448797	9466748	and yeah and I think the thing everyone's like getting all like a big ass boner for fucking you know DJ Hero and we don't even know anything about it yet they have a teaser page and they're like oh my god it's epic it's a teaser page it doesn't show anything it's the first of it's kind just like Scratch
9467188	9467829	Oh, oh, wait.
9483886	9486487	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9509286	9515108	But it's going to be pretty awesome, and it really comes down to the song list and the marketing behind it.
9515148	9516448	They've got a good marketing team.
9516508	9522230	It's the marketing team of the Guitar Hero 2, and I think it's going to be really awesome.
9522290	9532712	And you haven't seen everything on it yet, and they're really going to start revealing a lot starting pretty much in April and on to the release, which was originally supposed to be in June, but now I hear it's sometime in the summer.
9532812	9534553	So, I don't know.
9536510	9541561	I have to reiterate, and I know you were talking, you targeted more the people who are
9541974	9543295	I really am looking forward to the game.
9568214	9568434	Great.
9568855	9569675	Absolutely great.
9569915	9570416	Baby steps.
9570876	9575760	Jason, we've got to wrap up and go so we can wrap up the show, but do you have any other parting thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9577722	9580464	I'm trying to think of something witty and nothing's coming to me, so I guess not.
9580664	9581845	Jason, when are we going to hang out again?
9581885	9583086	I haven't seen you in like five years.
9583426	9584087	You know, it's funny.
9584127	9589351	I was reading the stuff about E3 coming around again, and I kind of want to make that as a trip this year.
9589571	9590312	I think you should do it.
9590672	9593775	But I don't want to drive that long, and I probably would be driving.
9594335	9599317	and not to mention with the new house and whatnot, money, situation saving, blah, blah, blah.
9599598	9600718	I don't know, I'm trying to work on it.
9600758	9602859	We have some other ideas and I just need to set up and put them in motion.
9602879	9604160	The Southwest does have some steel deals.
9604600	9612544	Yeah, seriously, I think our tickets down the Southwest, because we're going down there for Nelly's birthday and for E3, is like $59 or $79.
9612664	9614204	It was ridiculous.
9614765	9619007	I flew to Burbank for $69 and that's like cheaper than what it cost me in gas.
9619767	9640381	and you guys would definitely be flying again to LA this year and not road tripping like we did yeah I haven't decided yet I might be road tripping I haven't decided yet if my husband comes with me then I'll be road tripping I don't know how much I want to get into my personal life but I might be going to Vegas right after for a personal engagement so if that's the case I'm going to fly oh I know what you're talking about they're reopening that?
9640561	9643603	I can't believe that that's cool
9644833	9646836	Anyhow, Jason, we've got to let you go.
9647417	9648859	If nothing else, you need to make it a point.
9649040	9649560	Bring Rai.
9649761	9650943	Come to Disneyland at some point.
9651872	9654794	That sounds pretty awesome, although I'm kind of a chicken on roller coasters, but hey.
9655074	9655915	Oh, it's Disneyland.
9655935	9657516	There you go.
9657576	9657956	That's right.
9657976	9658917	You tell them, Rye.
9658977	9662420	Okay, I am the world's biggest chicken on roller coasters.
9662620	9664961	And I get in the front for this damn thing.
9664981	9665382	That's right.
9665702	9667763	Me and Rye, California Screamin', front row.
9668244	9668684	Be awesome.
9668864	9671306	She'll enjoy that in about 30 seconds when it comes around.
9671326	9672107	I'm with you, Jason.
9672407	9674508	By the way, it's actually the sixth longest roller coaster in the United States.
9674528	9675569	Jason and Loki can hold hands in the back then.
9677435	9679796	Hey, we're not going to be able to go on rollercoaster rides.
9680137	9681998	All right, Jason, I've got to let you go, buddy.
9682058	9682538	Take care.
9682558	9682978	Bye, guys.
9682998	9683118	Bye.
9683138	9685700	What do you mean you're not going to be able to go on rollercoaster rides?
9687481	9687841	No reason.
9688081	9688382	Okay.
9688902	9689202	Anyhow.
9689843	9693165	Because I can't stand the adrenaline rush and Nellie gets sick.
9693485	9694946	She gets motion sick really easy, actually.
9695206	9695646	All right.
9695926	9697467	Actually, so do I, but not in the front seat.
9697487	9699588	You guys can just ride the fucking Pirates.
9699628	9701550	You can ride It's a Small World over and over again.
9701570	9703050	I fucking hate Small World.
9703751	9706533	When I rode in the middle, I'd get sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sitting in the front.
9706593	9707013	No problem.
9709884	9710184	Awesome.
9710624	9710864	All right.
9711224	9711524	That's it.
9711544	9712005	We got to wrap.
9712065	9715905	We're trying to wrap up, get out of here, and get to our afterbirth and all that stuff.
9715965	9717066	But we've had a wonderful show tonight.
9717086	9717446	Yes, Jamie?
9717606	9728468	I want to know who is interested in winning a TurboGrafx-16 with no controllers, no plug, no hookups, just a TurboGrafx-16.
9729088	9732029	And to go along with that, I have a Sega Saturn, the same deal there.
9732069	9733609	Because I have two Saturns.
9733629	9734930	Maybe we can sign them or something?
9735050	9735670	We'll sign them.
9736798	9740821	Even though I don't think our signatures are worth that much, but I'm sure some of our listeners would appreciate it.
9740841	9742122	Let us know in the mailbag who's interested.
9742202	9742603	I don't know.
9742623	9744364	There's people already saying me, me, me, me, me.
9744384	9744784	I'll take it.
9744824	9745064	I do.
9745705	9747807	Why the hell do you want our broken ass shit?
9747907	9748907	It's free shit.
9750389	9752090	Maybe I'll throw in some old E3 swag.
9752830	9755633	I have hella old E3 swag I'll throw in too.
9755933	9760837	We'll just have a win free shit from OLR and just send out grab bags of shit.
9760857	9761777	Bring your own plug.
9762038	9762678	Of shit.
9762838	9763719	B-Y-O-P.
9764800	9765100	Alright.
9765620	9766201	Lots of stuff.
9767156	9769960	Anyhow, not literal shit, by the way, you sick people.
9770320	9772463	Okay, last minute story, since I forgot to get to that.
9772663	9775126	DarkSakura, I think you said you had one that was a holdover from the mailbag.
9775407	9776208	Actually, that was it.
9776588	9777890	I have demographic 16.
9777930	9778651	I'm giving it away.
9779651	9780692	Loki, did you have anything tonight?
9800522	9805164	Good or bad, I'm not sure how you can take it, but it's supposed to come out around the same time as the movie, so within the next month or so.
9806064	9811846	Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 was announced, actually, I think last week, and there's some more information coming out about that.
9812346	9814067	The game, of course, is going to be kind of a port...
9815734	9820216	I don't know what Ninja Gaiden Black was to Ninja Gaiden Sigma, the first one.
9820656	9829740	Basically, they're going to take Ninja Gaiden 2 and they're going to add a bunch of stuff in there, including there's going to be Dead or Alive's Ayane in there as well.
9830360	9834222	They're going to bring back the chick from the first game, I think.
9834642	9840385	And there's also the female warrior from Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword, which is on the DS.
9840925	9841845	So that's kind of neat.
9842566	9842666	Um...
9843766	9850333	Filefront is shutting down, so no more patches and demos from that site, which is too bad.
9851314	9856280	Speaking of iPhone games, Nobi Nobi Boy has been announced to be coming to the iPhone.
9857101	9857801	That's scary.
9859163	9860024	There's another thing, too.
9860084	9863768	They were saying that Nobi Nobi Boy, I guess...
9864969	9866251	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9881230	9904208	and then Rob kind of alluded to it a little bit ago that we're going to be seeing some Final Fantasy titles on the virtual console including there's I think the cell phone game that they had was sequel to Final Fantasy 4 the after years as well which is pretty sweet and of course one that I know Rob was excited about Hello Kitty Online has been announced to be coming to the US how did we miss that on show roll tonight I don't even know maybe I'm waiting for the game to come out itself
9904748	9908329	and one other iPhone app that I saw a little thing on.
9908929	9916212	Apparently, there's an iPhone fart app that had apparently... Well, yippee!
9916572	9919353	Apparently, the iPhone phone app...
9920979	9925742	and Aromatic, and that's the maker of Pull My Finger.
9925762	9929004	Apparently, they're in negotiations to settle the dispute.
9929084	9942673	Pull My Finger, once upon a time, I guess, was an application on the iTunes Store and apparently was being overtaken by iFart, which has now done $200,000 in sales since its release.
9943954	9948857	And now they're, I guess, saying that it's been kind of...
9950780	9954222	Ripping off of one of the other, I guess.
9954883	9957164	And there's some patent lawsuits, I guess.
9958305	9958665	I don't know.
9959746	9963328	Really, it's a farting app for the iPhone.
9963528	9964409	Do we really need this?
9964649	9965229	No, we don't.
9965870	9966830	Can I answer your question?
9967931	9972394	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and we can wrap up and get the hell out of here for tonight.
9972834	9975836	DarkSakura.
9977237	9979779	My final thought is wine is tasty.
9981038	9982447	Did it help to chill the glass, Rob?
9983112	9983977	It didn't chill long enough
9985066	9986087	This isn't my favorite wine.
9986627	9989830	I can definitely tell leaving the bottle open really ruined the wine in a way.
9990250	9990550	Oh well.
9990850	9991331	Life goes on.
9991651	9992532	It was yummy on Friday.
9993692	9994493	Loki, your final thought.
9994833	10009724	My final thought is, and this is just kind of a PSA, but just remember that this Wednesday happens to be the first day of a certain month, namely April, which people like to pull pranks and announce fake things and whatnot.
10010025	10012727	So just be wary of anything that's being announced next week.
10013807	10016069	There's a very likely chance that it's going to be fake.
10016409	10020951	And most people, if they have something legitimate to announce, they're not going to do it next week.
10021091	10022672	So just be aware.
10024173	10026554	I got a thought for the contest of giving shit away.
10027155	10040142	If we wanted to take those things, the Saturn and the TurboGrafx, and take them to E3 and get Bobby and Scott and all them to sign it, then they might be worth a little more because they have all of our signatures on it.
10040182	10041603	And how often are we all under one roof?
10044089	10045291	Scott was on TV years ago.
10045571	10046813	His autographs were something, right?
10047013	10047314	I don't know.
10049137	10050839	We were on TV too, weren't we?
10050899	10053781	That's true, we were on the local news.
10054342	10057724	I was a wow expert on the news a few months ago.
10058705	10059306	Alright, forget it.
10059326	10059646	We're done.
10060266	10060727	We're out of here.
10060787	10061668	Have a great week, everybody.
10061688	10062668	We'll see you next week.
