00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, March 8th, 2009

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Are Xbox Elites on their way out?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
New Kingdom Fighters 12 details are revealed

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
And are our boy in this blob set to make a comeback?

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that podcast, radio show dedicated to video games

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you every week

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Here on All Games Radio

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time Live

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
And joining me as always say hello to the one and only

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yo

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
How you doing DarkSakura?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Mmm, interesting

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, interesting?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Interesting

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Okay, I get interesting good or interesting bad

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Because interesting is a very, uh, interesting term

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Interesting neutral

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Okay, fair enough

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Suddenly I feel like we're talking about D&D alignments or something

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
You're chaotic interesting

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
It's funny, I took a D&D alignment test

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
And I had taken the same one before

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Right

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
And I came out chaotic good before

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Last time I came out true neutral

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
But, you know, feelings change

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
How long ago was it that you took the test?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
About a couple years ago

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
People change, you know

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
People sometimes shift their political ideals

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Over years and years, you know

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
People change

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
We change our opinions on games

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I remember a time on this show

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
We've been doing this show a long time

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
About seven years, right?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
And I remember a time on this show where it was like

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Xbox was the butt of all our jokes we ever made on this show

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Like the ginormous controllers of the original Xbox

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
And now Xbox is pretty cool

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
I think all of us can agree

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
360's got a lot of great stuff on it

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
So it's just interesting

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Right, Tech Master Loki?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
And it's also not the size of a house

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
That's right

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
How you doing, Tech Master Loki?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Fine

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
You have a good week?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah, it was a pretty good week

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I understand you finally got to Airsoft today

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yes, finally

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
How was that?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
It was fun

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I don't know, we played like three games

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
We played at a different place than normal

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Because I didn't want to drive an hour to where we normally play

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
So we played at a field next to my work

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And it was pretty nice

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And there's lots of rocks

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Because people might not know

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
But Folsom used to be a big mining town

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
And, well, they used to dredge and stuff in the river

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
And there are piles and piles of cobblestones

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
All over the place out there

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And that's all the ground is, is cobblestones

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Thankfully there was some dirt on there

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
So it wasn't so bad

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
But there's cobblestone hills that we were on top of

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
And there's a bunch of eucalyptus trees that they planted there for some reason

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
So it's like a big jungle out there

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
First person shooters for real, right?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yep

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I got to try out one of my new guns

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
And it's so awesome

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
My other guns, my older ones, not so awesome

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
And of course there's always you guys who join us here every week

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
On Orange Lounge Radio when we tape live

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
And you can join us in our chatroom live chat.orangeloungeradio.com

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Or on the Game Surge Network for you IRC fans

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
At channel Orange Lounge

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And the first comment tonight from Shadowrunner

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Xbox is awesome until the Red Ring of Death and then it's fail

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Good point

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
You know, the Xbox has taken a lot of crap for the Red Ring

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
And sure, Microsoft's, you know, kind of done the whole

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Oops, our bad, we're going to extend the warranties and all that on that

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
But it makes me think of an article, if I can work in a cheap plug here

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
For the new orangeloungeradio.com website

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Which has actually been, you know, thanks to our new writing staff

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Has had a pretty constant stream of new articles

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I got to say it's pretty awesome

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
One of them was written by Bresloll earlier this week

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
And he was kind of talking about, is it just me

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Or are these new console systems just not built to last

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Like the old ones

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Like he was kind of saying, you know, I could probably still find a Nintendo that works

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Or a Super Nintendo that works

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And come to think of it, you know, I was kind of reading the article

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
And, you know, yeah, I don't think I ever, ever had a console break

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Until the Xbox 360

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
But then there's also another argument that says, well look

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Consoles broke all the time, you just didn't hear about it

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Because now the internet culture, you know, one person's console breaks

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
In a, you know, over the top way

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
And it hits every game blog on the internet

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And, you know, millions of people read about it

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Kind of different interesting schools of thought

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
But, I don't know, you know, old school 8-bit NESs might still work

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
But you still have to blow on the cartridge

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
And blow in the system to get it to work, you know

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Unless you're lucky enough to have a top loader

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, with the 360, it's basically praying that it's not gonna break

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Because, you know, it's like if you look at it funny, it's like

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm gonna die now

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I hope you're happy

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
I know, you just kind of hope that it's gonna last, you know, the full three years

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Well, it's just like the 360 that I fixed that's modded

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm just surprised each day that it works

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Because it's like, there's no reason that this should work, but it is

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Every day is a new gift

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Yes, exactly

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
GS68 in chat says, hey, some of my Super Nintendo games don't work anymore

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Here's what I'm curious about

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
Does those batteries, remember how batteries were only supposed to last like five years

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
The batteries that they have in like the Zelda games or the battery backup

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Did anybody ever read the fine print that those things were only supposed to last five years

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I wonder, do some of those still work

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I've never heard of those batteries really failing

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
My Zelda cartridge finally died

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Did it really?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
It did

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Also, the same batteries, the lithium batteries are used in the Sega Saturn

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Mine have had to be replaced a couple times

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Wow

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
BlackWolf, plugging his other show in chat

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
We learned on Friday Night Gaming that blowing on the cartridge actually does nothing

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
It was the readjusting into the cartridge slot that fixed it

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
See, I always thought it was the moisture that you, when you were blowing on the cartridge

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
It was the moisture from your breath that was helping with the contacts

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
That's what I always thought was the

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
The moisture would corrode contact

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh, interesting

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
We used to just take alcohol swabs

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
It all depends on how, what condition your console is in

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
You know, in your games

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
If you leave your games out and they're super dusty

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Then blowing in it, I can imagine, would fix that a little bit

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
But yeah, usually it was the contacts on the inside that were really dirty

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And thankfully they did have the NES cleaning kit

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
And you could, you know, do that and then you see the contacts and they come out all black and you're like, wow

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
One more comment from chat and then we'll get to how was your gaming week

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
We have Say in chat says, I've only ever had my PS1 break caught on fire

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
I can't, I would freak the hell out if that ever happened when a gaming system

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Can you imagine a gaming system like catching fire?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Dude, what did you do with that system?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Was it like a 48 hour Final Fantasy 7 marathon or something?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Like how does your system catch fire?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Or maybe it wasn't properly vented, I don't know

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
But, you know, because some of those systems

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Or he poured gasoline on it and set it on fire

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
I don't think that would be a, you know, whoops mistake

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I don't know

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
Alright, let's, breaking these consoles in all these intricate ways makes me think back

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Do you guys remember the SmashMyWee.com or whatever it was

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I could be mistaken

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Where they stood in line all night long to buy a Wii

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Only so they could break it

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah, they'd be there all the time

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
The novelty is worn off

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
What a bunch of assholes, yeah the novelty is worn off

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Now what they should do though

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And I totally approve of this

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Is like smash my scion or something

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Something more expensive that it takes a while to smash this

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
You know, like you can actually do some serious damage to it

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Because, you know, and what they do is get people to donate money so that they can go smash it

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Why are we allowing these people to have the fun of smashing something

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
You know, I want to be able to smash something for free

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
Wow, and Sage just followed up in chat, it was some 24 hour thing

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So, there you go

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Alright, let's get to how was your gaming week

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week, what kind of games did you play this week

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I played Ragnarok online and that's about it

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Getting back into the Ragnarok, huh

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
Off and on, I've really been spending a lot more time doing, reorganizing our video game collection at my house

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Which is actually what my husband is doing right now

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
We have a lot of games, a lot of games

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Didn't you upload some of the pictures to our picture feed, I thought

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Just one of the stacks, and that's like a small part of the vault

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
We've actually moved out a lot of our boxes into the garage and are going through everything

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And Dan found all of our Guilty Gear figures today

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
And a few Mega Drive cartridges and stuff

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Awesome

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
I found our copy of Policenauts

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Wow, that's random

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
Hey, I got a question, I haven't asked this in a while, what ever happened with Ragnarok 2, I haven't heard anything on that in a while

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Did that ever like release

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I don't care

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
You weren't a fan

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Still in beta, I don't care

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
After all this time, it's been like beta for like two years

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
How long was the first Ragnarok in beta

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I guess that's true

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
You played with me in the beta

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I remember, yeah, it was a long time ago

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
With your mage with a bow

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
Deathwishing in chat at chat.org.com says Ragnarok is way too confusing

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
What do you think this guy is doing wrong

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Maybe he didn't translate the game yet, I don't know

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Is it confusing, is it hard to get into

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Is it about Ragnarok 2 or the first one

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
No, the first one

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
The first one is not at all confusing

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's really easy

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
I mean, it's just a matter of using common sense and combining your skills and what matches what you want to do

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
If you want to be a fighter, you can either go strong, tough, or fast

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
But it's also a different kind of game, right

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Because if you go to this game after playing something like, I don't know, Warcraft, it's different

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
It's easier

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Ragnarok Online is infinitely easier than World of Warcraft

09:47.000 --> 09:58.000
But the thing that I think that people don't like about it is that you don't have someone holding your hand and allocating your points for you

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Maybe it's because they expect you to fucking use your brain to allocate your points

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
You know

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Alright

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Am I right or am I right?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
It's been so long since I've played, I honestly can't tell you

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I don't even remember how the damn game works

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I remember the porings were really cute, that's what I remember

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
World of Warcraft

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Well, I wouldn't say it necessarily hand holds you and how to distribute your point

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
But here's the thing, Warcraft is so infinitely popular

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
You can go onto websites upon websites to tell you how to build your character

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
And then you get these, you know, elitist raiders that if you don't shape your character a certain way, then you are suck

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
But in the end, it's all basically your armor

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Or the stuff you've got on you that controls it

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
In Ragnarok, it's if you kill creature, creature, creature

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
You can go put all of it in your intelligence and have a mage, you know

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Intelligence and dex

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
If you want, like say if you're playing an assassin

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
You put it all in your agility, a little bit in strength and a lot of it in dex

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
And boom, you can hit and hit a lot

10:59.000 --> 11:09.000
So, you know, and on top of that, your armor and your accessories are all in addition to what you do

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
So it's not really that confusing, you just have to know what you want

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
Blackwolf in chat, if I wanted to use my brain, I wouldn't rot them away playing a video game

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
He says with a little hint of sarcasm

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
I played loss and damage

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And that's it

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
Just multiplayer, I didn't get around to doing much of anything

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm trying to figure out why that was

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Oh yeah, I remember now

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Because I was trying to hack the loss and damage and it's fucking hard

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
So, yeah

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
So no luck there

11:51.000 --> 11:59.000
Because apparently they have these SHA-1 hashes in a file

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
And if you change one byte of the file, it changes the whole hash

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
So you have to figure out where they need to be updated and for what blocks

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
It's so complicated that it just fries my brain thinking about it

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
But I want to do it because you can edit it just like the PC

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Because it has the same format and stuff, so that'll be fun

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
But yeah, that's pretty much that

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
And then I did find my DS Lite finally

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Buried amongst the stuff that was on my coffee table

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
And so I kind of went through there and I'm going to be playing some games on that now

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
So, hopefully I'll have a little bit more to play

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
And I know next week for sure I'm going to have some stuff to play

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
I'm getting from work a Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Killzone 2

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Not that I'm really excited about it because I don't give a shit about Resident Evil

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
But I'll play it anyways or whatever

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Killzone 2 looks interesting, I wasn't going to buy it though

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
So thank god I don't have to pay for it

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
But Mad World, holy shit, I can't wait to play that game

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
So that'll be one I'll be playing next week

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
But lots of fun stuff coming up

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
My gaming week, I didn't have time to play a whole lot

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I did check out Quake Live for a brief little bit

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Now that the queues apparently aren't such an issue

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
The first couple of days you try to get in there

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
You had these queues that were thousands of people long

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
It's just like, yeah right, you're not going to get in there

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
But finally I snuck in there one night and got to play

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Because I think they finally eliminated the queues

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Or really opened up the servers or something

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Or the fever just died down, so it's really easy to get in there now

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
So I did play for a little bit

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
I was surprised because I don't know why

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
But I was under the impression that Quake Live was a new version of the original Quake

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
It's not, it's based off Quake 3

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
Even the same voice and all that stuff

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
So I was pleasantly surprised

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I like how it does that skill match in the beginning

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
In the very beginning when you sign onto Quake Live

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
You have to play a 10 minute match against a computer opponent

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
That gets a little harder as you start kicking her butt

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
And then it gets a little easier if she starts killing you a lot

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
So it's supposed to skill match you with other opponents

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
So considering the whole thing is free

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
It's definitely worth checking out

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
If I suck really bad on that then I could play really hardcore against noobs

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I would think so, but I would think that as you do that

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Your skill rating is going to go up

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
So you don't get to do that for very long

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
I would imagine there's people

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
So I actually tried

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Because I was thinking, oh I should just suck at this

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
So I can just get matched against really easy players

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
So I can feel better about myself

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
But then I thought no, because there's going to be a lot of other people thinking that same thing

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
So I'm going to just actually try

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Because I know I'm not that great at Quake

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
And it was an even match between me and the computer opponent

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
So it was just kind of fun

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And some comments from chat

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Tigerclaw says, Quake Live also works in full screen

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
And that's true, Quake Live does run pretty well in full screen

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Tigerclaw says, it's Quake 3 minus the blood and gore

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah, the blood's missing and all that stuff

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
But again, it's all free in the browser

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It's very hard to complain

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I had a good time with Quake Live

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
The little time I spent with it

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I want to go back and revisit it

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I also played some Rock Band 2

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Because I love me some Rock Band

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I spend an obscene amount of money on new songs

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I don't know why I waste my money like that, but I do

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I was like, oh, I have to play No Doubt and New

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
And I really want to play White Zombie

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I have two drum sets and I use neither of them

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Oh my gosh

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Maybe I should borrow one

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
I need to get my drum achievements

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I don't know

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
I've got one, it's the wireless one with the cymbals

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I have the cymbals for it

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Really?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, and they're kind of, eh

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I might have to

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And I have a drum bag, or a bag to carry the drums

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I was thinking about getting that little portable one

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I don't know how well they work

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Don't get that

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Is it terrible?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
It looks like crap

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Well, I don't know, but I like the idea that it doesn't take up all this freaking space in my house

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
You know, you kind of just put it out on the table and play

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Seriously, if you got a bag for the drums

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
The one that they actually make for it

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
It doesn't take up that much space at all

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
It's like a small suitcase

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
And you can just put it down somewhere

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
I have my one set broken down in that

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
And then I have my other one that if I were to play Rock Band

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I would use that set, but

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
They're both at work

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
So I don't, you know, because I've run out of space in my house

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And here's the other thing

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Also in my gaming week

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I downloaded the demo for The Last Remnant

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
But I haven't checked it out yet, so

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I don't know why I mentioned it

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
But I'm going to check that out this next week

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Because I'm curious

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
If it's really, really good, I might just get it on 360

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
But I'm also kind of curious how it's going to run on PC

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And then also

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I wanted to go back and play Civilization 4

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Because, you know, after video games live and everything

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
And seeing the little slideshow

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I was like, oh, I need to get back into Civilization and play this game again

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
So I remembered it was on GameTap

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
So I went to GameTap and found it in their library

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And tried to launch Civilization 4

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
It doesn't work

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Because it doesn't work in Windows Vista

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
And come to find out, quite a few of their games don't work in Windows Vista

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Also come to find out, GameTap's going through some major changes

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
In the next couple weeks

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
As they kind of shift to their new ownership or whatever

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Whatever, I got this email about new pricing arrangements or whatever

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
And, you know, I'm locked into their current ones

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
So I'm not going to get shifted or whatever

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
But I don't know if I really like the direction GameTap's heading

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I have to be honest

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
You know, as a fair critic

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I don't know if I necessarily like

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
And I can't really judge until it happens

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
But now they have this whole thing where the arcade games

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Are going to actually be playable in the browser window

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And, you know, some of the classic games

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
And now some of the other stuff

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Like, they're kind of turning into this hybrid of Steam

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
And, like, what sounds to me like Pogo games

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
And, like, I don't want to pay for Pogo games

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
You know what I mean?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
So, I don't know

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I'm going to withhold my full judgement

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Until it comes out

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
But, I don't know, I'm just not happy either

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
That, like, some of these things just won't work in Vista

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
And I understand the games are old

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
They were made for a certain Windows system

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
It's my fault for being stupid and having Vista

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
But, look, that's what my computer came with

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
So that's all I have

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I keep seeing advertisements for good old gaming

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
It's a, I don't know if it's a website

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
It's like Steam or something

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
But they have, you know, older games in there advertising

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Rise of the Triad on there and stuff

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
So I think that's kind of neat

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
That they have the old games

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
If they would run or not

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Because I know Duke Nukem 3D, for example

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Won't run on, you know, XP

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Unless you've got, you know, something special for it

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
So, I don't know

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Dr. Tetsuya in chat says

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I agree, we haven't used it in a long time

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Especially since they're all about PC ports nowadays

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Now, you know, call me stupid if you want

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
I don't care

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
I made an impulse buy a few months ago

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Not that you've ever made impulse buys, Loki

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I bought a full year of GameTap up front

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
So I'm locked into this thing for a year

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Whether I like it or not

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
So, at least, you know, I'll have a chance to give it a full review

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
And maybe it'll win me over

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I just don't like what I'm hearing, that's all

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
So, you know, I kind of look at these changes

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And I go, oh boy, alright, I'm going to have to see this in motion

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
But, you know, I guess in the end it is all about the games

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
And if they can make it so that Civ 4 will magically work in Windows Vista

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I don't know what they have to do

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I imagine if they emulate all these old games, there's got to be a way to do it

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Civ 4 is not, like, an obscure game

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Couldn't you run it, like, say in the compatibility mode with XP or something like that?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Run GameTap?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Possibly, I haven't looked into how it works

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Oh, I finally got to

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Maybe there's a listener that's thinking, Rob, you're so stupid

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
There is totally a way you get it to work in Windows Vista

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
But then again, shouldn't GameTap just kind of be able to tell me that?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
How about compatibility mode?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I just said that

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah, I don't know

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Well, I finally got to use Vista

19:02.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah, I had my wife's co-worker want me to find her some stuff to put onto her system

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You know, all legit software, of course

19:13.000 --> 19:20.000
So, I hate Vista. It sucks really bad

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
It's just, the hand-holding stuff really pisses me off

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I disagree

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I don't know, I'm iffy on it

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
These compatibility type issues make me a little irked with Vista

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I think I'm more looking forward to the new Windows than I am

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
I'm kind of like, uh, Vista's a stepping stone for me

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I don't like Vista now

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
My system is completely tailored around running it

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
So, that's just how it was when I bought it

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
So, it runs like a dream on my computer

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Yeah, it's fast

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I mean, on my computer, it's well optimized and everything

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
But it's just, I don't know

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
I disabled all the touchscreen stuff because it was fucking with my tablet

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And I disabled a few things here and there

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
But then again, I've always tweaked XP to get it to run how I want it to

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I tweak every OS I get my hands on to make it run the way I want it to

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
And guess what? Right now, my Vista runs like XP with a few goodies

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
But I bet you wouldn't be able to play Civ IV either

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Actually, I probably would be able to

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
If you can get it to work, let me know

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
City of Heroes gave me compatibility issues and I just changed it to run in compatibility mode

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
And boom, no problem

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
I'll check it out, maybe it is something that simple and I'm just being stupid

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
All it did was change my resolution

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
That's certainly a possibility

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
And then it changes it back when it's done

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Alright, we'll see

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I'll try it, I'll try it

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I'll try to dig into compatibility mode

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
And then I'll get all those emails this week, you idiot, it was super easy

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
And then GameTap will email me, you idiot, stop talking negative about our service and you can't figure it out

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But at the same time, I would think

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
If GameTap is going to give me an error message about not being able to start the game

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
It should tell me, hey, you should think about running in compatibility mode

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Of course it could have been right in front of my face and I was just too pissed off not to see it

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Anyhow

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Alright, let's get into

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Yeah, next link in chat says I have Civ IV and I run it off Vista

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
So I don't know

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, we'll see

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
I can fully admit, look, I'm not the biggest computer genius in the world

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
I can just get Civ IV, you know, so that you could play it without GameTap

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Maybe that's what I'll be forced to do

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Because I will feel that sense of entitlement

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
That's right

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Not stealing

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
GameTap forced you

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
They forced you into this, okay

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Alright

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Let's move on with the show

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
We have some housekeeping to get into

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
And then we're going to get into tonight's show

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
Hey, I'm over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com right now live tonight during the show

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Orange Lounge Radio March Madness The Elite 8 is wrapping up right now

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
And check that out

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
You can vote

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
There's some pretty epic matchups going on in the top 8 right now

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Final Fantasy VI vs Chrono Trigger

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Before the show tonight, Chrono Trigger was leading

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
But, you know, a lot can change

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
That's a pretty epic matchup

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
So you can go vote in that

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
And the Final Four will be announced a little later tonight after the show

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
And keep an eye on OrangeLoungeRadio.com for that throughout the week

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
Also, we have some more people writing on OrangeLoungeRadio.com

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
And now we have some new segments that showed up out of the blue that I'm loving

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I heart that song

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
They've actually kind of been, I guess, using the classic game of the week a little bit as an inspiration

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
Some of our staff writers have been writing these tributes to great songs in gaming

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Which has been kind of cool

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
And, you know, just some other great segments on OrangeLoungeRadio.com

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Very happy with the direction the new site's going

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Alright, I guess that's it for housekeeping

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Don't forget, you know, LiveJournal, Facebook, MySpace, all that good stuff

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
Well, there's interesting stuff coming out from Microsoft

22:44.000 --> 22:51.000
You may remember last year during August that they did the, what was it, Summer of Arcade

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
It was a promotion where they had a bunch of really cool arcade games coming out back to back

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
You know, each week there'd be a really highly anticipated Xbox Live Arcade game

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
Well, I don't know if this is exactly the same type of thing

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
But they're doing one that's going to start on March 18th

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
It's the Days of Arcade promotion

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
I don't know why they couldn't have done Spring of Arcade

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
But Days of Arcade

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
And similar to the event that happened last year

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
They're going to have a bunch of different games coming out

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Starting with the release of Hasbro Family Game Night

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
And if I remember correctly, I think Hasbro Family Game Night is actually like five different games

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
Yeah, it is. It's like Sari and a bunch of the old classic games

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
So I don't know if on the 18th they're going to get like five games all of a sudden

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
But whatever

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
Also coming out will be the Dishwasher Dead Samurai

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
Which, if you remember, was that really kickass XNA game

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Finally now an actual game

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
Flock, which was Capcom's kind of sheep herding type of game

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
Outrun Online Arcade, which is pretty awesome

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Puzzle Quest Galact...

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Like Old School Sega Outrun?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Yes, like Outrun

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Could be fun

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Puzzle Quest Galactrix

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Uno Rush

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
And Lode Runner

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Those all sound pretty awesome, actually

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
You know, I don't know though, I don't get the same thrill out of Hasbro Family Game Night

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
That I did out of like Geometry Wars 2

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And some of the things that came out in the summer

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
But I understand

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
Xbox has a family friendly niche they need to fill pretty badly to compete with Nintendo

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
So I'm okay with it, I understand why they need stuff like that

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
It all depends on what games

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I can't remember what they had in the Hasbro Family Game Night

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
If they actually had, you know...

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Battleship might be fun

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Well also look, what's like the number one Xbox Live Arcade game

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
After all this time, like Uno

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Maybe not number one, I have nothing to back that up

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
But it's still like in the top five at least

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
After all this time, Uno is still there

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
You know, tons of people still play Uno

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
So you can't say that there's not a demand for something like this

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Especially if it's well done, so you know

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
And the Hasbro Family Game Night sells really well in every other system that it's out on

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
So I can see that

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah, I can see it too

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
There's a lot of love being lavished upon Galaga Legion in our chat room

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Son of Dad says Galaga Legion was the best last year

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Sonic M88, I loved Galaga Legion

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
That was a pretty good release in the last batch too

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
No I didn't actually... I think I downloaded that

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I'm not sure if I bought it or not, but

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
I downloaded it and played the demo, it was pretty cool

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
But that was like right around the same time that I also got Space Invaders Extreme on my PSP

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
And I just kind of ended up playing that instead

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Yeah

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
I think didn't Duke Nukem 3D come out during that time too?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
I think it did

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Yeah, I think that was one of the big releases too

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, that was another one like Doom where I was like

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Oh my god, it's Doom!

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And it played multiplayer online like once

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
And I was like, okay I'm going on to other things now

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
But aren't they making a Galaga Legion 2?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Didn't we have a story on the show a few weeks ago about that?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
That they're doing a second one?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
I don't know about that

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Some type of other reiteration of Galaga?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I don't know

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
It would be pretty awesome if they did

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Hey, the Xbox Elite is being phased out apparently

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
This is the rumor going around the internet this week

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Apparently the Xbox 360 is going to be more of like a limited edition type of console

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
It's not going to be so readily available

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
It's because retailers are not as happy about the Elite apparently

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
You know, the economy the way it is

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
A system that costs what, $200 more than the entry level system

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
It's not doing too well

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
So apparently Microsoft might actually be limiting the console sales

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
To only select retailers across North America and Europe

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
Apparently the Elite might just phase out altogether in Quarter 2

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah, I don't know about that

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
I mean, at least as far as when I'm selling it

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
We have tons of it on hand

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
So it won't be going away anytime soon

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
But I know they do

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
And some thought is that maybe they're phasing this out in favor of

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
The Elites will be out for the Resident Evil 5 Red Box Elite system

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
And then when that phases away and the next big Xbox game comes out

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
There'll be a limited edition system for that

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
They could be treating it like Sony's doing with their higher end systems

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
Like the 160GB system now that's bundled with the game

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
They may be doing that

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
And I can see, because right now the Elite by itself doesn't seem like a great deal

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
But when you have the Resident Evil Elite there

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
You get an arcade game and you also get a game with it for the same price

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
So that seems a little bit better of a deal to me

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
And yeah, I can totally see them doing a Halo ODST game

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
And bundle and I don't know what other games they have coming out in the pipeline here

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
I know this is such a cliche bitch about the Xbox 360

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
But how about a quiet edition console?

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
I might pay an extra $100 for a freaking quiet Xbox 360

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I mean, especially compared to the Playstation 3

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
Which, you know, obviously it has its own shortcomings

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
But one thing, it's freaking quiet

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
That's why you install games to your hard drive

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Even when you do that, you still hear the vroom

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
You don't hear the drive spin up

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
But the machine itself is incredibly loud

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
Well, it's either that or it red rings on you because it overheats

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Would you rather it be loud or would you rather it be dead?

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
I would rather they just fix the problem and redo the console or whatever

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
You know, Sony does it with the PS2 and the PS1

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
You can hack in there and manually change the voltage of your fan

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I shouldn't have to hack

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
They should just do it

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
And then it'll be nice and cook food on it and stuff

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I don't know

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Open the case on it and take the fans out, I don't know

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I don't want to break the damn thing

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I just want it to shut the hell up sometimes

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Because it's kind of loud

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
They should make a fan case that would go over the loudest parts

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
Or something, or a noise filter, I don't know

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
Maybe you should find some sort of noise trapping material

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Like some sort of...

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Like how metal would reflect a rubber mat or something

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
To put underneath it

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Or maybe finding a different type of...

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Some cabinets that you can put your systems in

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Actually can put a glass window in front of it

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
With just the little thing for the cords and that kind of filters out the sound

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
I don't know

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
Or you get the integrated audio video setup

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Where it's actually a plug in your wall

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And you put another one in another room

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
And then you put your system in the other room

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Since the wireless controllers can reach within 30 feet

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Then you go, it's another room and you don't have to hear it

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Or I could just fucking deal with it as I have to

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
Yes, that's definitely the way to go

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
But then I can't hear the game

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Or I could get headphones

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah, that's another thing, headphones are good

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Or you set it next to a PC that's even louder

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
And then it doesn't matter

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Like the Orange Lounge Radio PC

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Oh, that's nothing compared to...

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
I don't know if you can hear the monster fan on this thing

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
It is... I have the loudest...

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Have you seen my PC?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Not in a long time

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
With its 200mm fan on top of it

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
And it's got like, you know

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
8 different fans that are on it

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Plus there's 3 more inside the case

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Plus there's a fan on each of the graphics cards

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
That are also hacked to be 100% all the time

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
It's like a jet engine

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Alright, I don't want to bitch about noise anymore

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
People are probably sick of it

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
But I do want to read a comment from chatroom

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Because this made me lull a little bit

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
The comment from chat was from SonOfDad

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
Says, Hannah Montana Xbox 360 Elite Skew for me please

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
PSP's doing it

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
There you go

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Baby, baby poop purple

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Xbox 360

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
If you want to join us in our chatroom

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Well you know, Rob, that her new movie

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
She's gonna have to choose

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Whether she's gonna be Miley Cyrus or Hannah Montana

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
How about she chooses to go jump in a lake

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
That would be...

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Or deaf

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
She's deaf

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Amazing

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Alright

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
If I can't be both then I won't be any deaf

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I'll just have to chop myself in half

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Alright

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Let's move on with more gaming news please

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Do not let Loki ruin my show with Hannah Montana

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Dear God no

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
Well how about something that I'm sure a lot of people have been waiting for

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Rob, maybe you've been waiting for this, I don't know

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
What's that?

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
The Beatles on Rock Band

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Actually it's the Beatles Rock Band Edition

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
A collaboration between Apple Corps, Harmonic, and MTV Games

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
And it's going to be all Beatles music

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
They're basically saying that they don't have any plans yet for downloadable content

31:32.000 --> 31:38.000
But it is going to be stand alone, dedicated, just to the Beatles

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
So no importing your songs into other rock band games or any of that stuff is what it seems to imply

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
It's going to be all by itself

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
Which you know, it's the Beatles, they can do that

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
They're like the biggest band ever

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Ever

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
And if you doubt this, of course I'm excited about a Beatles rock band game

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
I mean especially more so than some of these other bands

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
We've heard Metallica, Aerosmith, I'm sorry they're not the Beatles

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
They're good bands in their own way but I'm not as excited about that as the Beatles

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Songs have lasted forever, sorry

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Actually you're also going to be doing a limited edition premium bundle for $250

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
On all platforms, that would be Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
That will have instruments modeled after the ones that the band actually played

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
So hey, that might mean Hofner bass

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
That's a little excessive for me

32:27.000 --> 32:33.000
I wouldn't get it but I can see where collectors and hardcore Beatles fans would be all over that crap

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
So that's not a surprise

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
For me, I just want the game

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
But that's good for that audience, that they're doing something like that

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
But yeah, I think this game is going to be pretty epic in that regard

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And if you doubt that the Beatles are still huge

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
One site I finally started using again this past week was last.fm

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I know we have an Orange Islands Radio group on last.fm

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
If you haven't seen it, it's linked from our site

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
But I finally re-signed up for this site because I was trying to discover some new music

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
And if you look at the top bands that are played on last.fm

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
The Beatles are still there in the top ten

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
And that's all the music out of anywhere

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
So if you doubt that the Beatles are still huge

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
You're wrong

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
But Miley Cyrus is bigger

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
No, Miley Cyrus is not bigger

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
At least according to last.fm

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
Granted, not everybody on the planet uses last.fm

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
But it certainly

33:22.000 --> 33:29.000
$250 seems an awful lot of money for, I don't know, Beatles rock band stuff

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
I mean, am I going to get part of some of the Beatles corpses in there?

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
Or the hair that you used to get, that they used to sell

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
No, I can understand why it's going to command a higher price

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Because they can get away with it

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
There's going to be people that are willing to pay it for the Beatles

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I just probably won't be one of them

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
But I'm still excited about the game

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
Did you hear the controversy on how people think that the Wii version is going to be $59.99 for just the software only?

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
They're like, $59.99? What the hell?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Everything is only $50!

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
That is the cap for Wii games

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Not $59.99, it's $49.99

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Says who?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Well, says the world

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
I don't know

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
I think back a long, long time ago on the Super Nintendo to when Street Fighter II came out

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
If I remember right, I could be wrong

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
But if I remember right, Street Fighter II when it first came out was like $79.99 on the Super Nintendo

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
That was, I mean, and this was years ago

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
This isn't counting for inflation, granted in the current economy

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I think we're back to where we were when that game came out

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
But all that aside, you know, $79.99 was a lot of money

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
And it certainly was more money than you were seeing for other games at the time

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
I believe a lot of Super Nintendo games at the time were going for the $49.59

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
No, I think they were like $39 or $49 back then

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
But I remember Street Fighter II especially was very expensive

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Maybe it was only $69.99

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I just remember it was much more expensive

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
But it was Street Fighter II!

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Who didn't want to buy that game back in that day when that first came out?

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
I honestly don't think it's going to come out for $59.99

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I think that's actually a misprint

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
But whatever, people are going to stick with it for now

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
And they'll have a big controversy

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
But I don't see a lot of people picking it up for $60 if that's the case

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
Even if it is the Beatles, because who gives a shit?

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
It's the Beatles

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I know I'm not picking it up

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I don't give a shit about the Beatles, so whatever

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
A couple chatters are correcting saying it was $69.99

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Maybe there's, I'm thinking like $70 in my mind

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
Rama says Sky at Toys R Us it was $69

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Local Shops had it for $79

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And Game Guru says it was $69.99

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Son of Dad said it was $69.99 at KB Toys

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I don't know how you guys remember that

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Or if you just looked it up on the internet real quick

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
But still, still, they don't charge $69.99 for games now

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I can't think of any games that aren't collector's editions that go for that price

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
So you know, I'm just saying

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Who's to say they can't charge whatever they want for the game

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
If they know it's going to be in high demand

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
And that people are willing to pay that for

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
You know, what is arguably going to be a premium game

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I mean it's not like we're talking about

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
You know, Carnival Games 2

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Trying to command a price of $59.99

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
We're talking about the frickin' Beatles

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
So, you know, I don't know

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
I won't buy it for the Wii

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Why are you talking crap about Carnival Games 2?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
I don't know

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
I want to know

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
I'm not talking crap

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I'm just saying I won't pay $69.99 for it

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
Carnival Games 2, it's worth that kind of money

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Interesting comment from Marissa Cungusto in the chat

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And I know that's the lovely Marissa

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Who hasn't been on our show in a long time

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
But I think she needs to grace us with her presence again sometimes

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
True Beatles fans are more nuts about the music than gimmicks

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
But people do get nuts

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Look at all the Elvis crap

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Interesting perspective

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Alright, let's move on

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
By the way, the release date of this game, 9-9-9

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
Ten years after the release of the Dreamcast

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
What a fun day to release stuff

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
And I believe, as I was hearing on a Bobby show earlier tonight

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
One of their chatters said something

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Final Fantasy VIII was out on that same day too

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
So September 9th is a fun day

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Really?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
9-9-9

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Final Fantasy VIII was out on that day too

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
No, I think it was out on September 9th of a different year

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
It's not the same

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
It's not quite the same

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
Anyways, so there's another rumor

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
Honestly, this isn't actually a rumor

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I've seen it

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
Activision is preparing to release Guitar Hero Van Halen

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Later this year

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
August, to be exact

37:25.000 --> 37:31.000
And it will be coming out, of course, with some of the more popular Van Halen tracks

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
You know, Jump, Panama, Hot for Teacher

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
And also other bands' music are gonna be in there

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Just like the Metallica stuff and Aerosmith

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
How can you have Jump without keyboards?

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
How?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
I don't get that

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
How can you do that without keyboards?

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
I mean, I know, but I always thought of Jump as a keyboard song

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
In fact, there's a local store in town

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
I don't remember if it was Guitar Center or Skip's or one of those stores

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
You had the keyboards all on display at the store, right?

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
But they had these big songs that the following songs are banned

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Do not play them on these keyboards or we will kick you out of the store

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
One of them was Jump

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
You couldn't play the chords

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Like you couldn't play it, like that and for release

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
And all the other stuff

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Like they would kick you out of the store if you played that

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
That's hilarious

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
It reminds me of that scene from Wayne's World

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
No stairway, tonight

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Exactly, it totally reminded me of that

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
No stairway, denied

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
No chopsticks, I know chopsticks had to be one of them

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
Other stuff, other songs that might be in there as well

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Juice Priest's Painkiller, Tenacious D's Master Exploder

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Which you might remember was from Rock Band 2

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
And Weezer's Dope Nose

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
Of course, this is all to be taken as rumor right now

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
But no, it's not a rumor, it's actually coming out

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
It's gonna be just like Guitar Hero, Metallica

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
So expect that later on this year

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
However, that is not all that you can expect later on this year

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
Cause that's one of the millions of different Guitar Hero games that are coming out this year

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Well actually Hero games

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
Including the previously announced Guitar Hero Modern Hits

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
Also supposedly this year, Guitar Hero 5 or whatever they're gonna call it

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
Band Hero, how that is any different than Guitar Hero 5 is beyond me

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
Another Guitar Hero on tour game for the DS and DJ Hero

39:26.000 --> 39:32.000
I guess they weren't kidding when they were talking about the whole 5 Guitar Hero games in a year or something like that

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
I think it's a little overkill if you ask me

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
But I know I'm not buying any of these, except for DJ Hero maybe

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
That's a maybe

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Marissa in chat again says it's true about Stairway, try playing it in Guitar Center

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
I don't doubt it, I'm sure they would get very angry at having to hear that song

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
It's just like I hear on American Idol, certain songs are banned from the auditions too

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Like you can't sing Alicia Keys' Falling in your audition

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
I don't know why I know that, I must have read it on Wikipedia or something

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
Robert M on the last story makes it funny about the release date of the Beatles Rock Band game

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
The Beatles Rock Band release date, number 9, number 9, number 9

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
It's kind of a real nerdy joke there

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
It's also the same day as The Nine is released by Tim Burton

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Which looks awesome

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Is that a game or a movie?

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
It's going to be a movie and a game

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
Oh of course, I had to ask, of course if it's a big movie it's going to be a game as well

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
I thought the next Tim Burton movie was the Alice in Wonderland movie

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
No, the Nine is the next one

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
Unless Alice in Wonderland, I don't think Alice is coming out this year

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
No I think it's out in 2010

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
I love Alice in Wonderland and all that stuff, I'm really excited about the new movie

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Anyway, more Guitar Hero

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
And this is a follow up to a story we reported on a couple, probably a few months ago at this point

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
I'm sure our FUs of the Week came right after this particular story

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
Do you remember when Gibson sued the makers of Guitar Hero?

40:50.000 --> 40:59.000
That's right, Gibson had sued over the whole patent they had on musicians simulating participation in a concert

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
And all this stuff, like they tried to claim basically that they invented Guitar Hero

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Even though Guitar Hero worked with them to make the controllers or what have you

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Well guess what?

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
It was lost, their patent suit was lost

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
And essentially was practically laughed out of court

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Is what happened with that

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
Let's see, this was from the US District Court for the Central District of California

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
Let's see, the court said it's toys that represent other items there

41:28.000 --> 41:35.000
Also apparently Gibson's patent only originally applied to devices which use the analog audio signals

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Not MIDI signals or any other types of control signals

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
So, there it is

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Suck it Gibson

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
Yeah, it was a little bit silly of them in the first place as we discussed previously

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
But I guess you could say justice was served

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I guess you could say they hacked the Gibson

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
Aha, aha, aha, give me that

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Sad trombone

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
Well, while we're on the subject of the guitar games, whatever

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Guitar Hero Greatest Hits will be out in June

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
And should have 48 songs, including Them Bones by Alice in Chains, Killer Queen

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
Killing in the Name, Through the Fire and the Flames

42:21.000 --> 42:29.000
It's basically pulling songs from the other Guitar Hero games and putting them in one game

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
I guess the only cool thing about this is that now they're gonna get the band treatment

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
Like I was reading somewhere that Through the Fire and the Flames is supposed to have crazy hard drums on it

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
To match the crazy hard guitar part

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
But still

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I wanna play the vocals for that

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
Still, if you listen carefully, listen carefully

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
And you might be able to hear the sounds of this franchise getting milked to death

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Cause that's what's happening, I mean really

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
It's a slurping noise

42:58.000 --> 43:06.000
That's like, okay, the other day I was looking on iTunes

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
And they have like greatest hits for like Wilson Phillips

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
Wilson Phillips had what, like two big songs and two CDs

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
Does this really necessitate a greatest hits album?

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
That's how I feel about this whole Guitar Hero thing

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
Is there really enough out there that necessitates this Guitar Hero Greatest Hits album?

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
How about this for more milking, Rob? It's gonna be out on Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, and PS2

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
I'm not surprised though, all the Guitar Hero stuff is milked on all the systems

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
But seriously, it's amazing, you go into stores now, like Fries and Best Buy

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
There's an entire aisle practically dedicated to these games now

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
And I mean it's because they sell, obviously

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
And because they're huge, like literally the boxes are huge

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
One day though, one day the bottom's gonna fall out from this market

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
It's gonna be kinda sad

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
And it's gonna be Activision's fault

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
Don't be like Konami, don't hoard DDR

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
I just, you know, again, at least bring a keyboard or something like that

44:05.000 --> 44:11.000
And Rama says in chat, Sky, if Rick Astley can have a greatest hits album, so can Wilson Phillips

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Good statement, good statement

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
That could possibly be the chat comment of the evening, we'll see

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Alright, let's get into some release dates from around the world, lowkey

44:19.000 --> 44:24.000
Alright, well in the US, we have a few games coming out this week

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Starting off with Stuff for the Wii

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
And features Mama from Cooking Mama

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
Except now she's working in a pet shop

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Is there anything Mama can fix?

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
I don't want to know

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I need Mama to fix my life

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
I don't know, maybe she's hunting for ingredients

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
We need Relationship Mama, that's what I need

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I need Mama to fix my dating life

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
That's what I want, no I'm kidding

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
It's a weird game with some giant mushroom, I don't know

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Can we say that again?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Docomo Dake Boing

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
Trivial Pursuit coming out on Playstation 2

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
Mad World on the Wii, that game looks awesome

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
Gotta love a game with chainsaws

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
And yes, that's an awesome looking game on the Wii

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
That is what we just said, yes

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
World in Conflict, the complete edition on PC coming out this week

Red Xbox 360 Elite System

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
Some praise for Mad World in chat, Lazy Days, Mad World looks cool

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Deep Man, can't wait for Mad World

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
It's nice to see a Wii game getting some fanboy lovin'

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
There you go

47:12.000 --> 47:17.000
It's got John DiMaggio in it, I mean the voice of Bender

47:17.000 --> 47:23.000
And Greg Proops from Whose Line doing sports commentary while you murder people with a chainsaw

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
What more do you want?

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
That's pretty amazing

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
I randomly met Greg Proops like years ago

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
It's nice to see that he still do it, because he had that game show

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I met him right around the time he had that game show going on

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
And then that got cancelled, and then Whose Line wasn't on anymore

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
So I'm really glad to see he's around still

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
It's so awesome

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Can't wait to play this game

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
You need to bring it over, I want to check it out

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
I don't know enough about this game, but you follow the chainsaw

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It's like the Running Man meets Sin City

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
You follow those types of games better than I do, I will readily admit

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
Anyhow, let's move over to Japan and check out the Japanese release dates

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I'm being distracted though with pictures

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
The Dark Sakura is showing me of her old cosplay

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
I actually found a lot of old photos that I'm actually sorting through

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
And going to throw away the really bad ones

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
But I just found my pictures that I took at a cemetery in Alabama

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
There was one of you cosplaying as Emi though, I thought that one was really cute

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
This particular photo that I will go and put on the camera in a second

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
Is from the Churchreach Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
Of the only Revolutionary War veteran buried there

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
So that means that he had to have been listed when he was 15

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
Lots of love for Greg Proops in our chatroom apparently

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
That's awesome!

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
We should try to get him on the show or something

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
Nah, I don't know about that, that's like stretching the boundaries of you

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Well, why not?

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
He's a voice actor in a video game, maybe he wants to sell the game

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
If the game does well, he'll want him back for a sequel

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
You never know

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Alright, anyway, forget it

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Let's move on to some Japanese release dates

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
Coming out in Japan, of course since we're getting it over here

48:56.000 --> 49:01.000
You know Japan's gonna be getting Resident Evil 5 over there

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
Actually, I think that just came out this last week

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
Yeah, it came out last week

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
But, they are getting, I know this is new

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
The Idolmaster Twins is new on the Xbox 360

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
Idolmaster is a pretty big franchise over there

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
And now it's got twins

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
So, on the Playstation 3, Army of Two gets a price reduction

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
As it goes into EA's best hits collection as does Need for Speed Pro Street

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
But if you want to get some new games in Japan, Resistance 2 is actually new for Japan

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
In some DualShock packs

49:28.000 --> 49:34.000
Musou Orochi Z is coming out from Koei this week as well

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Over on the Playstation 3, and Skate also getting a price reduction

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
Phantom Brave Wii is coming out this week on March the 12th

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
As is Sonic Tokunokishi comes out as well

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
I'm not sure what this, oh this is Sonic and the Black Knight

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Over in Japan

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Wii Cheer gets its release in Japan this week as well

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Because I know you guys can't wait for a Wii Cheer over there

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
And Boku to Sim no Machi Party comes out as well from EA

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
My Sims Party

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Is this My Sims Party?

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Yeah

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
That is, that is

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
Also coming out on the Playstation 2, Galaxy Angel 2

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Need for Speed Pro Street getting a reduction

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
And that's it for the Playstation 2 this week

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Let's look at the handhelds real quick on the Nintendo DS

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
Tokumiki Memorial Girls' Side First Love Plus comes out from Konami this week

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
Also coming out from Konami, or I'm sorry, a price reduction for Survival Kids

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
Also coming out Konami Dual Spirits, the DS game

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
Actually that's another price reduction, I was going to say that game's been out a while

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
The Sims Party game also coming out from EA on the DS this week

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
Retai Picross comes out from Nintendo this week

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
First party game on the Nintendo DS

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
And quickly looking to see if the PSP is getting any love this week

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
Well they are, you get Ever17, the Out of Infinity Premium Edition comes out from Cyberfront this week

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
As well as Never7, the End of Infinity

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
Resistance Restribution also coming out on the PSP this week

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
And that looks to be about it, unless you're looking for a price reduction on Need for Speed Pro Street

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
So that's it for the Japanese release dates

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
Well how about some UK release dates, as soon as I set my photos down

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Sure, let me read a quick chat comment while you're doing your photos

51:16.000 --> 51:23.000
AcidicVampire in chat says, when I play Wii Cheer, I actually attach streamers to my Wiimote to make them feel like real pom poms

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
You joke, you joke, but they sell those things for the Wiis

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
I was going to say, I'm surprised they don't sell those

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
No, they do sell those, they sell Wii pom pom attachments for your damn remotes

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
Yes, people are that retarded

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
I kind of want one for some reason, but I'm going to make mine

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Well remember, you can use it for every game, so you know

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
Because I want to play MadWorld with my pom poms, yay, go cheer, cut you in half

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
That's hilarious

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
I'll put this on the camera in a moment or if you want to do it for me

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
This cat is 27 years old

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Oh my heck, alright, get to the release dates

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
Okay, let me give you the photo, his name is Sean

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
That's my cat from Alabama

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
Anyway, coming out on

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
I think he's a zombie

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
That's the only way we can explain that he's lived that long

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
He's alive by the power of evil

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
I've already said last week on the 8th and 9th that Flock was out

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
The 10th, Tomb Raider, Underworld, Lara's Shadow on Xbox 360

52:28.000 --> 52:34.000
Bleach Dark Souls, Codename Panzer's Cold War on PC, Persona 4

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Oh, by the way, those last few were on the 13th

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
Resident Evil 5 on the 13th, Resistance Retribution

52:40.000 --> 52:47.000
Ocom, Frontation, Sonic and the Black Knight, Tom Clancy's Hawks on PC

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Cool

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
Tigerclaw just linked in chat

52:52.000 --> 52:59.000
Sorry, I just saw a picture of those stupid attachments

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
Oh god, I almost want them just for the sheer gayness of it

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
I feel like I need to own it

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
I don't know what it is, but I'm just compelled to purchase it

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Even though it only has a 1.5 star rating

53:11.000 --> 53:18.000
Dude, $19.99 for two little pieces of plastic that you tape on to the ends of your Wiimotes

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
That's amazing

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
We finally got a SKU for the Wii Music Instruments

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
They have attachments for all those too

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
So you can look like a douchebag playing those

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
I want to point out, Amazon looks like they're having a sale

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
You can get that and a Wii Cheer and All Star Cheer Squad

53:35.000 --> 53:41.000
Play together $84.97 for the Ultimate Cheerleader Pack

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Oh god, alright

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Waaaaaame

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
Anyways, there's going to be a new Pac-Man game on the way

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
This is to celebrate the game's 30th anniversary

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
Good lord, you know, I remember just a few years ago when we were at E3

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
when they were celebrating the 25th anniversary

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
Now, of course, the 30th anniversary will become 2010

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
So, not surprising there

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
And, no word on exactly what it is

54:11.000 --> 54:19.000
I guess Namco Bandai, America's Makoto Iwai

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
said, as a group, we feel that we should do something to make him come back

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
So there's one project that we've started working on

54:27.000 --> 54:33.000
And I guess Yasu Hara is part of it

54:33.000 --> 54:39.000
And says the new game design was sort of meeting his wish 100%

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
So, I have no idea what the hell that means, but it's going to be a Pac-Man game

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
So, set your expectations low

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Well, I mean, the last Pac-Man game that came out was really awesome

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Pac-Man Championship Edition is pretty great

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Even Pac-Man Versus was pretty fun too

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
But, yeah, I mean, not every Pac-Man game has been a winner

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
It's Pac-Man, I mean, it's like

54:58.000 --> 55:04.000
If Pac-Man ran faster, we'd be having the same problem as Sonic

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
But, uh, I'm kind of curious to see how they're going to reinvent Pac-Man

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
There are Pac-Pics, that seemed like a good idea

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
I love Pac-Pics

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
Until you played it, then you're like, wow, this sucks

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
Yeah, Pac-Pics, it was one of those things that was neat in a small dose

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
Like, it was a great demo to show the DS off with

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
But, as a game, eh, nah, didn't hold my attention

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Pac could roll, that was kind of lame

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
You know what, Pac-Man, that Pac-Pics game

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Like, you know how they're doing this DSI download service

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Where games are only going to be a couple of bucks

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
You know, their whole little digital distribution thing

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Pac-Pics would have been a great candidate for, like, a little $5 game there

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
That would have been, I think, where it would have been best served

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
But, obviously, they didn't have that at the time, so whatever

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Um, anyhow

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Just found a picture of Jason

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
What? Our webmaster Jason?

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
How old are these pictures? What are these all from?

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
E3, O, almost

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
O4, probably, right?

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
Yeah, I found a really bad picture of us

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Oh, boy

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Oh, I remember that picture

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
That's blurry

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
I look cute

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
Alright, hey, talking about pictures makes for great radio, doesn't it?

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Hey, uh, Konami

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
You know our friends at Konami, they are turning 40 years old this week

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
If you can believe it

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
You're over the hill!

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Congratulations, Konami, you're old

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
No, Konami has officially turned 40 this week

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
And, uh, quoting on the age of the company and how they did it

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
The European president, Kuno Nio, says

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
Consistency plays a major part in everything Konami does

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
I don't know if that means, you know, rehashing their games over and over

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
No, I'm kidding

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
Obviously, Konami's put out a lot of great games that we've loved very much over the years

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
So, there you have it

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
Konami also promises that there are a wealth of other new titles in development

56:44.000 --> 56:50.000
By the way, a game that I left out of my gaming week was the DDR on the iPhone

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Was a game that I actually played this week, the brand new one

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
They have DDR on iPhone now

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Um, it's alright

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
You know, considering it's DDR on your iPhone

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I mean, you don't actually dance

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
But, um, here's the thing

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
There's this new mode they have called shake mode

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
Where you actually play DDR by tilting your iPhone to the left and to the right and up and back

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
You know, which is kind of stupid but cute

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
But here's the weird thing

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
You only can play the tutorial song in shake mode

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Like, is that a bug? Seriously?

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
Like, you were only meant to play the tutorial song and nothing else?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Like, did somebody forget to put that pointer in that says

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
Oh, after the tutorial, go back to the song select and not the main menu

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
So, I don't know

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
A little strange

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
But, the game has a lot of songs, I guess

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
You know, it's got like 26 songs or something like that

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
But you only have like 9 to start

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
You have to unlock them all slowly but surely

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
And I don't know, I hope there's an unlock code or something

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
Because I don't know if I can stand to just play these songs over and over again on the iPhone

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
But, you know, it is a lot of newer DDR songs

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
There's some old ass stuff mixed in there

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
But here's the thing that surprised me most

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
Did you know Brilliant To You now has a vocal version?

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
It's kind of scary

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
That's all I have to say

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Like, I've been out of the DDR loop for so long

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
I had no idea there was a Brilliant To You now with vocals

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Is it voluntary singing?

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
No, it's not voluntary, it's a dude

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Or is it that really awful dude that like

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
What was it, did that crappy rap that was in uh

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
It could very well be for all I know

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
But, yeah, there's

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
You know, DDR music is interesting now

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
It's, you know, back in my day

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
It was a lot different

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Getting these kids off your damn lawn?

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Although, there was a Naoki and Smile DK song that was kind of cool

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Because like, hey, Smile DK, you know

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
They kind of weren't around in Bamani for a long, long time

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Well, there is

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
There is new DDR coming out

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Like, later this month

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Yeah, there's the, what, Hottest Party 2?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
No, it's Disney Grooves

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
That's right, the DDR Disney

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
I keep getting emails about another one too that's still in development

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
I thought it was another Hottest Party game

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
No, well, I'm sure there will be another Hottest Party game of me

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Because they keep putting that crap out

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I don't know, it's just

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
Can't be excited about this stuff anymore

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
I will be more excited about DDR when there's something that's really reinvented it

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
You know, I don't know, even just going to different versions of music

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
I have a way to do it, but no one wants to give me the money to do it

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I know

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Alright, let's move on, some more gaming news

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
Enough reminiscing about the past 40 years of Konami

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
But, but, but, but, but we like the past

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Yeah, that's true, and I think back to the Konami of the 80s

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
The old school Metal Gear game was amazing

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
But anyway

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
Well, how about some different news

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
Ubisoft has actually pulled a game called I Am Alive

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
That's being developed by Darkworks

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
From their lineup

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
They announced it at E3 that they wanted to release it

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
This spring, but it's actually been delayed until March 2010

59:49.000 --> 59:54.000
Because it's apparently such an ambitious title that they want to do it justice

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
So, let's hope so

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
It was funny though, actually they announced it

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Yeah, it's coming out in March

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
And they're like, uh, yeah, about that

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
It's actually financial year 2010

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Oopsie

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
We jumped the gun there

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
So, sometime between now and March

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Sweet

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Anyways, there's something else that's kind of interesting

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
You remember we talked a little bit about it

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
That Square Enix was starting to buy up some shares of Eidos

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Well, Square Enix is hoping to finish buying the rest of Eidos by May

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And they're actually expected to approve a deal with the Eidos shareholders

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Later this month

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And hopefully by May 6th

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
There will be, I don't know

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I guess they'll be under the ownership of Square Enix

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
That's kind of interesting though

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Because my thoughts are, why would you want Eidos?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I mean, really, it's Eidos

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Well, they do own Tomb Raider rights

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And there's a new Tomb Raider movie coming out

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
So maybe they're going to try and do a different type of Tomb Raider game for it

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I don't know

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Maybe try to reboot some of the franchises

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Doesn't Eidos also have, uh, is it Hitman that they have?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Yeah

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
That was another big one they have

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
You know, that was a fairly successful number one movie

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I suppose

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
They have some big franchises that just need a swift kick in the butt

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Well, maybe they can just pick up this company

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
So that they can just develop straight RPGs for, you know

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
From Square Enix

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And they all have to worry about branching out into other games

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Because they can have Eidos do the other game genres

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Now what are we going to call them?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Game Guru in our chat room suggests Squeenix Titos

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You know, here's funny though

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
They actually had it on this article here

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It's Square Idocs

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Game Guru in chat says

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Square Enix wants franchises that aren't JRPGs

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And that could be, you know, there has been those stories

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
About they want to get more into, you know, the more American style of the game development

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So why not?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah, but I mean, this is about like half a step from, you know

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Buying out Atari or something

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I mean, no offense, it's just like

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Eidos is not what they used to be

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Tomb Raider is definitely not what it used to be

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And, you know, there are other franchises, you know

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
The ones that they still put out aren't what they used to be

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And they haven't been really that great

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Well, they obviously see something in it that maybe they can turn around

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Maybe that's why they're able to buy them out

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Because the shares are so low

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I don't know, it's just

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Whatever, I mean, if you're Square and you've got lots of money then

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I guess it's fine to buy out Eidos

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Well, hey, this game company seems to be doing something right

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Because apparently, according to Nintendo Power's recent issue

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
A boy and his blob is coming back on the Wii pretty soon

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
That's kind of cool, this is coming from WayForward

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Is the company that's making this game

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Now, you might remember a little while ago

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
They were kind of testing this on the DS

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
There was a DS version of the game that was under development

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
But then it ended up getting cancelled

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I remember playing this at E3 going like

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Wow, it's a boy and his blob

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
But now, apparently

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
It's going to be reinvented on the Wii

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And there's more information in this month's Nintendo Power magazine

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
So that could be interesting

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Remember a boy and his blob?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Yes

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
It's kind of a neat game

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
A little bit of a short game

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
But, you know, back on the NES

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
It was kind of okay

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Because it took a long time to figure out how to beat it

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And get a cheat guide

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
But this could be kind of cool

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I don't think it's a remake of the first game though

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I think it's probably a whole new thing

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
But it definitely was an interesting concept

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
If you don't remember what a boy and his blob was

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Basically, it was kind of a puzzle game

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
You had the blob and you were the boy

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And you could walk around and the little blob would follow you

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
And if you fed the blob different flavors of jelly beans

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Then the blob would turn into different objects

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Like the blob could turn into a ladder

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
The blob could turn into a trampoline

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Or a key

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
You know, it would just basically shape shift all these different things

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So you were kind of

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
It was a puzzle game basically

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And you really had just enough jelly beans

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
To figure out the answer to the puzzle

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And get to the exit or whatever it was you were doing

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So, it could be interesting to see how this plays out

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
In, you know, many many years later

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Or what, probably like 20 years since this game was first out

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
It does look really cool that it's all hand drawn

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Yeah, that could be very cool

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
So

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Hitstun in chat points out the way forward also made Contra 4

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
So

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Dark Tetsuya asks about the brick wall trick

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
No, I don't remember that

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I do seem to remember there was a really easy way you could cheat

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
In Boy and His Blobs, that must be what he's talking about

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Dan Shadow asks, is Jelly Belly paying for this?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I don't know, it could be a good sponsorship

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I love Jelly Bellys

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
No, they have Jelly Belly ballistic beans

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Do they really have a game like that?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They have a game that's coming out in April

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
In April or May

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
It's Jelly Belly ballistic beans

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It's like, um

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Bust a move

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Um

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
You know, the

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Puzzle Bobble type of game

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Um, you know Jelly Belly

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Doesn't make the Harry Potter beans anymore

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
They, uh, I guess lost the licensing agreement with that

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
So now they have their own, like, sad flavor of Jelly Beans lined

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Like, have you ever had those nasty Jelly Bellys?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Like in the, you know, vomit flavor and all that stuff?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Blah

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I love Jelly Bellys

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Anyway, alright

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Sorry, I guess the Boy and His Blob story is making me hungry

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Uh, we're almost to a little break here

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
If you are craving food

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
We just have a few more stories to get through

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And then we're gonna be taking a break

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And of course we also have the classic game of the week

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Which we'll be getting to in just a little bit

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
After a few more stories

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Right, Dark Sakura?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Right, Rob!

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Hey, hey

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I actually just saw something that made me laugh

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
That I'm gonna post in the chat room

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And what is that, may I ask?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Here, look for yourself

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Okay

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Hold on, let's see

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Someone did a parody of what the Watchmen ending was gonna be like

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Oh, is this gonna spoil the actual movie?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Cause I haven't seen it yet

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
No, Rob, it won't

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Hahaha

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Candy Mountain

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Yeah

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Nice

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Okay

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
That's fantastic

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Sorry, that's terrible radio

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
It's bas- nevermind

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
At least our live listeners can look at that

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Anyway, um

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
How about some UK Virtual Console stuff?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And this makes me happy

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
It's fun stuff

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It's Clu Clu Land!

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
We remember Clu Clu Land

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I do, I remember playing it in Animal Crossing on the GameCube

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Yep, and I played it on the Nintendo when it was new

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Back in the day

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Um, basically you just have to turn bubbles and make gems and stuff

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And it's 500 Wii Points

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And then Mega Drive title

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Wonder Boy 3 Monster Lair

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
So, um

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Which I think as we got it was Wonder Boy Monster Land

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I think we just got that on Virtual Console ourselves over here too

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Yeah

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
That's 800 Wii Points

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
So, go get em!

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Go get em!

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
280 games for the Virtual Console available now

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Yeah, then I'm not interested in any

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Oh my god

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Unfortunately

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
That's a lot

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Still no Guardian Legend

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
You wanna know what?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I probably have that many in the vault

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I wish I was joking

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
No, I wouldn't doubt it

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It's just, you know, a lot of

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I probably have that many ROMs, no I'm kidding

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
You know kinda why I wish I was joking?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Why?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Cause we're sorting them all

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Fun

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Lord

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
You need to get some big plastic bins

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
We got em actually

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Well, while I may not be interested in

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The Virtual Console

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I am interested in something else that's coming out on the Wii

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
That would be Excitebots Trick Racing

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And we actually got some details on it

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Other than just a name now

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
We have pictures of the box art that came out

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Which looks interesting

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Which was promptly stolen and put all around the rest of the internet

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Yeah, because I don't give a shit

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
So, whatever

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So anyways, yeah, box art

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Which shows robotic animals

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Yeah, with wheels and stuff

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
That's kinda neat

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Another interesting stuff

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Before I was kinda worried

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
The description made it sound like a party game and stuff

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
It actually looks like Excite Truck

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And it looks pretty sweet

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Although there is weird stuff in there

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Like there's a robotic turtle carrying a tambourine for some reason

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And I'm not sure why

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And then there's some other stuff that I saw with like

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Throwing pies at clowns and stuff like that

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So that's weird

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
But it's still Excite Truck

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Can I throw rocks at clowns?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
No, just pies

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
But they're big pies

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
But it's just

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
They're rock pies?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
No, they're big pies

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
But the game basically plays very similar to Excite Truck

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
It's based on a star system

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Not necessarily

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
You can get in first place

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Obviously helps you

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But if you don't get in first place

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It doesn't really matter

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Because it's all about who has the most star points

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
At the end of the race

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And you get points for doing different things like

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Tree runs

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Catching air, doing air tricks

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Jumps, whatnot

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
So very similar to Excite Truck

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
The controls are going to be exactly the same

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And they've added a few different things in there as well

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Now they have these new energy poles

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
That you can swing around

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And gain a boost off of that

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Lots of fun stuff

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And then there's also some other game modes in there as well

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Hopefully optional

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
That you can play poker by

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Driving through cards

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Based on what you get

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
You get points on the hands

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And then also the clown thing

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Which I don't know how that plays

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
But you basically throw a pie at a clown

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
As you're driving around

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Nonetheless

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
It looks interesting

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
They've got vehicles flying through the air

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And stuff like that

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Plus you get a power up where your character

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Is able to run with its legs and stuff

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Any word about internet play like Mario Kart?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
There was no word on that

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
But as I remember mentioning before

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Two to six players online

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Interesting

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And one to two players split screen

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Local

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Very very interested in checking this out

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And the wife is extremely excited

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
It looks interesting

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
But here's the thing about it

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Didn't we hear that this developer

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Was working on something that was so secret

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
They had to have the secret screens and all this stuff

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And I don't know if maybe somebody was just embellishing it or whatever

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
But I'm really thinking in the back of my mind

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Is this game really that big of a deal

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
That they had to keep it super top secret?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It looks good

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
It really does look good compared to Excite Truck

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And actually the graphics are a lot better

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I don't know, I'm very interested

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
To check it out

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
They could have a really good game on their hands

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I think the robotic lizard

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Frog thing is kind of cool

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
They're going to have a mouse in there that they can play as

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
A robotic mouse, but the turtle looks retarded

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I'm sorry, he's got this retarded

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Look on him

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Like he's been touched in the head or something

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I don't know, but

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I don't have to play as a turtle

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And there's also Ladybug that flies through the air

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Alright, well some

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
New details about another anticipated Wii game

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Has hit the internet this week

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
It's about Punch-Out!

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Punch-Out is coming out in May

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
But apparently some other new details have leaked out

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
About the game, including the fact that some

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Of the best of the original Punch-Out!

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Cast will be returning

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
King Hippo obviously was seen in some screenshots

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Glass Joe is going to be in there

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Von Kaiser apparently is going to be making a comeback

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Not exactly one of the fighters

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I would have thought would be the best of the original

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Which started Make Me Fearful

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Because I think somebody said on this show a couple weeks ago

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Maybe this is just going to be a complete remake of the first game

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
No, they're actually going to have new characters in there

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
It's even says

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
There's going to be some new characters in the game

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Star Punches are coming back into the game

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
No word on how you get them yet

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
But that could be interesting

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
By the way, Punch-Out! is also going to have two

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Different control schemes

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Of course there is the one

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
That will be the whole, you know, waving your arms

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Around in the air, but apparently

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Also classic NES

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Style controls

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
If you flip your Wii remote on the side

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And play the game, you can play the game that way

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So that's kind of cool

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
For those of us that don't want to flail our arms around everywhere

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
You can still have some fun with Punch-Out!

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So there you go

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Well, obviously Punch-Out!

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Is a very classic video game

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
But we like to put the spotlight on the classic game

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Every week here on Orange Laundrio

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And I can tell you this week it's not Punch-Out!

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
But it is some game that you should definitely be checking out

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And it's Dark Sakura's classic game of the week

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
She's going to dig through her archives

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And pull out a game

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That she wants to share with all of you

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic video game

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Of the week this week?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
The classic game is Plio Plio

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
It is a puzzle game

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
That was created

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
By Compile for the MSX2

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
It actually uses

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Characters from

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Mado Monogatari

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
So it's just a fun little game

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
That's where you drop

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
These bean shaped thingies

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And have to match them up

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
But you can do drops

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
And make chain combos

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And I think it's been

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
One of the

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I'd say

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Blueprints for many other

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Puzzle games to come out since

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Sort of like Puzzle Fighter, remember?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Where you had your chains and everything

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Basically

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It's

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
We got it in the US as Puyo Pop

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
And we first

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Saw it though as Dr. Robotnik's

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Mean Bean Machine

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Genesis and Good Drive

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Came out of Game Gear and Master System

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Which that version actually came out in Europe

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
And Brazil

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And then we got it as

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Kirby's Ghost Trap

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Which was the

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
European SNES version

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And Kirby's Avalanche

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Which was our version of it

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
So

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Basically

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
The whole point of it

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Is that you have to stack up

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
The Puyo

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And you have to

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Match them up and

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Get them in certain combos so that

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
You can throw that many

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Number of lines

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Over on your enemy

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Who is also playing simultaneous

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Either the enemy or the computer

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And they can block your moves by getting

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Combos of their own, but basically

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Whoever has a higher combo

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Then they get to

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Sit over there, it's actually called

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Rensa

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
The chain

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Of how they pop and fall

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Is called Rensa

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
So you can have any different kind of

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Variety of it for how they fall

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And the blocks that fall on the other side

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Are called

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Ojama

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Which are garbage blocks

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Or as we get them

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
They're new sets of Puyo

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
So

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Basically, like I said, the higher that you get

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
The more that you drop on your opponent

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
That they do not block

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I'm sorry, this battle I'm watching on YouTube

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Is quite epic

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
My god, these players are amazing

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
They're setting up chains left and right

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I have seen the 19

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Chain

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Rob that someone managed to get

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
That's pretty freaking epic

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And actually this version of the music is from Puyo Puyo 2

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
That I thought was cool

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But basically

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
You've got single Puyo

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Where basically you just fight the computer

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And then you have the versus mode

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Which is double Puyo Puyo

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
You've got characters in the game

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Which we've seen a few of them in other games

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Because actually, Carp Uncle made his way

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Made a brief appearance in Dr. Robotnik's

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
B&B machine

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And it was called Has-Been

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
In that game

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
But you have

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Maja who is the main character

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Blue girl with brown hair wearing a blue dress

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
And um

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
You also

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
You know, also some of her chains

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
She calls out different spells

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Because her character is apparently a sorceress

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And then you've got Carp Uncle

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Carp Uncle is cute

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And then

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
For the first Puyo Puyo

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
You get Skeleton Tea, Nasu Grave, Mummy

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Drako Centauros

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Sukeidodora

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Um

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Skia Podes

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Harpy

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
You actually have Zombie too

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Which I think is cool

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And my favorite name here is Zodamaio

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And your boss is Satan

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And you have to fight him

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Because he likes Arl

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
But he really likes Carp Uncle

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
As far as other versions

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
That have come out

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Like I said, we've had the US ones

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
That was Dr. Robotnik's

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
BB Machine, Koopa's Avalanche

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Um

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
They're uh

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
They actually say that the

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Puyo were

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Supposed to be like how the

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Slimes were in Dragon Quest

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
They're actually from that

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
RPG game Madou Monogatari

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Which if anyone's played it, I'd love to know

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Um, I haven't

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
But anyway, as other games came out

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
There was the

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Puyo Puyo Pocket

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And you had your Pocket Color one

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
So we've had Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
We've had Puyo Pop over here

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
In Japan it was Vina De Puyo Puyo

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Which means Everybody Puyo Puyo

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Um

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
We've had Puyo Puyo Sun

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Which there was actually a Nintendo 64 version

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Puyo Puyo Sun 64

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And a Saturn version

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And Puyo Piyon

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Which was um, pretty much the second one

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
We also had Puyo Puyo Fever

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Which we got as Puyo Puyo Pop Fever

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Um, that was on

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Uh, actually that was

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
The last game that was released for the Dreamcast

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
So we've had

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Versions on Xbox, Playstation 2

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
GBA, GameCube

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
DS, PSP

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Even Mac versions, Widow versions

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Pocket PC, Palm versions

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
DS, you know, all other

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Kinds of versions, so

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
It's been pretty cool

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I actually have the TurboGrafx version

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
At home

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Which my friend gave me

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
They made this game on every damn system basically

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Yeah, and you know there was actually

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
A music game sequel

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yeah, I remember, I think you showed it to me once

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Yeah, you showed it to me once

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Puyo Da

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I thought it was just you

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
It's a fun little game

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
With Puyo Da, it's like

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
You have to hit the buttons at the right time

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Sort of like, you know, Parappa-ish thing

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
But depending on how many you get right

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
You know, you get more points

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
And they get bombed

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So it's an interesting little spinoff

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Alright

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Well that's going to do it, is that it?

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I just had the line in there though

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
That I know that

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
It's not what she's saying

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
It's like the game psychic storm

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And you translate the line the same way as I get pissed off

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
My husband's crazy

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So it's the same

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Alright

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I believe that is going to do it

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
I hope he's listening because I picked this for him

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Puyo Puyo

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And apart from me because I love Puyo Puyo

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Puyo Puyo is like my favorite puzzle game ever

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
You do bring it up on the show quite often

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So I'm glad it's finally had a chance to be the game of the week

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I'll link this other one

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Because there's actually a Puyo Puyo anime

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
That was supposed to have been out too

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
And a lot of people do

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Really freaky cosplay from it

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And also I would say

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
If you want to get a recent version

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Of Puyo Puyo

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I got the Sonic Genesis collection

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Because it has Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Which granted isn't a pure

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Quote unquote version of Puyo Puyo

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But you get at least the gist of the game itself

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And you know it's part of that big collection

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So there you go

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
There it is your classic game of the week Puyo Puyo

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
We're going to take a quick break here on Orange Launch Radio

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
But we will be back with plenty more in part B

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
We're going to talk about other companies getting into used game businesses

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
That should be interesting

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Another game rental methods

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And some classic fighting games

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
For fighters in the wake of Street Fighter IV

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
We're going to be talking about some of that

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Coming up next here on Orange Launch Radio

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Stay tuned

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
On this Sunday evening

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
March the 8th of 2009

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Where we are taping live on AllGames.com

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
www.AllGames.com is the radio network that we are a part of

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Or if you want to check out our show specifically

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
You can check out www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
You really should though check out both

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
You know you get a lot of time to surf the internet

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I'm sure so you should check both sites out

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Because they're both great

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Alright we've been talking a lot about the latest and greatest in gaming

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
We're not done yet we've got plenty more

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Let's talk a little more business now Loki

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Yes let's talk business

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Toys R Us is actually going to try to get into the used game business

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
They're going to start doing trade-ins I guess

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Apparently an in-store advertisement

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Which was snapped by one of the cheap ass gamer forum members

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Actually showed that they're starting to do used game sales

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
In some select stores I guess like a trial period

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Apparently you'll be able to return your games for I guess Jeffrey bucks

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I'm sure it will be kind of similar to the gift certificate right?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Yes Jeffrey the giraffe dollars

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Which have no currency whatsoever in the real world

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
But yes you will be able to sell your used games back

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And receive store credit and no word on any pricing tiers

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Or whether they're going to be competitive or not

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000
But hey you know another option for trading in your used games is always welcome

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Although to be honest man the last time I went into the Toys R Us it was sad

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Like half the store was converted into a baby's R Us and that was really sad

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Well I don't know if that's what sells you know

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I remember those Toys R Us was the shit when I was a kid

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
It was amazing

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
It was so amazing

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
But you know now they have baby's R Us in there

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Well you know if it sells it sells right?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I just remember back in the day they used to have like the Atari 2600 thing set up

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
You could play the old school games on there

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
But it's cutting into my Lego aisle you know

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Well maybe that's because they have a Lego store at the mall you know

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Well fuck the- wait what mall?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Arden mall they have like a full Lego store now

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Are you shitting me?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I am not shitting you

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
That's so awesome

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
It's apparently like a chain of stores now

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Good! We need a Lego store

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
They can get rid of the Apple store anytime though

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
But Lego store is awesome

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I did not know you had such a fan boner for Legos

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I have 10 gallons of Legos

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I measure my Legos in volume now

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Oh my god

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Between her video game vault and your Legos like I feel like I need something

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
You know what I do have? I have a full dresser drawer

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Full dresser drawer full of PEZ dispensers

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I do have that

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I guess that's my thing I don't know

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
One of these days I'll take them all out and put them on display again

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
But it was getting to be a hassle

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
They'd always fall over

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
People would come over and knock them over to be funny

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Or they'd get punched over when somebody was drunk

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's messed up

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Do you have one of those PEZ dispensers that dispenses like the whole like rolls of PEZ?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
No I've seen those for sale though

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
I kind of quit PEZ collecting for a little while

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Something I did like in high school and for a little while after that

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
But you know what the nice thing is since I stopped for so long

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Now I have a lot of old PEZ dispensers that have just been sitting in a desk drawer

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Not getting any sunlight or anything

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
They're in good condition I'm sure

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
But it's not that I'm in the buying and selling business of PEZ dispensers

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000
You don't want to be one of those dudes on the food network during unwrapped or something

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Like I watched one last night and they were talking about some guy that collected Mr. Peanut stuff

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And he doesn't even like peanuts

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
He's just a douchebag that collects Mr. Peanut crap

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
It's like really? Okay

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Of course some might argue that I collect Hello Kitty stuff

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Because even like I'm making coffee right now

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Like for those listening live that heard me during the break in the middle there

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I'm brewing some coffee right now on my Hello Kitty coffee maker

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
With your Hello Kitty toaster that makes the Hello Kitty

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Hey it works, don't hate

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
It brews a damn fine cup of coffee

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And it was cheap, 20 bucks

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
So, whatever

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Anyway, I don't know how we got from video games to Hello Kitty

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But we can go back to talking about used games a little bit

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
You know what's interesting is that Toys R Us is kind of in cahoots with Amazon

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
So to kind of hear this

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
You know, because if you go to Amazon.com

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Their toy section is all Toys R Us

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Well Amazon.com is also running a trade-in program

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Which would make sense if Toys R Us is doing this

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Because they kind of have a little working agreement or whatever's going on

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
What you do, you can actually trade in games

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
You select games on their website apparently

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
They have to be in good condition

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
You send in a shipment or whatever

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
You print a shipping label on your computer

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And you can actually send these games in

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
And they will actually send you an Amazon.com gift card

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
For however much the games were worth

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Which is kind of interesting

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Now this is something apparently I think is just being tested right now

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I don't think it's actually starting just yet

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
But, yeah

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I don't know

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
No, I guess it is up and live now

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
There you go, you can actually check it out on Amazon.com

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I'm looking at the link right now

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And yeah, you can actually look up on their site

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Things you want to trade in

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And sell back to Amazon.com and you'll get a gift card

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Which, you know, considering that Amazon.com is much more than video games

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I think this is where it could prove to be an interesting competitor to GameStop

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Granted, GameStop, you can get cash for your games

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
You don't get a lot of cash

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
You get more if you go for the gift card

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
On Amazon.com, you can get

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Books, DVDs

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Heck, you can get appliances and stuff on the site

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
You can get airsoft guns

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
You can get a lot of stuff on Amazon.com

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
So it does open up this whole new door for that

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
You don't have to just trade in games for games

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Oh yeah, and they also sell books

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
AgDeftInChat, chat.orangelandraday.com says

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Rob sounds excited

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I don't know, I don't ever sell games back

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I probably should

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I have a lot

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I'm going to miss Drive Unlimited

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I realize I had it sitting on my shelf collecting dust

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I had no idea you even had it

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Well, that's great, I'll plug that in and try it this week or something

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
But yeah, I don't know

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
DarkTotemic in chat says

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Sky, really, the only thing GameStop has over these is

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
When you trade in a game, you can get a new one right away

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Amazon, you'll have to wait for shipping

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And that is a good counterpoint

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Because yeah, I don't like to wait for shipping and all this stuff

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I don't even like Netflix, because it's too slow

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
When I want to watch a movie, I want to watch it now

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
That's why I like Netflix Instant Queues, but let's face it, not everything is available on the Instant Queue

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
So, I don't know

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
DJ Rama S in chat says

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Now at GameStop, you get the same amount if it's cash or credit

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
That must be a new thing

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I don't know about that

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
It could be a promotion or something they're running right now

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
But it didn't used to be that way

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Yeah, it seems kind of fishy

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Because I'd be getting cash every time

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Why now, do you think that they're getting into this?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Do you think it's just the state of the economy?

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
There's more of a demand for used games

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Because $60 is a really high price point to get games

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I don't know

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Probably it's a big margin item

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It's a business that has a good margin on it

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Why not try to get into it?

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Amazon is a powerful name

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Online merchants

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000
If they can put together a really valuable system that people want to check out

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Because I remember reading the trade-in values for some of these games

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
And they were a few bucks higher than GameStop

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
But you've got to wait

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
A little bit longer

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
If you want to go that route

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I guess you could

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
If you're kind of patient

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I may look up some of my games to see if they're worth anything

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
If you're really patient

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Just put them on eBay

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Seriously

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Did you know Beautiful Katamari is a rare game now?

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
On Xbox 360

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
I guess they don't print it anymore

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
When you find it online

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
It's actually kind of pricey

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Kind of interesting

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Damn

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
That's what I heard earlier today

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
DarkSoccer, I would ask for your opinion on this whole thing

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
But then I kind of realized you have a museum in your house

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
You probably never sell back video games

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Do you?

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Sometimes we do, but we just sell back the newer crap

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Like sports games and shit

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I see

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Is this something that interests you at all?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Let's assume, hypothetically, your husband didn't manage

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Direct competition of this whole thing

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Do you think this Amazon.com thing is something that would be interesting?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I don't think so

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
We don't trade books at a video game store

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
We just take them back to his store

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
And trade them in for games at his store

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Right, but let's say hypothetically

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
He didn't have that

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Because not everybody has a husband that does that

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I just thought I'd ask

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Any more you want to add to this DarkSagra?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Good idea in theory

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I think Chegg.com started the trend actually

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
For doing it online

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
For having schoolbooks that you could rent

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And then trade in your old schoolbooks online

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
To them and then get credit

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
For stuff for your next

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Semester schoolbooks

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
It is interesting how the internet will do this sometimes

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Is that, you know, they might take an idea

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Like, for instance, Gamefly was essentially

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Kind of a rip-off of Netflix in a way

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
But it was, you know, for video games

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
So it's kind of interesting how you might take an idea

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
For one industry and kind of make it your own industry

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And then, you know

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
That's your new business

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
But I don't know, anyway

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Let's go on to the next story

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Well, in other news

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Speaking of GameStop

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
They've actually dropped

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
13%

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
In their stock value

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Ever since Amazon announced

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Their little trade-in deal

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
They actually

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Ended

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
The day

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
On Thursday trading in at $3.54

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Lower than it had before

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
So it looks like

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
That their investors are actually

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Getting kind of worried about

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Amazon's little plan

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Even though GameStop themselves aren't

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
And looking at this

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
It's a fairly significant

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Drop from what it was

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Interesting

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Another company

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Is actually trying something a little bit different

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
As far as games go

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Is actually Gamefly

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Now Gamefly is testing out this brand new kiosk

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Called the GBox

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
It's a game rental kiosk

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
It's gonna be

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
It's been spotted at Texas Tech University

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
They're probably gonna be launching

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
This

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Probably on a limited basis right now

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
To check it out

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
It will allow you to rent

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Games

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
For $2.49 a day

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
For, you know, Xbox 360

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And PS3

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And $1.99 a day for Wii

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And it's gonna have new titles

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And they're gonna carry them for, I guess, a short period of time

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And apparently

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Now no word yet

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
If this is gonna tie into

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Your Gamefly subscription

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Because that would be pretty cool

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
If you could actually have your

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Gamefly subscription

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And be able to say

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Take these back to a kiosk

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Instead of mailing them back in

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
That might be pretty cool

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
But I know definitely kiosk rentals

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And stuff like that are pretty popular

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
They've, you know, hell with Redbox

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
And stuff and almost all the McDonalds

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
And all the grocery stores out there

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
It's not surprising that they're

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Gonna do something like this

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
And actually I'm kind of interested in that

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Hopefully they do put that out

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Because $2.49 a night is not too bad actually

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
But if you compare it to

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Say $8 for 5 days

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I guess

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
It could become expensive

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
But if you just want a taste of a game

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
For like a day or something

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Might not be a bad idea

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I'm kind of dumb, the ones I see at Walmart

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And stuff with the, you know, DVDs

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
But I have Netflix, I have Instant Netflix

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
You know, I have other ways to access movies

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
But then I think about this whole concept for games

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And I'm kind of like, well, you know, if

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Walmart right by my house had a box like this

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I might be tempted to rent games

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Rather than just

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
You know, purchasing them

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
For like $60

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
But you can kind of already do that at Blockbuster

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And stuff, so I wonder what it is about these kiosks

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
That makes it so appealing

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I don't know why I rent a new movie from a kiosk

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Because you can get it at the same thing at Blockbuster

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
For the same price

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Or, you know, for a longer period of time

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Obviously, but you know, if you want to do it by night

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
It's all about convenience

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Because once, you know, if something like this takes off

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Then you're going to see a lot more of these people

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Doing it, and I bet you anything

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
If Gamefly has good success with this

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
You'll probably see Redbox doing it

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
They'll probably just have some sort of hybrid kiosk

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Where you can rent games and movies

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And trust me, companies like that

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Have thought about doing it

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And they've tested it in some markets

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
But the problem is, though, is

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
They're retarded, and they think that they can

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Make their money back on a game

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Charging 99 cents a night

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Well, that ain't the case, because games cost $60

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Where movies cost $20

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
So it's obviously not going to make sense for them

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
You try to tell to them, they don't understand

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Some comments from Chatroom, AcidicVampire

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Kind of said the same thing you did

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Redbox, the video game edition

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So, perhaps just a matter of time

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Blockbuster is still around, LOL

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
That's true, you know, these big box stores

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Are having a hard time kind of staying in business

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Because of just the competition they're getting from Netflix

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And so on and so on

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
You know, I don't know, I think Blockbuster has a really interesting

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Setup with the fact that they have

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Their Netflix slash, what do they call it?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Blockbuster Total Access or something

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It's like basically Netflix, okay

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
But it's Blockbuster stuff

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
And you can trade in the store

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So that way they get around the whole shipping thing

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
If you don't want to wait for shipping, you can trade in the store

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
It's cool, but the thing that Netflix has on them

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Is that Netflix has the streaming

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
And Blockbuster doesn't

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Like if Blockbuster teamed up with PS3 or something

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I would leave Netflix

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And go to Blockbuster

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
You know, that was one of the rumors floating around

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
My own

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
That would be pretty big

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
You know, Blockbusters and stuff like that

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
The kiosks are good if you know what you're looking for

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
But a lot of the times

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
If you don't know what you're looking for

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
The kiosks are not really good

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Because then you can't just browse stuff

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
I mean, they do have stuff

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
You can look at

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
But there's going to be a lot of people

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Waiting for the stupid kiosk

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
And you kind of feel pressured

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Let me ask a question to chat and everybody here

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Kind of a little bit of a deeper question about this

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
And everybody in the studio and those in chat too

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Is this type of announcement

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Really a good thing for the gaming industry

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Because if we're sitting here

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Loki and I talking about

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Maybe we'll stop making these $60 impulse buys

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
If we could just rent the game for $2.50

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Out of one of these kiosks

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
In the long run, is this going to be a good thing

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
For the gaming industry

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Or is this setting up the gaming industry to get shot in the foot

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
No, I think it is a good thing

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And the reason why is because if this kiosk

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Is going to be set up similar to say

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
A red box kiosk

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Not only can you rent stuff from them

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
You can buy stuff from them

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
And so, just because they put stuff in there

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
People might like it

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And they can purchase it from the kiosk

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
However though

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
On kind of the DVD movie side

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Not everyone is on board with the whole kiosk things

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
In fact, there's a deal going on right now

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
With Universal

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Where all their product is basically banned

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
From red box kiosks

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
They will not sell to red box

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And they will find anybody that sells to them

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
And basically ruin any sort of deals

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
That have gone on

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
So, red box

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
The people that run those

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Have to go out and actually purchase movies

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
From say a big box retailer

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
And then put them in their kiosk

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
But they can't purchase them directly

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
So they think that it's affecting their

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Sell through business

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
By having these red box kiosks

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Really when you look at the facts

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
That's not really the case

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
It's not really having a large impact on it

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
But that's the fear

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
But the thing is

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
With $60 games nowadays

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I think a lot more people are renting things

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
But there's still those other rental avenues

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
You know, you don't necessarily

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Need to use this kiosk

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And right now this kiosk thing is very limited

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Question from Robert M. in Chat

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
And I don't know if you know this because it involves Apple

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
But didn't Universal pull their videos from iTunes at one point?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I think they did because I soon remember like Heroes

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And the NBC shows

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
But I think that was more of an NBC thing

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
And NBC and Universal are in cahoots

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
So I think, I don't know if it's necessarily related to the red box thing

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
I think it was always a money thing

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Right?

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Other great comments from chat, thank you chatters

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Breslull, no

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
This was the same thing as Blockbuster renting games

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
And Nintendo got all pissy back in the late 80s, early 90s

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Acidic Vampire

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
It's a great thing because people will still buy the game

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
If they like it, especially gamers

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
DJ Rama S

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
This could force the gaming industry to lower the price of the PlayStation 3

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
360 games

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
ActDeft, sounds interesting but I really don't know if it'll work or not

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
XLink

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
It can be a pro because you can try to see if you want to buy the game

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Yeah, I mean I get that

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I see the pro for us

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I don't know if I see the pro for the developers

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
You know what I'm surprised hasn't happened yet

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
GameStop doing rentals

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Who knows

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Son of Dad

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
It might bring down game prices for retail as a whole

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I would buy a used game from a red box for 25 bucks

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
If it was available

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Superdude in chat says

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Wouldn't it be great if you could just stream new releases games

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Like you do with Netflix on Xbox Live

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
I bet you something like that is coming

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
There's those rumors going around that the PSP 2

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Or whatever they're going to call it

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
New PSP is going to not have a UMD slot

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I think we had a story on that a couple weeks ago

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Imagine if you could only download games

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I don't use my UMD slot

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Well

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
It's a little different for you

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
But you know what I'm saying

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
You kind of are seeing this shift towards digital distribution

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I think there was a lot of

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I seem to remember

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
We've been doing this show long enough now

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I seem to remember in the last generation

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
When it was new and all this stuff was new

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
When we first started our show

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
There was talk that this round of systems

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
We're in now

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Was going to be all digital distribution

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And certainly with things like Xbox Live Arcade

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
PlayStation Network

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
There's a gigantic foot in the door

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
But we haven't seen a complete shift to that yet

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
But the games on Xbox Live are getting bigger and bigger

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
You know they got rid of those limits on Xbox Live

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
That Watchmen game is what

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Like a gig or something

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I mean that's the size of a DVD

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
I don't know

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
You know

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I would think maybe something like that is coming

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Where you could stream games like that

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
But I don't think it's going to be

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
The retail games

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
It's going to be a long time before you see the retail games

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Buy into that

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
But certainly

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Digital distribution has games all its own

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Sony's on board with it

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
They're doing their first party games

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Available for PSP as digital downloads

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
At the same time as release

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
And they've kind of

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Tested the waters a little bit with Gran Turismo 5

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Prologue, Warhawk

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
You know, Burnout Paradise

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
If they can find a way that

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
People would be interested

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
In purchasing these games

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Heck a lot of Xbox Live Arcade games

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I could see that you know

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
They could have released them as a disc version

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
But they decided not to

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
And they just released it as an Xbox Live Arcade title

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And it's still done very well

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I'm not surprised

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Alright, we're going to move on to another story

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
But if you want to give your comments on this

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Mailbag at orangelauncherator.com

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Send us an email especially

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I really want to hear from

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
And I know we have a few that listen to this show

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I want to hear from the people that work for the developers and publishers

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
What do you think about these boxes?

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
What do you see as the impact to your business?

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I want to kind of hear from those guys

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
If you need to stay anonymous for whatever reason

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Then put it in your email

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
We'll be happy to stay anonymous

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I want to hear from that side of things

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Because I don't think we have anybody

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
In the chat tonight

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Maybe games that you might rant through these kiosks someday

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Arc System Works

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
They are the folks that put together Guilty Gear

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
They are doing a new high def 2D fighter

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
The game is called Blaze Blue

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I don't know how exactly you pronounce that

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
It's Blaze Blue I would imagine

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
It's coming out on the Xbox 360

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
And the Playstation 3

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Right now the game is out in Japanese arcades

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
It's coming out to home consoles over in Japan

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
And it's going to be coming out on the Xbox 360

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
And PS3 as well

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Apparently over the Japanese arcade release

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
In the console versions there will now be a story mode

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Some individual stories for each character

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
And so on

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
30 hours of gameplay according to the director Toshimichi Mori

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Also there's going to be

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Of course online support

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Which you can expect in this current generation of games

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
And download content as well

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Although they haven't said is that just going to be outfits

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
New characters, moves, backgrounds

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Whatever

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Kind of interesting especially if you're into

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Those Japanese fighting games

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I know there's a few sprinkled throughout the country

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Those Japanese style arcades where you can go play those machines

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I'm sure for fighting games

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Fans there's a few of this

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
But it's interesting now that you're starting to hear

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
A little bit about a resurgence of 2D fighters

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I wonder if Street Fighter 4 is to thank for any of that

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Although I imagine something like this

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Had to be in development

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
For a long long time

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Shadow Charlie in chat says

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Yeah I played Blaze Blue in Chinatown

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
What'd you think? I'm curious

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I had not heard of this game before tonight

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Seeing that news bit

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
They showed it off a while ago

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
It looks pretty sweet

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
It's all hand drawn

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
100,000 animations per character

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Nice

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Dan Shadow I agree with his comment in chat

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
When are we going to have a new Marvel vs Capcom

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
That's the one I'd like to see

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Or Capcom vs SNK

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Would be the one I'd really like to see

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
A few weeks ago on the show about how Street Fighter 4

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Feels a little bit like there's a slight SNK influence

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Like Crimson Viper

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Totally feels like she's lifted out of an SNK

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
But anyhow

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Go listen to a previous show

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
If you want to listen to that

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Other 2D fighter news Dark Sakura

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Well we have

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Actually it's funny you mentioned SNK

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
We actually have news

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
On King of Fighters 12

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
How long has it been out?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
12 years maybe

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Lucky guess

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Well it's actually the

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
First HD version

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
That's going to be on

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
From SNK Playmore

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
It's supposed to be on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
It has 20 playable characters

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And they're all

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Freshly redrawn

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
And the backgrounds are all new and pretty

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Supposed to really kick a bunch of ass

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
There's supposed to be preview footage

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And images

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Included with the PS2 release of

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Let us know if you see them

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
My's in it right?

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
That's all I want to know

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Well of course we already heard boobs

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Alright me bouncy

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
That's all I need

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Anyways

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
So

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Interesting

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Of course there's a lot of

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Piracy and flashcard developers

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
On

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
The DS and one of those would be

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
The Cyclo DS or

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
The CycloWiz which is the flash

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Not flashcard but the modchip I have on my Wii actually

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
They have developed

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
A new

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Program or update to their

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Program that bypasses

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
The anti-piracy

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Features in a lot of these games

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
And apparently now works on all the current games

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
That feature some sort of anti-piracy

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Lockout

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Yeah

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
There's no way to spin that

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
That's only for piracy

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
So I guess

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
If you're interested in pirating games

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
The Cyclo DS is the way to go

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
For now

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
But interesting though

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Is this something we should really be encouraging?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
No

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
But it's one of those things that you know

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
One reason I like to report on this on the show

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Is I know we all do is

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
It's out there

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
So you can't deny its existence

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
So it's kind of interesting to see what

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
That scene does to always compensate for what

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
The developers of the systems do and back and forth

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Yeah

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Alright

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Talking a little bit

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
About Metal Gear Online

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Kind of moving over a little bit

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
It's a new expansion coming out on St.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Patrick's Day March 17th

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
It's Metal Gear Online scene expansion

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Three brand new maps

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Coming to the game

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Two new characters are going to be coming as well

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Raiden and Vamp apparently are the new characters

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
That you're going to see in the Metal Gear Online

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Also some new special gear

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Which I think is kind of funny because now you can

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Apparently wear a bikini if you want

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Or you can dress yourself up in clown face or whatever

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Or you can wear the head of

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Robbie the Rabbit if you want to be extra creepy

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
That would be from Silent Hill

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So there you go

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Or if you just want to encourage people to shoot you I don't know

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Also there's going to be a brand new game type

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Of Metal Gear Online

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
It's free if you get the pack or not

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
It's solo capture

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
It's just like team capture

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
But you know you're by yourself

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Because it's solo capture

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
This expansion will cost you $9.99

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
If you want to get all the costumes and the characters

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
And all that stuff

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Yep there you go

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Pre-order start on the 10th

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
And there's some screenshots floating around the internet there

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Some other items

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
You can get a visor for Raiden

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Etc, etc

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I don't know anyone that plays Metal Gear Online

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
But I bet it has a pretty rabid community

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Because I can't think of many games like it

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
So there you go

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Alright let's move on with some more gaming news

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Well I would say this also doubles as pet news

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Well I would say this also doubles as pet news

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Um, Etsy

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Which is a site that has all kinds of sellers

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
That sell cute hand crafts

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
And clothes and stuff like that

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
There is um

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
A series of

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Cat toys

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Um, they look like controllers

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
They have one that's a um

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Guitar Hero controller

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
They have a Wiimote

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Um, a Gameboy

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
An old school Gameboy

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Like the brick

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
They have a 360 controller

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
And a uh

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
NES controller

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
And they look like they're made out of felt

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And they are for the kitties

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
They're so cute

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I was gonna say and above all

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
They're just cute

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Adorable for little kitties

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
I have to show this picture to the chat room

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Uh, might Shermie be getting one of these?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
No

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
She don't play with any of the shit I buy her

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
You know what she plays with?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
She plays with twist ties

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Nice

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
How about your kitty, Loki?

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I know you got a kitty a couple years ago

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Is this something that my cat would play with?

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
No, she'd probably look at it and go

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Does she still play with like that stick?

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Uh

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Oh, like the feather and stuff?

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Yeah, she loves the feather

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
No, her thing right now, what she's been doing

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Um, she likes it when we make her tents

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Or like little forts on the couch

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Like every time we go to bed now

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
We build her a fort

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Using the blankets on the couch

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
And she loves that

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
She's really easy to

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Um, entertain

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
She likes the milk rings

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
You know, the little rings on the uh, milk cartons

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Shermie likes those too

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Yeah, she has like 90 of them in the house

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
And there's like, she dumps them all in her food

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
And water for some reason, I'm not sure why

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
But

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I don't know

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
She's making tea, making plastic tea

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
I guess

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I always say Shermie puts her food in her water bowl

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Because she wants tea, or gravy

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I want a kitty, I don't have any cute kitty stories like you guys do

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I want a kitty

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
The roommate doesn't want a kitty though, so I'll have to wait

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
But, someday

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Oh well

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Um, now

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Not necessarily something for Kat

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
But um, the Playstation Network

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Um, Sony is I guess

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Trying to make this more like

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
The Virtual Console

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Now, the rumor is I guess that

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
They're going to try to

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Put more

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Non-PS1 titles on the

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Playstation Network

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
No word on exactly

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Um

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
What systems they're talking about

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
It's got to be arcade games

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
It's got to be, just through process of elimination

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
They can't put Nintendo games on there

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
It would be pointless then to put Sega games on there

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Now that they have that collection out

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Maybe they could strike a deal for TurboGrafx games

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Or something, but I'm thinking arcade games

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
You know, we have like Mortal Kombat 2 on Playstation Network

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Right? So, I'm thinking arcade games

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Yeah

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Um, yeah basically

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
They're promising more PS1 titles

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
And also more pre-PS1

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Retro titles

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
So I'm guessing those will be the arcade games

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
You can't really play

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Games like Mortal Kombat

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Over the PSP thing, right?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Because I remember Mortal Kombat 2 was one of the first games

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
That came out on Playstation Network, but you can play it on the PS3

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
But you can't play that on the PSP, can you?

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
It doesn't have that whole functionality, does it?

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
You can't play like multiplayer over

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Wi-Fi or anything like that

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
The emulator that it uses to run those

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Doesn't work that way

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Yeah, any Playstation 1 games

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
That are on the PS3

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Can be played on the PSP

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I don't know if Mortal Kombat 2 counts, though

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
I'm talking specifically that one

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
That might have been an Xbox

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Like a Playstation Network game

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
So that might not work

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
But if it's a PS1 classic title

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Then yes, that can be ported over

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
If I would get a memory card for my PSP

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
I could play sweet code on the go

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
But anyhow

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Going on to a completely different note here

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
This story has to do

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
With censorship

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Who doesn't love censorship, right?

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Although, I don't know if you could

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Directly say it's like censorship

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
But apparently, over in New Zealand

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
There's a guy

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
That wants to actually

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I guess

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Jail adults who allow their kids

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
To play video games that are violent

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Yeah, this is according to

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Chief Censor Bill Hastings

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
From New Zealand

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
You might think the offense is silly

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
But it ain't

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Apparently, if you were to, let's say, let your kid

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Play a violent video game

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Shoot him up, blow some hookers in Grand Theft Auto

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Whatever

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Apparently, if you were the parent

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
You let your kid play this game

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
You could face up to three months in prison

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Or a $10,000 fine

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
This law is set up to send a message

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
How about

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Just let people raise their children?

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
The way they want

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
To read something like that, I'm like

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
A big brother is watching you, how are they gonna catch you?

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Are they gonna be watching me in my house

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Or rely on people, tattling on other people?

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
This doesn't make sense at all

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Dan and I had a conversation about this earlier today, actually

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Really?

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
That we actually wouldn't mind if our kids play violent games

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
As long as, you know, we balanced it

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
And had, you know, talks to them

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
And everything

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
We're actually going to do it

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Intelligently

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
There's no way

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
You can just

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Shield and shelter them all the time

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Or else they don't grow up to be balanced

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Individuals

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
You know

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
GS68 in chat says

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Parents, not government, should be in charge of what their kids play

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
I think a very well-rounded statement

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Interesting though

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
So you would probably let your kids play

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Violent video games, I don't know

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
I'd probably play it with them

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Well no, I would play it with them

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
In the right context

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
I think it would be alright

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I'm trying to think about myself

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Maybe someday I'll have a kid somehow or whatever

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
But I don't know if

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Part of me says

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
If you don't let them play it

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
They're going to find a way to do it

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
And you're right, if you're not the one playing it with them

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Then they might not get it in the right context

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
If that makes sense

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Well on top of that, and this goes true for just about anybody

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Child, adult, whatever

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
The things that people are not allowed to do

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Tend to be the things

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
That they want to do just because they're not allowed to

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Do you know what I mean?

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Like for

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I'll use this as an example

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
There's a method of eating called the intuitive diet

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Where you don't

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Disallow yourself anything to eat

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Because that increases your craving for it

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Because you're fixated on finding everything but that

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
But meanwhile the thing that you want is fixated

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
But you can't have it

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
But you really want it

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
So when you do have it, you just go all out

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Well, you know, the same

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
The sort of logic

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Applies to just about anything that people are told they can't do

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Like, okay

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
For example

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Let's actually use the recent

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Prop 8 crap

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
People are told they can't do something, what happens?

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
People come out and force and protest it, right?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
And people

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
They get it done

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
While they can't or find other ways to get it done

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
That's what I'm saying is that

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
It's there, you know what I mean?

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Whenever someone says you can't do something

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
That's a very big part of human nature

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
That indignation that someone has

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
The audacity to tell you you can't do something

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
You know?

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Ever since we were little kids, don't you agree, Rob?

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Oh yeah, I mean, you know, and it's funny

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Because, you know, sometimes for laughs I'll go read

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
You know, specifically you're talking about Prop 8

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Which obviously is an issue I'm quite passionate about

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
If you don't know why, you know, you need to listen to the show more

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
But here's the thing

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Is that I'll sometimes follow it on one of the local news sites

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Where people can comment on it

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
A lot of comments I see are

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
They report on this issue too much

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
It seems like every day you're reporting on some protest

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
That's because people are not going to shut up

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
About this, ever

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
You take away people's rights

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
They're not going to be happy about it

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
We're not going to shut up

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Until it's equal

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
But my point was

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
I know, I'm sorry, I got on a tangent

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
But no, that actually has to go with what I was saying

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Is that you tell people they can't do something

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
And that's going to rise up indignation

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
You know, people

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Don't want to be controlled

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
People don't want to be told no

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
People, you know

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And the reason why I'm comparing

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Something as strong as a civil rights movement

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
To something as arbitrary as food

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
You know

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Is that it all comes from the same

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
The same sort of

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
You know, even if you may not consciously recognize it

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
It all comes from

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Someone's telling me no

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I don't want to be told no

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I can have this if I want to

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
It's a necessity

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
You know what I mean

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
And I think that's why

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
People have a problem with

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Bad language because we're taught

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
That it's bad and that we shouldn't say it

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
So what do you think

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
The first thing that people learn in other languages

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Is curse words

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Don't be gay Sparky, don't be gay

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Or

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
You know, why do you think little kids

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Think it's so awesome to go and sneak around

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
And do stuff behind their parents' back

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Because they know their parents are gonna make a big deal

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Out of it, it's part of its attention too

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Or, you know, why is it that people

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Get, you know

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Let's rate this very R, why do people get turned on

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Doing it in places that they know they're not supposed to

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Seriously

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Like the couple who was doing the

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Whoa

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
No, for real, there was a contest that was going around

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
About, you know, who could do it

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
In what area, and there were points you'd get

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
For touching

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Oh, wasn't that a big radio contest?

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
That was the thing that got them kicked off the air, right

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Where they had sex in a church or something

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Yeah, yeah, I remember that

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
But why would it be such a big deal if they weren't allowed

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Because you're not supposed to have sex in a house of God

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Exactly

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
When you're yelling, oh God, oh God, that's not praying

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
So, really

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Where would the allure be

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Of the kid sneaking around behind his parents' back

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
If there's no harm in it

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
If the parents are gonna be like

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Okay

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Do you see what my logic is?

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
No, I get it

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I'm gonna be like that with my kid

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
It's not that I'm gonna

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
I'm going to teach them the right and wrong

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
But video games are video games

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
My whole plan is to teach them the difference between

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Reality and unreality

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
And I also don't care if they curse

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Alright, obviously

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
This is soliciting a huge

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Response from chat

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I wanna read some of the chat comments we have here

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Game Guru says

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
I'll allow my kid to play any game

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
If it's rated for older people

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Superdude says no flower for my kids

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Can't play a game

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
As tame as flower

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
SSJ100Matt says

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Jamie will teach your kids to play pinball

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Hell fuck yeah

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
AcidicVampire says

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
And all the lyrics to Pinball Wizard

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
AcidicVampire says Jamie wants to play manhunt with her kids

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
No, I wanna play good games with my kids

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
GS68 says

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
If your kids can differentiate between reality and fantasy

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
At an early age, by all means, let them play

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Game Guru says

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Government is full of idiots

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
And I don't want idiots to raise kids

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
DeakMan

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Has an interesting plan in chat

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Live on Sunday night says

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
When my girl gets older

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
I plan on setting up an NES in her room

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
And only letting her play NES games for two months

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Then SNES for two months

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
And so on

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
So she gets an appreciation for classics

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Maybe

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Maybe I also have this expectation

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
That my child will be like me and my husband were

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
And not be stupid

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Because I've watched all kinds of crap

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
And played all kinds of crap

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
And as long as I

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
As long as the difference was

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I don't think a five year old should play Silent Hill

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Right

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
But what five year old is gonna be interested

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
In Silent Hill

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Right

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
But like, you know, when I was

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
For example, I don't look at it any different

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
As me being allowed to read

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
The books I was allowed to read as a child

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
You know

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
The Scarlet Letter had to do

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
With, you know

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
A woman conceiving an

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Illegitimate child by having an affair

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
How old were we when we read this?

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
You know

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
How about the Grapes of Wrath dealing with

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
You know, the depression

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
That's certainly an adult theme

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
I read Atlas Shrugged when I was in ninth grade

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
You know, that actually

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Deals with a lot of sex

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Catcher in the Rye is like the quintessential

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Sophomore year of high school book

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Right? I never read it

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
A lot of kids around here

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I read The Odyssey

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
When I was in middle school

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I read The Inferno when I was in middle school

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Alright

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
But I look at it

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
It's gotta be down to the parent's

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Judgment. I look at it the same way

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
And yeah, they're classic books

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Whatever people

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Situations dealt with are

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
For a different level

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Of intellect and maturity

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
And certainly, if I don't detect

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
The level of maturity that I think is gonna

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Be able to handle that

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Then, I'm, you know, I'm not

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Going to be the one to introduce it to them

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
You know what I mean?

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
If it comes out that, yeah

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I was at my friend's house and I saw

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
This thing, then I'll be like, okay

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Well, let's have a talk. You know, that's not real

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Right? Okay, don't do that

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Let's get some chat comments. This is a great discussion

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Breslull says, Jamie read Playboy

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Too. I don't know about that

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
For the articles, though, right?

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Bochikawa in chat says, Catcher in the Rye is like 6th grade now

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
They grow up so fast

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Dan Shadow says, you know with all these rainbows

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
And unicorns, 5 year olds will really be into

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Diablo 3

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Possibly

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Alright, some more serious comments in chat

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Deathwishing says, I personally think it's good

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
To show kids M-rated games

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Because it shows like Grand Theft Auto

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Because it shows them that if they do something wrong

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
They get fucked by the police

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I don't know about that

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
And what people are taking out of context

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
There was an XD after that

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
So I think there was a little tongue in cheek

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
But I also think that what some people are taking out of context

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Is that I'm not gonna take

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
A 5 year old, like I said

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
And play Silent Hill with them

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
It's a lot of it is parents

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Discretion

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
And, you know, like when

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
When my little sister, okay

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
My little sister was little, little

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
We played video games with her

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
You know, to those days it was

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Nintendo and Super Nintendo, but we sat down

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
And played with her

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
And, you know, she knew what was real

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
And what wasn't, like she knew that if she

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Sat on a sewer pipe, she likely wouldn't go into

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
A cavern with gold coins

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
You know

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
There's

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
There's a difference, you know, you just have to

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Trust sometimes that

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
The kids are smarter than you give them credit for

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
And I actually had this discussion

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
With Dan's stepmother

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
And I'm not gonna go into too detailed, but I was like

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
We can't expect the government to do

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
A parent's job for them

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
The parent's responsibility

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Is to that child until they are

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Of age and can leave

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
From

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
A person is a parent before

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Conception

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
That's how I see it

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
A couple last comments from chat here

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
And then we'll try to go ahead and move on for tonight

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
We're having a good discussion, and I'm sure we'll probably get some emails

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
About this one, can't wait

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Superdude in chat says, if kids can get their hands

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Into R-rated movies, it's not that hard

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
For them to get the M-rated games either

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Kids will always find a way to get the M-rated games

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Because they know M-rated games are the shit

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Deathwishing in chat

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Last comment here I'm gonna read

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
I play video games and I haven't killed anything except

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Ants, fucking ants

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
There you go

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Alright, if you want to join in

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
On our chat sometime

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Live here on a Sunday night

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
But for right now, obviously this oversensorship

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I have to agree with Marissa

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
What did she say?

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
When I was 12 I found my mom's

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
College level human sexuality book

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Only damage it did was give me some very happy

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Boyfriends later in life

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Alright

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Look, we gotta make some time here since

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
We did just read about a really ludicrous

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Story, obviously these types of stories

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Put us into a fit of rage

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
This is the part of the show that we like to call

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
The FUs of the Week

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
My first FU goes to people

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Making assumptions

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
This is

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Directed

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Towards certain people

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
In my house

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Who

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Will not

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Name names

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And also

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
I'd actually have to direct that towards

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Myself too because I've made a couple of

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Assumptions too

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
My second

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
I was about to say my second assumption

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
My second FU

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Actually has to do

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
With semis trying to do

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
U-turns and intersections

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Too small for them

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
And my third one

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Has to do with

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
The Watchmen movie

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
It should have been a fucking miniseries, not a movie

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
That means I didn't like it

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
I just meant the story

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Would have been better told through a miniseries

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
You just wanted more of it

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I wanted it better paced

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I'll put it that way

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
It needed better pacing

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Alright, I don't really have a lot of FUs

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I guess FU to Daylight Savings Time

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Does that really screw it up my weekend

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Otherwise, just an FU to the fact

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
That I'm flying to Washington DC this

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Week and I'm only going to be there for a day

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
I'm flying there on Tuesday

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
I'm going to be there Wednesday, I'm flying back on Thursday

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
So FU to not getting to spend quality time

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
In a far away town

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
FU to Couple Stones because they suck to walk on

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
They're round and awkward

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Round and awkward

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Fair enough

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
That's going to do it for the FUs of the Week

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Segment we've done for the past

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Many, many years here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Let's get back into some gaming news

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
We do have the mailbag coming up and the Skype line

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Soon enough as well where we'll be taking your calls

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
1877 Game OLR

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
But not just yet, we'll let you know when the phones are open

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
We do still have some more stories we want to get to before then

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Right, Jamie?

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Yes, and this one's about Penny Arcade

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Washington State has passed a bill

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Which is pretty much like Damn You Guys Rock

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
To the Penny Arcade founders

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Jerry Hulkins and Mike Krahulik

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Is that how it's pronounced?

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
But basically they were honored for their contribution

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
To their state's industry

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Because there are about

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
48 video game companies

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
In Washington

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
And also they run

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
A really, really excellent

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Charity, the Child's Play

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Which has raised over 4.5 million dollars

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
For children's hospitals

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
So very good

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
And they also bring people to the state

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Like Penny Arcade Expo does

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Yeah, and just obviously

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Yeah, Penny Arcade Expo is probably a huge

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Economy boost for the state

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Especially for the restaurants

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
And the bars

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
They're very happy about that

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Well, you may remember me talking about

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Eat, Lead, The Return of Matt Hazard

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
A game that came out

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
A couple weeks ago, actually last week

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
And kind of

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Was a parody on the old

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Video game genre

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Everything from old

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Shareware games

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
You know, RPGs and that kind of stuff

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Well now, they have a

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
New Flash game that you can try out

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
That actually recreates one of these

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Fictional games in

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
The history of Matt Hazard

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
And the game of course

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Is Matt Hazard

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
In Land Extreme

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Alpha Advance

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
And it's a

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Game you can check out at

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
MattHazardExtreme.com

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Kind of a parody of a 16-bit

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Game

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
And they have a nice photo of Matt Hazard

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Destroying what looks like a robotic

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Pegasus

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Huh

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
You know, Dan Shadow in chat says

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Matt Hazard is not good, quite simply

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Um

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Were you a fan of Eat, Lead, eventually?

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
I know a couple weeks ago we were playing it

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
It was okay, it wasn't great

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
The game itself is funny, but the way it

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Plays is kinda crap

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
So it's just, it's not

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I don't know, it was like

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
A good idea on paper and then they tried to

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Make it and it just wasn't working

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
It didn't work

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Well, one game that's worked for some people, I know this game

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Has their fans, I'm gonna be honest, I've never played this game

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
But Eve Online does have a very

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Rabid fan base, I know we have a couple callers that play this game

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Um, online, hey guess what?

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
There is an expansion coming out, I'm sure the fans

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Of the game must know this, it's Eve Online

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
And I'm probably gonna butcher the name

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Of this, but it's Apokripa

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Apokripa? I don't know how exactly

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
You say that, Apokripa

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Apokripa, I don't know how you say that

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
But that is the expansion that's

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Coming out this week, and apparently

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
It's gonna kinda change some things about the game

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
If you're a new player in the game

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
You get some new epic mission arcs that are

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Gonna help guide you through the different factions

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
In the Eve Online game, and so this means it's gonna be

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
A little more new player friendly, probably to

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Address some of those things that Eve Online is too damn

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Difficult, or I've heard a lot of people have gotten into

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
This game and they get blown away because I guess the whole thing

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Is PVP, so this will kinda help

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
But if you're a veteran player and you wanna get into

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
This game, there will be some new wormholes

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
That are gonna show up in the game

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
And you'll get some new enemies and some new items

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
And things of that nature

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
The enemies will now change their tactics

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Based on your performance

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
They might even call in backup, change

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Some targets, use debuffs

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Whatever they're gonna have to do to

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Blow you up

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
So check out that Eve Online expansion

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
For Apokripa

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
A-P-O-C-R-Y-P-H-A

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Apokripa

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Apokripa, that sounds right, Apokripa

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
There you go

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Uh, Eve Online coming out soon

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Coming up right now, the Orange Lounge Radio

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
If there is one this week

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
That would just be Harvey, who is invisible

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Or Pikachu, if you're watching Justin TV

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
We do have Pikachu and he's armed with a sword tonight

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Which Loki's kind of sitting in front of us

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
He can't really see, but he does have a sword

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
That's Pimp and Pikachu

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
That's right, with his pimp hat tonight

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
The other week you were talking about British tele

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
It wasn't worth watching on the BBC

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
If you can access the BBC iPlayer

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Please, please, please make some time to watch

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
A phenomenal new series called Being Human

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
It's about a vampire, werewolf, and a ghost

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
That share a house in Bristol

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
It really is the best thing on TV at the moment

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
It was Master Chef

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
But that's finished now

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
I would love to know your thoughts

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
I feel like I should inject something

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Game related here, so here's my gaming week

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Slash month

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
COD World at War on the Wii

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Tony the Tiger says it's great

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Not sure if Tony the Tiger owns a Wii though

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
I'm going now, bye, love from Chard

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Age 23 and a half

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
No wait, I'm nearly 33, fuck

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Where did that come from?

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
That is what the email said, by the way

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Which was beautiful

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Wow, the next one's big

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Thank you spazzinator

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Hi folks, if you three didn't mind

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I have a few questions for you

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
First of all, as of right now

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
I'm trying to change up

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
How my 360 Elite is hooked up to my TV

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Mainly for convenience sake

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
More than anything

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
However, I'm running into issues

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Right now it's hooked up to my 32 inch

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
1080i HD TV via component cables

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
That like to be hooked up by HDMI

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
And passing through an HDMI switch

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
On its way to my TV

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
As nearly as I can tell, it should be a no brainer

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
All this

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
All this seating seems correct

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
And it's just a matter of swapping cables

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
However, every time I do attempt to switch my TV

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
It tells me it's receiving an invalid signal

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
I read the 360's instructions

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
And it seems like I'm doing everything right

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Am I overlooking something obvious here

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Before you say it, I know I won't see an improvement

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
In picture, I'd just like to

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Like the convenience of using my

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
HDMI switch to switch

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Between my cable box PS3 and PS3

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Um, you said PS3 twice

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Anyone care to tackle that?

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I ran out for just a minute

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
That was the heart of the question

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Because I wanted to get a refill on my coffee

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Something about not getting the right picture?

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
He wants to hook up his Xbox 360

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Elite through the HDMI switch

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
But it's getting an invalid signal

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Um

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Hmm

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
I'm not sure, this might be a question

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Better left for a Best Buy employee

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Do you have any thoughts, Loki?

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I'm not sure, it's okay

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
You should just hook it up and it should work

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Yeah, it should just kind of work

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
It should be via component cables

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
But I want it to be hooked up by HDMI

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
But it should be a no brainer

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Yeah, it should be a no brainer

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Every time I do attempt it, my switch TV says I'm getting an invalid signal

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Try new cables

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Yeah, it's gotta be the switch, the cable

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Something weird's going on there

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
You're right, it should be a no brainer

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
It ought to just work

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Should just be able to plug it in and go

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Um, some thoughts from our chat room

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Because of course when we can't think of the answer

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Usually our chatters can

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Because Microsoft wants you to buy a new cable

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
AcidicVampire says you might have to use a

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Microsoft HDMI cable

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Nah, it doesn't matter, it's just an HDMI cable

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
But it sounds like, I don't know, some issue

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
If you've got cheap cables though

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Then that might be the problem

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
We actually pretty much use them

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
I think we pretty much stick with the monster cables at my house

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Monsters, crap

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
But just any HDMI cable

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Maybe that one doesn't

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I don't know if you've used that HDMI cable on anything else

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Maybe I've had issues

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
It might be just poor shielded or something

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
For some reason it's getting the wrong signal

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
To it

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
There's another thing you can do

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Maybe with it hooked up

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Where you can reset the

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Your video settings

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
On it and you might try that

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Maybe booting up with the HDMI cable

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
I think you hold

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I want to say it's either the right shoulder button

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Or the right trigger and why

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
While you're booting up the system

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I'm sure if you look on Game Facts or something like that

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
One of them will reset the video

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
The other will format your hard drive

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
No, one will not format your hard drive

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
That's something different

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
That's a reset

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
There's another one to reset your cache also

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Yeah, I think it's

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
The shoulder button or the right trigger

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
It's one of those and why

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Oh, is the little thing on the

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Oh no, it doesn't, nevermind

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
I'm thinking the little switch on the back of the core

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
And it's also important that you have to turn on your console

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
With your controller if you do that

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
But

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
I don't know why that would affect anything

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
But maybe you could try that and see if that works

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Other thoughts from our chat

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Again, thank you guys very much

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
SSJ100Matt suggested he update it

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Because they just updated the HDMI on Xbox Live

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
AcidicVampire says

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
I tried a generic cable and it didn't work

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
But it works on my Playstation 3

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Dan Shadow says don't buy monsters

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
SSJ100Matt says I got an HDMI cable

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
For less than a dollar and it works great

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Tony Tony Tony suggests

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
HDMI input

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Cablewholesale.com, that's a good place

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
To check for cables on HDMI

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
I think this might be the best advice yet

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
TigerClaw suggests maybe it's a handshake issue

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
The HDMI switch must support

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
HDCP

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
So maybe the switch is not

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Good enough, that's a good thought

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
And then lastly

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Another thing to test, SSJ100Matt says

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Try plugging the HDMI cable directly into the TV

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
And then a recruit

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Who has not changed their name

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
They need to make sure their 360 is configured correctly

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
So wow, that's like a million different options

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Hope it works out for you buddy

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Let us know what happens

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Next part

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
In regards to last week's story about the lesbian

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
That got banned from Xbox Live after reporting being

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Harassed by others

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
I have a bit of an odd nagging question which honestly

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I'm surprised no one else has asked

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Not to suggest in any way shape or form

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
That Microsoft or the bullies were right

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
They obviously weren't by a long shot

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
But what exactly is the point of

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
One's orientation on one's online profile

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
On either Xbox Live or PSN

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Granted, I'm still fairly

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
New to the whole Xbox Live scene and all

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
But as nearly as I can tell the bio section

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Of Xbox Live profile is geared

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
To inputting info about yourself

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
That's gaming or gamer lifestyle related

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Such as what systems you

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Own, what game genre

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Players

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
How long one has been gaming, etc

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
I don't see how one's orientation

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Regardless of what it is has anything to do with gaming

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
True

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
As I stated on the show last year

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
The one where there was a talk about the so called offensive

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Retooling of space invaders for the art

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
commentary purposes

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
I'm all for the first amendment rights

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Regardless of whether or not others are offended

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
But somehow talk of one's orientation

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
On Xbox Live seems a bit out of place

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Although it's not perfect

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
The only analogy that comes to mind

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
At the moment would be like

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Going to an AA meeting and talking about all things

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
With the analogy AA meetings are for dealing

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
With alcoholic issues not TMNT

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
And as nearly as I figure

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Bios on Xbox Live profile are meant to be gaming

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Related

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Am I missing something here? Am I way

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Off the mark or missing the point here?

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
I do hope that she

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Gets her profile back and that she's not turned off

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
From online gaming

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Frankly even though there are A holes

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Online gaming on Xbox Live or PSN

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Can be a lot of fun

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
I kind of get what

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
It's Spaz who sent the emailer

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
I kind of get what Spaz is saying here

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
About the whole like you know why did she

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Even need to say it in the first place and you know

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I don't get it, you don't get it

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I don't think any of us really understand why she has to

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Say it but at the same time

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
If that's what she wants to do

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
If that's what she wants to put in her profile

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Shouldn't she be able to put it?

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
I mean it's not like she put I like to stab kittens in the face

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
She's a lesbian

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
I wonder though if

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
I love the stab kittens in the face would be

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Considered offensive and if that would get banned

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
You probably would I wouldn't try it

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I mean if that's what she really

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Wants to put in her profile

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Who am I to judge?

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Maybe I should create a profile a silver account

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Or something like that that says I love the stab kittens

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
In the face

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
My profile on Xbox Live says I host a radio show

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
On the internet called Orange Lounge Radio.com

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Oh my god banned

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Do you think half the people that punch me in the face

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
In Street Fighter 4 and just kill me

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
To the ground do you think they give a shit?

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
That I'm another person with a podcast on the internet

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
How many people actually read their profiles?

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Welcome to the Fantasy Zone get ready

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
And do you think

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
99% of the people that you run into

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
On Xbox Live know what the fuck that is?

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Only the old school gamers

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Exactly

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
You know what it's from

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I know what it's from it's from Space Harrier

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Not Fantasy Zone common misconception but still

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
You know what I mean

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Oh completely off topic I actually found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Congrats

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
You're a winner

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
I am

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Ponzi scheme in chat says

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I listened to the interview on Major Nelson's podcast

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Microsoft is being ultra PC with this issue

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Of course

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Of course they have to be ultra PC with this issue

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
They don't want to get the pink mafia

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Sicked on them which I completely understand

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
And obviously

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
I think they realize this situation

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Has been blown completely out of

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Proportion thank you internet

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
But it's something that needs to be addressed

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
So it'll be interesting to see what happens

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
As a result

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Alright ready?

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Next email

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
I'm sorry I have to say this one other comment from Ponzi scheme in chat

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
I like Olive Garden's never ending pasta

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Will I get banned for that?

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
No but you might get fat

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Or diarrhea

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Hey OLR crew

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
I've listened to your show for the past 3 years or so

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
And I thought it would be nice to give you some thanks

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Thank you for helping me get through my customer service job

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
For entertaining me on long bus rides

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
And for keeping me sane

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Your podcast was the first one I ever listened to

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
And it's one that I look forward to listening to

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Every week

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
There's another reason why I'm sending this email

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
You see I am sick and tired of people sending emails

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
With crappy punctuation, grammar, and spelling

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Laziness is no excuse

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I thought it would be nice for Dark Sakura to finally get

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
A well written nearly error free email for once

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
In addition

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Just for the sake of proof of concept

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
This email is written from my iPod touch with auto correct

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Turned off so you see people

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
It can be done

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
I love you

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Alright I'm stepping off my soapbox

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Maybe one day I'll email you with something video game related

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
But that will have to wait for another day

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Midnight skies

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
This presentation of Grammar Nazi has concluded

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
We now return you to your Orange Jones radio already in progress

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Actually I've found no errors

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Congratulations

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
What do you want a cookie?

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Fanfare

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Oh god don't make me dig up the soundboard

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Oh well you were already doing it

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Thank you

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Thank you thank you thank you

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Midnight skies

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
And I think it was Sasa that pointed this out to me before

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
But I tend to read the emails like they're sent to me

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Including you know bad grammar run on sentences and all

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.000
So you can tell from the fluid way in which this email was read

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.000
That it was properly phrased and properly punctuated

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
That it didn't make my heart hurt

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Okay what's the email on his name Midnight Skies

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Midnight Skies

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Congratulations

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
You get a cookie

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.000
This email is getting saved never delete it or I'll stab a kitten in the face

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Alright any more emails

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Next

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
This is an inquiry email

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Via orangejonesradio.com

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:09.000
From oh dude we have that cool thing set up don't we

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
What?

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
I guess this is through the website

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Oh no this is me just going

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Okay

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
It's from Irene

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Let's just do the rest of the radio show

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
That was my tribute to Irene the fart princess

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Hey there OLR crew this be Lexo and Yo

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Or Leoxon Lao Shen

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000
I think it's Leo Shen that's what I've always said

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
First of all

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:39.000
First off I'd like to say that OLR has got to be my favorite video game show of all time

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
That aside

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Recently on your show I've heard the constant complaint that industry fighter force Seth

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
The final boss is a cheap bitch

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I'd like to show you all a fighting game boss that is even worse than Seth

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Someone with the definition of a cheap bitch in fighting games who has the dreaded SNK boss syndrome times 10

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Okay so I need to take a look at this

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Oh fuck

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:09.000
I'd like to mention that the boss in Tatsunoko vs Capcom is also a cheap bitch

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Yes

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
We are looking at a video here in studio of a fight from Arcana Heart 2

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
That's brand new

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
And I'm trying to, the video is buffering

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
It's all chick fighting

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Well that's not anything new

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Alright

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Alright so yes I'm looking at this boss fight

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Yes we're watching

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
It's pretty

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
I mean I can't falter for that

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
She's way too covered though

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
At least the one on the left is

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
So the video is a little bit of a low quality

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
That's what I was saying, the one on the right

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Alright anyway I'm sorry

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Exactly that's what I'm saying

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
That's her bouncy

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Alright sorry what's the rest of the email

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:53.000
I'm actually just watching the, oh my god, cheap bitch much

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Damn

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Okay so

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:01.000
They have a special pink controller that you can get for this

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Who cares I want it

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
I want this game

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
I think I'm gonna have to get this game

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Alright

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.000
So anyway, back to the email that was currently in progress

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:17.000
She happens to come from the all girl fighter called Sugoi Arcana Heart 2

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Sugoi means wow

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Her name is

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
I think that's what Loki said when he saw those boobies

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Her name is Paraslycia

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.000
And she just happens to be an elven woman who can summon four elemental spheres to take you down

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
What makes her so bad you may ask

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Well first off she has an auto regen super meter

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Some special attacks that when they connect it spells an instant 70% or more off your health depleted

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Has a special where she can restore most of her health and you can't really stop her from doing it all too well

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.000
And she has a nasty little instant kill ultra move as demonstrated over and over in the video included

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:56.000
She also has a bit jiggle of her breasts when she unleashes her special moves

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Although to some people that wouldn't hurt to see when their ass is handed to them

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
We did notice that emailer

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.000
She can be beaten but you need some mad skills to do so

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
The video shows her on normal mode

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:12.000
I can honestly say that she's just as bad on easier modes

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Imagine if Seth was like that OLR

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:20.000
I bet some people would have stopped playing Street Fighter 4 arcade mode altogether if Seth was that tough

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Well you know I do have to mention that Seth is sort of like you know wearing just like a thong type thing

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.000
I would be fine if she was just wearing just a thong

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Let her finish

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Well just wanted to show a boss that would make Seth her bitch

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Keep up the great work with the show but Seth does gut suck

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.000
You're fighting game addicted listener Leoshen

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000
P.S. this message is brought to you by Sugoi Arcana Hearts 2

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
It's so good you'll slap your mama

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:51.000
And of course I love you mama peace out OLR

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
That was a pretty funny email

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Every other sequel that comes out we should all say Sugoi in front of it

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Like wow

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Hey guys

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Oh sorry I was on the next email

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Dan Shadow in chat says well who doesn't have a jiggle in their breast when unleashing their special

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I can't be the only one without problem

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.000
I think that the next email is from Dan Shadow

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Oh well then let's hear it

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Hey guys Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is one of my most cherished games

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:24.000
After school my friends and I would go to the local pizza place and just rock that arcade

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Every day I hope that a new one will be made

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:32.000
To get to the point what new Marvel fighters do you think should make it into a new game if one was made today

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Which characters deserve to get scrapped

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
I personally hope Dante from Devil May Cry

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000
The Bionic Commando and Bucky as Captain America would be in it

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Keep it real guys the cold stone is delicious

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I want Deadpool

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I want Deadpool in the Dan fighting game

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
And he has to

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Could you imagine Deadpool vs. Dan

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:57.000
That would be funny as fuck because it would be taunting back and forth the whole time

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Except Deadpool would pull out a gun

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
I don't have the comic book knowledge to really answer that question from the Marvel standpoint

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.000
But from the Capcom standpoint I agree with the Bionic Commando guy with the arm

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
That would be pretty hilarious

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:09.000
That's a good suggestion

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
He was a helper in the first Marvel vs. Capcom

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.000
This is who I would see in my dream

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
From Capcom characters

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:19.000
I would actually totally believe Strider Hiryu in it

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.000
But I would actually have a palette swap for Hien

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
From Strider 2

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Also you should totally have

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.000
For playable I agree with the new Captain America

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
I agree we should have

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Well I would totally say put Luke Cage in it

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
How about Arthur from Ghouls and Ghosts

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.000
He was a helper and I honestly don't see him doing the fighting type

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Unless maybe if he was on a second bard he fought in his underwear

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I was just going to say when he gets down to low life his suit gets knocked off

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Or he has the gold armor during a power up

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.000
I don't know I'm stupid

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
I want Forte

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Or

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Bass

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Rob from Rockman

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Um

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
I also

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000
I'd actually like to see Ingrid

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
And I definitely want Sakura in the game

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
But um

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
I don't know

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
You could really there's just so much to choose from

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Alright enough fanboy wank

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000
That's it

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Alright

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Wank wank wank

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Speaking of wank I'm sorry that was wang

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Today

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Oh and the Watchmen movie

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Yeah I've heard I've heard

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Big blue cock

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
I think it's all CGI though

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Actually I will go ahead and tell everybody this who's going to see the movie

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Unless you're like looking at his crotch

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
The cock is not distracting

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Unless you're looking for it

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Cock is always distracting I don't know dark Sakura

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000
It glowed with the rest of him so it was kind of hard to see

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Alright I'm waiting to see the movie on IMAX

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
So I can have you know a six story tall cock

02:25:58.000 --> 02:25:59.000
That would be

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Is that like Disneyland?

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
It's an IMAX at Eldorado Hills

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Is it really?

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I know they had IMAX out there

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Yeah I know they just added it but um

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Yeah it's playing there

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Alright

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
The Irish gangster in chat says

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
In Soviet Russia cock looks at you

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Do you want six story cock?

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Uh sure

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Do you want to be blue and radioactive?

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Yes please

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Okay

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Alright let's

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Let's get one more story and then we're going to open up the skype line to your calls

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.000
At 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Yeah

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:37.000
So let's see there's some possible announcements that are going to happen

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Later this week actually

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Supposedly on March 12th

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Kind of going along with their whole launch event for Resident Evil 5 in San Francisco

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:54.000
There is some evidence suggesting that they're going to announce a brand new Resident Evil title for the Wii

02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:00.000
And that Resident Evil title just might be a port or remake of Resident Evil Code Veronica

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:07.000
And apparently there's been a lot of rumors going around saying you know

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Hey if you're a Resident Evil Wii fan we've got some great news for you

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:20.000
And I don't know I mean honestly I didn't think Code Veronica was that great

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.000
From what I remember reading as far as reviews go and stuff

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:31.000
I don't know Code Veronica did come out though on the GameCube back in 2003

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:37.000
So maybe they're doing a Resident Evil 4 Wii version type thing for this

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000
I don't know maybe just adding the Wii controls to it

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.000
I don't think that would be that exciting if that's what they're doing

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
But maybe a brand new Code Veronica game who knows

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
But maybe a brand new Resident Evil game for the Wii

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Anything I guess is pretty good

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.000
AcidicVampire wonders aloud in our chat room why Veronica why not Resident Evil 2

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I don't know

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Maybe because you know not that many people had a Dreamcast

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.000
But compared to the Wii not that many people had a Dreamcast

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:14.000
And the Rob D in chat says the reviews for the Code Veronica were all pretty good on the Dreamcast

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Alright hey if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
We are going to open up the phone lines right now to take your calls

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Do we have any last minute stories while we're waiting?

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.000
I think we hit out almost everything that was in the show roll thread this week

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.000
But I don't know Loki did anything come up last minute tonight or Dark Soccer?

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Cock

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000
I waited for you to take a sip I timed it wrong

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Yeah I had coffee

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:44.000
I ran in during that last story because I drank two cups of coffee so you know why I had to run in the house

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Drop head to tinkle

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Yes

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:56.000
I guess like a small thing I guess some of the cars from Burnout are going to be in Godfather 2

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Interesting

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
That doesn't make any sense to me but okay

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Alright we got a call on the line

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this?

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Breslau how you guys doing?

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Breslau damn we haven't heard from you in the show in a long time

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000
You know in chat you never shut up but it's nice to hear your actual voice how have you been?

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
I don't know what you're talking about

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
How have you been sir?

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:21.000
I have been well except for my Xbox Red Ringing which is the complete stem of that little rant I wrote on our news page

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:28.000
But before it Red Ringed a mini review of a game that's been out for a while

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000
The Sega Sonic Genesis Mega Collection

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Yes

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:35.000
I don't know if you guys have talked about this

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:40.000
We have we lavished fanboy wank upon it a few weeks ago that's my tip of the evening fanboy wank

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:46.000
It's probably the best bang for your buck on the Xbox right now it's almost 50 games for 30 bucks

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:52.000
And you can get a lot of play out of it you get two shining forces four fantasy stars all the Sonics

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I mean there's at least 80 hours of gameplay in there

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:05.000
What I didn't really like is you can change the video settings but it's only within each game there's not a global setting

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
That gets kind of annoying

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:15.000
The games also just like everything else that's happened with you know old ports they don't look good in 720p

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:20.000
No they don't and you know what though I agree maybe a global setting would be nice

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:23.000
But you know the game does remember from game to game how you have it set

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:28.000
So some games look better like with that stretched you know faux 16x9 than others

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Other games were not meant to be played in that stretched 16x9

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:35.000
But games like Sonic Spinball actually work really well in the stretched 16x9

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Absolutely I agree with that I mean a lot of those Sonic games look good in 16x9

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:44.000
You know the smoothing feature is probably one of the worst things I've seen

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:48.000
But there's two games that actually look good with them and there's Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:52.000
But overall it's 30 bucks go get it

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Yeah it's not bad I actually reviewed it on Playstation 3 because when I went to get it they didn't have it on 360

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:01.000
So I just said what the hell it's the same game so I got it on Playstation 3 but you know same same

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
And it's a great collection

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Yeah absolutely and if any of you haven't heard I have to plug the other thing I do besides the USO March Madness

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Which the Final Four has been announced blah blah blah

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
You want to tell us what the Final Four is real quick?

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Sure why not the Final Four as of right now are Super Mario Bros. 3 vs. Rock Band

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:30.000
And I know at least one person on the air right now voted Rock Band very protest like

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Yes but that was me just because I wanted revenge on Tetris for it beating Super Metroid

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:40.000
But I still believe Rock Band has no business being in the top four games of all time

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Mario 3 I can see that I can see that

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Well that comes from you know this show's roots as a music game show

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Sure I understand that I understand that it's not please I spent like most of my gaming week playing Rock Band

02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:01.000
It's not that I dislike Rock Band by any means but it's no Mario 3 it's no Super Metroid

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
It's no Final Four game and it's no one seed

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Maybe in a couple years it needs to age like a wine a little bit

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Yeah and then the battle of the Super Nintendo games on the other side of the bracket is Chrono Trigger vs. Link to the Past

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Link to the Past almost got beat by Sonic 2 which has been the dark horse of the entire tournament

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Yeah it's been very interesting I don't know how Sonic 2 has been doing

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Who are the Sonic fans that are voting that game up? Nobody's really professed

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:28.000
I did it a couple rounds but not against Link to the Past not against that

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I didn't do it against Ocarina of Time

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I still have a hard time accepting that Chrono Trigger beat Final Fantasy 6

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:41.000
But that's my own because I love Final Fantasy 6 but I understand there is so much fanboy wank

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:45.000
For lack of a better term out there for Chrono Trigger especially with the recent release

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:50.000
I can see that but I'm a little disappointed that Final Fantasy 6 didn't pull through

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:56.000
But I guess if it's going to be beat at least it didn't get beat by like DDR or something

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:59.000
If Final Fantasy 6 is going to get beaten by a game at least it was Chrono Trigger

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
At least I can say okay I understand that

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Yeah and it's the same thing along Mario 3 beating DDR finally

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:14.000
But also if you haven't heard and you are in the Pacific Northwest area

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
The convention that I staff at Sakura Con is going to have Smile DK there

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000
It's their second North American appearance ever

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:27.000
So it's in a month so I think preregistration closes next Sunday

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:32.000
And I think it's $45 for all three days so if you want to go and meet Smile DK

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:37.000
And also we're going to be doing under sedation live on location so

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Is Travis going out there for that?

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Travis is not but we have an internet connection and there's sure to be a lot of fun involved with that

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.000
You know what if the Southwest prices stay low I might just have to consider it

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Because my friend can get me a really good discount on rooms and stuff

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:56.000
I might have to consider it press lol

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Because especially if you can get us an interview with Smile DK I might really have to do it

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Oh dude absolutely

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Interesting I don't know I can't speak for the other two but I will always take an excuse to go to Seattle

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Absolutely I took an excuse to move here

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:16.000
I don't know but at the same time I've also been promising Chicago for years and years

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:20.000
And I kind of feel like an obligation that if I'm going to do one I kind of need to make ASEN happen

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
But we'll see

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Alrighty well that's it really from here in Seattle so nice hearing from you guys again

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Alright thank you as well Bresl and keep writing those articles for the website

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Good time

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
And by the way

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:39.000
He hung up on us little bastard

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:45.000
By the way speaking of articles on the website while we're waiting for another call

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.000
At 1877 Game OLR username on Skype Orange Launch Radio

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
I wanted to plug something on the website real quick

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.000
It's an article that was just posted and I thought this was actually a pretty good idea

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Something that was posted by Dekeman

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Kind of a different contest here for the best Konami games

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Because you know Konami's 40th birthday is coming up in a couple weeks

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000
We are going to actually do on OrangeLaunchRadio.com

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:10.000
The top three favorite Konami games is what you post

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:14.000
And then we're going to count down like the top five games in special highlight articles

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
That's kind of fun

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
So kind of counting down the top Konami games

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Obviously we have a history with Konami here at this station

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:25.000
So I fully expect that BeatMania 2DX will be the number one

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
How can it not?

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:31.000
With our audience I would be shocked and odd if BeatMania 2DX is not number one

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
I'll tell you that wouldn't be my number one

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
I don't know

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
I'd have to sit down and think long and hard

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
I really have to look at like a big list of Konami games

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I would put some obscure shit in there though

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
I would tell you that

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
You know what the top of my list would be Rob?

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
What's that?

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Dracula X

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Oh that is Castlevania

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Now it's tough

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
You're on our website www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Let's go back to the phones because it's been ringing

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
And I'm sorry guys if I haven't been picking up

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
But I wanted to get that out there

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Hey it's Ron what's up everyone?

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Not much how you doing Rama?

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Good I'm recovering from restoring windows on my computer

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
But other than that life's been pretty good

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Yeah

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Good good

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
What do we owe this phone call to tonight?

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Some information that I happened to come across

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
I meant to discuss the last time I spoke to you guys

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Now

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
As you know Sega was at

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Comic Con back in February

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
It seems

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
That another video game

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Company is looking into going

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
At the conventions as well

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
How so?

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Well as you guys know

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
I work for a company where we go to cons

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
We set up booths and we sell items

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Now we're doing

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
Anime Boston in May

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
And we just got information about

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
A couple of weeks ago

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
About two or three weeks ago

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
About our location and where we're going to be

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
It seems that our booth is going to be

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
You ready for this?

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Directly across from Nintendo

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Huh

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Interesting

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Wow okay

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
So Nintendo is going around the cons

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
What do you think they're going to be showing off?

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Do you think it's just the Wii or what?

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
I really don't know

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
I'm thinking either

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
It's going to be like a booth version of

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Nintendo World set up there

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Or um

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Actually Nintendo will be coming down with kiosks

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
With the displays that show off

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
A lot of games

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Hmm

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Considering the business that you're in

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
If it's what I think it is, if it's still the same

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
I think that's very funny that you're going to be directly across from Nintendo actually

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Well

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Because they kind of screwed us

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Over at one convention

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
They gave us first dibs and when we picked it

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
We found out afterwards that Nintendo is directly

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Across from us so

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Everyone at the booth will be doing Nintendo themed

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Cosplays

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Ha ha, I see, okay

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Trying to get some attention, very smart

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Well we try

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Very smart

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Well I expect a full report and pictures

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Because sadly Anime Boston, I don't think

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Considering I've got two other cons

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
I'm trying to weigh between, I don't think Anime Boston is going to happen

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
However

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
However, PAX East Coast

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
You know I want to go to that

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
Well you best be there man

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
That will be my arrival in Boston

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
And I have internet friends in that area that I want to go visit anyway

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
So it works out

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
So we'll see

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Well good luck with that

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Any other conventions coming up that we ought to know about are our listeners

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Well if you're in

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
New York, New Jersey, Tri-State area

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Coming up we have

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Castle Point Anime Convention, Hoboken, New Jersey

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
And ICON

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
29 I believe

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
One of East Coast's biggest

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
sci-fi conventions

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
It's sci-fi and medieval arts

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Alright

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Sci-fi and medieval arts

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
It reminds me of that whole

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Margaret Cho joke about

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Why is it that, you know, Star Trek

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Always seems to go hand in hand with the Ren Faire

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
I don't know, sorry

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Random thought

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
I don't know about you but Star Trek can go with

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Almost anything, you know

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
It really can, it really can

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
I'm gonna get some more calls but thank you so much

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Alright, later

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
There's a lot of you guys hammering the line tonight

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
I just don't want to try to get to as many calls as I can

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
DS Master 26

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Hi DS Master 26, what's on your mind?

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Much more game review

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
For ya, and uh

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
A few comments and suggestions for the show

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
Alrighty

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Well, um

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Cause I'm an F-Zero fan

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
I mean, who isn't in this house, you know

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Love F-Zero, wish they would

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
Put a new one out on the Wii already, yeah

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
And just to fill the time

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I'm waiting for a friggin' DS version

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
To come out, I have a PSP here

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
As you can tell, and so I'm like

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
You know, it's a lot better to fill it than wipe out

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Pure, right?

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
So, I'm like

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Okay

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
I storied up everything, I have

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
My friend Gamesafe who had all the classic

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Packs and everything, cause I can't tell them

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
For some weirdo reason, they closed the site

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
To download stuff from

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
But uh, it's a little bit more challenging

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
Than F-Zero, I'll tell you that

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
It is, I've played the Wipeout

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
On uh, Playstation Network, I can't remember the

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
Name of it, I think it's just Wipeout HD

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
And uh, it's a little harder

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Than F-Zero, it's such a different style

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Too, F-Zero to me is a little more

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Cartoony, but don't take that

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Too literally, you know what I mean? Like

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
F-Zero GX especially, which is one of my favorite

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Racing games ever, is not definitely

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
A cartoony looking game, but Wipeout feels a little

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
More, I don't know, just a little more

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
Edgy than F-Zero, but that doesn't

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Usually that's a term that means

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
One's better than the other, not in this case

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Yeah, and uh

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
I don't know, but like

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
It's so hard to get on your

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Channel sometimes, uh

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Have you guys ever thought of like, you know, doing

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Open mic or conference call

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
With Skype?

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Like AGI and DPL did?

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
What do you mean like

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Just opening it up so that every

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Person can come on and chat and stuff?

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
Perhaps

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
We like that, yeah

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
I think the only problem with that is that, you know

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
We try to cover a lot of ground during the show

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
And I think if we did that, we would

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Just, it would just kind of turn into this giant

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
You know, cluster of a show

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
What I would love, I would love to take calls

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Throughout the show, but we need like

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Somebody to screen the calls in order to be able

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
To do that to make sure people are gonna stay on topic

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Again, so the show can flow

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
One of the feedback I hear about the show very often is that

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
It's almost a little too long

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
So I would just be afraid that if we did kind of just

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
I mean, we got on enough tangents as it is

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
If we let it get on even more tangents

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
I'd just be afraid we'd be here for six hours

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
Which, you know, I do love this show

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
But, um

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
You know, I also love going to bed at a decent hour

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
So, but you know

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
That's why we do at least a Skype line, try to get the feedback

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
And I know not everybody can always get through

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
We try to do the emails and chat room comments

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
And we'd like to think, out of all the gaming

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Podcasts out there, we're one of the

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
More interactive ones that are out there

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
But I know there's other shows doing their thing

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
But speaking of all games and all that stuff

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
You know, look forward to

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
At E3

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
More of that kind of working together type of stuff

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
That maybe you saw at Penny Arcade Expo

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
I don't have anything down in writing for sure yet

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
But you can definitely see that

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
There will be some joining of the independent

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Podcast to do some stuff

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Come E3 this year, I would say that is

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Inevitable, and working

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
With the listeners for listener feedback

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
I mean, I would love to do

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Like live E3 shows

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Where the listeners can call in and ask us questions

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
And all that, but I don't know

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
If without the E3

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
What do they call that, E3 Arena this year

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
I don't know if that's going to be as possible

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
It's going to be interesting

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
SSG100, Matt

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Go ahead

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
I also saw an episode of

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Sessler's soapbox at Dollar Day

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
And actually, strange enough

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
I didn't get it from the

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
E3, E4 TV side of my PSP

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Because, get this, they closed down

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
The RSS feeds for PSP users

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Which kind of sucks

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
That's why I don't know if there's stuff on here before

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
But yeah, so I had to

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Go off iTunes and everything

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
I had to convert, it's crud

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
But the topic

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
I'm sorry, I don't understand why

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
You'd want to close out one of your

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Why would you want to shut the door on your listeners?

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
I mean, I guess when you're a TV station

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
And you have that type of money, you can make those types of decisions

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
But I just think it's crazy talk

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
To close the door

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
I mean, maybe it was costing them too much to produce

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
But how much can it cost

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
To translate a movie into PSP for

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
It seems a little silly, a little silly

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Yeah, and

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Sessler's soapbox was going on

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
About, you know, kids playing Emory games

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
And how, you know, it's no different

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Than some kid possibly

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
You know, seeing a radar movie

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
I mean, heck, when I was

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Eleven, I saw The Matrix

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
And I was, you know

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Radar, did I end up

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Going sniping people? No

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Frickin' Chad Thompson

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Who's

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Well, thank God, disbarred

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Um

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Needs to get head screwed on straight

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
I know, you know,

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Unfortunately, these guys

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Run with the one bad apple

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
That ruins it for the rest of us normal people

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
You know what I mean?

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Yeah, because of that, I mean, the only

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Way I was able to get my hands on

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
GTA LCS

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Was on Amazon with my debit card

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Yes, I have one

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
I used to have a job

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
But now I'm dead broke with only

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
One dollar twenty cents on my account

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Don't have enough to pay taxes, I am so screwed

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Oh no

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Starting to get a little depressing

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Alright, well

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Is there anything else you wanted to comment on

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Before we try to get some more calls?

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Um, yeah

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
You know, I kind of

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Listened back to episode 3, 12 and what

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Dan said, I went over to Game Shop

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
And whatever

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Like, sorry, we still can't give you a

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Replacement or whatever

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
And so

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Basically, I don't know

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
What else to go at here

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Other than spend twenty bucks

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
On a faceplate and whatever and replace

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Next, I think that might be the issue

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Yeah, it might be what you're gonna have to

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Yeah, unfortunately it might be what you're gonna have to do at this

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Point, I mean, I

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
No, no, I remember

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Yeah, I think this was

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
The same one, but I remember the email a while back

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
That Dan was responding to

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
About the, yeah

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
And it was kind of no guarantee

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
That it was gonna work, so unfortunately

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Yeah, you might just have to try and explore those

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Options that are gonna cost a little bit of money

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
I know you say you don't have no money right now

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
But, you know, I guess there

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Are some more things important than games

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Prioritize

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Yeah, because I spent

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
A bunch of money on my

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Prom date with my girlfriend who also

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Plays Destroy All Humans and says

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
That's better than GTA because she says

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Flying saucers are better than

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Pinks, but I don't know

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
What's your view on that?

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Prioritize

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Since I've been a prom date

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
Before, I wouldn't have wanted a whole lot of money

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Spent on me if it was at the expense

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Of someone being able to pay their bills

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
But, you know, it's all gonna be worth it

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Because we're gonna be watching Twilight

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Alright, well anyway, DS Master

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
We gotta let you go, we gotta get some more calls

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Before we end up, but thank you so much for your call

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
And good luck with the monies

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
I know it's a tight time for a lot of people right now

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
But things will work out, they always do

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Alright, good luck buddy

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Peace out and keep rocking the show

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Alright, we'll try, see ya

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Alright, we'll probably take like one more call on the

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Skypline of 1877 Game OLR

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
I wanted to read some comments

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
That were in chat

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
And now I can't find them, darn it

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
It was a little while ago

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
Oh, SSU100Matt says

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
OLR was the first show to use Skype

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
I still believe to this day that that is true

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
That we were, but

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
Nobody probably believes me, anyway, we got one more call

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
We'll take it, and then we're gonna wrap up the show

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
It's Death Wishing

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Hi, Death Wishing, what's on your mind?

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
First, I'd like to say, no more cock jokes

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Sure, you got a whole chat storm of cock jokes

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
And it was very, um

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
Alright

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Unfortunately that happens sometimes

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Is that one funny thing is said and the chat just won't let it die

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
But that's just part of the

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
It's a revival of the old big black cock

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
It's, it's, it's not a big black cock

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
It's charm?

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
I don't know?

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Oh, I forget, what did you call in about tonight?

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Um, I would like to comment on the guitar hero

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
You know, holy crap, there's a lot of them

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
For real, right?

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
I mean, did you hear earlier

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
When we were saying, can you hear the milking of the franchise?

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
I personally call it

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
You know the weird 30 year old guy

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
That stays in his mom's basement

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
And has an addiction to porn

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
It's pretty much, he's running out of Vaseline

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
You better watch it, because I've got two of those three

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
I'm 30 years old and addicted to porn

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
But do you live with your mom?

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
No, I don't, thankfully

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Alright

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Wait, so what about the guys that live with their mom?

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
These are the guys that are gonna be buying the games?

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
No, no, I'm just saying

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
That's like an example

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
That's an example of what they're doing to it

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
My problem is that the guitar hero games

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Aren't exactly the same as like Rock Band

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
Whereas Rock Band, say for example

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
You know, someone was actually

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Doing a comparison with the amount of games

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
That Rock Band releases, and to be honest

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
The games that they release, like the track packs

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Or whatever, it's just download content

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
That's available now on disc

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
It's not something that you necessarily need to buy

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
It's nothing new, unless you don't have internet

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:30.000
But the guitar hero games

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:33.000
They're all these different new tracks

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
That you can't dump together

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
So you have to buy all these games

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
And each one has to be played separately

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
And that's retarded

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
And that's one thing I really like about Rock Band 2 as well

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Is that it seems like the developers of Rock Band

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Are continuing to add to Rock Band 2

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Granted, yeah, you got the ACDC game

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
But they didn't really bother to promote that that much

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
It was just kind of a one-off thing

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Like, hey, this is out there, you can get this

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:58.000
And then everything is pouring into Rock Band 2

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
They have all this regular content

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.000
And sure, okay, the Beatles game is going to be

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
A completely separate game

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
But it's the fucking Beatles, they're allowed

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Well, that's the deal that they had

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
They would have done it as a Rock Band track pack

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
But the people that have the Beatles license

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
They're like, uh, no

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Which, again, it's the Beatles, they're allowed

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
There's not a lot of bands I'd say that for

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
But with Guitar Hero, yeah, I mean, come on

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
The greatest hits

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
The sub-par 80s game

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Pretty much, if you want greatest hits

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
Just pick up the

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Dish, you'll probably be able to get it cheaper

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Well, even the greatest hits isn't so bad

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Because they're expanding on it

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
And that's fine, but

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
I don't know, it's just

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
It's all these games

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
And all these artist-specific games

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
To me, it sounds very risky

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Because not everyone loves Metallica

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
Not everyone loves Van Halen

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Not everyone loves Aerosmith

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
I mean, so

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
And the other thing, too, they're all

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Well, you know, you get like 40-some tracks

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
For, you know, 60 bucks or whatever

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
That's a great deal

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
I might not want all those tracks

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
At least with Rock Band, I can pick and choose what I want

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
And that's why I love Rock Band

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
You know, yeah, from a gamer standpoint

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Right now, I, you know

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
Somebody who's been playing music

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Games for about 10 years now

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
I definitely prefer Rock Band to Guitar Hero

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
At this point in time

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
For these reasons that we've been stating

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
It's just

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
A better package to me

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
And plus, also, consider this

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
The Guitar Hero on tour, the DS one

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
Eh, you know, what are they trying to do with that?

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
DS one gives you carpal tunnel

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Yeah, they're trying to condense

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
The guitar playing experience into the DS

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Which just doesn't really work

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
And honestly, those DS games, they're about

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
As different with each other as, unfortunately

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
The guitar-free schemes in their arcades

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
Trackless update, trackless update

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Let's reskin it a little bit, done

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
But, the Rock Band game that's coming out

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
For PSP, where they're kind of

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
Now taking this different approach to it

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Where it's gonna be more like frequency or amplitude

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
If the rumors are to be believed

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
That sounds awesome!

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
No stupid peripheral to plug in my PSP

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Just making music

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
And in a way

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
That's just different from

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
It sounds great

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
Dang moment

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Here's a thought, this would be kind of cool

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Can you imagine if they were to do

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
A game like that, for say the 360

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Or whatever, and the PS3

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Kind of like this amplitude Rock Band thing

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
But, it took all the music that you

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
Downloaded from Rock Band and allowed you to

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
Use that

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Jizz in my pants

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Isn't that pretty much audio surf?

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
It basically is, sort of

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
Audio surf is more of just a game that's a rhythm

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
Stuff, it doesn't add elements

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
To the music, you don't

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Play the drum track and play something else

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Yeah, audio surf also

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Can kind of be a little hit and miss

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
If you play a song with a very strong beat

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
It'll be a lot better than just

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
It's just like those

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
DDR games, what was like the Codemasters

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
Game where you could play any CD

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Dance Factory or whatever

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
A lot of songs in Dance Factory

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
I've not really heard of that

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
We know a lot of obscure shit here, but there was a

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
DDR knock off where you could put in your own CD

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
And get the arrows generated

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
And it was very hit and miss, mostly miss

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
Dude

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
Alright, well hey, any other

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Final thoughts before we get on out of here?

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
I went to UCLA

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
And they have two street fighter cabinets

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Four cabinets there

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
At UCLA, really?

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Big scene there? Were they busy?

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Well, I went there when it was lunch

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Because I'm not that old, I'm only 16

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
I went on a field trip there

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
And there was like

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
It was lunch time, there was about

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Maybe 10 people

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
In there, I guess at lunch, you know, some people

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Could be in classes or something, but they also had

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
King of Fighters and Street Fighter 3

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
You know, and it was just like

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
They all

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
It was pretty much like the

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
All the Asian games you want to play

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
Since you're in the LA area, have you ever been to an arcade out there

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Called Arcade Infinity?

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
No. It's out in City of

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Industry, and actually we've

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Back in the day when we were much more into the DDR

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
And Beatmania, we would drive all the way from Sacramento

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
Where we're based, to go to this arcade

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
To play some of the legendary games

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
There was the Gundam game

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
That was epic

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
There were just so many epic games

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
I haven't been there in a long time, but I imagine they've got

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Quite a crowd of people, too, around these fighting games

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
So, you know, there's definitely an audience

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
For it, and it's

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
The only arcades I ever really went to were like

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
I think the Sega one I knew

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Oh, Gameworks?

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
No, it was all Sega

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
But then it got turned into Gameworks, I think

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Oh, because I knew that Gameworks was a Sega arcade

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
I think I know what he's talking about

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
I can't remember

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
I might have been there once, but anyway

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
It had this awesome helicopter game where you rolled around

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
The Sega 360

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
Was that the Tatsu?

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Was that a Sega thing?

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
That's the Sega 360

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
It's a lot better than the Tatsu thing

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
Oh, okay. A little different

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
But arcades are pretty much dead now

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
And it's sad, because

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
All the online gaming

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Has really put a dent in it

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
It's gonna take something epic to bring people back

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
But who knows? Maybe when the recession

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
I know a way to bring back arcades

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
Real quick, what is it?

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
Boobs

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
We'll see what happens

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Alright, Deathwishing, we gotta let you go to wrap up this show

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
Good luck on your quest for boobs in arcades

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Alright

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
I'll be a millionaire one day, just watch

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Alright, you heard it here first

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
Alright, take care, buddy

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
Bye

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
I think everybody's thought about trying that

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Like mixing a strip club with an arcade

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
With, I don't know, maybe there's local laws

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
I approve

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
No, I mean

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
That's just a strip club with an arcade in it

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
The problem is, though, is you really want

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
I mean, they don't want

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Arcade games in a strip club

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Because one, you have to pay money to get into a strip club

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
And two, it takes away from the time

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
That the strippers have with you, so they can't get paid

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
What if you got a lap dance

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
While playing, you know, Street Fighter IV

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
That'd be distracting

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Yeah, it would be a little distracting

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
I tried

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
Alright, we're gonna take a minute to wrap up the show here

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
But a strip club with video game themes

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
That could be dual

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Or video games and anime themes

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
That could be dual

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
Alright

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
That sounds like a bad convention

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
Like a cosplay strip club

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
But not with nasty looking chicks

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
It's not like when Consumer Electronics Show is going on

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
At the same time as the adult video convention

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
That kind of thing

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Remember they just need to combine them into one

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Alright, we gotta wrap up the show

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Enough silly talk, we need to wrap up the show

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
We're running a little long tonight, which is fine

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
We've had a good show, a lot of good discussion tonight

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
And yeah, it was a good show, good calls, good discussion

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Good chat, I'm feeling good about tonight's show

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
So thank you all for making it a success

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Let's get some, I don't think there's any more

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
Last minute stories, right Loki?

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
Yeah, there's some Guitar Hero stuff

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Coming out this month, including Queen

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
No, well, download tracks

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
Including Queen

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Oh, well, that is epic

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
I will promise a story for Queen

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Yeah, so there's some interesting songs

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Including, I'm trying to think what they were now

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
As I pull this up

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
I think Killer Queen was one of them

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
Which is interesting

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
And then

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Let's see here

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
It was nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
Or anything cool like that, unfortunately

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
Um

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
Sorry

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Let me just pull this up here

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
Killer Queen

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
That's interesting, because there was a cover

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Of that in Guitar Freaks back in the day

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Maybe that was the only

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
Um

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Maybe that was the only Queen song

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
From the download content

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
I think there was only one or two, wasn't Bicycle in it?

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
I don't remember, Fat Bottom Girls or something

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
I don't know, they need them all

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
This is interesting, because Queen's

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
Supposed to be in SingStar too

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
They had

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
Yeah, Killer Queen

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
Which is going to be part of

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
The Queen Track Pack

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
We Are the Champions

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
Actually, no, Killer Queen isn't in that

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
It's We Are the Champions, Fat Bottom Girls

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
And Celebrity

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
And those are all going to be available in the Queen Track Pack

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
On March 26th

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
The week before that, they're going to have the Jimi Hendrix

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
Track Pack with Freedom, Angel, and

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
Foxy Lady, the live version

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
Nice, on March 19th

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
Also available on March 19th would be the European

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Track Pack

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
I'm not sure if these were available in Europe

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
I'm sure it might be just European bands

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
With What Have You Done

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
By Within Temptation

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
I Are Comet Alex

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
By Dai Toten Hosen

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
And Carolina

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
By MClan

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
And then finally, available last week

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Break It Out by Vanilla Sky

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
In the Shadows by

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
Rasmus

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
And Cies Komesa

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
By Lesrita

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Mitsuko

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
I don't know, I think I butchered that last name

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
Mitsuko

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Yeah

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
Alright

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Ok, we gotta wrap up, we're gonna get all the closing

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
thoughts and wrap on out of here for tonight

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
We are running a little long tonight

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Show's very, very long, but that's alright, it was a good show

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
Dark Sakura, your final thought for us tonight

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Happy birthday, Chris

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
I agree, happy birthday, Chris

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
How dare I not say anything, I left her message on Facebook

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
earlier, but you know, just got sidetracked with the show

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
Yes, happy birthday

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Chris, one of the OLR lesbians

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
My final thought

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
would be, I

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
am craving

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
Pringles

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
And no, this isn't a G4 show

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
back in the day, we're all sponsored by Pringles

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
but I really am craving Pringles, Loki, your final thought

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
I am not craving

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
Pringles, Pringles are nasty

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
Pringles are not nasty, you're nasty

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Alright, we're done, we're out of here

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Have a great week, thank you guys so much for downloading

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
whatever the case may be, or watching on Justin TV

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
even if you're doing that, thank you guys for listening to

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Orange Lounge Radio for yet another week, remember

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
friend, tell somebody about the show

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000

that the show is on, whatever it is

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because we do

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
rely on word of mouth to get the word out there

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
and that's all we ask, otherwise

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
