00:00.000 --> 00:20.880
Today, March 15, 2009, GamePro goes game publisher, Call of Duty passes a landmark for online

00:20.880 --> 00:29.760
play, and which company is giving away a free game this week?

00:29.760 --> 00:35.960
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.960 --> 00:41.200
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:41.200 --> 00:42.200
lifestyle.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.920
And we tape live every Sunday night on allgames.com.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.680
That's www.allgames.com, All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show about

00:50.680 --> 00:55.680
six o'clock Pacific Standard Time on the West Coast, nine o'clock Eastern for the East Coast.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.640
My name is Robert, I'm just joining you here every week.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.080
Joining us also every week, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.080
How's it going?

01:03.080 --> 01:04.080
I'm good.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.080
How are you, Tech Master Loki?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.080
Doing good.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.480
All right, excellent.

01:07.480 --> 01:12.560
And also joining us tonight, running fresh in from inside the house, live radio.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.040
Say hello to the one and only, Jamie Summers, how you doing?

01:16.040 --> 01:18.520
I had beer last night and I feel good.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.520
Did you?

01:19.520 --> 01:20.520
Congratulations.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.520
Much beer was had.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.520
But you always drink responsibly, correct?

01:22.520 --> 01:25.600
Yep, that's why I have someone else be responsible for me.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.600
All right, excellent.

01:26.600 --> 01:31.320
All right, and of course, not only do we tape live on All Games Radio, but you can also

01:31.320 --> 01:33.240
watch our video feed on Justin TV.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.560
Just before the show went live tonight, we were taking a peek at Madworld on the Nintendo

01:36.560 --> 01:40.240
Wii, which I guess has quickly become one of Loki's favorite games?

01:40.240 --> 01:41.240
Yes.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.720
And what is it about Madworld that you're loving?

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
Everything.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.520
You brutally murder people.

01:46.520 --> 01:52.040
Yeah, I saw you throw the guy into the air jet or something like that, just blood everywhere.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.440
Describe this game a little bit for those that have no idea what this game is or the

01:54.440 --> 01:58.320
fact that a game like this exists on the Nintendo Wii of all things, try to describe this game

01:58.320 --> 01:59.320
real quick.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.800
This game is sort of like, um, a little bit like The Running Man.

02:02.800 --> 02:08.800
Basically, you are... the terrorists have taken over this one city and they've kind

02:08.800 --> 02:12.840
of created this giant murder game show out of it.

02:12.840 --> 02:17.120
And you're this guy, Jack, who decides to go ahead and enter this.

02:17.120 --> 02:22.040
And basically all the contestants have a poison that's in them and they have to win the competition

02:22.040 --> 02:23.700
to get the antidote.

02:23.700 --> 02:28.520
So that's what he's doing is trying to kill everybody to get to rank number one.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.880
Was this a Stephen King novel?

02:31.880 --> 02:32.880
No.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.200
Except they were running.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.920
That was the Long Walk, Rob.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.920
Similar.

02:37.920 --> 02:38.920
Similarities, though.

02:38.920 --> 02:43.560
But basically, the whole game looks like it's a black and white comic book with lots of

02:43.560 --> 02:46.360
splashes of red when you brutally murder people.

02:46.360 --> 02:51.200
And I mean, everything from snapping people in half at their spine to cutting them in

02:51.200 --> 02:56.760
half with a chainsaw in multiple ways, to throwing them against a spike wall, to setting

02:56.760 --> 03:00.440
them on fire, stabbing them with, you know, street signs.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.160
There's so many different ways to kill people.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.480
It's like, yeah, the graphics are like that old joke.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.600
You know the old joke, what's black and white and red all over?

03:06.600 --> 03:09.960
But, you know, it's like the newspaper is like the riddle or if you're a smart ass,

03:09.960 --> 03:12.320
it's a zebra that just got shot.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.000
But now you could say what's black and white and red all over.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.560
Mad World is really what the graphics look like.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.200
You are black and white and occasionally red.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.200
It's very red.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.560
As it is, you know, the game would be awesome just with that.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.760
But oh no, Sega does not just stop there.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.280
They decide that we need sports commentators as well.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.280
And who'd they get?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.400
Greg Proops and John DiMaggio.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.640
John DiMaggio you might remember as the voice of Bender and Greg Proops from Whose Line.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.560
They should have gotten Madden.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.560
John Madden?

03:42.560 --> 03:45.240
John, or at least Frank Caliendo.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.920
You gotta, that would be awesome.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.760
You gotta save something for the sequel though.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.760
And I can guarantee there will be a sequel.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.460
And honestly, Greg Proops is amazing and, you know, he was the announcer in Star Wars

03:55.460 --> 03:57.800
Phantom Menace during the podrace, right?

03:57.800 --> 03:58.800
I think so.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.520
Anyhow, enough fanboy over Mad World.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.680
I'm sure Loki will talk about this a little more in just a minute.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.800
But first, we're gonna get to how was your gaming week and we do always start it off

04:06.800 --> 04:07.800
ladies first.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.960
Um, I played some Ragnarok.

04:10.960 --> 04:11.960
That's really about it.

04:11.960 --> 04:16.480
We've actually been having a different sort of gaming experience in my house, which is

04:16.480 --> 04:19.120
called Cleaning Out the Vault.

04:19.120 --> 04:25.360
I found so much E3 swag and no one, no one wants any of it, guys, trust me, it's shit.

04:25.360 --> 04:30.640
Um, but we've been piling up our systems and realized that we have four Saturns, two Coleco

04:30.640 --> 04:31.640
Visions.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.240
Dude, I want a Saturn.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.240
Talk to my husband.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.240
I have two Saturns.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.240
No, I don't, I don't.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.240
I don't know why I would.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.240
I have two Saturns I don't play.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.240
What would I play on the Saturn, seriously?

04:40.240 --> 04:44.000
But we're debating taking one of our systems and doing a giveaway with it and having, you

04:44.000 --> 04:48.240
know, us autograph it or something, you know, maybe who wants a Coleco Vision?

04:48.240 --> 04:49.240
Hey.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.240
Uh, okay.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.920
Good luck getting that shit to work.

04:51.920 --> 04:52.920
It works just fine.

04:52.920 --> 04:53.920
Does it really?

04:53.920 --> 04:54.920
Coleco Visions are awesome.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.560
Can you even hook those up to newer TVs?

04:56.560 --> 05:02.720
We actually would be, yes, you can do, they have the, um, RCA or not RCA, the, uh, RF.

05:02.720 --> 05:08.100
Yeah, they have an RF, but, um, but we also have, um, uh, drive two driving wheels.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.920
So we'd have a spare driving wheel.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.720
One of ours is Canadian.

05:11.720 --> 05:18.200
Um, we have my Super Nintendo, which was the very first system I bought with my own money.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.200
That was cool.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.040
And the person who owned it before me smoked because it's all yellow.

05:23.040 --> 05:30.880
Um, so yeah, we've got piles of stuff just hanging around and so, hey.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.920
All right, maybe a giveaway, maybe.

05:33.920 --> 05:41.060
Maybe, but we, we did also, um, we have a stack of old, um, strategy guides.

05:41.060 --> 05:42.760
A number of them from the eighties.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.700
Hey, some of that stuff goes for money on eBay.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.280
We have how to win at Castlevania.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.280
That's funny.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.280
Nice.

05:51.280 --> 05:55.440
You win at Castlevania, buy a Dracula, whoo, like in a car.

05:55.440 --> 05:59.600
Uh, I'm going to also introduce the chat room right now at this time, chat.orangelandraday.com

05:59.600 --> 06:03.700
always when we're taping live on Sunday nights, you know, the listener experience and getting

06:03.700 --> 06:06.040
to interact with the show is really what makes this show unique.

06:06.040 --> 06:11.320
Um, just kind of reading some comments here from the chat room, um, Tigerclaw says Greg

06:11.320 --> 06:12.920
Proops is awesome.

06:12.920 --> 06:18.280
Black Wolf points out John DiMaggio is also the voice of Marcus Fenix and he should have

06:18.280 --> 06:23.000
done it, and I'm sorry, Quiltipo says John DiMaggio should have done it in his Waka voice.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.040
Maybe, I don't know about that.

06:26.040 --> 06:29.920
Waka kind of got on my, oh, Waka kind of got on my nerves by the end of Final Fantasy X,

06:29.920 --> 06:31.360
but maybe that's just me.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.920
Uh, let's see, other thoughts on gaming week.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.560
Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:35.560 --> 06:41.760
My gaming week was good, I, um, played a few things actually this week, um, starting off

06:41.760 --> 06:47.880
with an, I don't know why I decided to try this, Pagle DS.

06:47.880 --> 06:53.080
Why have I, you know, it's sad that I found Pagle now, because it is quite addicting.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.320
Um, Yeah, wait, I don't know why you're knocking it, isn't it?

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
Isn't this a good thing?

06:57.320 --> 07:01.000
I'm not knocking it, I'm saying, ah, Pagle, there's something else to be addicted to,

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
okay.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Oh, okay, I gotcha.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.800
It was kind of fun, um, so, that's pretty cool, and, um, have you checked out the one

07:07.800 --> 07:08.800
on Xbox yet?

07:08.800 --> 07:09.800
No.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.440
Okay, because I was going to ask you, how is it different on the DS, well, have you

07:12.440 --> 07:13.840
played any other version of Pagle?

07:13.840 --> 07:14.840
No.

07:14.840 --> 07:15.840
Okay, then never mind, you can't answer my question.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.480
I was going to ask, is it, how is it different on the DS, but I guess you can't answer that.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.500
It's not really that different, I don't think, from anything else, it's, I mean, basically,

07:23.500 --> 07:27.880
you control it with the stylus to aim, and then when you hold the stylus in one spot,

07:27.880 --> 07:30.080
it'll zoom in, and then you can fine aim with that.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.080
Oh, that's pretty cool.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.880
And then, um, you know, you stop, button, and it'll shoot, and that's it.

07:34.880 --> 07:35.880
Um.

07:35.880 --> 07:39.440
SSJ100Matt asks the wife test question, asking would Nellie play Pagle?

07:39.440 --> 07:42.920
Maybe, I haven't shown it to her yet.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.920
You've got cookies!

07:44.920 --> 07:45.920
Um.

07:45.920 --> 07:51.880
For those that are randomly yelling out, my roommate just popped in the studio here, um,

07:51.880 --> 07:56.240
and it has a really big smirk on his face, I'm trying to figure out, oh boy, okay, John

07:56.240 --> 07:57.960
wants to speak on the show.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.440
Did we give you a nickname on this show, John?

08:01.440 --> 08:02.440
My roommate?

08:02.440 --> 08:05.280
My secret nickname is either Roommate or John.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.480
Okay, your secret nickname is Roommate or John, we gotta get you a mic here.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.480
Alright.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.760
Your superhero name would be the roomie.

08:10.760 --> 08:16.480
I'm gonna make this short, um, I don't usually play tons and tons of video games, but iPhone

08:16.480 --> 08:21.960
game app called Arveil, completely amazing, old school Final Fantasy style game, haven't

08:21.960 --> 08:26.520
been able to stop playing it for like three days, and it's fantastic, and I actually paid

08:26.520 --> 08:30.240
for the paid version, which is unspeakable and unheard of.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.240
So that's my little plug.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.160
Wait, tell us a little, how'd you find this game?

08:34.160 --> 08:36.640
Tell us a little more about how it plays, because this is unheard of that you actually

08:36.640 --> 08:40.800
want to participate in the show, and about video games, and not making fun of me, so

08:40.800 --> 08:44.600
I'm, I definitely want to know a little bit more about how you found this and how it plays

08:44.600 --> 08:48.320
and all that, like, you know, how do you control it on an iPhone?

08:48.320 --> 08:52.880
It's pretty simple, there's a little action button for most things, and there's a little

08:52.880 --> 09:00.200
control pad, so it's, you know, left, right, up, down, diagonals, um, found it going through

09:00.200 --> 09:06.920
strategy games that were free on the iPhone, and then liked it so much I bought the paid

09:06.920 --> 09:07.920
version.

09:07.920 --> 09:14.080
It plays like an old school Final Fantasy, like, maybe Final Fantasy 5 or so, I think,

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
and...

09:15.080 --> 09:19.240
Wait, am I filling in for Jamie?

09:19.240 --> 09:24.480
Am I supposed to, like, grow tits tonight, or be extra sassy?

09:24.480 --> 09:27.920
She's just going to the loo, I think.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.240
She's going to the soda, which is kind of like the loo?

09:31.240 --> 09:33.480
Maybe we should keep the soda in the bathroom.

09:33.480 --> 09:37.520
Okay, um, what else was I going to ask, though?

09:37.520 --> 09:40.520
Is this game available anywhere else that you know of, or, because some folks in our

09:40.520 --> 09:44.040
chat room are saying, I don't have an iPhone, so are they just screwed?

09:44.040 --> 09:49.040
Then I would say that their life is incomplete and they need to go buy an iPhone.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.040
These are obvious things.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.720
I don't know why I'm having to tell your listeners this.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.520
Apple thanks you for the free plug.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.520
All right.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.800
All right, well, thank you, John, for your contributions.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.560
Wait, you forgot to wave to Justin.TV.

09:59.560 --> 10:00.560
They're very mad.

10:00.560 --> 10:05.160
They had to look at your butt the whole time you were talking, and now they want some recognition.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.160
All right.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.960
Anyhow, uh, Loki.

10:07.960 --> 10:08.960
I'm so sorry about that.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.040
Anyways, that's okay, that's okay.

10:12.040 --> 10:18.240
Other than Pagel DS, I also played Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, which is interesting.

10:18.240 --> 10:22.480
It's definitely a different take on Grand Theft Auto, well, not that different, I mean,

10:22.480 --> 10:29.360
it's very similar to 1 and 2, but having come off of 4 and Lost and Damned, it is kind of

10:29.360 --> 10:36.800
hard to go back to the 2D stuff, or top-down Grand Theft Auto games, but it's okay.

10:36.800 --> 10:43.160
Very similar to the older games, they did add some neat touch screen stuff into it as

10:43.160 --> 10:45.400
well.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.960
Haven't played a whole lot of it yet, so I can't give a full impression on it yet, but

10:48.960 --> 10:51.000
it's okay so far.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.560
Storyline's kind of, eh, but we'll see, I mean, it might get better, but right now it's

10:56.560 --> 10:59.200
kind of cheesy.

10:59.200 --> 11:05.200
And then, other than DS stuff, I have also played, of course, more Lost and Damned, still

11:05.200 --> 11:07.860
lots of multiplayer in that.

11:07.860 --> 11:11.880
Playing around with the glitch of the game, there's a spot where pedestrians spawn in

11:11.880 --> 11:14.200
the middle of the air and fall from the sky.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.640
Sounds kind of fun.

11:16.640 --> 11:22.720
And then, I played a little bit of PS3 today, I went ahead and finally got around to playing

11:22.720 --> 11:27.640
the little big planet Contra levels, so that was kind of fun.

11:27.640 --> 11:33.000
And I also went and played Nobby, Nobby Boy for a few, I would say, yeah, a few seconds

11:33.000 --> 11:39.880
until Nelly's like, that bass sound when you're stretching is really fucking annoying, so

11:39.880 --> 11:44.360
I had to turn it off, so I stopped playing that.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.600
Yeah, pretty much.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.600
She cracked the whip, you had to stop playing.

11:47.600 --> 11:52.640
And then, of course, you know, Mad World, you know, that game's awesome in all sorts

11:52.640 --> 11:56.440
of ways, and unfortunately I haven't really made it past the first level, because I haven't

11:56.440 --> 12:00.920
gotten a chance to actually sit down and play it for a long enough time, so.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.600
The first level's really cool, though, so I can't wait.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.920
Alright.

12:05.920 --> 12:11.400
Well, my gaming week was actually pretty busy, considering I was out of town for like three

12:11.400 --> 12:14.680
days, I didn't think I'd have a very busy gaming week, the only thing I really played

12:14.680 --> 12:16.840
on the plane was Metroid Zero.

12:16.840 --> 12:21.000
Yes, I went back, and it's my second favorite Metroid game, next to Super Metroid, I went

12:21.000 --> 12:25.560
back and played on my DS, the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot, Metroid Zero, because that

12:25.560 --> 12:29.160
game is pretty fantastic, especially because I'm such a fan of Super Metroid, of course

12:29.160 --> 12:33.320
I'm going to like Metroid Zero, it's practically the same thing, but, you know, with different

12:33.320 --> 12:34.440
levels and a different layout.

12:34.440 --> 12:38.480
So if, you know, you need an oldie but goodie to check out, because this game's probably

12:38.480 --> 12:42.240
about five years old now, I think it's from 04, check out Metroid Zero, it was one of

12:42.240 --> 12:46.880
the last Advance games, I think, before they started switching over to DS stuff.

12:46.880 --> 12:53.620
Otherwise, as far as other stuff goes, I actually took a trip last night with Rice Princess,

12:53.620 --> 12:57.160
we went out to Roseville Golf Land, which is the local arcade, and we've given it a

12:57.160 --> 13:01.480
lot of crap on this show, because Roseville Golf Land is the place where games go to die.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.040
That's what we've always talked about here on the show, because you go there and, you

13:04.040 --> 13:07.160
know, you just have to imagine, for those, you know, I know not everybody lives where

13:07.160 --> 13:12.280
we live and knows this place, but it's a giant castle with a big golf course and a big water

13:12.280 --> 13:16.880
park that they're known for, but it's just like they let little kids just run the frickin'

13:16.880 --> 13:20.560
place because of it, and, of course, they don't know how to treat machines, parents

13:20.560 --> 13:23.040
don't know how to police their children in a place like that, so the machines-

13:23.040 --> 13:24.240
And they change their diapers on the machines.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.760
Are always, yeah, oh god, and if you think she's lying, that's a completely true story,

13:27.760 --> 13:31.960
that a diaper was once changed on a keyboard mania machine, but regardless, the machines

13:31.960 --> 13:36.280
run down, broken, bleh, but we heard they got a BeatMania 2DX machine, so we had to

13:36.280 --> 13:38.540
go check it out, and you know what?

13:38.540 --> 13:44.260
We went, and I hadn't been in like a year, 18 months or so, and color me shocked, but

13:44.260 --> 13:46.440
the place looked really nice.

13:46.440 --> 13:50.600
Like they remodeled or something, they did some repainting in there, I didn't find a

13:50.600 --> 13:54.440
machine that was broken, everything looked to be in a good state, I mean, granted, I

13:54.440 --> 13:59.260
saw a Supernova 2, the monitor was a little junky, but honestly, considering all the parts

13:59.260 --> 14:04.920
worked, the Max2 pads worked great, 2DX was in awesome condition, they've come a long

14:04.920 --> 14:05.920
way.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.640
I don't know if they're under new management or what the hell's going on over there, but

14:08.640 --> 14:11.200
we have to admit when things change for the better, and I think that-

14:11.200 --> 14:14.880
It's winter, that's why, no money for the water park.

14:14.880 --> 14:19.320
Maybe, I don't know, but I've been there in winter before and been extremely disappointed,

14:19.320 --> 14:23.360
so I don't know what's going on, but it's working, whatever they're doing, so props

14:23.360 --> 14:27.560
to those guys, and sorry for giving you so much crap, but I guess it worked, because

14:27.560 --> 14:32.480
the place was in a good state, so I played BeatMania 2DX Distorted, which I played before

14:32.480 --> 14:36.880
because I had it at E3 a few years ago, but I haven't really touched BeatMania 2DX in

14:36.880 --> 14:43.160
a long time, like it's been a long, long time, probably since this show took a more general

14:43.160 --> 14:48.080
gaming approach as opposed to just music video games that we used to do, but I missed it,

14:48.080 --> 14:49.080
it was fun.

14:49.080 --> 14:54.820
Granted, I found myself playing all old songs, but yeah, I definitely want to go back and

14:54.820 --> 14:55.820
play some more.

14:55.820 --> 15:00.000
I had a really good time playing BeatMania 2DX, although I still think the newer songs

15:00.000 --> 15:04.440
are not nearly as good as the older songs, I'm sorry to say.

15:04.440 --> 15:08.200
Questions from chat, Floatwalk wants to know, does R. Vigal still have Disney's Rave?

15:08.200 --> 15:12.120
Yes they do, I didn't play it though, but they do have Disney's Rave, and Rice Princess

15:12.120 --> 15:18.000
is actually in chat right now saying 2DX was in excellent shape and loud, so yeah, the

15:18.000 --> 15:20.800
machine was nice and loud, because you could turn the effectors on and all that.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.840
So tell them about, was it Guitar Hero Arcade?

15:22.840 --> 15:27.560
Yes, they had Guitar Hero Arcade which I played, I only played it once, so I can't really give

15:27.560 --> 15:31.600
a full review on it, I can just tell you I got pissed off, because Roseville Golf Land

15:31.600 --> 15:35.640
also switched to cards, they don't use tokens anymore, but cards, and when I was swiping

15:35.640 --> 15:38.960
the card through and everything, I somehow hit the button an extra time to start the

15:38.960 --> 15:43.000
game and I accidentally got on easy mode, and you can't switch it once you're on easy

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
mode.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.160
But to me, honestly, it just looked like the freaking home game, except a smaller song

15:50.160 --> 15:55.040
list, and it was just basically Guitar Hero 3 with a slightly smaller song list, and prettier

15:55.040 --> 15:59.760
because there's lights on the machine and it spins around and the TV they use is very

15:59.760 --> 16:04.820
very crisp, it's a very sharp image, but I don't know, would you want to pay a dollar

16:04.820 --> 16:08.200
a game for something you can get at home?

16:08.200 --> 16:11.480
But I understand there is an audience for this thing, and it's kind of cool to go out

16:11.480 --> 16:15.220
and play with your friends and all that stuff, so I can see where this machine might do decent,

16:15.220 --> 16:23.280
but if you have Guitar Hero at home, I don't see the point in this game, honestly.

16:23.280 --> 16:28.200
Let's see, what else did I do in my gaming week this week?

16:28.200 --> 16:32.720
I played the demo of The Last Remnant on the PC, and I was a little disappointed at how

16:32.720 --> 16:37.320
choppy it was, and I just bought this PC back in August, so I know it's not like old parts

16:37.320 --> 16:40.800
or anything, but I was a little disappointed at how choppy it was, but the game itself

16:40.800 --> 16:44.720
seemed kind of fun, so I might try to check it out on Xbox 360, although the PC wasn't

16:44.720 --> 16:47.120
supposed to have all the extra stuff.

16:47.120 --> 16:53.040
Pagle on Xbox Live Arcade, I downloaded and played for a while, and good times.

16:53.040 --> 16:58.160
You know, I was already addicted to the one online, it's Sparkles and Rainbows and Plinko,

16:58.160 --> 16:59.500
it's fun.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.520
I need to play some more of the multiplayer though before I can kind of give my full impressions

17:02.520 --> 17:05.680
on that, but I had fun playing Pagle, and I think a lot of people are going to check

17:05.680 --> 17:06.680
this out.

17:06.680 --> 17:11.880
What I like about Pagle versus PopCap's other efforts on Xbox Live, such as Bejeweled 2

17:11.880 --> 17:17.280
and Zuma, is that this doesn't just feel like a port of their PC game, the full one, it

17:17.280 --> 17:22.080
feels like they've really tinkered some stuff to work with Xbox Live, hence the multiplayer,

17:22.080 --> 17:25.280
and they've really kind of made it special for Xbox Live, and I think that's what's kind

17:25.280 --> 17:29.120
of cool about Pagle, it makes it really stand out amongst some of PopCap's other games they've

17:29.120 --> 17:30.360
had on Xbox Live so far.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.820
Not to say the other stuff was bad, but it was just kind of the same thing that I'd already

17:33.820 --> 17:39.120
played on PC if I'd had the full version, and Pagle's kind of a step above that.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.960
The last game I will mention that I played this week, Dance Dance Revolution Universe

17:42.960 --> 17:48.120
3 was on sale, so I figured, what the heck, I picked it up, I bought it, because I got

17:48.120 --> 17:53.000
a new dance mat for Xbox, whatever, and got to play Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Do you want to know what the most hilarious thing about Dance Dance Revolution Universe

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
3 is?

17:58.000 --> 18:03.160
Okay, they, on the back of the box, they advertise these songs that are in the game, one of them

18:03.160 --> 18:06.000
being harder, better, faster, stronger, right?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.180
So I was like, okay, I want to check that song out.

18:08.180 --> 18:09.680
It's not in the game.

18:09.680 --> 18:14.320
In fact, of all the songs that are mentioned on the back of the box, apparently only one

18:14.320 --> 18:18.880
of them is actually in the game, and no, it's not, like, I looked on web forums, DDR Freak,

18:18.880 --> 18:23.800
which is still kicking after all these years, who knew, DDR Freak apparently confirms these

18:23.800 --> 18:27.280
songs are not in the game, but they're advertised on the back of the box.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.280
Well, that's false advertising.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.280
I know!

18:29.280 --> 18:30.920
I say, we sue Konami.

18:30.920 --> 18:31.920
What's up with that?

18:31.920 --> 18:33.280
We'll turn it around on him.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.280
Look, I understand.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.760
No, we will sue Konami.

18:35.760 --> 18:40.800
I understand mistakes happen and all, but this is a pretty fucking big mistake.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.160
You know what I mean?

18:42.160 --> 18:43.160
I don't know.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.200
That's, that's, I'm surprised they're not trying to send out stickers to Critter.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.960
How does something like that happen?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.280
Like, who fucked up that bad?

18:50.280 --> 18:54.440
It's been out for a while, they probably just figured no one has noticed, you know?

18:54.440 --> 18:55.440
My god.

18:55.440 --> 19:01.040
Um, but look, look, the game itself, look, putting the box aside and all that trite crap,

19:01.040 --> 19:03.740
you know, the game itself is okay.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.880
It's not my favorite home version of a DDR game.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.720
In fact, I think I even preferred the song list in Universe 1.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.400
It's definitely no Ultramix 2.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.800
But it's not bad.

19:12.800 --> 19:19.360
The interface is pretty slick, very crisp, very vibrant graphics, funny background animations,

19:19.360 --> 19:23.680
2DX fan service, because they have the actual music video for Murmur Twins and some of that

19:23.680 --> 19:29.240
stuff in the game, decent licensed songs, some really cute kind of original stuff.

19:29.240 --> 19:33.360
A little heavy on certain in-house artists of Konami.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.400
I guess maybe there's just been a shift over there where they're starting to use people

19:36.400 --> 19:43.080
like Diamashura and 0039.com and some of these people are using them more often, it seems

19:43.080 --> 19:47.760
like, than your Naoki, your Takus, and all these guys that probably left, which is why

19:47.760 --> 19:51.000
they're having a shift.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.420
Also I thought it was strange, the download content, the interface, you can't preview

19:54.420 --> 19:57.800
the songs, I never heard of any of them, so I don't know what I want to download.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.480
Do they even have download content?

19:59.480 --> 20:00.640
My Universe, yeah they do.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.920
My Universe 1 songs though did not come into Universe 3, but apparently there's a Universe

20:04.920 --> 20:08.840
pack available, so I'm not sure if it's trying to make me re-buy the songs I already bought

20:08.840 --> 20:12.480
with Universe 1, and if that's the case, that's kind of crappy.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.560
There's a crap load of songs to unlock, so I'll give them a plus there.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.360
There's tons and tons of songs to unlock.

20:17.360 --> 20:24.260
Quest mode is a little silly though, and I hate how everybody speaks.

20:24.260 --> 20:28.920
Everybody talks like people think ghetto people talk.

20:28.920 --> 20:35.880
That's how the dialogue has gone, like the whole yo-dog type stuff, like, oh everybody,

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
it's just bad.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.360
Dialogue by Randy Jackson.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.360
It's bad.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.840
Leo Shan asks, was the quest mode like you got served Sky?

20:43.840 --> 20:44.840
No, it's weird.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.760
It's like this big circular thing, and you go to these different places, and in the first

20:48.760 --> 20:53.200
circle you gain coins to challenge people in the second circle, and if you beat them

20:53.200 --> 20:54.320
you get the song.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.840
It wasn't incredibly difficult.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.280
I unlocked the entire second circle in one night, but now it won't let me go to the third

21:00.280 --> 21:03.160
circle because I haven't played enough in the first circle, but I don't want to play

21:03.160 --> 21:06.680
the easy stuff, but whatever.

21:06.680 --> 21:10.720
Eventually you'll get to the seventh ring of hell.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.840
It's just like, here's the thing, I don't want to necessarily give this game a negative

21:13.840 --> 21:17.520
review because I don't think it's necessarily bad, and I do encourage people to play DDR

21:17.520 --> 21:21.480
because I think it's a way to stay fit and exercise, and again, I think everything's

21:21.480 --> 21:22.480
pretty sharp.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.120
I don't necessarily like some of the creative direction they took in it.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.560
I don't think the new quest mode is anything that exciting.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.920
I don't think the new interface is that great.

21:29.920 --> 21:35.960
I think having the giant CD cover box art thing in the wheels is a bit much.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.840
I don't go for it.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.960
I'm telling you, if you make me the production director of this series, I could bring it

21:40.960 --> 21:44.560
around like nothing.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.040
It's not necessarily bad.

21:47.040 --> 21:53.720
It's just another DDR game, and at this point these things are a dime a dozen, so I really

21:53.720 --> 21:59.720
want to see the DDR teams at Konami really try to reinvent this stuff, and for the love

21:59.720 --> 22:03.080
of God, whoever made that big mistake about putting songs on there that weren't actually

22:03.080 --> 22:12.040
in the game, that just kind of speaks as to how lazy they're getting.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.460
It's not necessarily a big deal, okay, so somebody made a mistake, whatever, but it

22:15.460 --> 22:20.000
just speaks volume as to how lazy it feels like they're getting with DDR, which is sad

22:20.000 --> 22:22.760
because I know there's a lot of people that work very hard on this series.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.080
I've had friends who worked for the series that work very hard on it.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.880
It's some of these creative things coming up from the top level.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.720
I'm surprised they didn't make a big deal about that everywhere, because hell, they

22:32.720 --> 22:38.240
made a big deal out of the IGN watermark being on the Okami cover, and that was something

22:38.240 --> 22:41.520
really stupid and small and had no impact really on the game.

22:41.520 --> 22:48.880
I don't know, and then there was Super Stardust Portable that was missing modes and stuff

22:48.880 --> 22:51.020
that were advertised on there.

22:51.020 --> 22:55.200
This is kind of a big deal that there's songs missing from the game that are advertised

22:55.200 --> 23:00.320
on there, because that right there, say if you bought it for that song, you're being

23:00.320 --> 23:05.080
ripped off right there, and the fact that it's not available for...

23:05.080 --> 23:08.840
I don't think even download content would cut it, and it would have to be free download

23:08.840 --> 23:13.240
content or a patch or something that would get automatically added to the game or something

23:13.240 --> 23:18.360
when you connect it live, but I don't know, it's just cheap and they could have easily

23:18.360 --> 23:24.800
affixed it with a sticker or something to go over that part of the box, that way it's

23:24.800 --> 23:30.240
gone or something, say at the last minute they decided to pull the rights to it or something.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.280
It screams lazy, that's all it is.

23:32.280 --> 23:35.960
And I'm just saying, companies, don't think we don't notice when y'all get lazy.

23:35.960 --> 23:42.000
There are people that notice and there are people that go, okay, I'm spending $60 of

23:42.000 --> 23:46.840
my money on this game, take five seconds to...

23:46.840 --> 23:48.720
It's like Nintendo again.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.560
Or delay it, that's what every other company does.

23:51.560 --> 23:57.320
The problem is, in their quest to branch out to people that haven't tried their games before,

23:57.320 --> 24:01.360
or people that normally don't play their games, they have in turn lost the people that do

24:01.360 --> 24:04.640
play their games, because they just don't care anymore.

24:04.640 --> 24:09.480
It's like shifting your focus to actually increase your market share with groups of

24:09.480 --> 24:13.680
people that don't normally play your games, and ignoring your core players and thinking

24:13.680 --> 24:18.200
they're just going to stick around is not the way to be thinking.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.600
Here's my challenge, this is my last thing I want to say, because I know there are people

24:21.600 --> 24:25.480
at Konami that listen to this program, and I'm not just talking about people that are

24:25.480 --> 24:28.800
like my personal friends and what have you, but I know there's people higher up.

24:28.800 --> 24:34.000
Look, less than three is one of the songs in freaking DDR Universe 3, the same song

24:34.000 --> 24:38.020
that was a theme song to Rice Princess' show she had on the old station, okay?

24:38.020 --> 24:43.160
If that doesn't prove somebody at Konami is looking out for us, I don't know what does,

24:43.160 --> 24:44.160
okay?

24:44.160 --> 24:48.520
Here's the thing I want to say to y'all, look, I love DDR, DDR has introduced me to a lot

24:48.520 --> 24:51.520
of great people, I would not know Loki, I would not know Dark Soccer if it were not

24:51.520 --> 24:58.000
for DDR, however, that being said, do not throw away a good thing, do not be afraid

24:58.000 --> 25:03.820
to reinvent yourselves, and I challenge you, step away from making, resist the temptation

25:03.820 --> 25:11.000
of doing a Universe 4, or X2, or Disney 3, I want you to nuke your code and start from

25:11.000 --> 25:17.560
the ground up, build a new DDR game from the ground up, no recycled code, make a brand

25:17.560 --> 25:21.120
new DDR game, and really try to push the limits of what you're doing with it, I think you

25:21.120 --> 25:25.820
would really stand to win back a lot of people that are starting to think you're getting

25:25.820 --> 25:26.820
a little lazy.

25:26.820 --> 25:30.480
They did it before, and what did it do for the community for a while, I mean it really

25:30.480 --> 25:35.960
rejuvenated everything when we got the Max series, remember when it was new?

25:35.960 --> 25:40.440
And honestly, DDR UltraMix, especially 2, not so much UltraMix 1, but UltraMix 2, and

25:40.440 --> 25:45.080
they really were getting in their groove, no pun intended, sold me on an Xbox, it really

25:45.080 --> 25:46.080
did.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.880
And that was all new code, because they had to make it for the Xbox.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.760
Also the other thing too, I think, is the way that they're treating their series, I

25:52.760 --> 25:57.880
mean look at Pump It Up, and the new versions of that game, there's a lot of excitement

25:57.880 --> 26:01.320
behind it, they bring it out, it's like, BAM, it's a new game, it's awesome, it's got all

26:01.320 --> 26:06.280
these things in it, and people get excited about it, but DDR, it's like, oh, new DDR,

26:06.280 --> 26:14.960
hooray, this time it's got more Disney characters, hurrah, it's just that no one cares anymore,

26:14.960 --> 26:18.960
and they need to really change it up, I'm serious, I have a way to fix this, but no

26:18.960 --> 26:24.320
one wants to listen, and I don't feel like explaining it, because, well, it's just, it's

26:24.320 --> 26:27.360
all in my head, and unfortunately I can't put it on paper very, you know, but I can

26:27.360 --> 26:32.800
explain it, basically the whole quest mode thing, taking a totally different approach

26:32.800 --> 26:38.000
to that, basically you have stuff that goes along, because the problem with quest mode

26:38.000 --> 26:43.020
is they don't know how to make it where it actually matters, I mean, you can't obviously

26:43.020 --> 26:47.440
do it as like a dance off competition thing, because it doesn't make any sense, it's just,

26:47.440 --> 26:51.840
you can't do that in DDR, because it's a technical game, it's not based on, you know, doing moves

26:51.840 --> 26:57.520
and that kind of crap, but if you make it as something different, like say for example,

26:57.520 --> 27:01.220
how well you're doing in a song affects the performance of say, something else that's

27:01.220 --> 27:06.280
going on, totally separate things, you know, just basically instead of, you know, your

27:06.280 --> 27:11.960
actions on a gamepad or something like that, it's based on the accuracy of, you know, the

27:11.960 --> 27:15.640
steps that you're hitting and that kind of stuff, if you make that interact with the

27:15.640 --> 27:20.160
other thing that's going on, you can make the quest mode about anything you want, and

27:20.160 --> 27:24.440
it doesn't have to be about DDR or anything, you can just really broaden it out there.

27:24.440 --> 27:29.160
Alright, we'll see if anyone's listening, you can contact Loki directly at loki at orange

27:29.160 --> 27:32.280
launch reader dot com, I'm sure he'll talk your ear off about it. Let me read some comments

27:32.280 --> 27:35.880
from chat, I don't want to spend too much more time on DDR, because since we have branched

27:35.880 --> 27:38.760
out the scope of our show, I know there's some people that listen that don't really

27:38.760 --> 27:44.400
care as much about the music games, but I will say this though, good exercise, you know,

27:44.400 --> 27:50.520
if you've never played DDR, try it for the exercise alone. Let's see, comments from chat,

27:50.520 --> 27:55.040
Float Walk says two words, national tournament, that's definitely what Pump It Up does, you

27:55.040 --> 28:00.120
know, the tournaments they do in Korea are huge, and Float Walk says for crying out loud

28:00.120 --> 28:05.720
the tournament scene made DDR's popularity in the states, true facts. Acidic Vampire

28:05.720 --> 28:12.160
says what DDR needs is violence like Madworld. DDR does not need violence, at least not that

28:12.160 --> 28:18.280
level of violence, I mean, no, it doesn't need that. DDR needs fatalities. But I do

28:18.280 --> 28:22.840
agree that you could take the quest mode and literally make it like an RPG type thing,

28:22.840 --> 28:29.840
you know, like it's, I don't know, it's, it's hard. No, no, no, no, no, no, I will tell

28:29.840 --> 28:34.420
you a reason why RPG stuff will never work with Dance Dance Revolution, and it all goes

28:34.420 --> 28:41.440
back to a little known game called Dance Dance Dance. No. I think I remember that game, yeah.

28:41.440 --> 28:47.560
Yes, I've played it, and yes it sucks. Alright, anyhow, let's move on, I don't want to spend

28:47.560 --> 28:51.640
too much time re-re-reminiscing the old days, although that's kind of what I did this week

28:51.640 --> 28:57.000
by going to Golf Land, so there you go. Alright, since that does it for our gaming week, let's

28:57.000 --> 29:00.680
get to some housekeeping. Alright, so look, we've sat here and kind of been critical of

29:00.680 --> 29:06.920
DDR for the last few minutes, but I will say this, you know, at our heart we do love Konami,

29:06.920 --> 29:13.160
and so on, on our website www.orangelandrater.com, they actually have been polling all of our

29:13.160 --> 29:17.840
listeners all week long about your top three favorite Konami games since their 40th birthday

29:17.840 --> 29:22.580
is coming up, and we're giving them a present now with this week long feature of the best

29:22.580 --> 29:27.880
games as selected by you guys, the listeners, from Konami's archives. 1500 Konami games

29:27.880 --> 29:34.320
over the years, if you can believe it. Speaking of voting, March Madness is almost over, it's

29:34.320 --> 29:39.600
down to the final four, and right now you have Rock Band versus Super Mario Bros. 3,

29:39.600 --> 29:44.960
and you have Chrono Trigger versus Zelda Link to the Past, and I believe voting time is

29:44.960 --> 29:48.720
going to be up very, very soon, so if you're listening live here on this Sunday evening,

29:48.720 --> 29:51.880
you're going to want to go try to get in your last minute votes, and the final two will

29:51.880 --> 29:58.920
probably be decided tonight. March 22nd, next week, I'm not going to be here, so I'm not

29:58.920 --> 30:03.440
sure if there's going to be a show or not. Stay tuned to our website www.orangelandrater.com

30:03.440 --> 30:07.640
for more details, I think they might try to find a way to tape elsewhere, but I will not

30:07.640 --> 30:11.220
be here next week, I'm going to be on a trip, but I will be back in two weeks, so we'll

30:11.220 --> 30:16.320
keep you posted. Alright, that's really it for housekeeping, just stay tuned to our website.

30:16.320 --> 30:20.760
Actually I want to say something about the website real fast, actually. I feel like I've

30:20.760 --> 30:23.560
kind of been slacking off, because I haven't been doing a lot of articles for the website

30:23.560 --> 30:28.840
or what have you, but it has been so refreshing to go to orangelandrater.com, and I'm seeing

30:28.840 --> 30:35.660
new stuff every day, it's completely unreal, but some of our long-time listeners, like

30:35.660 --> 30:41.280
Deakman, ActDeaf, DarkTedTsuya, and I'm sure the list goes on, I don't mean to leave people

30:41.280 --> 30:45.840
out, but they've been writing articles about indie game spotlights, games you ought to

30:45.840 --> 30:51.600
be playing, but you probably aren't, and highlighting music from video games, and it's been actually

30:51.600 --> 30:55.520
really cool to kind of go to the site and see this stuff. And what I love about it,

30:55.520 --> 30:59.920
is that in a way it's because we're not doing it, it's kind of what this show is all about,

30:59.920 --> 31:03.240
letting the listeners have control, and the community, and what the community wants to

31:03.240 --> 31:08.040
hear about, so props to you guys who've all been working hard on the website, it's been

31:08.040 --> 31:13.520
pretty awesome. And I have an idea for a feature too that I'm hoping to contribute very soon,

31:13.520 --> 31:19.080
and I'll be back on posting regular updates very soon. Okay, now I think that's it for

31:19.080 --> 31:23.040
housekeeping, let's get into some gaming news, we're only like 30 minutes into the show,

31:23.040 --> 31:29.960
let's get to it. Loki, start us off with some gaming news. Yes, so anyways, there has been

31:29.960 --> 31:41.960
some concern by MTV's Totillo that there might not be enough exclusives during 2009 for the

31:41.960 --> 31:48.320
Xbox 360. Now, unfortunately what Steven doesn't realize is that there are, but he just doesn't

31:48.320 --> 31:52.000
understand that there are a lot of things coming out that people think that aren't exclusive

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
are exclusive, and that they think that are exclusive that aren't exclusive, so it's kind

31:56.000 --> 32:05.400
of confusing. For example, he says the loss of Xbox exclusive franchises like Mass Effect,

32:05.400 --> 32:11.880
unfortunately for him, Mass Effect, I don't think, as of right now, is not, well it is

32:11.880 --> 32:17.620
multi-platform, but not with the PS3. So, you know, because right now I think there's

32:17.620 --> 32:23.360
only a SKU listing for the Xbox 360 version, I think the other platform they're talking

32:23.360 --> 32:27.000
about was PC, which makes sense, because they've released them both, but I think it is going

32:27.000 --> 32:31.600
to be exclusive for Xbox 360 right now. And Project Gotham Racing, well, Project Gotham

32:31.600 --> 32:35.680
Racing I don't think is even going to be existing anymore, at least if they are going to do

32:35.680 --> 32:39.080
another Project Gotham Racing game, I think it's not going to be called Project Gotham

32:39.080 --> 32:43.320
Racing, it'll probably be something different, but hey, who cares. And then of course Splinter

32:43.320 --> 32:47.960
Cell Conviction, whenever the hell that comes out, you know, obviously it might be one that's

32:47.960 --> 32:54.480
going to be on 360, and Alan Wake, also whenever that comes out as well. Then of course there's

32:54.480 --> 33:03.000
also Halo 3 ODST, or whatever they're calling it now, and I mean that's just for right now.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.360
Obviously they haven't really been talking much about their 2009 lineup, which they're

33:06.360 --> 33:10.180
probably saving for E3, you know, they're just going to be like, bam bam bam bam, here's

33:10.180 --> 33:16.320
all this shit, you know, that's coming out. But, do you think they are going to, at E3,

33:16.320 --> 33:22.720
just blow us away? Um, maybe. I mean, because there's, I can kind of see where this guy

33:22.720 --> 33:27.040
has some concerns for Xbox 360, because even, you know, they don't have a big Halo 3 this

33:27.040 --> 33:30.360
year or anything of that caliber, I mean, granted you had Halo Wars, but it's not the

33:30.360 --> 33:34.900
same thing. You know, there's no big, big must-have title, it feels like we got a lot

33:34.900 --> 33:41.200
of that last year. Well, they're not going to let us down with just, you know, the Halo

33:41.200 --> 33:45.340
ODST, and that could be what they consider their big title, but then again, that's also

33:45.340 --> 33:48.800
right now for September, that's scheduled for September. I mean, we very well could

33:48.800 --> 33:52.520
get something else, I don't know if they were going to get another Gears of War, to be honest

33:52.520 --> 33:57.920
I hope not, you know, give it some space, but I think there's going to be other things

33:57.920 --> 34:03.800
coming out for sure, because they definitely don't like leaving in a lot of months without

34:03.800 --> 34:08.240
a Microsoft game coming out, and you know, right now we just had Halo Wars come out,

34:08.240 --> 34:12.520
Ninja Blade's coming out pretty soon, you know, there's still a lot more months that

34:12.520 --> 34:16.560
there's nothing been announced yet, and I wouldn't be surprised if there's other things,

34:16.560 --> 34:19.680
and that's only first-party exclusives, we're not even talking about third-party exclusives

34:19.680 --> 34:25.120
yet, but you know, right now, there are a lot of companies that just don't want to develop

34:25.120 --> 34:29.640
for the PS3, or they're having trouble developing on the PS3, and it's taken them a lot longer

34:29.640 --> 34:34.960
to put out the PS3 version. For example, this isn't a great game, but Leisure Suit Larry

34:34.960 --> 34:40.760
boxed off his bus, coming out on 360 in a couple weeks, and the PS3 version's been delayed

34:40.760 --> 34:47.640
to May. Another one that people thought is also going to be exclusive to the Xbox 360,

34:47.640 --> 34:52.280
at least a timed exclusive, is Bioshock 2, right now I'm not seeing that, right now it's

34:52.280 --> 34:56.920
day and date with the PS3 version, but of course, that can change, that's months off

34:56.920 --> 35:02.200
right now, so I wouldn't be surprised if there is going to be a lot more stuff announced,

35:02.200 --> 35:06.920
and Bioshock 2 is going to be a huge Christmas title, but it's not specific to any system.

35:06.920 --> 35:11.240
Yeah, well, I think it actually is going to be coming out in August, just like it did

35:11.240 --> 35:15.560
the first time, but there's tons of stuff coming out that we don't know about yet, that

35:15.560 --> 35:21.840
are going to be big titles, and I'm sure that each side, both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 are

35:21.840 --> 35:26.760
both going to have exclusive titles that are going to be really awesome, so I don't really

35:26.760 --> 35:31.520
think it matters about the exclusive titles, because there's just more titles coming out

35:31.520 --> 35:39.640
on the Xbox 360 right now, period. Alright, you know, and also, one thing that Microsoft

35:39.640 --> 35:43.200
usually does, and I'm sure Nintendo and Sony are going to do this too, especially speaking

35:43.200 --> 35:47.960
of E3, you know, they like to unveil things to these big events that are available on

35:47.960 --> 35:51.360
live right now, or on PlayStation Network right now. There's something else too that

35:51.360 --> 35:55.080
I totally forgot about, Game Developers Conference, which I think is what, next week? Oh yeah.

35:55.080 --> 35:59.120
Yeah, so I mean, there's going to be announcements probably there as well, I mean, there's lots

35:59.120 --> 36:03.200
of stuff, and not only that, but they're not only focusing on just console stuff, I mean,

36:03.200 --> 36:09.320
you've got XNA, which is really hitting its strides now, Xbox Live Arcade, who knows what

36:09.320 --> 36:11.320
they're going to go with. I don't think at Game Developers Conference, though, you're

36:11.320 --> 36:15.840
going to get huge game announcements, but I think you'll get, like, infrastructure type

36:15.840 --> 36:19.440
things. Like, remember, Game Developers Conference was where, like, Home was announced. That

36:19.440 --> 36:25.600
was kind of an enhancement to Sony's platform. I don't think XNA was announced at, or no,

36:25.600 --> 36:29.600
I mean, XNA was, I mean, NXC, the new Xbox experience, I don't think that was announced

36:29.600 --> 36:32.240
at Game Developers Conference, but I could see that being the type of thing, you know,

36:32.240 --> 36:35.880
things that affect the developers, you know, things that affect the backbones of these

36:35.880 --> 36:39.200
systems, or the types of announcements I would expect to see, you know, upgrades and things

36:39.200 --> 36:42.500
of that note. Maybe this would be a great time for Nintendo to finally put out that

36:42.500 --> 36:47.080
SD card thing they've been talking about. That would be great. I've got a 2GB card right

36:47.080 --> 36:55.800
here, right here, just waiting to go in the Wii, to store all my crap. So, I'm hoping

36:55.800 --> 37:00.920
that thing will come out soon. Alright, well, there will be, actually, wait, I've got to

37:00.920 --> 37:03.160
read, there will be some comments from chat right now, that's the one I've got to read

37:03.160 --> 37:08.600
right now. AcidicVampire is betting at E3 this year, Microsoft will reveal that Final

37:08.600 --> 37:16.120
Fantasy XIII Versus will be on the Xbox 360. Hmm. I doubt that. You never know. GameGuru

37:16.120 --> 37:19.520
says, Microsoft at E3 will announce that the best non-Sony games that are appearing on

37:19.520 --> 37:25.040
PlayStation 3 will also be on the Xbox 360. Amazetatsuma corrects me and says, Microsoft

37:25.040 --> 37:30.120
did Gears 2 was announced at Game Developers Conference. So, it is not unheard of for games

37:30.120 --> 37:35.320
to be announced at E3. Yeah, because they're talking about the enhancements to Unreal 3,

37:35.320 --> 37:39.520
that stuff. You might hear something about Unreal 4, maybe, I don't know, that might

37:39.520 --> 37:46.240
be interesting. That could be. Maybe some stuff from id from about Doom 4, because I

37:46.240 --> 37:50.480
think they're going to be talking about that and probably rage a little bit. What was I

37:50.480 --> 37:57.200
going to say, though, yeah, the whole rumor thing about, like, Final Fantasy Versus, Square

37:57.200 --> 38:01.840
has kind of already done that with Xbox 360. If you notice, the last few games that they

38:01.840 --> 38:08.000
put out have been only on Xbox 360, and have been exclusive. Star Ocean, Last Hope, The

38:08.000 --> 38:16.000
Last Remnant, before that, oh gosh, I'm forgetting now, but yeah, a lot of their RPGs are going

38:16.000 --> 38:21.200
to be, you know, strictly on the Xbox 360, but now they're going to start getting some

38:21.200 --> 38:23.600
PS3 ones. Infinite Undiscovery, was the other one you were talking about? Yeah, Infinite

38:23.600 --> 38:30.120
Undiscovery, that was what I was thinking. Stuff I did not buy. I don't know, so there's

38:30.120 --> 38:33.080
going to be a lot of companies that are going to be developing for them, because it's easier

38:33.080 --> 38:39.080
to develop on that platform, unless Sony figures out a way to educate these guys a lot faster

38:39.080 --> 38:44.000
and figure out how to develop for a lot easier, you know, that's going to be the problems

38:44.000 --> 38:48.400
they're going to face, and right now, being this far into the console cycle, it's probably

38:48.400 --> 38:52.520
not going to change. So we'll just have to wait for the next round, and we'll see how

38:52.520 --> 38:55.880
it goes there. Alright, well let's keep moving with the news here, because we're running

38:55.880 --> 38:59.040
kind of long tonight, but that's alright, good discussion, right DarkSakura? What else

38:59.040 --> 39:03.640
is new, huh? I know, we're always running long, we're a big fat bloated shell. Hey,

39:03.640 --> 39:07.360
let's talk about some other Xbox 360 releases, but this is actually one for Japan, this is

39:07.360 --> 39:10.360
something that's going to be coming out in Japan. Obviously, Microsoft's had a little

39:10.360 --> 39:13.800
difficulty trying to penetrate the market in Japan, and you know, thanks to some of

39:13.800 --> 39:17.360
these, you know, role playing games that Loki was talking about earlier, they've had a little

39:17.360 --> 39:22.200
bit of luck, but they still have yet to really just break through and be massive over there.

39:22.200 --> 39:27.280
Maybe this will help, because the Japanese love their shmups, shoot em up, shmup. This

39:27.280 --> 39:31.640
one is called Mamoru-kun Has Been Cursed, that would be the English translation of this

39:31.640 --> 39:37.720
title. It is coming out on the Xbox 360, it's going to come with a soundtrack CD and a super

39:37.720 --> 39:42.000
play DVD, that's a limited edition that's coming out on the Xbox 360, coming out for

39:42.000 --> 39:47.920
8500 yen, but if you want the regular edition, it's 5980 yen. Now let me tell you a little

39:47.920 --> 39:52.360
bit about this game here, it's been developed by G-Rev, and apparently it does some type

39:52.360 --> 40:00.320
of, it has character designs in it by Mizuki Takayama, he did some other famous shmup games.

40:00.320 --> 40:04.400
This is actually a translation of an arcade game. Looks like you play a little dude, you're

40:04.400 --> 40:07.760
not actually a ship, but it looks like you're actually a little person that's walking around

40:07.760 --> 40:12.560
kind of doing the fighting, so kind of interesting. It's about an elementary school student who

40:12.560 --> 40:18.000
finds themselves in a nightmarish underworld, so it definitely looks kind of cool. The interesting

40:18.000 --> 40:21.620
thing though about these shmups, they don't translate well for widescreen systems, because

40:21.620 --> 40:26.080
you know, shmups are usually very vertical-oriented, you can't really turn your TV on its side,

40:26.080 --> 40:29.080
so you only end up using a very small portion of the screen. You can if you have a really

40:29.080 --> 40:34.240
kick-ass mounting setup. That's true, but people don't usually have that. Well, my husband's

40:34.240 --> 40:40.720
new monitor, the widescreen HDMI, has access to PivotOn, and actually a lot more that you're

40:40.720 --> 40:47.940
finding these days are built to shift position. And I think some of the games, even the Xbox

40:47.940 --> 40:51.840
Live arcade games like Ikaruga I think did support that as well. We have a few Saturn

40:51.840 --> 40:54.880
games that actually will let you do that, I can think Thunderblade, one of the Thunderblade

40:54.880 --> 40:59.880
games will do it. Well, just to give you an idea of some of the other things that G-Rev

40:59.880 --> 41:04.920
has developed, because it's coming out here, they did do some work with Ikaruga and Gradius

41:04.920 --> 41:08.200
5, just so you know. They did some programming and background graphic design for Ikaruga

41:08.200 --> 41:12.920
and same thing for Gradius 5, so they have touched those games, and they've also done

41:12.920 --> 41:18.280
some work with Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker, which is an old school Dreamcast game. So

41:18.280 --> 41:22.320
there you go! This game, a shmup coming out in Japan, no word if it's coming out over

41:22.320 --> 41:27.280
here, although I gotta be honest, probably not. Well, how about we shift gears a little

41:27.280 --> 41:35.360
bit? Ah ha ha! Cause it's Gears of War 2 patches! Isn't that fun, Rob? Cool! Well, there's going

41:35.360 --> 41:40.840
to be a premium map pack called Snowblind that's coming out on March 31st, and it'll

41:40.840 --> 41:48.400
have three new maps and a remake of Fuel Depot from the first Gears of War, and it's supposed

41:48.400 --> 41:53.880
to bring in experience-based ranking and rebalance the gameplay a bit more, try to give everyone

41:53.880 --> 42:00.120
a better sense of progression, and you'll still be using the true skill system, but

42:00.120 --> 42:06.720
it's sort of background now. It's really just something to make people feel more, you know,

42:06.720 --> 42:13.320
rewarded for how well they do. So you can earn your experience in matches that will

42:13.320 --> 42:19.400
get you through 100 levels, you get milestones for, you know, each level, I think, each certain

42:19.400 --> 42:24.480
level that you get, so you get an achievement for it, as well as, of course, the packs.

42:24.480 --> 42:29.960
So there's a possibility of getting another 250 gamer score points. There's an auto-balancing

42:29.960 --> 42:38.320
feature that will put a bot in place if you fall out during mid-match, although you also

42:38.320 --> 42:51.040
get an XP penalty, and it will correct scoring issues. So there's no real price on the map

42:51.040 --> 42:59.800
pack yet, but as comparison, the combustible map pack is 800 Microsoft points. So the maps

42:59.800 --> 43:07.800
that are coming with this, one's called Grindyard, that's a wintery junkyard processing plant

43:07.800 --> 43:15.800
thing. It's supposed to be a spiritual successor to Gridlock. There's Underhill and Courtyard

43:15.800 --> 43:23.000
also, in addition to the Fuel Depot remake. Very nice. And ActDeft approves in our chat

43:23.000 --> 43:27.280
room, Fuel Depot was the best map of the first Gears of War, says ActDeft. That's probably

43:27.280 --> 43:31.080
why they're bringing it back. That's probably why it's coming back for another round, absolutely.

43:31.080 --> 43:35.780
We like it! Okay, here. Yay! And of course people are going to be excited that they can

43:35.780 --> 43:39.560
increase their gamer score by another 250 points. Here goes your E-peen! Well, I just

43:39.560 --> 43:43.840
want to say, my E-peen hit a landmark today. Where's your E-peen at? Just today. I crossed

43:43.840 --> 43:49.840
10,000 gamer score today. Woo-hoo! I don't think I'm even nearly there. I think I'm like

43:49.840 --> 43:54.400
under 1,000 still. That's alright, slow and steady wins the race. Took me a few years

43:54.400 --> 43:58.400
to get here. Slow and steady means Jamie's got other stuff to do. Well, you have to play

43:58.400 --> 44:02.600
games with really easy gamer score too, like DDR, like you get an A on a song, you get

44:02.600 --> 44:08.560
50 points, you know things like this. You have entered a shop, champagne! Exactly. So

44:08.560 --> 44:16.900
apparently, there's a good use for some of your Xbox 360 systems that may be broken.

44:16.900 --> 44:21.600
One use, of course, would be to convert it into a bong, and that's what someone has done,

44:21.600 --> 44:26.720
actually. They have converted their Xbox 360 system into a bong. Obviously, it doesn't

44:26.720 --> 44:33.960
work anymore, and I'm sure it's been gutted, but yes, now it is a bong, and you can smoke

44:33.960 --> 44:39.280
out of it. Awesome. But, of course, you would only smoke tobacco out of it, right? Of course,

44:39.280 --> 44:44.200
because anything else would be illegal. Because, you know, everybody smokes tobacco out of

44:44.200 --> 44:51.560
bongs. Right. Actually, I do know people who actually will do tobacco in a bong, but I

44:51.560 --> 44:55.760
don't do ginseng and other stuff. Is that like a hookah type thing? Yeah, it's pretty

44:55.760 --> 45:02.280
much just a modified hookah, but it's the same difference. But, I'm looking at the picture

45:02.280 --> 45:08.560
of it, and I would do better with that. I mean, would you really want to turn your Xbox

45:08.560 --> 45:13.000
360, of all things, into a bong? I'd be calling it the Xbox 420. Well, to be honest, you wouldn't

45:13.000 --> 45:18.320
have to necessarily have an Xbox 360. You could buy a replacement case, and it's like,

45:18.320 --> 45:22.600
just buy a bong. I mean, seriously, it's not even worth, you know, just setting it up.

45:22.600 --> 45:28.040
Class, you get a hookah. It's like, why bother, you know? Why bother other than, oh, look,

45:28.040 --> 45:31.720
I did that. Okay, great. Now one person's converted their system into a bong, no one

45:31.720 --> 45:36.000
else needs to do it, because it's a waste of time. Alright, alright. Am I the only person

45:36.000 --> 45:41.640
here who's reminded of Dennis Leary? How so? Saying that smoking pot doesn't lead to other

45:41.640 --> 45:48.160
drugs, it leads to carpentry? Perhaps. AcidicVampire in chat says, if you use your

45:48.160 --> 45:54.080
360 as a bong, you will see Yaris. This is possible. This is very possible. Alright,

45:54.080 --> 45:59.820
look, look. Don't turn your 360 into a bong. Get it to work again so that you can get new

45:59.820 --> 46:04.100
games on it. Although this game is not on the 360, but it's a developer that makes a

46:04.100 --> 46:11.680
lot of games for 360. PopCap is giving away a free game. That's right, a free game. It's

46:11.680 --> 46:16.480
actually, I believe, going on right now. It's kind of like a St. Patrick's Day promotion.

46:16.480 --> 46:22.440
It's going to go through March 24th. The game you can get is Big Money. You can get the

46:22.440 --> 46:28.400
game for free on PopCap. So go check it out. Big Money, kind of like the game Poppet, if

46:28.400 --> 46:35.480
you've ever played it with the balloons. You're basically trying to make, you know, like four

46:35.480 --> 46:40.200
of the same color that touch, and it has a money theme going to it, yeah. It's just like

46:40.200 --> 46:43.120
the balloon game if you've ever played it, but kind of like, oh no, don't you click them

46:43.120 --> 46:47.120
away in this one. When you see matches of four, you click on it, and then they go away

46:47.120 --> 46:50.680
and everything compresses together. I think that's this one. That's how the balloon one

46:50.680 --> 46:56.440
is. So there it is. You click on them, and then it compresses together, and you don't

46:56.440 --> 46:59.640
want it to go past the top of the screen. I've played this before, like a long time

46:59.640 --> 47:03.680
ago, but it's free, so now I can go play it again, unlimited, but I have to get it before

47:03.680 --> 47:10.720
the 24th. So check it out. And as Zach Def says in chat, Big Money, Big Money, no whammies,

47:10.720 --> 47:17.560
stop! No, it's not that kind of big money, sorry to say. Maybe someday on one of those

47:17.560 --> 47:21.440
live. You need to play your gift. I want to get people over and play the pressure. It'll

47:21.440 --> 47:25.280
be fun. I have the Press Your Luck DVD game. That's what Dark Sakura's talking about. It'll

47:25.280 --> 47:30.160
be fun. Alright. How about some release dates? How about it, Rob? Let's start in the UK with

47:30.160 --> 47:36.600
Dark Sakura. Well, there's really, um, most of them are on the 20th. There is a game being

47:36.600 --> 47:43.140
released on the 18th, which is The Path on PC, which I know nothing about. Um, then there's

47:43.140 --> 47:48.600
some stuff on the 20th. As I said, there's Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on DS, Mad

47:48.600 --> 47:55.600
World on Wii, which is beautiful and completely bloodlicious. There's Ready to Rumble Revolution

47:55.600 --> 48:01.520
on Wii, Rhapsody a musical- didn't Rhapsody already come out? I don't know. No, Rhapsody

48:01.520 --> 48:10.200
a musical adventure on DS, The Last Remnant on PC, The Wheelman on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation

48:10.200 --> 48:17.000
3. And that's it. The US doesn't have much coming out, unfortunately, this week. Starting

48:17.000 --> 48:22.560
things off, of course, we have, um, you know, on the DS, and I think this is held over from

48:22.560 --> 48:28.100
last week, but World Championship Games, a track and field event, um, it got delayed

48:28.100 --> 48:35.360
to, um, Monday. And that's on the DS, also Valkyrie Profile coming in the plume, also

48:35.360 --> 48:41.440
coming out on Monday on the DS. Um, Tuesday is when we have most of the stuff coming out,

48:41.440 --> 48:47.520
including, um, another DS game, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Also on the DS, Henry

48:47.520 --> 48:52.720
Hatsworth in a Puzzling Adventure, which is pretty cool, kind of combines puzzle and platforming

48:52.720 --> 49:00.520
there. Um, also on the DS, Mind, Body, and Soul Big World Puzzle Book. Um, on another

49:00.520 --> 49:06.720
Nintendo platform, on the Wii, we have Ready the Rumble Revolution, also Provolution Soccer

49:06.720 --> 49:17.160
2009 on the Wii as well. Um, also have Rune Factory Frontier, and some more DS titles.

49:17.160 --> 49:26.120
We have on the DS and PSP Scrabble, on PlayStation 2, Sing Star Queen, also on the DS, Suicoden

49:26.120 --> 49:37.360
T-Crease, um, Trackmania DS, also on the DS, and on the Wii, Crayola Adventures Colorful

49:37.360 --> 49:46.360
World. Wow, that sounds awesome. Not. Awesomely bad. Awesomely bad, yes. Um, let's see, this

49:46.360 --> 49:52.580
week on Xbox Live Arcade, we're supposed to be getting Hasbro Family Game Night, also

49:52.580 --> 50:02.040
on DS, SBK08, Superbike World Championship. On PC, a few things, The Path, Runes of Magic,

50:02.040 --> 50:12.320
Grand Ages Rome, Ether Saga Online, Tom Clancy's Hawks, and Woman's Murder Club, A Darker Shade

50:12.320 --> 50:19.320
of Grey, oh, and Men of War. That's it, pretty kind of lame release week, but, oh, and on

50:19.320 --> 50:24.480
PSP, how could I forget this, I was actually going to play this, Resistance Retribution.

50:24.480 --> 50:27.520
Can't wait to check out the, like, linking stuff on that. Actually, I can't wait to finish

50:27.520 --> 50:31.640
Resistance 2, since I haven't really played much of that. Hey, quick question for you,

50:31.640 --> 50:34.480
completely random, but since you know about, you know, games that are in demand and all

50:34.480 --> 50:38.840
that stuff, um, what's up with the Retro Game Challenge? I tried to go to Best Buy to get

50:38.840 --> 50:41.880
it the other day, and they said they had none in stock, and they weren't expecting any more.

50:41.880 --> 50:46.760
Is this, is this like a hard to find game now? I guess. It's Atlas, so Atlas puts out

50:46.760 --> 50:51.320
their games in very limited quantities, and a lot of these places, you know, think it's

50:51.320 --> 50:55.820
going to be too niche of a title, and so they don't bring it in. And then people start asking

50:55.820 --> 51:01.160
for it, and then you can't find it. Interesting. I know, because I actually was hearing Bobby

51:01.160 --> 51:03.960
say good things about it last week, and he's not the only one, so my other friends are

51:03.960 --> 51:06.420
talking about how they enjoyed Retro Game Challenge, so I was actually going to pick

51:06.420 --> 51:11.360
it up on the DS, and then I can't find it. Oh well. I'll just get it on Amazon or something,

51:11.360 --> 51:15.920
I guess, if I have to. Alright, let's go over to Japanese release dates, and actually also

51:15.920 --> 51:22.680
Slow Week in Japan. On the Xbox 360, nothing. On the Playstation 3, MLB 09 The Show is coming

51:22.680 --> 51:28.600
out in other Asian regions, not just Japan. It's kind of making an Asia release, so otherwise

51:28.600 --> 51:34.080
as far as Japanese only games, nothing. How about the Nintendo Wii? Now you get some stuff

51:34.080 --> 51:40.040
for Japan. Darts Wii Deluxe, Monopoly Here and Now the World Edition, Tiger Woods PGA

51:40.040 --> 51:44.480
Tour 09 All Play, and Winter Sports 2009 The Next Challenge, all of those titles coming

51:44.480 --> 51:49.640
out on the 19th of March. Checking the handhelds out, actually first I want to mention on the

51:49.640 --> 51:56.200
Playstation 2, there's a couple price reductions on the games Naraku no Shiro and Sankokushi

51:56.200 --> 52:04.080
X get price reductions on the Playstation 2. As far as the Nintendo DS goes, Dengeki

52:04.080 --> 52:11.020
Gakuken Cross of Venus RPG is coming out on March 19th, as well as Gardening Mama makes

52:11.020 --> 52:17.000
its Japanese debut on March 19th. Are you interested in Gardening Mama, Dark Sakura?

52:17.000 --> 52:20.440
Because I knew you were a big fan of a Cookie Mama. I would rather just cook it and have

52:20.440 --> 52:28.240
someone else do my gardening for me. Let's see, also coming out, Kuroshitsuji Phantom

52:28.240 --> 52:35.000
and Ghost comes out from Squeenix on the 19th of March, and the Pets series also making

52:35.000 --> 52:40.440
its way to Japan. Cats, Dogs, Horses and Monkeys, those are all separate games making their

52:40.440 --> 52:46.500
release in Japan. Zookeeper gets a price reduction, that game's been out forever. You finally

52:46.500 --> 52:49.800
get that in Japan. Let's take a quick look at the PSP, see if there's anything I want

52:49.800 --> 52:56.000
to mention on the PSP. Yeah, Dragon Ball Evolution comes out on the PSP this week in Japan. Yeah,

52:56.000 --> 53:02.600
that's gonna suck. A game based on live action Dragon Ball Z, well, Dragon Ball movie. I

53:02.600 --> 53:07.840
don't make them, I just report them. Not gonna see it. You can get PSPs now in bright yellow

53:07.840 --> 53:12.040
and what they call Spirited Green. Those are some new things that are coming out this week

53:12.040 --> 53:17.280
as well. Those actually look pretty hot. Are the PSPs region free? Yes. That green one's

53:17.280 --> 53:23.080
really good looking actually. I wouldn't mind one of those. They're region free as far as

53:23.080 --> 53:29.160
games go, not UMDs. Although, if you put a custom firmware on there, that's not an issue,

53:29.160 --> 53:37.560
so. Tempting. Yes. That's it for release dates. So, let's go back into the gaming news, Dark

53:37.560 --> 53:44.740
Sakura. Well, you know, Amazon's been having a new deal now with their game downloads where

53:44.740 --> 53:54.520
you can basically buy a game to download for $9.99 or less according to their ad. And a

53:54.520 --> 54:00.760
bunch of game developers are not happy about it because they think that their games should

54:00.760 --> 54:07.740
be sold for more. So, PopCap and iWin actually pulled a lot of their games off of Amazon

54:07.740 --> 54:15.220
saying that it was completely unacceptable. For example, they'd want to put like Jewel

54:15.220 --> 54:22.520
Quest for $19.99 and think that $9.99 is way, way too low. That 20 bucks is an acceptable

54:22.520 --> 54:28.720
price, 10 bucks is not. So, you can't get those anymore and from what I understand,

54:28.720 --> 54:39.040
the rest of the selection is kind of ass. Interesting. Hmm. Oh well. There's a pretty

54:39.040 --> 54:49.960
cool update, I guess, possibly in the, I guess, rumored future here for Burnout Paradise.

54:49.960 --> 54:56.640
Now you may remember, I think at CES they were showing off a little bit of the 3D technology

54:56.640 --> 55:02.360
you know with those special glasses that you can wear and stuff like that. That can be

55:02.360 --> 55:07.360
used in say different computer games. I believe they're also showing some of the PS3 games

55:07.360 --> 55:13.040
off in it as well like Wipeout HD and stuff like that. Well, one game that may get this

55:13.040 --> 55:20.120
upgrade in the future, and this might be something we'll see at GDC, would be Burnout Paradise.

55:20.120 --> 55:24.980
And of course, Burnout Paradise, I mean, I love all the upgrades and updates that they're

55:24.980 --> 55:31.600
doing to it. It's really awesome. So, adding 3D to it would be pretty awesome as well.

55:31.600 --> 55:36.120
And if only they could use those polarized glasses that they hand out in the 3D movies

55:36.120 --> 55:39.160
and stuff, because I have a few pairs of those sitting at home. Aren't you supposed to return

55:39.160 --> 55:44.140
those as you leave the theater? You don't have to. The fancy IMAX ones you do. Let me

55:44.140 --> 55:47.780
put it this way. Well, the fancy IMAX ones I can understand because they're like shutter

55:47.780 --> 55:51.340
glasses and stuff like that, but the polarized glasses, they can go fuck themselves because

55:51.340 --> 55:56.640
I have to pay for those glasses. I'm keeping that shit, okay? I can understand that. So,

55:56.640 --> 56:00.320
you know, I'm not recycling crap because they're just going to put that back in a package and

56:00.320 --> 56:06.400
sell it to me again. No, screw it. Not to say that you can't take the glasses out of

56:06.400 --> 56:09.480
Disneyland either because they have the Honey I Shrunk the Audience or whatever. You can

56:09.480 --> 56:12.600
get the 3D glasses for that. No, they actually have a cast member waiting there for you to

56:12.600 --> 56:17.480
dump them off. That's fine. But the Muppet show one's freaking awesome. But I'm saying,

56:17.480 --> 56:21.320
you know, if I have to pay for the glasses, like they're like, oh, the glasses are an

56:21.320 --> 56:28.920
extra $5, I'm keeping the glasses. That I can understand. So, all right. Well, I guess

56:28.920 --> 56:33.120
kind of changing topics here a little bit. Talking about this story out of the UK, there's

56:33.120 --> 56:38.960
this campaign called the Change for Life campaign over in the UK. What's interesting about this

56:38.960 --> 56:44.060
is it's trying to, I guess you could say it's a campaign, an ad campaign trying to get folks

56:44.060 --> 56:51.520
to not play video games, basically insinuating that video games cause obesity, diabetes,

56:51.520 --> 56:56.440
cancer and so on and so on. Just all these bad things. And basically trying to get people

56:56.440 --> 57:00.660
to go out and about. For instance, let me read the text on one of their ads here. Risk

57:00.660 --> 57:06.240
an early death. Do nothing. 9 out of 10 kids risk growing up to have unhealthy amounts

57:06.240 --> 57:10.080
of fat in their bodies. Even if you think they look healthy today, adult could bring

57:10.080 --> 57:14.400
an early death from heart disease, type 2 diabetes or cancer. So make sure your kids

57:14.400 --> 57:19.640
are active for an hour a day. Reduce how much fat they eat. For more advice, visit this

57:19.640 --> 57:24.280
website. And what's interesting about this particular ad that I'm reading from in particular

57:24.280 --> 57:28.560
is it features a little kid sitting on the couch holding a PlayStation controller in

57:28.560 --> 57:33.520
their hand. Like, oh, I'm just sitting here lazy looking, you know, half dead. Yeah. Well,

57:33.520 --> 57:38.440
but he definitely looks bored playing PlayStation games, which, you know, there, there are quite

57:38.440 --> 57:42.120
a lot of boring PlayStation 3 games are out right now. However, that's not the problem.

57:42.120 --> 57:47.220
What's going on here. Sony's pissed about this. And Sony is to the point where, um,

57:47.220 --> 57:52.820
they are actually thinking about possibly filing a lawsuit. Apparently the agency who

57:52.820 --> 57:58.880
made the ad, the gate, they did not get permission from Sony to use the controller, uh, in the

57:58.880 --> 58:05.680
ad. And so it is possible that they're talking about, uh, uh, possibly Sony Computer Entertainment

58:05.680 --> 58:09.720
Europe is considering legal action against the folks that made the ad.

58:09.720 --> 58:15.040
And here's the thing, you know, yes, kids need to get up off the couch. Kids should

58:15.040 --> 58:21.240
not sit and play video games all day. What's there to say that video games aren't actually

58:21.240 --> 58:26.280
a healthy thing to incorporate into a lifestyle, you know, just, you know, maybe an hour a

58:26.280 --> 58:30.800
day or a couple hours a week. You know, if you limit it in your kid's life, I don't think

58:30.800 --> 58:36.000
it's necessarily such a bad thing at all. You know, right. Kind of gets them to think

58:36.000 --> 58:39.840
it challenges them, gives them a sense of accomplishment. I think there's a lot of good

58:39.840 --> 58:44.320
things, you know, the old hand-eye coordination riff that we all used growing up. Right. I

58:44.320 --> 58:48.680
do still think though that kids need to go outside and play. Oh, I absolutely don't get

58:48.680 --> 58:55.040
me wrong, but come on, look at this ad risk and early death sitting here playing. I'd

58:55.040 --> 58:56.040
be pissed.

58:56.040 --> 59:00.880
I'd be as uninteresting as this kid. They're also though not factoring in the fact that

59:00.880 --> 59:05.440
there are many people who may be clinically overweight who are actually in better health

59:05.440 --> 59:12.200
than, like say that you've got the person who's in their BMI range, correct? Right.

59:12.200 --> 59:19.280
And they don't eat properly, they don't exercise, they can't lift much, but you've got the person

59:19.280 --> 59:24.240
that maybe you say a little over their BMI, which by the way, BMI is bullshit, you know,

59:24.240 --> 59:30.120
are overweight, but yet they go out and, you know, bike, go swimming, do things, are active

59:30.120 --> 59:35.280
people and have much better cardiovascular system than the, you know, stupid little anorexic

59:35.280 --> 59:42.320
cheerleader type. I mean, you can also have, you know, someone incredibly muscle bound

59:42.320 --> 59:49.360
who's the same BMI as someone 300 pounds overweight. I mean, really, it's, you've got to look at

59:49.360 --> 59:56.360
the factors of biology, genetics, and more than that. It's, just sitting in front of

59:56.360 --> 59:59.600
the couch playing video games all day is not going to make you die.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.520
Comments from chat. I have to read chat.orangelaundryradio.com. Xlink says, it's good hand-eye, but so is

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.360
masturbation. Good point.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:11.640
SHJ100Matt says, go outside and play Dragon's Lair in the backyard. Xbandit says, you can

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:16.360
be fat and happy. It's true, you can be fat and happy, but you know, you just got to make

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.560
sure you're not fat and unhealthy. There's, there's the difference.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:25.460
You know, so you can be a triathlete and, you know, or let's see, you can be a professional

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:33.840
bicyclist and get cancer. True. True. You can be a triathlete who gets hit by a car.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:39.480
You know, what does it matter? Then you die an ironic death. Here's the thing is that

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.100
I think a better ad might be instead of the big text up there that says risk an early

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:50.440
death, do just nothing. How about one that says stop using games to babysit your children?

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:54.520
That would be an effective ad in my opinion. That, that would be one because the kid looks

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.280
bored and everything. So how about stop using games to babysit your children?

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:06.880
A responsible parent is going to look beyond, you know, there, and this is something that

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.280
I've had to think of a lot myself lately. If you're going to be a responsible parent,

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:19.640
you need to be 100% for your kid, including taking them outside to get them some activity,

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.880
including telling them, you know, I think you've played enough. You need to go do this

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:29.560
now. You've got to set, you know, the, uh, you have to do the things that are good for

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.880
them, not just the things that are convenient for you.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.840
That's an awfully nice way to phrase it as a parent is that, you know, I think you've

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:40.760
played enough cause I know my mom would have said, turn it off and go outside.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.320
Well, you know what I mean?

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.080
No, I know what you mean.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.480
My mom would be just like, you're not on that thing again, are you? And then I'd go out

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.320
and play, come back and she'd be playing my Nintendo.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:59.000
Nice. That's how she got her turn. Go outside. It's my turn.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.440
That's pretty much it.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.840
All right, so we'll see what happens. We'll see if Sony does end up suing over this or

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.680
not. I'm not sure what's going to end up happening.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680
You know who else will sue?

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.680
Who?

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:15.480
They won't, but speaking of Sony, we have some stuff about nobi nobi boy, um, Takahashi

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:22.720
Keita said that there's going to be an offline multiplayer mode on the way and that he wants

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:29.000
people to enjoy the game. So they're working on an update. Um, there's, uh, it's, it's

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:36.820
all going to be though offline though, specifically offline and, um, they're saying that it should

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.720
be roughly around the 18th of April.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.000
Well, I mean, not boo. I mean, multiplayer is better than none at all, but you know,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.960
I wish, you know, it's not like the Sony's not connected to the internet, you know?

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.660
I know, right?

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:48.660
So whatever.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:55.500
Hmm. I don't know. I played that, like I said today, and I still don't get the game.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.960
I have yet to check it out. I keep forgetting. And every time I do go on the PlayStation

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.760
to play, I'm going back to Flower.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.680
I hate the camera so bad in the game.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.480
The Sony camera? Oh, for Flower?

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:14.720
No, in No We Know You. The camera is a pain in the ass. And whatever. Um, so, it's interesting.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.160
Um, of course, a lot of people are familiar with GamePro, the magazine. Um, it's still

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.420
around, surprisingly. Um, well, GamePro is actually going to publish indie games now

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:29.300
under their new label, GamePro Labs. And, uh, you may see some of these games coming

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:38.040
to XNA, PC, Zune, iPhone, etc. Um, basically, they're going to sort of act as a middleman

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.520
between indie devs and platform holders.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.640
Um, what's also interesting is GamePro is going to announce that they're planning to

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:51.060
produce a free custom edition of its magazine for distribution exclusively at 7-Eleven.

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:59.100
So when you get your Slurpee, you can get a free copy of your modified GamePro magazine.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.780
Is this going to be in addition to their print- the current subscription magazine?

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.100
Yes, and also, I'd like to add growing in this economy.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:11.620
I'd like to add as a further dip at, um, the crap that is 7-Eleven. You can go pick up

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:16.460
your free magazine when you're picking up a game that's broken the street again, you

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.860
know, because 7-Eleven doesn't-

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.500
You make it sound like it's an issue.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:24.560
7-Eleven doesn't hear street dates, nor do I.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.020
I know, what's the problem? I thought you were in full support of this.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:33.260
I'm in full support of Slurpees, and if- God damn it, if I became rich, I'm getting a

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.260
Slurpee machine.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:37.940
I miss vanilla Coke Slurpees. Those were the bomb. What the hell do I have to do to get

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.860
those to come back?

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:43.780
GamePro doing their own game publishing. Do you think we're going to see anything big

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.780
come out of this?

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.780
Nope.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.400
Or do you think it's just going to be of the caliber of the types of things that come free

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.140
with the magazine?

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:55.260
You know, that would be kind of interesting to have exclusive games for the magazine,

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.260
you know, just indie developers.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:00.220
I know, I'm surprised these Xbox magazines aren't giving away some of these community

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.360
games on their discs.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:08.740
That's because they have to give away demos that are already available on Live. Woo! Demos!

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:09.740
I can't download-

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.740
For those three people that are connected to the internet.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:16.140
See, here's the thing. I used to subscribe to Xbox Magazine back when they used to have

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:20.180
demos, way before they ever came out, you know, like Saints Row, because that was awesome.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:27.220
Saints Row demo, hell yeah, but now it's like demos for old shit that have been out on Live

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.780
for a long time now.

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:32.300
Yeah, no thanks, I don't need to subscribe to your magazine anymore. I already get a

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:38.780
free membership to stupid, well not even technically free, but I get a membership to Game Informer

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:42.980
because I have that stupid card at GameStop because, you know, it gives me an extra 10%

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:43.980
or whatever.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:47.820
Who cares? It's paid for itself, but hey, I get a magazine out of it, and actually the

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:51.700
magazine's not bad, so I'm not buying Xbox Magazine.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:56.780
Well, if you've ever wanted to make your own iPhone game, as a lot of people have been

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.900
lately, I think the iPhone passed some obscene amount of applications that are now available

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.660
in the store, like 10,000 apps or something are now available in the store.

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.940
How many of them are good?

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:09.620
Probably 10. But anyhow, here's the thing, is that now any idiot's going to be able to

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:15.980
make their own iPhone game. It's a game called GameSalad. Yes, that's right, it's GameSalad,

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:20.020
it's this new software that's coming out from Gendai Games. It's going to be something that

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.900
will help you develop your own iPhone games.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:25.700
Apparently though, it's not just going to stop there. I guess in the future, what have

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:31.540
you, it's going to be open to Facebook, and then possibly the Wii and the DS someday.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:35.440
So yeah, GameSalad is coming out of this, I guess they were showing more about this

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.020
at the South by Southwest festival that's going on right now this weekend. Kind of interesting,

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:43.180
you make your own little 2D games, these screenshots I'm looking at, somebody's putting together

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.420
their own little shooter game. I don't know though, is this just going to be the quality

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.340
of RPG Maker, or what? I don't know.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:55.700
Don't knock RPG Maker, it's still pretty good actually. But no, it's not going to be any

01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:02.160
good at all. I mean, RPG Maker's pretty awesome, but I've seen some of these games, like how

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:08.500
like Click and Play, there's just so many limitations to it, and I don't know, I think

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.500
it's just-

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.040
Well, here's the thing though, it's not just for shooters, like some of the games they

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.420
say have been made on this that are pretty good. A game called Darkwood that's like a

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:23.660
Zelda-ish type of RPG that was made by 3 students in a week's time, and then DRFT, a 2D racing

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.780
game that's kind of like the original Grand Theft Auto.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:29.460
Yeah, it sounds like everything that Click and Play could have done, because that's the

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:34.000
type of stuff you could do in it, and it's just very limited, and yeah, you can make

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.620
these wonderful little racing games and stuff, but they're just not great. And I hope to

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:43.140
God that you can't publish these on the Apple Store, because that's all they want. Let's

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:47.340
put out a game-making program so any idiot can create all this crap and then we can pad

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:52.540
our numbers on the App Store and use that in our next commercial that, you know-

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:57.060
Why not? Any idiot can make a podcast and get it listed on the iTunes Store. Hey, how

01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.060
you doing?

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:04.340
Yeah, but iTunes doesn't go, hey, we've got X million podcasts, look at us, we're so awesome.

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.300
They don't really care.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.660
Apple doesn't care about podcasts?

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:15.460
Apple doesn't care about a lot of things except getting you to buy their crappy products.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:20.380
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news. We're almost to the end of part A of

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.620
the Classic Game of the Week, coming up in just a little bit, we've got a couple more

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.020
stories for you guys.

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:31.580
That we do. In fact, something about Resident Evil 5. There's supposed to be a versus download

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:44.340
content and it's supposed to be out for 160 Microsoft points or 250 yen on a Playstation

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:50.260
network, which we're probably going to be getting it for twice as much or something

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:57.980
like that, but they're basically saying in Japan it's going to be out March 26th, so.

01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:06.220
Very cool. So there's, of course, we were talking a little bit earlier about exclusives

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:12.260
and that kind of stuff and mentioned Bioshock 2. Well, of course, this month in Game Informer,

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:18.300
which also goes back to another story, man, we're transitioning from two different stories.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:26.020
Bioshock 2 was the cover story and, of course, they showed, or revealed, I should say, the

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:34.100
Big Sister is a new Big Daddy-esque creature that you're going to be fighting against in

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:39.340
the game. Now, there are no real details, at least, that have leaked out yet about what

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:45.700
exactly you're going to be doing, but the second game, apparently, you will be playing

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:51.660
as the first Big Daddy, the original. They'll be kind of a renegade Big Daddy that's actually

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:57.900
on the hunt for his own little sister and that you'll be able to take out rival daddies

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:03.620
with your hand drill. Plasmid powers, apparently, are going to be making a return as well as

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:10.380
some other interesting things. And, apparently, this little sister is looking to kidnap your

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:16.500
little sisters as well. And it's very interesting, but, of course, it's going to be an awesome

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:27.900
game. Bioshock 1 was really sweet and I can't see that it's going to be any less than that.

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:31.300
This game has an awful lot to live up to. Do you think it's going to meet the hype?

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.220
I think it will. I think they're going to have to do some interesting stuff with it.

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.740
I thought that it was going to be more above ground and stuff like that. The fact that

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:43.420
you're playing as a Big Daddy from the beginning is kind of ehhh. I'm not too sure if I like

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:52.460
that idea, but we'll see. Alright, well, hey, let's take a trip back to the past here. I'm

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.740
not talking about the Classic Game of the Week just yet, but here's the interesting

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:59.940
thing is that the Genesis, of course, is a system that's been featured many times in

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:06.100
the Classic Game of the Week. Apparently, there is this new kind of like third party

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:11.860
Sega Genesis coming out here. Blaze is the company that is producing this. I guess it's

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:15.780
kind of like a knockoff of the Genesis that came out kind of later. They're calling it

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.500
the Mega Drive because I don't think they're actually releasing it here. It's something

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:25.700
that is being sold at Play in Britain. It's going for about $53 and with the system comes

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:32.240
about 15 games. Sonic and Knuckles, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd, Golden Axe. So all these

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.960
old school games. And I guess what you start to see is as these consoles age, I guess the

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.180
patents expire or something like that. And now third party remake these old ass consoles,

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:45.700
which is interesting. And the best part about this though, because they did release something

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.780
before they've done handhelds and that kind of thing. The best part about this though

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:54.740
is it does have its own cartridge slot that will play Mega Drive and Genesis games. So

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:58.660
not only do you have the 15 that are built in, but you can put in new ones. Yeah. Very

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:04.680
cool. Very cool. Alright, well, now what we're going to do, we're going to take a trip back

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:08.420
to the past and I don't know if Dark Soccer has picked a Genesis game this week. She might

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:13.820
have picked something else. Not a while. Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane and see

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:18.460
what the classic game of the week is that all you kids should check out this week by

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:27.460
Dark Soccer. Well, the secret, the secret. The game of the week is Secret of Mana, which

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:35.900
was known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2. And I picked music for it that is actually some

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:46.900
of the overworld music, which is my favorite. Well, I thought it was going to be a little

01:12:46.900 --> 01:13:03.460
different. The game came out, it was actually developed by Square, which is now Squeenix,

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:11.180
and came out on the Super Nintendo and we eventually got it on Virtual Console. It's

01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:16.420
actually, as I said, Seiken Densetsu 2. The first one was called Seiken Densetsu Final

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:25.180
Fantasy Gaiden for the Game Boy, and we got it as Final Fantasy Adventure. It was kind

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:31.060
of an interesting little game there, but going back to Secret of Mana, it didn't use the

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:39.220
turn based system, it used a real time battle, more like how it was in Zelda, but you also

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:47.700
had an AI that you could actually control to be either attacking, defense, or somewhere

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:53.660
in the middle, and a second player could come in and play one of your other characters.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:59.820
So it was pretty much a two player RPG. I personally have not tried to do it with the

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:05.300
multitap to see if you can do three people, so if anyone has let me know. It just never

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:18.740
occurred to me until I was an adult. So the game itself, in the American version, is basically,

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:24.060
you're kicked out of town and you have to go and you hook up with a princess and a sprite

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:31.320
and you run around trying to get a different, well first of all you get your experience

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:39.420
in battle and you level up and you can level up your spells as you, you know, as you attract

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:44.140
them. And by the way, the multitap does work. Thought I would mention that. And the virtual

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:49.800
console version will let you use three people. But anyway, you have to rescue different elementals

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:57.780
and they give you different attacks, different skills, different things that you can do.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:08.620
But the magic is your party's mana power which will increase as the game goes on. So, really

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:15.020
it's just you go through different places. You can also get Flammie. You remember Flammie?

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:18.940
Yes. The second thing I put on there, Rob, was

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:22.260
Flammie's music. Let me queue that up here real quick.

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:36.580
The best way I can describe Flammie is like Falcor from The Never Ending Story, really.

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:41.940
It's the same concept. You ride on this big white dragon thingy's back and then you can

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:52.300
land in different places. But hey, it's mode seven-tastic. So you can go over the background

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:57.900
and you can move and the map will move with you and you can land and it's pretty cool.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:02.580
So it's just a cool little game. I think it's funny though, the way that you call them is

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:09.860
by doing the little drum with the balls on the string. I forgot what they're called.

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:19.620
But anyway, it's super cool. But at the end you get the mana sword and kick ass and game

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:35.300
over. So the game was designed by Ishikoichi and was actually released after Final Fantasy

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:44.500
3. They wanted to actually use the system from Final Fantasy 4, but it wouldn't work

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:49.180
in the series, so they did it all for Secret of Mana. It was originally going to be an

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:55.740
SNES CD add-on, but when they dropped that they just did it all to fit on the cartridge.

01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:04.660
I actually had one of the faster localization. It only took 30 days to translate the game.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:15.580
And we got it. It was also stated that they were going to bring it out for the Wonderswan

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:29.580
Color and they cancelled it when Square decided to tell Bondi WTF, we don't like you anymore.

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:35.780
So that's really it. It's been one of the most popular games. It's been considered by

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:42.540
Nintendo Power it was number 42 in their top 200 games of all time. And it's one of my

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:47.500
favorites. And it's actually because of this that I went nuts trying to find Saikens and

01:17:47.500 --> 01:18:00.220
Senzu 3 and played the most of it on a fully translated bomb hack. I wish I could find it.

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.220
It's a very worthwhile game. If you haven't played it, play the hell out of it and then

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:11.180
play Saikens and Senzu 3 because it just evolves all the awesome. So go for it. I don't even

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.580
know why I hadn't reviewed this earlier.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:17.980
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Secret of Mana. And what a classic

01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:22.100
game it is. I wonder if they'll ever be highlighting Secret of Evermore.

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:28.060
Well, ow, sorry. You know what gave me the idea to do that, Rob? I found my game.

01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.060
What's that?

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:30.060
Secret of Mana.

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:31.060
Oh, did you?

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.060
In the box.

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.060
Ah.

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:36.940
With the instruction manual and everything. And then I was just thinking, damn. It's a

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:39.500
shame that I'm so attached to this thing.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.500
Nice.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.940
That would pay for my Disneyland.

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:47.100
Right, right. Alright, well we are going to take a break here. We've got plenty more Orange

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:50.740
Lounge Radio coming up, though, in Orange Lounge Radio Part B. So stay tuned. Don't

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:58.940
go anywhere. We will be right back.

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.740
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:10.140
15th of 2009, where we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night on AllGames.com. All Games

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:14.300
Radio, bringing you lots and lots of great gaming shows throughout the week. We're on

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.620
right after another great gaming show called The Bobby Black Wolf Show, and we run for

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:22.700
about three hours, until we're tired and we want to go home, is basically how long we

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:23.900
do the show.

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:27.060
We have plenty more gaming news to get to in this segment. First, though, I want to

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:30.460
kind of give a plug for this. You might remember a few weeks ago, actually it was a couple

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:36.780
months ago now at this point, we had Aaron from the Snake 360 development team, or he

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:42.100
is the Snake 360 development team, really, all by his little self, was here on the show

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:46.100
to talk about his community game, Snake 360. Well, I just got word that now apparently

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:53.680
there is a new game called Snake 360 Lite on Xbox Live Marketplace, and it's the same

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:58.420
game as pretty much what was up there before, except now it's half the price. Now, of course,

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.740
since it is half the price, there's a little less features than what you have in the full

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:07.660
game, but now I guess you get some two different multiplayer modes now, three single player

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:13.420
courses, three difficulty levels, multiples of control schemes, just like in the other

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:17.420
game, you still get some of the soundtrack from the same recording, and so on and so

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:22.620
on. So, pretty cool, check that out, support independent game development, Snake 360 Lite.

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:26.460
Alright, now we're going to get back into some other gaming news, yes, Loki?

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:34.580
Yes, we are. Some pretty cool stuff, I don't know, this is kind of weird. Nintendo has

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:40.700
addressed complaints that they had not that many games coming out, they're low output

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:46.660
of first party titles. Apparently, it says this year, Nintendo seems to be getting some

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:54.700
more games coming out, including the equally awaited Punch Out. Of course, they've been

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:58.380
having the new play control games and stuff like that, but it says until now, there have

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:03.420
been complaints that Nintendo actually makes too many games, or Nintendo dictates too much

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:08.940
leadership. I think they're talking about publishers complaining that their games, the

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:13.260
first party games seem to be so successful, it's actually overshadowing the third party

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:18.300
games, and then also it says that there's also people complaining that Nintendo makes

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:25.260
far too few games. And they're like, well, we don't know what to do. So now that they're

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:28.820
putting out more games, they're trying to make sure people are going to be happy. The

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:35.020
thing though, you ask me, they're not really putting out that many new games. I mean, porting

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:40.540
over a game that was on the GameCube that they had sitting in a shelf for quite a long

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:47.540
time, some of the Mario Tennis and the Pikmin games and the new Donkey Kong, was it Jungle

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:51.900
Beat and that kind of stuff. Those aren't new games. You're just adding stuff to it

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:57.020
and you're adding new controls to it. I mean, really, that does not count. Putting old things

01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:02.860
in new packaging. That doesn't count at all. Excite Bots and Punch Out, that does count

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:07.420
because those are brand new. But these new play control games, I'm sorry, I'm getting

01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:11.740
a little sick of them. And they've just started coming out, but just tell people to stop buying

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:16.460
them. But the thing is, that's all that's coming out now. It's like, people are so hungry

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.860
for Nintendo games, like, oh god, I want a new Pikmin game. Well, now you're going to

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:26.140
buy the re-release of Pikmin 1 and 2. I mean, that's fine if you want to play them or if

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:31.180
you haven't played them before, but it's kind of encouraging them not to put any effort

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:35.100
into it. It's just like, I don't know if you remember back on the Game Boy Advance, when

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:40.940
they started porting NES games to it. You know, that was cool, but at the same time,

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:48.660
it's like, let's make something new now. Anytime now. GameGuru in our chatroom says Punch Out

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:55.180
is very much a remake. It is, but it is adding new characters, and it's not so much, it may

01:22:55.180 --> 01:23:00.080
be a remake, but it's not a port. It's a Super Nintendo game too, and it's at least kind

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:04.020
of redone from the ground up, and there are some new things in it. And it's not a port.

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:08.500
It's not like, oh, I took the GameCube game, didn't really change anything to it, and then

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:14.380
just poured it over. Now, Pikmin 1 and Mario Power Tennis, they didn't really add anything

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:18.860
to it. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, from what I hear, they're adding some additional levels

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:22.420
to it. I don't know if it was in the Japanese version or if these are brand new levels,

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:26.020
but they're adding something to it. And then Pikmin 2 are supposed to have two different

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:30.140
types of Pikmin that weren't originally in the game. So they are adding something to

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:38.820
it. But still, it's a port of a game that's been out for a long time now. GS68 in chat

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:44.660
asks, where's my new play control Custer's Revenge? That wasn't on the GameCube. It wasn't,

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:48.700
but maybe it's a game that he's thinking needs to make a comeback, I don't know. Alright,

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:53.180
well look, if you want to look for some new Wii games that actually look kind of interesting,

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:56.700
and you want to talk about a remake, I don't know if this is really a remake though. This

01:23:56.700 --> 01:24:01.060
is like a reinvention completely of the old game Pong. I'm going to actually play a little

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:06.060
clip here from the little trailer that we have here in studio, because this actually

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:15.380
looks kind of neat. Let me see if I can play a little clip here. It's like a music-based

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:23.900
game. It's called Bit.Trip.Beat, and it's by a company called Axis. And it's actually

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:28.380
coming out to WiiWare on Monday, and it's like, all these little Pong balls consistently

01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.740
are coming at your little paddle, and you have to bounce them back. And when you do,

01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:37.340
it makes little beat music, like the 8-bit weapon type of chiptunes music, that's what

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:41.340
I was looking for. I guess this game's coming out, it's going to be 600 points. Here's the

01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.860
thing, the controls, you just tilt the control back and forth, tilt the little Wiimote back

01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.800
and forth to make the little paddle go up and down the screen. And the graphics, they're

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:55.300
not even 8-bit, they're like Atari 2600, but with these really trippy New Age backgrounds.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:59.260
So it looks kind of neat. I'm actually thinking I have to play this. This should be on the

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:04.540
DS. No, I like the idea of only having to pay $6 for this. But this should be on the

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:10.220
DS. Who knows, maybe if this does well, it will be. But like, this boss stage looks just

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:16.100
like a freakin' regular Breakout or something like that, it's crazy. Trippy. Very trippy.

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:20.980
Hence the name, haha. Exactly, so you can check that out, it'll be out on WiiWare on

01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:25.140
Monday it sounds like. By the time most of you hear this podcast, it'll already be out.

01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:32.140
ActDeft in chat says, BitTripBeat is basically Pong and Rez's bastard child. Kinda. Kinda.

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:42.260
Well, I have bad, bad news. Actually, not really bad news. Hmm, what's that? It's not

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:50.620
likely news, but Capcom US is hoping that we get a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which I think

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:59.300
would be freakin' fantastic. And I mean, it's got Gatchamon. What else do you need, right?

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:04.460
They're saying, it was basically a quote by Christian Svensson, who is the developer,

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:09.180
the business developer and strategic planning VP at Capcom, said, do not rule out, do not

01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:13.300
rule a Western release out. That's all I can say right now. We are still actively working

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:17.300
on having that happening. I can't say it's happening definitely. I couldn't give you

01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:21.580
a time, but as badly as the fans want it, we want to bring it. The problem that they're

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:30.900
running into is, what do we all say, licensing. Right? Mm-hmm. Tatsunoko rights are actually

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:37.380
split among several companies in the US, whereas of course in Japan, Tatsunoko Pro has all

01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:44.300
of them. You don't have to worry about it. But here, it's like, you know, whoever had,

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:49.340
you know, Gatchamon 2 has Eagle Riders here. You know, there was Battle of the Planets,

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:57.500
there was G-Force, you know, for all the Gatchamon franchises. I don't know if we ever got Tekkaban

01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:03.540
on TV here at all. Some anime companies got the rights to Kachan. Yeah, we had it as it

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:09.180
was Technoman over here. But just all those different characters, the ones that were either

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:15.580
converted to, you know, tunes that we watched as a kid or in later anime, you know, home

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:21.060
releases, you know, different things like that. Or even, you know, people who just thought

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:26.580
about bringing it out over here and paid the licensing rights. That does happen. It's gonna

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:32.700
be a pain to get everything together, so they're actually gonna have to do a lot of work for

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:39.820
us to get the game over here, and it's all down to freakin' licensing. Well, that's not

01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:43.020
a surprise, but kinda, you know, I think we all, at least I accepted the fact that we

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:46.400
probably weren't gonna be getting this game quite some time ago. You know, I wouldn't

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.480
expect to see this game over here because of the licensing, which is just a darn shame

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:55.400
because the game's a lot of fun. You almost just kinda wish, you know, if the Japanese

01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:00.340
companies created them, they just would release it out here and say, fuck all y'all. These

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:04.900
were originally our characters, so I forget it. But I guess, sadly, in a sue-happy world,

01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:10.100
that's not what can be done. Well, the way that it is is that once Tatsunoko's given

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:15.100
up the rights, they have to abide by contract. Yeah, no, I get it. It just sucks. And Tatsunoko

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:21.140
Pro I don't think really has any holdings in the US, so it'd be nice. So then they couldn't

01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:25.500
be sued in a US court. But I guess Capcom could be. But Tatsunoko wouldn't legally be

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:30.300
able to give the approval, which they clearly did in Japan, they just would not legally

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:34.700
be able to do approval in the United States. No, I know, I get it. It just sucks. That's

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:40.600
all. It just sucks. Hmm. So. It's still pretty cool though that might have a chance to actually

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.240
come out over here. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't bet money on it. Here's what I would

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.220
bet. If anything, they would just use the engine for something else. You know, like

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:55.380
port, new maybe Capcom vs Street Fighter game. That'd be kinda cool, you know, with some

01:28:55.380 --> 01:29:01.100
new Capcom characters in there and stuff. You know, get a, what's his name, Frank West

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:07.140
from Dead Rising in there and stuff as a character. Sadly, I'm not gonna hold my breath. They'd

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:12.740
need Gatchaman Fighter. Always. Just Gatchaman. Whatever. And they'd need to make it, for

01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:18.060
me specifically, and say, because Jamie demanded it, we give you- And it would actually say

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:25.820
that in the opening credits. Exactly. We give you Gatchaman the battle. Okay. I would be

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:32.580
very gratified as a fangirl. And then you wake up. Yeah, not gonna happen. What is gonna

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:39.220
happen though are three more Wii games in the Resident Evil series, including the, it's

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:44.940
never gonna be released in the United States, Resident Evil 0, which now is gonna be released

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:50.180
in the United States, and of course already out in Japan. However, a new game that will

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:55.380
be coming out, Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles, which will be a sequel to the Umbrella Chronicles

01:29:55.380 --> 01:30:00.660
game. It's gonna be a rail shooter, and is based on the Resident Evil 2 timeline starring

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:07.300
Leon and Claire. They're gonna add, I guess, some new co-op stuff and a new evade system,

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:12.100
which is supposed to be pretty cool. Then they're also gonna do a Resident Evil remake

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:19.340
that's gonna be coming out as well, titled, I guess, Resident Evil Classics. And, not

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:24.100
sure if that's gonna be kinda like a new play control game or something like that, but that's

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:39.740
gonna be, I guess, coming out for a $30 price point. The studio is haunted. We're having

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:52.100
the attack of the random beeping noise. Here, just give that to me. I'll turn that off.

01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:57.220
Live radio, everybody. It's my sensor bar. Batteries are going out. Sorry about that,

01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:00.660
guys. It's warning you that it's turning off. We had random beeping going on in the studio,

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:03.980
and it was from the Wii that Loki was playing during the breaks there, showing Madworld

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.420
on Justintv. The wireless bar was beeping. That was crazy. I think the timer, I had set

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:14.780
it to a two-hour timer, so I think it was turning off. Okay, sorry about the crazy dead

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:21.460
air there, but live radio, that happens. Yeah, so I'm sorry. Resident Evil rail shooter is

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:25.860
coming out. And it makes me think about, you know, Silent Hill had a rail shooter that

01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:29.100
hit arcades and what have you, so it's like all these scary games are getting shooters.

01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:32.660
You know what scary thing I wanna see get turned into a shooter, though? Hot girls in

01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:37.740
scary places. Have you seen this show on E? I thought you were gonna say showgirls. No.

01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:41.940
That is scary in itself, but have you seen this on E? It's a show on E, and they put

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:45.220
hot girls and they put them in scary places, and they have to spend the night in abandoned

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:49.740
hospitals and stuff. What, like, you know, next to nerdy guys or something? No, they

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:52.780
have to do all these gross tasks and they get money and stuff like that, you know, if

01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:57.040
they're able to actually... Hot girls in scary places, yes. That's the game they need that's

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:03.700
a rail shooter of a completely different kind. Alright. Anyhow, forget it. Moving on. More

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:08.700
news on Excitebots. It seems like every week we have new news on Excitebots, but here's

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:14.160
the interesting thing about Excitebots. Apparently now the blogs are reporting that Super Sandwich

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:18.740
is a move that you can have in the game, and that's from this giant screenshot coming from

01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:24.180
the game there. Super Sandwich, five stars. It's basically, what they've done is they've

01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:28.500
have a bunch of different things that are going on during the races, like, you know,

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.660
you'll have to collect parts of a sandwich and then when you collect them you have Super

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:35.500
Sandwich. You know, it was funny, remember? I don't know if you remember when Christopher

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.420
used to, like, kind of sing the different, like, achievements that he got in there. He

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:43.980
was like, Super Tree Run! So that's what I pictured when I saw that. I was, like, picturing

01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:48.340
him singing Super Sandwich. Nice. Which would be funny. Sadly you will not be having an

01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:53.220
actual sandwich, which is most unfortunate if you ask me. The game looks crazy and Nelly

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:58.300
keeps asking me why it's coming out, so. And we don't know, right? Or is it... Uh, 20.

01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:05.300
22nd or 20th of April? Yeah. Oh. Alright. Not too far out. Not too far out. Hey, it's

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:10.780
in time for a birthday present. For me! It's always got to be about you now, doesn't it?

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:19.780
Yes, it always must be about me. I have to have the show's ego after all. Anyway, um,

01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:32.260
how about something related to Namco, maybe? Okay. Well, Namco is actually registered Excalibur

01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:40.860
as a trademark. They're not really saying much about it, but it actually has an ESRB

01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:49.820
listing some achievements revealed. The, like I said, the registered trademark. And so it's

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:56.780
there. Namco Bandai is releasing Excalibur. So, of course the theory is that, you know,

01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:04.300
it's about King Arthur, but maybe it's another in the Soulcalibur family? Or maybe a fighting

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:16.100
game using the same engine? Or a remake of that old game Excalibur 2555 AD? I have a

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:22.300
feeling that whatever it is, it's going to be lame and disappointing. It's going to be

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:26.860
about Pac-Man! Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. No, that's Namco for you. It's either going

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:32.700
to be really awesome or really lame. And it's usually nothing in between, so. I'm voting

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:38.460
really lame. I don't know. Without a screenshot, nothing? I mean, this could be anything. It

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:45.180
could be a role-playing game. Who knows? Nothing. It sounds a little bit like Soulcalibur, but

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:50.340
you know, Excalibur is also an old, you know, legend and all that stuff. It may have nothing

01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:56.020
to do with Soulcalibur. Excalibur is the storyline based on fighters that have dropped out of

01:34:56.020 --> 01:35:01.620
the Soulcalibur series and now have to find real daytime jobs, including working faster

01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:10.740
at restaurants. I get it. Excalibur. Ha ha. You're funny. What a fun guy. Ha ha ha. Or,

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:17.900
or it's a fighting game featuring all the exes in the relationship. Alright, I think

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:24.340
now's a good time to just go to the next story. I'll stop now. We do know what this game is

01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:29.620
though. We Rock Drum King. It's a brand new drumming game for the Wii. Of course, not

01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:34.220
using any actual peripherals other than the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, or possibly two remotes

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:39.060
if you have those. What it does have though is a pretty cool song list. And the track

01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:46.140
list was revealed this week, including some stuff that you would not normally see in a

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:51.940
music game like this. Now of course you've got classic rock songs like We Will Rock You

01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:57.420
by Queen, The Final Countdown by Europe. You've got some kind of alternative stuff,

01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:03.100
Song 2 by Blur. Then some other stuff that they've thrown in there as well. Feel Good

01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:12.040
Ink by Gorillaz. But one of the weird ones though that was in there, they had Organ Donor,

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:16.360
the instrumental version by DJ Shadow. You normally wouldn't see that kind of in like

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:21.980
a rock game like this. Some other songs that are in there as well. They have All Star by

01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:30.540
Smash Mouth. No One Knows by the Queens of the Stone Age. The Takeover, The Break's Over

01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:39.900
by Fall Out Boy. Can't Stand Losing You by the Police. Spoon Man by Soundgarden. And

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:50.260
Click Click Boom by Saliva, as featured in numerous movie trailers. You know, I was still

01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:53.600
tempted to get Rock Revolution this week. It's only 20 bucks. There's tons of them sitting

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.660
on the shelf. I'm almost thinking it's going to drop to $9.99 before too long. It won't

01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:04.380
drop officially to $9.99, but just let's sit there and fester a while and it's eventually

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:11.140
going to drop down. So bad, they actually cancelled the Wii version. Ouch. Ouch. Because

01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:16.380
that was actually supposedly slated for April, still coming out at $50 retail. I'm like,

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:21.620
yeah, no one's gonna buy that. Wow. So, yeah, they just cancelled it. Wow. I wonder if there's

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:26.700
sales figures on how much that game actually sold. Oh, I'm sure there are. In fact, I have

01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:30.820
an idea where to look. Alright, well, while you do that, let me talk about some other

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:35.580
games that aren't necessarily just there to be sold. It's actually kind of neat. This

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:39.900
is over in Japan. There's a Nintendo game seminar program, and if you're a student of

01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:43.800
this, you get to make your own DS game, basically, as a part of the program. Well, Nintendo's

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:48.380
actually taken these games that were created, and now they're available at DS download stations

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:53.340
throughout Japan. And you can also get them through the Wii Nintendo channel. There's

01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:57.500
four games available. One of them is a mic controlled game in which you blow to kind

01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:02.780
of create air that sends stars up in the sky. Another one is where you are a voice artist

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:07.920
that reads lines, and then when they're played back, they're given by like a weird character

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:13.180
on screen, a random one or something. Another one is an action game where you move around

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:17.380
and you pose, but I'm not sure exactly how that's done because they didn't say these

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:22.700
were for the DSi, although, you know, I'm sure these will show up on the DSi, you know,

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:25.880
eventually. Sure, if they can charge like two bucks for them, why not? And then the

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:31.620
last one is a game about making faces. You shape weird things on these heads that don't

01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:35.860
have bodies and etc. So, but it's just kind of cool, you know, despite the fact that the

01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:39.780
games all sound like little one-trick ponies, it's kind of cool that, you know, they have

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:44.740
this program where students can make these games over in Japan and, you know, not just

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:47.540
that, but now they have kind of a way to get it out there. It's almost kind of like a little

01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:52.860
bit XNA-ish, so I don't know if that's something maybe this is a sign that Nintendo might use

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:56.960
the DSi download service for this or some of their other distribution channels, but

01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:03.020
that is kind of an interesting thought, right? Yeah, although it could just be a bunch of

01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:09.400
crapware, I don't know. Okay, I've got the sales figures on Rock Revolution. Alright,

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:16.820
can you source them or...? Yes, these are coming from VGcharts.com, and this is up-to-date

01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:20.740
sales figures. Although they have sales figures for Wii version of Rock Revolution, I guess

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:30.180
it never came out over here, but whatever. 0.5 million copies were sold for the Xbox

01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:36.460
360 version. That is the highest of the three. That's not bad, that's a half million, right?

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:45.540
0.5 million, or 0.05? 0.05 million. Oh, so 50,000. 50,000. And that is the best one out

01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:54.140
of all three versions. The PS3 version sold 0.02 million copies, or 20,000, and then finally

01:39:54.140 --> 01:40:01.900
the DS version only sold 10,000 copies. Youch. Well, that's sad because the DS version seemed

01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:06.500
like the only one that made sense out of the bunch. But whatever. Alright, well thanks

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:09.340
for looking that up for me. Alright, well, now we're going to get to the part of the

01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:14.340
show where you can always send us some questions and have them answered here live on air. It's

01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:18.940
the mailbag segment every week you guys send us emails. Mailbag at orangelauncher.com and

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:22.460
we read our favorites live on air and respond to them. DarkSira, did we actually get some

01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:25.900
emails this week? I know you had to clean out the spam. Amongst the spam, yeah, really.

01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:35.740
Um, we got one from Cheeseburger. Aight. Dongle. It made me giggle. Smack. Inside, in a painful

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:44.380
way. Did we get any emails of substance? Yes. Alright. Um, first of all, this is, it says

01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:50.860
Dear Sea Wow and Wow Bar and Dark Sakura Sky and Loki. So this is a multiple email. First,

01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:57.980
where, um, are my shows and, two, boy do I have a slew of reviews for you. Okay. Alright,

01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:02.060
first, um, Tony Hawk's Project 8, another Tony Hawk title for the PSP, but this time

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:09.260
around it is a bit more challenging. No auto-kick. The story is cheesy as always. But anyways

01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:17.220
it's awesome and if you are a skater, wanna be by this. I'm sorry I really can't read

01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:23.660
this. Yeah, I'm looking at this, it looks like it was written on a PSP. I'm going to

01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:32.380
try. Alright. Okay, I'm, I'm going to translate into English, okay? Will that be fine? Okay,

01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:39.100
Wipeout Pure. A lot of us, uh, kids who own a DS and own a GBA, um, know of F-Zero and

01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:45.460
GX. They have not released anything for a long time and I own a PSP. I thought that

01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:49.940
it would be a good idea. Instead, it was, and I'll tell you it was more of a challenge

01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:56.100
than F-Zero. GTA Liberty City, okay. I know you're thinking what a 15 year old is doing

01:41:56.100 --> 01:42:01.700
with a GTA game. I bought it on Amazon using my debit card and got it a few weeks. I popped

01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:06.300
it in and I instantly love it. The custom soundtrack stuff takes some work, but once

01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:10.980
you do it, it's awesome. Killing police from my safe house with a sniper rifle and racking

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:17.200
up a six star rating is so fun. Definitely recommend it to a first time PSP buyer. Lords

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:21.920
of Dogtown, I love skateboarding and surfing stuff. This movie combined a little bit of

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:29.020
both with a story about Jay Adams, Tony Alva, and Stacy Peralta. Okay. Um, alright, last

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:33.200
thing. I have one question. Have you guys ever heard of Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.500
System or the Neo Geo CD King of Fighters is Better Than Street Fighter? Peace out,

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:44.540
DS lover. Okay. First of all, I own, um, a Neo Geo and I, um, I have a Neo Geo CD as

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:52.100
well and I have, um, a Neo Geo pocket color and a Neo Geo pocket. Um, so I'm really not

01:42:52.100 --> 01:43:00.400
sure which one you're asking about, but King of Fighters, um, it really depends on what

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:04.460
you're into. I love the King of Fighters series. I mean, talk about your cheap bitches and

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:09.060
hard to pull off attacks. I mean, Street Fighter's a little bit more gratifying to play, but

01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:13.500
King of Fighters is just a little bit more, sometimes there's a bit more of a fun factor

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:17.580
involved with the King of Fighters games. And I do have to say that if you've got it

01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:23.420
on the Neo Geo, you've got it arcade perfect and you have also paid for it. So that's all

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:29.640
I can say about that. Rob? Um, you know, yeah, King of Fighters is sort of like an evolution

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:35.100
of, uh, Fatal Fury and King, um, Art of Fighting in those games. And it's, it's okay. Like

01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:39.540
it's not something I really can usually tolerate long-term though, the SNK games, but they

01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:42.740
do have that whole, like, you know, foreground and background thing, which is kind of what

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:47.240
made them famous. But, um, that was just, um, Fatal Fury. I don't, oh, was it just Fatal

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:52.060
Fury? I thought King of Fighters had it too. My bad. Did Art of Fighting have it? No, I

01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.980
think just Fatal Fury. No, Art of Fighting had the weird zoom in and out thing. That

01:43:54.980 --> 01:44:00.540
was our fighting did it too. The first one did at least. So it was Fatal Fury that had

01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:05.660
the background foreground. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, it's, it's, it's different and worth

01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:10.260
the play, but it, I don't think it's necessarily better. Does that make sense? But I love Capcom

01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:14.940
versus SNK. That's one of my favorite fighters right there. So Matt, what's your preference

01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:20.020
Street Fighter or King of Fighting? King of Fighters. Do you have a preference, Loki?

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:25.300
Ron Street Fighter versus King of Fighters? No. You hate them all? Not hate, but I just

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:30.220
don't really care. I will tell you this. Any of the King of Fighters games on Saturn have

01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:43.220
a bitch of a load time. Seriously. In between rounds. Load time. So, next email. Um, hi

01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:47.540
all. I was just wondering if it was possible for you guys to create a widget for Samsung

01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:51.980
phones for your podcast, as I would love to be able to listen to you on the go and download

01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:58.980
your shows wherever I am. Thanks Simil. Um, I've not even heard of the Samsung phones

01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:03.100
widget thing. That's not something I'm familiar with. Send us more information on how to make

01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:06.220
one. If it's just used doing a simple website or something, I'm sure we can figure it out

01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:10.620
if it involves programming like an iPhone application. Well, I don't know so much about

01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:14.780
that. Um, if it's something you can connect to iTunes, I don't know if your phone, I don't

01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:18.980
know because there's a lot of Samsung phones. Um, if your phone, my old phone was a Samsung

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.580
and if it has a memory card, like my old one, you can put your own songs or your own music

01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:26.420
on it basically. Um, you should be able to just sync it up with iTunes and download our

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:31.060
podcast on iTunes and do it that way. That's the best thing I can think of. If all fails,

01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:36.260
we can look in to see what that is. Yeah, if it's easy enough, why not? Um, we also

01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:41.060
got one, um, these are actually put in, that last one and this one that I'm about to actually

01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:45.860
put in through the website. Cool. So that's pretty cool. Um, first of all, the catch thing

01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:51.060
you got here is fucking terrible. Okay. Um, I got it wrong because it's really confusing

01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:55.900
and erased my whole goddamn message. Um, I don't really think that's the fault of the

01:45:55.900 --> 01:46:01.260
program. Um, anyway, I was just wondering why the show takes so long to go up now. It

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:05.700
used to go up the day after recording. Do not take this as a complaint. I am just curious.

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:11.820
Um, just because we, my set up here changed and I have two computers now that I have to

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:15.660
go back and forth between and then also this week I was on a work trip. So it's just, I

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:21.500
try to do it as I can. Other people are offering to help make the process go faster. So we'll

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:27.340
hopefully get on that. So sorry. Last email and actually, you know what, I'm going to

01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:32.660
save this one for a last minute story, Rob. Okay. But I am going to go ahead and credit

01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:39.140
the story to, um, well they didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say, um, Nigel, thank

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:45.500
you. All right. And it will be one of our last minute stories. Congrats. You have contributed

01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:50.860
to the show. All right. Level up. The winner is you. Here's a no prize. All right. If you

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:55.820
want to send us emails, mailbag orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send them to. Let's get back

01:46:55.820 --> 01:47:02.180
into some gaming news. Loki. Yes. Um, so there's some really neat download content that's going

01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:09.780
to be coming out very soon for F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin. It's called the Toy Soldiers

01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:14.460
download content. And what it is is it's a few multiplayer maps that they're adding in,

01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:18.700
but what's kind of neat about it is it's all done from the perspective that you're small

01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:24.860
little toy soldiers fighting in these giant areas. So for example, some of the maps that

01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:30.660
they have, they have, um, you know, a hospital room that you'll actually fight around in.

01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:35.740
They have a playground. And then finally, one that Jamie, I think, will like. They have

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:42.980
one that you fight inside of a pinball machine. Sweet! Um, so yeah. Very cool. Kind of a unique,

01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:46.740
you know, twist to the whole multiplayer stuff. And I'm glad that they're actually kind of

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:50.220
having a little bit of fun with it. But, um, looks pretty sweet. I have to say that the

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:55.220
pinball machine looks the best out of all of them. Now only if the giant, you know,

01:47:55.220 --> 01:48:03.500
metal balls rolling around in there too. That'd be cool. Hmm. But, um, no word on when exactly

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:09.260
these will be available. Oh, I guess it'll be in April and it will be free. So that's

01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:16.580
awesome. Free stuff is always welcome. That's the best kind of download content is free.

01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:23.680
Well, a new trademark has been filed this week. Sing Hero is the trademark. Of course,

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:30.940
you know, that was by Activision and Blizzard, the folks behind Guitar Hero and DJ Hero.

01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:35.940
Apparently now Sing Hero has been patented. Um, what do you think? Is this going to be

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:44.900
their version of Sing Star or Karaoke Revolution or Milk of a Hero franchise? Mm hmm. Uh, although

01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:49.800
I will say though, keep in mind this company also trademarked Drum Villain and I don't

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:54.060
think that ever happened. No. So just because they trademarked it doesn't mean the game

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:59.060
is actually going to happen. Yeah, but they also could mean just because, you know, they

01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:04.360
trademarked Drum Villain, maybe they just rolled that into Guitar Hero World Tour. But

01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.900
Singing is in Guitar Hero World Tour, so I'm not sure why they are going to have this whole

01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:12.700
separate game. Well, maybe this is going to have more pop music. That could be. Oh boy.

01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:17.620
Well, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear stories like this, I can just hear

01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:22.100
the sounds of the Guitar Hero franchise being milked even more and that's like after seeing

01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:25.740
the arcade game this week and everything and it's just like, I'm starting to get pretty

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:30.300
sick of all this stuff and it just makes me angsty because, you know, it used to be such

01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:34.500
a good game, but now it's just getting, like beating a dead horse. So I get angsty and

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:54.420
that's why the FUs of the week happen. I have a couple of FUs, but one of them is a very

01:49:54.420 --> 01:50:02.300
big, very major one and it's directed towards my body for reasons that I choose not to disclose

01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:08.180
publicly at this time, but certain people know what I'm talking about. And the second

01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:19.180
one goes towards a lack of tact. I'm dead. Loki! Happy to Burger King for burning my

01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:25.300
fries. I have never, honestly I'd expect this kind of thing from McDonald's because they

01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:30.420
fuck up their fries more times than not, but Burger King, come on man, your fries are usually

01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:35.940
pretty tasteless and they're fixed by ketchup, but these fries were burnt. I mean, they were

01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:41.980
brown. Oh, and the other thing too, if you ask me if I want ketchup with my fries, don't

01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:47.040
just not give me ketchup. Don't ask me the question and just say, oh, here's no ketchup

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:51.340
for you. You'd like some ketchup, wouldn't you? But I'm not giving you any. I'm not giving

01:50:51.340 --> 01:51:01.060
you any. So F you to minimum wage Burger King workers. Well, geez, and as GS68 in chat says,

01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:06.260
poor, poor Loki's fries. I don't really have anything that major this week. I guess two

01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:11.460
F yous. One F you goes to jet lag because that sucks and my sleep has been all screwed

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:15.500
up like for the past four days because of it. I was in Washington DC this week, by the

01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:20.180
way, just for a few days. If you were following me on Twitter, you probably saw some of that

01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:25.020
video. Otherwise my only other F you would go to the fact that we have no Dunkin Donuts

01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:31.100
here in California, at least in NorCal. And that's sad because I fricking love their coffee.

01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:36.220
But I actually, I actually brought back a Dunkin Donut for my roommate on the plane

01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:40.940
from Texas because I always gush about, you know, Dunkin Donuts, even though the donuts,

01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:44.780
the donuts are only okay. Like to me, I'm not as huge on the donut. It's the coffee.

01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:51.620
I love the coffee. They're not bad. If my five year old memory serves me right. They're

01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:57.500
not bad at all. So that's really it. Those are my not so serious F yous of the week,

01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:00.780
but that's what I've got. I guess the jet, the jet lag one's actually pretty serious.

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:05.020
That really was annoying. I did want to say though about a Sing Hero. I wanted to read

01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:09.140
some comments here in chat about that because I thought one of these in particular was pretty

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:15.660
good. Game Guru, I believe said that they might just be trying to protect their trademark.

01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:19.580
I think it's just protecting trademarks says Game Guru about Sing Hero. And that could

01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:22.540
be the case. Do you think they're just trying to trademark the name so nobody else tries

01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:29.020
to use it? That could be. Maybe. I hope that's the case. If that's the case, then I remember

01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:35.140
a Game Guru also says, I always remember that Dunkin Donut cereal. Me too. Hmm. I actually

01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:39.980
remember that too. They sold that here too. And they don't have Dunkin Donuts. Oh, whatever.

01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:44.260
Hit stun says F you Sky. You have arcades with Street Fighter four and we don't. I do.

01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:49.140
Oh, I guess here in California. Yeah. I just haven't driven to them. Not around us. Not

01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:55.100
here in SAC, but we do have the Guitar Hero arcade now and they have Mario Kart too, which

01:52:55.100 --> 01:53:00.100
I didn't check out, but they have that. I thought that would be fun. You can go play

01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:06.180
it. Yeah, but I don't know. I didn't really care for Mario Kart arcade. It was kind of

01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:10.740
lame. It was, but maybe the sequel has fixed some things. You never know. No doubt it.

01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:17.900
All right, let's get into another story. They need more F-Zero GX. They do need more F-Zero

01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:23.500
GX. Well, there is another interesting thing. You know how all these Lego games been coming

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:30.900
out? There's more. More, more, more. Which means people must be buying all the ones that

01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:35.020
are out there now. You know what though? They're doing it for a good reason because they are

01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:41.100
pretty damn fun. But once it's sort of a late franchise now, they're doing a Harry Potter

01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:46.420
Lego. It's never too late. I'm not saying what exactly it's going to be, but maybe it's

01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:54.940
going to be a walk through some of the other books. And then there is a Lego Indiana Jones

01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:59.980
2 The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. As long as you don't have the fucking ending crap

01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:06.540
in it. God damn it. And they're also pitching to Peter Jackson for a game based off of the

01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:14.300
upcoming Hobbit movie. Lego Hobbits? Lego Hobbits. I totally saw the whole Harry Potter

01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:18.740
thing coming out. After all, they do have the Lego Harry Potter toys. And Lego Indiana

01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:24.860
Jones 2 or whatever they're going to be doing. I love Lego Hobbit. As much as the fourth

01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:30.420
movie sucked, the first game really, really sold well for them and still continues to

01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:37.020
sell well for them. I'm not surprised at one bit. But basing your game, I would have to

01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:44.220
guess it would probably be the original game plus the new stuff as well. I don't know.

01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:47.300
They're kind of fun. I mean, I understand why they're coming out. It's not like one

01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:52.060
of these games I look at and go, WTF? Why are we getting this? But I get this. So it's

01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:55.500
not really a surprise at all. And you've been speculating, Loki, for quite some time that

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:59.660
the Harry Potter game is going to be the next Lego thing. Of course. This is no surprise

01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:03.460
at all. If they've got a toy for it, they're going to make a game for it. Now, if you see

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:08.140
like all of a sudden Lego Halo, you know, stuffed toys coming out, then you better believe

01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:11.020
that there's going to be a Lego Halo game at some point. But otherwise it's an April

01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:15.700
Fools joke. Yes, otherwise it's an April Fools joke. Fair enough. I wouldn't be surprised

01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:18.500
if we see another Lego Batman game because that's something that they can keep adding

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:27.900
to and basically have unlimited content for because they're not basing off movies. So

01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:31.420
that's a problem basing stuff off movies. They don't make any more movies. You have

01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:35.860
no more games. Another comment from Game Guru in chat. Unfortunately, Lego Prince of Persia

01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:41.460
will likely be next when the toys come out. Will it though? Because they rebooted the

01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:46.940
Prince of Persia franchise recently. Won't they make this sequel in that kind of way?

01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:51.540
I don't know if they'll do a Lego Prince of Persia game. The problem being is that it's

01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:57.520
a Warner Brothers own franchise. Well, the Lego Star Wars stuff that was LucasArts, but

01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:04.500
you know, basically they're doing Warner Brothers stuff. So, maybe. I mean, if they do, if the

01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:08.420
movie comes out and it's really popular and stuff and everyone's interested in it, I don't

01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:11.900
know if they're really going to do it. It would all depend on how many toys come out

01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:16.460
and how well the toys do. Rice Princess in chat says, I love Lego games. I love Harry

01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:24.540
Potter games. The two combined would make my head asplode. Let's see. Gio Vaidya says,

01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:30.020
Lego doesn't sell the HP sets anymore. You can't even get the sets off Lego.com. That's

01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:37.900
true. Hmm. Interesting. Dark Tetsuya says, still waiting on Lego Watchmen. Yeah, I don't

01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:43.860
know about that one. Will it come complete with a detachable penis? For Dr. Manhattan.

01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:49.060
Special soundtrack by King Missile. No, he'll have, he'll have his little like, you know,

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:57.580
molecular underpants, which I did not understand because, you know, they, he could wear underpants

01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:02.020
but he didn't and he doesn't really exist. I never saw the movie. The whole point was

01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:08.180
that he's detached from humanity and humanity's standard so it doesn't matter to him if he's

01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:12.420
dressed or not. Because, I mean, seriously, if you think about it, one of the Viet Cong

01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:16.540
will be really scared of a giant glowing blue penis that's coming towards them. I mean,

01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:22.500
you know why? I am so down with Dr. Manhattan. He was wearing his black pants. Exactly, that's

01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:25.700
what I'm saying. He should have just been buck wild there. I mean, I'm just going to

01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:29.020
do the show naked from now on. I agree with what Dr. Manhattan said. Really, it doesn't

01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:34.940
matter, you know, no amount of blue penis makes that movie any good, so, oh well. Sad

01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:40.220
trombone. Sad trombone, yes, very much so. Something that's not so sad though is the

01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:46.420
popularity of Call of Duty 4. It has reached 15 million online players now, which is no

01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:51.260
surprise for anybody that plays Call of Duty 4 and of course, you know, this will be good

01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:55.780
for the new Call of Duty game that's scheduled to come out this year later, Call of Duty

01:57:55.780 --> 01:58:02.260
Modern Warfare 2. So, that should do just as well, since it's going to be Infinity Ward

01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:08.580
again, because everyone knows that Treyarch sucks. I know a lot of people who play Call

01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:16.260
of Duty 4. This number doesn't surprise me one bit. No. Well, as if there weren't enough

01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:19.820
people that were going to be lining up to buy the new Beatles Rock Band game. I'm not

01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:24.700
lining up to buy this game. Well, you're one of not many, because there's a lot of people

01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:28.660
who are very interested in this game. Apparently though, Danny Harrison, that would be the

01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:34.460
son of George Harrison, one of the Beatles who passed away a few years ago, he was interviewed

01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:39.820
by Billboard recently, and they were talking about the Beatles Rock Band game. Apparently,

01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:45.220
what Danny said is that, or it might be Donnie, sorry, it's going to come with some new material,

01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:53.380
stuff that has never been heard and never released. Huh. That could be very interesting.

01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:56.420
So that, I mean, as if this game wasn't going to sell to the Beatles collectors already,

01:58:56.420 --> 01:59:00.740
imagine if this game has never before heard Beatles stuff. I couldn't believe that anything

01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:07.260
like that still exists, to be honest, but there you go. Apparently, by the way, Donnie,

01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:11.460
who's the son of, of course, George Harrison, he's been a big part of actually trying to

01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:15.300
get the Beatles Rock Band to happen. He's in a band of his own who has an album coming

01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:20.100
out this month. He actually took the project to Apple and sort of convinced everyone, because

01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:26.500
of course, not Apple as in the iPhone people, but Apple Music, right, and convinced everyone

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:32.380
to sort of have a presentation. The game has been in the making for two years. They say

01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:37.980
it's historically accurate, a real headache, but it's the most enjoyable work that he's

01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:43.620
been a part of apparently. So it sounds like it could be interesting. Could be. 9-9-0-9

01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:48.620
is when this game's coming out. It's pretty hard to forget that release date. Well, hey,

01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:53.820
all we have to do is remember Dreamcast. Or that. Yep. Which, oh, you know, I forgot to

01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:57.380
mention in the gaming week, we actually did bust out the Dreamcast and go through some

01:59:57.380 --> 02:00:03.500
Sonic Adventure. Nice. Yeah. All of our VMUs still work. Oh my gosh. We have all of our

02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:13.060
Samba files too. So, here's some other news. You know, Wallace and Gromit, still out there.

02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:19.580
There is actually a game coming out on March 24th with a demo on the 16th. Telltale Games

02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:26.700
is putting this out. But it's part of, as far as I'm aware, the episodic Wallace and

02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:35.700
Gromit's Grand Adventures. So, hey, keep your eyes open for it. And there's also gonna be

02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:44.060
another Strong Bad game. If you pre-order Wallace and Gromit, you'll get a full episode

02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:51.740
of actually Sam and Max and Strong Bad. So there you go. That's pretty cool. Nice. Nice

02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:59.700
little bonus there. I like full games as bonuses. That's a good deal. Definitely. Now this is

02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:07.900
kind of not new to the MMO scene, but Final Fantasy XI has finally jumped on board, much

02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:12.900
like the Blizzard Authenticator. They now have something very similar to that that will

02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:21.860
generate random passcodes every few minutes, I guess. It's the Final Fantasy XI security

02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:27.380
token. And, of course, the constantly changing login passwords will apparently protect your

02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:35.620
account from hackers. And the only thing, though, is they haven't released a price for

02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:42.900
it yet. But it will come with some in-game exclusive items when you purchase this token.

02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:52.300
Huh. Okay. So you get special stuff in the actual game? Yes. You get, like, stuff in

02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:58.300
the game. Hm. Nah, I'm still not interested in going back. Sorry. Alright. One more story

02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:02.100
for you guys, then we're gonna open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on

02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:06.060
Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Oh, I was gonna, real quickly, I was gonna mention the Van

02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:13.020
Deal Collection. Yeah, $14.99 now. Oh my gosh, on Xbox 360? And Windows. Wow, they're really

02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:18.860
trying to get new crack addicts on that game, because, you know, you pay that once, they

02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:22.740
might as well just give the game away, because you get 30 days for free with that, and $14.99

02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:27.140
is how much it costs a month, right? Yeah. I'm surprised they haven't gone the route

02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:30.260
of just doing a downloadable demo, or have they, and I just missed that. I don't know.

02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:33.780
Maybe they did, and I might have missed that. Alright, look, one more story for you guys,

02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:38.980
completely different side note here, but something also to kind of take a note. Here's the thing.

02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:43.940
This guy from a Yale University, he's a Yale University student, so you know he's smart.

02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:49.700
His name is Jesse Meiman. Or is connected. Yeah, could be. There's a report in the Cincinnati

02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:55.580
Enquirer that Jesse's a little pissed off, because he flew US Airways, and he was flying

02:02:55.580 --> 02:03:01.500
them in December from Connecticut to Ohio, and they basically lost his Xbox 360. He went

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:05.420
to pick up his luggage after he landed, and he noticed that everything was there except

02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:10.780
for the Xbox 360 and all the accompanying components, so I'm assuming he believes that

02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:17.940
it was theft. His suit says after that that he got weeks of an unconscionable runaround,

02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:24.640
so you know what happened next, right? He's suing them. He's suing US Airways for a million

02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:32.860
dollars for the loss of the Xbox. That apparently is the maximal amount allowable by law. One

02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:39.380
million dollars is what he's suing for. He says that thing was his DVD player. He's a

02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:43.740
film studies major. I don't know why you're using the Xbox 360 issue. Well, I guess I

02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:47.980
can see that. Don't you have a Blu-ray player? Upscale on the HD, right? I guess. But anyway,

02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:51.580
here's the thing. He wants the airline to pay him $1,700 for the loss of the gaming

02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:56.020
system because apparently he probably had his own editions on it. I don't know. And

02:03:56.020 --> 02:04:03.620
for non-economic distress of at least $25,000, but he's seeking the maximum, one million.

02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:08.140
Go figure. I don't know exactly how that works. But here's the thing. US Air would like to

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:15.860
point out their policy state that the federal loss limits are capped out at $3,300 per bag,

02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:22.260
and the airline's luggage policy excludes liability for electronics. So something you

02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:25.900
might want to think about before you take these expensive electronics online. But if

02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:29.660
that specific thing is missing, then it's clearly a case of theft. Yeah. I could see

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:37.340
if maybe he, you know, and the other thing they could do too is they have his bag, you

02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:43.380
know, they have it scaled in there, they know what the weight of the bag was, and then when

02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:47.860
the bag gets to wherever they should have scaled it again, oh, there's a clear difference

02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:54.300
in weight in the bag. I mean, those Xbox 360s weigh like 15 pounds, you know. Obviously

02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:59.060
they stole it. I mean, there's no way that it didn't break, you know, during the flight,

02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:04.020
which, you know, that I don't see really being the airline's fault. I mean, but the fact

02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:08.420
that it was stolen is a little different. But at that same time, he should only get

02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:14.740
compensated for the replacement of the system. Not a million dollars, not even $3,300. Some

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:19.220
comments from chat, because of course you know the chat is interested in this. SSJ100Matt

02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:24.060
says, I always bring my console on the plane with me or not at all. True, he could have

02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:28.660
brought it in just to carry on, right, if it was that important. Dekeman says, if it

02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:32.900
was broken, yes, but it was stolen. If you ask for a million, though, suddenly a settlement

02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:37.220
of $500,000 is looking pretty good. So maybe this guy's just trying to highball it, I don't

02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:45.220
know. You just try to highball it. Gripper01 says, God help Microsoft if it ever red rings.

02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:51.320
What a good point. So, alright. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:54.980
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to open up the Skype line, take a couple of

02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:59.060
calls. Probably not too many tonight, because we are running a little long tonight, but

02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:03.660
we also want to get to last minute stories here in just a little bit, and all that fun

02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:07.620
stuff. So, go ahead and give us a call now. We do have a call, we'll go to that. Hi, you're

02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:16.380
on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? It's GS68. Hey, GS68, what's on your mind? Hold on. Okay,

02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:24.420
I'll wait. I got Gradius Rebirth this week. What? I got Gradius Rebirth this week. It

02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:31.900
came out this Monday, much to my surprise. Oh, Gradius 3, tell us, wait, Gradius Rebirth

02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:38.020
or Gradius 3? Rebirth. Ooh, tell us a little bit about Gradius Rebirth. I'm going to put

02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:43.900
you on with Loki here, I got to take care of something in the studio. Alright, then.

02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:51.820
So, tell us about the game, what do you think of it? Yeah, basically, it's a new Gradius

02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:57.420
title, and it looks more like a 16-bit or 32-bit Gradius game, kind of like Gradius

02:06:57.420 --> 02:07:06.500
for your, a bit like Gradius Gaiden, and it's more of a remix of older Gradius games rather

02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:13.380
than a completely new title. I'm watching a replay of myself right now, and my replay

02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:23.140
is on stage 2, which looks like a level from the MSX and MSX game. Okay. Sounds pretty

02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:30.980
cool. But, yeah, it's only five stages, though. For 1,000 waypoints, that might turn off a

02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:38.940
few players, but as a result, Gradius 3, I just had to get in the game. And one of my

02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:45.420
favorite things is on stage 1, there are two enemies, and it destroys either one first,

02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:50.060
you can change the entire stage depending on which enemies are, like, if you don't destroy

02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:55.500
either, the stage continues as normal, but if you destroy the top enemy, the stage becomes

02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:59.780
frozen. If you destroy the bottom enemy, all the units in the stage become active and the

02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:10.020
stage gets harder. Huh. That's kind of neat. Yeah. And then, looking at the weaponry sort

02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:15.020
of game, you have the usual Gradius title, which is like regular missile and double and

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:21.580
laser, and then you have another one where you have a bomb attack, and then a twin laser

02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:27.020
that's weaker than the, it's not as powerful as the regular laser, but it shoots faster,

02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:33.900
and then there's two unlockable setups that are more or less for more challenging players,

02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:40.300
I guess. Hmm. Well, that was pretty cool. I was actually kind of thinking of checking

02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:46.940
this out, I just haven't gotten a chance to download it yet, that and that new one that's

02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:51.580
coming out on Monday here, Bit Trip, or was it Bit Trip Beat or whatever, it looks pretty

02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:58.420
awesome. But hopefully, you know, I know they've been probably a little bit inspired by the

02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:03.060
Mega Man 9 stuff, so hopefully we see more of these retro remakes that aren't exactly,

02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:10.300
you know, retro, I guess. That's kind of cool. It still kind of feels like a new Gradius

02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:17.380
to me, at least. It was Mega Man 9, it felt like it was playing an old NES game. Yeah.

02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:24.860
You know, I always... Yeah, because it got, for a game that some say looks like 16-bit,

02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:33.580
the graphics are a little, on the more colorful side. Hmm. I hope they bring some of this

02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:38.420
stuff out, you know, I can see you make, they should do a Gradius collection on like DS

02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:42.940
or something, and have this in there. They have a Gradius collection on PSP in Japan.

02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:47.620
I know, but they, well they have it here too, but they all have... They have a Parodius collection.

02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:53.380
But they need it on DS as well. I'll use Salamander collection, but the fact that it's my old

02:09:53.380 --> 02:10:00.380
PSP has a crappy D-pad, it's turning me off from it. Hmm. And I don't want to get a new

02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:05.820
PSP, because then I'll have to restart my DKMax save files, because they're locked at

02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:14.900
a current PSP. Yeah. Well, cool. Is there any other WiiWare games you're looking forward

02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:23.460
to checking out? Um, don't think so. I have a few favorites that I want to buy. I have

02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:36.820
a few older games that I've been wanting to buy. Cool. So, crisis averted? I guess. Oh,

02:10:36.820 --> 02:10:42.460
no, we have Rob trying to find his microphone. Yes, we're back to normal, sorry, but I'm

02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:48.860
sorry I missed the review, but let me just quickly ask for a summary. Is it worth breaking

02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:58.380
my boycott over? Hmm. It's certainly not the best... Well, it depends on what game is enough

02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:04.820
to make you break your boycott. I mean, there's more of a game for hardcore Gradius fans,

02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:09.380
like, I mean, most people feel like it's part of the fact that it's only five stages, and

02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:15.300
it doesn't really add much to the series. Hmm. Well, yeah, I know, and there's some

02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:19.300
comments from chat, like GameGuru says, Final Fantasy IV, the after years will be cool as

02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:23.060
well, and yeah, those are other types of games I'm looking forward to, so I just hope Nintendo

02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:26.540
will fix their freaking storage problems sooner rather than later, because, you know, even

02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:34.380
I admit my boycott is getting stupid. I'd like Defender Castle to get this game. We'll

02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:37.300
see, we'll see. I do love Defender Castle, though. Alright, we're gonna let you go so

02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:39.820
we can get some more calls, but thank you for the review. Sorry I wasn't here to hear

02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:45.560
it all. Alright. Alright. Yeah, it's cool. Later. Alright, yeah. We had, like, an insect

02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:48.760
outbreak here in studio, because a piece of my sandwich fell on the ground, so all the

02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:53.480
ants rose up from the ground and were like, rah! They rise from the grave. They rise from

02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:58.580
your grave, and so they all decided to, yeah, have a piece of that. I thought it was cute

02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:02.580
how you took care of it. Well, I took care of it right away, right? Alright, let's take

02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:06.140
a couple more calls here tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this? Hey, that

02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:11.460
was pretty quick. It's me, Ranma. Hi, Ranma. Hey, what's up, everyone? Not much. We're

02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:17.100
ant-free now. What's up? I just want you guys to know that I took one for the team two weeks

02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:21.100
ago, and I want some type of compensation for it. Oh, dear. What's this about? We don't

02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:26.940
have compensation. We don't get compensated, so this has got to be good. I actually sat

02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:31.940
there and watched Street Fighter, The Legend of Chun-Li. Hey, no one made you do that.

02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:35.900
We warned you in advance. Yeah, that's right. We told everybody that was gonna be a pretty

02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:41.060
shitty movie. See, the fact of the matter is I didn't even pay for it. I went and downloaded

02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:45.940
it, because I said I am not spending $1,125 on this piece of crap. Not that we would usually

02:12:45.940 --> 02:12:53.180
advocate piracy, but maybe in that case it'll be okay. Yeah. I mean, they made the movie

02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:57.620
a little bit too realistic, and I don't care if I give spoilers or not, because that's

02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:04.400
how bad this movie was. Alright. Number one. Bison should not be walking around in a mustache

02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:14.100
and a goatee. Okay. Number two. Vega's mask should not look like a cross between Vader

02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:23.220
and Shy Guy. Ew. Number three. In the fight sequence in the club, Chun-Li could have at

02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:29.100
least had some type of blue dress or something to signify her traditional outfit, you know?

02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:33.940
And how the hell does she have injuries on her when you didn't look like she had any

02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:42.180
in the movie when she was fighting? I don't know. Not for nothing, I'll say this. After

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:49.140
seeing this movie, the original Street Fighter is ten times better, and I am so looking forward

02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:58.540
to Dragon Ball Evolution after this. I don't know, it doesn't look, well, Dragon Ball Evolution

02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:04.860
doesn't look as bad. Pretty much. I'm just saying, I think after seeing this, that's

02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:10.340
gonna be a lot better. Maybe he could do both in one day, and then if you watch them back-to-back

02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:14.220
and you watch this first one that's really craptacular, the second one won't seem so

02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:22.900
bad. Do you think it's a shoo-in to win all the Razzie awards next year? No, I don't think

02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:33.100
it's that bad. Now if U.A. Boyle had anything to do with it, by default, it would. Okay.

02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:39.060
Do you think U.A. Boyle makes better movies than this? I can make better movies than this,

02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:50.180
and I have an amateur digital camcorder I got from Joe Dea that I'm borrowing. Well, congratulations.

02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:58.140
My sister, who is graduating from Hofstra as a degree in Filming, she could do something

02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:07.500
better than this. I've seen her do better work than this, you know? Well, every actor,

02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:14.740
every director usually has a stinker somewhere in their career, so what can you do? I know,

02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:18.780
I know, and it does help the fact that my roommate is a big Chun-Li fan, and I warned

02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:24.820
him, so, yeah. Well, you know, we all told you it would suck, and I have yet to hear

02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:29.140
anybody say it's good. I want to hear a good review on this movie. Has Rotten Tomatoes,

02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:34.460
is it zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes? I think it is, somebody just linked Rotten Tomatoes

02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:37.480
there in chat, I'm gonna look at this, see if it still has a zero percent from all the

02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:45.140
critics out there. I don't wanna see your stupid ad, come on. I'm skipping the ad right

02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:52.900
now. Yeah, I'm trying to skip it too, but it's so frickin' slow. Alright. Four percent.

02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:58.180
Somebody gave it a positive review. Here it is from Variety, of course it's Variety. Neither

02:15:58.180 --> 02:16:01.980
the best nor the worst of movies derived from video games, Street Fighter, The Legend of

02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:10.140
Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to oogle besides the titular heroine. Huh.

02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:14.420
Well there you go. A whopping four percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, Rama, nobody forced

02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:18.100
you to watch it, I don't know what to tell you. I was bored, what can I tell you, I couldn't

02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:24.740
get any alcohol. No compensation for Morison's Radio, sorry. Our compensation is go watch

02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:30.920
Silent Hill again and see a good game movie. Yes. Or the original Mortal Kombat if you

02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:35.780
ask me. The first Mortal Kombat was fantastic. Yeah, it's not bad. Yes it was. I'd even,

02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:44.180
I would even say it was really close to theme. The second one is Time Is Life, you know,

02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:50.500
I wish I had back. I hope the third one comes out some day. Alright, Rama we're gonna let

02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:54.540
you go so we can get some more calls, but take care buddy, okay? You too, alright, later

02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:58.620
everyone. We'll try to do at least one more call here. Do we have any last minute stories?

02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:05.740
Dark Sakura, I know you had one. You alright over there? Dark Sakura's gonna hopefully

02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:11.620
give us a last minute story here. Anyway, I'm glad the microphone didn't catch that.

02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:14.260
Let me actually go ahead and take a call because our phone's ringing off the hook here. It

02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:18.860
just took a little bit. Hi Aaron, I'll show you, who's this? Sorry. Hey, this is Ray,

02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:23.020
this is actually my first time calling, I've been listening to this show for four years

02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:27.760
now I guess. Well. Two years now, I've missed once. It's good to hear from you, I'm sorry

02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:32.540
I missed your name because you're a little quiet. What was your name again? Oh, Ray.

02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:39.780
Ry? R-A-Y. Oh. R-A-Y, yeah, it's my real name, heaven forbid. Okay. Well what is up, Ray?

02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:44.420
Uh, nothing really, it's 11 o'clock on spring break, all my friends are away, I have nothing

02:17:44.420 --> 02:17:49.100
to do but stay up till 11 o'clock and listen to this show, I love it. I don't think I've

02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:53.100
missed a week. Well, thank you very much, we appreciate you listening to the show. Did

02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:56.700
you hear something on tonight's show that you wanted to comment on? Any of the stories?

02:17:56.700 --> 02:18:02.980
Yeah, actually, uh, indie games pretty much. I can't remember the specifics because I was

02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:05.580
just thinking of something to call about, so I'm not just here battling like an idiot

02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:10.260
on the internet, but Cave Story, has anyone played it? I'm pretty sure it's low-key, might

02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:15.140
have. Um, no, tell us a little more about this game, I don't think I've heard of this.

02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:21.980
Uh, Cave Story. Have you ever heard of Cave Story? It's a PC title, it's pretty cool.

02:18:21.980 --> 02:18:26.260
Oh, I guess it's coming to the Wii. Oh, okay. It is coming to the Wii, that's why I brought

02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:31.020
it up, because it's getting a graphical redesign, but on the PC, it's free, it's translated

02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:37.300
from Japanese, and it's kind of a, I want to say classic style shooter, sort of like

02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:42.300
Mega Man, but a whole lot harder. No, wait, I'm lying, no, it's a little easier, because

02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:47.860
I beat it, and I'm not that good at Mega Man games. I thought I'd notice that Google Cave

02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:53.660
Story or English translation should come up one of the first few topics. Well, our chat

02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:57.120
room sure seems to know this game, and I'm actually trying to look up a little bit online

02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:01.220
to see if I know anything about this, and sadly, no, I don't know how I missed this,

02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:05.260
I guess I just, I'm not cool. I've talked about Cave Story before. Have you? Yeah, a

02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:09.500
couple times, I don't care for it, but it's neat. Um, I guess they're making a version

02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:16.380
on PSP as well, it looks like? Homebrew. It's a Homebrew project. Oh, okay. Huh, interesting

02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:22.580
though. How did you find this game? I was looking through a list of Homebrew PSP games,

02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:27.740
and I found it there, and I learned more about it, and it had a PC version, which was really

02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:31.780
good. Really good. It's the same game, almost, but it looks bigger, better. I don't know

02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:39.780
why, is it just me, or does this game look very, like, old-school 8-bit NES-style graphics?

02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:47.900
Precisely. Another thing I wanted to mention was, um, Team Fortress 2 had an 8-bit demake

02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:55.660
called Gang Garrison 2. I have not seen this. Oh, it's a side-scrolling, isometric shooter,

02:19:55.660 --> 02:20:01.060
but it's team-based online, and it's anywhere from 10 players at a time to 100 players at

02:20:01.060 --> 02:20:06.660
a time. Huh. Yeah, you can play as all nine major classes, and it's kind of simplified,

02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:11.500
but there's still technique to it, like, uh, the Pyro has the Puffer instead of the Backbringer,

02:20:11.500 --> 02:20:15.980
there's none of the special extra weapons, and you can deflect rockets back, and 50 on

02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:21.100
50 matches are crazy. I've installed it on the computer lab at, uh, my school. It's pretty

02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:27.340
neat. Do they let you do that? We have a kind of lax administrator, and we put it on thumb

02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:33.180
drives anyway, so it's alright. It's only five megs. Gotcha. Alright, alright. Um,

02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:36.700
here's my question. I noticed, you mentioned this game as a demake, and we've talked about,

02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:39.700
I know last week's show we were talking about, like, a Final Fantasy X demake and some of

02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:44.260
this stuff. What do you think makes these demakes so popular, where people go back in

02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:47.460
time and remake games such as, like, you know, Team Fortress 2 or whatever, whatever the

02:20:47.460 --> 02:20:51.860
game is? Why do you think people want to keep remaking, or Guitar Hero has had tons of these,

02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:56.340
like, in the Commodore 64 and stuff. Why do people want to remake these games on old systems?

02:20:56.340 --> 02:21:01.540
What do you think is the allure of it? Well, it's kind of like, almost the opposite of,

02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:09.620
uh, the, what was that? I think it's the opposite of, uh, say, just a second here, how Mega

02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:17.700
Man X, one of the later X games, took the classic Mega Man action from a pseudo-3D view.

02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:21.300
It's sort of strange seeing the new medium, exactly as with the Guitar Hero Commodore

02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:29.540
remake. Hmm. I don't know, I don't get into a whole lot of these. I don't know if I necessarily,

02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:33.060
usually I'm just kind of like, oh, hmm, that's neat, but I don't really have to, like, play

02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:36.020
the whole thing in its entirety, so it's just kind of, it's kind of interesting that there's

02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:40.260
this whole kind of community around there, around the demakes. I always thought it was interesting.

02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:45.380
There's a Silent Hill 2 remake, I think it was, like, Soundless Mountain 2.

02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:49.620
Really? For what system? I know. PC.

02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:51.860
Huh. Interesting.

02:21:51.860 --> 02:21:58.820
Look up, uh, Google TIG source demake composition, or, uh, Competition Camera Witch,

02:21:59.380 --> 02:22:04.980
these funny titles sometimes. They had one for, uh, like a Dig Dug demake, I wonder how they

02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:07.620
pulled that off. I don't know how they pulled that off.

02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:10.660
Dig Dug demake? Wasn't Dig Dug kind of an old-ass game to begin with?

02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:15.940
Yeah, that's what I was wondering. They have one for Left 4 Dead called Left 4K Dead,

02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:20.180
which is Java-based, and it's 4K at 4 kilobytes already.

02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:22.340
Huh. Wow.

02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:24.580
Pretty sure they had a Bioshock demake, too.

02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:28.580
Nah, I've seen the Bioshock demake. Interesting. Wow, there's a whole lot.

02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:32.660
And again, lots of positive feedback to Cave Story in our chatroom. GameGuru says,

02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:36.820
but yeah, Cave Story is a Metroidvania worth buying and it's free on PC. Any PC gamer should

02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:42.180
own it. I might have to just seek that out. So you found that amongst all the chat about Wang?

02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:44.740
What? In the chatroom?

02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:49.380
No, I didn't. I haven't been paying attention to chat, sorry. Well, I mean, I have, but I haven't.

02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:52.580
What's the big deal with Wang? Oh, nothing. Just discussion about Watchmen.

02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:54.020
Oh, jeez. Alright.

02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:56.420
Oh, well, I saw Watchmen. That was an amazing movie.

02:22:56.420 --> 02:23:01.220
Did you read the comics? I've read the comic. They almost used the

02:23:01.220 --> 02:23:04.740
book as a shooting script. Well, I'm kind of disappointed it left out the death of

02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:09.860
the first Night Owl, but they had to make room. Well, question for you. Do you think

02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:13.860
the movie ending was better or the comic ending? And don't spoil it because I haven't seen it.

02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:18.180
Don't spoil it. Just say which one you prefer. They could not have pulled off the comic ending.

02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:22.980
They would have left so many people scratching their heads and to fit the missing writer plot

02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:28.020
into there would have added another hour. The comic ending, the movie ending was so

02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:33.780
streamlined and it worked. I honestly think that the movie ending better fits the audience today.

02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:38.260
That's my opinion. Yeah. Without going into how hokey the comic one was.

02:23:39.620 --> 02:23:45.860
All my friends gave it bad reviews. They went in there expecting like Spider-Man or Dark Knight.

02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:50.660
It's its own own thing. No, this is R-rated, folks.

02:23:51.220 --> 02:23:54.660
The movie ending doesn't make any sense. Yes, it does.

02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:56.020
No, it doesn't. Did you read the comics?

02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:59.860
Yes, I did. A difference of opinion.

02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:04.900
It doesn't make any sense because. I will go see it and be the tie vote.

02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:08.340
Without trying to explain too much of the ending of the movie.

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:15.380
It's because a certain character is aligned with a certain country and if that certain,

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:19.780
you know, thing happened, then everyone would blame the certain country and no world peace

02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:22.900
would happen. It would just be all everybody against the one country.

02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:25.700
Except that it happened within the one country too.

02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:27.220
I'm so confused. It doesn't matter though.

02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:28.820
Anyway. All right.

02:24:29.620 --> 02:24:33.220
Another discussion. We should do a movie cast.

02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:34.260
Someday. Maybe as a one-off.

02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:36.100
We should call it ultimate spoiler cast.

02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:40.580
All right. Ray, I got to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show,

02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:44.980
but thanks so much. And I hope you had a good time on your first call and call again sometime. Okay.

02:24:45.620 --> 02:24:47.060
All right. Sweet. I'll call back next week.

02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:49.780
All right. Later. We may not be here next week, but in two weeks.

02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:51.220
All right. Bye.

02:24:51.220 --> 02:24:51.860
All right. Later.

02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:56.180
All right. We like first time callers. That's a good note to end on tonight, I think. So

02:24:56.180 --> 02:24:58.900
sorry guys who didn't get through. We're going to close up the Skypline for now.

02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:02.740
You can always send us emails, mailbag orange launch, radio.com, or of course we will continue

02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:06.100
to read chat comments throughout the night. We still have some last minute stories, dark soccer.

02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:09.220
I'm sorry. We didn't get to you, but Hey, if I hadn't taken that call, it wouldn't have been

02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:12.580
a first time caller. So I wouldn't have been burping.

02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:24.820
Okay. So, um, there is a, uh, a marketing stunt that went kind of, uh, nuts and it was, um,

02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:30.340
actually by monument PR, um, for Friday the 13th for the launch of resident evil five.

02:25:30.900 --> 02:25:36.660
And the, basically the big stunt was a treasure hunt, um, where about 50, uh,

02:25:36.660 --> 02:25:43.300
members of the public would go and retrieve arms, legs, heads, and torsos from a number of

02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:54.740
different areas. Um, so, um, it was basically, um, part of, you know, like I said, part of the,

02:25:54.740 --> 02:26:01.620
the big campaign. Um, so they, uh, hid all the body parts, um, within the square mile of London,

02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:10.500
like, um, in bins and on window ledges and a hundred people signed up. Um, so, um, basically

02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:19.220
it actually said that, um, the people paying attention to it, passers by complained to the

02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:25.700
police and officers were there at the finishing line, um, to greet the people who are trying to

02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:32.340
assemble bodies. So it's the whole thing. I read about this earlier on the weekend,

02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:36.020
the whole thing sounded stupid and like, it did look kind of gross. Like, you know,

02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:40.180
there's just certain things that, you know, you gotta wonder who the hell thought this was a good

02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:46.980
idea, right? Maybe it was just me. I don't know. Loki. Well, thank you to our emailer and to Jamie

02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:51.140
for that one. Loki, did you have anything tonight? Uh, just some small stuff. Um,

02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:59.540
Watchmen, The End of Nigh 2 has been announced and apparently it is more of the same. However,

02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:05.620
um, it's supposed to be a little bit racier. Apparently it's been rated by the ESRB and

02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:12.100
describes, uh, some sexual content in there, including, um, nice. There's a, let's see here.

02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:17.220
Uh, well basically the sexual content, I guess, is the more racier part.

02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:22.900
Oh, I don't know the blue peen. Well, that's not necessarily in there. As a watch, I guess you'll,

02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:28.580
um, fight in a strip club that includes, uh, go-go dancers in cages, peep show booths,

02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:35.220
and a pornographic film in the background. However, um, in case you haven't played the

02:27:35.220 --> 02:27:40.740
first Watchmen, The End of Nigh, it sucks. And so if it's more of the same, it's more of the suck.

02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:50.260
So don't buy it. Or at least try the demo. Um, apparently Peter Moore of EA is saying that

02:27:50.260 --> 02:27:57.380
Wii Motion Plus is going to put an end to lazy Wiimote gaming. Um, apparently the 1-1, uh, motion

02:27:57.380 --> 02:28:03.540
capture that is part of, um, Wii Motion Plus requires you to actually make the full swing

02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:07.220
when playing a golf game or tennis game. You can't just, like, move your wrists a little bit.

02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:11.620
Which is great, because that'll encourage more people to throw stuff through their TV. Sweet.

02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:19.060
Um, now of course we talked about earlier a free PopCap game you can get on St. Patty's Day,

02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:22.900
but of course there's going to be some more stuff coming out as well, including Little Big Planet

02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:30.660
is going to be giving away a free, um, St. Patty's Day costume. That'll include a beard,

02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:38.660
a shiny green suit, a green top hat, and other stuff to make your character look like a leprechaun.

02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:45.220
Um, also in April there's going to be another free costume that's a Monkey King costume.

02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:50.340
Apparently it was the winning entry of the PlayStation Asia contest, the design costume

02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:55.140
contest. And then there's some more paid costumes coming out later, including a Killzone mini pack,

02:28:55.140 --> 02:29:02.500
Buzz mini pack, Patapon costume, and a Heavenly Sword mini pack as well. But I want some more

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:07.140
damn expansions, that's what I want. More stuff like Metal Gear Solid, because that's awesome.

02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:12.420
And then finally, um, Resident Evil 5 is already going to get some download content.

02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:20.660
The VS download content, it's been dated in Japan. It's going to be available for, um, 250 yen

02:29:20.660 --> 02:29:28.020
and 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live. It is, um, apparently coming out in a few weeks.

02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:35.220
And we'll add in some new online co-op modes, as well as some competitive online options.

02:29:35.220 --> 02:29:40.420
Uh, I guess some four player, um, game modes and stuff like that as well. So that's kind of neat.

02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:44.740
And I'm sure it'll be coming out over here around the same time. That is it.

02:29:44.740 --> 02:29:50.580
All right. Lots and lots of last minute stuff, but it's been a little bit of a busy week. Well,

02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:54.260
we're going to try to wrap things up and get on out of here for the evening. So we got to go

02:29:54.260 --> 02:29:58.740
around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night. Um, brings us to the end of the show.

02:29:58.740 --> 02:30:04.740
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. Your final thought. Blarg. My final thought is Cherry 7-Up

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:09.540
is delicious. And I've had two cans tonight during the show. That can't be healthy. Loki,

02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:16.660
your final thought. Um, my final thought is Pagel is fun. All right. That's going to do it. Thank

02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:20.340
you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting independent radio. Remember,

02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:23.780
if you like what you hear, we do this for free. We do it for fun. We do it for you.

02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:27.860
Just tell two people you know about the show, help us spread the word because word of mouth is how

02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:34.180
we are able to, um, you know, spread the word about our show. So that's it. We will be back

02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:39.140
maybe next week. Stay tuned to the website for updates on the show. Uh, but for sure in two

02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:43.220
weeks, we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. So until then, thank you guys. Have a great
