{"text": " Today, March 15, 2009, GamePro goes game publisher, Call of Duty passes a landmark for online play, and which company is giving away a free game this week? Hello, everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. And we tape live every Sunday night on allgames.com. That's www.allgames.com, All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show about six o'clock Pacific Standard Time on the West Coast, nine o'clock Eastern for the East Coast. My name is Robert, I'm just joining you here every week. Joining us also every week, say hello to Tech Master Loki. How's it going? I'm good. How are you, Tech Master Loki? Doing good. All right, excellent. And also joining us tonight, running fresh in from inside the house, live radio. Say hello to the one and only, Jamie Summers, how you doing? I had beer last night and I feel good. Did you? Congratulations. Much beer was had. But you always drink responsibly, correct? Yep, that's why I have someone else be responsible for me. All right, excellent. All right, and of course, not only do we tape live on All Games Radio, but you can also watch our video feed on Justin TV. Just before the show went live tonight, we were taking a peek at Madworld on the Nintendo Wii, which I guess has quickly become one of Loki's favorite games? Yes. And what is it about Madworld that you're loving? Everything. You brutally murder people. Yeah, I saw you throw the guy into the air jet or something like that, just blood everywhere. Describe this game a little bit for those that have no idea what this game is or the fact that a game like this exists on the Nintendo Wii of all things, try to describe this game real quick. This game is sort of like, um, a little bit like The Running Man. Basically, you are... the terrorists have taken over this one city and they've kind of created this giant murder game show out of it. And you're this guy, Jack, who decides to go ahead and enter this. And basically all the contestants have a poison that's in them and they have to win the competition to get the antidote. So that's what he's doing is trying to kill everybody to get to rank number one. Was this a Stephen King novel? No. Except they were running. That was the Long Walk, Rob. Similar. Similarities, though. But basically, the whole game looks like it's a black and white comic book with lots of splashes of red when you brutally murder people. And I mean, everything from snapping people in half at their spine to cutting them in half with a chainsaw in multiple ways, to throwing them against a spike wall, to setting them on fire, stabbing them with, you know, street signs. There's so many different ways to kill people. It's like, yeah, the graphics are like that old joke. You know the old joke, what's black and white and red all over? But, you know, it's like the newspaper is like the riddle or if you're a smart ass, it's a zebra that just got shot. But now you could say what's black and white and red all over. Mad World is really what the graphics look like. You are black and white and occasionally red. It's very red. As it is, you know, the game would be awesome just with that. But oh no, Sega does not just stop there. They decide that we need sports commentators as well. And who'd they get? Greg Proops and John DiMaggio. John DiMaggio you might remember as the voice of Bender and Greg Proops from Whose Line. They should have gotten Madden. John Madden? John, or at least Frank Caliendo. You gotta, that would be awesome. You gotta save something for the sequel though. And I can guarantee there will be a sequel. And honestly, Greg Proops is amazing and, you know, he was the announcer in Star Wars Phantom Menace during the podrace, right? I think so. Anyhow, enough fanboy over Mad World. I'm sure Loki will talk about this a little more in just a minute. But first, we're gonna get to how was your gaming week and we do always start it off ladies first. Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week? Um, I played some Ragnarok. That's really about it. We've actually been having a different sort of gaming experience in my house, which is called Cleaning Out the Vault. I found so much E3 swag and no one, no one wants any of it, guys, trust me, it's shit. Um, but we've been piling up our systems and realized that we have four Saturns, two Coleco Visions. Dude, I want a Saturn. Talk to my husband. I have two Saturns. No, I don't, I don't. I don't know why I would. I have two Saturns I don't play. What would I play on the Saturn, seriously? But we're debating taking one of our systems and doing a giveaway with it and having, you know, us autograph it or something, you know, maybe who wants a Coleco Vision? Hey. Uh, okay. Good luck getting that shit to work. It works just fine. Does it really? Coleco Visions are awesome. Can you even hook those up to newer TVs? We actually would be, yes, you can do, they have the, um, RCA or not RCA, the, uh, RF. Yeah, they have an RF, but, um, but we also have, um, uh, drive two driving wheels. So we'd have a spare driving wheel. One of ours is Canadian. Um, we have my Super Nintendo, which was the very first system I bought with my own money. That was cool. And the person who owned it before me smoked because it's all yellow. Um, so yeah, we've got piles of stuff just hanging around and so, hey. All right, maybe a giveaway, maybe. Maybe, but we, we did also, um, we have a stack of old, um, strategy guides. A number of them from the eighties. Hey, some of that stuff goes for money on eBay. We have how to win at Castlevania. That's funny. Nice. You win at Castlevania, buy a Dracula, whoo, like in a car. Uh, I'm going to also introduce the chat room right now at this time, chat.orangelandraday.com always when we're taping live on Sunday nights, you know, the listener experience and getting to interact with the show is really what makes this show unique. Um, just kind of reading some comments here from the chat room, um, Tigerclaw says Greg Proops is awesome. Black Wolf points out John DiMaggio is also the voice of Marcus Fenix and he should have done it, and I'm sorry, Quiltipo says John DiMaggio should have done it in his Waka voice. Maybe, I don't know about that. Waka kind of got on my, oh, Waka kind of got on my nerves by the end of Final Fantasy X, but maybe that's just me. Uh, let's see, other thoughts on gaming week. Loki, how was your gaming week? My gaming week was good, I, um, played a few things actually this week, um, starting off with an, I don't know why I decided to try this, Pagle DS. Why have I, you know, it's sad that I found Pagle now, because it is quite addicting. Um, Yeah, wait, I don't know why you're knocking it, isn't it? Isn't this a good thing? I'm not knocking it, I'm saying, ah, Pagle, there's something else to be addicted to, okay. Oh, okay, I gotcha. It was kind of fun, um, so, that's pretty cool, and, um, have you checked out the one on Xbox yet? No. Okay, because I was going to ask you, how is it different on the DS, well, have you played any other version of Pagle? No. Okay, then never mind, you can't answer my question. I was going to ask, is it, how is it different on the DS, but I guess you can't answer that. It's not really that different, I don't think, from anything else, it's, I mean, basically, you control it with the stylus to aim, and then when you hold the stylus in one spot, it'll zoom in, and then you can fine aim with that. Oh, that's pretty cool. And then, um, you know, you stop, button, and it'll shoot, and that's it. Um. SSJ100Matt asks the wife test question, asking would Nellie play Pagle? Maybe, I haven't shown it to her yet. You've got cookies! Um. For those that are randomly yelling out, my roommate just popped in the studio here, um, and it has a really big smirk on his face, I'm trying to figure out, oh boy, okay, John wants to speak on the show. Did we give you a nickname on this show, John? My roommate? My secret nickname is either Roommate or John. Okay, your secret nickname is Roommate or John, we gotta get you a mic here. Alright. Your superhero name would be the roomie. I'm gonna make this short, um, I don't usually play tons and tons of video games, but iPhone game app called Arveil, completely amazing, old school Final Fantasy style game, haven't been able to stop playing it for like three days, and it's fantastic, and I actually paid for the paid version, which is unspeakable and unheard of. So that's my little plug. Wait, tell us a little, how'd you find this game? Tell us a little more about how it plays, because this is unheard of that you actually want to participate in the show, and about video games, and not making fun of me, so I'm, I definitely want to know a little bit more about how you found this and how it plays and all that, like, you know, how do you control it on an iPhone? It's pretty simple, there's a little action button for most things, and there's a little control pad, so it's, you know, left, right, up, down, diagonals, um, found it going through strategy games that were free on the iPhone, and then liked it so much I bought the paid version. It plays like an old school Final Fantasy, like, maybe Final Fantasy 5 or so, I think, and... Wait, am I filling in for Jamie? Am I supposed to, like, grow tits tonight, or be extra sassy? She's just going to the loo, I think. She's going to the soda, which is kind of like the loo? Maybe we should keep the soda in the bathroom. Okay, um, what else was I going to ask, though? Is this game available anywhere else that you know of, or, because some folks in our chat room are saying, I don't have an iPhone, so are they just screwed? Then I would say that their life is incomplete and they need to go buy an iPhone. These are obvious things. I don't know why I'm having to tell your listeners this. Apple thanks you for the free plug. All right. All right, well, thank you, John, for your contributions. Wait, you forgot to wave to Justin.TV. They're very mad. They had to look at your butt the whole time you were talking, and now they want some recognition. All right. Anyhow, uh, Loki. I'm so sorry about that. Anyways, that's okay, that's okay. Other than Pagel DS, I also played Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, which is interesting. It's definitely a different take on Grand Theft Auto, well, not that different, I mean, it's very similar to 1 and 2, but having come off of 4 and Lost and Damned, it is kind of hard to go back to the 2D stuff, or top-down Grand Theft Auto games, but it's okay. Very similar to the older games, they did add some neat touch screen stuff into it as well. Haven't played a whole lot of it yet, so I can't give a full impression on it yet, but it's okay so far. Storyline's kind of, eh, but we'll see, I mean, it might get better, but right now it's kind of cheesy. And then, other than DS stuff, I have also played, of course, more Lost and Damned, still lots of multiplayer in that. Playing around with the glitch of the game, there's a spot where pedestrians spawn in the middle of the air and fall from the sky. Sounds kind of fun. And then, I played a little bit of PS3 today, I went ahead and finally got around to playing the little big planet Contra levels, so that was kind of fun. And I also went and played Nobby, Nobby Boy for a few, I would say, yeah, a few seconds until Nelly's like, that bass sound when you're stretching is really fucking annoying, so I had to turn it off, so I stopped playing that. Yeah, pretty much. She cracked the whip, you had to stop playing. And then, of course, you know, Mad World, you know, that game's awesome in all sorts of ways, and unfortunately I haven't really made it past the first level, because I haven't gotten a chance to actually sit down and play it for a long enough time, so. The first level's really cool, though, so I can't wait. Alright. Well, my gaming week was actually pretty busy, considering I was out of town for like three days, I didn't think I'd have a very busy gaming week, the only thing I really played on the plane was Metroid Zero. Yes, I went back, and it's my second favorite Metroid game, next to Super Metroid, I went back and played on my DS, the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot, Metroid Zero, because that game is pretty fantastic, especially because I'm such a fan of Super Metroid, of course I'm going to like Metroid Zero, it's practically the same thing, but, you know, with different levels and a different layout. So if, you know, you need an oldie but goodie to check out, because this game's probably about five years old now, I think it's from 04, check out Metroid Zero, it was one of the last Advance games, I think, before they started switching over to DS stuff. Otherwise, as far as other stuff goes, I actually took a trip last night with Rice Princess, we went out to Roseville Golf Land, which is the local arcade, and we've given it a lot of crap on this show, because Roseville Golf Land is the place where games go to die. That's what we've always talked about here on the show, because you go there and, you know, you just have to imagine, for those, you know, I know not everybody lives where we live and knows this place, but it's a giant castle with a big golf course and a big water park that they're known for, but it's just like they let little kids just run the frickin' place because of it, and, of course, they don't know how to treat machines, parents don't know how to police their children in a place like that, so the machines- And they change their diapers on the machines. Are always, yeah, oh god, and if you think she's lying, that's a completely true story, that a diaper was once changed on a keyboard mania machine, but regardless, the machines run down, broken, bleh, but we heard they got a BeatMania 2DX machine, so we had to go check it out, and you know what? We went, and I hadn't been in like a year, 18 months or so, and color me shocked, but the place looked really nice. Like they remodeled or something, they did some repainting in there, I didn't find a machine that was broken, everything looked to be in a good state, I mean, granted, I saw a Supernova 2, the monitor was a little junky, but honestly, considering all the parts worked, the Max2 pads worked great, 2DX was in awesome condition, they've come a long way. I don't know if they're under new management or what the hell's going on over there, but we have to admit when things change for the better, and I think that- It's winter, that's why, no money for the water park. Maybe, I don't know, but I've been there in winter before and been extremely disappointed, so I don't know what's going on, but it's working, whatever they're doing, so props to those guys, and sorry for giving you so much crap, but I guess it worked, because the place was in a good state, so I played BeatMania 2DX Distorted, which I played before because I had it at E3 a few years ago, but I haven't really touched BeatMania 2DX in a long time, like it's been a long, long time, probably since this show took a more general gaming approach as opposed to just music video games that we used to do, but I missed it, it was fun. Granted, I found myself playing all old songs, but yeah, I definitely want to go back and play some more. I had a really good time playing BeatMania 2DX, although I still think the newer songs are not nearly as good as the older songs, I'm sorry to say. Questions from chat, Floatwalk wants to know, does R. Vigal still have Disney's Rave? Yes they do, I didn't play it though, but they do have Disney's Rave, and Rice Princess is actually in chat right now saying 2DX was in excellent shape and loud, so yeah, the machine was nice and loud, because you could turn the effectors on and all that. So tell them about, was it Guitar Hero Arcade? Yes, they had Guitar Hero Arcade which I played, I only played it once, so I can't really give a full review on it, I can just tell you I got pissed off, because Roseville Golf Land also switched to cards, they don't use tokens anymore, but cards, and when I was swiping the card through and everything, I somehow hit the button an extra time to start the game and I accidentally got on easy mode, and you can't switch it once you're on easy mode. But to me, honestly, it just looked like the freaking home game, except a smaller song list, and it was just basically Guitar Hero 3 with a slightly smaller song list, and prettier because there's lights on the machine and it spins around and the TV they use is very very crisp, it's a very sharp image, but I don't know, would you want to pay a dollar a game for something you can get at home? But I understand there is an audience for this thing, and it's kind of cool to go out and play with your friends and all that stuff, so I can see where this machine might do decent, but if you have Guitar Hero at home, I don't see the point in this game, honestly. Let's see, what else did I do in my gaming week this week? I played the demo of The Last Remnant on the PC, and I was a little disappointed at how choppy it was, and I just bought this PC back in August, so I know it's not like old parts or anything, but I was a little disappointed at how choppy it was, but the game itself seemed kind of fun, so I might try to check it out on Xbox 360, although the PC wasn't supposed to have all the extra stuff. Pagle on Xbox Live Arcade, I downloaded and played for a while, and good times. You know, I was already addicted to the one online, it's Sparkles and Rainbows and Plinko, it's fun. I need to play some more of the multiplayer though before I can kind of give my full impressions on that, but I had fun playing Pagle, and I think a lot of people are going to check this out. What I like about Pagle versus PopCap's other efforts on Xbox Live, such as Bejeweled 2 and Zuma, is that this doesn't just feel like a port of their PC game, the full one, it feels like they've really tinkered some stuff to work with Xbox Live, hence the multiplayer, and they've really kind of made it special for Xbox Live, and I think that's what's kind of cool about Pagle, it makes it really stand out amongst some of PopCap's other games they've had on Xbox Live so far. Not to say the other stuff was bad, but it was just kind of the same thing that I'd already played on PC if I'd had the full version, and Pagle's kind of a step above that. The last game I will mention that I played this week, Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 was on sale, so I figured, what the heck, I picked it up, I bought it, because I got a new dance mat for Xbox, whatever, and got to play Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3. Do you want to know what the most hilarious thing about Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 is? Okay, they, on the back of the box, they advertise these songs that are in the game, one of them being harder, better, faster, stronger, right? So I was like, okay, I want to check that song out. It's not in the game. In fact, of all the songs that are mentioned on the back of the box, apparently only one of them is actually in the game, and no, it's not, like, I looked on web forums, DDR Freak, which is still kicking after all these years, who knew, DDR Freak apparently confirms these songs are not in the game, but they're advertised on the back of the box. Well, that's false advertising. I know! I say, we sue Konami. What's up with that? We'll turn it around on him. Look, I understand. No, we will sue Konami. I understand mistakes happen and all, but this is a pretty fucking big mistake. You know what I mean? I don't know. That's, that's, I'm surprised they're not trying to send out stickers to Critter. How does something like that happen? Like, who fucked up that bad? It's been out for a while, they probably just figured no one has noticed, you know? My god. Um, but look, look, the game itself, look, putting the box aside and all that trite crap, you know, the game itself is okay. It's not my favorite home version of a DDR game. In fact, I think I even preferred the song list in Universe 1. It's definitely no Ultramix 2. But it's not bad. The interface is pretty slick, very crisp, very vibrant graphics, funny background animations, 2DX fan service, because they have the actual music video for Murmur Twins and some of that stuff in the game, decent licensed songs, some really cute kind of original stuff. A little heavy on certain in-house artists of Konami. I guess maybe there's just been a shift over there where they're starting to use people like Diamashura and 0039.com and some of these people are using them more often, it seems like, than your Naoki, your Takus, and all these guys that probably left, which is why they're having a shift. Also I thought it was strange, the download content, the interface, you can't preview the songs, I never heard of any of them, so I don't know what I want to download. Do they even have download content? My Universe, yeah they do. My Universe 1 songs though did not come into Universe 3, but apparently there's a Universe pack available, so I'm not sure if it's trying to make me re-buy the songs I already bought with Universe 1, and if that's the case, that's kind of crappy. There's a crap load of songs to unlock, so I'll give them a plus there. There's tons and tons of songs to unlock. Quest mode is a little silly though, and I hate how everybody speaks. Everybody talks like people think ghetto people talk. That's how the dialogue has gone, like the whole yo-dog type stuff, like, oh everybody, it's just bad. Dialogue by Randy Jackson. It's bad. Leo Shan asks, was the quest mode like you got served Sky? No, it's weird. It's like this big circular thing, and you go to these different places, and in the first circle you gain coins to challenge people in the second circle, and if you beat them you get the song. It wasn't incredibly difficult. I unlocked the entire second circle in one night, but now it won't let me go to the third circle because I haven't played enough in the first circle, but I don't want to play the easy stuff, but whatever. Eventually you'll get to the seventh ring of hell. It's just like, here's the thing, I don't want to necessarily give this game a negative review because I don't think it's necessarily bad, and I do encourage people to play DDR because I think it's a way to stay fit and exercise, and again, I think everything's pretty sharp. I don't necessarily like some of the creative direction they took in it. I don't think the new quest mode is anything that exciting. I don't think the new interface is that great. I think having the giant CD cover box art thing in the wheels is a bit much. I don't go for it. I'm telling you, if you make me the production director of this series, I could bring it around like nothing. It's not necessarily bad. It's just another DDR game, and at this point these things are a dime a dozen, so I really want to see the DDR teams at Konami really try to reinvent this stuff, and for the love of God, whoever made that big mistake about putting songs on there that weren't actually in the game, that just kind of speaks as to how lazy they're getting. It's not necessarily a big deal, okay, so somebody made a mistake, whatever, but it just speaks volume as to how lazy it feels like they're getting with DDR, which is sad because I know there's a lot of people that work very hard on this series. I've had friends who worked for the series that work very hard on it. It's some of these creative things coming up from the top level. I'm surprised they didn't make a big deal about that everywhere, because hell, they made a big deal out of the IGN watermark being on the Okami cover, and that was something really stupid and small and had no impact really on the game. I don't know, and then there was Super Stardust Portable that was missing modes and stuff that were advertised on there. This is kind of a big deal that there's songs missing from the game that are advertised on there, because that right there, say if you bought it for that song, you're being ripped off right there, and the fact that it's not available for... I don't think even download content would cut it, and it would have to be free download content or a patch or something that would get automatically added to the game or something when you connect it live, but I don't know, it's just cheap and they could have easily affixed it with a sticker or something to go over that part of the box, that way it's gone or something, say at the last minute they decided to pull the rights to it or something. It screams lazy, that's all it is. And I'm just saying, companies, don't think we don't notice when y'all get lazy. There are people that notice and there are people that go, okay, I'm spending $60 of my money on this game, take five seconds to... It's like Nintendo again. Or delay it, that's what every other company does. The problem is, in their quest to branch out to people that haven't tried their games before, or people that normally don't play their games, they have in turn lost the people that do play their games, because they just don't care anymore. It's like shifting your focus to actually increase your market share with groups of people that don't normally play your games, and ignoring your core players and thinking they're just going to stick around is not the way to be thinking. Here's my challenge, this is my last thing I want to say, because I know there are people at Konami that listen to this program, and I'm not just talking about people that are like my personal friends and what have you, but I know there's people higher up. Look, less than three is one of the songs in freaking DDR Universe 3, the same song that was a theme song to Rice Princess' show she had on the old station, okay? If that doesn't prove somebody at Konami is looking out for us, I don't know what does, okay? Here's the thing I want to say to y'all, look, I love DDR, DDR has introduced me to a lot of great people, I would not know Loki, I would not know Dark Soccer if it were not for DDR, however, that being said, do not throw away a good thing, do not be afraid to reinvent yourselves, and I challenge you, step away from making, resist the temptation of doing a Universe 4, or X2, or Disney 3, I want you to nuke your code and start from the ground up, build a new DDR game from the ground up, no recycled code, make a brand new DDR game, and really try to push the limits of what you're doing with it, I think you would really stand to win back a lot of people that are starting to think you're getting a little lazy. They did it before, and what did it do for the community for a while, I mean it really rejuvenated everything when we got the Max series, remember when it was new? And honestly, DDR UltraMix, especially 2, not so much UltraMix 1, but UltraMix 2, and they really were getting in their groove, no pun intended, sold me on an Xbox, it really did. And that was all new code, because they had to make it for the Xbox. Also the other thing too, I think, is the way that they're treating their series, I mean look at Pump It Up, and the new versions of that game, there's a lot of excitement behind it, they bring it out, it's like, BAM, it's a new game, it's awesome, it's got all these things in it, and people get excited about it, but DDR, it's like, oh, new DDR, hooray, this time it's got more Disney characters, hurrah, it's just that no one cares anymore, and they need to really change it up, I'm serious, I have a way to fix this, but no one wants to listen, and I don't feel like explaining it, because, well, it's just, it's all in my head, and unfortunately I can't put it on paper very, you know, but I can explain it, basically the whole quest mode thing, taking a totally different approach to that, basically you have stuff that goes along, because the problem with quest mode is they don't know how to make it where it actually matters, I mean, you can't obviously do it as like a dance off competition thing, because it doesn't make any sense, it's just, you can't do that in DDR, because it's a technical game, it's not based on, you know, doing moves and that kind of crap, but if you make it as something different, like say for example, how well you're doing in a song affects the performance of say, something else that's going on, totally separate things, you know, just basically instead of, you know, your actions on a gamepad or something like that, it's based on the accuracy of, you know, the steps that you're hitting and that kind of stuff, if you make that interact with the other thing that's going on, you can make the quest mode about anything you want, and it doesn't have to be about DDR or anything, you can just really broaden it out there. Alright, we'll see if anyone's listening, you can contact Loki directly at loki at orange launch reader dot com, I'm sure he'll talk your ear off about it. Let me read some comments from chat, I don't want to spend too much more time on DDR, because since we have branched out the scope of our show, I know there's some people that listen that don't really care as much about the music games, but I will say this though, good exercise, you know, if you've never played DDR, try it for the exercise alone. Let's see, comments from chat, Float Walk says two words, national tournament, that's definitely what Pump It Up does, you know, the tournaments they do in Korea are huge, and Float Walk says for crying out loud the tournament scene made DDR's popularity in the states, true facts. Acidic Vampire says what DDR needs is violence like Madworld. DDR does not need violence, at least not that level of violence, I mean, no, it doesn't need that. DDR needs fatalities. But I do agree that you could take the quest mode and literally make it like an RPG type thing, you know, like it's, I don't know, it's, it's hard. No, no, no, no, no, no, I will tell you a reason why RPG stuff will never work with Dance Dance Revolution, and it all goes back to a little known game called Dance Dance Dance. No. I think I remember that game, yeah. Yes, I've played it, and yes it sucks. Alright, anyhow, let's move on, I don't want to spend too much time re-re-reminiscing the old days, although that's kind of what I did this week by going to Golf Land, so there you go. Alright, since that does it for our gaming week, let's get to some housekeeping. Alright, so look, we've sat here and kind of been critical of DDR for the last few minutes, but I will say this, you know, at our heart we do love Konami, and so on, on our website www.orangelandrater.com, they actually have been polling all of our listeners all week long about your top three favorite Konami games since their 40th birthday is coming up, and we're giving them a present now with this week long feature of the best games as selected by you guys, the listeners, from Konami's archives. 1500 Konami games over the years, if you can believe it. Speaking of voting, March Madness is almost over, it's down to the final four, and right now you have Rock Band versus Super Mario Bros. 3, and you have Chrono Trigger versus Zelda Link to the Past, and I believe voting time is going to be up very, very soon, so if you're listening live here on this Sunday evening, you're going to want to go try to get in your last minute votes, and the final two will probably be decided tonight. March 22nd, next week, I'm not going to be here, so I'm not sure if there's going to be a show or not. Stay tuned to our website www.orangelandrater.com for more details, I think they might try to find a way to tape elsewhere, but I will not be here next week, I'm going to be on a trip, but I will be back in two weeks, so we'll keep you posted. Alright, that's really it for housekeeping, just stay tuned to our website. Actually I want to say something about the website real fast, actually. I feel like I've kind of been slacking off, because I haven't been doing a lot of articles for the website or what have you, but it has been so refreshing to go to orangelandrater.com, and I'm seeing new stuff every day, it's completely unreal, but some of our long-time listeners, like Deakman, ActDeaf, DarkTedTsuya, and I'm sure the list goes on, I don't mean to leave people out, but they've been writing articles about indie game spotlights, games you ought to be playing, but you probably aren't, and highlighting music from video games, and it's been actually really cool to kind of go to the site and see this stuff. And what I love about it, is that in a way it's because we're not doing it, it's kind of what this show is all about, letting the listeners have control, and the community, and what the community wants to hear about, so props to you guys who've all been working hard on the website, it's been pretty awesome. And I have an idea for a feature too that I'm hoping to contribute very soon, and I'll be back on posting regular updates very soon. Okay, now I think that's it for housekeeping, let's get into some gaming news, we're only like 30 minutes into the show, let's get to it. Loki, start us off with some gaming news. Yes, so anyways, there has been some concern by MTV's Totillo that there might not be enough exclusives during 2009 for the Xbox 360. Now, unfortunately what Steven doesn't realize is that there are, but he just doesn't understand that there are a lot of things coming out that people think that aren't exclusive are exclusive, and that they think that are exclusive that aren't exclusive, so it's kind of confusing. For example, he says the loss of Xbox exclusive franchises like Mass Effect, unfortunately for him, Mass Effect, I don't think, as of right now, is not, well it is multi-platform, but not with the PS3. So, you know, because right now I think there's only a SKU listing for the Xbox 360 version, I think the other platform they're talking about was PC, which makes sense, because they've released them both, but I think it is going to be exclusive for Xbox 360 right now. And Project Gotham Racing, well, Project Gotham Racing I don't think is even going to be existing anymore, at least if they are going to do another Project Gotham Racing game, I think it's not going to be called Project Gotham Racing, it'll probably be something different, but hey, who cares. And then of course Splinter Cell Conviction, whenever the hell that comes out, you know, obviously it might be one that's going to be on 360, and Alan Wake, also whenever that comes out as well. Then of course there's also Halo 3 ODST, or whatever they're calling it now, and I mean that's just for right now. Obviously they haven't really been talking much about their 2009 lineup, which they're probably saving for E3, you know, they're just going to be like, bam bam bam bam, here's all this shit, you know, that's coming out. But, do you think they are going to, at E3, just blow us away? Um, maybe. I mean, because there's, I can kind of see where this guy has some concerns for Xbox 360, because even, you know, they don't have a big Halo 3 this year or anything of that caliber, I mean, granted you had Halo Wars, but it's not the same thing. You know, there's no big, big must-have title, it feels like we got a lot of that last year. Well, they're not going to let us down with just, you know, the Halo ODST, and that could be what they consider their big title, but then again, that's also right now for September, that's scheduled for September. I mean, we very well could get something else, I don't know if they were going to get another Gears of War, to be honest I hope not, you know, give it some space, but I think there's going to be other things coming out for sure, because they definitely don't like leaving in a lot of months without a Microsoft game coming out, and you know, right now we just had Halo Wars come out, Ninja Blade's coming out pretty soon, you know, there's still a lot more months that there's nothing been announced yet, and I wouldn't be surprised if there's other things, and that's only first-party exclusives, we're not even talking about third-party exclusives yet, but you know, right now, there are a lot of companies that just don't want to develop for the PS3, or they're having trouble developing on the PS3, and it's taken them a lot longer to put out the PS3 version. For example, this isn't a great game, but Leisure Suit Larry boxed off his bus, coming out on 360 in a couple weeks, and the PS3 version's been delayed to May. Another one that people thought is also going to be exclusive to the Xbox 360, at least a timed exclusive, is Bioshock 2, right now I'm not seeing that, right now it's day and date with the PS3 version, but of course, that can change, that's months off right now, so I wouldn't be surprised if there is going to be a lot more stuff announced, and Bioshock 2 is going to be a huge Christmas title, but it's not specific to any system. Yeah, well, I think it actually is going to be coming out in August, just like it did the first time, but there's tons of stuff coming out that we don't know about yet, that are going to be big titles, and I'm sure that each side, both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 are both going to have exclusive titles that are going to be really awesome, so I don't really think it matters about the exclusive titles, because there's just more titles coming out on the Xbox 360 right now, period. Alright, you know, and also, one thing that Microsoft usually does, and I'm sure Nintendo and Sony are going to do this too, especially speaking of E3, you know, they like to unveil things to these big events that are available on live right now, or on PlayStation Network right now. There's something else too that I totally forgot about, Game Developers Conference, which I think is what, next week? Oh yeah. Yeah, so I mean, there's going to be announcements probably there as well, I mean, there's lots of stuff, and not only that, but they're not only focusing on just console stuff, I mean, you've got XNA, which is really hitting its strides now, Xbox Live Arcade, who knows what they're going to go with. I don't think at Game Developers Conference, though, you're going to get huge game announcements, but I think you'll get, like, infrastructure type things. Like, remember, Game Developers Conference was where, like, Home was announced. That was kind of an enhancement to Sony's platform. I don't think XNA was announced at, or no, I mean, XNA was, I mean, NXC, the new Xbox experience, I don't think that was announced at Game Developers Conference, but I could see that being the type of thing, you know, things that affect the developers, you know, things that affect the backbones of these systems, or the types of announcements I would expect to see, you know, upgrades and things of that note. Maybe this would be a great time for Nintendo to finally put out that SD card thing they've been talking about. That would be great. I've got a 2GB card right here, right here, just waiting to go in the Wii, to store all my crap. So, I'm hoping that thing will come out soon. Alright, well, there will be, actually, wait, I've got to read, there will be some comments from chat right now, that's the one I've got to read right now. AcidicVampire is betting at E3 this year, Microsoft will reveal that Final Fantasy XIII Versus will be on the Xbox 360. Hmm. I doubt that. You never know. GameGuru says, Microsoft at E3 will announce that the best non-Sony games that are appearing on PlayStation 3 will also be on the Xbox 360. Amazetatsuma corrects me and says, Microsoft did Gears 2 was announced at Game Developers Conference. So, it is not unheard of for games to be announced at E3. Yeah, because they're talking about the enhancements to Unreal 3, that stuff. You might hear something about Unreal 4, maybe, I don't know, that might be interesting. That could be. Maybe some stuff from id from about Doom 4, because I think they're going to be talking about that and probably rage a little bit. What was I going to say, though, yeah, the whole rumor thing about, like, Final Fantasy Versus, Square has kind of already done that with Xbox 360. If you notice, the last few games that they put out have been only on Xbox 360, and have been exclusive. Star Ocean, Last Hope, The Last Remnant, before that, oh gosh, I'm forgetting now, but yeah, a lot of their RPGs are going to be, you know, strictly on the Xbox 360, but now they're going to start getting some PS3 ones. Infinite Undiscovery, was the other one you were talking about? Yeah, Infinite Undiscovery, that was what I was thinking. Stuff I did not buy. I don't know, so there's going to be a lot of companies that are going to be developing for them, because it's easier to develop on that platform, unless Sony figures out a way to educate these guys a lot faster and figure out how to develop for a lot easier, you know, that's going to be the problems they're going to face, and right now, being this far into the console cycle, it's probably not going to change. So we'll just have to wait for the next round, and we'll see how it goes there. Alright, well let's keep moving with the news here, because we're running kind of long tonight, but that's alright, good discussion, right DarkSakura? What else is new, huh? I know, we're always running long, we're a big fat bloated shell. Hey, let's talk about some other Xbox 360 releases, but this is actually one for Japan, this is something that's going to be coming out in Japan. Obviously, Microsoft's had a little difficulty trying to penetrate the market in Japan, and you know, thanks to some of these, you know, role playing games that Loki was talking about earlier, they've had a little bit of luck, but they still have yet to really just break through and be massive over there. Maybe this will help, because the Japanese love their shmups, shoot em up, shmup. This one is called Mamoru-kun Has Been Cursed, that would be the English translation of this title. It is coming out on the Xbox 360, it's going to come with a soundtrack CD and a super play DVD, that's a limited edition that's coming out on the Xbox 360, coming out for 8500 yen, but if you want the regular edition, it's 5980 yen. Now let me tell you a little bit about this game here, it's been developed by G-Rev, and apparently it does some type of, it has character designs in it by Mizuki Takayama, he did some other famous shmup games. This is actually a translation of an arcade game. Looks like you play a little dude, you're not actually a ship, but it looks like you're actually a little person that's walking around kind of doing the fighting, so kind of interesting. It's about an elementary school student who finds themselves in a nightmarish underworld, so it definitely looks kind of cool. The interesting thing though about these shmups, they don't translate well for widescreen systems, because you know, shmups are usually very vertical-oriented, you can't really turn your TV on its side, so you only end up using a very small portion of the screen. You can if you have a really kick-ass mounting setup. That's true, but people don't usually have that. Well, my husband's new monitor, the widescreen HDMI, has access to PivotOn, and actually a lot more that you're finding these days are built to shift position. And I think some of the games, even the Xbox Live arcade games like Ikaruga I think did support that as well. We have a few Saturn games that actually will let you do that, I can think Thunderblade, one of the Thunderblade games will do it. Well, just to give you an idea of some of the other things that G-Rev has developed, because it's coming out here, they did do some work with Ikaruga and Gradius 5, just so you know. They did some programming and background graphic design for Ikaruga and same thing for Gradius 5, so they have touched those games, and they've also done some work with Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker, which is an old school Dreamcast game. So there you go! This game, a shmup coming out in Japan, no word if it's coming out over here, although I gotta be honest, probably not. Well, how about we shift gears a little bit? Ah ha ha! Cause it's Gears of War 2 patches! Isn't that fun, Rob? Cool! Well, there's going to be a premium map pack called Snowblind that's coming out on March 31st, and it'll have three new maps and a remake of Fuel Depot from the first Gears of War, and it's supposed to bring in experience-based ranking and rebalance the gameplay a bit more, try to give everyone a better sense of progression, and you'll still be using the true skill system, but it's sort of background now. It's really just something to make people feel more, you know, rewarded for how well they do. So you can earn your experience in matches that will get you through 100 levels, you get milestones for, you know, each level, I think, each certain level that you get, so you get an achievement for it, as well as, of course, the packs. So there's a possibility of getting another 250 gamer score points. There's an auto-balancing feature that will put a bot in place if you fall out during mid-match, although you also get an XP penalty, and it will correct scoring issues. So there's no real price on the map pack yet, but as comparison, the combustible map pack is 800 Microsoft points. So the maps that are coming with this, one's called Grindyard, that's a wintery junkyard processing plant thing. It's supposed to be a spiritual successor to Gridlock. There's Underhill and Courtyard also, in addition to the Fuel Depot remake. Very nice. And ActDeft approves in our chat room, Fuel Depot was the best map of the first Gears of War, says ActDeft. That's probably why they're bringing it back. That's probably why it's coming back for another round, absolutely. We like it! Okay, here. Yay! And of course people are going to be excited that they can increase their gamer score by another 250 points. Here goes your E-peen! Well, I just want to say, my E-peen hit a landmark today. Where's your E-peen at? Just today. I crossed 10,000 gamer score today. Woo-hoo! I don't think I'm even nearly there. I think I'm like under 1,000 still. That's alright, slow and steady wins the race. Took me a few years to get here. Slow and steady means Jamie's got other stuff to do. Well, you have to play games with really easy gamer score too, like DDR, like you get an A on a song, you get 50 points, you know things like this. You have entered a shop, champagne! Exactly. So apparently, there's a good use for some of your Xbox 360 systems that may be broken. One use, of course, would be to convert it into a bong, and that's what someone has done, actually. They have converted their Xbox 360 system into a bong. Obviously, it doesn't work anymore, and I'm sure it's been gutted, but yes, now it is a bong, and you can smoke out of it. Awesome. But, of course, you would only smoke tobacco out of it, right? Of course, because anything else would be illegal. Because, you know, everybody smokes tobacco out of bongs. Right. Actually, I do know people who actually will do tobacco in a bong, but I don't do ginseng and other stuff. Is that like a hookah type thing? Yeah, it's pretty much just a modified hookah, but it's the same difference. But, I'm looking at the picture of it, and I would do better with that. I mean, would you really want to turn your Xbox 360, of all things, into a bong? I'd be calling it the Xbox 420. Well, to be honest, you wouldn't have to necessarily have an Xbox 360. You could buy a replacement case, and it's like, just buy a bong. I mean, seriously, it's not even worth, you know, just setting it up. Class, you get a hookah. It's like, why bother, you know? Why bother other than, oh, look, I did that. Okay, great. Now one person's converted their system into a bong, no one else needs to do it, because it's a waste of time. Alright, alright. Am I the only person here who's reminded of Dennis Leary? How so? Saying that smoking pot doesn't lead to other drugs, it leads to carpentry? Perhaps. AcidicVampire in chat says, if you use your 360 as a bong, you will see Yaris. This is possible. This is very possible. Alright, look, look. Don't turn your 360 into a bong. Get it to work again so that you can get new games on it. Although this game is not on the 360, but it's a developer that makes a lot of games for 360. PopCap is giving away a free game. That's right, a free game. It's actually, I believe, going on right now. It's kind of like a St. Patrick's Day promotion. It's going to go through March 24th. The game you can get is Big Money. You can get the game for free on PopCap. So go check it out. Big Money, kind of like the game Poppet, if you've ever played it with the balloons. You're basically trying to make, you know, like four of the same color that touch, and it has a money theme going to it, yeah. It's just like the balloon game if you've ever played it, but kind of like, oh no, don't you click them away in this one. When you see matches of four, you click on it, and then they go away and everything compresses together. I think that's this one. That's how the balloon one is. So there it is. You click on them, and then it compresses together, and you don't want it to go past the top of the screen. I've played this before, like a long time ago, but it's free, so now I can go play it again, unlimited, but I have to get it before the 24th. So check it out. And as Zach Def says in chat, Big Money, Big Money, no whammies, stop! No, it's not that kind of big money, sorry to say. Maybe someday on one of those live. You need to play your gift. I want to get people over and play the pressure. It'll be fun. I have the Press Your Luck DVD game. That's what Dark Sakura's talking about. It'll be fun. Alright. How about some release dates? How about it, Rob? Let's start in the UK with Dark Sakura. Well, there's really, um, most of them are on the 20th. There is a game being released on the 18th, which is The Path on PC, which I know nothing about. Um, then there's some stuff on the 20th. As I said, there's Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on DS, Mad World on Wii, which is beautiful and completely bloodlicious. There's Ready to Rumble Revolution on Wii, Rhapsody a musical- didn't Rhapsody already come out? I don't know. No, Rhapsody a musical adventure on DS, The Last Remnant on PC, The Wheelman on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. And that's it. The US doesn't have much coming out, unfortunately, this week. Starting things off, of course, we have, um, you know, on the DS, and I think this is held over from last week, but World Championship Games, a track and field event, um, it got delayed to, um, Monday. And that's on the DS, also Valkyrie Profile coming in the plume, also coming out on Monday on the DS. Um, Tuesday is when we have most of the stuff coming out, including, um, another DS game, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Also on the DS, Henry Hatsworth in a Puzzling Adventure, which is pretty cool, kind of combines puzzle and platforming there. Um, also on the DS, Mind, Body, and Soul Big World Puzzle Book. Um, on another Nintendo platform, on the Wii, we have Ready the Rumble Revolution, also Provolution Soccer 2009 on the Wii as well. Um, also have Rune Factory Frontier, and some more DS titles. We have on the DS and PSP Scrabble, on PlayStation 2, Sing Star Queen, also on the DS, Suicoden T-Crease, um, Trackmania DS, also on the DS, and on the Wii, Crayola Adventures Colorful World. Wow, that sounds awesome. Not. Awesomely bad. Awesomely bad, yes. Um, let's see, this week on Xbox Live Arcade, we're supposed to be getting Hasbro Family Game Night, also on DS, SBK08, Superbike World Championship. On PC, a few things, The Path, Runes of Magic, Grand Ages Rome, Ether Saga Online, Tom Clancy's Hawks, and Woman's Murder Club, A Darker Shade of Grey, oh, and Men of War. That's it, pretty kind of lame release week, but, oh, and on PSP, how could I forget this, I was actually going to play this, Resistance Retribution. Can't wait to check out the, like, linking stuff on that. Actually, I can't wait to finish Resistance 2, since I haven't really played much of that. Hey, quick question for you, completely random, but since you know about, you know, games that are in demand and all that stuff, um, what's up with the Retro Game Challenge? I tried to go to Best Buy to get it the other day, and they said they had none in stock, and they weren't expecting any more. Is this, is this like a hard to find game now? I guess. It's Atlas, so Atlas puts out their games in very limited quantities, and a lot of these places, you know, think it's going to be too niche of a title, and so they don't bring it in. And then people start asking for it, and then you can't find it. Interesting. I know, because I actually was hearing Bobby say good things about it last week, and he's not the only one, so my other friends are talking about how they enjoyed Retro Game Challenge, so I was actually going to pick it up on the DS, and then I can't find it. Oh well. I'll just get it on Amazon or something, I guess, if I have to. Alright, let's go over to Japanese release dates, and actually also Slow Week in Japan. On the Xbox 360, nothing. On the Playstation 3, MLB 09 The Show is coming out in other Asian regions, not just Japan. It's kind of making an Asia release, so otherwise as far as Japanese only games, nothing. How about the Nintendo Wii? Now you get some stuff for Japan. Darts Wii Deluxe, Monopoly Here and Now the World Edition, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 All Play, and Winter Sports 2009 The Next Challenge, all of those titles coming out on the 19th of March. Checking the handhelds out, actually first I want to mention on the Playstation 2, there's a couple price reductions on the games Naraku no Shiro and Sankokushi X get price reductions on the Playstation 2. As far as the Nintendo DS goes, Dengeki Gakuken Cross of Venus RPG is coming out on March 19th, as well as Gardening Mama makes its Japanese debut on March 19th. Are you interested in Gardening Mama, Dark Sakura? Because I knew you were a big fan of a Cookie Mama. I would rather just cook it and have someone else do my gardening for me. Let's see, also coming out, Kuroshitsuji Phantom and Ghost comes out from Squeenix on the 19th of March, and the Pets series also making its way to Japan. Cats, Dogs, Horses and Monkeys, those are all separate games making their release in Japan. Zookeeper gets a price reduction, that game's been out forever. You finally get that in Japan. Let's take a quick look at the PSP, see if there's anything I want to mention on the PSP. Yeah, Dragon Ball Evolution comes out on the PSP this week in Japan. Yeah, that's gonna suck. A game based on live action Dragon Ball Z, well, Dragon Ball movie. I don't make them, I just report them. Not gonna see it. You can get PSPs now in bright yellow and what they call Spirited Green. Those are some new things that are coming out this week as well. Those actually look pretty hot. Are the PSPs region free? Yes. That green one's really good looking actually. I wouldn't mind one of those. They're region free as far as games go, not UMDs. Although, if you put a custom firmware on there, that's not an issue, so. Tempting. Yes. That's it for release dates. So, let's go back into the gaming news, Dark Sakura. Well, you know, Amazon's been having a new deal now with their game downloads where you can basically buy a game to download for $9.99 or less according to their ad. And a bunch of game developers are not happy about it because they think that their games should be sold for more. So, PopCap and iWin actually pulled a lot of their games off of Amazon saying that it was completely unacceptable. For example, they'd want to put like Jewel Quest for $19.99 and think that $9.99 is way, way too low. That 20 bucks is an acceptable price, 10 bucks is not. So, you can't get those anymore and from what I understand, the rest of the selection is kind of ass. Interesting. Hmm. Oh well. There's a pretty cool update, I guess, possibly in the, I guess, rumored future here for Burnout Paradise. Now you may remember, I think at CES they were showing off a little bit of the 3D technology you know with those special glasses that you can wear and stuff like that. That can be used in say different computer games. I believe they're also showing some of the PS3 games off in it as well like Wipeout HD and stuff like that. Well, one game that may get this upgrade in the future, and this might be something we'll see at GDC, would be Burnout Paradise. And of course, Burnout Paradise, I mean, I love all the upgrades and updates that they're doing to it. It's really awesome. So, adding 3D to it would be pretty awesome as well. And if only they could use those polarized glasses that they hand out in the 3D movies and stuff, because I have a few pairs of those sitting at home. Aren't you supposed to return those as you leave the theater? You don't have to. The fancy IMAX ones you do. Let me put it this way. Well, the fancy IMAX ones I can understand because they're like shutter glasses and stuff like that, but the polarized glasses, they can go fuck themselves because I have to pay for those glasses. I'm keeping that shit, okay? I can understand that. So, you know, I'm not recycling crap because they're just going to put that back in a package and sell it to me again. No, screw it. Not to say that you can't take the glasses out of Disneyland either because they have the Honey I Shrunk the Audience or whatever. You can get the 3D glasses for that. No, they actually have a cast member waiting there for you to dump them off. That's fine. But the Muppet show one's freaking awesome. But I'm saying, you know, if I have to pay for the glasses, like they're like, oh, the glasses are an extra $5, I'm keeping the glasses. That I can understand. So, all right. Well, I guess kind of changing topics here a little bit. Talking about this story out of the UK, there's this campaign called the Change for Life campaign over in the UK. What's interesting about this is it's trying to, I guess you could say it's a campaign, an ad campaign trying to get folks to not play video games, basically insinuating that video games cause obesity, diabetes, cancer and so on and so on. Just all these bad things. And basically trying to get people to go out and about. For instance, let me read the text on one of their ads here. Risk an early death. Do nothing. 9 out of 10 kids risk growing up to have unhealthy amounts of fat in their bodies. Even if you think they look healthy today, adult could bring an early death from heart disease, type 2 diabetes or cancer. So make sure your kids are active for an hour a day. Reduce how much fat they eat. For more advice, visit this website. And what's interesting about this particular ad that I'm reading from in particular is it features a little kid sitting on the couch holding a PlayStation controller in their hand. Like, oh, I'm just sitting here lazy looking, you know, half dead. Yeah. Well, but he definitely looks bored playing PlayStation games, which, you know, there, there are quite a lot of boring PlayStation 3 games are out right now. However, that's not the problem. What's going on here. Sony's pissed about this. And Sony is to the point where, um, they are actually thinking about possibly filing a lawsuit. Apparently the agency who made the ad, the gate, they did not get permission from Sony to use the controller, uh, in the ad. And so it is possible that they're talking about, uh, uh, possibly Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is considering legal action against the folks that made the ad. And here's the thing, you know, yes, kids need to get up off the couch. Kids should not sit and play video games all day. What's there to say that video games aren't actually a healthy thing to incorporate into a lifestyle, you know, just, you know, maybe an hour a day or a couple hours a week. You know, if you limit it in your kid's life, I don't think it's necessarily such a bad thing at all. You know, right. Kind of gets them to think it challenges them, gives them a sense of accomplishment. I think there's a lot of good things, you know, the old hand-eye coordination riff that we all used growing up. Right. I do still think though that kids need to go outside and play. Oh, I absolutely don't get me wrong, but come on, look at this ad risk and early death sitting here playing. I'd be pissed. I'd be as uninteresting as this kid. They're also though not factoring in the fact that there are many people who may be clinically overweight who are actually in better health than, like say that you've got the person who's in their BMI range, correct? Right. And they don't eat properly, they don't exercise, they can't lift much, but you've got the person that maybe you say a little over their BMI, which by the way, BMI is bullshit, you know, are overweight, but yet they go out and, you know, bike, go swimming, do things, are active people and have much better cardiovascular system than the, you know, stupid little anorexic cheerleader type. I mean, you can also have, you know, someone incredibly muscle bound who's the same BMI as someone 300 pounds overweight. I mean, really, it's, you've got to look at the factors of biology, genetics, and more than that. It's, just sitting in front of the couch playing video games all day is not going to make you die. Comments from chat. I have to read chat.orangelaundryradio.com. Xlink says, it's good hand-eye, but so is masturbation. Good point. SHJ100Matt says, go outside and play Dragon's Lair in the backyard. Xbandit says, you can be fat and happy. It's true, you can be fat and happy, but you know, you just got to make sure you're not fat and unhealthy. There's, there's the difference. You know, so you can be a triathlete and, you know, or let's see, you can be a professional bicyclist and get cancer. True. True. You can be a triathlete who gets hit by a car. You know, what does it matter? Then you die an ironic death. Here's the thing is that I think a better ad might be instead of the big text up there that says risk an early death, do just nothing. How about one that says stop using games to babysit your children? That would be an effective ad in my opinion. That, that would be one because the kid looks bored and everything. So how about stop using games to babysit your children? A responsible parent is going to look beyond, you know, there, and this is something that I've had to think of a lot myself lately. If you're going to be a responsible parent, you need to be 100% for your kid, including taking them outside to get them some activity, including telling them, you know, I think you've played enough. You need to go do this now. You've got to set, you know, the, uh, you have to do the things that are good for them, not just the things that are convenient for you. That's an awfully nice way to phrase it as a parent is that, you know, I think you've played enough cause I know my mom would have said, turn it off and go outside. Well, you know what I mean? No, I know what you mean. My mom would be just like, you're not on that thing again, are you? And then I'd go out and play, come back and she'd be playing my Nintendo. Nice. That's how she got her turn. Go outside. It's my turn. That's pretty much it. All right, so we'll see what happens. We'll see if Sony does end up suing over this or not. I'm not sure what's going to end up happening. You know who else will sue? Who? They won't, but speaking of Sony, we have some stuff about nobi nobi boy, um, Takahashi Keita said that there's going to be an offline multiplayer mode on the way and that he wants people to enjoy the game. So they're working on an update. Um, there's, uh, it's, it's all going to be though offline though, specifically offline and, um, they're saying that it should be roughly around the 18th of April. Well, I mean, not boo. I mean, multiplayer is better than none at all, but you know, I wish, you know, it's not like the Sony's not connected to the internet, you know? I know, right? So whatever. Hmm. I don't know. I played that, like I said today, and I still don't get the game. I have yet to check it out. I keep forgetting. And every time I do go on the PlayStation to play, I'm going back to Flower. I hate the camera so bad in the game. The Sony camera? Oh, for Flower? No, in No We Know You. The camera is a pain in the ass. And whatever. Um, so, it's interesting. Um, of course, a lot of people are familiar with GamePro, the magazine. Um, it's still around, surprisingly. Um, well, GamePro is actually going to publish indie games now under their new label, GamePro Labs. And, uh, you may see some of these games coming to XNA, PC, Zune, iPhone, etc. Um, basically, they're going to sort of act as a middleman between indie devs and platform holders. Um, what's also interesting is GamePro is going to announce that they're planning to produce a free custom edition of its magazine for distribution exclusively at 7-Eleven. So when you get your Slurpee, you can get a free copy of your modified GamePro magazine. Is this going to be in addition to their print- the current subscription magazine? Yes, and also, I'd like to add growing in this economy. I'd like to add as a further dip at, um, the crap that is 7-Eleven. You can go pick up your free magazine when you're picking up a game that's broken the street again, you know, because 7-Eleven doesn't- You make it sound like it's an issue. 7-Eleven doesn't hear street dates, nor do I. I know, what's the problem? I thought you were in full support of this. I'm in full support of Slurpees, and if- God damn it, if I became rich, I'm getting a Slurpee machine. I miss vanilla Coke Slurpees. Those were the bomb. What the hell do I have to do to get those to come back? GamePro doing their own game publishing. Do you think we're going to see anything big come out of this? Nope. Or do you think it's just going to be of the caliber of the types of things that come free with the magazine? You know, that would be kind of interesting to have exclusive games for the magazine, you know, just indie developers. I know, I'm surprised these Xbox magazines aren't giving away some of these community games on their discs. That's because they have to give away demos that are already available on Live. Woo! Demos! I can't download- For those three people that are connected to the internet. See, here's the thing. I used to subscribe to Xbox Magazine back when they used to have demos, way before they ever came out, you know, like Saints Row, because that was awesome. Saints Row demo, hell yeah, but now it's like demos for old shit that have been out on Live for a long time now. Yeah, no thanks, I don't need to subscribe to your magazine anymore. I already get a free membership to stupid, well not even technically free, but I get a membership to Game Informer because I have that stupid card at GameStop because, you know, it gives me an extra 10% or whatever. Who cares? It's paid for itself, but hey, I get a magazine out of it, and actually the magazine's not bad, so I'm not buying Xbox Magazine. Well, if you've ever wanted to make your own iPhone game, as a lot of people have been lately, I think the iPhone passed some obscene amount of applications that are now available in the store, like 10,000 apps or something are now available in the store. How many of them are good? Probably 10. But anyhow, here's the thing, is that now any idiot's going to be able to make their own iPhone game. It's a game called GameSalad. Yes, that's right, it's GameSalad, it's this new software that's coming out from Gendai Games. It's going to be something that will help you develop your own iPhone games. Apparently though, it's not just going to stop there. I guess in the future, what have you, it's going to be open to Facebook, and then possibly the Wii and the DS someday. So yeah, GameSalad is coming out of this, I guess they were showing more about this at the South by Southwest festival that's going on right now this weekend. Kind of interesting, you make your own little 2D games, these screenshots I'm looking at, somebody's putting together their own little shooter game. I don't know though, is this just going to be the quality of RPG Maker, or what? I don't know. Don't knock RPG Maker, it's still pretty good actually. But no, it's not going to be any good at all. I mean, RPG Maker's pretty awesome, but I've seen some of these games, like how like Click and Play, there's just so many limitations to it, and I don't know, I think it's just- Well, here's the thing though, it's not just for shooters, like some of the games they say have been made on this that are pretty good. A game called Darkwood that's like a Zelda-ish type of RPG that was made by 3 students in a week's time, and then DRFT, a 2D racing game that's kind of like the original Grand Theft Auto. Yeah, it sounds like everything that Click and Play could have done, because that's the type of stuff you could do in it, and it's just very limited, and yeah, you can make these wonderful little racing games and stuff, but they're just not great. And I hope to God that you can't publish these on the Apple Store, because that's all they want. Let's put out a game-making program so any idiot can create all this crap and then we can pad our numbers on the App Store and use that in our next commercial that, you know- Why not? Any idiot can make a podcast and get it listed on the iTunes Store. Hey, how you doing? Yeah, but iTunes doesn't go, hey, we've got X million podcasts, look at us, we're so awesome. They don't really care. Apple doesn't care about podcasts? Apple doesn't care about a lot of things except getting you to buy their crappy products. Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news. We're almost to the end of part A of the Classic Game of the Week, coming up in just a little bit, we've got a couple more stories for you guys. That we do. In fact, something about Resident Evil 5. There's supposed to be a versus download content and it's supposed to be out for 160 Microsoft points or 250 yen on a Playstation network, which we're probably going to be getting it for twice as much or something like that, but they're basically saying in Japan it's going to be out March 26th, so. Very cool. So there's, of course, we were talking a little bit earlier about exclusives and that kind of stuff and mentioned Bioshock 2. Well, of course, this month in Game Informer, which also goes back to another story, man, we're transitioning from two different stories. Bioshock 2 was the cover story and, of course, they showed, or revealed, I should say, the Big Sister is a new Big Daddy-esque creature that you're going to be fighting against in the game. Now, there are no real details, at least, that have leaked out yet about what exactly you're going to be doing, but the second game, apparently, you will be playing as the first Big Daddy, the original. They'll be kind of a renegade Big Daddy that's actually on the hunt for his own little sister and that you'll be able to take out rival daddies with your hand drill. Plasmid powers, apparently, are going to be making a return as well as some other interesting things. And, apparently, this little sister is looking to kidnap your little sisters as well. And it's very interesting, but, of course, it's going to be an awesome game. Bioshock 1 was really sweet and I can't see that it's going to be any less than that. This game has an awful lot to live up to. Do you think it's going to meet the hype? I think it will. I think they're going to have to do some interesting stuff with it. I thought that it was going to be more above ground and stuff like that. The fact that you're playing as a Big Daddy from the beginning is kind of ehhh. I'm not too sure if I like that idea, but we'll see. Alright, well, hey, let's take a trip back to the past here. I'm not talking about the Classic Game of the Week just yet, but here's the interesting thing is that the Genesis, of course, is a system that's been featured many times in the Classic Game of the Week. Apparently, there is this new kind of like third party Sega Genesis coming out here. Blaze is the company that is producing this. I guess it's kind of like a knockoff of the Genesis that came out kind of later. They're calling it the Mega Drive because I don't think they're actually releasing it here. It's something that is being sold at Play in Britain. It's going for about $53 and with the system comes about 15 games. Sonic and Knuckles, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd, Golden Axe. So all these old school games. And I guess what you start to see is as these consoles age, I guess the patents expire or something like that. And now third party remake these old ass consoles, which is interesting. And the best part about this though, because they did release something before they've done handhelds and that kind of thing. The best part about this though is it does have its own cartridge slot that will play Mega Drive and Genesis games. So not only do you have the 15 that are built in, but you can put in new ones. Yeah. Very cool. Very cool. Alright, well, now what we're going to do, we're going to take a trip back to the past and I don't know if Dark Soccer has picked a Genesis game this week. She might have picked something else. Not a while. Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane and see what the classic game of the week is that all you kids should check out this week by Dark Soccer. Well, the secret, the secret. The game of the week is Secret of Mana, which was known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2. And I picked music for it that is actually some of the overworld music, which is my favorite. Well, I thought it was going to be a little different. The game came out, it was actually developed by Square, which is now Squeenix, and came out on the Super Nintendo and we eventually got it on Virtual Console. It's actually, as I said, Seiken Densetsu 2. The first one was called Seiken Densetsu Final Fantasy Gaiden for the Game Boy, and we got it as Final Fantasy Adventure. It was kind of an interesting little game there, but going back to Secret of Mana, it didn't use the turn based system, it used a real time battle, more like how it was in Zelda, but you also had an AI that you could actually control to be either attacking, defense, or somewhere in the middle, and a second player could come in and play one of your other characters. So it was pretty much a two player RPG. I personally have not tried to do it with the multitap to see if you can do three people, so if anyone has let me know. It just never occurred to me until I was an adult. So the game itself, in the American version, is basically, you're kicked out of town and you have to go and you hook up with a princess and a sprite and you run around trying to get a different, well first of all you get your experience in battle and you level up and you can level up your spells as you, you know, as you attract them. And by the way, the multitap does work. Thought I would mention that. And the virtual console version will let you use three people. But anyway, you have to rescue different elementals and they give you different attacks, different skills, different things that you can do. But the magic is your party's mana power which will increase as the game goes on. So, really it's just you go through different places. You can also get Flammie. You remember Flammie? Yes. The second thing I put on there, Rob, was Flammie's music. Let me queue that up here real quick. The best way I can describe Flammie is like Falcor from The Never Ending Story, really. It's the same concept. You ride on this big white dragon thingy's back and then you can land in different places. But hey, it's mode seven-tastic. So you can go over the background and you can move and the map will move with you and you can land and it's pretty cool. So it's just a cool little game. I think it's funny though, the way that you call them is by doing the little drum with the balls on the string. I forgot what they're called. But anyway, it's super cool. But at the end you get the mana sword and kick ass and game over. So the game was designed by Ishikoichi and was actually released after Final Fantasy 3. They wanted to actually use the system from Final Fantasy 4, but it wouldn't work in the series, so they did it all for Secret of Mana. It was originally going to be an SNES CD add-on, but when they dropped that they just did it all to fit on the cartridge. I actually had one of the faster localization. It only took 30 days to translate the game. And we got it. It was also stated that they were going to bring it out for the Wonderswan Color and they cancelled it when Square decided to tell Bondi WTF, we don't like you anymore. So that's really it. It's been one of the most popular games. It's been considered by Nintendo Power it was number 42 in their top 200 games of all time. And it's one of my favorites. And it's actually because of this that I went nuts trying to find Saikens and Senzu 3 and played the most of it on a fully translated bomb hack. I wish I could find it. It's a very worthwhile game. If you haven't played it, play the hell out of it and then play Saikens and Senzu 3 because it just evolves all the awesome. So go for it. I don't even know why I hadn't reviewed this earlier. Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Secret of Mana. And what a classic game it is. I wonder if they'll ever be highlighting Secret of Evermore. Well, ow, sorry. You know what gave me the idea to do that, Rob? I found my game. What's that? Secret of Mana. Oh, did you? In the box. Ah. With the instruction manual and everything. And then I was just thinking, damn. It's a shame that I'm so attached to this thing. Nice. That would pay for my Disneyland. Right, right. Alright, well we are going to take a break here. We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio coming up, though, in Orange Lounge Radio Part B. So stay tuned. Don't go anywhere. We will be right back. And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March 15th of 2009, where we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night on AllGames.com. All Games Radio, bringing you lots and lots of great gaming shows throughout the week. We're on right after another great gaming show called The Bobby Black Wolf Show, and we run for about three hours, until we're tired and we want to go home, is basically how long we do the show. We have plenty more gaming news to get to in this segment. First, though, I want to kind of give a plug for this. You might remember a few weeks ago, actually it was a couple months ago now at this point, we had Aaron from the Snake 360 development team, or he is the Snake 360 development team, really, all by his little self, was here on the show to talk about his community game, Snake 360. Well, I just got word that now apparently there is a new game called Snake 360 Lite on Xbox Live Marketplace, and it's the same game as pretty much what was up there before, except now it's half the price. Now, of course, since it is half the price, there's a little less features than what you have in the full game, but now I guess you get some two different multiplayer modes now, three single player courses, three difficulty levels, multiples of control schemes, just like in the other game, you still get some of the soundtrack from the same recording, and so on and so on. So, pretty cool, check that out, support independent game development, Snake 360 Lite. Alright, now we're going to get back into some other gaming news, yes, Loki? Yes, we are. Some pretty cool stuff, I don't know, this is kind of weird. Nintendo has addressed complaints that they had not that many games coming out, they're low output of first party titles. Apparently, it says this year, Nintendo seems to be getting some more games coming out, including the equally awaited Punch Out. Of course, they've been having the new play control games and stuff like that, but it says until now, there have been complaints that Nintendo actually makes too many games, or Nintendo dictates too much leadership. I think they're talking about publishers complaining that their games, the first party games seem to be so successful, it's actually overshadowing the third party games, and then also it says that there's also people complaining that Nintendo makes far too few games. And they're like, well, we don't know what to do. So now that they're putting out more games, they're trying to make sure people are going to be happy. The thing though, you ask me, they're not really putting out that many new games. I mean, porting over a game that was on the GameCube that they had sitting in a shelf for quite a long time, some of the Mario Tennis and the Pikmin games and the new Donkey Kong, was it Jungle Beat and that kind of stuff. Those aren't new games. You're just adding stuff to it and you're adding new controls to it. I mean, really, that does not count. Putting old things in new packaging. That doesn't count at all. Excite Bots and Punch Out, that does count because those are brand new. But these new play control games, I'm sorry, I'm getting a little sick of them. And they've just started coming out, but just tell people to stop buying them. But the thing is, that's all that's coming out now. It's like, people are so hungry for Nintendo games, like, oh god, I want a new Pikmin game. Well, now you're going to buy the re-release of Pikmin 1 and 2. I mean, that's fine if you want to play them or if you haven't played them before, but it's kind of encouraging them not to put any effort into it. It's just like, I don't know if you remember back on the Game Boy Advance, when they started porting NES games to it. You know, that was cool, but at the same time, it's like, let's make something new now. Anytime now. GameGuru in our chatroom says Punch Out is very much a remake. It is, but it is adding new characters, and it's not so much, it may be a remake, but it's not a port. It's a Super Nintendo game too, and it's at least kind of redone from the ground up, and there are some new things in it. And it's not a port. It's not like, oh, I took the GameCube game, didn't really change anything to it, and then just poured it over. Now, Pikmin 1 and Mario Power Tennis, they didn't really add anything to it. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, from what I hear, they're adding some additional levels to it. I don't know if it was in the Japanese version or if these are brand new levels, but they're adding something to it. And then Pikmin 2 are supposed to have two different types of Pikmin that weren't originally in the game. So they are adding something to it. But still, it's a port of a game that's been out for a long time now. GS68 in chat asks, where's my new play control Custer's Revenge? That wasn't on the GameCube. It wasn't, but maybe it's a game that he's thinking needs to make a comeback, I don't know. Alright, well look, if you want to look for some new Wii games that actually look kind of interesting, and you want to talk about a remake, I don't know if this is really a remake though. This is like a reinvention completely of the old game Pong. I'm going to actually play a little clip here from the little trailer that we have here in studio, because this actually looks kind of neat. Let me see if I can play a little clip here. It's like a music-based game. It's called Bit.Trip.Beat, and it's by a company called Axis. And it's actually coming out to WiiWare on Monday, and it's like, all these little Pong balls consistently are coming at your little paddle, and you have to bounce them back. And when you do, it makes little beat music, like the 8-bit weapon type of chiptunes music, that's what I was looking for. I guess this game's coming out, it's going to be 600 points. Here's the thing, the controls, you just tilt the control back and forth, tilt the little Wiimote back and forth to make the little paddle go up and down the screen. And the graphics, they're not even 8-bit, they're like Atari 2600, but with these really trippy New Age backgrounds. So it looks kind of neat. I'm actually thinking I have to play this. This should be on the DS. No, I like the idea of only having to pay $6 for this. But this should be on the DS. Who knows, maybe if this does well, it will be. But like, this boss stage looks just like a freakin' regular Breakout or something like that, it's crazy. Trippy. Very trippy. Hence the name, haha. Exactly, so you can check that out, it'll be out on WiiWare on Monday it sounds like. By the time most of you hear this podcast, it'll already be out. ActDeft in chat says, BitTripBeat is basically Pong and Rez's bastard child. Kinda. Kinda. Well, I have bad, bad news. Actually, not really bad news. Hmm, what's that? It's not likely news, but Capcom US is hoping that we get a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which I think would be freakin' fantastic. And I mean, it's got Gatchamon. What else do you need, right? They're saying, it was basically a quote by Christian Svensson, who is the developer, the business developer and strategic planning VP at Capcom, said, do not rule out, do not rule a Western release out. That's all I can say right now. We are still actively working on having that happening. I can't say it's happening definitely. I couldn't give you a time, but as badly as the fans want it, we want to bring it. The problem that they're running into is, what do we all say, licensing. Right? Mm-hmm. Tatsunoko rights are actually split among several companies in the US, whereas of course in Japan, Tatsunoko Pro has all of them. You don't have to worry about it. But here, it's like, you know, whoever had, you know, Gatchamon 2 has Eagle Riders here. You know, there was Battle of the Planets, there was G-Force, you know, for all the Gatchamon franchises. I don't know if we ever got Tekkaban on TV here at all. Some anime companies got the rights to Kachan. Yeah, we had it as it was Technoman over here. But just all those different characters, the ones that were either converted to, you know, tunes that we watched as a kid or in later anime, you know, home releases, you know, different things like that. Or even, you know, people who just thought about bringing it out over here and paid the licensing rights. That does happen. It's gonna be a pain to get everything together, so they're actually gonna have to do a lot of work for us to get the game over here, and it's all down to freakin' licensing. Well, that's not a surprise, but kinda, you know, I think we all, at least I accepted the fact that we probably weren't gonna be getting this game quite some time ago. You know, I wouldn't expect to see this game over here because of the licensing, which is just a darn shame because the game's a lot of fun. You almost just kinda wish, you know, if the Japanese companies created them, they just would release it out here and say, fuck all y'all. These were originally our characters, so I forget it. But I guess, sadly, in a sue-happy world, that's not what can be done. Well, the way that it is is that once Tatsunoko's given up the rights, they have to abide by contract. Yeah, no, I get it. It just sucks. And Tatsunoko Pro I don't think really has any holdings in the US, so it'd be nice. So then they couldn't be sued in a US court. But I guess Capcom could be. But Tatsunoko wouldn't legally be able to give the approval, which they clearly did in Japan, they just would not legally be able to do approval in the United States. No, I know, I get it. It just sucks. That's all. It just sucks. Hmm. So. It's still pretty cool though that might have a chance to actually come out over here. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't bet money on it. Here's what I would bet. If anything, they would just use the engine for something else. You know, like port, new maybe Capcom vs Street Fighter game. That'd be kinda cool, you know, with some new Capcom characters in there and stuff. You know, get a, what's his name, Frank West from Dead Rising in there and stuff as a character. Sadly, I'm not gonna hold my breath. They'd need Gatchaman Fighter. Always. Just Gatchaman. Whatever. And they'd need to make it, for me specifically, and say, because Jamie demanded it, we give you- And it would actually say that in the opening credits. Exactly. We give you Gatchaman the battle. Okay. I would be very gratified as a fangirl. And then you wake up. Yeah, not gonna happen. What is gonna happen though are three more Wii games in the Resident Evil series, including the, it's never gonna be released in the United States, Resident Evil 0, which now is gonna be released in the United States, and of course already out in Japan. However, a new game that will be coming out, Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles, which will be a sequel to the Umbrella Chronicles game. It's gonna be a rail shooter, and is based on the Resident Evil 2 timeline starring Leon and Claire. They're gonna add, I guess, some new co-op stuff and a new evade system, which is supposed to be pretty cool. Then they're also gonna do a Resident Evil remake that's gonna be coming out as well, titled, I guess, Resident Evil Classics. And, not sure if that's gonna be kinda like a new play control game or something like that, but that's gonna be, I guess, coming out for a $30 price point. The studio is haunted. We're having the attack of the random beeping noise. Here, just give that to me. I'll turn that off. Live radio, everybody. It's my sensor bar. Batteries are going out. Sorry about that, guys. It's warning you that it's turning off. We had random beeping going on in the studio, and it was from the Wii that Loki was playing during the breaks there, showing Madworld on Justintv. The wireless bar was beeping. That was crazy. I think the timer, I had set it to a two-hour timer, so I think it was turning off. Okay, sorry about the crazy dead air there, but live radio, that happens. Yeah, so I'm sorry. Resident Evil rail shooter is coming out. And it makes me think about, you know, Silent Hill had a rail shooter that hit arcades and what have you, so it's like all these scary games are getting shooters. You know what scary thing I wanna see get turned into a shooter, though? Hot girls in scary places. Have you seen this show on E? I thought you were gonna say showgirls. No. That is scary in itself, but have you seen this on E? It's a show on E, and they put hot girls and they put them in scary places, and they have to spend the night in abandoned hospitals and stuff. What, like, you know, next to nerdy guys or something? No, they have to do all these gross tasks and they get money and stuff like that, you know, if they're able to actually... Hot girls in scary places, yes. That's the game they need that's a rail shooter of a completely different kind. Alright. Anyhow, forget it. Moving on. More news on Excitebots. It seems like every week we have new news on Excitebots, but here's the interesting thing about Excitebots. Apparently now the blogs are reporting that Super Sandwich is a move that you can have in the game, and that's from this giant screenshot coming from the game there. Super Sandwich, five stars. It's basically, what they've done is they've have a bunch of different things that are going on during the races, like, you know, you'll have to collect parts of a sandwich and then when you collect them you have Super Sandwich. You know, it was funny, remember? I don't know if you remember when Christopher used to, like, kind of sing the different, like, achievements that he got in there. He was like, Super Tree Run! So that's what I pictured when I saw that. I was, like, picturing him singing Super Sandwich. Nice. Which would be funny. Sadly you will not be having an actual sandwich, which is most unfortunate if you ask me. The game looks crazy and Nelly keeps asking me why it's coming out, so. And we don't know, right? Or is it... Uh, 20. 22nd or 20th of April? Yeah. Oh. Alright. Not too far out. Not too far out. Hey, it's in time for a birthday present. For me! It's always got to be about you now, doesn't it? Yes, it always must be about me. I have to have the show's ego after all. Anyway, um, how about something related to Namco, maybe? Okay. Well, Namco is actually registered Excalibur as a trademark. They're not really saying much about it, but it actually has an ESRB listing some achievements revealed. The, like I said, the registered trademark. And so it's there. Namco Bandai is releasing Excalibur. So, of course the theory is that, you know, it's about King Arthur, but maybe it's another in the Soulcalibur family? Or maybe a fighting game using the same engine? Or a remake of that old game Excalibur 2555 AD? I have a feeling that whatever it is, it's going to be lame and disappointing. It's going to be about Pac-Man! Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. No, that's Namco for you. It's either going to be really awesome or really lame. And it's usually nothing in between, so. I'm voting really lame. I don't know. Without a screenshot, nothing? I mean, this could be anything. It could be a role-playing game. Who knows? Nothing. It sounds a little bit like Soulcalibur, but you know, Excalibur is also an old, you know, legend and all that stuff. It may have nothing to do with Soulcalibur. Excalibur is the storyline based on fighters that have dropped out of the Soulcalibur series and now have to find real daytime jobs, including working faster at restaurants. I get it. Excalibur. Ha ha. You're funny. What a fun guy. Ha ha ha. Or, or it's a fighting game featuring all the exes in the relationship. Alright, I think now's a good time to just go to the next story. I'll stop now. We do know what this game is though. We Rock Drum King. It's a brand new drumming game for the Wii. Of course, not using any actual peripherals other than the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, or possibly two remotes if you have those. What it does have though is a pretty cool song list. And the track list was revealed this week, including some stuff that you would not normally see in a music game like this. Now of course you've got classic rock songs like We Will Rock You by Queen, The Final Countdown by Europe. You've got some kind of alternative stuff, Song 2 by Blur. Then some other stuff that they've thrown in there as well. Feel Good Ink by Gorillaz. But one of the weird ones though that was in there, they had Organ Donor, the instrumental version by DJ Shadow. You normally wouldn't see that kind of in like a rock game like this. Some other songs that are in there as well. They have All Star by Smash Mouth. No One Knows by the Queens of the Stone Age. The Takeover, The Break's Over by Fall Out Boy. Can't Stand Losing You by the Police. Spoon Man by Soundgarden. And Click Click Boom by Saliva, as featured in numerous movie trailers. You know, I was still tempted to get Rock Revolution this week. It's only 20 bucks. There's tons of them sitting on the shelf. I'm almost thinking it's going to drop to $9.99 before too long. It won't drop officially to $9.99, but just let's sit there and fester a while and it's eventually going to drop down. So bad, they actually cancelled the Wii version. Ouch. Ouch. Because that was actually supposedly slated for April, still coming out at $50 retail. I'm like, yeah, no one's gonna buy that. Wow. So, yeah, they just cancelled it. Wow. I wonder if there's sales figures on how much that game actually sold. Oh, I'm sure there are. In fact, I have an idea where to look. Alright, well, while you do that, let me talk about some other games that aren't necessarily just there to be sold. It's actually kind of neat. This is over in Japan. There's a Nintendo game seminar program, and if you're a student of this, you get to make your own DS game, basically, as a part of the program. Well, Nintendo's actually taken these games that were created, and now they're available at DS download stations throughout Japan. And you can also get them through the Wii Nintendo channel. There's four games available. One of them is a mic controlled game in which you blow to kind of create air that sends stars up in the sky. Another one is where you are a voice artist that reads lines, and then when they're played back, they're given by like a weird character on screen, a random one or something. Another one is an action game where you move around and you pose, but I'm not sure exactly how that's done because they didn't say these were for the DSi, although, you know, I'm sure these will show up on the DSi, you know, eventually. Sure, if they can charge like two bucks for them, why not? And then the last one is a game about making faces. You shape weird things on these heads that don't have bodies and etc. So, but it's just kind of cool, you know, despite the fact that the games all sound like little one-trick ponies, it's kind of cool that, you know, they have this program where students can make these games over in Japan and, you know, not just that, but now they have kind of a way to get it out there. It's almost kind of like a little bit XNA-ish, so I don't know if that's something maybe this is a sign that Nintendo might use the DSi download service for this or some of their other distribution channels, but that is kind of an interesting thought, right? Yeah, although it could just be a bunch of crapware, I don't know. Okay, I've got the sales figures on Rock Revolution. Alright, can you source them or...? Yes, these are coming from VGcharts.com, and this is up-to-date sales figures. Although they have sales figures for Wii version of Rock Revolution, I guess it never came out over here, but whatever. 0.5 million copies were sold for the Xbox 360 version. That is the highest of the three. That's not bad, that's a half million, right? 0.5 million, or 0.05? 0.05 million. Oh, so 50,000. 50,000. And that is the best one out of all three versions. The PS3 version sold 0.02 million copies, or 20,000, and then finally the DS version only sold 10,000 copies. Youch. Well, that's sad because the DS version seemed like the only one that made sense out of the bunch. But whatever. Alright, well thanks for looking that up for me. Alright, well, now we're going to get to the part of the show where you can always send us some questions and have them answered here live on air. It's the mailbag segment every week you guys send us emails. Mailbag at orangelauncher.com and we read our favorites live on air and respond to them. DarkSira, did we actually get some emails this week? I know you had to clean out the spam. Amongst the spam, yeah, really. Um, we got one from Cheeseburger. Aight. Dongle. It made me giggle. Smack. Inside, in a painful way. Did we get any emails of substance? Yes. Alright. Um, first of all, this is, it says Dear Sea Wow and Wow Bar and Dark Sakura Sky and Loki. So this is a multiple email. First, where, um, are my shows and, two, boy do I have a slew of reviews for you. Okay. Alright, first, um, Tony Hawk's Project 8, another Tony Hawk title for the PSP, but this time around it is a bit more challenging. No auto-kick. The story is cheesy as always. But anyways it's awesome and if you are a skater, wanna be by this. I'm sorry I really can't read this. Yeah, I'm looking at this, it looks like it was written on a PSP. I'm going to try. Alright. Okay, I'm, I'm going to translate into English, okay? Will that be fine? Okay, Wipeout Pure. A lot of us, uh, kids who own a DS and own a GBA, um, know of F-Zero and GX. They have not released anything for a long time and I own a PSP. I thought that it would be a good idea. Instead, it was, and I'll tell you it was more of a challenge than F-Zero. GTA Liberty City, okay. I know you're thinking what a 15 year old is doing with a GTA game. I bought it on Amazon using my debit card and got it a few weeks. I popped it in and I instantly love it. The custom soundtrack stuff takes some work, but once you do it, it's awesome. Killing police from my safe house with a sniper rifle and racking up a six star rating is so fun. Definitely recommend it to a first time PSP buyer. Lords of Dogtown, I love skateboarding and surfing stuff. This movie combined a little bit of both with a story about Jay Adams, Tony Alva, and Stacy Peralta. Okay. Um, alright, last thing. I have one question. Have you guys ever heard of Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System or the Neo Geo CD King of Fighters is Better Than Street Fighter? Peace out, DS lover. Okay. First of all, I own, um, a Neo Geo and I, um, I have a Neo Geo CD as well and I have, um, a Neo Geo pocket color and a Neo Geo pocket. Um, so I'm really not sure which one you're asking about, but King of Fighters, um, it really depends on what you're into. I love the King of Fighters series. I mean, talk about your cheap bitches and hard to pull off attacks. I mean, Street Fighter's a little bit more gratifying to play, but King of Fighters is just a little bit more, sometimes there's a bit more of a fun factor involved with the King of Fighters games. And I do have to say that if you've got it on the Neo Geo, you've got it arcade perfect and you have also paid for it. So that's all I can say about that. Rob? Um, you know, yeah, King of Fighters is sort of like an evolution of, uh, Fatal Fury and King, um, Art of Fighting in those games. And it's, it's okay. Like it's not something I really can usually tolerate long-term though, the SNK games, but they do have that whole, like, you know, foreground and background thing, which is kind of what made them famous. But, um, that was just, um, Fatal Fury. I don't, oh, was it just Fatal Fury? I thought King of Fighters had it too. My bad. Did Art of Fighting have it? No, I think just Fatal Fury. No, Art of Fighting had the weird zoom in and out thing. That was our fighting did it too. The first one did at least. So it was Fatal Fury that had the background foreground. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, it's, it's, it's different and worth the play, but it, I don't think it's necessarily better. Does that make sense? But I love Capcom versus SNK. That's one of my favorite fighters right there. So Matt, what's your preference Street Fighter or King of Fighting? King of Fighters. Do you have a preference, Loki? Ron Street Fighter versus King of Fighters? No. You hate them all? Not hate, but I just don't really care. I will tell you this. Any of the King of Fighters games on Saturn have a bitch of a load time. Seriously. In between rounds. Load time. So, next email. Um, hi all. I was just wondering if it was possible for you guys to create a widget for Samsung phones for your podcast, as I would love to be able to listen to you on the go and download your shows wherever I am. Thanks Simil. Um, I've not even heard of the Samsung phones widget thing. That's not something I'm familiar with. Send us more information on how to make one. If it's just used doing a simple website or something, I'm sure we can figure it out if it involves programming like an iPhone application. Well, I don't know so much about that. Um, if it's something you can connect to iTunes, I don't know if your phone, I don't know because there's a lot of Samsung phones. Um, if your phone, my old phone was a Samsung and if it has a memory card, like my old one, you can put your own songs or your own music on it basically. Um, you should be able to just sync it up with iTunes and download our podcast on iTunes and do it that way. That's the best thing I can think of. If all fails, we can look in to see what that is. Yeah, if it's easy enough, why not? Um, we also got one, um, these are actually put in, that last one and this one that I'm about to actually put in through the website. Cool. So that's pretty cool. Um, first of all, the catch thing you got here is fucking terrible. Okay. Um, I got it wrong because it's really confusing and erased my whole goddamn message. Um, I don't really think that's the fault of the program. Um, anyway, I was just wondering why the show takes so long to go up now. It used to go up the day after recording. Do not take this as a complaint. I am just curious. Um, just because we, my set up here changed and I have two computers now that I have to go back and forth between and then also this week I was on a work trip. So it's just, I try to do it as I can. Other people are offering to help make the process go faster. So we'll hopefully get on that. So sorry. Last email and actually, you know what, I'm going to save this one for a last minute story, Rob. Okay. But I am going to go ahead and credit the story to, um, well they didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say, um, Nigel, thank you. All right. And it will be one of our last minute stories. Congrats. You have contributed to the show. All right. Level up. The winner is you. Here's a no prize. All right. If you want to send us emails, mailbag orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send them to. Let's get back into some gaming news. Loki. Yes. Um, so there's some really neat download content that's going to be coming out very soon for F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin. It's called the Toy Soldiers download content. And what it is is it's a few multiplayer maps that they're adding in, but what's kind of neat about it is it's all done from the perspective that you're small little toy soldiers fighting in these giant areas. So for example, some of the maps that they have, they have, um, you know, a hospital room that you'll actually fight around in. They have a playground. And then finally, one that Jamie, I think, will like. They have one that you fight inside of a pinball machine. Sweet! Um, so yeah. Very cool. Kind of a unique, you know, twist to the whole multiplayer stuff. And I'm glad that they're actually kind of having a little bit of fun with it. But, um, looks pretty sweet. I have to say that the pinball machine looks the best out of all of them. Now only if the giant, you know, metal balls rolling around in there too. That'd be cool. Hmm. But, um, no word on when exactly these will be available. Oh, I guess it'll be in April and it will be free. So that's awesome. Free stuff is always welcome. That's the best kind of download content is free. Well, a new trademark has been filed this week. Sing Hero is the trademark. Of course, you know, that was by Activision and Blizzard, the folks behind Guitar Hero and DJ Hero. Apparently now Sing Hero has been patented. Um, what do you think? Is this going to be their version of Sing Star or Karaoke Revolution or Milk of a Hero franchise? Mm hmm. Uh, although I will say though, keep in mind this company also trademarked Drum Villain and I don't think that ever happened. No. So just because they trademarked it doesn't mean the game is actually going to happen. Yeah, but they also could mean just because, you know, they trademarked Drum Villain, maybe they just rolled that into Guitar Hero World Tour. But Singing is in Guitar Hero World Tour, so I'm not sure why they are going to have this whole separate game. Well, maybe this is going to have more pop music. That could be. Oh boy. Well, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear stories like this, I can just hear the sounds of the Guitar Hero franchise being milked even more and that's like after seeing the arcade game this week and everything and it's just like, I'm starting to get pretty sick of all this stuff and it just makes me angsty because, you know, it used to be such a good game, but now it's just getting, like beating a dead horse. So I get angsty and that's why the FUs of the week happen. I have a couple of FUs, but one of them is a very big, very major one and it's directed towards my body for reasons that I choose not to disclose publicly at this time, but certain people know what I'm talking about. And the second one goes towards a lack of tact. I'm dead. Loki! Happy to Burger King for burning my fries. I have never, honestly I'd expect this kind of thing from McDonald's because they fuck up their fries more times than not, but Burger King, come on man, your fries are usually pretty tasteless and they're fixed by ketchup, but these fries were burnt. I mean, they were brown. Oh, and the other thing too, if you ask me if I want ketchup with my fries, don't just not give me ketchup. Don't ask me the question and just say, oh, here's no ketchup for you. You'd like some ketchup, wouldn't you? But I'm not giving you any. I'm not giving you any. So F you to minimum wage Burger King workers. Well, geez, and as GS68 in chat says, poor, poor Loki's fries. I don't really have anything that major this week. I guess two F yous. One F you goes to jet lag because that sucks and my sleep has been all screwed up like for the past four days because of it. I was in Washington DC this week, by the way, just for a few days. If you were following me on Twitter, you probably saw some of that video. Otherwise my only other F you would go to the fact that we have no Dunkin Donuts here in California, at least in NorCal. And that's sad because I fricking love their coffee. But I actually, I actually brought back a Dunkin Donut for my roommate on the plane from Texas because I always gush about, you know, Dunkin Donuts, even though the donuts, the donuts are only okay. Like to me, I'm not as huge on the donut. It's the coffee. I love the coffee. They're not bad. If my five year old memory serves me right. They're not bad at all. So that's really it. Those are my not so serious F yous of the week, but that's what I've got. I guess the jet, the jet lag one's actually pretty serious. That really was annoying. I did want to say though about a Sing Hero. I wanted to read some comments here in chat about that because I thought one of these in particular was pretty good. Game Guru, I believe said that they might just be trying to protect their trademark. I think it's just protecting trademarks says Game Guru about Sing Hero. And that could be the case. Do you think they're just trying to trademark the name so nobody else tries to use it? That could be. Maybe. I hope that's the case. If that's the case, then I remember a Game Guru also says, I always remember that Dunkin Donut cereal. Me too. Hmm. I actually remember that too. They sold that here too. And they don't have Dunkin Donuts. Oh, whatever. Hit stun says F you Sky. You have arcades with Street Fighter four and we don't. I do. Oh, I guess here in California. Yeah. I just haven't driven to them. Not around us. Not here in SAC, but we do have the Guitar Hero arcade now and they have Mario Kart too, which I didn't check out, but they have that. I thought that would be fun. You can go play it. Yeah, but I don't know. I didn't really care for Mario Kart arcade. It was kind of lame. It was, but maybe the sequel has fixed some things. You never know. No doubt it. All right, let's get into another story. They need more F-Zero GX. They do need more F-Zero GX. Well, there is another interesting thing. You know how all these Lego games been coming out? There's more. More, more, more. Which means people must be buying all the ones that are out there now. You know what though? They're doing it for a good reason because they are pretty damn fun. But once it's sort of a late franchise now, they're doing a Harry Potter Lego. It's never too late. I'm not saying what exactly it's going to be, but maybe it's going to be a walk through some of the other books. And then there is a Lego Indiana Jones 2 The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. As long as you don't have the fucking ending crap in it. God damn it. And they're also pitching to Peter Jackson for a game based off of the upcoming Hobbit movie. Lego Hobbits? Lego Hobbits. I totally saw the whole Harry Potter thing coming out. After all, they do have the Lego Harry Potter toys. And Lego Indiana Jones 2 or whatever they're going to be doing. I love Lego Hobbit. As much as the fourth movie sucked, the first game really, really sold well for them and still continues to sell well for them. I'm not surprised at one bit. But basing your game, I would have to guess it would probably be the original game plus the new stuff as well. I don't know. They're kind of fun. I mean, I understand why they're coming out. It's not like one of these games I look at and go, WTF? Why are we getting this? But I get this. So it's not really a surprise at all. And you've been speculating, Loki, for quite some time that the Harry Potter game is going to be the next Lego thing. Of course. This is no surprise at all. If they've got a toy for it, they're going to make a game for it. Now, if you see like all of a sudden Lego Halo, you know, stuffed toys coming out, then you better believe that there's going to be a Lego Halo game at some point. But otherwise it's an April Fools joke. Yes, otherwise it's an April Fools joke. Fair enough. I wouldn't be surprised if we see another Lego Batman game because that's something that they can keep adding to and basically have unlimited content for because they're not basing off movies. So that's a problem basing stuff off movies. They don't make any more movies. You have no more games. Another comment from Game Guru in chat. Unfortunately, Lego Prince of Persia will likely be next when the toys come out. Will it though? Because they rebooted the Prince of Persia franchise recently. Won't they make this sequel in that kind of way? I don't know if they'll do a Lego Prince of Persia game. The problem being is that it's a Warner Brothers own franchise. Well, the Lego Star Wars stuff that was LucasArts, but you know, basically they're doing Warner Brothers stuff. So, maybe. I mean, if they do, if the movie comes out and it's really popular and stuff and everyone's interested in it, I don't know if they're really going to do it. It would all depend on how many toys come out and how well the toys do. Rice Princess in chat says, I love Lego games. I love Harry Potter games. The two combined would make my head asplode. Let's see. Gio Vaidya says, Lego doesn't sell the HP sets anymore. You can't even get the sets off Lego.com. That's true. Hmm. Interesting. Dark Tetsuya says, still waiting on Lego Watchmen. Yeah, I don't know about that one. Will it come complete with a detachable penis? For Dr. Manhattan. Special soundtrack by King Missile. No, he'll have, he'll have his little like, you know, molecular underpants, which I did not understand because, you know, they, he could wear underpants but he didn't and he doesn't really exist. I never saw the movie. The whole point was that he's detached from humanity and humanity's standard so it doesn't matter to him if he's dressed or not. Because, I mean, seriously, if you think about it, one of the Viet Cong will be really scared of a giant glowing blue penis that's coming towards them. I mean, you know why? I am so down with Dr. Manhattan. He was wearing his black pants. Exactly, that's what I'm saying. He should have just been buck wild there. I mean, I'm just going to do the show naked from now on. I agree with what Dr. Manhattan said. Really, it doesn't matter, you know, no amount of blue penis makes that movie any good, so, oh well. Sad trombone. Sad trombone, yes, very much so. Something that's not so sad though is the popularity of Call of Duty 4. It has reached 15 million online players now, which is no surprise for anybody that plays Call of Duty 4 and of course, you know, this will be good for the new Call of Duty game that's scheduled to come out this year later, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. So, that should do just as well, since it's going to be Infinity Ward again, because everyone knows that Treyarch sucks. I know a lot of people who play Call of Duty 4. This number doesn't surprise me one bit. No. Well, as if there weren't enough people that were going to be lining up to buy the new Beatles Rock Band game. I'm not lining up to buy this game. Well, you're one of not many, because there's a lot of people who are very interested in this game. Apparently though, Danny Harrison, that would be the son of George Harrison, one of the Beatles who passed away a few years ago, he was interviewed by Billboard recently, and they were talking about the Beatles Rock Band game. Apparently, what Danny said is that, or it might be Donnie, sorry, it's going to come with some new material, stuff that has never been heard and never released. Huh. That could be very interesting. So that, I mean, as if this game wasn't going to sell to the Beatles collectors already, imagine if this game has never before heard Beatles stuff. I couldn't believe that anything like that still exists, to be honest, but there you go. Apparently, by the way, Donnie, who's the son of, of course, George Harrison, he's been a big part of actually trying to get the Beatles Rock Band to happen. He's in a band of his own who has an album coming out this month. He actually took the project to Apple and sort of convinced everyone, because of course, not Apple as in the iPhone people, but Apple Music, right, and convinced everyone to sort of have a presentation. The game has been in the making for two years. They say it's historically accurate, a real headache, but it's the most enjoyable work that he's been a part of apparently. So it sounds like it could be interesting. Could be. 9-9-0-9 is when this game's coming out. It's pretty hard to forget that release date. Well, hey, all we have to do is remember Dreamcast. Or that. Yep. Which, oh, you know, I forgot to mention in the gaming week, we actually did bust out the Dreamcast and go through some Sonic Adventure. Nice. Yeah. All of our VMUs still work. Oh my gosh. We have all of our Samba files too. So, here's some other news. You know, Wallace and Gromit, still out there. There is actually a game coming out on March 24th with a demo on the 16th. Telltale Games is putting this out. But it's part of, as far as I'm aware, the episodic Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures. So, hey, keep your eyes open for it. And there's also gonna be another Strong Bad game. If you pre-order Wallace and Gromit, you'll get a full episode of actually Sam and Max and Strong Bad. So there you go. That's pretty cool. Nice. Nice little bonus there. I like full games as bonuses. That's a good deal. Definitely. Now this is kind of not new to the MMO scene, but Final Fantasy XI has finally jumped on board, much like the Blizzard Authenticator. They now have something very similar to that that will generate random passcodes every few minutes, I guess. It's the Final Fantasy XI security token. And, of course, the constantly changing login passwords will apparently protect your account from hackers. And the only thing, though, is they haven't released a price for it yet. But it will come with some in-game exclusive items when you purchase this token. Huh. Okay. So you get special stuff in the actual game? Yes. You get, like, stuff in the game. Hm. Nah, I'm still not interested in going back. Sorry. Alright. One more story for you guys, then we're gonna open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Oh, I was gonna, real quickly, I was gonna mention the Van Deal Collection. Yeah, $14.99 now. Oh my gosh, on Xbox 360? And Windows. Wow, they're really trying to get new crack addicts on that game, because, you know, you pay that once, they might as well just give the game away, because you get 30 days for free with that, and $14.99 is how much it costs a month, right? Yeah. I'm surprised they haven't gone the route of just doing a downloadable demo, or have they, and I just missed that. I don't know. Maybe they did, and I might have missed that. Alright, look, one more story for you guys, completely different side note here, but something also to kind of take a note. Here's the thing. This guy from a Yale University, he's a Yale University student, so you know he's smart. His name is Jesse Meiman. Or is connected. Yeah, could be. There's a report in the Cincinnati Enquirer that Jesse's a little pissed off, because he flew US Airways, and he was flying them in December from Connecticut to Ohio, and they basically lost his Xbox 360. He went to pick up his luggage after he landed, and he noticed that everything was there except for the Xbox 360 and all the accompanying components, so I'm assuming he believes that it was theft. His suit says after that that he got weeks of an unconscionable runaround, so you know what happened next, right? He's suing them. He's suing US Airways for a million dollars for the loss of the Xbox. That apparently is the maximal amount allowable by law. One million dollars is what he's suing for. He says that thing was his DVD player. He's a film studies major. I don't know why you're using the Xbox 360 issue. Well, I guess I can see that. Don't you have a Blu-ray player? Upscale on the HD, right? I guess. But anyway, here's the thing. He wants the airline to pay him $1,700 for the loss of the gaming system because apparently he probably had his own editions on it. I don't know. And for non-economic distress of at least $25,000, but he's seeking the maximum, one million. Go figure. I don't know exactly how that works. But here's the thing. US Air would like to point out their policy state that the federal loss limits are capped out at $3,300 per bag, and the airline's luggage policy excludes liability for electronics. So something you might want to think about before you take these expensive electronics online. But if that specific thing is missing, then it's clearly a case of theft. Yeah. I could see if maybe he, you know, and the other thing they could do too is they have his bag, you know, they have it scaled in there, they know what the weight of the bag was, and then when the bag gets to wherever they should have scaled it again, oh, there's a clear difference in weight in the bag. I mean, those Xbox 360s weigh like 15 pounds, you know. Obviously they stole it. I mean, there's no way that it didn't break, you know, during the flight, which, you know, that I don't see really being the airline's fault. I mean, but the fact that it was stolen is a little different. But at that same time, he should only get compensated for the replacement of the system. Not a million dollars, not even $3,300. Some comments from chat, because of course you know the chat is interested in this. SSJ100Matt says, I always bring my console on the plane with me or not at all. True, he could have brought it in just to carry on, right, if it was that important. Dekeman says, if it was broken, yes, but it was stolen. If you ask for a million, though, suddenly a settlement of $500,000 is looking pretty good. So maybe this guy's just trying to highball it, I don't know. You just try to highball it. Gripper01 says, God help Microsoft if it ever red rings. What a good point. So, alright. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to open up the Skype line, take a couple of calls. Probably not too many tonight, because we are running a little long tonight, but we also want to get to last minute stories here in just a little bit, and all that fun stuff. So, go ahead and give us a call now. We do have a call, we'll go to that. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? It's GS68. Hey, GS68, what's on your mind? Hold on. Okay, I'll wait. I got Gradius Rebirth this week. What? I got Gradius Rebirth this week. It came out this Monday, much to my surprise. Oh, Gradius 3, tell us, wait, Gradius Rebirth or Gradius 3? Rebirth. Ooh, tell us a little bit about Gradius Rebirth. I'm going to put you on with Loki here, I got to take care of something in the studio. Alright, then. So, tell us about the game, what do you think of it? Yeah, basically, it's a new Gradius title, and it looks more like a 16-bit or 32-bit Gradius game, kind of like Gradius for your, a bit like Gradius Gaiden, and it's more of a remix of older Gradius games rather than a completely new title. I'm watching a replay of myself right now, and my replay is on stage 2, which looks like a level from the MSX and MSX game. Okay. Sounds pretty cool. But, yeah, it's only five stages, though. For 1,000 waypoints, that might turn off a few players, but as a result, Gradius 3, I just had to get in the game. And one of my favorite things is on stage 1, there are two enemies, and it destroys either one first, you can change the entire stage depending on which enemies are, like, if you don't destroy either, the stage continues as normal, but if you destroy the top enemy, the stage becomes frozen. If you destroy the bottom enemy, all the units in the stage become active and the stage gets harder. Huh. That's kind of neat. Yeah. And then, looking at the weaponry sort of game, you have the usual Gradius title, which is like regular missile and double and laser, and then you have another one where you have a bomb attack, and then a twin laser that's weaker than the, it's not as powerful as the regular laser, but it shoots faster, and then there's two unlockable setups that are more or less for more challenging players, I guess. Hmm. Well, that was pretty cool. I was actually kind of thinking of checking this out, I just haven't gotten a chance to download it yet, that and that new one that's coming out on Monday here, Bit Trip, or was it Bit Trip Beat or whatever, it looks pretty awesome. But hopefully, you know, I know they've been probably a little bit inspired by the Mega Man 9 stuff, so hopefully we see more of these retro remakes that aren't exactly, you know, retro, I guess. That's kind of cool. It still kind of feels like a new Gradius to me, at least. It was Mega Man 9, it felt like it was playing an old NES game. Yeah. You know, I always... Yeah, because it got, for a game that some say looks like 16-bit, the graphics are a little, on the more colorful side. Hmm. I hope they bring some of this stuff out, you know, I can see you make, they should do a Gradius collection on like DS or something, and have this in there. They have a Gradius collection on PSP in Japan. I know, but they, well they have it here too, but they all have... They have a Parodius collection. But they need it on DS as well. I'll use Salamander collection, but the fact that it's my old PSP has a crappy D-pad, it's turning me off from it. Hmm. And I don't want to get a new PSP, because then I'll have to restart my DKMax save files, because they're locked at a current PSP. Yeah. Well, cool. Is there any other WiiWare games you're looking forward to checking out? Um, don't think so. I have a few favorites that I want to buy. I have a few older games that I've been wanting to buy. Cool. So, crisis averted? I guess. Oh, no, we have Rob trying to find his microphone. Yes, we're back to normal, sorry, but I'm sorry I missed the review, but let me just quickly ask for a summary. Is it worth breaking my boycott over? Hmm. It's certainly not the best... Well, it depends on what game is enough to make you break your boycott. I mean, there's more of a game for hardcore Gradius fans, like, I mean, most people feel like it's part of the fact that it's only five stages, and it doesn't really add much to the series. Hmm. Well, yeah, I know, and there's some comments from chat, like GameGuru says, Final Fantasy IV, the after years will be cool as well, and yeah, those are other types of games I'm looking forward to, so I just hope Nintendo will fix their freaking storage problems sooner rather than later, because, you know, even I admit my boycott is getting stupid. I'd like Defender Castle to get this game. We'll see, we'll see. I do love Defender Castle, though. Alright, we're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for the review. Sorry I wasn't here to hear it all. Alright. Alright. Yeah, it's cool. Later. Alright, yeah. We had, like, an insect outbreak here in studio, because a piece of my sandwich fell on the ground, so all the ants rose up from the ground and were like, rah! They rise from the grave. They rise from your grave, and so they all decided to, yeah, have a piece of that. I thought it was cute how you took care of it. Well, I took care of it right away, right? Alright, let's take a couple more calls here tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this? Hey, that was pretty quick. It's me, Ranma. Hi, Ranma. Hey, what's up, everyone? Not much. We're ant-free now. What's up? I just want you guys to know that I took one for the team two weeks ago, and I want some type of compensation for it. Oh, dear. What's this about? We don't have compensation. We don't get compensated, so this has got to be good. I actually sat there and watched Street Fighter, The Legend of Chun-Li. Hey, no one made you do that. We warned you in advance. Yeah, that's right. We told everybody that was gonna be a pretty shitty movie. See, the fact of the matter is I didn't even pay for it. I went and downloaded it, because I said I am not spending $1,125 on this piece of crap. Not that we would usually advocate piracy, but maybe in that case it'll be okay. Yeah. I mean, they made the movie a little bit too realistic, and I don't care if I give spoilers or not, because that's how bad this movie was. Alright. Number one. Bison should not be walking around in a mustache and a goatee. Okay. Number two. Vega's mask should not look like a cross between Vader and Shy Guy. Ew. Number three. In the fight sequence in the club, Chun-Li could have at least had some type of blue dress or something to signify her traditional outfit, you know? And how the hell does she have injuries on her when you didn't look like she had any in the movie when she was fighting? I don't know. Not for nothing, I'll say this. After seeing this movie, the original Street Fighter is ten times better, and I am so looking forward to Dragon Ball Evolution after this. I don't know, it doesn't look, well, Dragon Ball Evolution doesn't look as bad. Pretty much. I'm just saying, I think after seeing this, that's gonna be a lot better. Maybe he could do both in one day, and then if you watch them back-to-back and you watch this first one that's really craptacular, the second one won't seem so bad. Do you think it's a shoo-in to win all the Razzie awards next year? No, I don't think it's that bad. Now if U.A. Boyle had anything to do with it, by default, it would. Okay. Do you think U.A. Boyle makes better movies than this? I can make better movies than this, and I have an amateur digital camcorder I got from Joe Dea that I'm borrowing. Well, congratulations. My sister, who is graduating from Hofstra as a degree in Filming, she could do something better than this. I've seen her do better work than this, you know? Well, every actor, every director usually has a stinker somewhere in their career, so what can you do? I know, I know, and it does help the fact that my roommate is a big Chun-Li fan, and I warned him, so, yeah. Well, you know, we all told you it would suck, and I have yet to hear anybody say it's good. I want to hear a good review on this movie. Has Rotten Tomatoes, is it zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes? I think it is, somebody just linked Rotten Tomatoes there in chat, I'm gonna look at this, see if it still has a zero percent from all the critics out there. I don't wanna see your stupid ad, come on. I'm skipping the ad right now. Yeah, I'm trying to skip it too, but it's so frickin' slow. Alright. Four percent. Somebody gave it a positive review. Here it is from Variety, of course it's Variety. Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from video games, Street Fighter, The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to oogle besides the titular heroine. Huh. Well there you go. A whopping four percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, Rama, nobody forced you to watch it, I don't know what to tell you. I was bored, what can I tell you, I couldn't get any alcohol. No compensation for Morison's Radio, sorry. Our compensation is go watch Silent Hill again and see a good game movie. Yes. Or the original Mortal Kombat if you ask me. The first Mortal Kombat was fantastic. Yeah, it's not bad. Yes it was. I'd even, I would even say it was really close to theme. The second one is Time Is Life, you know, I wish I had back. I hope the third one comes out some day. Alright, Rama we're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, but take care buddy, okay? You too, alright, later everyone. We'll try to do at least one more call here. Do we have any last minute stories? Dark Sakura, I know you had one. You alright over there? Dark Sakura's gonna hopefully give us a last minute story here. Anyway, I'm glad the microphone didn't catch that. Let me actually go ahead and take a call because our phone's ringing off the hook here. It just took a little bit. Hi Aaron, I'll show you, who's this? Sorry. Hey, this is Ray, this is actually my first time calling, I've been listening to this show for four years now I guess. Well. Two years now, I've missed once. It's good to hear from you, I'm sorry I missed your name because you're a little quiet. What was your name again? Oh, Ray. Ry? R-A-Y. Oh. R-A-Y, yeah, it's my real name, heaven forbid. Okay. Well what is up, Ray? Uh, nothing really, it's 11 o'clock on spring break, all my friends are away, I have nothing to do but stay up till 11 o'clock and listen to this show, I love it. I don't think I've missed a week. Well, thank you very much, we appreciate you listening to the show. Did you hear something on tonight's show that you wanted to comment on? Any of the stories? Yeah, actually, uh, indie games pretty much. I can't remember the specifics because I was just thinking of something to call about, so I'm not just here battling like an idiot on the internet, but Cave Story, has anyone played it? I'm pretty sure it's low-key, might have. Um, no, tell us a little more about this game, I don't think I've heard of this. Uh, Cave Story. Have you ever heard of Cave Story? It's a PC title, it's pretty cool. Oh, I guess it's coming to the Wii. Oh, okay. It is coming to the Wii, that's why I brought it up, because it's getting a graphical redesign, but on the PC, it's free, it's translated from Japanese, and it's kind of a, I want to say classic style shooter, sort of like Mega Man, but a whole lot harder. No, wait, I'm lying, no, it's a little easier, because I beat it, and I'm not that good at Mega Man games. I thought I'd notice that Google Cave Story or English translation should come up one of the first few topics. Well, our chat room sure seems to know this game, and I'm actually trying to look up a little bit online to see if I know anything about this, and sadly, no, I don't know how I missed this, I guess I just, I'm not cool. I've talked about Cave Story before. Have you? Yeah, a couple times, I don't care for it, but it's neat. Um, I guess they're making a version on PSP as well, it looks like? Homebrew. It's a Homebrew project. Oh, okay. Huh, interesting though. How did you find this game? I was looking through a list of Homebrew PSP games, and I found it there, and I learned more about it, and it had a PC version, which was really good. Really good. It's the same game, almost, but it looks bigger, better. I don't know why, is it just me, or does this game look very, like, old-school 8-bit NES-style graphics? Precisely. Another thing I wanted to mention was, um, Team Fortress 2 had an 8-bit demake called Gang Garrison 2. I have not seen this. Oh, it's a side-scrolling, isometric shooter, but it's team-based online, and it's anywhere from 10 players at a time to 100 players at a time. Huh. Yeah, you can play as all nine major classes, and it's kind of simplified, but there's still technique to it, like, uh, the Pyro has the Puffer instead of the Backbringer, there's none of the special extra weapons, and you can deflect rockets back, and 50 on 50 matches are crazy. I've installed it on the computer lab at, uh, my school. It's pretty neat. Do they let you do that? We have a kind of lax administrator, and we put it on thumb drives anyway, so it's alright. It's only five megs. Gotcha. Alright, alright. Um, here's my question. I noticed, you mentioned this game as a demake, and we've talked about, I know last week's show we were talking about, like, a Final Fantasy X demake and some of this stuff. What do you think makes these demakes so popular, where people go back in time and remake games such as, like, you know, Team Fortress 2 or whatever, whatever the game is? Why do you think people want to keep remaking, or Guitar Hero has had tons of these, like, in the Commodore 64 and stuff. Why do people want to remake these games on old systems? What do you think is the allure of it? Well, it's kind of like, almost the opposite of, uh, the, what was that? I think it's the opposite of, uh, say, just a second here, how Mega Man X, one of the later X games, took the classic Mega Man action from a pseudo-3D view. It's sort of strange seeing the new medium, exactly as with the Guitar Hero Commodore remake. Hmm. I don't know, I don't get into a whole lot of these. I don't know if I necessarily, usually I'm just kind of like, oh, hmm, that's neat, but I don't really have to, like, play the whole thing in its entirety, so it's just kind of, it's kind of interesting that there's this whole kind of community around there, around the demakes. I always thought it was interesting. There's a Silent Hill 2 remake, I think it was, like, Soundless Mountain 2. Really? For what system? I know. PC. Huh. Interesting. Look up, uh, Google TIG source demake composition, or, uh, Competition Camera Witch, these funny titles sometimes. They had one for, uh, like a Dig Dug demake, I wonder how they pulled that off. I don't know how they pulled that off. Dig Dug demake? Wasn't Dig Dug kind of an old-ass game to begin with? Yeah, that's what I was wondering. They have one for Left 4 Dead called Left 4K Dead, which is Java-based, and it's 4K at 4 kilobytes already. Huh. Wow. Pretty sure they had a Bioshock demake, too. Nah, I've seen the Bioshock demake. Interesting. Wow, there's a whole lot. And again, lots of positive feedback to Cave Story in our chatroom. GameGuru says, but yeah, Cave Story is a Metroidvania worth buying and it's free on PC. Any PC gamer should own it. I might have to just seek that out. So you found that amongst all the chat about Wang? What? In the chatroom? No, I didn't. I haven't been paying attention to chat, sorry. Well, I mean, I have, but I haven't. What's the big deal with Wang? Oh, nothing. Just discussion about Watchmen. Oh, jeez. Alright. Oh, well, I saw Watchmen. That was an amazing movie. Did you read the comics? I've read the comic. They almost used the book as a shooting script. Well, I'm kind of disappointed it left out the death of the first Night Owl, but they had to make room. Well, question for you. Do you think the movie ending was better or the comic ending? And don't spoil it because I haven't seen it. Don't spoil it. Just say which one you prefer. They could not have pulled off the comic ending. They would have left so many people scratching their heads and to fit the missing writer plot into there would have added another hour. The comic ending, the movie ending was so streamlined and it worked. I honestly think that the movie ending better fits the audience today. That's my opinion. Yeah. Without going into how hokey the comic one was. All my friends gave it bad reviews. They went in there expecting like Spider-Man or Dark Knight. It's its own own thing. No, this is R-rated, folks. The movie ending doesn't make any sense. Yes, it does. No, it doesn't. Did you read the comics? Yes, I did. A difference of opinion. It doesn't make any sense because. I will go see it and be the tie vote. Without trying to explain too much of the ending of the movie. It's because a certain character is aligned with a certain country and if that certain, you know, thing happened, then everyone would blame the certain country and no world peace would happen. It would just be all everybody against the one country. Except that it happened within the one country too. I'm so confused. It doesn't matter though. Anyway. All right. Another discussion. We should do a movie cast. Someday. Maybe as a one-off. We should call it ultimate spoiler cast. All right. Ray, I got to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much. And I hope you had a good time on your first call and call again sometime. Okay. All right. Sweet. I'll call back next week. All right. Later. We may not be here next week, but in two weeks. All right. Bye. All right. Later. All right. We like first time callers. That's a good note to end on tonight, I think. So sorry guys who didn't get through. We're going to close up the Skypline for now. You can always send us emails, mailbag orange launch, radio.com, or of course we will continue to read chat comments throughout the night. We still have some last minute stories, dark soccer. I'm sorry. We didn't get to you, but Hey, if I hadn't taken that call, it wouldn't have been a first time caller. So I wouldn't have been burping. Okay. So, um, there is a, uh, a marketing stunt that went kind of, uh, nuts and it was, um, actually by monument PR, um, for Friday the 13th for the launch of resident evil five. And the, basically the big stunt was a treasure hunt, um, where about 50, uh, members of the public would go and retrieve arms, legs, heads, and torsos from a number of different areas. Um, so, um, it was basically, um, part of, you know, like I said, part of the, the big campaign. Um, so they, uh, hid all the body parts, um, within the square mile of London, like, um, in bins and on window ledges and a hundred people signed up. Um, so, um, basically it actually said that, um, the people paying attention to it, passers by complained to the police and officers were there at the finishing line, um, to greet the people who are trying to assemble bodies. So it's the whole thing. I read about this earlier on the weekend, the whole thing sounded stupid and like, it did look kind of gross. Like, you know, there's just certain things that, you know, you gotta wonder who the hell thought this was a good idea, right? Maybe it was just me. I don't know. Loki. Well, thank you to our emailer and to Jamie for that one. Loki, did you have anything tonight? Uh, just some small stuff. Um, Watchmen, The End of Nigh 2 has been announced and apparently it is more of the same. However, um, it's supposed to be a little bit racier. Apparently it's been rated by the ESRB and describes, uh, some sexual content in there, including, um, nice. There's a, let's see here. Uh, well basically the sexual content, I guess, is the more racier part. Oh, I don't know the blue peen. Well, that's not necessarily in there. As a watch, I guess you'll, um, fight in a strip club that includes, uh, go-go dancers in cages, peep show booths, and a pornographic film in the background. However, um, in case you haven't played the first Watchmen, The End of Nigh, it sucks. And so if it's more of the same, it's more of the suck. So don't buy it. Or at least try the demo. Um, apparently Peter Moore of EA is saying that Wii Motion Plus is going to put an end to lazy Wiimote gaming. Um, apparently the 1-1, uh, motion capture that is part of, um, Wii Motion Plus requires you to actually make the full swing when playing a golf game or tennis game. You can't just, like, move your wrists a little bit. Which is great, because that'll encourage more people to throw stuff through their TV. Sweet. Um, now of course we talked about earlier a free PopCap game you can get on St. Patty's Day, but of course there's going to be some more stuff coming out as well, including Little Big Planet is going to be giving away a free, um, St. Patty's Day costume. That'll include a beard, a shiny green suit, a green top hat, and other stuff to make your character look like a leprechaun. Um, also in April there's going to be another free costume that's a Monkey King costume. Apparently it was the winning entry of the PlayStation Asia contest, the design costume contest. And then there's some more paid costumes coming out later, including a Killzone mini pack, Buzz mini pack, Patapon costume, and a Heavenly Sword mini pack as well. But I want some more damn expansions, that's what I want. More stuff like Metal Gear Solid, because that's awesome. And then finally, um, Resident Evil 5 is already going to get some download content. The VS download content, it's been dated in Japan. It's going to be available for, um, 250 yen and 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live. It is, um, apparently coming out in a few weeks. And we'll add in some new online co-op modes, as well as some competitive online options. Uh, I guess some four player, um, game modes and stuff like that as well. So that's kind of neat. And I'm sure it'll be coming out over here around the same time. That is it. All right. Lots and lots of last minute stuff, but it's been a little bit of a busy week. Well, we're going to try to wrap things up and get on out of here for the evening. So we got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night. Um, brings us to the end of the show. Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. Your final thought. Blarg. My final thought is Cherry 7-Up is delicious. And I've had two cans tonight during the show. That can't be healthy. Loki, your final thought. Um, my final thought is Pagel is fun. All right. That's going to do it. Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting independent radio. Remember, if you like what you hear, we do this for free. We do it for fun. We do it for you. Just tell two people you know about the show, help us spread the word because word of mouth is how we are able to, um, you know, spread the word about our show. So that's it. We will be back maybe next week. Stay tuned to the website for updates on the show. Uh, but for sure in two weeks, we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. So until then, thank you guys.
