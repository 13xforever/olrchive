Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, March 29th, 2009

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Will OnLive be the next great console?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Could Netflix come out for PlayStation 3 and Wii?

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And the classic 8-bit game is re-released for the iPhone

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
We're back after a week vacation

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
To talk more about video games, video gaming, gaming culture

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
And the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
As well as my awesome co-hosts

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hi

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
How are you, Miss Jamie Summers?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I am

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
You are, because you is? I don't know

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I be

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Because you be

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Alright, also joining us tonight

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hi, how's it going?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Good, how are you?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Could have been better, because

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, Adobe Bro...

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I don't know what it is, it's just like an ongoing theme of my laptop

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
An update from the manufacturer

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Like, for example, Microsoft's update or whatever

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Or Adobe, even Flash

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Is breaking something

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
So, like, Windows update broke my computer

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
And I had to actually reinstall everything

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
And now, Flash update broke the Flash media encoder

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah, just to kind of explain a little bit for listeners

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Especially those on the podcast

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
We do tape live, obviously

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
And live radio has interesting advantages

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
As in, we get to interact with you guys live

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
And disadvantages, as to things don't always work the way we plan

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
So, Loki is trying to show

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Something on

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Justin.tv, our video feed

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Which we'll get into a little bit later

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
But he wants to do it, because for whatever reason

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
His laptop is not, suddenly decided

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
It didn't want to cooperate with the video anymore

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, it wants to do audio, but no video

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah, it's weird, so

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
But you know, this type of thing is not limited to PCs

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I'll tell you what, my laptop, my MacBook

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Has been out of commission for, like, a month

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Because an Apple update

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Screwed up my boot up

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Like, it'll get to the gray screen

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
And I get the spinning wheel, and it just freezes there

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And from everything I've been told

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I just need to reinstall OS X

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I don't know where the hell I put it

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I bought my laptop a year and a half ago

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, stupid me for losing it, right

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
But now I have to find a friend's disk

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
To install it off of

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
So, yeah, I'm out of, I can't use a laptop right now

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
So, stinks

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Alright

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
So anyhow, let's get into

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Some, how was your gaming week?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
We always like to start off the show with

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
How was your gaming week, so let's do that

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
For a little while, it actually was non-existent

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Given that I had a mid-term

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Last week, and lots of school crap

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
To do

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
But I did actually

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Play Cooking Mama for

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
iPhone, which is

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
It's only got a few recipes

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
On it, so it's super short

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
But I like the control on it better than on the DS

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
It was actually pretty fun

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
So that's one game that translates itself very

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Very well for iPhone

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And for those that don't remember, DarkSakura loves her Cooking Mama

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
On DS

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I actually downloaded another game

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
That let me find the name of it

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Because it's also on iPhone

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Really, a lot of my gaming has been iPhone-based lately

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Except for Last Night, which I'll get into

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
In just a second

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
It's called LightBike, and it's a free

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Lightcycle game

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Like in Tron

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
So it's pretty cool

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And then

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I wouldn't say this is a game, but it's a fun little app

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
As I've been playing with my koi pond lately

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
And

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Also, as I'm

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Being reminded

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Via hint, hint, hint

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Is I did actually

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Review Cooking Mama

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
On AvengersTower.com

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
So if you want to check it out

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
You can see my full review there

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
No, wait a minute, not Orangelaunchradio.com

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
You review games over on

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Giggling Girls site, but you won't do it

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I'll copy it over! I'm just messing

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
We're getting Tiara over, hopefully to do game reviews

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
As well, right? For us

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Hopefully, yes, thumbs up, good

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
There is hope in the positive direction

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
She plays a lot of games I never get around to playing

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
So I like reading her reviews

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Last night was all about

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
The Rufus Belly

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
For Street Fighter IV

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
No, last night at my house

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Oh lordy

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
We got it on with video games

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
In a big way

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
My husband and I, and no it wasn't anything kinky

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Got it on, huh?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
With video games? Sick

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Hush, hush, hush

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Last night we decided

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
We were going to totally

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Go for the PC Engine fun

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So we broke out our PC Engine

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Core graphics

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
So we could play our Japanese Hu-Cards

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
And then we broke out the

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Turbo Duo

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Which we've got to play the import

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
CDs

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
We found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
We're so happy

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
My copy of Space Fantasy Zone however

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Has a hole in it

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Not a hole where the spindle goes

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
But a hole in the disc

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Therefore we got to the first

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Boss

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
How does that even happen? I don't know

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
There's shit in my house

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
We got to the first boss and is like

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Game over, I quit, you win

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Game over, no more

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And for people who don't know

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Space Fantasy Zone

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Because the

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Are set in the same universe

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
It's basically Fantasy Zone from the

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Space Harrier behind the

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Player perspective

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
So it's pretty cool

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And it has remixes of

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
All the old Fantasy Zone music done in

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Sort of that Space Harrier style

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
And I'll have to

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Actually bring you tracks to play

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
On this show sometime Rob, they're really cool

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And so

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I went, now this game is also

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
A prototype, they did not release

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It, they had just like

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Base cover artwork for it and it never

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
As far as I'm aware, never got

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
An official release and so

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I've been racking my brain trying

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
To find some way to burn

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
A new copy of the game but hell

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
If I know how to burn multi session you know

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Audio and

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Data weird compilation

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I found how to do it but it's a lot of hard work

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
And I'm lazy

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Let me read some comments from chat real quick

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Here at chat.orangelandradio.com

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
If you're listening live on this Sunday evening

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Here on All Games Radio where we broadcast every Sunday night

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
We chat at chat.orangelandradio.com

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And there's of course some comments to

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
DarkSakura talking about the

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Hole in her disc

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Goldanthro in chat says a hole in the disc?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Mmm disc sex

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Since you know you're talking about getting it on and all

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Andrew says holy disc

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
But he forgot

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
He forgot the Batman part. Holy disc Batman

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
To be specific

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
It wasn't actually a physical hole through it

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I found out

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But somehow or another on both sides of the

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Disc

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
The

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Covering on it had been scratched

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Off

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
So maybe it's just something that

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
It was clamped on

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Or poked on or something I don't know

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
In a box or something I have no idea

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
By the way the chat is also reminding me

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Since you're talking about getting it

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Since you're talking about getting it on with video games

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And all that I forgot to play something before the show tonight

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
The following program is intended

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
For mature audiences

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
And there you go

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Just so you know don't say we didn't warn you

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Alright anything else in your gaming week besides such

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Nerdy PC Engine retro

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Fun? Oh there's a lot more

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Well it was all PC Engine though nerdy

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Fun

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So we took off some of the games that we're playing

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
We put in Dracula X, Ys, Book 1 and 2

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Freaking epic

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Um

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
We played Legend of the Valkyries

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Son Son

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Twinbee, we broke out our copy of

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Twinbee

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
And um

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
What else did we play? God

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Cause I put pictures up on the gallery

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I took a picture of my foot next to our

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
PC Engine core graphics

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So you can see how little the PC Engine core graphics

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Are on my foot

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
We also played

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Final lap

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Twin

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Victory run

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Keith Courage, no we didn't play Keith Courage

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Cause that game is crap

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Adventure Island, we played Adventure Island

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Which is pretty fun

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
So yeah we were getting on with the

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Hudson play last night

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
It was pretty cool

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Good times

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Lots of classic gaming

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Alright folks before we get into Loki's

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Gaming week here

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Justin TV is now up if you're listening live

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
And Loki I'm assuming you're going to talk about what's going on here on Justin TV

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
While you're talking about your gaming week

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah basically

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Like I said I've been playing Grand Theft Auto

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Mainly Lost in Damned cause that's all I play

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
But um

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh yeah I forgot

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
This is my bosses 360

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Well technically it's my 360 but it's the one that he

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Uses cause I own 5 of them

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
For some reason but this is my old 360

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
It's modded

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So I figured out how to hack

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Grand Theft Auto 4

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Basically because

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Rockstar is so lazy when it comes to

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Programming that they literally use

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Files that have been around since you know

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Oh and it froze

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
For a second there

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Phone call

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Anyway so basically

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Uses the same PC files and stuff

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
So you can edit it the same way as you'd edit

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Like you know handling files and that kind of thing

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
So for example I can

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Kick that motorcycle really hard

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And it will go flying

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Cause I edited

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
The physics

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
The punching and stuff it's just fun

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Cause my boss he's

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Oh they're going into orbit

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
They seriously will punch a person into flying into orbit

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Here I know this is horrible

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Oh my god they just disappeared

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Like

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Sorry I know this is crappy radio

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
That's awesome

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
That is fantastic

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I love it

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm sure this will be in the archives as well

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
For those listening on the radio

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
We'll play it during break

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
But there's a lot more stuff you can tweak

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Basically you can edit it like you can edit the PC version

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
If you know how to do it

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And yeah

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
We've played it online

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Between the five of us

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
That play Grand Theft Auto

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
My boss he needs all the help he can get

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And you can't actually cheat

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Because it's funny the way the game works

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Say for example we originally

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Beefed up his weapons

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
To make him really overpowered

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Because he kind of needs that help

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And we got a weird side effect

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Was anybody that got near him

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Would get the same kind of upgrades

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
To their weapons

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
So it kind of cancels each other out

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
The only thing that doesn't affect

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Vehicle handling if he gets into a bus

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
They're basically like rockets now

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
They just go really fast and smash through everything

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
That won't affect other people

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And also physics on the weapons

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Like the punching I was just doing

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
That won't affect other people

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And if you try to punch another player that you're playing with

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
It won't affect them either

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It'll just be like a normal punch

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
So it's basically just to fuck around with

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And this one I made a new one

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
To kind of demonstrate some of the crazy crap you can do in it

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
But it's basically just like the PC version

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Reading some comments from chat

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Because the live chatters are kind of watching this whole thing

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
And maybe I can describe

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
This for the folks only listening to this on the podcast version

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Dark Tetsuya says

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So now it's Hancock the video game

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Death Wishing says Falcon Punch

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
X-Link says

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
He's Siler

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
And Act F says Grand Theft Auto with Crackdown Physics

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Cool freaking awesome

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That was pretty hilarious

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
It's basically

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
You could potentially cheat

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
In the online games with this

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
But you'd be banned pretty quick

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I'm guessing he's going to be banned eventually

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
But what do I care?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Because it's my boss, it's not me

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And it's my modded console anyway

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
So what do I care?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
But no

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
It's just a really fun experiment

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
As far as I'm aware

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I'm sure other people have done it

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
But the only video I've seen online

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
There's only been one person that's done it

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And he's the guy that actually made this program called OpenIV

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Which is one of the programs that I use

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It basically opens one of the files that's on

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
The actual Xbox 360 disc

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And it's also part of the PC stuff

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
It's kind of like their version of a zip file or something

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
So

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I kind of figured out how to

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Extract everything

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
It is tricky because if you change something

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
If you change certain bytes or whatever

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
The file size changes and it gets too big

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
But I actually overwrote

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
There's multiple languages on the disc

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
So I overwrote the Spanish language with the English language

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Which was a lot smaller in file size

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So I can edit whatever I want

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
And I can just pad it with a bunch of null bytes

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
But anyways, so beyond the Grand Theft Auto stuff

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I did play other things

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I can't stop playing PEGAL DS

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
And I really don't want to play it anymore

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
But I finished PEGAL

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
The regular PEGAL stuff on there

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Now I unlocked PEGAL Knights

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
So I can play that

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Which I think is basically the same thing as PEGAL

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
It's just everybody's now a superhero for some reason

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Whatever

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
It's fun

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Nellie hasn't gotten a chance to play it yet

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
So I don't know if she'd like it

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
But I don't know, it's fun

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Just watch TV and play that game

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And then I also tried TrackMania DS

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Which is pretty good

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
But the only thing that kind of sucks about it

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Is because the DS screens are so small

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Your field of view is really small in the game

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
But other than that, it's basically just

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
The same as the PC version

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Which is pretty awesome

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
So that's kind of cool

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And then

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I think that's about it really

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I wanted to play a lot more games

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I was meaning to install that new update

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
For the Wii

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Not exactly the same way

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
As you'd normally update it

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
But, you know, special way

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Because I got a 16GB card

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
To go with that

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
So maybe we'll hear some more about this next week

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Yes, and then

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
By the way, Tigerclaw in chat says you should hack PEGAL

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
And put in some crazy ass physics

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Just like you did in Grand Theft Auto

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It's not as easy to hack other games

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
In Grand Theft Auto, if you literally extract

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
All the files that are in those compressors

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
It's exactly the same as what you see on the PC

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Formats are the same

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Files are actually somewhat the same

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
The only thing that's different is the texture files and stuff

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
But if you learn how to hack one

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
You can hack both versions

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
You probably can hack the PS3 version

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
If you figure out how they store it

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I haven't been able to

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
And I really wanted to figure out how to get it to install

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Because I can actually install that

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
To this hard drive

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
So you can do the game installations

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
On the new Xbox Experience

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And yes, the disk I have obviously is modified

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Because I had to burn a modified ISO

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
To get it to work

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Because I'm editing it

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
But you can actually run it with the real disk

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Once it's installed on the hard drive

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Because all it does is check to make sure that disk is legit

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And then it'll run wherever the hell you want

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
But I literally took apart my 360

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
One of the other five

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
To try to get it to install

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I was actually going to do a disk swap

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
On the CD-ROM drive

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I literally took the CD-ROM drive apart

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Unfortunately that thing spins so fast

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
It's impossible to do that

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
But it's fun

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
It's cool

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Repeat at your own risk

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
He's voiding all sorts of warranties

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
All sorts of warranties

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
If one of these Xboxes is E74

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
It's tough shit

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
And I'm not going to go post online how to do this

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Basically

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
You can figure it out the same way

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
As you would modify a song in Guitar Hero

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
The information is out there

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
You just kind of have to figure it out

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And really I don't want a lot of people

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Just online cheating like hell

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I'm not doing that

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
We do it for fun

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
For your own amusement

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
But as you can see

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
There's no way I'm faking this

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Since it's lost and damned

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
There's no way to port that to the PC yet

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
It's just fun

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I think you're going to play a little bit

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
On and off throughout the night

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
You might kind of pause as you're reading news stories

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And so on but you can kind of watch the action

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Go down at Justin TV

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Which is also available, thanks to Dekeman

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
For reminding me, we have it in a little box now

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
On OrangeLawnTrader.com

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I'm not used to it being right there on our homepage

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
But it is, so you can just look at OrangeLawnTrader.com

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
And you can read the reviews that were posted this week

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And watch Justin TV at the same time

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It's pretty cool

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
My gaming week, we've been out for two weeks

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I actually got caught up on quite a few games

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
And this challenge is just so adorable

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
On the Nintendo DS

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I can't think of a better way to describe this game

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It's really adorable

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Basically what they did, they took a lot of like

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Inspired 8-bit games

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I mean they're all original, old-school retro games

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
That you play in this

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
But they all kind of are reminiscent of games you might have played

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Back in the day

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
On the Nintendo Entertainment System

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
For instance, there's a racing game

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
That's kind of a little bit, I don't know, like Spy Hunter-ish

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Just without the weapons

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Kind of a Xanax-style shooter

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
As well as

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Galaga

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Has like a type of shooter in there as well

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
And there's an RPG

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It's just a really cute little game

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Basically the way the game works is that you

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Are basically sucked into the life of a child in the 80s

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Playing all these new games with a friend

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
And the cool thing is that

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
As you play through these challenges

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
You unlock little magazines

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
You know, you might have heard of this

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
These games, game magazines

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
That you look through and get new tips out of

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And of course they have cheat codes

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
There's all these little throwbacks

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
To things we might remember from the 80s

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Like really bad Engrish and some of the games

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
And all this stuff

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Here's the only thing I didn't like about Retro Game Challenge

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Is that everything was very sequential

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Like when you buy the game, you have to start with a particular shooter game

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Then move on to the racing game

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Then move on

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
You know, and I kind of would have liked a little more openness

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Even if it didn't

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Give you everything at once

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Maybe if you started with three of the games

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And you could kind of go back and forth

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
And beat the challenges you wanted to in one

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
And then move on to another

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I would have liked to see a little more freedom

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
In the way the actual game itself was set up

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
But it's not enough to really distract

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
From the fact that the game is really a throwback

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
To the old school days

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
So honestly

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Excuse me, if you were a kid gaming in the 1980s

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I think you'd get a kick out of this

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And might want to check it out on the Nintendo DS

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Sorry, yes

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Start to see us as Zanac is the game

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Not Xanax, that's a, I think, drug

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Anyhow, also games

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
That I've been playing, Bit.Trip Beat

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
On the Nintendo Wii

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Kind of interesting, it's like Pong meets Guitar Hero

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Type thing, where as you move

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
The paddle up and down

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Which you do by tilting the Wiimote

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
You can control

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Chiptune type music

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Everything's very scripted in the game

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Which you don't understand really

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
With the trailers, it kind of looks like you're playing

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
A natural game of Pong or something

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
But everything is very, very scripted

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
In these very long stages

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
That go on for, I think, about 15 minutes

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Playing these different songs

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Now the only drawback is that there's only

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Three stages, so there's only really three songs

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
But when you consider that 600

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Wii points is what you'd pay for

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Three rock band songs

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I still think you kind of are getting your deal out of this game

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I think it's a fun little game

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You know, I don't think it's anything

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
You're going to play forever and ever

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
But for $6 it's not bad

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I'd recommend the game

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Bobby and I were talking about it a little bit at the end of his show

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Because he's on just before us

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Here on All Games Radio and I gave it a B or a B-

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
With him, so that's about where I'd put it

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Other games I've been playing

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
This week

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Final Fantasy Crystal Defenders

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Which is very similar to a lot of those

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Flash tower defender games you see online

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Except now with Black Mages and Archers

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Surprisingly a lot of fun

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I did it on both of the iPhone and the Xbox 360

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
And I have to admit I like it a little more

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
On the Xbox 360 because of the fast forward button

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And if the iPhone has one I haven't found it yet

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I'm sure it's in there somewhere

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
But I just thought that was

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
It's just a fun little time waster and time distracter

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
But on the Xbox 360 you have to remember

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It is a port of a cell phone game

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
So you're not going to have a lot of extravagant graphics

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Or anything, but you know a good game doesn't necessarily

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Need great graphics, for instance BitTripBeat

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Has the graphics of an Atari 2600 game

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
But it's still kind of fun

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And then also just a few things here and there

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I checked out Hasbro Family Game Night

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Briefly which is a little bit

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
You know it's a little deceptive

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Well I don't know if I should say deceptive

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
But it's unlike other games

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Because I thought you were going to get all these games

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
The Kinect 4, the Scrabble

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
And all this stuff for 10 bucks

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
No no, each of those games within Scrabble

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Or within Family Game Night

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Cost 10 bucks

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Family Game Night is like the front end

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
So it's an interesting way to deliver the games

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
But I don't know, 10 dollars

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
A little high for games like Kinect 4

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It might be worth it to play games like Scrabble

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Online, but I don't know so much

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
About the others, so I guess it's kind

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Of cool they let you pick and choose

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
The other interesting thing, here's what I don't understand

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
About Family Game Night

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Is there's a lot of people

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I'm watching Twitter and stuff and a lot of people

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
That are getting really into this and playing this

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And trying to meet up with folks online

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
But these are the same people that would dismiss

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
A lot of the Wii games that are coming out recently

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
As shovelware

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Well, Family Game Night was released on the Wii

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And if you think about it, in some ways

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
It almost had a better value

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Because I think there's 7 games in this thing

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Which would cost you 70 dollars altogether

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I think the Wii version had one less game

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
So it was like 60 dollars

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
But you were only paying like 40 for it

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Now granted, you know

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
The Wii version doesn't have internet play

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
So it kind of depends how much that's worth to you

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And all that, but it just kind of amuses me

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
That I think a lot of people forget

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It's one big bundle on the Wii

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Something to consider

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
If you're going to get all these games

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Or if you think this is something that might be for you

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Because you have a family

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
There's already a version out there on the Wii

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
That's probably going to be in the bargain bin before too long

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
That might suit you better

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
But of course, online play goes a long way

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I get that

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I checked out the demo for Uno Rush

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
I didn't like it at all

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I didn't like the way the game runs at all

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It's not the video game itself

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
It's not the way it was ported

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I don't like the game itself

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I don't like the whole organizing your cards

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
As the game goes on

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
And plus, I don't think it's worth the 5 extra dollars

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
That they want to charge for that

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
As opposed to the 5 dollars for regular Uno

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Which seems to be a more accepted price point

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And sadly one that we rarely see anymore

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, Uno is so a few years ago

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Some comments from chatroom

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Leo Shen says

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Hardcore Xbox Connect Fucking 4 is worth 10 dollars

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Drop your piece, bitch

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Sneaky there, you bitch

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I guess that could be worth it

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I don't know, I just think it would get a little old after a while

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
But then again, you know what

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
How can I say Uno is great

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
And then say these games are not great

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
The only difference really is 5 more dollars

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And these games graphically are a little more polished

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Than the ones in Family Game Night

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I don't know

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
GameGuru says you might pick it up

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
When it's in the bargain bin

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Perhaps

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
That's about it for my gaming week

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I have a lot of little things here and there

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
But I didn't play a lot of games for a long, long time

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
That's the weird thing

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Is that I played a lot of games here and there

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Probably Retro Game Challenge is the one I played the most

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Because I've unlocked like

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Maybe 5 different games in Retro Game Challenge now

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
So there's a lot, a lot of

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Stuff to do there

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Alright, let's move on into some housekeeping

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
And then we'll get into the gaming news

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Because there was a lot of news this week

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And that's not even counting the week we were gone

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I don't even think we're going to have time to address the week we were gone

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
From Game Developers Conference

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Just some quick housekeeping

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
We don't have a lot of stuff to note right off the top

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
But we do want to remind you guys to join our Twitter

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
At OLR is our username on Twitter

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
So that's getting more and more popular

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
We got like randomly like 20 new followers all in one day

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I don't know if somebody followed Friday to us

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Is that what it is?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
There was a lot of people

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Because we didn't have

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
But maybe 150 to begin with

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
So I just thought it was pretty cool

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
So thanks to everybody who's now following us on Twitter

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
If you're not on there yet, you should add us

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
We ask questions and we're going to read replies a little later in the show

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
You don't even have to really be listening live

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm going to get to tonight's question a little bit later

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
And also though, you don't just have Twitter

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Because I know there's a lot of anti-Twitters out there

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
That's fine, whatever you're into

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Facebook, OLR is our club on Facebook

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
We have a MySpace as well

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Orange Lounge Radio

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
But is it just me or is MySpace like quickly dying off?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Like Facebook is really stomping them out

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I hated MySpace from the first day I was on it

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
So the only reason I

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Even remotely look at it anymore

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Is because my brothers every so often are on there

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
There were things I liked about MySpace

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But I'm slowly not liking it as much anymore

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The only thing that I wish that Facebook would get

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Is customizable backgrounds

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And then

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
The other thing, LiveJournal

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Is also our community at Orange Lounge

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Which we haven't posted a lot too lately

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Especially as our

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Listeners and stuff post things there

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
We always read that and keep an eye on that

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Okay

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Also yeah, Dekeman reminds us

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Hey there's that little box called extended play

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
On the OLR homepage and it has it all

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
It has like our last FM group, our steam community

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
If you want to find some like-minded gamers

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
That cool people to listen to

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
A little internet radio program out of someone's

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Garage then check it out

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
On OrangeLoungeRadio.com

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Alright let's get into some gaming news because damn

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
A lot happened this week and that might be thanks to

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
A little thing called the Game Developers Conference

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Which might I remind you is not E3

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It's not where the companies are supposed

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
To make their big, big announcements

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
But sometimes you'll hear things aimed

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Towards developers and we have had big announcements

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Out of GDC in the past, for instance

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
PlayStation Home was a big one we got a couple years ago

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
And sometimes you get some game announcements

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Here and there, but we got quite a bit out of this year's

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Game Developer Conference. Loki's gonna start us off tonight

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Yes, there's a new

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I'm not even sure if you'd call it a console

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Format I guess, on Live

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Which is gonna basically

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Be almost like

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I guess those TiVo boxes

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
That you can get where you can stream

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Videos to your home

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
This service you'll actually be able to stream

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Games to your home

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And it'll also be like a really small

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Box that you would put next to your TV

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Have a USB controller

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
That would plug into it and basically you'll be able to stream

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
High end games, everything from

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Crysis to Burnout, Paradise

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Stuff like that

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
And they're saying that they

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Can do it within the limits of bandwidth

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Right now and that there's minor

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
No lag whatsoever

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
But the frame rate can take a hit

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
If your stream isn't that

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Doesn't have that much bandwidth

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
So you see

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
When I was first reading about this I was thinking

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
It was gonna be like GameTap

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
But something you took up to your TV

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And I think I remember saying a long time ago

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And I don't even know if it was when we interviewed

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
The guy from GameTap, that was a long time ago

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
But I remember we were talking about GameTap should be something

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
You can plug into your TV and this thing would

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Sell like crazy

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
This might as well be like an extension

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Of GameTap or just rename it to GameTap

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
And just have like

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Well the same people are involved so they can't really do that

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Well damn just talk to

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Hey okay you got the technology

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
You've got the technology, they've got the name

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And you know, let's do it

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Not only do we get the high end PC games

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Let's get some you know the retro stuff

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Just have everything

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Okay but the streaming frame skipping is weird to me

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Because the way GameTap works

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
You download the whole game to your computer

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And then play it that way

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
It doesn't sound like this works the same way

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
This is being run on like a remote server

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
That you're actually playing

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Which is pretty impressive when you think about it

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Because there's like little

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
No lag whatsoever, at least no discernible lag

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
So that's kind of cool

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Or so they say

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I mean let's face it right

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Obviously right now they have to probably test the hell out of it

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
Because I can't imagine that this is really going to work

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I mean unless they have one hell of an algorithm

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Basically it is

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Because the way I see it

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
You're going to need a PC for every one of these

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Things that are going

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
So each person is going to need their own PC

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Basically in this remote server

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
To be able to play this stuff

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Whatever game

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
So this does not hook up to your TV?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
No, well it does hook up to your TV

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
But I mean

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
You don't need your own PC

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Your own high end PC to run this stuff

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Which I think you should

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Actually be able to play these games

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Is the effort that it takes to

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Own a PC or build a PC to do it

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
But whatever

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
In your hacking and cracking opinion

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Well not really

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Because I'd be pissed off if my stream crisis

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Got to the end and couldn't finish it

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Because the game was broken

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You hook this box into your TV

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Correct? Yes

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
So you don't need a computer at all or a monitor

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
That's important

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
All you need to do is basically hook it up to

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Well

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
On the back here it looks like they've got a phone jack

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
And they've also got

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
That might be a USB jack actually

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Never mind

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
But they've got an ethernet and then your HDMI

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
That's going to plug into that

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I don't know

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
It looks neat

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Some of the other cool features on there

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
They're going to have a way you can share

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Videos

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
They call them brag clips

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
No real gamer score obviously

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
You can rent the game

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
You can demo it before you buy it

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Obviously

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Lots of cool stuff

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
And I don't know

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
It's a neat idea if they can get it to work

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
That'd be really cool

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
The problem is I don't know if they're going to be able to get it to work

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Like they want to

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
But I think there are other applications for it

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
If this doesn't end up working out

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I'm very curious to see what's going to happen at E3

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Because you know they're going to probably

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Have to kind of show a little more

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Stuff at E3 and there's going to be a much bigger audience

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Of people watching them at E3

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I'm kind of curious to see how it really

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Flows

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
But my thing is

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
If they can get to work

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
With this little stupid box

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
And stream it

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
What's going to say stop

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Sony or Microsoft from streaming a game

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
A full game

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Over their service

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Isn't this the direction we've all seen them moving in anyway?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Yeah

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
It's not any surprise

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Microsoft and Sony have slowly been walking

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
This direction anyway

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Especially now that Sony offers their old school catalog

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
As download titles to the

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
TV and the

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
PSP

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
And now you can buy Burnout Paradise online

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Completely

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
But I think this would be even better though

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Because for a console manufacturer

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
They've already got the console to crunch everything

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
It wouldn't necessarily be all

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
On a remote server

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And sending all the information

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
And sending it your way

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
You can actually use some of the processing power

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Of the console itself

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
To kind of take care of that

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
So it should be easier to do it on a console

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Than say whatever this little box is

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Because that's basically just receiving a signal

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
That means converting the video feed

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I think it's just a matter of time

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Before we start seeing the newest, latest

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
And greatest games or things that you download

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
You know and all this

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I think it's just a matter of time

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
To get late in this generation

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I think, but especially as we start getting into

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
The next Microsoft

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
The next PS4

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Or whatever, I think we're really going to start seeing

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
These types of ideas that

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Maybe OnLive is bringing to the table

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Mixed with the

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Console power

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
So, be interesting

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Alright, well

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Talking about other things

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
That came out of

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Game Developers Conference

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
We're talking about digital rights management

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
And one of the big companies of course behind DRM

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Is Steam

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Steamworks is a new kind of thing

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
That Valve is putting together and they're talking about

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
How it's going to make DRM

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Obsolete

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Apparently Steamworks has this new anti-piracy

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Technology that involves

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Customer executable generation

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Which they're calling SEG for short

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
C-E-G

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Although which is funny because I have a friend named SEG

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But it's spelled differently

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
SEG

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
It sounds like basically each individual

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Gets their own unique executable file

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
But you can play it

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
On any compatible PC

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
No install limits

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
No rootkits

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
But when you buy the copy

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
It's your customized copy

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
So if suddenly your copy were to show up on a torrent

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Everybody would know who did it

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Interesting

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Kind of surprised a technique like this

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Hasn't been thought of a long time ago

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Wouldn't the hackers figure out a way to take

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
The information out of the EXE

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Or block it or scramble

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Or figure out how to sign it themselves

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
It's not going to work

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It's a good attempt but it's not going to work

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Well you know where there's a will

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
There's a way

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Pirates are going to hack everything

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Did they say that this way

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
That it will end piracy

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Basically?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I don't think anybody is going to make those bold statements anymore

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Like DRM obsolete

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
That they did claim

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Okay well maybe that's not so bad but

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I don't know

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I still think that

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Even if they don't even care

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
About the subject matter being put out

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I'm sorry

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
The hacking community likes a good challenge

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Tigerclaw in our chat room

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
chat.orangelandrater.com says it's called a watermark

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Which you know

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
You think like a picture

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Sometimes if you have a picture on a website

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Some websites do this crap all the time

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Like for instance

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
A company like IGN

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Might find a logo for a brand new Wii game

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
On some piddly little independent radio site

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
And copy it

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
And then they'll put their watermark on it

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
When they put it on their own website

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
So that everybody knows that when they get it

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
From the bigger website with all the bandwidth

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
That it came from IGN

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Which may or may not be true

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Is that a good analogy?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
That's a pretty good analogy I think

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
This is actually speaking of the same situation

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
What we should be doing

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Is going in photoshop and adding in

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
The image information

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Details as far as what was taken

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Where it came from that type of thing

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Embed all that data within the file

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Where you don't actually need the watermark

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I'm actually thinking that

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
That could be something more like what they're going to do

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Actually have something

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Not necessarily

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Overt like

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
A watermark like you're saying

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
But something that's embedded deep into the code

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Or maybe even

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Some little difference

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
In a code like a different color

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
On a shirt or something

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
For a particular character they know they look for that character

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
That shirt's a different color that's your copy

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
You know a series of

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Randomly generated events

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Though that will identify it

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
But not be immediately

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Yeah I was going to say if they want to be smart about this

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
They're not going to put the information out there

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
In the open. The subtle watermark

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Will be something like

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
A particular pattern that appears

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Or a picture that shows up somewhere

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
That it's going to take a while for the

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Pirates to figure out

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
What is being watermarked

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I think if you just cram name and number in the file

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
That's not going to be enough

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
And if they're not doing it that way that idea

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Is copyright

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
2009 Jamie

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
That's right

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Put a little watermark on it right now

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I'm saying right now that's my idea

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
That's a very interesting way around it though

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
So there you go

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
We'll see what happens with this

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
You know obviously steam has a lot of power

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
So far I suppose you could say

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
So it will be interesting to see

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Kind of the impact that this ultimately has

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
On the PC gaming and the PC

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Piracy scene

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Well in other PC news

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
And piracy

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
God this is going to make it so easy for the pirates

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
But who cares

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Sims 3 is not going to use the DRM

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
It's actually going to

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Just use a key code

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
A CD key

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
That will be broken in about 5 seconds

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I know

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
But then again

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
It's seriously with as many people

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Complain about DRM

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
It's really going to be the best way

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I think right now to at least

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
You know

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Please some of the players

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
So

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Although I love

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Love what the guy said about it

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
There's a quote from

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Trying to see

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Who the person is

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Rod Humble

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Who is the executive producer

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Saying

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
We feel that this is a good time proven solution

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Which makes it easy for you to play the game without

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
DRM methods

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
That feel overly invasive or leave you concerned

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
About authorization server access

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
In the distant future

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I agree to that

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Extent you won't have to worry about

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Being authorized every time you play it

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
You won't have to worry about

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
You know having to

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Be online to play it but at the same

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Time it is

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Going to mean that they're going to find a lot

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
More

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I suppose hacked versions out there

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
You know that people are going to be breaking

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Those codes

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
That's good I didn't want to buy that game anyways

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm buying it

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I need to make more houses

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I need to burn more people

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I need to drown more people in the pool

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
And then turn the lawn into a graveyard

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
That's even better

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
And then the people who move in

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Are like haunted

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
There needs to be more vampires in Sims 3

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
And aliens

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
And um

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Mutant powers

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
So it'll be Sims X3

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Okay

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
But not a crappy sequel

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Dear god no

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Anyways

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
There's some pretty interesting stuff

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I mean we've already seen this with the

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Xbox 360 but now Netflix

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Is kind of branching out to other

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Game systems to see

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
You know maybe there's

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Potential interest in

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Streaming to theirs

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
For example the Playstation 3

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
There was a survey going around

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Asking people what their

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
If they'd be interested in something

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Like the service that they have

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Right now on the Xbox 360

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
On the Playstation 3

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
However it'd be a little bit different

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
What would happen is you'd actually have

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
To purchase a Netflix

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Instant streaming disc for a one time fee

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Of $10 and since this can be

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Put into your

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Drive and then basically install

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
The run off there and then you have to

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Connect your PS3 to the internet

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
And you'd be able to stream

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
All sorts of stuff to it

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
All different movies

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
And could this perhaps

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Mean that we're going to see Netflix

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Coming to other systems?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Maybe? I don't know

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I think they're going to go where the money is so

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Why not?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Huh

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
It's just interesting though because I think

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
In our minds we all assume that Playstation 3

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Will go with a competitor like Blockbuster

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Or something else so it's kind of interesting

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
That Netflix could essentially end up

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Having Monopoly pretty soon

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
On the high end systems

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Yeah

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Well it may not just be a monopoly with the high end systems

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It may be a monopoly with the

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
New gen systems you know whatever you want to call

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
The Wii as well and that is that

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
There's a survey going around

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Apparently hinting that there could be a Netflix

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Service for the Wii in the future

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Apparently this is

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Some type of survey

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Going around that's asking

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
If they would be

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Interested in a Netflix

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Sorry Netflix instant

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Streaming disc

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Apparently this would be a disc that you would

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Put in the Wii when you want to use the Netflix

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Streaming service and it's

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Not something that would come automatically with a firmware

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Update so I'm not sure if you have to buy this for a fee

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Or if it would be very low cost or something you could order

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
From Netflix no idea

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Very

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Interesting to see if this would actually

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Be something that would happen

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Oh no I'm sorry I'm looking at

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
It in the survey it says a one time fee

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Of ten dollars for the Netflix instant

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Streaming disc and then your Wii would be connected to the

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Internet

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
So it could be that Netflix

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Could automatically show up on the Wii the

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
PS3 and the Xbox 360

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
All at once and they would kind of dominate the streaming

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Video market I don't know if this would

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Necessarily be a bad thing I mean you know

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Netflix has a pretty big library but of course little

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Competitions healthy too one thing

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I think Netflix suffers from is they don't have

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
A lot of big big stuff in

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Their streaming library and I know they've talked about

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Adding stuff later on for a higher fee but

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
They don't get a lot of brand

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
New stuff if it's not an obscure

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Indie film or a

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Documentary which don't get me wrong those aren't necessarily

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Bad but some days you want to

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Watch the big action shoot them up too and those things are

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Never available instantly right away for

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Many many many years so

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I don't know I think

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
A little competition would be healthy if one of the other services

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Would get involved at the same time if Netflix

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Hopefully can get some of the newer stuff on

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Their service it could be pretty awesome so

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
We'll see

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
We'll see if this uh

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Survey of course surveys can sometimes be meaningless

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It's just a survey don't take it too seriously

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
And the survey says

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Who knows

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Well how about something a little different

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Sure

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
More stuff out of game developers conference

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Yay

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
The legend of Zelda

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Spirit tracks

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
It's sort of the makes me think of ice cream

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
You know what's

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
The one moose tracks

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Is that I don't know

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I want ice cream I think

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Ice cream sounds delicious

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
I have one ice cream cone in the house

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
And I'm so eating it during break

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
You bitch don't hate me

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Okay only if you buy me pie

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
We'll see

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Anywhere

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Anywhere

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks is

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Another cell

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Shaded link game

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
But um

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
He's

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Got a train

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I guess with a cannon

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I have no idea

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I'm looking at some of this and it's just weird

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
But it looks like it's gonna be

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
On the Nintendo DS

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Is it supposed to be some

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Type of like training

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Game or what is this

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
He's got a freaking train

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Haven't they called this a rail shooter game or something?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Is what this is supposed to be

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Link on a train

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Seriously

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
It's just gonna be a standard Zelda game

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
It's just people are basing their

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Information off of what they see in the trailer

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
And speculating

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Okay now there's no water

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
But he's wearing a conductor's outfit in every darn scene you see him in

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Maybe he likes it

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Maybe it makes him feel sexy inside

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I don't know

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Maybe he's worn out the

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Link on a train

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I think Frisbee in chat sums it up

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
There's a song that would describe this game

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Come on ride the train

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
And ride it woo woo

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
That should be the song they use in the trailer

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I was thinking of Snakes on a Plane

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Or Snakes on a Train

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Wasn't that a direct to DVD version or something like that?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
It was a knock off video

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Alright well

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I don't know

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I guess more to come on this

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Probably at E3

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I'm assuming this is gonna be playable at E3

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
We'll find out more about this

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
When they're hurting there's a new Zelda game right?

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I don't know

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Yeah so

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Along with that of course we have

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
A little bit more Zelda

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Information including another

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Zelda coming to Virtual Console

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
In Japan but you know

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
It's gonna be coming everywhere else eventually I'm sure

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Actually

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
In April we're gonna be getting

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
On Virtual Console

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Also expected out on

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Sega Master System Phantasy Star

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
For the PC Engine

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Ninja Gaiden

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Also

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Part of the Virtual Console Arcade

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Genpai

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Terma Den and Space Invaders

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
And then

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
For the Super Famicom Kirby's Dream Land 3

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
And

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Let's see here

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
And then Castlevania 3

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
On the Famicom

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
So that's kinda cool

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
But I'm sure we'll see stuff

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
In other regions probably around the same time

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I do want to point out though Phantasy Star is in that Ultimate Genesis Collection

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
You can get all of them

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
For like 30 bucks and you know

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I would never pay 5 dollars

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
For just Phantasy Star when I know this is out there

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
With all the Phantasy Star games

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
For like 30 bucks

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Just saying

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Well their prices are a little high anyways

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
If you ask me

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Anyhow

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Look one thing that always kinda pissed me off

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
About Virtual Consoles is that there was no place on the damn Wii

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
To store all of these Virtual Console games

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
That sometimes I want to download

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
And especially add WiiWare into it

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
And the storage capacity on the Wii stinks

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
And you might remember people have been bitching about this

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
For a long time and what was it last like

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Freaking September or October

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
This guy that worked for Nintendo came out and said

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Nobody cares about that

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Just geeks know Taku

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Are the only people that care about this and I said F you buddy

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
May I?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Yeah exactly I said F you buddy

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
If that's gonna be your attitude then I

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Ban myself from Virtual Console

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I'm not downloading any more stuff

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Cause I'll tell you what I had like 3 screens full of Virtual Console

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Crap before that point I don't know how I fit it all in there

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Mostly little NES games

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I said you know the hell with this

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
If that's gonna be your attitude then I ban

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Virtual Console until Nintendo addresses

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
This issue and guess what?

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Finally

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
All these months later

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Yes my boycott has come to an end

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Because they did announce at Game Developers Conference

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
In 2009 that the Wii Shop channel

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Would be updated with the SD Card

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Menu that would allow you 20 pages

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Of games on the

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
SD Card without having to

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Copy it back and forth like you did

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Before you could actually boot the damn game

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
From the SD Card and now

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Not necessarily though

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Also let me say this not just

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Can you do 2GB

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
SD Cards which is a lot of room to begin with

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Especially compared to what's on the Wii to begin with

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
You can now run up to 32GB

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
SD Cards in the slot

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Loki what were you gonna say?

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Technically it's not necessarily running off the

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
SD Card it's copying them to the Wii

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Memory so that is one little

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Asterisk on there you need to have

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Free memory on your Wii's

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Internal storage

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
However though if you get an SD Card

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
That's big enough just copy everything to the damn

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
SD Card at least all the games

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
You know save files I'm sure it'll be enough

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
But it alleviates the problem of having to go

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Into the memory manager every single time

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Which was stupid and I know a lot of people were

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Emailing me saying Rob you should just copy things in the memory

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I said no no that's stupid because it needs to be

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Part of this whole seamless thing you know

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
You're making excuses for Nintendo

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Having these big ideas

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
With what they want to do with the download service

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
And then not having the space to put it all

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
So you're making excuses so

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Nintendo needs to address this directly make it very

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Seamless make it easy and they

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Finally did so there you go

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
And so of course if you were listening early in the show I talked about

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I played Bit.Trip Beat I also played

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Gradius Rebirth I didn't play it enough

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I went on a buying binge to buy

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Some of the things I missed out on

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
While my boycott was going on so

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
There you go

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
That happens from time to time sorry

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
What is this

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Did you talk about your video right?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Yeah sometimes when you punch somebody they bounce

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Back and they knock you open into the air

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Anyways sorry back to the show

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
And Dr. Tutti in chat says as long as you leave enough

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
To load your biggest VC game should be an issue

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
You're right but all I do I copy all

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
My games to the SD card now and I'll have

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Plenty of room on the

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Wii I would like to point

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Out and this is not unfortunately

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
A positive point for

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Nintendo they've already figured out

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
How to crack this already

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
And now of course you can

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Still load you know the 4.0

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Firmware for your Wii

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
And still be able to install mods that

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Are pirated and stuff and copy them all to your

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
SD cards and that sort of thing

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
But it does alleviate you know

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Room so people can actually download more

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Of your Wiiware stuff

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Hmm

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Alright well let's go to Twitter

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
And we do a little segment here on the show called

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Show us your tweets and

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
We like to ask questions on Twitter and then you guys

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Answer them and we read some of our favorite responses

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Here on the show and we actually

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Asked you guys just a little bit before the show started

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Tonight we wanted to know

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
How you kind of felt about these Nintendo announcements

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
At GDC

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
We specifically asked did Nintendo's announcements

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
At GDC show a commitment

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
To us core gamers

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Or are you not satisfied? Here's some of the answers we got

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
On Twitter which is a little

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Bit diverse here

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Let's see

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
We've got

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Poor Leno111

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Says to me the train plus Zelda equals

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Fail I wish they would just go back to the old school

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Style of Zelda

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Ryan Belknap says

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Just should be happy they said anything at all

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
They could have kept it for E3

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Joy says with the new games and support

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
For a bigger SD card I think it's a great move

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
But I know tons of people will still complain

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Scruffy K says no I think Nintendo

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Is trying to keep the core gamers from deserting them

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
A Zelda in the hands is good as two

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
In production

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Act Def says while nobody expected

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Those announcements by Nintendo's part

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I'm still waiting for a real core gamer

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Announcement for E3 or I hope so

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Crows said

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Nintendo will never satisfy me until they

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Make a new Star Fox game that is not full of suck

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Deep Man says besides the

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
SD card thing I don't think I saw anything that

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Impressed me from Nintendo this week

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
There you go

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Some of the answers from our

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Show us your tweets segment

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
We're on twitter.com under OLR

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
And we like to post questions for you guys to answer

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Before the show

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Let's move on we do have a couple more

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Nintendo stories out of

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Game developers conference I almost said

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
E3

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
We're a little bit

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Stuck right now though so why don't I go ahead and just

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Take this next one

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
So the next story would be about

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Sorry we got some live issues going on

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Live radio folks

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
It's called Jamie's computer is a piece of crap

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
That's alright well Jamie would have been excited to tell you

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
About the virtual console arcade that was

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Also announced at game developers conference

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And is now just

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Loading?

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Well then tell them what arcade games they can be looking forward to

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Well hey there's all kinds of cool

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Stuff that you can be looking forward to

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
In fact I would

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Actually even say if you are a Namco

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Fan then you're going to

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Be supremely pleased

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Now something that people should know

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
This is like now it's kind of

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Like in a way they're adding a new system

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
To the virtual console

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
But that system is arcade games

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Name for the Wii basically

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
There's actually four games that are available

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Now there's

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Gapless which is Namco Bondi

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
For 600 Wii points

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Mappy we love Mappy

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Annoying little freaking game that is

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
It's alright

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
500 Wii points there's

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Tower of Druago which is

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
500 Wii points also available now

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Star Force from Tecmo

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
500 points and then

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
We have a Sega game coming out

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Which is my number three favorite game

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Evar

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Space Harrier

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Hi

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And then

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
From Namco Bondi

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Again though

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I'm a little torn because

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Didn't a lot of these Namco games show up

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
In these various Namco collections they

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Seem to put out on every system?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Some have not

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
And also other ones that are listed on here

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Where we

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Not seeing any too much else

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Listed in the announcement list

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Was Emeralda

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
There's also

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
The Return of Ishtar

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
So hey

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Here's the mistake I don't want to make

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
It's very similar to the Sonic Genesis collection

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I'm pretty sure I heard something about

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Namco's putting out some type of new compilation

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
On the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
There's a new thing coming out for that

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
So if that is going to have Mappy

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
And some of these games in it

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
When that collection is going to be

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
$30 maybe $40 tops

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Why would I buy one game

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
For 500 points when this is likely to

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
And again I don't know a lot about it

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
There's one being developed

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Why would I do that?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Why wouldn't I just go buy the PS3 one

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Just like I would say go buy the Sonic Genesis collection

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I would actually buy

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Individual games on here

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Because I don't know if you remember this is an old example

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
You remember when I was scrambling

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Like a chicken with a head cut off

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
To try to find the entire Namco

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Playstation series

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
And I think I'm like

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Missing the O

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
So I have some of the rare ones

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
For the trademark symbol that was only on Japan

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Or the restricted symbol or whatever

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
But there's games on those compilations

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
That I wanted that we didn't get on the

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
US versions you know

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
And it would be far cheaper for me

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
To have my compilation and then

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Just get the couple of them that I don't have

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
You know so like

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
For Tower of Druaga you know

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
True I have that on the Playstation

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
One but

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
It's not always convenient to hook up

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
You know my Playstation

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Or deal with you know backwards compatibility

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Or any of that

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I can see that I can see that and you know like something like

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
A Space Harrier as much as you love that game

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I can see why you would want to get that

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
And you know I'd have 50,000

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I seriously can name off

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Multiple versions of Space Harrier that I have

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
And what's one more right what's one more

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Like I've got it on Saturn

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I have it on PC Engine

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I've got it on 32X

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Ok it's only a 3 hour show

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
The 32X version is arcade perfect by the way

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Insert coin instead of press start

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Nice

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
But I was going to say you know and I think one thing

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
That I don't believe made our show roll tonight is about

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
The Final Fantasy games

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
All the old ones are going to be

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
They were officially announced that they're coming to Virtual Console

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I'll pay the money for Final Fantasy 4 and 6 again

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Even though I already own those games

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I own 6 the cartridge

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Somewhere and I own 4

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Final Fantasy 5

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I got 4 on the Wonderswan Color

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Of all things I've got 4 on

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
You know the DS

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I've got 4 you know

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I'll buy it again on Super Nintendo that's how much I fucking love that game

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Especially

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Especially if they release

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Although I have a feeling we're going to get the Bastard Eyes 2

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
That was the first release here because it is Virtual Console

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
But especially if we got like the Japanese retranslation

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Oh my god I'd be so excited

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I'd be so excited

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
If I had a perfect translation of Final Fantasy 3

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I would be freaking in heaven

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
But you know what game that I totally wish

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
That they would bring out

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
That would be translated as Seiken Densetsu 3

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Oh

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Hi people there is an officially

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
There's a fully

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Sprite hacked everything

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Translated version out there just say

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Let us use that please

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Or just fucking use it because it was your game in the first place

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
You know what I mean

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I think they would have every right to just use it

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
You know what I mean

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
What could the translators do

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Gee sorry we you know kind of like

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Copied your game and ROM dumped it

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
In the entirety of the internet right

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
That would totally not get

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Nintendo any friends

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
But still

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
But still my point is

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
There that it exists

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
People did this in their spare time

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Why can't Nintendo pay someone and just

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Crank it out you know

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Pay them a dollar

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I don't think we'll see that ever

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
You know on a

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Well we may eventually see it but

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Never say never we did get Final Fantasy 5

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Eventually

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
That's true

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Eventually

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Never say never with Second Detsetsu

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Never say never

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
And that could be a thing that they would

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Be holding back for E3 but you know

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I don't want to get anyone's hopes up

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
And I doubt it but you know

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
You never know

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
That and Earthbound are like the two

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Things they could pull out of their pants

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
And lay on the table and they would just like

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Oh my god Fandagasm

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Seriously it would be so much wank

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
For real

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Speaking of so much wank

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Oh

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
There's another game that will not be coming

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
To a Nintendo console soon

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
At least not through legitimate means

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
But now thanks to a

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Coding competition there is

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
A new application Kamasutra

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
For the DS

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Yes with this you can actually see

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Visual representations of all the different

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Kamasutra positions

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
And can learn about the pros and cons

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Of them

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
No they'll release it in the states they'll just call it sex training

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Yes my personal trainer

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Kamasutra

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
They'll just rename it yoga for adults

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
My personal trainer butt sex

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Wait is the gay Kamasutra

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Part of this?

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I don't know

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I had it downloaded I just haven't gotten a chance to load it on my

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Card yet

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
There's actually some other neat things that came out

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
But I can't remember what they were

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Um

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Robert M in chat is kind of referencing our

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Last little bit there we were talking about Earthbound

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
And how it would just become fanboy wank all over the place

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
If that was announced for E3 and Robert M says

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Didn't Black Wolf say Earthbound would not be

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Coming to Virtual Console due to the pop

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Culture references? True and Bobby

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Did make a very good point and I'm not gonna

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
You know deny that there's a lot of shit they got

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Away with 15 years ago they probably couldn't get away

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
With now especially with Wii getting sued as much as it does

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
However if they

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Wanted to take the time to go back and recode

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Some things and redo some things which you know

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Wouldn't be that much time at all considering

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
How much this would sell

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
And then just kind of not tell people that

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
When they announce Earthbound that they oh yeah

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And we changed it a lot

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
They'll still be wank all over the place

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
They did the same thing with

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Tecmo Bowl, Wave Race 64

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Yeah I mean it's not unheard of for them to change

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Games

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Granted there'd be a lot to change

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
But they could do it and probably make a killing

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
On Virtual Console they just wouldn't advertise

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
That they went back and changed stuff cause all the purists

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Would be up in arms but it's

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Better than nothing right?

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
The purists would be up in arms

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Anyway and you know what to hell with it

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
As long as we get it

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
It depends how much they mess with it

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
For me but we'll see

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
More stuff out of Game Developer Conference

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
And this is also from Nintendo

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
A game called Rock and Roll Climber

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Yeah Rock and Roll Climber

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Not to be confused with Crazy Climber

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
That's a much different game

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Ice Climber or Rock and Roll Racing

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Although maybe you could unlock

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Ice Climber in this game

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
What are you talking about?

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
What you talking about Loki?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
What about Rock and Roll Racing or Snake and Roll

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
No this is a whole new game

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Whole new IP so props to them for doing a new

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
IP but it's called Rock and Roll

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Climber it's a balance board game

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
That you use the balance board and

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
The Wiimote and Nunchuck and you do

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
These arm movements to climb up a wall

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
The balance board reads your leg movements

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
The Wiimote and Nunchuck read your

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Arm movements and

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Apparently here's the weird thing

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Once you get to the top you get a guitar

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
And you play a riff

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
So I'm assuming

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
There's some type of music

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Fusion with this game I know they didn't say

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
A lot at GDC maybe this is one of the things

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
They're going to be showing more at E3 but I imagine

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
They're incorporating I mean to call the game Rock and Roll

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Climber they're probably incorporating

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Music into this now maybe it's that you have to climb

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
On beat or something like that I don't know it could be

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Anything but I'm sure we'll see more of this

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
You have to wail hard

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Just flail about aimlessly

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
I'm sure there's some type of rhythm

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I'm still waiting for Air Guitar Hero

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
We just don't know

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
They have an air guitar mode in Guitar Hero

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
It's actually an air guitar machine

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
It just takes away the instruments

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
That they have

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Anyhow there you go Rock and Roll Climber

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Coming out probably

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
This summer or something

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
I may add it looked like crap

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Also and it's a WiiWare title

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
And it looked like oh I didn't even

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Catch that it's WiiWare? It's WiiWare

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
It's absolute crap

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
And everyone's like

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Oh maybe it's the sequel to Ice Climber

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
No they would never do anything that cool

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Because then if

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
They just kicked that guy in the face

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Dark Tetsuya

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
You make horrible radio when you reference it

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Dark Tetsuya says Sky the game kind of gives me a vibe

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Of the old school NES version where it's just

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Cute congrats on beating the level animation

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Well maybe

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
That's basically it it's just another way to say

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Look it's another thing you can use the Wii Fit board for

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
You can be fit and climb walls

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Because people like climbing walls

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
The whole guitar thing sort of

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Really makes me go back to a

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Strong bad

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Thing with the cheat

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Here the tort have a trophy

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I'm sorry I only want to climb walls

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
If I'm going to be chased by an American Gladiator

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
While I do so

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
There should be Frank mode where you can climb a

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Button and then it falls on you and you die

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And if you catch that reference you're awesome

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I caught that reference and I don't even know

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
What it's from

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Well I do know what it's from but I've never even seen the source material

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Alright forget it

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Let's move on

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
How about something crazy

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And something that we already have in America

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
But hey our friends in the UK are finally getting it

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
You get Dementium

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Where you can be Looney

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Looney

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Dementium the ward

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's for the DS

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
It will be out on April 17th

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Two days before my birthday

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
But yeah we've had it since October

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And it's been in Japan

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Since summer

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
But if you want to be in a

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Survival horror game

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Where you can fight spooky

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Monsters in a

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Mental hospital

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And not know how you got there

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Get this game

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
How's that?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Wow that's a great sales pitch

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Thank you

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
You get to be chased by monsters in the hospital

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
And it's not Silent Hill

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I'm sure the makers of that game really appreciate you

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
For that little summary there

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
They're not even around anymore

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Well they are around but they're not even Gamecock anymore

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
It's South Peak now

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Not quite as cool

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Didn't they get absorbed as part of the economy?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Gamecock has been inserted into another company

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
You're so mature

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
As we hinted earlier that the possible outcome of my console

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I may remind you Rob

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
This console has died once

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And come back to life

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
It's the Jesus console

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Did it take you three days to revive it?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Yes it did actually

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
But

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
There is some striking

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Infrural

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I guess

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Questionnaires that have been filled out

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And people's input put in place

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Both Joystick and Engadget

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Have run polls regarding the E74 error

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Which is

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
As Microsoft puts it

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
A general hardware error

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Hmmmm

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
General hardware error

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
You say

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
That's funny because there's

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Three lights of death I guess

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
There's also a general hardware error

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And we don't see many of those anymore

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Hmmmm

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And then all of a sudden

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
After the new Xbox experience

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Was installed

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
We started seeing a lot more of these E74 errors

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
In fact the dramatic increase of them

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
What's interesting though

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Is people are kind of

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Getting all conspiracy theory mode here

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And thinking

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Microsoft has

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Specifically stated that they're gonna

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Warranty these three

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Red light

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Errors

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
But the E74 errors are not

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Part of that three year warranty

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
They're just part of the one year warranty

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Is this a way for Microsoft to get out of

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Warrenting those consoles that would normally be

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Under the red ring

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But now they have reprogrammed the error

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Displaying to just do this

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
E74 error instead of the three red lights

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Is kind of a way to save some money if you think about it

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
So it's actually the same

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Same errors but

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
He's played a different way

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
This is all conspiracy though

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Here's my question about the polling

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And my initial thought when I saw these polls

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Is how accurate is this

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
To post this on a video game website

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Have you had this problem yes or no

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
How many people are actually gonna click yes

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
To that survey as opposed to those that are gonna

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Click no because they're pissed off

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I think for that reason alone

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
The statistic is skewed completely

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
The problem I think is

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
It's relevant to show that there's a point there

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
That it is happening

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And it's happening frequently

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
But it's not happening nearly as much as the sites say they are

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I think this way of polling people

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Is not statistically so

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I don't know what the actual statistics are

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I do know that there are a lot more of them now

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Than there were before

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Which is a little kind of huh you know

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And then a lot less red rings to death

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And granted you can say okay maybe they're improving the hardware

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
But I have a feeling that

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I would not be surprised if this is actually what's going on

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But no one's ever gonna admit to it

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
They're not gonna say oh yeah we changed it

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
So that you know we don't have to pay out on the warranties

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Yeah like they would actually do that

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And you know admit to it

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
There'd be all sorts of lawsuits

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
But

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I've actually you know

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Most of my consoles have died either

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
With the three rings to death

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I've only had one that didn't die that way

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And it never actually popped up in error message

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
In the video so if it did

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I would have never known

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
But I'm not surprised

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
That something like this is going on

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
But who knows

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I mean this may become the new red ring to death thing

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And you know now it's the E74 error

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And it also could be you know

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
A way to say hey look

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
You know statistics

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Are the three ring errors you know now

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
You know drop down to nothing you know

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So hey look we're doing good

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
But really they're just kind of

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
You know shuffling to the side

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
That's shady I hope it's just a conspiracy

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
You're talking about there

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Tigerclaw in chat makes a good point

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Microsoft will have to repair the console with the E74 errors

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Regardless they don't want to end up with more bad PR

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Isn't that true? One way or another they're going to have to fix them anyway

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
But these consoles are past

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
That's the thing though

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
They don't have to fix them because there's a three year warranty

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
But if all these consoles start showing up

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
With the E74 aren't they

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
You know if they're newer consoles or what have you

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Aren't they going to have to fix them anyway

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
If they're in the one year warranty otherwise

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
You have to pay $100 to fix it

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
That's where they get you because it's not the three rings

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
But it would be just like before

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
They were trying to charge $100 to all these people

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
With the red rings and the internet revolted

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Isn't that same thing going to happen? Yeah but prove it

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I mean that's the thing they're going to have to prove it

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
That that's actually going on

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And I just find it a little shady that there's this

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Error message that has the same description

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
As this other error message

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
That's you know really bad you know

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
It's like well it's a general

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Hardware failure

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Okay what's that mean you know

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Is this any different than the three rings

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Well it's a general hardware failure of

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
The graphics chip or the

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Scaler chip or something else

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Well that's exactly what the other one was

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
So

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
How's this any different? Oh it's not

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Okay

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I don't know I just hope I don't ever get one of these

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I hope not either or there will be hell to pay

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
On the show just like when I got the red rings

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I was so pissed about that thankfully

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I went out of town

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Anyhow we got some release dates we got to cover

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And I'll start off in Japan with the Japanese

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Release dates and talking about the Xbox 360

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Eleven Eyes crossover

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Is coming out in Japan

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
This is not a game I've heard of I'm wondering if it's just

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
A

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Localized version of one of our titles

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
But it doesn't look like it looks like this is a new

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Type of game I guess it's based on an anime

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Because it looks like there's eleven chicks that this game

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Stars it is an adventure

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
What was it again? It's called

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Eleven Eyes crossover

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Huh

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
So I don't know

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
What do you think of that three by three eyes?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I think it's different

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
On the Playstation 3 winning post world is a game coming out from Koei

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
This week on April the 2nd

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Dwalla de Wii winning post world

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Also comes out on the Wii

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Whoa whoa is that Dwalla?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
That's the

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Mascot

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Yeah a little koala bear for their team

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Yeah that's cute

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So I'm assuming that's like a little baseball game that's coming out of there

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
No they're calling it a party game

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So maybe it's like a baseball party game

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Sports party

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Who knows

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So that's pretty cool

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Yeah I think our friend that we both have on LiveJournal

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Deanna who's been spending a lot of time over in Japan

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I think I've seen pictures of her with that character

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Yeah I actually

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
A while back I had like a little

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Keychain thing that someone sent me

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So I thought it was cool

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Oh

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Winning post world also makes its way to the Playstation 2

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
This is hitting multiple systems this week

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I'm not exactly sure exactly what

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Oh this is

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Oh it's a horse racing game

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I was gonna say is it the same thing as winning 11

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
But it's not it's a horse racing game

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
But it looks pretty intricate

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Soccer on horses that's awesome

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Isn't that just polo?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
No that's croquet on horses

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Yeah that'd be croquet on horses

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
That's a very good description of polo

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Croquet on horses

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Why is it not more popular here?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
It sounds kinda awesome

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Now what would you call it like if you had like one of those fantasy

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Games where it's actual

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Horses playing croquet

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Would that still be considered polo?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Because you know it's a horses playing

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
The game I think it would be considered a fucking miracle

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
It would be an anamorphic croquet

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Anyhow

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
On the Nintendo DS

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Coming out in Japan on the 2nd of April

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Disney fairies Tinkerbell comes out

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
As well as another pechi slot game from

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Durasu also pro

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Yaku Famitsa DS

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
2009 comes out from Bandai Namco

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Which is yet another baseball game

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Coming out from Namco with little

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Chibi characters in it

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
On the Playstation portable

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Which is the last system we cover over there

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
The Legend of Heroes

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
A lot of them move into

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Price reductions

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And that's really it unless you want to get some new

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Covers for your PS in black, silver

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And white, that's really it

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So I guess Tinker, yes

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
As AlphaCananagram in chat says fuck yes

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Tinkerbell definitely seems to be

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
One of the highlights on the Japanese release calendar

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
This week, things look a little better next week though

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
It's a slow week

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Is it? Yes

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
How about going in another direction?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
How about it? For our friends in the UK

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000

Well this one doesn't have a date on it

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
It might have already come out

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000

Alright

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Well in the US

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
There's not a whole lot coming out this week

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
In fact a lot of it's crap

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
But that's okay

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Because where there's crap

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
There's crap I guess

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
There is no positive there

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
The flowers grow? Yeah the flowers grow

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Speaking of flowers! Gardening Marla

Any interest in Gardening Marla or is this

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
You haven't heard of Jumping the Shark yet

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000

She's gonna make crafts

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000

Where Marla's in a role playing game

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I wanna see Godzilla vs Marla

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I wanna see DM Marla

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Where she's running the game

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
There you go

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Don't worry Marla will fix it

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
She slays the dragon

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
We've got Don King Boxing coming out on the Wii

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000

Coming from Atlas for the DS

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Our music fans will love this

Major Miners Majestic March coming out on the Wii

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
You may remember the creators of Parappa the Rapper

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
created this

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Oh yes I do

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Marching Band

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Bobby you listening?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
It's a marching band game

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I was in marching band

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Me too but Bobby still does it

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I know he plays drums

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
and shows

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
musicals

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
that come through his town

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I could swear

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
and he's gonna pop and chat any minute I'm sure

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I could swear he talked about Drum Corps

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
he still does stuff now and again with that

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and that's kind of marching band

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000

No nudity in that game

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
so I have no interest in it whatsoever

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000

Disney characters now

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
this isn't a game but I thought I'd mention it because it's pretty cool

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Mad Catz has a new charging

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
dock coming out that charges

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
two controllers but what makes it special

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
though is it's the Rayman Rabbids

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
charging dock so there's a Rabbid

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
sitting there yelling at you

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
unfortunately it doesn't make noise because that would be awesome

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
and then

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
one last game coming out a week from today

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Rhythm Heaven and of course

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
a tie along with that

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Nintendo DSi coming out in black and blue

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
so

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
well that's why this is a slow

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
week because you have those two bombshells coming out

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
yes the DSi

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
is going to be pretty big

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
and then

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
that's pretty much it for right now

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
wow

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
now of course us talking about the Mama games

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
you spawned everybody in chat

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
talking about Mama in games

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
this is definitely my favorite Mama game

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I mean we had 2DX Mama

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
we have Pop'n Music 18

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Mama, Mama in Space

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Neon Mama in Evangelion

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
my favorite though

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
from GS68 this is definitely my favorite Mama title

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Mama vs. Capcom

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
that's pretty

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
scary

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I was going to mention there is one more thing

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
this will make Jamie happy coming out

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
it's not a

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
game you can buy in the stores

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
online on Xbox Live Arcade

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
this week Outrun

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
yay

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
yes new Outrun game is going to be coming out

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
that's not old school Outrun getting upgraded

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Outrun online arcade

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
but now see

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
that could be yay or that could be OMG Suck

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
if Yuji Naka is involved

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
it'll be good

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
the screenshots I've seen of it look pretty awesome

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
and they do some

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
neat camera stuff where

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
when you're drifting around some of the bends

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
it actually looks really cool

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
and Cell Factor Psychokinetic Wars

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I could use a fun silly little

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
racing game that's not too serious

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
like a lot of the Xbox 360 racing games are too serious

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
for me I could use a fun silly little one

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
there's a bunch of stuff that's listed on here

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
that's supposedly coming out this week I'm not sure if all this is

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Banjo-Tooie they're saying

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I don't know that sounds kind of weird

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I know one of these titles that's on this Kotaku

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
list is not correct Duke Nukem Trilogy

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
that's not coming out until September

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
it's funny it's coming out April 1st

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
you're the fool

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
because it's not coming out yet

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
what a Duke Nukem title delayed?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
never

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
sorry that's alright

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
alright so we got

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
one more story for you guys then we're going to get to our classic

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
game of the week and this has to do with

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Left 4 Dead which a lot of people

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I know in our Steam community are still playing Left 4 Dead

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
this is a game I need to spend more quality time

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
with I played it for like a little bit and I found out

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I suck at first person shooters really bad

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
but I need to go try to get a little better

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
however there is a new

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
download content pack coming out for

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Left 4 Dead and it's coming out on April

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
21st for Xbox 360 gamers

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
and it's going to have a new

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
survival mode and

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
just wave after wave of zombies

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and versus campaign support

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
with two more maps Dead Air and

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Death Toll

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
by the way it's free so check that out

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
we like free things

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
right? free is awesome

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
except Yaris

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
okay we're just about to the

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
end of the show but of course no show

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
here at Orange Laundry will be complete

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
without the classic game of the week

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
actually we're only like half way done I don't want you to think

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
we're like actually done but we like to end part A

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
with the classic video game of the week

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Dark Sakura goes through her dusty archives

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
of games and finds a game or two

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
maybe that she thinks you ought to be playing

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
and so Dark Sakura

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
what is your classic

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
game of the week?

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
my classic game of the week is Twinbee

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
which

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
of course we saw

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
a while back what

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
it's labeled as Rainbow Bell

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I always remembered it as Twinbee so

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
whatever

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
is that familiar?

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
anybody that's played

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
the Bimani games long enough have heard some

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
form of the Twinbee theme in the game

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
this is the thing that annoys

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
me about Twinbee

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
is that every time you get a damn power up

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
it plays that little noise

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and starts moving it over

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
but anyway Twinbee is a game where you

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
play as a little ship with arms

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
and you shoot

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
bells for your power ups and you change the color

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
of your bell

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
actually they pop out of the clouds and you shoot the clouds

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
and the bells will change color and you'll get a different

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
power up

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
but you just have to keep shooting it until

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
you

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
until you

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
get the one that you want but if you keep shooting it

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
it'll change into a symbol that will kill you

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
so

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
you can play as

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
you've got two characters in here you can play as

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
and it came out

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
for the Famicom

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
and it came out actually in the cartridge and disk format

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
the MSX

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
it came out, it was of course arcade

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
and

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
then we also saw Twinbee

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
portable for the Sony PSP

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
and the Konami Classic series

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
arcade hits for the Nintendo DS

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
now

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I bring up Twinbee because Twinbee

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
leads to

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
actually

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
the one that I like better than this

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
can I say this though in chat real quick we have somebody saying

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
isn't this Stinger?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
yes you got to do Stinger

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
so in the US it was called Stinger

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
yeah in the US it was Stinger

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
but now let's

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
move forward

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
sure let me queue up the other game here

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
tell them a little bit about this

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
now this is the one that I like better and one that my husband

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and I played the crap out of last night

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
is Detana Twinbee

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
which

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
is

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
they actually came out in Europe

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
as bells and whistles

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
so anyway

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
this is the sequel to the original Twinbee

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
but the arcade

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
and Famicom versions and it plays

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
pretty much the same but it has

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
much much better graphics

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
and music in Project MC

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
yeah I've never seen

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
this game before this is pretty sweet

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
for an old school like 16 bit

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
era game this is pretty sweet

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
it also had little cut scenes that were in between

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
levels where you could see different

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
characters hanging around

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
actually one person plays as Twinbee

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
the other one plays as Winbee

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
and you can also get

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
a ghost

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
pilot which was

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
oh god

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
now I can't remember what it was called

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
it's definitely not in the article I'm looking at

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
but the green one

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
no I never played this game enough

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
oh but anyway you can also get

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
like a sort of ghost pilot that will hang out with you

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
um

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
and uh

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
it brings in the pilots of Twinbee and Winbee

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
which is Light and Pastel

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
um

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
also it's um you can actually get this game

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
in the Twinbee deluxe pack

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
for Playstation and Saturn

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
could be portable for Playstation portable

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
PSP sorry um

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
the version that I linked here is the PC

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Engine version um

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
it also came out on the

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
X68000

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
and um

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
it's actually um out

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
um on Virtual Console

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
now so you can get it too

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
um

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
another thing that was cool about this one

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
is that it actually led to um

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
a Twinbee

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
OVO

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
that was actually kind of cool

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
but yeah this

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
whenever I think of Twinbee this is the game I actually think of

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
because it was so much fun

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
like some of the power ups you can get are so cool

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
like you've got a shadow

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I think the shadow is if you hit

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
no red is you get a barrier

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
um purple is the um

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
the multiple

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
image following after you

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
and then you can get like you know

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
different directional shots you can extend your shot

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
you can get all kinds of different

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
you can actually get shadows

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
that follow you behind too

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
um you also have a charge move where you can shoot

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
out like a big stream of fire

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
and if you use your bomb button you can target

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
things that are on the ground

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
and shoot um

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
things that are on

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
the ground

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
like that with bombs

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
um but this is

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
to me this is probably

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
one of the pinnacle of

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
um shooting games

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
really is

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
and it's cute

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
and it's super cute

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
but don't don't don't

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
you know think differently because it's cute

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
it gets hard

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
you get flying like

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
looks can be deceiving

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
where I died is when all these freaking chickens appear in air

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
and run at you

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
you know I think I died in Zelda that way once

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
seriously it's like oh flying around

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
chickens run

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
dead die

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
yeah

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and of course it's got beautiful voices too

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
and the music in it is freaking fantastic

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
so it's Detina Twinbee

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
alright there it is

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Konami give us a new Twinbee

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
there it is folks your classic game of the week

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Twinbee, Stinger, Rainbow, Bell

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
more importantly the game

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
that inspired Detina Twinbee

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
for the PC Engine

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
there it is your classic game of the week

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
that's going to be a hard one for folks to find

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
last week was easy you did what Secret of Mana

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
two weeks ago because we weren't here last week

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
you did Secret of Mana two weeks ago right?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
if you've got money

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
or virtual console now

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I was really referring to playing it on the sneeze

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
alright well there you go

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I will say

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
you can get a PC Engine

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
core graphics for not

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
too much money if you know where to look

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
which would be where are you going to share?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
was it

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Pink Elephant I think

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
was the company

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
oh that was it

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
oh the folks that were at PAX

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
we got ours at Classic Gaming Expo

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
a while back so I'll see if I can't find the name of it

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
and put it up on the forum

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
oh my god you've got an SUV on a building

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
anyway

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
my

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
that's awesome

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
okay I'm being distracted by falling cars

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
but also the HuCard for Twinbee

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
actually shouldn't be that

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
expensive if you

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
have someone buy it for you in Japan

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I don't really think the HuCard is that

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
expensive at all I will tell you

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
one thing if you're trying to play a HuCard on

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
an American system none of the

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
converters really work even if you've got that

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
purple one it's freaking expensive

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
and it works half the time so don't even bother

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
with it just get a PC Engine

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
the end

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
alright well we're going to take

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
a break here and come back with more of Orange Lounge

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Radio there's still plenty we have yet to discuss

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
this week we haven't even gotten to some of the Playstation news

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
that came out of E3 we're going to talk about a little bit

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
of what is this cross eye

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
she XE

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
we're going to try and make some sense out of this

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
and what it's all about right after

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
a quick break so we'll be back in just a few minutes with

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
more of Orange Lounge Radio unless you're on the podcast

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
it's only a few seconds so

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
we'll be right back

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Music

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Music

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Music

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Sunday evening March the 29th of 2009

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
where we're taping live

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
on All Games Radio www.allgames.com

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
bringing you

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
more of the latest and greatest in video

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
we also do a little

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
simulcast on

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Justin TV where tonight

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
you're not looking at our ugly mugs doing the show

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
we thought maybe there'd be something a little more exciting

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
if we have a video well A I actually

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
lost the camera but I think this is actually working out

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
where Loki's actually playing a game during the show and

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
tonight he's playing Grand Theft Auto 4 but he's playing a special

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
version that he

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
hacked the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
and it has super uber physics in it

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
yeah it has if you're

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
a fan of the PC version it has the

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Super Comet which I added those

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
physics to the bus and to the ambulance

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
and then I modified

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
the

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Mac I think it's the

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Mac 11 in there to have a

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
pretty fast

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
fire rate and

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
almost a thousand rounds

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
in a clip and then

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
my punching has

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
a physics force of

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
60,000 so I can punch cars

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
into space basically

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
so

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
so you're gonna continue

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
to kind of play that throughout the show

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
but you gotta start you gotta pause it and do some news

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
cause we wanna talk about some Sony news

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
here real quick yes

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
so there's this alternate

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
reality game that's going on in

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
home right now thanks

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
to Sony the game

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
is called well it's

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
xi or she or

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
as I'm calling it cross eyed

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
I don't know the symbol itself doesn't look like xi

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
so I don't know where they're getting that from it kind of

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
looks like an hourglass or something

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
but whatever

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
but anyways they have a

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
trailer that was released I guess and

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
I haven't really gotten a chance to

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
do any of this

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
but apparently they have like a weekly

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
recap and there's some sort of

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
like clues you need to find and

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
kind of a ticker and stuff so

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
um

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
so you said it's the Greek symbol?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
it's the Greek symbol so it's xi

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Greek symbol really?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
yes

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
what if this has to do with anything that's probably gonna tie in

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
with an announcement for God of War 3

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
or at least a release date or something like that

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I wonder I wonder I wonder

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
ooh you're smart

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
but really no

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
and it's the summer right now

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
so July

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
anyways so I don't know what exactly

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
this is gonna be unveiling

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I'm sure it's gonna

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
waste enough time to

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
E3 and maybe it'll make some sort of announcement

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
that ties in with everything

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
but hey who doesn't like a good

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
ARG I mean you know

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I heart bees or I love bees or something like that

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
yeah

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
so cool if you want to check it out just

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
go in the home

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I should sue for copyright because that's how people mispronounce

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
my name all the time is xi

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
it's xi

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
like KSI

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
xer xi

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
no I just no I think low key

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
at the nail on the head though if it's for anything

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
it is probably some type of underground

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
campaign for God of War 3

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
yeah sounds like

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
but it's interesting though don't you think it's interesting that they're actually kind of

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
doing new shit with home?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
I mean that's what's kind of nice about it

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
it's nice that they're actually doing shit with home

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
although they still don't have like

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
what the trophy rooms and stuff that they had promised

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
in the beginning I mean whatever happened to that

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
maybe someday I don't know

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
or better functionality with the groups

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
that whole thing

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
yeah who knows

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
alright well anyhow let's talk about some other news at a Game Developers Conference

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
you know we talked about OnLive

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
which is a new console of sorts

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
not really a console but this is a console

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
now there's something else here

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Tektoy is putting out a new console

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
the Zeebo

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
and it's going to do just downloadable games

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
which might make you think about the Phantom and all that stuff

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I don't know

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
but the Zeebo here's the catch

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
it's coming out in Brazil this July

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
so it's not something that's necessarily being targeted here

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
at markets over here in North America

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
it's coming out first in Brazil

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
and then I guess some other markets maybe in South America

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
or other places

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
what's interesting

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Quake, Evil Prey and Action Hero 3D

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
are some of the titles that are supposed to be already on the console

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
by the time you get it

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
it's not something that's supposed to compete with the Wii

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
the 360 or the Playstation 3

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
apparently what this console is going to do

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
it actually connects to a large 3G network

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
through a big cellular provider

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
and apparently

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
it's not necessarily about being the most powerful system out there

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
but it's supposed to be about

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
getting stuff through download channels

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
to help combat

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
piracy that goes on

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
but this is interesting

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
EA Mobile, Capcom, Namco Networks

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
PopCap Games, THQ, they're all on board

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
and it's going to cost about

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
$7 to $13

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
per game

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I converted to American dollars there for you

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
the console itself, $264 American

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
though

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
the question though, I mean

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I'm not really familiar with mobile games too much

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
is there really that much piracy of mobile games?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
I mean

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I would think that they're not losing that much money on that stuff

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
that's just my thought

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
YYR in chat

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
has a funny thought about the trophy room

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
that you'll have to buy the trophy room for 99 cents

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
and then you'll have to buy the bookshelf

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
and the trophy room for 49 cents each

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
because they can each only hold 3 trophies

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I thought he was being serious at first

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
but no, I don't think that's real

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
anyhow, so yeah

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
there is a new console coming out just not in the part of the world

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
where most of you are from

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
but I do know we have some international listeners

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
so maybe this is something some of our international listeners

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
might get their hands on

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and see if it's worth it or not

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
although probably the folks listening to this program

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
are already importing the more expensive stuff

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
$260 whatever dollars

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
American, I think $599 brazilian

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
for that system

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
is a bargain compared to what you would pay

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
for a lot of the consoles imported down there

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
so something to think about

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
yeah

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
well, there's actually

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
some news on the more

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
conventional system

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I guess front

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
there is a

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Katamari Damacy

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
tribute coming to

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Playstation 3

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
the original one

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
is

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
well, the

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
original version I guess is supposed to be in

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Katamari Damacy tribute

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
where it will be presented in

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
1080p

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
and have a new visual presentation

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
that's a quote

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
it's going to have

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
remixes

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
from the previous titles

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
as far as the music is concerned

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
and it's

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I'm guessing it's a big

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Katamari mashup

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
yeah, I think it's a bunch of the levels from the other games

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
wish there was some new stuff

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
it's still going to be fun

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
oh yeah

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I'll have to pick it up

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
weird six axis stuff

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
no, they got rid of the six axis

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
no, I'm actually kind of surprised

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
that they're doing it as a download title too

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
because you would think something like that would definitely be able to sell at retail

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
six axis is still there

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
flower is run completely on six axis

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
it's actually fairly effective

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
I hate the six axis though

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
for some games it's okay

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
like flower, I think is a great game

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
it's not something you're going to invest a lot of time in

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
but for what it is, it's great

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
sorry bogey

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
so, I mean that would be pretty cool

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I mean

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I just don't understand

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I would think they'd make more money at retail

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
if they brought it out

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
but maybe they just want less

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
you know

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
packaging or something, I don't know

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
whatever

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
something else that's coming the way of the PS3

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
and we were talking about home a little bit earlier

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
they're going to get some new spaces actually

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
including

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
a Guitar Hero themed space

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
called backstage with Guitar Hero

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
and of course

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
they're going to have

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
you know, all the House of Blues

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
kind of stuff, I guess one of the levels from the game

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
there's also a VIP space

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
in the back, which is sealed off

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
by a velvet rope

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I'm not sure who they're going to have back there

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
and

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
you know, other than that

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
there's going to be

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I guess maybe a

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
mini game or something like that

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Rock God, which is kind of like Simon

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
like matching the cord type thing

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
and then some other

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
possible games may be in there

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I don't know about you

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
but I think most of these spaces

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
that they have in home are kind of useless

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
you go there once and you're like, oh that's kind of neat

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
and that's about it

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
at least you went there

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
it's a free commercial for the game, right?

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
yeah, but I mean it's not anything real cool

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
like you can't say play

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
the PlayStation 3 version or something like that

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
and your characters appear on stage

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
performing the song

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
or anything like that

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
wasn't there this whole thing though that you were going to be able to launch

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
PlayStation games from within home

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
well I guess you still can kind of do that

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
but I don't know, you just don't see a lot of people actually doing that

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
compared to, I don't know, Xbox 360

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
just kind of seems to make it all easy

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
it's just like home is like a big

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
non-necessity I guess

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I mean it's cool

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
it has a lot of potential

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
but they're not really using it

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
yeah

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I don't know, but again anything they do

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
is going to be better than the ASL stuff that's going on right now

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
you know what I mean?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
any cute girls want to chat, that's pretty much all you ever see

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
in a home, so any of this extra kind of stuff

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
might be kind of neat, I don't know

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
it would be nice if they would have like different types of spaces

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
within home, like you could go to

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
one server for social chat

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
one server for like gamer chat

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
but then again we all know nobody would stay in the zone

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
they're supposed to, so why am I bothering?

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
well PlayStation Home is just going to keep growing

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
you guys, you know there's not only, there's the Red Bull

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
area, there's the Resident Evil 5 area

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Warhawk, now Guitar Hero, guess what

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
apparently according to Jack Bueser

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
who is the director of PlayStation Home

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
if you think about a game developers conference this week

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
you will see about quote, three new spaces

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
launched a month

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
that does make sense

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
though when you consider there's like over 20 companies

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
that are signed up right now that are supposedly going to be

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
making new content for Home

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
so there you go, apparently Home actually has

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
5 million users already worldwide

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
about half of those being in North America

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
so they say

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
that a good space gets

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
about 250,000 visits

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
every week, and 75%

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
of the users will spend more than

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
10 minutes on the space, and like I said

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
before, you know, despite the quality

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
the fact is, you go into these spaces

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
and it's like a giant advertisement for the game

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
which you might be more likely to buy

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
is that 10 minutes part of the downloading the space

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
or the waiting for the lag, you know

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
might not take that long, watching the

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
loops of Twilight over and over

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
yeah

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
um, yeah

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I don't know, well they show

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
new movies on there now, don't they?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I saw Mall Cop in there for like 2 weeks

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
something

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
alright, well anyhow

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
well, you know what's better than everything in the universe?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
uh, cake

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
zombies!

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
zombies with cake?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
ooh, that would be fantastic

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
zombie cake party?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I love loathing zombies

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
um, there is a newcomer

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
to the Playstation store

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
that's called Burn Zombie Burn

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
um, that's gonna be

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
on PS3, there's also

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
to go along with that, um

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
is downloadable content for LittleBigPlanet

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Pain, Resistance 2

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Endwar, Call of Duty 5

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
and a PS1 copy of Magic Carpet

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
oh my god

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I remember that game

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
well, Burn Zombie Burn

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
is by Double Six

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
it's going for

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
£6.29

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
in Euros at

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
£7.99

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
um, you have to

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
just hold off zombies

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
for as long as you can

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and the longer you hold them out

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
the higher score you get

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
where have I heard of this before? Left 4 Dead?

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
the longer you hold off the zombies

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
the more content you unlock

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
based on your score

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
um, for Resistance 2 there's the Aftermath

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Map Pack

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
and um, Call of Duty

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
World at War will get Map Pack 1

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
and um

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
they actually

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
have to pay more than we did on

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Xbox, but I think it's supposed to be

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
much more touched up

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
um, there's the Pain Smack Pack

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
the El Chilli Grande

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
um, character

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
um, I guess for that

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
LittleBigPlanet is getting a Buzz

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
costume

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Endwar and Unreal Tournament 3

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
get the Veteran Map Pack

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
and Titan Pack respectively

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
those are free

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
that's kind of neat that they have

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
some Resistance stuff

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I just have to actually play through that still

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
well another thing for the PSP is

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Buzz Brain of the UK

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
hmm

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
so

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
but that's for UK only

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I think

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
well something we're getting over here

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
at least on the Xbox 360

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I think it's in

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
where the regions have the

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Xbox community games

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
and you knew that at some point

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
somebody was going to do something like this

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
well now there's a

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
um, a sex-rated

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
uh, Xbox

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
community game, sex-rated I guess

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
because it's slightly censored but it's still

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
kind of got the naughty stuff in there

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
it's a game

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
called Break One Out

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
and it's basically a Breakout clone

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
or um

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
but what's unique about it though

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
is there's this chick

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Kitty who looks like a cosplayer

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
and there's revealing

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
photos of her

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
except, you know, where all the naughty bits are covered with black bars

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
but she is naked in the pictures

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
so basically you

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
play the game and you unlock naked

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
pictures of this one chick who

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I don't know, she's alright

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
she's not hot

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
but you know

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
as hot as I guess a cosplayer

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
at your average anime convention

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
could be

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I guess somebody made this game

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
just for the sake of making the first

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
controversial titty

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
filled community game, correct?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Probably

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
so

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
but, you know, hey

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
that's uh, it's out there

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
and I think it's cheap, I'm not sure if it's like

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
two bucks or something but

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
you know, it doesn't look very good

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
but hey, if you want to see the naked pictures of her

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I mean, or

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
as naked as she's going to get

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
don't play the game, you can actually watch the video

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I have a video online for it

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
but uh

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I don't know, it's just like

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
if you want to knock some balls around while you look at the picture

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
you know, you can play the game

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
or you can watch the video and knock

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
some balls around

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
anyhow

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
YYR is saying that it was

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
only up for a day or less, do you think this thing was already

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
taken down? I wouldn't be surprised

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
it's alright, it was crap

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I kind of wish I had downloaded it

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
just to have it, but

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
oh well

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Microsoft

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
is in a little bit of hot water this week over something

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
you've probably seen floating around the game

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
blogs this week, and this has to do with

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Lionhead Studios, who is of course

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
a subsidiary of Microsoft, they're the folks

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
behind Fable

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
and here's the interesting

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
part of this story

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
it has to do with a gay video game designer

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
and his name is Jamie Durant

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
he's going to be suing Microsoft for

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
45,000 pounds

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
due to hurt feelings, lost pay

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
discrimination, all due to his sexual

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
orientation, and this apparently

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
happened after Microsoft bought Lionhead

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
he's worked for this company for 11 years

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
apparently, and he says

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
things began to get a little bit uneasy around there

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
and starting around January

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
of the last year, he started getting abusive

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
emails, with subjects reading like

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
me and my favorite men

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
I'm Jim and I'm gay, and he was

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
given the nickname, Fag Boy Jim

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
he's

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
apparently complained to the human resources department

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
but nothing happened except

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
a promise and a memo that was

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
supposed to go around to the company about

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
diversity in the workplace and all these types

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
of things that companies usually do when they're

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
panicked that a lawsuit might happen

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
and that the firm was supposed to update the policies

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
none of this ever happened according to the lawsuit

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
and Durant also claims

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
that he was the one who was offered counseling

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
which he said to that, they're making

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
out that I'm the one with the problem

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
apparently he has been out of work

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
suffering from depression for seven months

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
and he's now seeking damages due to this

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
but

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I don't know, here's the weird

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
thing, and the thing that's kind of weird about

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
this is that Microsoft has kind of

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
gotten praise from the

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
human rights campaign foundation for

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
the way they treat their gay and lesbian

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
and bisexual workers before, so

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
is this a problem with

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
one particular office?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Is this a problem with

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Lionhead? Is this a problem

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
with the employee?

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
There's two sides to every story, right?

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Is there something else going on here?

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I don't know, it's

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
hard to say, we're only kind of hearing one side

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
of it. They'd have to do a really

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
thorough investigation to get any kind of

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
actual

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
point out of that.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
The part of it that's interesting is the part

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
that he's already been out of work for seven months

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
and if it's due to this

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
it's gotta be really bad. It's gotta be

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
really, really bad. But

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I mean, and again, I don't know this guy,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I'm not gonna slander this guy, I don't know anything that's

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
going on here, but before, you know, and I think

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
a lot of people might read this and go, oh Rob's

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
gonna be pissed on the show because he's gay too,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
he's gonna throw a fit over this. Not necessarily

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
because I also know

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
people that sometimes

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
like to be the victim. Oh yeah.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
You know what I mean? And when I hear this

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
whole fact about he's been out of work for a long time

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I start to go, you know, there could be

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
another side to this coin. I don't know.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I don't know the facts. I'm not him.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
But I do know that there could be more

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
to this than meets the eye.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I would just hope to hell. Maybe

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I'm just hopeful and maybe foolishly

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
so. I just, I'm hopeful to hell

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
that in this fucking year 2009

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
we would just get past

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
this stupid school

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
playground bullshit.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I know. Sadly we haven't.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Not completely. Maybe I'm just

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
spoiled because I happen to work in a place

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
where this shit doesn't happen.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
And I'm fairly confident

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
and almost 100% confident this kind of shit

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
would not happen.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
So when I read these stories I'm just like

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
really? Really?

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Fagboy? In an email?

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Really? Someone's that dumb

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
to do something like that that can be

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
traced? Really?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
I don't get it.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
And Goldanthro in chat

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
says not pissed, eh Rob?

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I don't know. Like if this story is true

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
fuck yeah I'm pissed. This is

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
inexcusable. This is stupid.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
But

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
you know there's two sides to every story.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Just because the guy filed the lawsuit

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
doesn't necessarily mean it's 100%

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
true. I think that's one thing we have to remember.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Right? So I don't want to lose my shit

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
and start saying oh we should boycott

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Lionhead and we should boycott all these games.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I don't know. Now if

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
it comes out through due process

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
and in the court of law that yeah

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Lionhead did do something wrong

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
then I will lose my shit and prepare to say

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
some choice things about the company.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
But at this stage it's a little early to tell, correct?

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I agree.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Regardless, very disappointing

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
that this lawsuit is filed one way or

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
the other. So

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
of course you knew after a story like

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:34.000
this could only come a segment of ours we love.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Really my F.U. of the week

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
is just

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
people who

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
don't want to look at the facts

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
and want to use their own version.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
It really, okay.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Only a few people will really get

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
the root of this but it goes towards

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
something that I

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
have noticed that applies to politics,

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
religion, and fandom.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Don't

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
twist things

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
into your version

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
of what they should be just to justify

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
what you, you know, believe.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
At least admit fact.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
If it's what you believe

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
then that's what you believe but at least

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
accept reality.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
That's all.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
And also to

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
being super exhausted

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
all day yesterday and being sick from it.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Then.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I personally

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
do not really have many F.U.s of the week.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Things have been going fine so I'll keep an F.U. to my incessant

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
napping habit. I nap a lot

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
and it's like screwing up my sleep schedule

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
royally. So I need to stop

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
that. An F.U. to lack of motivation

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
into my exercise program as well.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I need to get back on that.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Um, F.U. to allergies because my nose

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
has been all stuffed up the last few days.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
It's all windy over here.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
That's it.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Alright.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
That's gonna do it for the F.U.s of the week.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Let's get back to some gaming news.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Dark Sakura, speaking of Lionhead

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Studios.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Well.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
am happy because I am

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
still sort of playing this game when I can.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
But there is actually supposed

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
to be new downloadable content

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
available for Fable 2.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
And that is exciting.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
They're still paying attention to us.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
People who are still playing it.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
It's supposed to be

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
coming out in

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
the spring. So I'm supposing early

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
spring.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
But there's

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
nothing, I think not a whole

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
lot that I'm seeing about what exactly

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
it is. They're just revealing

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
they're going to be revealing information

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
on it.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
But they say that it's supposed

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
to answer questions if you've been

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
a fan of the whole series.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
And apparently

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
it's supposed to be really dramatic. So I don't

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
know.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
But there actually

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
though has been a statement by

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Jonathan Ross

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
that he was offered a voice role

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
in Fable 3.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
So maybe there's

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
a connection there?

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Maybe there's something leading up into the next

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
game.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Great. Fable 3.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Well I don't think that's going to be any surprise.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
It would be exactly the same as Fable 1 and 2.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Well 2 had a lot of differences

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
from 1 I thought. I thought they were very different.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Jonathan Ross

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
is pretty cool.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I don't know.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
That's what I say about

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
that.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Well something not Fable

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
related. But kind of cool.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I mean this is one of the first games I've played

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
on my old

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
386 computer. This was the first

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
first person shooter

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
game I've seen.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Was it

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Wolfenstein 3D

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
being released on

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
the iPhone?

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
How cool is that?

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
And

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
possibly

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
soon enough, Doom will be

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
released as well.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
But hey, Wolfenstein 3D

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
man, that takes me back. One of the first games I

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
actually edited levels for using their

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I don't know if they released the level editor

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
or if it was one someone else made.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
But pretty awesome.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
And you can actually play it now on the iPhone.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
And

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
damn I can imagine that would probably run

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
pretty well since the game is ancient.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
But

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
pretty cool.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
You can speculate what they're saying in German.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Yeah.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
And I guess it's free.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I'm not sure if this is like a free version of the game

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
or if they're going to do like a

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
you know

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Oh it is free. I guess it's actually

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
part of an open source project.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
So check it out. Free.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Hey, that's the best price ever.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
For free.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Well

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
there's other games coming to the iPhone that aren't

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
free but they're very very nostalgic

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
nonetheless. Mega Man 2

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
is out right

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
now. It's not coming soon. It's already out

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
on the iTunes app store.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
It's interesting though the way it controls

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
because since the iPhone doesn't really have any

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
controls on it which you would think

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
they're going to release something eventually.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
They can just plug into the bottom of the iPhone and

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
voila instant gamepad. I don't know.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
But right now you use a little joystick

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
that's on the bottom that is like kind of

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
a touch and then two buttons. So it's like a virtual

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
joystick using the touch screen.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
But yeah it's Mega Man 2.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
But I would think

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
it's going to be difficult to control because of the

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
fact it's kind of those weird buttons and touch

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
but hey there's going to be some nostalgic

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
freaking people that are very excited about this game anyway.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Do you think you could still

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
beat the first boss in Wily's Castle without looking

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Dark Soccer on the iPhone? Oh heck no.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I can't even do it anymore on the Nintendo.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Seriously I'm

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
so out of practice on that game.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Yeah that would be tough.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Plus I'd be worried I'd get a phone call in the middle of it

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
and then the whole thing is just screwed up.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
You know right as I'm starting to jump over a pit or something.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Seriously? Then besides that

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I can just break out my Nintendo.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
TigerKlonChat wants to point out

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Loki, those games you were talking about before are

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
$4.99 in the App Store, not free. Maybe there's a free

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
version or something. Well yeah that's what I was

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
wondering. I was like free? But it said it was part of an

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
open source project and it said it was released for free

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
but I had my doubts.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Especially with Wolfenstein 3D. It wouldn't give

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
us something like that away for free.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
And of course our chatters are already talking about

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
the Mega Man 2 thing

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
on the iPhone and X-Link says

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
do not buy Mega Man 2 it is hard to control.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
AcidicVampire says IGN gave

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
the iPhone Mega Man 2 a 1 out of 10

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
and it's really awful to control. Not that I would

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
believe everything that IGN says but in this

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
case I would probably believe it.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
The game probably does stink. I can totally see how it would be hard to

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
control. Especially given

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
the way that it's set up.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Is there a lefty mode in it?

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I saw the joystick thing.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I don't know. That's a good question.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
No.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
It wouldn't work.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Yeah I don't think

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
that game is going to be any fun to play on the iPhone

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
at all but hey if you're that nostalgic and you

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
need it in your pocket everywhere you go

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
go for it.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Or just get like a Game Boy

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
or something I don't know.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Emulate the bitch on the PSP.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Actually I'll tell you what Dan and I did

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
whenever we won our Mega Man 2 fix.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
We actually ordered a handheld

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Nintendo.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
That they make.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
And they're like 70 bucks.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
But we ordered one a while back. I'm waiting for it to arrive.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
They're supposed to be

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
pretty cool.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Well how about something that's a little bit

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
happier. How about

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
some Guitar Hero

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
World Tour information.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Actually very specifically how about

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Queen

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
on Guitar Hero World Tour.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
There's actually

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
going to be a song pack that has

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
celebrity fat bottom girls

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
and we are the champions for

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
440 points

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
for the pack

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
or you can buy each one for

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
160.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
And they're going to be 549 on

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
PlayStation Network.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
You actually will be able

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
to get them on Wii as well

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
for 200 Wii points.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
And then there's

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
supposed to be a

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
new recording of the James Bond theme

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
that's supposed to be available

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
coming up soon.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I saw

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
something on YouTube. I don't know if it was that

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
exact one. I thought it was one that someone made

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
how you can make your custom tracks

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
or whatever.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
And it was pretty awesome.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
So hopefully it's the same one.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
That was a pretty awesome version of the Bond theme.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Lots of liberties taken

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
and it looked pretty hard.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Not

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
quite as kick ass on

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
the rock band.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
We get some interesting

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
things. Including

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Spongebob Squarepants music.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Who'd have thought we'd see that

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
in a rock band.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
But apparently we are.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
The Spongebob Squarepants pack

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
is actually going to be

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
relatively cheap. It's going to be

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
99 cents per song or 80

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Microsoft points.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Those include

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I Can't Keep My Eyes Off You, Best

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Day Ever, and Where's Gary.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
And then other than that

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Journey is going to be

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
getting a song on there with Don't Stop Believin'.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
And

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I guess also joining

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
that would be Pat Benatar's Heartbreaker.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
And that's

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
coming as well.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
And then some other stuff.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Glass Vegas with

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Geraldine and Come On Come On by

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Von Bondis.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Not Bondis.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And that's pretty

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
much it for this week though.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Spongebob, that's weird.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Yeah, but Journey. Freakin' Journey's coming

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
out. So who cares? That's amazing.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
They could have put a better song in there though.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
You know what, I actually agree. I think Don't Stop Believin'

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
is way too cliche. And especially for a rock band.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
You should have put it by

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Wheel in the Sky. Yeah, Wheel in the Sky

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
would be awesome. But you know,

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
whatever. I'll take what I can get. I mean,

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
who isn't going to want to bust out with Don't Stop

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Believin' at a party, right? I just see that one as being way too easy

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
even on Expert. Yeah, probably.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Who knows. Anyhow,

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
this is the part of the show where we like to open up the old

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
mailbag and read some of your emails

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
that you send to us every week at Mailbag at

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com. So let's get into it.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
First email comes from J-Rod.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Hey OLR crew, I'm emailing

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
to try to get your stance on this guitar hero versus

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
rock band war people are in.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I still don't see any differences between rock bands

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
that download content and a guitar hero disc.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
It's both companies

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
putting out new content to the player.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I don't even own guitar hero

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
but I at least think it's a good idea to let

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
people without an internet connection actually be able

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
to play new songs. Look at rock band

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
on the Wii. Would you seriously

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
be happy owning that when

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
you see what's on the other platforms?

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Then people complain, well,

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I only want three of the songs. I don't want to pay

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
$50 for the whole game.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
But then don't complain at all when they have to

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
buy a new Wii track pack plus

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
um, I'm sorry

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Wii track pack for

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
a few songs just because

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
it's the rock band title.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
People say Activision is running

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
the series into the ground but putting out

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
more content but isn't rock band doing the

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
same thing just not with a physical

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
disc? I don't see

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
how a disc makes any amount of difference

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
in the equation when it's still

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
more songs and more content coming

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
out by both companies. Again

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
nobody made such a fuss

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
with the ACDC pack or with the Wii track

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
packs the way they do with Activision.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Um, the only one I would

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
say is the ACDC pack because that wasn't

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
available online but all the rock band

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
track packs are just for people that don't have

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
internet connections and some random

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
stuff that's available for download content.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
You do not need to buy it. It's not

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
its own, you know, I mean it can be its own

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
game which is fine but

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
it's not basically

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
you know, it's not required. It's not like

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
a Guitar Hero Metallica or something like that

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
where you're only going to be able to get those tracks

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
through that disc version. So I don't

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
really see the harm in releasing that because it

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
gives people an option that don't have the

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
internet connection to be able to

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
actually download some of these tracks.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
And it's completely optional. Now the ACDC thing

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
yeah that's no excuse. That

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
you did have to get through that and that was

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
also an exclusive through Walmart so

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
And it was one band.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
And frankly a band I'm

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
not interested in. Shock and awe I know

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
they're a great rock band but just not my

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
type of thing. But look at like

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I was

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
going to say look at the stuff that they're doing

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
though with Guitar Hero right

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
now. They've got like Guitar Hero Metallica

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
they've got Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
greatest hits. All stuff

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
that's not necessarily available on

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
their service and granted greatest hits are

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
some of the older songs that were in the older games

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
but I mean they could easily

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
release that as you know download content

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
for world tour. They don't need to have

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
it's own game and really it's not

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
adding anything it's just a reskinned world tour

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
just you know

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
now with whatever band

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
and I think it's kind of lame

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
that they don't even have like a track import

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
function that they do with like rock band.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I do know of people

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
who actually

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
do not use live at

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
all who

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
don't you know bother

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
with it who don't play online

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
so for them Guitar Hero actually is a better

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
option really.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
But to finish out the email

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
cause he actually did go on with a little

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
bit more. In the end if you

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
ask me it all comes down to people crying about

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
switching discs. Are you kidding me

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
I own both rock band games and don't have

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
rock band 2 imported because it takes me

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
6 seconds to switch a disc.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I play a few songs I want on one game

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
then play a few songs I want on another game

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
and some download content. If you have friends

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
over in the whole place just shuts down

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
because you have to switch a disc

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
tell them to take their ADHD medication

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
before they come over next time. And that's the thing

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
with rock band you can import that stuff so you don't have

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
to switch discs it's all

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
you know you can dump it to your hard drive. He completely has the point of what he just

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
said. Well

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
the whole I don't know. The whole point of what he just

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
said is that it takes 6 seconds to change a disc.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Yeah well and here's the thing

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
it's all optional no one's forcing you

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
to buy Guitar Hero or

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Rock Band so if you want it you want

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
it cool if you don't want it then don't buy

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
it. But don't feel that you're forced to actually

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
buy this stuff cause you know

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
as soon as you start buying every single release

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
it comes out just because you want to

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
be able to you know have

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
you want to support them so that they release

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
you know whatever band you're waiting for or whatever

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I think that's a horrible reason to do it.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Well to finish the

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
email cause there's still a little bit more on this

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
what happens when the Beatles game comes out

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
because I'm sure you won't be able to import that into your

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
library. Are people going to be bitching about that?

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
That's all.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Honestly I think it comes

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
down to personal preference. I think Rock Band

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
plays better than Guitar Hero

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
in fact I think Rock Band plays

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
a hell of a lot better than Guitar Hero

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
it just seems generally programmed

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
to be more responsive so I have a better time

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
playing that. And in defense

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
of importing your Rock Band

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
One tracks it actually if you

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
want to mix and match

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
bands from both modes especially

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
when you can create your own setlist

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
it actually

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
it gives you more freedom to

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
combine it the way that you want to.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
But hey whatever sinks

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
your battleship. Well the thing

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
also with the importing on the Beatles

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
version I think that was a special deal

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
that they had with I don't know who owns it

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I think it's Apple or something

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Apple Music that you know they didn't

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
want it to be imported into Rock Band

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
and it's not technically a Rock Band game

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
it's just kind of like Rock Band presents

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
the Beatles it's their own game

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
it's their own kind of thing going on there

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
so that's

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
going to be kind of like an exception but if

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
no ever comes out there's a

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Rock Band Metallica

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
or something like that then yeah

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I'm pretty sure that we'll have

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
import

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
functionality and that kind of stuff and then

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
honestly I don't see them actually doing that I would see

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
them releasing it as like an album you can

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
download because I think that they

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
would get a lot more hits because a lot of people

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
well I don't like this song

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I'm not going to buy Guitar

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Hero greatest hits because it only has a couple

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
songs that I want on it well if you

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
could download those songs individually at least you sold

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
those two songs you know whereas someone

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
might just avoid the package altogether if they can't

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
separate them it's all about

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
choice as Microsoft would say

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
well

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
the next email is actually

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
a short one and I think this is addressed to Rob really

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
because I don't think either of us were really boycotting

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
and he pretty much already

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
answered it but I'm going to read it anyway that's fine

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
now that the boycott is over what

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
are you most anxious to try out if you haven't

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
already discussed it

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Bit.Trip Beat was one I was really looking forward to

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
I also want to go back and check out

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
probably one of the Commodore 64 downloads

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
just because I want to see how well those came over

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
I'm still kind of holding out for Impossible

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Mission I would like to be the one I would get

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
but I'm not opposed to going back and getting one of the other

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Commodore 64 greats like Last Ninja

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
or Pitstop 2 even just because

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
I have memories with that one

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
as far as the WiiWare games I feel so far behind

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
on a lot of those I don't even really know where to begin

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
but

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
I know Bit.Trip Beat was one I was definitely looking

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
forward to personally as well as the Gradius

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Rebirth which were the two I picked up right away

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
after my boycott was over

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
that's really it I might go

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
back and

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
thinking about maybe getting some obscure Neo Geo

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
games but I don't know I don't want to go too crazy with the

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
money spending either it's very

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
easy when you're not actually

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
giving away tangible

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
cash but you're hitting a button that

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
drains it out of your bank account you know what I mean

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
that's something you got to keep yourself in check with sometimes

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I used to buy

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
like every single Xbox Live Arcade game that came

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
out and I really had to stop doing that because

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
some of them were crap

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
but yeah I got to watch

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
out with going too crazy

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
on the Wii but I'll buy good stuff as it comes out

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
as I notice it

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
there was another music game

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
that had come out that I want to go back and check out

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
that I missed and

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I don't remember the name of it maybe somebody in chat

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
will speak up but I distinctly remember there was some other

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
type of beat game that had come out

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
previously on WiiWare that I wanted to check out

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Last email

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
This is from Spazinator

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Hi everyone

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
at OLR I have a few questions for you three

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
to mull over I'll try to keep

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
this email as short as possible seeing as most of the ones

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
I've sent were a bit on the long side

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
one regarding PSN's

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
high velocity bowling PS3's version of

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Wii bowling have you folks noticed

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
any problems with the game? Gameplay

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
in and of itself

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
seems fine to me but I can see

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
how a lot of people may have a problem

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
with the game specifically the characters within the game

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
so the characters are basically stereotypes

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
ranging from Latinos to

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
70's Black Panther-esque

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
characters and even

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
a gay flight attendant

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
if it weren't for the stereotypes this would be a great game

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
but as I'm actually

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
embarrassed to say that

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
as is I'm actually

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
embarrassed to say that I have this

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
I don't even remotely resemble any of the stereotypes

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
yet I find myself offended for the people

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
that the stereotyping characters are

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
supposed to poke fun of what is your position

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
on this am I just overreacting

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
or is there some cause for

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
concern?

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I have a quote I'd like to say

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
about this

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
don't be offended for other people

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
please I'm

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
going to quote one of my favorite comedians

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Henry Cho for

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
using the term

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
oriental to refer to himself

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
and someone says oh no it's Asian American

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
he says well excuse me for offending myself

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
don't be offended

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
for other people if they're going to be offended

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
let them be offended you don't worry about it

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
if you're not doing the offense

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
then don't freaking worry about it that's what I have to say

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
you know you're

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
you didn't make the game

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
you bought it and you didn't know

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
that it was in there you know

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
just

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
roll with the punches fucking deal with it

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
it's there it's you know

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I personally I crack

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
up as hell at redneck

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
stereotypes seriously and I

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
can say that's all my family

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
you know I know that not everyone from Alabama

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
is stupid and inbred but

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
I still laugh at Larry the cable guy

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
cause that's a parody

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
you know I

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
I don't see what the big deal is his name isn't

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Larry and he's not really a cable guy exactly

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
it's parody

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
perpetuating a stereotype for satire

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
uh

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I haven't played the game I don't really

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
want to make a comment on something I haven't really seen

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
first hand but it doesn't sound like it's

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
as long as it's there's a line

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
there's a real fine line a real

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
fine line between poking fun

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
and maliciously

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
you know hurting

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
people and I doubt this game is trying to maliciously

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
hurt people if that makes sense

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
um but I don't know I'd have

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
to see it it's a bully title how

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
could it be malicious unless

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
it's just over the top

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
with you know

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
if the characters just look that way

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
and may have a little bit of dialogue that's just

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
that's just supposed to be fun

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
you know

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
people need to really I think

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
just toughen up and get the hell over it

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
and you I

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
this is my opinion again I'm not telling you what to believe

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
but I don't think

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
that one person has the right

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
to be offended on behalf

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
of another person especially

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
if there's a chance that they're not offended

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
that's just

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
me

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
I doubt I would be offended

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
by the little gay flight attendant or whatever

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
in this game this is like every single

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
game has those kind of stereotype

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
characters because people can identify

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
with stereotype characters you know

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
um they're in

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
movies I mean

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
how many stereotype movies are

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
out there I mean of just like

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
all sorts of stuff it's

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
just it's part of everyday life

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
in the media unfortunately even in Austin

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Powers we had Foxy Cleopatra

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
and that was just a nod back to the

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
70s movies you know like

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
the what's her name Pam Greer

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
you know

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Bobby in chat says I'm offended on dark

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
soccer's behalf about offended people

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
they can

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
bite my ass

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
chew on that for a bit

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
seriously

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
68 makes an interesting comment I don't know how far we want

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
to go with this but I'm going to open

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
a whole can of worms here we go

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
68 says by that same token

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
everyone who isn't not

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
straight shouldn't have voted no

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
on prop 8

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
or should I don't know he used bad

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
grammar here should have that's

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
not a matter of being offended

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
that's a matter of a human rights issue that's

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
different your

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
that's apples and oranges right there

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
it's a matter of

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
taking something personally

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
that doesn't apply to you

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I mean if we were really you know

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
this is something

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
that was supposed to supposedly

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
affect the entire

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
population of California

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
you've got

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
it would basically create new

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
taxation it would change

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
economic status

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
it was a very big

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
thing it's a big human rights issue

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
there's a difference though between

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
like I know people

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
who

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
may not particularly agree

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
you know with the lifestyle

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
who voted no on prop 8

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
just because it was

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
a matter of human rights

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
I don't know how far I want to go with this but I can just

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
say you know it's like

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
you know obviously the issue was very important to me and the

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
result was very very very very very disappointing and

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
I even had some people tell me that you know

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
they voted yes on it like

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
I don't know they felt the need to confess they

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
they voted yes on it because

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
church or god told them to

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
and it's so it's so frustrating because

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
it's like think for yourself

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
how would you like it if it was you

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
it's not a choice alright

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
god anyway sorry

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
I could go on all day about it

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
different show whole nother Oprah

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
I will go ahead and plug my blog

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
if anyone wants to know my

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
opinion on this I posted the

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
blog on darksacroix.com

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
and please don't

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
spam it I don't care

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
um so how about there's the email

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
yes please okay

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
currently I have a relatively cheap

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Sony Bravia surround system

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
which I got from Target last year

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
for the most part it serves its purpose and sounds

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
good but there is one problem I've noticed

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
unless I'm playing a DVD

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
it's um and it's built

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
in DVD player I won't get surround sound

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
as is in terms of input

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
the system has typical red white RCA

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
jacks um mini plug input

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
like what you'd see on headphones

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
some kind of jack I'm unfamiliar with

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
all I know is that it's the one

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
iPods use for outputs

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I guess um in essence

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
is there a way to trick my surround

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
system to accept stuff

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
like my PS3 or

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
360 surround which supports

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
sound output and actually hear it in my surround

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
sound and basically in my SOL

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
any info on this will help a lot

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
thanks um my recommendation

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
is um

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
to uh go on eBay and look

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
for a hardened Karman receiver and just

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
use your speakers and use that

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
it sounds like your receiver doesn't actually

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
have surround sound maybe Prologic

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
um which would be why you

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
don't have any actual digital or analog

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
um you know

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
surround sound inputs

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
usually you would have an optical in

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
um which you might see on the back of your

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
PS3 or your Xbox

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
360 on like the component cable and stuff like that

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
or um

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
sometimes a coax as

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
well which would be kind of like your RCA

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
plugs but they're orange

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
so um

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I don't know

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
if you don't have either one of those you're probably not gonna

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
really get true surround sound unless they

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
have some sort of surround sound mode in it and

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
it's gonna have to be Prologic which you're just

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
gonna hook up through your um standard

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
RCA red and white my initial thought

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
with this was anytime you

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
use a converter you're gonna lose some sound quality

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
right you know so

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
isn't that part of the problem too

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
no it's just that he doesn't have an actual way

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
to send the 51 signal

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
over to his um system

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
it's like my old

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
tech support now suddenly look out

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
twit it's like I had a was it

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I had an old system

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
that looked like it was you know 51

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
it had the surround sound speakers it had a center

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
channel and you know the left

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
and right and the two rears and stuff

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
um but it was not surround sound it was just

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Prologic because there was no actual

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
surround it did no surround

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
sound processing uh tip from

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Tigerclaw here in chat the surround receiver

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
must have optical inputs to plug the PS3

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
or 360 into it my receiver

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
has one optical input and I have the 360

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
connect to it and it's outputting 5.1 surround in the

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
games

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
act theft is calling this call for help

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
olr edition

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
nice um

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I still say just

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
you can find a good used

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
card and receiver for not that

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
expensive

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
the new ones 700 bucks

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
each old ones anywhere between

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
150 to 300 bucks

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
and you will never regret it

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
they're fantastic have you tried

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
rebooting your router

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
did you turn this did

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
you turn it off

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
now wait a few seconds

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
and turn it back on no

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
seriously I watched the last

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
episode of Supernatural where they were

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
sort of put into alternate lives and I just the whole

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
tech support thing made me twitch because

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
I've heard all this before and it was

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
anyway I would I love whenever

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I call Comcast to say the cables out and that's the first

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
thing they tell me to do I'll be like okay

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
okay I did it still nothing

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
and I didn't do a damn thing I'm just

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
just sitting there going oh this

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
still doesn't work what I do is

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I I call I

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
I say okay please allow me to say

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
before we begin this discussion

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
yes I have reset my modem I've

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
reset my router I have done a repair

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
on the system and I've gone through all my network settings

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
it is not on my end

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
okay we'll ping it from here

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
that's always what happens

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
can you try opening the call

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
can you do a ping

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
I don't know anyway forget it let's move on

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
enough tech OLR

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
although I do have something

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
to add but I'll do it in last minute stories

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
this may be cool

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Taito

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
guess what Taito is doing

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
they are still doing

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
more first person shooters in the

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
arcades you know

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
they did the half life 2 survivor

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
and now they've got one called

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
cyber driver which is

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
a take on

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
another first

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
person shooter game but it's supposed to have five on

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
five networked play and a different

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
game system so you can see

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
your battle damage in game

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
so it's supposed to be pretty

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
the screen capture looks pretty cool

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
but I'm like meh

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
because first person shooter

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
is high boring

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
unless they're call of duty

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
but it could be cool

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I know

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
well

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
something else that's

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
interesting

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
this kind of goes back

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
to all this

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
stuff we've been talking about alternate services

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
that are going to be not necessarily competing with

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
consoles but

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
are

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
well level 5

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
from the many games

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
that they have put out

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
has announced a new

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
digital distribution service that will be launched

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
in japan in june 1st

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
and it's called

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
roid

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
like roid rage

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
but what's interesting though is

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
one of the first games that they're putting out

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
looks like earthbound

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
not necessarily earthbound

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
might be part of earthbound

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
but looks like earthbound

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
how exactly does the game

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
look like earthbound is it just like

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
sprite based modern

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
you know like set in kind of

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
city type thing looks

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
very earthbound-esque like the sprites

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
look very similar and they're wondering

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
could it be an earthbound game

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
like maybe an earthbound 4 or something like that

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
who knows

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
well

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
interesting I guess we'll see maybe this is something

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
we'll get more details at in a few months

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
and roid for those who may not have heard of it

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
is actually kind of like

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
a little bit like that zebo

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
thing that we were talking about earlier

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
it's its own platform

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
actually looks like one of those

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
the imac ones that they have

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
the little compact ones

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
I don't know it's interesting

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
it's cute

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
and I really dig the font

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
that's kind of interesting when the first thing you notice

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
about a game is the font

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
no the game the little

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
disc thing no I'm just messing

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
it's cute

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
I looked at the screenshots it did look a little bit

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
cute so

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
alright anyhow one more story for you guys

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
then we're going to open up the skype line

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
and it has to do with

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
other rpg series

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
full of fanboy wank we've talked about earthbound

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
a couple times tonight but we have yet to

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
address the wank that is final fantasy 7

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
and of course

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
how many final fantasy 7 fanboys

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
did not get the chance to fap to

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
advent children well advent children complete

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
is apparently the

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
final end of the

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
advent children saga meaning that there

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
is no more special

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
editions or directors cuts or you know

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
hidden scenes or any of that advent children

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
complete is the end of the line

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
which by the way did I not also read somewhere

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
this week that they did confirm this for the US in June

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I want to say yeah but not the cool

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
version with the final fantasy 13

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
demo don't

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
but if you want if you're willing to

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
settle for the one without it or don't want to deal with the

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
import or what have you you can at least get it there in June

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
yes I'm not willing to settle for that so

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
import that bitch

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
however here's the thing

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
final fantasy 7 however as a whole

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
not done

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Nomura has actually come out and said there is

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
still ideas for the next

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
product in the compilation

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
of course why don't you just do the final

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
fantasy 7 remake and then everybody will

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
be the next one coming

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
do you think

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
you think for real I think that final fantasy

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
7 remake is just something that will all

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
only live on in that singular tech

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
demo and in fanboy wank fantasies

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
I think final fantasy 7 will be

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
released on Playstation Network around the time

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
final fantasy 13 shows up especially

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
with the other final fantasies being confirmed for

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
the virtual console I think that's just a matter

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
of time and there'll be

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
plenty of wank and new wank

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
as more people discover the series for the first

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
time

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
but I don't think

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
that final fantasy 7 remake is gonna

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
happen but I'll tell you what all they

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
would have to do is add like

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
tiny little things to

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
final fantasy 7 when they re-release on

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Playstation Network and

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
millions millions sold

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
through Playstation Network millions

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
just say you're gonna up the graphics

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
slightly and just put like fucking smoothing on

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
it or something and it'll sell zillions

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
I want a new remake

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
I actually do want a new

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
remake wank wank wank wank wank

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
seriously well keep in mind

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
final fantasy 7 is actually one of my favorite RPGs

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
ever it was

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
one of the first ones I played on the Playstation I

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
bought the game before I had a

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Playstation if that's any indication

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
so I could play it at my friends

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
house I want final fantasy

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
6 to get the love

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
and adoration first before final fantasy 7

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
gets it but final fantasy 7

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
was really

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
I want to say a milestone

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
in the title and the fact that it brought

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
it into the

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
new realm of 3D

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
seriously and I

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
enjoyed the story I love the characters

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
except for Aerith who I was glad was dead

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
dead dead dead dead

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
after the first disc

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
and then they announced

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
final fantasy 7 Aerith's return

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
you know what I actually would not

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
mind seeing so you can kill her again

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
is them putting in the quest that they took out

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
for the US version where you go back and talk

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
to her ghost

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
hmm

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
that I would like to see actually a fully

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
complete version I think that would be cool

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Bobby's in chat saying I bought my Playstation

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
1 for final fantasy 7 me too

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
you may not know this but me too

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I couldn't afford the system but I damn well knew enough people who had

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
one and I bought the game

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
I made myself broke because I was working

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
in an arcade but still

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
it was super

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
cool

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
I was like oh my god it's 3D

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
and now I'm like oh my god it's blocky

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
alright

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
well we'll see what is next

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
in store for the final fantasy 7

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
sequels upon

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
sequels upon sequels so

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
alright anyhow

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
let's move on and get to the Skype line

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
if you want to give us a call now is a great time

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
to do so 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
our username on Skype is

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
orange lounge radio

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
let's go to the phones and take a call it's already

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
ringing hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
I'm offended

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
whatever

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
on your behalf

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I am offended for you why

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
I don't know I was just gonna say that

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
hey what's up it's Bobby not much hey Bobby

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I'm glad you called because you know

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
you have us on your show every week

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
and yet you know we don't get to hear from you

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
all the time usually because you go to bed

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
probably by this time

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
but we got to the Skype line

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
before midnight eastern tonight so I'm glad

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
to hear from you what's up Bobby what do

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
you think of the show tonight

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
I like the show from what I heard I had to go

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
do other things unfortunately so I'll have to listen

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
to the archive but no I actually had a specific reason

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
to call in and specifically

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
talk about this on your show because I

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
heard about this on your show several weeks ago

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
ok and it's

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
regarding iPhone games

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
and to preface this a little bit

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Apple really takes their user

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
interface and their user experience

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
very seriously when you get

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
into the iPhone developer program there is

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
like this document you have to read through

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
that says this is the user experience

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
we expect for

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
every user of our device

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
and there's one game that

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
completely breaks this user experience

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
and I am very shocked

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
that it's available on the App Store

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
and it's one game that your

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
roommate Rob recommended

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
on this very program

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
oh really and that would be the

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
role playing game he was mentioning a couple weeks ago

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
right, ARVALE

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
A R V A L E, ARVALE

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
it has a lite version and so

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I played the lite version because you know before

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I bought the full version and he probably

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
hasn't seen this because he said he bought the full version

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
so you probably never saw the

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
egregious insult

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
to humanity that

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
ARVALE does

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
it's strictly against Apple's

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
user agreement so basically

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
when you're playing a game on your iPhone or an

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
iPod touch what do you expect to

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
happen when you hit the home button

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
the big square button you're gonna

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
go back to the main menu

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
exactly that's what you would think right

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
right and that's exactly

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
what Apple wants all of their

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
developers to do it it has to do it within a certain

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
time frame so you have

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
like literally like three to five seconds

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
maximum to

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
all your stuff save everything and go back to the

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
home menu well ARVALE

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
decided that is the perfect time

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
for them to try to tell you to get more

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
money in the lite version

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
of ARVALE when you hit the home button

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
it loads up Safari

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
so it goes to the menu and then

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
it loads up Safari which then

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
closes and opens up the app store

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
to a non active

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
URL

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
so it goes to the home page of the app store I think

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
they wanted to actually have it

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
pop up the full version of ARVALE so you

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
could buy it but this happens every

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
single time you close the app

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
interesting I'm on

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
an iPod touch so I don't know if it does that if you

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
get a call because I mean

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
I don't have the phone portions or anything

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
oh god that would annoy me

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
but yeah so when you close the app

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
it takes you

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
to Safari first

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
which then closes immediately

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
and takes you to the app store and it winds

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
up that the URL it gives the app store is not a valid

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
URL so it just goes to

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
the featured front page of the

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
app store interesting

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
no I mean you know

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
since John isn't

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
as into the games as the rest

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
of us are he probably didn't even ever really

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
notice this or maybe just kind of you know put up with

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
it because he enjoyed the game or what have you

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
but that's fascinating why do you think Apple

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
you know aren't these things supposed to be

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I don't know but then again the Apple store is

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
swamped with these types of games

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
so whatever review process they

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
have can't be that thorough

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
so I suppose that's why this type of thing didn't

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
get caught but is it interesting that the game is

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
still on the store

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
after all this

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
it's not that they're not thorough because

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
they would have seen this because it does take

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
several weeks to get approved to go on the app

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
store once you submit it I'm not

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
exactly sure how much I can divulge of

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
it because there is like an NDA involved in stuff

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
but it does take a couple weeks and they do go

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
through and make sure that you're following

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
their user interface guidelines there's

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
several things you cannot do

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
in a game one of which

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
I believe I can go ahead and say is

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
you can't have any buttons on

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
the UI that you can't

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
use so you can't say this

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
button is disabled in the free version you can't

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
do that they will reject your game and they do find

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
that so

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
they do go through and make sure that every

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
in the game

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
in the light version of the game is usable

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
you cannot have any feature that's there

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
but not usable

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
so they go through at least that much because I know

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
a lot of people have complained about getting their stuff

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
sent back because they don't follow

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
these user interface guidelines so I have no

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
clue how RDL lite got away with

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
when you close the game it opens

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
up to other applications I don't know how they got it

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
but that being said I did not play it

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
again I deleted it right then I didn't

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
bother trying any further so I don't know if it's any

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
good or not. Interesting

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
huh that is a pretty shady

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
thing to do though with that

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
that's unfortunate but yeah I know

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
he had the lite version because he was playing it for a little

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
while so

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
but maybe some of us kind of expect

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
that that's what the free games are going to do and it's over

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
if we haven't played so it's interesting to have that insiders

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
perspective that they're technically violating the agreement

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
weird

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
I wonder if anything's going to happen

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
yeah I mean I hope

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
so I should probably report them and stuff but I mean

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
the iTunes reviews don't even mention it

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
there's a

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
then it like opened up three other apps

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
one

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
but like this game is awesome

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
all of our JRPG and stuff so

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
yeah I don't know

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Bobby you're cutting in and out of there a little bit I don't know what

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
that was all about but

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
maybe yeah maybe it's just

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I don't know maybe I have no

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
idea it's so weird that people would not call that

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
out in the reviews either

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
now I kind of want to download it to see

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
if it happens with me too

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
we'll see well they

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
updated it so I

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
you know there's no

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
it's a mindset

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Bobby's cutting in

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
and out really bad Bobby

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
can you still hear us

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
are you guys able

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
to hear me yes we can you're just cutting in and out

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
we have a lot of lag issues going on I don't know what's

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
up with that weird

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
but yeah maybe I don't know could it be that the

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
new patch

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
they put out maybe cut this off

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
maybe

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
hmm interesting

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
so what's this about you guys coming more like

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
FNG with live game play

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
is Loki going to be taking a part

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
of the receiver now no I don't think this is something

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
you can expect every week just when we have something

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
to show you know this is a little special because

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Loki you know I guess

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
thinks he's the second person ever to

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
attack the game like this I'm sure there's many other people

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
the second person that's actually posted on the internet

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I see so you know

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
not a lot of people I guess we could say have done this

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
and he wants to kind of show this off and maybe if we have another

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
special game that we want to show

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
like a Tatsunoko vs Capcom kind of thing

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
we're doing fucking excitebots

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
when that comes out but I'm telling you

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
excitebots hell yeah

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
I don't think you can expect this from us every

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
week no I just like tossing

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
cards we don't have a switcher to switch back and forth from

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
the game to the camera and all that stuff so

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
it's one or the other we don't have the fancy

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
little set up that you

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
three camera set up that you have at the

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
gaming arena as soon as we don't have the camera

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
right now this is what

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
you're going to have to get and it's not a video

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
show and I don't think any of us want it

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
to be a video show right now I think we're all interested

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
maybe in doing well some of us are interested in doing video

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
content for the site but not

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
a video show it's Orange Lounge Radio

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
so

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
alright well Friday night gaming is 8pm eastern

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
5pm pacific on Fridays awesome way to

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
work in that there it is

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
and now a featured Ustream channel so you can watch

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
it on the Ustream app on your phone

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
alright

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
alright take care Bobby

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
bye bye

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
he's cutting out there even at the end what's up with that

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
uh it's deathwishing hello

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
deathwishing what's on your mind

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
uh I've been really pissed off

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
since not last Thursday but the Thursday

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
before that why is that

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
uh well if you didn't know when the

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Call of Duty map 1 came out

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
there were billing problems

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
did you guys hear about that at all

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
no but again admittedly I don't think

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
any of us are rabid Call of Duty players

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
so fill us in on what's up

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
put it this way I bought Microsoft points

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
during this time with a points

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
card

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
and uh I come home

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
I come home right just walking home cause

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
gas uh

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
and uh I'm really excited I enter

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
the code in I get my points right and I'm like

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
cool I'm gonna get the maps it says points are added to my

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
account click the button buy the maps since I have

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
insignificant funds

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
I'm freaking out wait a minute are you on Twitter

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
no I'm not on Twitter

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
okay so okay somebody on Twitter

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
on my Twitter and I'm sorry I think was having this

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
exact same problem so yes I do

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
remember hearing about this because like didn't

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
something break down with like the billing service

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
or something that night and a bunch of people tried to redeem

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
their points they didn't get them okay somebody on

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Twitter was complaining about this exact same thing you're

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
complaining about now that's why I asked this

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
so okay yes I did hear this

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
and I've been talking to Microsoft for

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
since then and they

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
first they told me 5 to 10 days and then after that

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
they told me uh I was

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
gonna get a call and I got the call saying I gotta wait

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
2 to 3 more days after that

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
and which and then the Saturday was supposed to be the

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
third day you know which they said I was supposed to

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
get the points still no points I tried

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
calling and now like they're not taking

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
my call it's

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
wow it's like a bad breakup

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
or something now they're just ditching your call

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
and that's like 20 bucks man

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
I could have done a lot with that like

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
yeah

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
so you never did get the points

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
you're still waiting never got the points still

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
waiting wow they're lucky I'm

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
a patient guy too I'm

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
wondering if it's more than I mean

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
it's gotta be more than just you I should figure out

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
who it was on Twitter and follow up with them too

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
but there's a bunch of people on the Xbox

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
forums that were complaining too well I'm sure

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
some people receive compensation some people

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
still haven't huh so this doesn't

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
have to do necessarily with Call of Duty

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
specifically it's just that it

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
broke Microsoft server somehow

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
well in a way it does have to do with Call of Duty

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
it's due to all the people wanting to

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
play Call of Duty I see

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
huh

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
well I did you were you

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
ever able to get the map pack like did you invest

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
the points later no I still haven't gotten it yet

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
good for you holding out because there's

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
there's some people that are too passive probably

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
myself included that would have just ended up

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
spending the points when the building was fixed I've been playing Call of Duty 4

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
and got it anyway

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
burnout paradise

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
act deft and it says

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Major Nelson covered this in his Twitter maybe it's the

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
person you think it is Rob

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
no I know Major Nelson was responding

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
to it but I distinctly remember there were people on

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
my Twitter like that too it's Major Nelson

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
who took it and he's just sitting in his bathtub

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
wiping his ass with 20 dollar bills

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
with points

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I somehow doubt

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
that the poor guy has to look I do

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
not envy what Major Nelson does okay

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
because he has to take the heat of the

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
entirety of the internet and it's not him

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
that's screwing up you know it's

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
sometimes a computer error or something

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
that's true he gets paid to do it

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
but you know I don't envy him

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Major Nelson's not really a person he's just like

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
the voice on the computer in Star Trek

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
that's all he really is

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
and what you see is just a hologram

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
he doesn't exist

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
it's all a lie

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
like the cake

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
computer error

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
that's what you're going to find out

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
on our very last episode of

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
OLR because someday it has to happen folks

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
there will be a final episode of OLR

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
and that's when the twist is going to be it was all

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
just a dream

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
I just

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
we need to get this problem out there that there are

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
people out here that paid money

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
and not just me I mean other people

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
that have wasted their money

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
and there could be kids

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
you know that don't have there could have been kids

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
buying this stuff they don't have that much money

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
you know

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I know there's definitely a problem out there

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
it's weird that I haven't seen this on a lot of game blogs

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
but then again if I see Call of Duty 4 in the headline

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
or Call of Duty whatever

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
I'd probably scroll past it

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
just because

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
I don't play those types of games myself

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
alright well thank you for helping to get the word out

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
by the way about Final Fantasy 7

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
it's very emo

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
and I did not like it

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
10 was better

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
out of curiosity how old are you?

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
me?

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
I am

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
17

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
see there's something about that particular

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
see I was like 19

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
when the game came out

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
so I don't know if it's something about a generational thing

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
but I notice a lot of younger people

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
like your age and young 20's

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
have a lot more hate for Final Fantasy 7

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
and don't understand what makes it so freaking great

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
but then again

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
I replayed it actually recently

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I know I know but it doesn't stack up to today's games

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
what I'm saying is that at the time

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
it was the shit

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
this is again

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
this is why I bought a Playstation

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
but again it's not for everybody

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I mean I admit that

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
and I don't think Final Fantasy 7 by any means is like the greatest game ever made

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
or any of that so

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
you know

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
many sequels makes me angry

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I like 7 and I like 10

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
it is possible

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
but I also liked 11 for a little while

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
alright anyhow Death Wishing we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
but thank you so much for calling and have a great week okay

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
screw you Microsoft

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
bye

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
hope that stuff gets worked out

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
that sucks that Microsoft is just kinda like

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
a responses thing that's kinda shady

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
in my opinion that's just kinda weird

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
um I think we'll do like one more call

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
guys then we're gonna wrap up cause it's like getting

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
pretty late hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
who's this

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
hello you're on OrangeLawnsRadio

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
who's this

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
is your microphone on

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
sir or madam

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
I guess not

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
alright I'll wait for one more call

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
see

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
what happens

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio who's this

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
take 2 is it actually working this time

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
yes it is hi how are you

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
this is Jason I'm 23 and I'm an addict

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
oh I mean I'm a Final Fantasy 7

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
fan did I get that right

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
close enough what's on your mind buddy

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
no anti fan wank about

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
scratch tonight

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
yeah you know I saw the story in the thread

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
and then I kinda you know

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
but here's the thing is that I figured we kind of

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
already talked about it a couple weeks ago

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
I love how everybody is describing the controller

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
and I have a fucking picture of it it's awesome

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
I know I kind of feel like we already covered it

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
like that this new thing didn't really show us anything we didn't

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
already know or did you catch something we did not

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
which is possible

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
I think it's more the fact that I probably

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
didn't catch it because you guys probably

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
talked to it on a night that I went out to the hockey game

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
and so I didn't I missed the part of the show

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
that you guys talked I am just

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
weeks behind with this crap aren't I

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
it's fine it's fine I tried to

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
break up DDRS you already covered it in your gaming

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
week I'm trying to bring up this it's old news

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
well then

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
don't worry about if you're covering something we've already

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
covered or not tell us what you think because this show

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
is all about the user interaction

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
anyway you are a long time Bamani

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
fan obviously I met you through

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
such avenues as DDR Freak and all this stuff

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
I know you're a Rabid2DX fan what do you think

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
of Scratch? Where every gamer

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
has a voice I

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
it's I have the

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
same feelings for it that I do for Rockband

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
I've said this many times before and I'll

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
continue to say it I've played a lot

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
of Guitar Freaks I've played a lot of Drummania

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Guitar Hero was really fun

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
and then Rockband blew everything right

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
out of the freaking water

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
it's a great game

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Rockband 2 didn't change very much

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
but it's a great game

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
I've

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
loved the Beatmania series I have played one of

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
each of them original Beatmania

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
original yes Beatmania

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Gameboy as Black Wolf showed off

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
on Friday Night Gaming two weeks ago

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I've obviously played lots of

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
2DX and I've played a couple Beatmania 3's

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
including some songs with the foot pedal

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
the thing that's different with Scratch

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
is that I'm not looking

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
forward to it to the majority of

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
the song list because based

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
off what the trailer revealed for the artists

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
I don't care for a lot of those I don't care for

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
a lot of those artists

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
and I'm hoping they bust out some really good

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
electronic music not gonna happen

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
because it's scratching

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
that's why there's not a lot of scratching

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
in electronica but they are trying to

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
feature stuff that would work with that

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
something to put

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
in perspective as well and

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
as much as this hurts to say this game

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
was not made for you and it was not made for

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
me and it wasn't really made for fans of

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Bamani who are kinda ticked off that

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Beatmania never really took off here

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
because of what some would argue was a

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
poor first showing

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
even though DDR had a poor first showing as well

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
and it really grew and took off from there but

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
this game was not made for you and me

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.880
this game was made for folks that want to have an authentic DJing experience

02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:41.160
with a certain genre of music that may not be our preferred genre yeah and the

02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:45.760
American DJ scene is a lot different than overseas scenes I'm pointing more at

02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:50.000
like UK and European very true Japanese very very true they're gonna put stuff

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.800
in it as long as you can scratch to it I mean that's basically gonna be it and I

02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:57.880
hate you know reading that everyone's like oh it's such a ripoff of Beatmania

02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:02.280
yeah it the interface is similar and like it way it's played is similar but

02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:06.300
the whole scratching stuff is totally different than what they've done in

02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:10.400
Beatmania. Beatmania is just another way to hit another button whereas this is

02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:15.400
actually detecting real-life scratch techniques using the crossfader and

02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:19.140
stuff you're doing the same techniques it's like skate you know where you're

02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:23.040
doing techniques that you you can actually do except this you're actually

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:27.560
performing them how you would if you did this on a turntable a real turntable it

02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:31.400
would be it sound exactly the same and again it's hard to say without playing

02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:35.400
it yet but I would say it's very similar to how a lot of people when they first

02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:39.920
saw Guitar Hero were like oh it's just guitar freaks but then when you actually

02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:45.440
play it you're like but it's so much better what made well that's kind of a

02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:49.040
bad comparison only and the Guitar Hero did play the same it just looked a lot

02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:53.960
better because it had the whole 3d landscape and had a solid scrolling and

02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:58.280
way better tailored to the masses yeah absolutely and I completely understand

02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:01.800
that it's just kind of disappointing to the same man at the same time because I

02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:06.840
would really love a DJ sim but again I'm not sure that I'm gonna be a big fan of

02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:10.760
the soundtrack and that's unfortunate all things considered look at the big

02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:13.680
picture though if this game does really really well in this controllers out

02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:17.000
there and it penetrates the marketplace it does open the door for the get type

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:21.260
of game you want in the future so Konami can release beat revolution just to have

02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:25.600
a go the whole bundle for 20 bucks two months later after its release you know

02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:31.640
in a weird way yes and yeah and I think the thing everyone's like getting all

02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:36.400
like a big-ass boner for fucking you know DJ here and we don't even know

02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:41.640
anything about it yet they have a teaser pages like oh my god it's epic it's a

02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:46.160
teaser page it doesn't show anything it's like really know what it's like

02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:50.600
scratch oh wait I mean all it's gonna be is mixing music the other mashups yeah

02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:53.760
that makes me interested in it because you know I kind of like doing that kind

02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:57.000
of stuff I'm really interested in scratch because I've seen what the

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:02.960
controller looks like it's fucking awesome so you know I I don't know I

02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:07.240
it'll be really cool to see when it comes out you know people I'm sure gonna

02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:12.640
say oh it's you know such a ripoff the color wise but the colors match the

02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:17.440
colors of the Xbox 360 controller they match up to what they are on the

02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:20.480
controller because you're gonna be able to play this with a controller if you

02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:23.360
want you know for two-player or something like that so you know you

02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:26.200
don't want to buy another pad or something you can do that with like I

02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:32.040
think the analog six and stuff but it's gonna be pretty awesome and it just it

02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:35.500
really comes down to the song list and the marketing behind it they've got a

02:38:35.500 --> 02:38:39.520
good marketing team it's the marketing team is the guitar hero too you know and

02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:44.120
I think it's gonna be really awesome and you haven't seen everything on it yet

02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:48.480
and they're really gonna start revealing a lot starting pretty much in April and

02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:51.720
onto the release which was originally supposed to be in June but now I hear

02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:59.200
sometime in the summer so you know I I have to reiterate and I know you were

02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:03.120
talking you were you targeted more than people who are complaining at it for the

02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:05.960
sake of complaining I really am looking forward to the game Rob you're

02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:09.480
absolutely right it's oh it's gonna open the door to a lot of good things guitar

02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:14.120
hero open the door to be sold off to be turned into rock band by the same by

02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:18.320
similar companies and as I already said at the top of this that was amazing yes

02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:22.280
the progression that's gonna happen three years down the road stands to be

02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:26.480
excellent absolutely awesome and if I don't like the first game and the second

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:31.320
game has a better soundtrack great absolutely great baby steps Jason we got

02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:34.680
to wrap up and go so we can wrap up the show but do you have any other parting

02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:39.040
thoughts for our listeners tonight I'm trying to think of something witty and

02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:41.880
nothing's coming to me so I guess not Jason what are we gonna hang out again I

02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:45.000
haven't seen you in like five years you know it's funny I was reading the thing

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:48.560
the stuff about e3 coming around again and I kind of want to make that as a

02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:52.400
trip this year I think you should but I don't want to drive that long and I

02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:56.400
probably would be driving and not to mention with the new with the new house

02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:00.480
and whatnot all money situation saving blah blah blah I know I'm trying to work

02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:04.760
on it we have some other ideas and I just need to have some steel deals yeah

02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:08.800
seriously I think our tickets down the southwest because we're going down there

02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:15.280
for Nellie's birthday and for e3 is like $59 $79 we were ridiculous I flew to

02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:20.120
Burbank for 69 and that's like cheaper than what it cost me in gas and you guys

02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:23.620
would definitely be flying again to LA this year and not road tripping like we

02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:27.360
did yeah I'm how does I do yet I might be I might be road tripping I haven't

02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:30.920
decided yet it depends because I don't know how much my husband comes with me

02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:33.360
then I'll be road tripping I don't know how much I want to get into my personal

02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:36.600
life but I might be going to Vegas right after for a personal engagement so if

02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:39.120
that's the case I'm gonna fly because I can't take oh I know what you're talking

02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:46.200
about the reopening that I can't believe that that's cool anyhow Jason we gotta

02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:49.200
let you go but well you know if nothing else you need to make it a point bring

02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:53.040
rye come to Disneyland at some point that sounds pretty awesome although I'm

02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:57.280
kind of a chicken on roller coasters but hey oh it's Disneyland there you go

02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:03.800
that's right you tell him right hey I am the world's biggest chicken and I get in

02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:07.520
the front for this damn that's right me and rye California screaming front front

02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:11.320
row be awesome she'll enjoy that in about 30 seconds when it comes around

02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:14.240
with you Jason and by the way it's actually the Jason and locate can hold

02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:19.760
hands in the back then hey we're not gonna go on but it was a trip I making

02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:24.200
all right Jason I gotta let you go buddy take care I like guys bye what do you

02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:29.120
mean I can be able to go on roller coaster rides no reason okay anyhow

02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:33.560
because because I can't stand the adrenaline rush and Nelly gets sick she

02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:36.960
gets motion sick really easy actually all right well you guys so do I but not

02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:39.960
in the front row you guys can just ride the fucking pair of tires you were right

02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:45.080
it's a small world over and over again if whatever in the middle I'd get six

02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:51.600
six six six six sitting in the front no problem awesome all right that's it we

02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:55.120
get a wrap we're trying to wrap up get out of here and get to our afterbirth

02:41:55.120 --> 02:41:57.840
and all that stuff but we've had a wonderful show tonight yes Jamie I want

02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:03.520
to know who is interested in winning a turbo graphics 16 with no controllers

02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:10.120
no plug no hookups just a turbo graphics 16 and they go along with that I have a

02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:14.560
Sega Saturn to the same same deal there so to Saturn maybe we can sign them or

02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:18.680
something we'll sign them even though I don't think our signatures are worth

02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:21.600
that much but I'm sure some of our listeners let us know the mailbag who's

02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:25.800

sick people okay last-minute story since I forgot to get to that a dark soccer I

02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:55.800
think you said you had one that was a holdover for the mailbag actually that

02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:58.880
was it I have to graphic 16 I'm giving it away

02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:02.520
Loki did you have anything tonight or yeah I had a few things okay they're

02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:07.040
first off there's Star Trek DAC we heard a little bit about it was teased on DVD

02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:10.600
release that they had for the Star Trek series it's actually going to be an

02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:15.680
Xbox Live and PlayStation Network title a little bit similar to what we saw with

02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:21.400
what was it the Bellstar Galactica thing so that's gonna be good or bad I'm not

02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:23.560
sure how you can take it but supposed to come out around the same time as the

02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:27.920
movie so within the next month or so Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 was announced

02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:31.520
actually I think last week and there's some more information coming out about

02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:36.480
that the game of course is going to be a kind of a port or I don't know what

02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:40.960
Ninja Gaiden black was to Ninja Gaiden say or Sigma the first one it basically

02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:44.800
they're gonna take Ninja Gaiden 2 and they're going to add a bunch of stuff in

02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:47.800
there including there's going to be dead or lives

02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:52.440
Ayane in there as well they're gonna bring back the chick from the first game

02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:59.600
I think and there's also the female warrior from Ninja Gaiden dragon sword

02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:06.120
which is on the DS so that's kind of neat file front is shutting down so no

02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:12.400
more patches and demos from that site which is too bad speaking of iPhone

02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:16.320
games nobody nobody boy has been announced to be coming to the iPhone

02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:23.520
that's scary there's another thing to they're saying that nobody nobody boy I

02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:33.240
guess she was saying that in order to get to the end of I guess Pluto it would

02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:36.920
take a hundred twenty years of the current rate right now so I don't know

02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:39.640
if we'll ever see the end of this game or if they even program the end of this

02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:44.760
game and then rob kind of alluded to it a little bit ago that we're gonna be

02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:48.840
seeing some Final Fantasy tiles on the virtual console including there's I

02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:53.000
think the cell phone gave me that had was sequel to Final Fantasy for the

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.160
after years as well which is pretty sweet and of course one that I know Rob

02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:00.200
was excited about Hello Kitty online has been announced to be coming to the US

02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:03.240
how did we miss that on Cheryl tonight I don't even know maybe I'm waiting for

02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:07.680
the game to come out itself and one other iPhone app that I saw a little

02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:16.080
thing on apparently there's an iPhone fart app that had apparently yippy

02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:25.280
apparently the iPhone phone app aromatic and there that's the maker of pull my

02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:29.320
finger apparently they're in negotiations to sell dispute pull my

02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:34.440
finger once upon a time I guess was an application on the iTunes Store and

02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:40.720
apparently was being overtaken by I fart which is now done two hundred thousand

02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:47.840
dollars in sales since its release and now they're I guess saying that it's

02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:55.960
been kind of ripping off of the one of the other I guess and there's some

02:45:55.960 --> 02:46:03.200
patent lawsuits I guess I don't know really it's a farting app for the iPhone

02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:06.920
do we really need this no we don't answer your question

02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:10.720
all right let's go around to your base final thoughts we can wrap up and get

02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:19.040
the hell out of here for tonight dark soccer and my final thought is wine is

02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:25.520
tasty did it help to chill the glass Rob I didn't show long enough this is my

02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:29.160
favorite one I did I can definitely tell leaving the bottle open really ruined

02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:36.160
the way it was yummy on Friday your final thought my final thought is and

02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:40.840
this is just kind of a PSA but just remember that this Wednesday happens to

02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:46.680
be the first day of a certain month namely April which people like to pull

02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:51.240
pranks and announce fake things and whatnot so just be wary of anything

02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:55.360
that's being announced next week as there's a very likely chance that's

02:46:55.360 --> 02:47:00.040
gonna be fake and most people if they have legitimate to announce they're not

02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:06.120
gonna do it next week so just be aware I got a thought for the contest of giving

02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:11.320
shit away if we wanted to like take those things those Saturn in the

02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:16.600
turbo graphics and take them to e3 and get like Bobby and Scott and all them to

02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:19.560
sign it then they might be worth a little more cuz they have all of our

02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:21.880
signatures on it and how often are we all under one roof

02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:26.560
hmm I might be Scott was on TV years ago I mean his autographs were something

02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:32.200
right I don't know the only one left of us on TV too that's true we were on the

02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:38.720
