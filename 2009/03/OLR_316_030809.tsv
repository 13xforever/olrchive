13936	18078	Tonight, March 8th, 2009, are Xbox elites on their way out?
18459	23722	New King of Fighters 12 details are revealed, and are our boy and his blob set to make a comeback?
31547	31907	DarkSakura
59162	59683	Interesting.
60203	60764	Interesting?
61284	61724	Interesting.
62565	63806	Interesting good or interesting bad?
63826	66849	Because interesting is a very interesting term.
67009	67770	Interesting neutral.
68030	68871	Okay, fair enough.
69711	72073	Suddenly I feel like we're talking about D&D alignments or something.
72734	73855	You're chaotic interesting.
74015	74536	It's funny.
74716	79440	I took a D&D alignment test and I'd taken the same one before and it came out chaotic good before.
79880	81222	This last time I came out true neutral.
81902	83143	But feelings change.
83183	84965	How long ago was it that you took the test?
85612	86793	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
114687	115668	How you doing, Techmaster Loki?
116008	116248	Fine.
116629	116829	Yeah?
117089	117269	Yeah.
117369	117970	You have a good week?
118350	119591	Yeah, it was a pretty good week.
119871	122273	I understand you finally got to Airsoft today.
122353	123114	Yes, finally.
123174	123614	How was that?
123954	124515	It was fun.
124535	127838	I don't know, we played like three games.
128578	134343	We played at a different place than normal because I didn't want to drive an hour to where we normally play.
134923	137946	So we played at a field next to my work.
138766	140187	And it was pretty nice.
140448	142870	And there's lots of rocks because...
144670	145190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
166454	174898	There's cobblestone hills that we were on top of and there's a bunch of eucalyptus trees that they planted there for some reason so it's like a big jungle out there.
175979	177680	First person shooters for real, right?
177840	178200	Yep.
178800	181822	I got to try out one of my new guns and it's so awesome.
182982	185544	My other guns, my older ones, not so awesome.
187011	205651	and of course there's always you guys who join us here every week on Orange Lounge Radio when we tape live and you can join us in our chat room live chat.orangeloungeradio.com or we're on the Game Surge Network for you IRC fans at channel Orange Lounge and the first comment tonight from Shadowrunner Xbox is awesome until the red ring of death and then it's fail
206667	207127	Good point.
207207	211031	You know, the Xbox has taken a lot of crap for the Red Ring.
211071	216575	And sure, Microsoft's, you know, kind of done the whole, you know, oops, our bad, we're going to extend the warranties and all that on that.
216876	225883	But it makes me think of an article, if I can work in a cheap plug here, for the neworangeontradio.com website, which has actually been, you know, thanks to our new writing staff, has had a pretty constant stream of new articles.
225903	226864	Like I say, it's pretty awesome.
226904	233429	And one of them was written by Breslow earlier this week, and he was kind of talking about, is it just me, or are these new console systems...
234190	237293	Just not built to last, like the old ones.
237633	242316	He was kind of saying, I could probably still find a Nintendo that works, or a Super Nintendo that works.
242657	249702	And come to think of it, I was kind of reading the article and thinking, yeah, I don't think I ever, ever had a console break until the Xbox 360.
250723	267395	but then there's also another argument that says well look consoles broke all the time you just didn't hear about it because now the internet culture you know one person's console breaks in a you know over the top way and it hits every game blog on the internet and you know millions of people read about it kind of different interesting schools of thought
268815	269355	I don't know.
270116	277698	Old school 8-bit NESs might still work, but you still have to blow on the cartridge and blow in the system to get it to work.
278358	280078	Unless you're lucky enough to have a top loader.
281639	286100	With the 360, it's basically praying that it's not going to break.
286540	291021	It's like if you look at it funny, it's like, I'm going to die now.
292202	293002	I hope you're happy.
294264	298526	I know, you just kind of hope that it's going to last the full three years or whatever.
298546	301228	Well, it's just like the 360 that I fixed that's modded.
303068	305009	I'm just surprised each day that it works.
305029	309352	Because it's like, there's no reason that this should work, but it is.
309752	310692	Every day is a new gift.
311112	311953	Yes, exactly.
313503	316984	GS68 in chat says, hey, some of my Super Nintendo games don't work anymore.
317304	318324	Here's what I'm curious about.
320785	323966	Those batteries, remember how batteries were only supposed to last like five years?
324106	326927	The batteries that they have in the Zelda games or the battery backup?
327207	330948	Did anybody ever read the fine print that those things were only supposed to last five years?
331088	332048	Do some of those still work?
332128	333808	I've never heard of those batteries really failing.
333828	334949	My Zelda cartridge finally died.
335169	335629	Did it really?
335729	335949	It did.
336349	340050	Also, the same lithium batteries are used in the Sega Saturn.
341311	343252	Mine have had to be replaced a couple times.
344593	345794	Wow.
345874	352358	BlackWolf, plugging his other show in chat, we learned on Friday Night Gaming that blowing on the cartridge actually does nothing.
352739	355560	It was the readjusting into the cartridge slot that fixed it.
355881	361304	See, I always thought it was the moisture that you, when you were blowing on the cartridge, it was the moisture from your breath was helping with the contacts.
361324	363946	That's what I always thought was the... Oh, interesting.
364126	365767	We used to just take alcohol swabs.
366288	367509	It all depends on how...
368607	371249	What condition are your consoles in, you know, in your games?
371569	377693	If you leave your games out and they're super dusty, then blowing in it, I can imagine, would, you know, fix that a little bit.
378554	390201	But yeah, usually it's the contacts on the inside that are really dirty, and thankfully they did have the NES cleaning kit, and you could, you know, do that, and then you see the contacts, and they come out all black, and you're like, wow.
390282	393123	One more comment from chat, and then we'll get to how was your gaming week.
393324	398167	We have Say in chat says, I've only ever had my PS1 break caught on fire.
399208	402831	I can't... I would freak the hell out if that ever happened with a gaming system.
402851	405093	Can you imagine a gaming system catching fire?
405613	407054	Dude, what did you do with that system?
407074	409917	Was it like a 48-hour Final Fantasy VII marathon or something?
409937	411218	How did your system catch fire?
411638	413360	Or maybe it wasn't properly vented.
413440	413840	I don't know.
415622	419385	Some of those systems... Or he poured gasoline on it and set it on fire.
420726	423148	I don't think that would be a whoops mistake.
423288	423709	I don't know.
424369	424870	Alright, let's...
426564	429945	Breaking these consoles in all these intricate ways makes me think back.
429985	433927	Do you guys remember the SmashMyWii.com or whatever it was?
434247	435007	I could be mistaken.
435027	439829	Where they stood in line all night long to buy a Wii only so they could break it.
439849	441049	Yeah, they do that all the time.
442110	443270	The novelty is worn off.
443390	444190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
471741	473042	and Sage just followed up in chat.
473082	474482	It was some 24-hour thing.
474922	475943	So, there you go.
476303	478104	Alright, let's get to how was your gaming week.
479124	480945	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
480965	482125	What kind of games did you play this week?
482345	484086	Played Ragnarok Online and that's about it.
485026	486367	Getting back into the Ragnarok, huh?
487031	490574	Dan found all of our Guilty Gear figures today and a few Mega Drive cartridges and stuff.
516872	518593	Awesome.
518633	520094	I found a copy of Policenauts.
521154	521454	Wow.
522355	522915	That's random.
524075	525236	Hey, I got a question.
525276	526196	I haven't asked this in a while.
526236	527557	Whatever happened with Ragnarok 2?
527597	528898	I haven't heard anything on that in a while.
528998	529658	Did that ever release?
529918	530438	I don't care.
531339	531899	You weren't a fan?
531939	532679	It's still in beta.
532880	533340	I don't care.
533600	534700	After all this time?
534820	536221	It's been in beta for like two years.
536841	538482	How long was the first Ragnarok in beta?
539463	539983	I guess that's true.
540143	541744	You played with me in the beta.
541784	542624	I remember, yeah.
542664	543324	It was a long time ago.
543344	544165	With your mage with a bow.
544185	544445	Yeah.
546431	550424	Deathwishing in chat says Ragnarok is way too confusing
551530	552691	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
576547	578207	But it's also a different kind of game, right?
578227	582488	Because if you go to this game after playing something like, I don't know, Warcraft, it's different.
582629	583069	It's easier.
584029	587270	Ragnarok Online is infinitely easier than World of Warcraft.
588350	597892	But the thing that I think that people don't like about it is that you don't have someone holding your hand and allocating your points for you.
598872	603574	You're not, you know, maybe it's because they expect you to fucking use your brain to allocate your points.
604514	604834	You know.
606340	606720	All right.
608221	609382	Am I right or am I right?
609703	611104	It's been so long since I've played.
611384	612325	I honestly can't tell you.
612345	613866	I don't even remember how the damn game works.
614006	615407	I remember the porings were really cute.
615427	616027	That's what I remember.
616067	616908	World of Warcraft.
618589	622672	Well, I don't want to say it necessarily handholds you in how to distribute your point, but here's the thing.
622712	634461	Warcraft is so infinitely popular, you can go onto websites upon websites to tell you how to build your character, and then you get these elitist raiders that if you don't shape your character a certain way, then you are suck.
634761	637443	But in the end, it's all basically your armor.
638183	640104	Or the stuff you've got on you that controls it.
640785	648329	In Ragnarok, if you kill creature, creature, creature, you can go put all of it in your intelligence and have a mage.
648709	649650	Intelligence and dex.
650090	657434	If you want, say if you're playing an assassin, you put it all in your agility, a little bit in strength, and a lot of it in dex, and boom!
657574	659536	You can hit and hit a lot.
660236	661457	So, you know...
661997	668921	And on top of that, your armor and your accessories are all in addition to what you do.
669061	671383	So it's not really that confusing.
671423	673504	You just have to know what you want.
675325	679348	BlackWolf in chat, If I wanted to use my brain, I wouldn't rot them away playing a video game.
679748	681489	He says with a little hint of sarcasm.
682529	684290	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
685071	686732	I played Lost and Damned.
686772	688333	And that's it.
689392	690212	Just multiplayer.
690412	692253	I didn't get around to doing much of anything.
692273	696414	I'm trying to figure out why that was.
697334	698094	Oh yeah, I remember now.
700114	704575	Because I was trying to hack the Lost and Damned, and it's fucking hard.
705095	708036	So, yeah.
709296	710496	So no luck there.
710837	711857	Because apparently they have...
713339	715341	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
731870	735713	It's so complicated that it just fries my brain thinking about it.
736253	740317	But I want to do it because you can edit it just like the PC because it has the same format and stuff, so that'll be fun.
742398	743739	But yeah, that's pretty much that.
743879	745601	And then I did find my...
747102	755448	DS Lite I'm getting from work Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Killzone 2 Not that I'm really excited about it because I don't give a shit about Resident Evil but I'll play it anyways, whatever
774740	776062	Killzone 2 looks interesting.
776102	778465	I wasn't going to buy it, though, so thank God I don't have to pay for it.
779126	782651	But Mad World, holy shit, I can't wait to play that game.
783032	784534	So that'll be one I'll be playing next week.
784894	786597	But lots of fun stuff coming up.
788852	791534	My gaming week, I didn't have time to play a whole lot.
792114	794955	I did check out Quake Live for a brief little bit.
795536	797276	Now that the queues apparently aren't such an issue.
797316	801058	Like, you know, the first couple days you try to get in there, you had these queues that were like thousands of people long.
801078	802479	It's just like, yeah, right, you're not going to get in there.
802819	809962	But finally I snuck in there one night and got to play because I think they finally eliminated the queues or really opened up the servers or something or the fever just died down.
809982	811223	So it's really easy to get in there now.
811563	812784	So I did play for a little bit.
813224	813404	I don't...
813964	820247	I was surprised because I don't know why, but I was under the impression that Quake Live was a new version of the original Quake.
820347	820688	It's not.
820728	821708	It's based off Quake 3.
822529	826070	Even, like, the same voice, you know, and all that stuff.
826911	828752	So I was, you know, kind of pleasantly surprised.
828772	830533	I like how it does that skill match in the beginning.
830553	834214	In the very beginning, when you sign on to Quake Live, you have to play a 10-minute match against a computer opponent.
834515	840057	It gets a little harder as you, you know, start kicking her butt, and then, you know, it gets a little easier if she starts killing you a lot.
840097	842118	So it's supposed to skill match you with other opponents.
842178	842899	So, you know...
843419	843999	Thanks for watching!
867805	868925	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
896635	899176	I had a good time with Quake Live, the little time I spent with it.
899196	900516	I want to go back and revisit it.
900916	903337	I also played some Rock Band, too, because I love me some Rock Band.
903377	905157	Spent an obscene amount of money on new songs.
905177	906818	I don't know why I waste my money like that, but I do.
906838	910699	I was like, oh, I have to play No Doubt and New, and I really want to play White Zombie.
910719	913300	I have two drum sets, and I use neither of them.
913420	914080	Oh, my gosh.
914520	915300	Maybe I should borrow one.
915340	916460	I need to get my drum achievements.
916600	916941	I don't know.
917001	918121	I've got one.
918661	920321	It's the wireless one with the cymbals.
921042	921982	I have the cymbals for it.
922082	922302	Really?
922322	922402	Yeah.
922722	928426	Yeah, and they're kind of... And I have a drum bag to carry the drums.
928466	930427	I was thinking about getting that little portable one.
930507	931488	I don't know how well they work.
931668	932849	Don't get that.
933109	933629	Is it terrible?
933669	934490	It looks like crap.
934550	939673	Well, I don't know, but it looks... You know, I like the idea that it doesn't take up all this freaking space in my house.
939733	942135	You know, you kind of just put it out on the table and play.
942355	943076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
964221	965161	And here's the other thing.
965961	973903	Also in my gaming week, I downloaded the demo for The Last Remnant, but I haven't checked it out yet, so I don't know why I mentioned it, but I'm going to check that out this next week because I'm curious.
973923	977744	If it's really, really good, I might just get it on 360, but I'm also kind of curious how it's going to run on PC.
979184	989447	And then also, I wanted to go back and play Civilization IV because, you know, after video games live and everything and seeing little slideshows, I was like, oh, I need to get back into Civilization and play this game again.
989467	990747	So I remembered it was on GameTap.
991147	991547	Thanks for watching!
1010718	1013759	I'm locked into their current ones, so I'm not going to get shifted or whatever.
1013819	1016159	But I don't know if I really like the direction game tab setting.
1016219	1016919	I have to be honest.
1017899	1020940	As a fair critic, I don't know if I necessarily like.
1021060	1022980	And I can't really judge until it happens.
1023340	1028981	But now they have this whole thing where the arcade games are going to actually be playable in the browser window.
1029001	1031782	Some of the classic games, and now some of the other stuff.
1031802	1037263	They're kind of turning into this hybrid of Steam and what sounds to me like Pogo games.
1037823	1039484	I don't want to pay for Pogo games.
1039524	1039984	You know what I mean?
1040424	1040884	So I don't know.
1041025	1045006	I'm going to withhold my full judgment until it comes out.
1045466	1045967	But I don't know.
1046007	1048788	I'm just not happy either that some of these things just won't work in Vista.
1049088	1051489	And I understand the games are old.
1051669	1053510	They were made for a certain Windows system.
1053550	1055471	It's my fault for being stupid and having Vista.
1055551	1056952	But look, that's what my computer came with.
1056992	1057612	So that's all I have.
1057852	1060553	I keep seeing advertisements for good old gaming.
1060993	1062634	I don't know if it's a website.
1062694	1064255	It's like Steam or something.
1064395	1064535	Yeah.
1064935	1065496	Thanks for watching!
1082218	1083959	DarkTetsuya in chat says, I agree.
1084019	1087400	We haven't used it in a long time, especially since they're all about PC ports nowadays.
1087460	1089060	Now, you know, call me stupid if you want.
1089120	1089621	I don't care.
1089681	1091381	I made an impulse buy a few months ago.
1091461	1092922	Not that you've ever made impulse buys, Loki.
1093302	1094882	I bought a full year of GameTap up front.
1095302	1098043	So I'm locked into this thing for a year, whether I like it or not.
1098223	1101564	So at least, you know, I'll have a chance to give it a full review, and maybe it'll win me over.
1102064	1103185	I just don't like what I'm hearing.
1103205	1103525	That's all.
1104085	1108489	So, you know, I kind of look at these changes and I go, oh boy, alright, I'm going to have to see this in motion.
1108889	1110910	But, you know, I guess in the end it is all about the games.
1111191	1115414	And if they can make it so that Civ 4 will magically work in Windows Vista, I don't know what they have to do.
1115794	1118216	I imagine if they emulate all these old games, there's got to be a way to do it.
1118276	1120798	Civ 4 is not like an obscure game.
1121099	1125022	Couldn't you run it, like, say in the compatibility mode with XP or something like that?
1125582	1126263	Run GameTap?
1126843	1127824	How about compatibility mode?
1138857	1139597	I just said that.
1139777	1140538	Yeah, I don't know.
1140978	1142999	Well, I finally got to use Vista.
1144859	1151702	My wife's co-worker wanted me to find her some stuff to put onto her system.
1152382	1153643	All legit software, of course.
1154563	1156924	So I hate Vista.
1157944	1159825	It sucks really bad.
1160765	1163527	It's just the hand-holding stuff really pisses me off.
1163967	1164467	I disagree.
1165985	1166325	I don't know.
1166465	1167906	I'm iffy on it.
1168026	1171347	These compatibility type issues make me a little irked with Vista.
1171507	1173888	I think I'm more looking forward to the new Windows than I am.
1173948	1175989	I'm kind of like, Vista's a stepping stone for me.
1176609	1177509	I don't like Vista now.
1177569	1181271	My system is completely tailored around running it.
1182191	1183732	So that's just how it was when I bought it.
1184332	1186853	So it runs like a dream on my computer.
1187153	1187933	Yeah, it's fast.
1188353	1191594	I mean, on my computer it's well optimized and everything, but it's just, I don't know.
1191814	1195595	I disabled all the touchscreen stuff because it was fucking with my tablet.
1196295	1201096	And I disabled a few things here and there, but then again, I've always tweaked XP to get it to run how I want it to.
1201616	1205657	I tweak every OS I get my hands on to make it run the way I want it to.
1205797	1206397	And guess what?
1206497	1210418	Right now, my Vista runs like XP with a few goodies.
1212999	1214740	I bet you wouldn't be able to play Civ 4 either.
1216060	1217321	Actually, I probably would be able to.
1218141	1219361	If you can get it to work, let me know.
1219521	1225463	City of Heroes gave me compatibility issues and I just changed it to run in compatibility mode and boom, no problem.
1225884	1226404	I'll check it out.
1226464	1228805	Maybe it is something that simple and I'm just being stupid.
1228845	1230265	All it did was change my resolution.
1230705	1231665	That's certainly a possibility.
1231726	1233026	And then it changes it back when it's done.
1233777	1234317	Alright, we'll see.
1234498	1235358	I'll try it, I'll try it.
1235779	1240983	I'll try to dig into compatibility mode, so, and then I'll get all those emails this week, you idiot, it was super easy.
1241243	1245006	Then GameTap will email me, you idiot, stop talking negative about our service and you can't figure it out.
1245246	1253472	But at the same time, I would think, if GameTap's going to give me an error message about not being able to start the game, it should tell me, hey, you should think about running in compatibility mode.
1253492	1256054	Of course, it could have been right in front of my face and I was just too pissed off not to see it.
1256334	1256554	Anyhow.
1257415	1263420	Alright, let's get into... Yeah, an ex-Link in chat says, I have Civ 4 and I run it off Vista.
1263500	1264000	So I don't know.
1264881	1266302	Maybe I'm doing something wrong, we'll see.
1266783	1269945	And I can fully admit, look, I'm not the biggest computer genius in the world.
1269965	1273808	I can just get you Civ 4, you know, so that you could play it without GameTap.
1275730	1277111	Maybe that's what I'll be forced to do.
1277131	1278672	Because I will feel that sense of entitlement.
1278692	1279192	That's right!
1279232	1281154	GameTap forced you!
1281214	1284236	They forced you into this, okay?
1284417	1284757	Alright.
1286448	1287689	Let's move on with the show.
1287749	1290971	We have some housekeeping to get into, and then we're going to get into tonight's show.
1291352	1300478	Hey, over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com right now, live tonight during the show, Orange Lounge Radio March Madness, the Elite Eight is wrapping up right now.
1301058	1302279	And check that out.
1302679	1303279	You can vote.
1304000	1306442	There's some pretty epic matchups going on in the top eight right now.
1306542	1309203	Final Fantasy VI versus Chrono Trigger.
1309584	1313206	Before the show tonight, Chrono Trigger was leading, but a lot can change.
1313246	1314307	That's a pretty epic matchup.
1315327	1319508	So you can go vote in that and the final four will be announced a little later tonight after the show.
1320368	1323329	And keep an eye on OrangeLaunchRadio.com for that throughout the week.
1323689	1330090	Also, we have some more people writing on OrangeLaunchRadio.com and now we have some new segments that showed up out of the blue that I'm loving.
1330870	1331930	I heart that song.
1332311	1336911	They've actually kind of been, I guess, using the classic game of the week a little bit as an inspiration.
1336971	1342993	Some of our staff writers have been writing these tributes to great songs in gaming, which has been kind of cool.
1343433	1344413	And, you know, just some
1344793	1348976	Other great segments on OrangeLaunchRadio.com Very happy with the direction the new site's going.
1349856	1351638	Alright, I guess that's it for housekeeping.
1351678	1355180	Don't forget LiveJournal, Facebook, MySpace, all that good stuff.
1355240	1357662	Let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki.
1358462	1360683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1380470	1381872	Xbox Live Arcade Game Night
1405447	1409068	And if I remember correctly, I think Hasbro Family Game Night is actually like five different games.
1409708	1410188	Yeah, it is.
1410268	1412909	It's like Sorry and a bunch of the old classic games.
1413049	1417770	So I don't know if on the 18th they're going to get like five games all of a sudden, but whatever.
1418910	1425371	Also coming out will be The Dishwasher Dead Samurai, which if you remember was that really kick-ass XNA game.
1426292	1427472	Finally now an actual game.
1428312	1431313	Flock, Outrun Online Arcade, Puzzle Quest Galactrix, Uno Rush, and Lode Runner.
1450043	1452665	Those all sound pretty awesome, actually.
1452745	1453245	I don't know, though.
1453265	1460010	I don't get the same thrill out of Hasbro Family Game Night that I did out of Geometry Wars 2 and some of the things that came out this summer.
1460490	1469276	But I understand Xbox has a family-friendly niche they need to fill pretty badly to compete with Nintendo, so I'm okay with it.
1469316	1470617	I understand why they need stuff like that.
1470637	1471558	It all depends what games.
1471718	1475421	I can't remember what they had in the Hasbro Family Game Night if they actually had...
1476986	1478087	Battleship might be fun
1502299	1502859	I could see that.
1502879	1504179	Yeah, I could see it too.
1504940	1507700	A lot of love being lavished upon Galaga Legions in our chatroom.
1507740	1511021	SonofDad says Galaga Legions was the best last year.
1511101	1512901	SonicM88, I loved Galaga Legions.
1512921	1514502	That was a pretty good release in the last batch too.
1514582	1517222	No, I didn't actually... I think I downloaded that.
1517242	1518603	I'm not sure if I bought it or not.
1520103	1521243	I downloaded it and played the demo.
1521263	1521883	It was pretty cool.
1521903	1526724	But that was right around the same time that I also got Space Invaders Extreme on my PSP and I just kind of ended up playing that instead.
1528125	1528625	Yeah...
1529656	1532457	I think, didn't Duke Nukem 3D come out during that time too?
1533158	1533638	I think it did.
1534038	1534298	Yeah.
1534318	1535579	I think that was one of the big releases too.
1535639	1539420	Yeah, that was another one like Doom where I was like, oh my god, it's Doom!
1540080	1544682	They played multiplayer online like once and I was like, okay, I'm going on to other things now.
1545743	1547744	But I heard, aren't they making like a Galaga Legions 2?
1547884	1549524	Didn't we have a story on the show a few weeks ago about that?
1549544	1550465	That they're doing like a second one?
1550990	1551630	I don't know about that.
1551650	1554031	Is there some type of other reiteration in Galaga?
1554131	1554412	I don't know.
1554992	1556032	It would be pretty awesome if they did.
1556873	1561075	Hey, the Xbox Elite is being phased out apparently.
1561175	1562775	This is the rumor going around the internet this week.
1562815	1566377	Apparently the Xbox 360 is going to be more of like a limited edition type of console.
1566397	1567738	It's not going to be so readily available.
1568378	1571820	It's because retailers are not as happy about the Elite apparently.
1571940	1573320	You know, the economy the way it is.
1573660	1576542	A system that costs, what, $200 more than the entry level system.
1576562	1576682	Yeah.
1577282	1578865	It's not doing too well.
1578985	1587138	So apparently Microsoft might actually be limiting the console sales to only select retailers across North America and Europe.
1587779	1591045	Apparently the Elite might just phase out altogether in quarter two.
1592093	1592953	Yeah, I don't know about that.
1594374	1598737	I mean, at least as far as when I'm selling it, we have tons of it on hand.
1598817	1600938	So it won't be going away anytime soon.
1600978	1612564	But I know they're doing... Well, I've also... And some thought is that maybe they're phasing this out in favor of the elites will be out for the Resident Evil 5 red box elite system.
1612785	1617907	And then when that phases away and the next big Xbox game comes out, there'll be a limited edition system for that.
1617927	1618688	It's just that they're going to...
1618948	1628496	They could be treating it like Sony's doing with their higher end systems like the 160GB system now that's bundled with a game.
1629496	1630197	They may be doing that.
1630557	1634941	I can see because right now the Elite by itself doesn't seem like a great deal.
1636122	1638944	But when you have the Resident Evil release
1639505	1639925	Thanks for watching!
1655845	1656446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1677406	1678046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1705831	1706931	They should just do it.
1726866	1729209	Or something, or a noise filter, I don't know.
1729950	1742485	Maybe you should find some sort of noise trapping material, like some sort of, not like how metal would reflect, but maybe a rubber mat or something to put underneath it.
1743248	1752975	Or maybe finding a different type of... Some cabinets that you can put your systems in actually can put a glass window in front of it with just the little thing for the cords and that kind of filters out the sound.
1753055	1753355	I don't know.
1753935	1765363	Or you get the integrated audio-video setup where it's actually a plug in your wall and you put another one in another room and then you put your system in the other room since the wireless controllers can reach within 30 feet.
1765683	1768145	Then you go, it's another room and you don't have to hear it.
1768445	1771547	Or I could just fucking deal with it as I have for the past few years.
1771587	1772908	That's definitely the way to go.
1773869	1774909	But then I can't hear the game.
1774989	1776471	Or I can get headphones.
1776691	1778292	Yeah, that's another thing.
1778332	1779153	Headphones are good.
1779373	1783096	Or you set it next to a PC that's even louder and then it doesn't matter.
1783296	1785097	Like the Orange Lounge Radio PC.
1785237	1788820	Oh, that's nothing compared to... I don't know if you can hear the monster fan on this thing.
1788940	1791902	It is... I have the loudest... Have you seen my PC?
1793323	1793984	Not in a long time.
1794024	1796386	With its 200mm fan on top of it?
1797086	1797286	Mm-mm.
1797927	1799368	And it's got like, you know...
1801429	1811091	8 different fans that are on it, plus there's 3 more inside the case, plus there's a fan on each of the graphics cards that are also hacked to be 100% all the time.
1812031	1813992	It's like a jet engine.
1814452	1816372	Alright, I don't want to bitch about noise anymore.
1816412	1819953	People are probably sick of it, but I do want to read a comment from chatroom because this made me lull a little bit.
1820813	1827195	The comment from chat was from SonOfDad says, Hannah Montana, Xbox 360 Elite SKU for me, please.
1827295	1828055	PSP's doing it.
1828655	1830055	There you go.
1830195	1831076	Baby poop purple.
1831636	1832476	Xbox 360.
1833896	1843139	If you want to join us in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com Well, you know, Rob, that her new movie, she's going to have to choose whether she's going to be Miley Cyrus or Hannah Montana.
1843619	1845379	How about she chooses to go jump in a lake?
1845599	1847080	That would be... Or death.
1847480	1848320	Chooses death.
1849975	1852877	If I can't be both, then I won't be any.
1854697	1856138	I'll just have to chop myself in half.
1857218	1858559	Let's move on with more gaming news.
1858619	1861820	Please do not let Loki ruin my show with Hannah Montana.
1863201	1863921	Dear God, no.
1864902	1868864	Well, how about something that I'm sure a lot of people have been waiting for.
1869624	1871165	Rob, maybe you've been waiting for this.
1871225	1871585	I don't know.
1871685	1872005	What's that?
1873123	1874905	The Beatles on Rock Band.
1875625	1877507	Actually, it's the Beatles Rock Band Edition.
1878408	1881851	A collaboration between AppleCore, Harmonic, and MTV Games.
1882072	1886756	And it's going to be all Beatles music.
1886876	1892662	They're basically saying that they don't have any plans yet for downloadable content.
1892702	1898107	But it is going to be standalone, dedicated, just to the Beatles.
1898925	1903268	So no importing your songs into other rock band games or any of that stuff is what it seems to imply.
1903448	1904769	It's going to be all by itself.
1905389	1907190	Which, you know, it's the Beatles.
1907270	1907971	They can do that.
1908031	1910052	They're like the biggest band ever.
1910793	1911093	Ever.
1911853	1915455	And if you doubt this, of course I'm excited about a Beatles rock band game.
1915636	1918137	Especially more so than some of these other bands.
1918197	1920318	We've heard Metallica, Aerosmith.
1920399	1921719	I'm sorry, they're not the Beatles.
1922020	1926983	They're good bands in their own way, but I'm not as excited about that as the Beatles, whose songs have lasted forever.
1927023	1927223	Sorry.
1928551	1934137	They actually are also going to be doing a limited edition premium bundle for $250 on all platforms.
1934157	1941244	That would be Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii that will have instruments modeled after the ones that the band actually played.
1941885	1944228	So, hey, that might mean Hofner bass.
1945765	1947366	That's a little excessive for me.
1947566	1948006	I'd get it.
1948287	1953290	I wouldn't get it, but I can see where collectors and hardcore Beatles fans would be all over that crap.
1953330	1954771	So that's not a surprise.
1954851	1956032	I mean, for me, I just want the game.
1956272	1959734	But that's good for that audience, that they're doing something like that.
1961235	1962695	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1991889	1992969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2007125	2008146	Thanks for watching!
2027438	2033843	Did you hear a controversy on how people think that the Wii version is going to be $59.99 for just the software only?
2033863	2034323	They're like, $59.99?
2034363	2034724	What the hell?
2034804	2035444	Everything is only $50.
2035845	2036705	That is the cap for Wii games.
2036725	2036825	Not $59.99.
2036865	2036965	It's $49.99.
2037006	2037466	Says who?
2049895	2051116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2073917	2076720	All that aside, you know, $79.99 was a lot of money.
2076920	2079843	And it certainly was more money than you were seeing for other games at the time.
2079883	2081704	I believe a lot of Super Nintendo games at the time were going for the $49.59.
2082085	2086149	No, I think they were like $39 or $49 back then.
2086169	2088851	But I remember Street Fighter II especially was very expensive.
2088891	2089772	Maybe it was only $69.99.
2089852	2092154	I just remember it was much more expensive.
2092214	2093215	But it was Street Fighter II!
2094440	2096441	Who didn't want to buy that game back in that day?
2097441	2099182	I honestly don't think it's going to come out for $59.99.
2099282	2103024	I think that's actually a misprint, but whatever.
2103064	2113569	People are going to stick with it for now, and they'll have a big controversy, but I don't see a lot of people picking it up for $60 if that's the case, even if it is the Beatles, because who gives a shit?
2113669	2114390	It's the Beatles.
2115490	2116571	I know I'm not picking it up.
2116671	2118652	I don't give a shit about the Beatles, so whatever.
2120004	2122186	A couple chatters are correcting, saying it was $69.99.
2122567	2124549	I'm thinking like $70 in my mind.
2125109	2127292	Ranma says, Sky, at Toys R Us it was $69.
2127352	2130074	Local shops had it for $79, and GameGuru says it was $69.99.
2130935	2133137	Son of Dad said it was $69.99 at KB Toys.
2133177	2137342	I don't know how you guys remember that, or if you just looked it up on the internet real quick, but still...
2137822	2141065	Still, they don't charge $69.99 for games now.
2141205	2144267	I can't think of many games that aren't collector's editions that go for that price.
2144327	2153955	So, you know, I'm just saying, who's to say they can't charge whatever they want for the game if they know it's going to be in high demand and that people are willing to pay that for, you know, what is arguably going to be a premium game.
2153975	2160741	I mean, it's not like we're talking about, you know, Carnival Games 2 trying to command a price of $59.99.
2161801	2163983	We're talking about the frickin' Beatles.
2165544	2166845	So, you know, I don't know.
2167046	2167066	I...
2168642	2169643	I won't buy it for the Wii.
2170063	2172464	Why are you talking crap about Carnival Games 2?
2174005	2174486	I want to know.
2174686	2176006	I'm not talking crap.
2176067	2178168	I'm just saying I wouldn't pay $69.99 for it.
2178868	2181810	If Carnival Games 2, it's worth that kind of money.
2181970	2189514	Interesting comment from Marissa Congusto in the chat, and I know that's the lovely Marissa who hasn't been on our show in a long time, but I think she needs to grace us with her presence again sometimes.
2190535	2194117	True Beatles fans are more nuts about the music than gimmicks.
2194798	2195718	But people do get nuts.
2195778	2196699	Look at all the Elvis crap.
2197762	2226537	interesting perspective alright let's move on by the way the release date of this game 999 10 years after the release of the Dreamcast what a fun day to release stuff and I believe as I was hearing on a Bobby show earlier tonight one of their chatters said something Final Fantasy 8 was out on that same day too so September 9th is a fun day for releases 999 Final Fantasy 8 was out on that day too no I think it was out on September 9th of a different year it's not the same it's not quite the same
2228252	2231154	Anyways, so there's another rumor.
2232976	2234617	Honestly, this isn't actually a rumor.
2236019	2236579	I've seen it.
2237959	2244761	Activision is preparing to release Guitar Hero Van Halen later this year, August to be exact.
2245541	2259744	And it will be coming out, of course, with some of the more popular Van Halen tracks, Jump, Panama, Hot for Teacher, and also other bands' music are going to be in there, just like the Metallica stuff and Aerosmith.
2259824	2262245	How can you have Jump without keyboards?
2262685	2263105	How?
2263585	2265066	I don't get that.
2265186	2266607	How can you do that without keyboards?
2266927	2269808	I mean, I know, but I always thought of Jump as a keyboard song.
2269848	2271469	In fact, there's a local store in town.
2272029	2275131	I don't remember if it was Guitar Center or Skips or one of those stores.
2275891	2278773	You had the keyboards all on display at the store, right?
2279033	2282194	But they had these big songs that the following songs are banned.
2282234	2284635	Do not play them on these keyboards or we will kick you out of the store.
2284695	2285536	One of them was Jump.
2286076	2287077	You couldn't play the chorus.
2288237	2289618	Dude, like you couldn't play it.
2289638	2291879	Like that and Fur Elise and all the other stuff.
2291919	2294141	Like they would kick you out of the store if you played that.
2294361	2295342	That's hilarious.
2296923	2299224	It reminds me of that scene from Wayne's World.
2299244	2299724	No stairway.
2299964	2300725	Denied.
2300805	2301325	Exactly.
2301385	2302686	It totally reminded me of that.
2302866	2303587	No stairway.
2303767	2304227	Denied.
2306403	2307224	No Chopsticks.
2307285	2308847	I know Chopsticks had to be one of them.
2310149	2319464	Other stuff, other songs that might be in there as well, Juice Priest's Painkiller, Tenacious D's Master Exploder, which you might remember was from Rock Band 2, and Weezer's Dope Nose.
2321544	2325628	And of course, this is all to be taken as rumor right now, but no, it's not a rumor.
2325688	2326789	It's actually coming out.
2326909	2328711	It's going to be just like Guitar Hero Metallica.
2329351	2331593	So expect that later on this year.
2331673	2340181	However, that is not all that you can expect later on this year, because that's one of the millions of different Guitar Hero games that are coming out this year.
2340521	2342984	Well, actually, Hero games, including...
2344885	2365585	The previously announced Guitar Hero Modern Hits Also supposedly this year Guitar Hero 5 or whatever they're going to call it Band Hero, how that is any different than Guitar Hero 5 is beyond me Another Guitar Hero on Tour game for the DS and DJ Hero
2367028	2371556	I guess they weren't kidding when they were talking about the whole five Guitar Hero games in a year or something like that.
2372358	2374281	I think it's a little overkill if you ask me.
2375885	2405115	but I know I'm not buying any of these so except for DJ Hero maybe that's a maybe Marissa in chat again says it's true about Stairway try playing it in Guitar Center I don't doubt it I'm sure they would get very angry at having to hear that song it's just like I hear on American Idol certain songs are banned from the auditions too like you can't sing Alicia Keys Falling in your audition I don't know why I know that I must have read it on Wikipedia or something Robert M on the last story makes a funny about the release date of the Beatles rock band game the Beatles rock band release date number 9 number 9
2405775	2405975	Number 9.
2407176	2409277	It's kind of a real nerdy joke there.
2409718	2416702	It's also the same day as the 9 is released by Tim Burton, which looks awesome.
2417123	2418043	Is that a game or a movie?
2418644	2419964	It's going to be a movie and a game.
2420345	2420785	Oh, of course.
2421846	2422426	I had to ask.
2422466	2424387	Of course, if it's a big movie, it's going to be a game as well.
2424648	2427329	I thought the next Tim Burton movie was the Alice in Wonderland movie.
2427710	2428250	No, no.
2428270	2429431	The 9 is the next one.
2429751	2430151	Oh, okay.
2430531	2431632	Unless Alice in Wonderland.
2431652	2432913	I don't think Alice is coming out this year.
2433053	2433653	No, I think it's out in 2010.
2433733	2433834	Okay.
2434654	2436275	I love Alice in Wonderland and all that stuff.
2436295	2437897	I'm really excited about the new movie.
2438477	2440078	Anyway, more Guitar Hero.
2440118	2444221	And this is a follow-up to a story we reported on probably a few months ago at this point.
2444242	2447064	I'm sure our FUs of the Week came right after this particular story.
2447404	2450366	Do you remember when Gibson sued the makers of Guitar Hero?
2450666	2451087	That's right.
2451167	2454830	Gibson had sued over the whole patent they had on
2456432	2460158	Musicians simulating participation in a concert and all this stuff.
2460358	2462923	They tried to claim basically that they invented Guitar Hero.
2463283	2466448	Even though Guitar Hero worked with them to make the controllers or what have you.
2466789	2467790	Well, guess what?
2469238	2470679	It was lost.
2470839	2477342	Their patent suit was lost and essentially was practically laughed out of court is what happened with that.
2478503	2478843	Let's see.
2478943	2480204	This was from the U.S.
2480564	2482945	District Court for the Central District of California.
2483965	2484246	Let's see.
2484306	2488288	The court said it's toys that represent other items there.
2489108	2497752	Also, apparently Gibson's patent only originally applied to devices which use the analog audio signals, not MIDI signals or any other types of control signals.
2498253	2498393	So...
2499153	2499594	There it is.
2501195	2502116	Suck it, Gibson.
2502376	2507061	Yeah, it was a little bit silly of them in the first place, as we discussed previously.
2507141	2509643	But I guess you could say justice was served.
2510143	2512185	I guess you could say they hacked the Gibson.
2516189	2517530	Give me that.
2517931	2518732	Sad trombone.
2520559	2540185	Well, while we're on the subject of the guitar games, whatever, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits will be out in June and should have 48 songs including Them Bones by Alice in Chains, Killer Queen, Killing in the Name, Through the Fire and the Flames.
2541685	2547727	It's basically pulling songs from the other Guitar Hero games and putting them in one game.
2549392	2553953	I guess the only cool thing about this is that now they're going to get the band treatment.
2554153	2560395	Like I was reading somewhere that Through the Fire and the Flames is supposed to have crazy hard drums on it to match the crazy hard guitar part.
2560835	2561295	But still.
2561455	2562795	I want to play the vocals for that.
2564096	2573498	Still, if you listen carefully, listen carefully, and you might be able to hear the sounds of this franchise getting milked to death.
2574398	2575559	Because that's what's happening.
2575599	2576099	I mean, really.
2576119	2576979	It's a slurping noise.
2580054	2589465	The other day I was looking on iTunes, and they have greatest hits for Wilson Phillips.
2590967	2594511	Wilson Phillips had two big songs and two CDs.
2595032	2597655	Does this really necessitate a greatest hits album?
2598584	2600705	That's how I feel about this whole Guitar Hero thing.
2600965	2605407	Is there really enough out there that necessitates this Guitar Hero greatest hits album?
2605468	2606928	How about this for more milking, Rob?
2607108	2608369	It's going to be out on Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, and PS2.
2612550	2614911	All the Guitar Hero stuff is milked on all the systems.
2638908	2640008	Don't be like Konami.
2640949	2643070	Don't hoard DDR.
2643270	2645871	Again, at least bring a keyboard or something like that.
2645931	2651133	And Ranma says in chat, Sky, if Rick Astley can have a Greatest Hits album, so can Wilson Phillips.
2652349	2653429	Good statement, good statement.
2654050	2655750	That could possibly be the chat comment of the evening.
2655770	2656090	We'll see.
2656610	2659651	All right, let's get into some release dates from around the world, Loki.
2660132	2666174	All right, well, in the U.S., we have a few games coming out this week, starting off with stuff for the Wii.
2666694	2673456	We've got New Play Control Pikmin and New Play Control Mario Tennis, slightly old but yet new.
2674677	2681419	My Pet Shop for the Nintendo DS, which is being released by Taito, and features Mama from Cooking Mama.
2682119	2683681	Except now she's working in a pet shop.
2685503	2687385	Is there anything I don't want to know?
2688326	2689748	I need Mama to fix my life.
2690849	2691670	I don't know.
2692151	2694253	Maybe she's hunting for ingredients.
2695615	2697036	We need relationship, Mama.
2697096	2697737	That's what I need.
2697757	2699319	I need Mama to fix my dating life.
2699499	2700300	That's what I want.
2700340	2700861	No, I'm kidding.
2702856	2705177	EVE Online Special Edition coming out on PC.
2706197	2709578	World Championship Track and Field on the DS.
2710258	2713118	Animal Planet Emergency Vets for the DS.
2713419	2715319	Yet another pet fixing sim.
2716179	2716559	Literally.
2718040	2720820	My Sims Party on the DS and on the Wii.
2721320	2722061	Coming out this week.
2723061	2726742	Totally Spies, Totally Party on the Wii and on PS2.
2728718	2732840	Docomo, um, Docomo Dake Boing on DS.
2733420	2735681	It's a weird game with some giant mushroom, I don't know.
2735701	2736362	Can you say that again?
2736862	2738323	Docomo Dake Boing.
2738343	2746567	Uh, Trivial Pursuit coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.
2747507	2749248	Mad World on the Wii.
2749648	2750989	That game looks awesome.
2752230	2752690	Avalon Code DS, Zubo DS
2774850	2789026	SBK Superbike World Championship PS2, Xbox 360, PSP, PS3 My English Coach Spanish Edition
2796406	2800708	World in Conflict, the complete edition on PC coming out this week.
2802108	2803829	And a few more things here.
2803909	2808271	Vacation Sports on the Wii, another party game collection.
2808931	2813653	And finally, save the best for last, Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Xbox 360.
2813693	2816814	And speaking of Xbox 360, you can get your limited edition
2817874	2820677	Red, Xbox 360 Elite System.
2821718	2823740	Some praise for MadWorld in chat.
2823800	2825341	Lazy Days, MadWorld looks cool.
2825782	2827263	Deekman, can't wait for MadWorld.
2827363	2831087	So it's nice to see a Wii game getting some fanboy loving.
2831668	2832048	There you go.
2832501	2835763	It's got, okay, it's got John DiMaggio in it.
2835823	2837044	I mean, the voice of Bender.
2837384	2843208	And Greg Proops from Who's Line doing sports commentary while you murder people with a chainsaw.
2843768	2845089	What more do you want?
2845490	2846290	That's pretty amazing.
2846810	2848952	I randomly met Greg Proops like years ago.
2849392	2851954	It's nice to see that he's still doing it because, you know, he had that game show.
2851994	2853975	I met him like right around the time he had that game show going on.
2854395	2855956	And then that got canceled.
2855996	2857377	And then Who's Line wasn't on anymore.
2857417	2859359	So I'm really glad to see he's around still.
2859599	2860840	It's so awesome.
2860860	2861180	Yeah?
2861480	2862041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2883038	2886941	I actually found a lot of old photos that I'm actually sorting through and going to throw away the really bad ones.
2887001	2890603	But I just found my pictures that I took at a cemetery in Alabama.
2891964	2893585	There was one of you cosplaying as Emmy, though.
2893625	2894546	I thought that one was really cute.
2894906	2904313	This particular photo that I will go and put on the camera in a second is from the Church Street Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama of the only Revolutionary War veteran buried there.
2905513	2907014	So that means that he had to have enlisted when he was 15.
2909016	2912380	Lots of love for Greg Proops in our chat room, apparently.
2912520	2913261	He's awesome.
2913621	2915404	We should try to get him on the show or something.
2915424	2917766	Nah, I don't know about that.
2917806	2919909	That's like stretching the boundaries of, you know.
2919929	2920409	Why not?
2920790	2921270	Why not?
2921371	2923113	He's a voice actor in a video game.
2923273	2924374	Maybe he wants to sell the game.
2924434	2926617	If the game does well, they'll want him back for a sequel.
2929226	2929686	You never know!
2930266	2931127	Alright, anyway, forget it.
2931507	2933607	Let's move on to some Japanese release dates.
2933747	2940650	And coming out in Japan, of course, since we're getting it over here, you know Japan's going to be getting Resident Evil 5 over there.
2941310	2943290	Actually, I think that just came out this last week.
2943350	2944271	Yeah, it came out last week.
2945071	2949715	But they are getting, I know this is new, the Idolmaster Twins is new on the Xbox 360.
2949755	2952598	You know, Idolmaster is a pretty big franchise over there.
2952618	2953879	And now it's got twins.
2954840	2962227	So on the PlayStation 3, Army of Two gets a price reduction as it goes into EA's Best Hits collection, as does Need for Speed Pro Street.
2962628	2968293	But if you want to get some new games in Japan, Resistance 2 is actually new for Japan in some DualShock packs.
2969154	2970115	Musou Orochi...
2970675	2977180	Orochi Z is coming out from Koei this week as well over on the PlayStation 3 and Skate also getting a price reduction.
2978101	2988509	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, Phantom Brave Wii is coming out this week on March the 12th as is Sonic Tohankoku no Kishi comes out as well.
2988630	2991132	I'm not sure what this... Oh, this is Sonic and the Black Knight.
2991872	2992432	Over in Japan.
2993012	2995813	WeCheer gets its release in Japan this week as well.
2995833	2998314	Because I know you guys can't wait for WeCheer over there.
2998634	3003115	And Boku to Sim no Machi Party comes out as well from EA.
3003175	3004196	My Sim's Party.
3004516	3005396	Is this My Sim's Party?
3005536	3006336	Yeah.
3006396	3006697	That is.
3007017	3007377	That is.
3008637	3016685	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Galaxy Angel 2, Need for Speed Pro Street getting a reduction and that's it for the PlayStation 2 this week.
3017045	3024672	Let's look at the handhelds real quick on the Nintendo DS, Tokamiki Memorial, Girl's Side, First Love Plus comes out from Konami this week.
3024752	3027774	Also coming out from Konami, I'm sorry, a price reduction for Survival Kids.
3029436	3035161	Also coming out, Konami Dual Spirits, the DS game, actually that's another price reduction, I was going to say that game's been out a while.
3036101	3036842	Thanks for watching!
3056215	3068790	The End of Infinity Resistance Restribution also coming out on the PSP this week and that looks to be about it unless you're looking for a price reduction on Need for Speed Pro Street So that's it for the Japanese release dates
3070011	3074093	Well, how about some UK release dates as soon as I set my photos down?
3074314	3076475	Sure, let me read a quick chat comment while you're doing your photos.
3076755	3083379	Acidic Vampire in chat says, When I play Wii Cheer, I actually attach streamers to my Wiimote to make them feel like real pom-poms.
3083839	3084700	You joke!
3084900	3085260	Dork!
3085440	3089103	You joke, but they sell those things for the Wiis.
3090343	3092144	I was going to say, I'm surprised they don't sell those.
3092164	3093645	No, they do sell those.
3093665	3097748	They sell Wii pom-pom attachments for your damn remotes.
3098888	3101289	Yes, people are that retarded.
3101309	3104170	I kind of want one for some reason, but I'm cheap.
3104310	3106671	Well, remember, you can use it for every game.
3107211	3110833	Yeah, because I want to play Mad World with my pom-poms.
3110913	3111473	Yay!
3111553	3112373	Go cheer!
3112473	3112933	Woo!
3113054	3113674	Cut you in half.
3113714	3114474	That's hilarious.
3115254	3117595	I'll put this on the camera in a moment, or if you want to do it for me.
3117695	3117895	Sure.
3118256	3119696	This cat is 27 years old.
3119956	3120536	Oh my heck.
3120657	3121717	Alright, get to the release dates.
3123037	3123698	Let me give you the photo.
3124038	3124739	His name is Sean.
3125720	3126821	That's my cat from Alabama.
3127242	3131507	Anyway, coming out on... I think he's a zombie.
3133510	3136612	That's the only way we can explain that he's lived that long.
3136652	3138253	He's alive by the power of evil.
3139073	3142355	I've already said last week on the 8th and 9th that Flock was out.
3142936	3153442	The 10th, Tomb Raider, Underworld, Lara's Shadow on Xbox 360, Bleach, Dark Souls, Codename Panzer's Cold War on PC, Persona 4.
3154103	3155263	By the way, those last few were on the 13th.
3156404	3170449	Resident Evil 5 on the 13th Resistance Retribution, So Come Frontation, Sonic and the Black Knight, Tom Clancy's Hawks on PC Tiger Claw just linked in chat
3171934	3175255	Sorry, I just saw a picture of those stupid attachments.
3179696	3183637	Oh, God, I almost want them just for the sheer gayness of it.
3183777	3185618	I just I feel like I need to own it.
3185818	3190879	I don't know what it is, but I'm just compelled to purchase it, even though it only has a one and a half star rating.
3191259	3197701	Dude, $19.99 for two little pieces of plastic that you tape on to the ends of your Wiimotes.
3197741	3198461	That's amazing.
3198561	3202762	We finally got a skew for the Wii music instruments.
3203263	3208384	They have attachments for all those, too, so you can look like a douchebag playing those.
3208825	3210785	I want to point out, Amazon looks like they're having a sale.
3210845	3218108	You can get that and a Wii Cheer and All-Star Cheer Squad, all three together, $84.97 for the Ultimate Cheerleader.
3221271	3221832	Oh, God.
3221872	3222172	All right.
3222612	3223873	Sorry.
3224473	3228675	Anyways, there's going to be a new Pac-Man game on the way.
3229316	3232938	This is to celebrate the game's 30th anniversary.
3233598	3233998	Good Lord.
3234038	3238981	You know, I remember just a few years ago when we were at E3 when they were celebrating the 25th anniversary.
3239982	3242023	Now, of course, the 30th anniversary will become...
3242603	3246046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3267203	3285540	and I guess Yasuhara is part of it and says the new game design was sort of meeting his wish 100% so I have no idea what the hell that means but it's going to be a Pac-Man game so set your expectations low!
3286741	3288942	Well, I mean, the last Pac-Man game that came out was really awesome.
3289002	3290902	Pac-Man Championship Edition was pretty great.
3290942	3292503	Even Pac-Man Versus was pretty fun, too.
3292903	3295924	But, yeah, I mean, not every Pac-Man game has been a winner.
3296144	3296884	It's Pac-Man.
3296924	3302325	I mean, it's like, if Pac-Man ran faster, we'd be having the same problem as Sonic.
3304526	3304886	But, uh...
3306634	3308976	I'm kind of curious to see how they're going to reinvent Pac-Man.
3309136	3310256	There were Pac-Pix.
3310777	3311977	That seemed like a good idea.
3312478	3313218	I love Pac-Pix.
3313278	3315599	Until you played it, and then you're like, wow, this sucks.
3315659	3320262	Yeah, Pac-Pix, it was one of those things that was neat in a small dose.
3320302	3324524	It was a great demo to show the DS off with, but as a game...
3327657	3328697	I just found a picture of Jason
3351826	3352006	What?
3352447	3353467	Our webmaster, Jason?
3354028	3355029	How old are these pictures?
3355049	3355689	What are these all from?
3355729	3355789	E3.
3355809	3357210	You dig up.
3357971	3358812	Almost.
3358832	3359532	04, probably, right?
3359812	3360273	Yeah.
3360313	3361734	I found a really bad picture of us.
3362274	3362695	Oh, boy.
3363855	3364816	Oh, I remember that picture.
3364936	3365277	Blurry.
3365517	3365957	I look cute.
3366277	3366758	All right, hey.
3367518	3369160	Talking about pictures makes for great radio, doesn't it?
3369280	3369900	Yes, it does.
3369960	3370541	Hey, Konami.
3371360	3376163	You know our friends at Konami, they are turning 40 years old this week, if you can believe it.
3376183	3377244	You're over the hill!
3377704	3379525	Congratulations, Konami, you're old.
3379966	3385629	No, Konami has officially turned 40 this week, and quoting on the age of the company and how they did it,
3386750	3392294	President Kuno Nio says, Consistency plays a major part in everything Konami does.
3392374	3394796	I don't know if that means rehashing their games over and over.
3394836	3395357	No, I'm kidding.
3395777	3400160	Obviously, Konami's put out a lot of great games that we've loved very much over the years, so there you have it.
3400300	3404364	Konami also promises that there are a wealth of other new titles in development.
3404904	3412690	By the way, a game that I left out of my gaming week was the DDR on the iPhone was a game that I actually played this week, the brand new one.
3412710	3414431	They have DDR on iPhone now.
3415092	3415172	Um...
3415912	3419496	It's alright, you know, considering it's DDR on your iPhone.
3419536	3421038	I mean, you don't actually dance.
3421238	3422559	But here's the thing.
3422599	3429967	There's this new mode they have called Shake Mode where you actually play DDR by tilting your iPhone to the left and to the right and up and back.
3430007	3431549	You know, which is kind of stupid but cute.
3431869	3432930	But here's the weird thing.
3433050	3435934	You only can play the tutorial song in Shake Mode.
3436735	3437416	Is that a bug?
3437837	3438598	Seriously?
3438698	3440942	You were only meant to play the tutorial song and nothing else?
3441122	3447173	Did somebody forget to put that pointer in that says, Oh, after the tutorial, go back to the song select and not the main menu.
3447774	3448475	So, I don't know.
3449591	3452614	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3470749	3472929	It is a lot of newer DDR songs.
3472949	3475290	There's some old-ass stuff mixed in there.
3475590	3477070	But here's the thing that surprised me most.
3477350	3479671	Did you know Brilliant 2 U now has a vocal version?
3480711	3482111	It's kind of scary.
3482431	3483132	That's all I have to say.
3483552	3489493	I've been out of the DDR loop for so long, I had no idea there was a Brilliant 2 U now with vocals.
3489513	3490533	Is it Paul Terry singing?
3490933	3498975	Or is it that really awful dude that did that crappy rap that was in... It could very well be, for all I know.
3499505	3502414	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3507669	3510171	Get these kids off your damn lawn
3538961	3543725	I don't know, it's just... I can't be excited about this stuff anymore.
3543865	3547327	I will be more excited about DDR when there's something that's really reinvented it.
3547647	3552691	And, you know, I don't know, even just going to different... I have a way to do it, but no one wants to give me the money to do it.
3554192	3554452	I know.
3555152	3556373	Alright, let's move on.
3556413	3557274	Some more gaming news.
3557334	3560356	Enough reminiscing about the past 40 years of Konami.
3561136	3563338	But we like the past.
3563985	3564467	Yeah, that's true.
3564487	3568119	I think back to the Konami of the 80s, the old school Metal Gear game was amazing.
3568340	3568721	But anyway...
3569124	3573026	Well, how about some different news?
3573426	3582151	Ubisoft has actually pulled a game called I Am Alive that's being developed by Darkworks from their lineup.
3582191	3593317	They announced at E3 that they wanted to release it this spring, but it's actually been delayed until March 2010 because it's apparently such an ambitious title that they want to do it justice.
3594538	3596279	So let's hope so.
3596587	3597367	It was funny, though.
3597407	3598268	Actually, they announced it.
3598308	3599388	Yeah, it's coming out in March.
3599749	3603030	And then they're like, uh, yeah, about that.
3603070	3605191	It's actually financial year 2010.
3605311	3605812	Oopsie.
3607072	3610374	We jumped the gun there.
3610974	3612735	So sometime between now and March.
3614116	3614356	Sweet.
3615236	3615517	Anyways.
3617213	3619294	There's something else that's kind of interesting.
3619334	3623917	You remember we talked a little bit about it that Square Enix was starting to buy up some shares of Eidos.
3624478	3629121	Well, Square Enix is hoping to finish buying the rest of Eidos by May.
3629941	3637146	And they're actually expected to approve a deal with the Eidos shareholders later this month.
3638167	3644130	And hopefully by, I guess, May 6th, there will be...
3646525	3646985	I don't know.
3649468	3651469	I guess they'll be under the ownership of Square Enix.
3651870	3653031	That's kind of interesting, though.
3653671	3656353	Because my thoughts are, why would you want Eidos?
3656614	3658235	I mean, really, it's Eidos.
3660096	3661698	Well, they do own Tomb Raider, right?
3661718	3667142	So there's a new Tomb Raider movie coming out, so maybe they're going to try and do a different type of Tomb Raider game for it.
3668303	3668844	I don't know.
3669504	3671066	Maybe try to reboot some of the franchises.
3671106	3673668	Doesn't Eidos also have a Hitman that they have?
3673971	3674672	Square Eidox Square Eidox
3704944	3708887	Game Guru in chat says Square Enix wants franchises that aren't JRPGs.
3708947	3715231	And that could be, you know, there has been those stories about they want to get more into, you know, the more American style of the game development.
3715291	3715952	So why not?
3717668	3723509	Yeah, but I mean, this is about like half a step from, you know, buying out Atari or something.
3723570	3727511	I mean, no offense, it's just like, Eidos is not what they used to be.
3727591	3729591	Tomb Raider is definitely not what it used to be.
3729771	3735272	And, you know, their other franchises, you know, the ones that they still put out aren't what they used to be.
3735312	3736793	And they haven't been really that great.
3736993	3739754	Well, they obviously see something in it that maybe they can turn around.
3739774	3741154	Maybe that's why they're able to buy them out.
3741775	3742937	The shares are so low.
3743478	3743879	I don't know.
3743999	3745743	It's just whatever.
3745903	3752297	I mean, if you're square and you've got lots of money, then I guess it's fine to buy Eidos.
3754093	3764278	Well, hey, this game company seems to be doing something right, because apparently, according to Nintendo Power's recent issue, A Boy and His Blob is coming back on the Wii pretty soon.
3764739	3765379	That's kind of cool.
3765399	3768621	This is coming from WayForward, is the company that's making this game.
3768961	3772943	Now, you might remember, a little while ago, they were kind of testing this on the DS.
3773523	3777025	There was a DS version of the game that was under development, but then it ended up getting cancelled.
3777045	3779967	I remember playing this at E3, going like, wow, it's A Boy and His Blob.
3780287	3781387	But now, apparently...
3782828	3788191	It's going to be reinvented on the Wii, and there's more information in this month's Nintendo Power Magazine, so that could be interesting.
3788331	3789292	Remember A Boy and His Blob?
3789532	3789592	Yes.
3789612	3790372	It's kind of a neat game.
3790773	3796636	A little bit of a short game, but you know, back on the NES, it was kind of okay, because it took a long time to figure out how to beat it unless you had a cheat guide.
3797056	3798037	But this could be kind of cool.
3799437	3801238	I don't think it's a remake of the first game, though.
3801318	3803419	I think it's probably a whole new thing.
3803459	3805400	But it definitely was an interesting concept.
3805540	3809982	If you don't remember what A Boy and His Blob was, basically, it was kind of a puzzle game.
3810042	3823268	You had the blob, and you were the boy, and you could walk around, the little blob would follow you, and if you fed the blob different flavors of jelly beans, then the blob would turn into different objects, like the blob could turn into a ladder, the blob could turn into a trampoline, or a key.
3823668	3826910	It would just basically shapeshift all these different things, so you were kind of
3827190	3827730	Thanks for watching!
3849368	3851991	Hitstun in chat points out that WayForward also made Contra 4.
3853813	3855595	DarkTatooia asks about the brick wall trick.
3855655	3856476	No, I don't remember that.
3856516	3859820	I do seem to remember there was a really easy way you could cheat in Boy and His Blobs.
3859840	3862182	That must be what he's talking about.
3862222	3864105	Dan Shadow asks, is Jelly Belly paying for this?
3864165	3864425	I don't know.
3864445	3865586	It could be a good sponsorship.
3866127	3866808	I love Jelly Bellys.
3866988	3867849	No, they have Jelly Belly.
3868676	3869177	and DarkSakura.
3886119	3889642	Um, you know Jelly Belly doesn't make the Harry Potter beans anymore.
3890122	3895906	They, uh, I guess lost the licensing agreement with that, so now they have their own, like, sad flavor of jelly beans lined.
3895926	3899548	Like, have you ever had those nasty Jelly Bellys, like in the, you know, vomit flavor and all that stuff?
3899568	3900569	I don't know any Jelly Bellys.
3901459	3901799	DarkSakura.com
3926272	3927193	Here, look for yourself.
3927773	3928214	Okay.
3929314	3930095	Hold on, let's see.
3930756	3934398	Someone did a parody of what the Watchmen ending was going to be like.
3935219	3937501	Oh, is this going to spoil the actual movie because I haven't seen it yet?
3937521	3937841	No, Rob, it won't.
3939740	3940981	Candy Mountain.
3941661	3942002	Yeah.
3942602	3943603	That's fantastic.
3943623	3944503	Sorry, that's terrible radio.
3946024	3947485	It's basically, never mind.
3947505	3949067	At least our live listeners can look at that.
3949747	3953410	Anyway, how about some UK Virtual Console stuff?
3953910	3955071	And this makes me happy.
3955251	3956031	It's fun stuff.
3956692	3957913	It's Clu Clu Land.
3959114	3960274	We remember Clu Clu Land.
3960795	3961135	I do.
3961195	3963617	I remember playing Animal Crossing on the GameCube.
3964048	3968930	Yep, and I played it on the Nintendo when it was new, back in the day.
3969950	3975412	Basically, you just have to turn bubbles and make gems and stuff, and it's 500 Wii Points.
3975952	3980174	And then, Mega Drive title, Wonder Boy 3 Monster Lair.
3982015	3986016	So, which I think we got it was Wonder Boy Monster Land.
3986136	3989598	I think we just got that on Virtual Console ourselves over here, too.
3989618	3991758	Yeah, that's 800 Wii Points.
3992259	3993239	So, go get them!
3996222	3998504	Go get them!
3998524	4000386	280 games for the Virtual Console available now.
4001227	4004389	Yeah, and I'm not interested in any of them, unfortunately.
4004910	4005450	That's a lot.
4005911	4006952	Still no Guardian Legend.
4007072	4007712	You want to know what?
4008113	4009754	I probably have that many in the vault.
4011996	4012917	I wish I was joking.
4013317	4014739	No, I wouldn't doubt it.
4014759	4017681	It's just, you know, a lot of... I probably have that many ROMs.
4017761	4018162	No, I'm kidding.
4018242	4019683	You know kind of why I wish I was joking?
4020023	4020223	What?
4020243	4021685	Because we're sorting them all.
4022592	4024295	ExciteBots Trick Racing
4037745	4040908	And we actually got some details on it, other than just the name now.
4041828	4047433	We have pictures of the box art that came out, which looks interesting.
4047553	4050175	Which was promptly stolen and put all around the rest of the internet.
4050215	4052697	Yeah, because I don't give a shit, so whatever.
4053798	4057901	So anyways, yeah, box art which shows robotic animals and...
4059582	4061264	Yeah, with wheels and stuff.
4061284	4061804	That's kind of neat.
4062645	4068790	And another interesting stuff, and before I was kind of worried, the description made it sound like a party game and stuff.
4069090	4071633	It actually looks like Excite Truck, and it looks pretty sweet.
4072473	4081201	Although there is weird stuff in there, like there's a robotic turtle carrying a tambourine for some reason, and I'm not sure why.
4082722	4085064	And then there's some other stuff that I saw with, like...
4086513	4088195	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4102269	4104670	The game basically plays very similar to Excite Truck.
4104770	4106350	It's based on a star system.
4107350	4118032	You can get in first place, which obviously helps you, but if you don't get in first place, it doesn't really matter because it's all about who has the most star points at the end of the race.
4118173	4124514	You get points for doing different things like tree runs, catching air, doing air tricks, etc.
4125034	4153810	You know, jumps, whatnot So, very similar to Excite Truck The controls are going to be exactly the same And they've added a few different things in there as well Now they have these new, like, energy pulls That you can swing around and gain a boost off of that Lots of fun stuff And then there's also some other game modes in there as well Hopefully optional That you can play poker by driving through cards And then, you know, based on what you get You get points on, you know, the hands or something like that
4154230	4161226	and then also the clown thing which I don't know what how that plays but you basically throw a pie at a clown as you're driving around but um
4162532	4164193	Nonetheless, it looks interesting.
4164353	4167574	They've got vehicles flying through the air and stuff like that.
4167754	4172995	Plus, you get a power-up where your character is able to run with its legs and stuff.
4173055	4175676	Any word about internet play, like Mario Kart?
4176577	4181478	There was no word on that, but as I remember mentioning before, two to six players online.
4182218	4182598	Interesting.
4184199	4187800	And one to two players split-screen local.
4188000	4190101	Very, very interested in checking this out.
4191192	4192853	And the wife is extremely excited.
4192953	4195415	It looks interesting, but here's the thing about it.
4195655	4200758	Didn't we hear that this developer was working on something that was so secret they had to have the secret screens and all this stuff?
4200798	4208343	And I don't know if maybe somebody was just embellishing it or whatever, but I'm really thinking in the back of my mind, okay, is this game really that big of a deal that they had to keep it super top secret?
4209488	4210148	It looks good.
4210589	4212770	It really does look good compared to Excite Truck.
4212810	4214570	And actually, the graphics are a lot better.
4215831	4216131	I don't know.
4216191	4217632	I'm very interested to check it out.
4218092	4219933	I mean, they could have a really good game on their hands.
4220413	4224575	And, you know, I think the robotic lizard frog thing is kind of cool.
4224955	4227876	They're going to have a mouse in there they can play as, a robotic mouse.
4227916	4229137	But the turtle looks retarded.
4229197	4229657	I'm sorry.
4229697	4230938	He's got this retarded, like...
4231892	4233874	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4258616	4261258	So, you know, King Hippo, obviously we've seen in some screenshots.
4261358	4262839	Glass Joe, you know, is going to be in there.
4262919	4265681	Von Kaiser, apparently, is going to be making a comeback.
4266121	4270945	Not exactly one of the fighters I would have thought would be the best of the original, which started to make me fearful.
4271365	4275568	Because I think somebody said on this show a couple weeks ago, maybe this is just going to be a complete remake of the first game.
4275888	4276528	PUNCH OUT PUNCH OUT
4297643	4300525	Also, classic NES style controls.
4300905	4305408	If you flip your Wii remote on the side and play the game, you can play the game that way.
4305788	4309270	So that's kind of cool for those of us that don't want to flail our arms around everywhere.
4309551	4311412	You can still have some fun with Punch-Out!
4312132	4312593	So there you go.
4313533	4315014	Well, obviously Punch-Out!!
4315074	4322316	is a very classic video game, but we like to put the spotlight on a classic game every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I can tell you this week it's not Punch-Out!!
4322716	4327698	But it is some game that you should definitely be checking out, and it's DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
4327818	4329599	She's gonna dig through her archives.
4330635	4332656	DarkSakura, what is the classic video game of the week?
4350443	4352906	Characters from Madomonogatari.
4354208	4360755	So it's just a fun little game where you drop these bean-shaped thingies and have to match them up.
4360855	4365380	But you can do drops and make chain combos.
4365440	4367742	And I think it's been one of the...
4369684	4374950	I say blueprints for many other puzzle games to come out since.
4375290	4377072	Sort of like Puzzle Fighter, remember?
4377793	4379394	Where you had your chains and everything.
4380255	4385180	Basically, we got it at the USS Puyo Pop.
4386501	4392263	And we first saw it, though, as Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine for the Genesis Mega Drive.
4392283	4397624	It came out on Game Gear and Master System, but that version actually only came out in Europe and Brazil.
4398325	4408988	And then we got it as Kirby's Ghost Trap, which was the European SNES version, and Kirby's Avalanche, which was our version over here.
4411551	4436094	So, basically, the whole point of it is that you have to stack up, like I said, you have to stack up Puyo, and you have to match them up and get them in certain combos so that you can throw that many number of lines over on your enemy, who is also playing simultaneously with the enemy or the computer.
4436494	4445700	And they can block your moves by getting combos of their own, but basically whoever has a higher combo, then they get to sit over there.
4445720	4449083	It's actually called Rensa.
4450824	4453866	The chain of how they pop and fall is called Rensa.
4454647	4459110	So you can have any different kind of variety of it for how they fall.
4460430	4469415	Um, and the blocks that fall on the other side are called, um, Ojama, which, um, are garbage blocks, pretty much.
4470116	4472537	Um, or as we get them, they're new sets of Puyo.
4472897	4481802	So, uh, basically, like I said, the higher that you get, the, you know, the more that you drop on your opponent that they do not block, you know.
4482703	4482783	Um...
4485322	4488384	I'm sorry, this battle I'm watching on YouTube is quite epic.
4489125	4491227	My god, these players are amazing.
4491247	4493488	They're setting up chains left and right.
4493688	4498212	I have seen the 19 chain rob that someone managed to get.
4498892	4499793	That's pretty freaking epic.
4500093	4502155	And actually, this version of the music is from Puyo Puyo 2.
4503596	4505597	But I thought it was cool.
4505998	4508519	But basically, you've got a single P.O.
4508619	4513722	where basically you just fight the computer, and then you have the versus mode, which is double P.O.P.O.
4514523	4527211	You've got characters in the game, which we've seen a few of them in other games, because actually, Carbuncle made his way, made a brief appearance in Dr. Robotnik's B&B Machine, and it was called Has-Been in that game.
4527811	4544725	Um, but you have, um, uh, Arl, um, Naja, who is the main character, the blue girl with brown hair wearing a blue dress, and, um, you also, you know, also some of her, uh, chains, she calls out different spells because her character is apparently a sorceress.
4546246	4547886	Um, yep, and then you've got Carbuncle.
4548667	4549807	Carbuncle is cute.
4550367	4552567	And then, you know, for the first P.O.P.O.
4552607	4567110	you go through Skeleton T, Nasu Grave, Mummy, uh, Draco Centauros, um, Skadoldora, um, Skiapodes, um, Parpy, you know, you've got, you actually have Zombie too, which I think is cool.
4568110	4570711	And, um, my favorite name here is Zodamayo.
4571271	4572831	And your end boss is Satan.
4574877	4579602	So, and you have to fight him because, um, he likes Arl, but he really likes Carbuckle.
4581364	4594057	Um, as far as other versions that have come out, like I said, we've had the US ones, um, that was, uh, Dr. Robotnik's B&B Machine, Kirby's Avalanche, um, there, uh,
4596067	4603838	They actually say that the Puyo were supposed to be like how the slimes were in Dragon Quest.
4603898	4609926	They're actually from that RPG game Mago Monogatari, which if anyone's played it, I'd love to know.
4610026	4610326	I haven't.
4610987	4626855	But anyway, as other games came out, there was the Neo Geo Pocket, Neo Geo Pocket Color one, so we've had Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, we've had Puyo Pop over here in Japan, it was Mina de Puyo Puyo, which means Everybody Puyo Puyo.
4627875	4640186	Um, we've had Puyo Puyo Sun, which there's actually a Nintendo 64 version, Puyo Puyo Sun 64, and a Saturn version, and Puyo Puyon, which was, um, pretty much the second one.
4640526	4644470	We also had Puyo Puyo Fever, um, which we got as Puyo Puyo Pop Fever.
4645611	4651056	Um, that was on, uh, actually that was the last game that was released for Dreamcast.
4653450	4668839	Xbox, PlayStation 2, GBA, GameCube, DS, PSP, Mac, Windows, Pocket PC, Palm, DS, etc.
4668919	4674882	I actually have the TurboGrafx version at home.
4674982	4676863	They made this game on every damn system, basically.
4677103	4680365	Yeah, and you know there was actually a music game sequel...
4681345	4681825	Yeah, I remember.
4681845	4683007	I think you showed it to me once.
4683047	4683807	Yeah, you showed it to me once.
4683827	4685329	It's called Puyo Da.
4685529	4687551	It wasn't the greatest, but it was... I thought it was cute.
4687611	4688672	Yeah, it was different.
4688812	4690033	It's a fun little game.
4690113	4690573	It was different.
4690874	4696319	With Puyo Da, it's like you have to hit the buttons at the right time, sort of like a Parappa-ish thing.
4696939	4702284	But depending on how many you get right and how many they get right, you get more points than they get bombed.
4702604	4705047	So it's an interesting little spinoff.
4706809	4708230	Alright, well that's going to do it.
4708450	4708750	Is that it?
4708950	4716233	This had the line in there, though, that I know that it's not what she's saying, but it's like the game Psychic Storm.
4716373	4718754	You translate the line the same way as I get pissed off.
4720754	4723916	My husband's crazy.
4724856	4727637	Alright, I believe that is going to do it for your Classic Game of the Week.
4727677	4729538	I hope he's listening because I picked this for him.
4730111	4731732	Puyo Puyo Puyo Puyo Puyo
4750004	4767170	and also I would say if you want to get like a recent version of Puyo Puyo check out the Sonic Genesis collection because it has you know Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine which granted isn't a pure quote unquote version of Puyo Puyo but you get at least the gist of the game itself and you know it's part of that big collection so
4767810	4768371	There you go!
4768751	4769932	There it is, your classic game of the week.
4769972	4770473	Puyo Puyo.
4770753	4777320	We're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back with plenty more in Part B. We're going to talk about other companies getting into used game businesses.
4777360	4778061	This should be interesting.
4778101	4779322	And other game rental methods.
4779703	4781665	And some classic fighting games.
4781865	4784508	Kind of some more 2D fighters in the wake of Street Fighter 4.
4784548	4789053	We're going to be talking about some of that coming up next here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4789133	4789914	Stay tuned!
4796018	4803582	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 8th of 2009, where we are taping live on allgames.com.
4804123	4812607	www.allgames.com is the radio network that we are a part of, or if you want to check out our show specifically, you can check out www.orangeloungeradio.com.
4812647	4814228	You really should, though, check out both.
4814589	4818511	You know, you get a lot of time to surf the internet, I'm sure, so you should check both sites out because they're both great.
4819071	4822013	All right, we've been talking a lot about the latest and greatest in gaming.
4822033	4822674	We're not done yet.
4822694	4823694	We've got plenty more.
4824035	4826316	Let's talk a little more business now, Loki.
4826816	4828418	Yes, let's talk business.
4829418	4834161	Toys R Us is actually going to try to get into the used game business.
4834602	4838164	They're going to start doing trade-ins, I guess.
4839425	4845930	Apparently, an in-store advertisement, which was snapped by one of the CheapAssGamer fans,
4846590	4847891	Thanks for watching!
4861578	4867563	Apparently, you'll be able to return your games for, I guess, Jeffrey Bucks, maybe?
4867783	4868324	I'm not sure.
4868844	4871446	I'm sure it'll be kind of similar to the other... That means like a gift certificate, right?
4871487	4872387	Yes, yes.
4872467	4877512	Jeffrey the Giraffe Dollars, which, you know, have no currency whatsoever in...
4877952	4878452	The Real World.
4878933	4889901	But yes, you will be able to sell your used games back and receive store credits and no word on any pricing tiers or whether they're going to be competitive or not.
4890241	4894865	But hey, another option for trading in your used games is always welcome.
4896314	4900256	Although, to be honest, man, the last time I went to the Toys R Us, it was sad.
4900616	4905738	Like, half the store was converted into a Baby's R Us, and that was really sad.
4906218	4907979	Well, if that's what sells, you know.
4908580	4909460	I don't give a crap about it.
4909480	4911501	I remember the Toys R Us was the shit when I was a kid.
4911521	4911981	It was!
4912001	4912881	It was amazing.
4913022	4914162	It was so amazing.
4914922	4917804	But, you know, now they have Baby's R Us in there.
4919004	4920545	Well, you know, if it sells, it sells, right?
4922187	4937498	I just remember back in the day, they used to have the Atari 2600 thing set up, you could play the old school games on there But it's cutting into my LEGO aisle Maybe that's because they have a LEGO store at the mall Wait, what mall?
4937578	4939560	Arden Mall, they have a full LEGO store now
4940745	4941366	Are you shitting me?
4941446	4942186	I am not shitting you.
4942206	4943247	Oh, I gotta go!
4944648	4945589	That's so awesome!
4945609	4947251	It's apparently like a chain of stores now.
4947531	4947891	Good!
4948352	4949313	We need a Lego store.
4949333	4951174	They can get rid of the Apple store anytime, though.
4951655	4952956	But Lego store is awesome.
4953036	4955778	I did not know you had such a fan boner for Legos.
4955998	4957500	I have 10 gallons of Legos.
4957800	4959882	I measure my Legos in volume now.
4960883	4961523	Oh my god.
4961844	4966328	Between her video game vault and your Legos, I feel like I need something.
4966388	4967108	You know what I do have?
4967249	4969150	I have a full dresser drawer.
4969591	4971993	Full dresser drawer full of Pez dispensers.
4972473	4972994	I do have that.
4973114	4973394	I know.
4973414	4974315	I guess that's my thing.
4974355	4974655	I don't know.
4975674	4976094	Thanks for watching!
4992942	4994903	No, I've seen those for sale, though.
4995123	4996963	I kind of quit Pez collecting for a little while.
4997023	4999324	Something I did in high school and for a little while after that.
4999384	5006347	But the nice thing is, since I stopped for so long, now I have a lot of old Pez dispensers that have just been sitting in a desk drawer, not getting any sunlight or anything.
5007307	5012569	They're in good condition, I'm sure, but it's not that I'm in the buying and selling business of Pez dispensers.
5014465	5019188	You don't want to be one of those dudes on the Food Network during Unwrapped or something.
5019228	5025333	I watched one last night and they were talking about some guy that collected Mr. Peanut stuff and he doesn't even like peanuts.
5025673	5029196	He's just a douchebag that collects Mr. Peanut crap.
5029396	5030097	It's like, really?
5032136	5033117	Thanks for watching!
5049389	5071950	so whatever anyway I don't know how we got from video games to Hello Kitty but we can go back to talking about used games a little bit you know what's interesting is that Toys R Us is kind of in cahoots with Amazon so to kind of hear this you know because if you go to Amazon.com their toy section is all Toys R Us well Amazon.com is also running a trade-in program which would make sense if Toys R Us is doing this because they kind of have a little working agreement or whatever's going on
5073131	5075132	What you do, you can actually trade in games.
5075152	5076834	You select games on their website apparently.
5076854	5078255	They have to be in good condition.
5078575	5080197	You send in a shipment or whatever.
5080437	5084260	You print a shipping label on your computer and you can actually send these games in.
5084580	5090045	And they will actually send you an Amazon.com gift card for however much the games were worth.
5090885	5091806	Which is kind of interesting.
5092927	5095549	Now this is something apparently I think is just being tested right now.
5095569	5097431	I don't think it's actually starting just yet.
5097831	5098892	But yeah.
5100319	5100559	I don't know.
5124153	5124794	Thanks for watching!
5146588	5147849	Oh yeah, and they also sell books.
5148809	5151951	Actdeft in chat, chat.orangelaundryday.com says, Rob sounds excited.
5152011	5152411	I don't know.
5152652	5153292	I mean, I don't know.
5153352	5155393	I don't really, I don't ever sell games back.
5155433	5156294	I probably should.
5156754	5157434	I have a lot.
5157494	5159796	Speaking of which, I brought back your Test Drive Unlimited.
5159876	5162537	I realized I had it sitting on my shelf collecting dust.
5162557	5163698	I had no idea you even had it.
5163758	5164038	Well, that's...
5164338	5168001	Great, I'll plug that in and try it this week or something, but yeah, I don't know.
5168041	5173705	DarkTatooine in chat says, Sky, really, the only thing GameStop has over these is when you trade in a game, you can get a new one right away.
5174145	5178928	Amazon, you'll have to wait for shipping, and that is a good counterpoint, because yeah, I don't like to wait for shipping and all this stuff.
5179208	5181050	I don't even like Netflix, because it's too slow.
5182871	5184672	When I want to watch a movie, I want to watch it now.
5184872	5189255	Like, that's why, so I like Netflix Instant Queues, but let's face it, not everything is available on the Instant Queue.
5190056	5190156	So.
5192167	5195912	DJ Ranma S in chat says, now at GameStop you get the same amount if it's cash or credit.
5196012	5196773	That must be a new thing.
5197855	5199157	I don't know about that.
5199177	5200779	It could be a promotion or something they're running right now.
5201219	5202381	It didn't used to be that way.
5202541	5207087	That seems kind of fishy because I'd be getting cash every time.
5207808	5209750	Why now do you think that they're getting into this?
5209950	5211551	Do you think it's just the state of the economy?
5211591	5215674	There's more of a demand for used games because $60 is a really high price point to get games?
5216014	5216354	I don't know.
5216614	5219216	Probably it's a big margin item.
5219276	5222218	I mean, it's a business that has a good margin on it.
5223399	5224680	Why not try to get into it?
5224720	5230084	I mean, because Amazon's a powerful name and online merchants and...
5231661	5235904	If they can put together a really valuable system that people want to check out.
5236104	5243889	Because I remember reading the trading values for some of these games, and they were a few bucks higher than GameStop, but you've got to wait a little bit longer.
5244329	5244549	True.
5245830	5249693	If you want to go that route, I guess you could, if you're kind of patient.
5249933	5252915	I might look up some of my games and see if they're worth anything in the background.
5253035	5254356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5280057	5284538	Sometimes we do, but we just sell back the newer crap, like sports games and shit.
5284818	5285118	I see.
5285638	5287538	So, I don't know, is this something that interests you at all?
5287578	5291979	I mean, let's assume hypothetically your husband didn't manage direct competition of this whole thing.
5291999	5294239	Do you think this Amazon.com thing is something that would be interesting?
5295800	5296500	I don't think so.
5296580	5297960	He works at a video game store.
5298660	5302721	We just take them back to his store and trade them in for games at his store.
5303081	5307302	Right, but let's say hypothetically he didn't have that, because not everybody has a husband that does that.
5307482	5307642	No?
5308482	5308722	All right.
5309698	5312420	Any more you want to add to this, DarkSakura?
5313620	5314601	Good idea in theory.
5314961	5328429	I think Chegg.com started the trend actually for doing it online for having school books that you could rent and then trade in your old school books online to them and then get credit for stuff for your next semester's school books.
5328996	5329516	Thank you for watching!
5349545	5364119	Well, in other news, speaking of GameStop, they've actually dropped 13% in their stock value ever since Amazon announced their little trade-in deal.
5367655	5377023	They actually ended the day on Thursday trading in at $3.54, lower than it had before.
5378645	5386672	So it looks like their investors are actually getting kind of worried about Amazon's little plan, even though GameStop themselves aren't.
5387393	5391836	And looking at this, it's a fairly significant drop from what it was.
5392257	5392437	Yeah.
5399108	5406316	Gamefly Gamefly is testing out this brand new kiosk called the G-Box.
5406796	5413403	It's a game rental kiosk that I believe is going to be spotted at Texas Tech University.
5413983	5416065	They're probably going to be launching this soon.
5417113	5419855	Probably on a limited basis right now to check it out.
5420916	5432945	It will allow you to rent games for $2.49 a day for Xbox 360 and PS3 and $1.99 a day for Wii.
5433025	5437308	It's going to have new titles and they're going to carry them for a short period of time.
5439810	5442352	No word yet if this is going to tie into...
5444193	5445433	and DarkSakura.com.
5469741	5470221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5490367	5509526	Yeah, it could be interesting, which is weird, because I always thought those kiosks were kind of dumb, the ones I see at Walmart and stuff with the DVDs, but I have Netflix, I have Instant Netflix, I have other ways to access movies, but then I think about this whole concept for games, and I'm kind of like, well, you know, if Walmart right by my house had a box like this, I might be tempted to rent games, rather than just...
5511147	5512127	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5528453	5532657	For a longer period of time, obviously, but if you want to do it by night, it's all about convenience.
5532677	5537641	Because once something like this takes off, then you're going to see a lot more of these people doing it.
5537761	5542606	And I bet you anything, if Gamefly has good success with this, you'll probably see Redbox doing it.
5542926	5546469	They'll probably just have some sort of hybrid kiosk where you can rent games and movies.
5546930	5552935	And trust me, companies like that have thought about doing it, and they've tested it in some markets.
5553396	5554396	But the problem is, though, is...
5555017	5555617	Thanks for watching!
5573550	5574691	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5595124	5599926	It's basically Netflix, but it's Blockbuster stuff, and you can trade in the store.
5600026	5602027	So that way they get around the whole shipping thing.
5602287	5605169	If you don't want to wait for shipping, you can trade in the store, which I think is really cool.
5605569	5610511	But the thing that Netflix has on them is that Netflix has the streaming, and Blockbuster doesn't.
5610871	5616234	If Blockbuster teamed up with PS3 or something, I would leave Netflix and go to Blockbuster.
5616354	5619075	You know, that was one of the rumors floating around.
5619155	5619515	I know.
5621036	5622056	That would be pretty big.
5622256	5623077	And the thing, I mean...
5624076	5624917	Thank you for watching!
5639815	5640275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5656305	5665631	Because, you know, if we're sitting here, Loki and I, talking about, you know, maybe we'll stop making these $60 impulse buys if we could just rent the game for $2.50 out of one of these kiosks.
5665991	5671455	In the long run, is this going to be a good thing for the gaming industry, or is this setting up the gaming industry to get shot in the foot?
5672217	5674498	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5689764	5697491	However, though, on, you know, kind of the DVD movie side, not everyone is on board with the whole kiosk things.
5697571	5704577	In fact, there's a deal going on right now with Universal where all their product is basically banned from Redbox kiosks.
5704617	5709501	They will not sell to Redbox, and they will fine anybody that sells to them.
5709801	5712624	And basically, you know, ruining sort of deals that have gone on.
5713044	5713204	So...
5713985	5721830	Redbox, the people that run those, have to go out and actually purchase movies from a big box retailer and then put them in their kiosk.
5722171	5723531	But they can't purchase them directly.
5723872	5731056	They think that it's affecting their sell-through business by having these Redbox kiosks.
5731877	5734819	Really, when you look at the facts, though, that's not really the case.
5735239	5737381	It's not really having a large impact on it, but
5738462	5739444	and DarkSakura.
5753322	5753843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5772034	5774315	All right, let's look at other great comments from chat.
5774335	5774895	Thank you, chatters.
5774975	5781176	BreastLol, no, this was the same thing as blockbuster-ready games that Nintendo got all pissy back in the late 80s, early 90s.
5781856	5786637	AcidicVampire, it's a great thing because people will still buy the game if they like it, especially gamers.
5787197	5791838	DJRamaS, this could force the gaming industry to lower the price of the PlayStation 3 360 games.
5792338	5795339	ActDeft, sounds interesting, but I really don't know if it'll work or not.
5795879	5799080	Xlink, it can be a pro because you can try to see if you want to buy the game.
5799620	5800281	GameStop doing rentals.
5800341	5801864	I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet.
5813755	5816737	Son of Dad, it might bring down game prices for retail as a whole.
5817058	5819980	I would buy a used game from a Redbox for $25 if it was available.
5820600	5826565	SuperDude in chat says, wouldn't it be great if you could just stream new releases games like you do with Netflix on Xbox Live?
5827106	5828547	I bet you something like that is coming.
5828947	5835252	There's those rumors going around that the PSP 2, or whatever they're going to call it, new PSP, is going to not have a UMD slot.
5835272	5836894	I think we had a story on that a couple weeks ago.
5837514	5839656	Imagine if you could only download games.
5840276	5841737	I don't use my UMD slot.
5843818	5845619	It's a little different for you, but you know what I'm saying.
5846559	5849861	You kind of are seeing this shift towards digital distribution.
5850521	5866146	I seem to remember, we've been doing this show long enough now, I seem to remember in the last generation when the PS2 was new and all this stuff was new when we first started our show, there was talk that this round of systems we're in now was going to be all digital distribution.
5866566	5871688	And certainly with things like Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, there's a gigantic foot in the door
5872697	5873078	DarkSakura,
5889276	5896222	I would think maybe something like that is coming where you could stream games like that, but I don't think it's going to be the retail games.
5896282	5903289	It's going to be a long time before you see the retail games buy into that, but certainly digital distribution has...
5904310	5905071	games all its own.
5905171	5906112	Sony's on board with it.
5906152	5912658	I mean, they're doing their first party games available for PSP as digital downloads at the same time as release.
5913478	5921185	And they've kind of tested the waters a little bit with Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Warhawk, Burnout Paradise.
5922526	5924928	So, if they can find a way that
5925629	5926110	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5942105	5947431	We're going to move on to another story, but if you want to give your comments on this, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
5947451	5948071	Send us an email.
5948091	5951755	Especially, I really want to hear from, and I know we have a few that listen to this show.
5952176	5954378	I want to hear from the people that work for the developers and publishers.
5954498	5955940	What do you think about these boxes?
5956020	5957621	What do you see as the impact to your business?
5957741	5958883	I want to kind of hear from those guys.
5959203	5961666	If you need to stay anonymous for whatever reason, then put it in your email.
5961686	5962747	We'll be happy to stay anonymous.
5962787	5963407	Right, Dark Sakura?
5963588	5963948	You would be.
5964088	5964929	Just say it right up front.
5965069	5972931	Yep, so, and yeah, because I would really like to hear from that side of things because I don't think we have anybody working or in the chat tonight.
5973471	5977512	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about maybe games that you might rent through these kiosks someday.
5978132	5981173	Arc System Works, they are the folks that put together Guilty Gear.
5981613	5984454	They are doing a new high-def 2D fighter.
5984494	5986774	The game is called BlazBlue or BlazBlue.
5986814	5990215	I don't know how exactly you pronounce that because there's no E. It's BlazBlue, I would imagine.
5990575	5991256	Xbox 360 and PS3 Story Mode
6007106	6009349	Some individual stories for each characters and so on.
6010370	6013213	30 hours of gameplay, according to the director, Toshimichi Mori.
6014234	6025727	Also, there's going to be, of course, online support, which you can expect in this current generation of games, and download content as well, although they haven't said, is that just going to be outfits, new characters, moves, backgrounds, whatever.
6027509	6028129	Thanks for watching!
6052257	6054961	ShadowCharlie in chat says, yeah, I played BlazBlue in Chinatown.
6054981	6055422	What'd you think?
6055802	6056143	I'm curious.
6056163	6059047	I had not heard of this game before tonight, seeing that news bit.
6059287	6061030	They showed it off a while ago.
6061691	6062652	It looks pretty sweet.
6062972	6065976	It's all hand-drawn, 100,000 animations per character.
6068302	6069563	Dan Shadow Street Fighter IV
6086448	6087128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6108076	6108596	12 years, maybe?
6108616	6118044	Well, it's actually the first HD version that's going to be from SNK Playmore.
6118064	6120766	It's supposed to be on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
6121347	6128753	It has 20 playable characters, and they're all freshly redrawn, and the backgrounds are all new and pretty.
6129693	6133757	and, uh, supposed to really kick a bunch of ass.
6134137	6142303	Um, there's supposed to be, um, preview footage and images, um, included with the PS2 release of, uh, King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match.
6142603	6145005	So, let us know if you see him.
6146586	6147307	Mai's in it, right?
6147347	6148008	That's all I want to know.
6148048	6149949	Well, of course, her and her boobs.
6150349	6150690	Oh, right.
6150990	6151350	That's right.
6151370	6151931	Me bouncy.
6153166	6153646	That's all I need.
6179031	6192576	Program or update to their program that bypasses the anti-piracy features in a lot of these games and apparently now works on all the current games that feature some sort of anti-piracy lockout.
6195697	6197158	Yeah, there's no way to spin that.
6197178	6198618	That's only for piracy.
6198758	6205941	So I guess if you're interested in pirating games, the Cyclo DS is the way to go for now.
6206761	6208122	But interesting though.
6211288	6212989	Is this something we should really be encouraging?
6214169	6214329	No.
6214890	6224135	But it's one of those things that, you know, and one reason I like to report on this on the show, as I know we all do, is, you know, it's out there, so you can't deny its existence.
6224475	6231179	So it's kind of interesting to see what that scene does to always compensate for what the developers of the systems do and back and forth.
6231679	6231899	Yeah.
6233901	6234121	All right.
6236007	6239329	Talkin' a little bit about Metal Gear Online.
6239389	6240810	Kind of movin' over a little bit.
6241010	6242952	It's a new expansion coming out on St.
6242972	6244433	Patrick's Day, March 17th.
6244493	6246995	It's Metal Gear Online Scene Expansion.
6247515	6249756	Three brand new maps coming to the game.
6249977	6252438	Two new characters are gonna be coming as well.
6252858	6256601	Raiden and Vamp, apparently, are the new characters that you're gonna see in the Metal Gear Online.
6257362	6265047	Also some new special gear, which I think is kind of funny because now you can apparently wear a bikini if you want, or you can dress yourself up in clown face or whatever.
6265547	6269129	or you can wear the head of Robbie the Rabbit if you want to be extra creepy.
6269190	6270390	That would be from Silent Hill.
6270851	6271471	So there you go.
6271531	6273512	Or if you just want to encourage people to shoot you, I don't know.
6274633	6277935	Also, there's going to be a brand new game type introduced to Metal Gear Online.
6278396	6280837	It's free if you get the pack or not.
6281197	6282578	It's Solo Capture.
6282678	6287001	It's just like Team Capture, but you're by yourself because it's Solo Capture.
6287742	6293105	This expansion will cost you $9.99 if you want to get all the costumes and the characters and all that stuff.
6294186	6294286	Yep.
6295466	6299407	Pre-order start on the 10th and there's some screenshots floating around the internet there.
6300308	6306169	Some other items, you can get a visor for write-in and some special actions, etc.
6307490	6313791	I don't know anyone that plays Metal Gear Online, but I bet it has a pretty rabid community because I can't think of many games like it.
6315292	6316072	So, there you go.
6317672	6319233	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
6320256	6321357	Cat Toys Controllers
6340606	6343508	They have one that's a Guitar Hero controller.
6344209	6351355	They have a Wiimote, a Game Boy, an old school Game Boy, like the brick.
6351995	6356699	They have a 360 controller and a NES controller.
6357360	6361083	And they look like they're made out of felt and they are for the kitties.
6361823	6363024	They're so cute.
6363044	6367448	I was going to say, and above all, they're just cute, adorable for the little kitties.
6367468	6369590	I have to show this picture to the chat room.
6370072	6371293	Might Shermie be getting one of these?
6371714	6371894	No.
6371914	6374356	She don't play with any of the shit I buy her.
6374397	6374777	Grinch.
6375017	6375938	You know what she plays with?
6376158	6376358	What?
6376839	6377980	She plays with twist ties.
6379942	6380182	Nice.
6380943	6381964	How about your kitty, Loki?
6382044	6383706	I know you got a kitty a couple years ago.
6383786	6384246	Is this something?
6384727	6386088	Something that my cat would play with?
6386288	6389131	No, she'd probably look at it and go, I don't think so.
6389932	6391434	Does she still play with that stick?
6393914	6395295	Oh, like the feather and stuff?
6395375	6396296	Yeah, she loves the feather.
6396816	6404183	No, her thing right now, what she's been doing, she likes it when we make her tents or little forts on the couch.
6404223	6410388	Every time we go to bed now, we build her a fort using the blankets on the couch, and she loves that.
6410808	6415572	She's really easy to entertain.
6415672	6419415	She likes the milk rings, the little rings on the milk cartons.
6420336	6423237	Yeah, she has like 90 of them in the house.
6423537	6426238	She dumps them all in her food and water for some reason.
6426298	6427118	I'm not sure why.
6428319	6429319	But, I don't know.
6430519	6431399	She's making tea.
6431860	6433020	Making plastic tea.
6433540	6434100	I guess.
6434240	6437561	I always say Shermie puts her food in her water bowl because she wants tea.
6437942	6438882	I want a kitty.
6439042	6441263	I don't have any cute kitty stories like you guys do.
6441283	6442283	I want a kitty.
6442543	6444804	The roommate doesn't want a kitty though, so I'll have to wait.
6445044	6445844	But, someday.
6447688	6448728	Oh, well.
6449388	6460371	Now, not necessarily something for a cat, but the PlayStation Network, Sony is, I guess, trying to make this more like the virtual console.
6460911	6471454	Now, the rumor is, I guess, that they're going to try to put more non-PS1 titles on the PlayStation Network.
6472114	6473295	No word on exactly...
6475239	6477001	What systems are you talking about?
6477421	6478782	It's got to be arcade games.
6478942	6479363	It's got to be.
6479383	6480484	Just through process of elimination.
6480584	6482245	They can't put Nintendo games on there.
6482886	6486189	It would be pointless to then put Sega games on there now that they have that collection out.
6486669	6491073	Maybe they could strike a deal for TurboGrafx games or something, but I'm thinking arcade games.
6491093	6493475	We have Mortal Kombat 2 on PlayStation Network, right?
6493956	6495377	So I'm thinking arcade games.
6496311	6504355	Yeah, basically they're promising more PS1 titles and also more pre-PS1 retro titles.
6504755	6506496	So I'm guessing those will be the arcade games.
6507036	6508116	You can't really play...
6509750	6513133	Games like Mortal Kombat over the PSP thing, right?
6513273	6518718	Because I remember Mortal Kombat 2 was one of the first games that came out on PlayStation Network, but you can play it on PS3, but you can't play that on PSP, can you?
6519319	6520800	It doesn't have that whole functionality, does it?
6520900	6524204	You can't play multiplayer over Wi-Fi or anything like that.
6524284	6528027	The emulator that it uses to run those doesn't work that way.
6528167	6529609	Can you even download it to the...
6530089	6534053	Yeah, any PlayStation 1 games that are on the PS3 can be played on the PSP.
6534153	6535815	I don't know if Mortal Kombat 2 counts, though.
6535835	6538578	I'm talking specifically that one, because it wasn't a PlayStation 1 port.
6538598	6542842	That might have been an Xbox, or not an Xbox, like a PlayStation Network game.
6543022	6543823	Yeah, I think it was.
6544464	6548307	But if it's a PS1 classic title, then yes, that can be ported over.
6548468	6550149	If I would get a memory card for my PSP.
6550510	6551871	I could play Suikoden on the go.
6552492	6552952	But anyhow...
6554773	6557935	Jail Adults Who Allow Their Kids To Play Video Games That Are Violent
6579901	6584282	Yeah, this is according to Chief Censor Bill Hastings from New Zealand.
6584782	6587263	They might think the offense is silly, but it ain't.
6588203	6601847	Apparently, if you were to, let's say, let your kid play a violent video game, you know, shoot him up, blow some hookers in Grand Theft Auto, whatever, apparently, if you were the parent and you let your kid play this game, you could face up to three months in prison or a $10,000 fine.
6602247	6604908	This law is set up to send a message.
6607109	6607189	Um...
6608388	6610609	How about just let people raise their children?
6611029	6611629	The way they want?
6611949	6615249	Because when I read something like that, I'm like, a big brother is watching you.
6615309	6616270	How are they going to catch you?
6616990	6620670	Are they going to be watching me in my house or rely on people tattling on other people?
6620730	6621751	This doesn't make sense at all.
6621931	6624351	Dan and I had a conversation about this earlier today, actually.
6624511	6624731	Really?
6625031	6633393	That we actually wouldn't mind if our kids played violent games as long as we balanced it and had talks to them and everything.
6634153	6638456	GS68 in chat says, Parents, not government, should be in charge of what their kids play.
6638476	6640417	I think a very well-rounded statement.
6641337	6641437	Yep.
6658500	6659181	Interesting, though.
6659261	6661981	So you would probably let your kids play violent video games.
6662061	6662422	I don't know.
6662482	6663402	I'd probably play it with them.
6664242	6664602	Well, no.
6665002	6666023	I would play it with them.
6667223	6668003	Yeah, yeah.
6668103	6670524	In the right context, I think it would be all right.
6670544	6674845	I'm trying to think about myself because maybe someday I'll have a kid somehow or whatever.
6675025	6681387	But I don't know if – part of me says if you don't let them play it, they're going to find a way to do it.
6681507	6681947	And you're right.
6681988	6686849	If you're not the one playing it with them, then they might not get it in the right context, if that makes sense.
6686889	6699115	Well, on top of that, and this goes true for just about anybody, child, adult, whatever, the things that people are not allowed to do tend to be the things that they want to do just because they're not allowed to.
6699515	6700075	Do you know what I mean?
6702259	6703280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6723357	6729342	Well, you know, the same sort of logic applies to just about anything that people are told they can't do.
6729742	6735787	Like, okay, for example, let's actually use the recent Prop 8 crap.
6736327	6737788	You know, people are told they can't do something.
6737828	6738248	What happens?
6738269	6740050	People come out and force and protest it, right?
6741722	6746787	You know, and people, you know, they get it done while they can or find other ways to get it done.
6746827	6749990	I mean, that's what I'm saying is that it's there, you know what I mean?
6750671	6754514	Whenever someone says you can't do something, spite is a very big part of human nature.
6755075	6760500	That indignation that someone has the audacity to tell you you can't do something, you know?
6760961	6762623	Ever since we're little kids, don't you agree, Rob?
6763365	6771430	Oh yeah, and it's funny because sometimes for laughs I'll go read, specifically you're talking about Prop 8, which obviously is an issue I'm quite passionate about.
6771470	6773371	If you don't know why, you need to listen to the show more.
6773891	6778754	But here's the thing, I'll sometimes follow it on one of the local news sites where people can comment on it.
6778774	6782156	A lot of comments I see are, you guys report on this issue too much.
6782196	6784617	It seems like every day you're reporting on some protest.
6785158	6787379	That's because people are not going to shut up.
6787919	6788480	My point was...
6798453	6799794	I know, I'm sorry, I got on a tangent.
6800034	6808542	But no, that actually has to go with what I was saying is that you tell people they can't do something and that's going to rise up indignation.
6808602	6811044	People don't want to be controlled.
6811104	6814246	People don't want to be told no.
6815708	6825075	The reason why I'm comparing something as strong as a civil rights movement to something as arbitrary as food is that it all comes from the same...
6826136	6827358	Well, now food is a necessity.
6838288	6839128	Don't be gay, Sparky.
6839148	6839448	Don't be gay.
6857768	6864473	or, you know, why do you think little kids think it's so awesome to go and sneak around and do stuff behind their parents' back?
6865214	6867536	Because they know their parents are going to make a big deal out of it.
6867576	6868897	It's part of its attention, too.
6869577	6877103	Or, you know, why is it that people get, you know, let's rate this very R, why do people get turned on doing it in places that they know they're not supposed to?
6878507	6882909	Seriously, like the couple who was doing the... Whoa!
6883329	6889771	No, for real, there was a contest that was going around about, you know, who could do it in what area, and there were like points you'd get for touching.
6889871	6891552	Oh, wasn't that a big radio contest?
6891612	6891872	It was.
6891992	6894373	That was the Opie and Anthony thing that got them kicked off the air, right?
6894413	6896114	Where they had sex in a church or something?
6896174	6897074	Yeah, yeah, I remember that.
6897114	6900235	But why would it be such a big deal if they weren't allowed to do it?
6900255	6902256	Because you're not supposed to have sex in a house of God.
6902296	6902776	Exactly.
6904117	6906998	When you're yelling, oh God, oh God, that's not praying.
6907882	6915665	So, really, where would the allure be of a kid sneaking around behind his parents' back if there's no harm in it?
6915705	6918666	If the parents are going to be like, okay.
6920327	6921347	Do you see what my logic is?
6921468	6922508	No, I get it.
6922568	6924009	I'm going to be like that with my kid.
6924069	6929231	I mean, it's not that I'm going to, you know, I'm going to teach them the right and wrong, but video games are video games.
6930231	6935293	My whole plan is to teach them the difference between reality and unreality.
6935913	6937214	And I also don't care if they curse.
6938305	6942107	Alright, obviously this is soliciting a huge response from chat.
6942167	6944788	I want to read some of the chat comments we have here.
6945749	6950231	GameGuru says, I'll allow my kid to play any game but have talks if it's rated for older people.
6951271	6953372	SuperDude says, no flour for my kids.
6954633	6957374	Can't play a game as tame as flour.
6957955	6960336	SSJ100Matt says, Jamie will teach your kids to play pinball.
6961327	6962388	Hell fuck yeah!
6962408	6964711	And all the lyrics to Pinball Wizard.
6964731	6966533	No, I want to play good games with my kids.
6966553	6969997	GameGuru says, Government is full of idiots and I don't want idiots to raise kids.
6984612	7001745	Deekman has an interesting plan in chat chat.orangelunchradio.com live on Sunday night says when my girl gets older I plan on setting up an NES in her room and only letting her play NES games for two months then SNES for two months and so on so she gets an appreciation for classics
7005008	7009710	Maybe I also have this expectation that my child will be like me and my husband were and not be stupid.
7011051	7014512	Because I watched all kinds of crap and played all kinds of crap.
7014552	7021154	And as long as the difference was... I don't think a five-year-old should play Silent Hill.
7022195	7022395	Right.
7022995	7026937	But what five-year-old is going to be interested in Silent Hill?
7027217	7027397	Right.
7028709	7037694	But like, you know, when I was, for example, I don't look at it any different as me being allowed to read the books I was allowed to read as a child.
7038475	7047200	You know, the Scarlet Letter had to do with, you know, a woman conceiving an illegitimate child by having an affair.
7048081	7049422	How old were we when we read this?
7050712	7054494	How about the Grapes of Wrath dealing with the depression?
7054514	7055834	That's certainly an adult theme.
7056254	7060456	I read Atlas Shrugged when I was in 9th grade.
7060596	7062577	That actually deals with a lot of sex.
7063137	7067679	Catcher in the Rye is like the Quinta Shenshul sophomore year of high school book, right?
7068119	7068699	I never read it.
7070370	7075052	I read the Odyssey when I was in middle school.
7075152	7077613	I read the Inferno when I was in middle school.
7078893	7083475	But I look at it, it's got to be down to the parent's judgment.
7083975	7087796	I look at it the same way as, yeah, they're classic books, whatever people.
7088317	7094439	But the situations dealt with are for a different level of intellect and maturity.
7095359	7104924	And certainly, if I don't detect the level of maturity that I think is going to be able to handle that, then I'm not going to be the one to introduce it to them.
7105204	7105704	You know what I mean?
7106825	7114089	If it comes out that, yeah, I was at my friend's house and I saw this thing, then I'll be like, okay, well, let's have a talk.
7114189	7115269	You know, that's not real, right?
7115429	7116170	Okay, don't do that.
7117507	7118488	Let's get some chat comments.
7118508	7119349	This is a great discussion.
7119550	7121412	Bress Lowell says, Jamie read Playboy too.
7121532	7122072	I don't know about that.
7122473	7123374	For the articles though, right?
7123954	7126878	Bochikawa in chat says, Catcher in the Rye is like 6th grade now.
7128134	7128934	They grow up so fast.
7129354	7133755	Dan Shadow says, you know, with all these rainbows and unicorns, five-year-olds will really be into Diablo 3.
7134536	7134896	Possibly.
7135856	7137576	All right, some more serious comments in chat.
7138857	7148399	Death Wishing says, I personally think it's good to show kids M-rated games because it shows like Grand Theft Auto because it shows them that if they do something wrong, they get fucked by the police.
7149915	7150776	I don't know about that.
7151676	7156159	And what people are taking out of context is that... There was an XD after that, so I think there was a little tongue-in-cheek.
7156219	7164083	But I also think that what some people are taking out of context is that I'm not going to take a five-year-old, like I said, and play Silent Hill with them.
7165224	7167906	A lot of it is parents' discretion.
7168826	7174770	And, you know, like when my little sister... Okay, when my little sister was little, little...
7175330	7176271	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7193091	7195713	Um, there's, there's a difference.
7195893	7201216	You know, you just have to trust sometimes that the kids are smarter than you give them credit for.
7201557	7211243	And I actually had this discussion with Dan's stepmother, and I'm not going to go into too detail, but I was like, we can't expect the government to do a parent's job for them.
7211643	7216646	The parent's responsibility is to that child until they are of age and can leave.
7219417	7222061	A person is a parent before conception.
7223143	7223944	That's how I see it.
7225509	7228470	A couple last comments from chat here and then we'll try to go ahead and move on for tonight.
7228630	7231590	This has been a good discussion and I'm sure we'll probably get some emails about this one.
7231630	7231990	Can't wait.
7232750	7238512	SuperDude in chat says, If kids can get their hands into R-rated movies, it's not that hard for them to get the M-rated games either.
7238632	7242972	Kids will always find a way to get the M-rated games because they know M-rated games are the shit.
7243933	7249354	DeathWishing in chat, last comment here I'm going to read, I play video games and I haven't killed anything except ants.
7249874	7250414	Fucking ants.
7252554	7254756	When I was 12 I found my mom's college level human sexuality book.
7254876	7258359	Only damage it did was give me some very happy boyfriends later in life.
7276621	7281431	Alright, look, we gotta make some time here since we did just read about a really ludicrous story.
7281812	7287064	Obviously these types of stories put us into a fit of rage and it's a part of the show that we like to call the FUs of the Week.
7302671	7306554	My first FU goes to people making assumptions.
7308475	7321224	This is directed towards certain people in my house who will not name names of.
7322765	7328049	And also I'd actually have to direct that towards myself too because I've made a couple of assumptions too, so...
7329189	7358063	my second I was about to say my second assumption I meant my second F you actually has to do with semis trying to do U-turns and intersections too small for them and my third one has to do with the Watchmen movie it should have been a fucking miniseries not a movie it's not means I didn't like it I just meant the story would have been better told through a miniseries you just wanted more of it
7359446	7360787	I wanted it better paced.
7361988	7362628	I'll put it that way.
7362808	7363909	It needed better pacing.
7365230	7365510	All right.
7365711	7367392	I don't really have a lot of FUs.
7367432	7371034	I guess FU to Daylight Savings Time because that really screwed up my weekend.
7371655	7374917	Otherwise, just an FU to the fact that I'm flying to Washington, D.C.
7374957	7376518	this week and I'm only going to be there for a day.
7377219	7378560	I'm flying there on Tuesday.
7378580	7379340	I'm going to be there Wednesday.
7379360	7380341	I'm flying back on Thursday.
7380381	7383223	So FU to not getting to spend quality time in a faraway town.
7383823	7384084	Loki.
7384904	7387406	FU to Cobblestones because they suck to walk on.
7387895	7389456	The Round and Awkward.
7389476	7392539	The Round and Awkward.
7393660	7394120	Fair enough.
7394140	7396162	That's going to do it for the FUs of the Week.
7397083	7400946	A segment we've done for the past many, many years here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7400966	7402107	Let's get back into some gaming news.
7402488	7408933	We do have the mailbag coming up and the Skype line soon enough as well where we'll be taking your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR but not just yet.
7408973	7410294	We'll let you know when the phones are open.
7410574	7412896	We do still have some more stories we want to get to though before then.
7412956	7413317	Right, Jamie?
7413677	7415339	Yes, and this one's about Penny Arcade.
7416139	7425287	Washington State has passed a bill which is pretty much like damn you guys rock to the Penny Arcade founders Jerry Hulkins and Mike Krahulik.
7425527	7436637	But basically they were honored for their contribution to their state's industry because there are about 48 video game companies in Washington state.
7437357	7446644	And also they run a really, really excellent charity, The Child's Play, which has raised over $4.5 million for children's hospitals.
7447445	7448065	So very good.
7449686	7453329	And, you know, they also bring people to the state, like Penny Arcade Expo does.
7454249	7458472	Yeah, and, you know, just obviously, yeah, Penny Arcade Expo is probably a huge economy boost for the state, you know.
7458713	7461395	Especially for the restaurants and the bars.
7461915	7462275	Mm-hmm.
7462315	7463276	They're very happy about that.
7464622	7484966	Well, you may remember me talking about Eat Lead, The Return of Matt Hazard, a game that came out a couple weeks ago, actually last week, and kind of was a parody on the old video game genre and everything from old shareware games and RPGs and that kind of stuff.
7485327	7491668	Well, now they have a new Flash game that you can try out that actually recreates one of these fictional games
7492328	7494970	in the history of Matt Hazard.
7495931	7502755	And the game, of course, is Matt Hazard in Land Extreme Alpha Advance.
7503616	7508539	And it's a game you can check out at MattHazardExtreme.com.
7508920	7511962	Kind of a parody of a 16-bit game.
7512782	7518006	And they have a nice photo of Matt Hazard destroying what looks like a robotic Pegasus.
7520388	7520648	Huh.
7521918	7525259	Dan Shadow in chat says, Matt Hazard is not good, quite simply.
7526959	7528420	Were you a fan of Eat Lead eventually?
7528480	7531101	It was okay.
7531221	7532221	It wasn't great.
7533061	7538623	The game itself is funny, but the way it plays is kind of crap.
7538823	7544685	It was a good idea on paper, and then they tried to make it, and it just wasn't working.
7545705	7546145	It didn't work.
7546886	7547287	ApoCrippa?
7565508	7565989	AppleCrippa?
7566309	7567650	I don't know how exactly you say that.
7567710	7568371	Apocrippa.
7568971	7569852	Apocrippa.
7570313	7571193	I don't know how you say that.
7571534	7577159	But that is the expansion that's coming out this week, and apparently it's going to kind of change some things about the game.
7577559	7586287	If you're a new player in the game, you get some new epic mission arcs that are going to help guide you through the different factions in the EVE Online game, and so this means it's going to be a little more new player-friendly.
7586607	7589529	Probably to address some of those things that EVE Online is too damn difficult.
7589869	7593592	I've heard a lot of people have gotten into this game and they get blown away because I guess the whole thing is PvP.
7593932	7594732	So this will kind of help.
7594973	7604519	But if you're a veteran player and you want to get into this game, there will be some new wormholes that are going to show up in the game and you'll get some new enemies and some new items and things of that nature.
7605219	7608922	The enemies will now change their tactics based on your performance.
7609202	7615847	They might even call in backup, change some targets, use debuffs, whatever they're going to have to do to blow you up.
7616747	7620971	So check out that EVE Online expansion for Apocrypha.
7621511	7623413	A-P-O-C-R-Y-P-H-A.
7625114	7625755	Apocrypha.
7625815	7626876	That sounds right, Apocrypha.
7628017	7628417	There you go.
7629518	7630779	EVE Online, coming out soon.
7630959	7633822	Coming up right now, the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.
7633882	7636944	Every week you guys send us your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7637245	7640387	We pick a few of our favorites and read them live here on the show.
7640508	7642649	So DarkSakura, why don't you dive into the mailbag?
7643479	7647580	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Pick out some emails and read them for us right now.
7648881	7649641	Oh, do I gotta?
7650481	7650981	Yes, you do.
7651622	7652742	Okay.
7652822	7658544	First email is... Hello to everyone at the Orange Lounge, including random guests.
7658584	7662185	If there is one this week, that would just be Harvey, who is invisible.
7663085	7665006	Or Pikachu, if you're watching Justin TV.
7665026	7668567	We do have Pikachu, and he's armed with a sword tonight, which Loki's kind of sitting in front of us.
7668587	7669767	He can't really see, but he does have a sword.
7669787	7670707	That's Pimpin' Pikachu.
7670727	7672368	That's right, with his pimp hat tonight.
7674043	7678625	The other week you were talking about British telly and stuff that isn't worth watching on the BBC.
7679125	7684648	If you can access the BBC iPlayer, please, please, please make some time to watch a phenomenal new series called Being Human.
7685108	7687969	It's about a vampire werewolf and a ghost that share a house in Bristol.
7688589	7690570	It really is the best thing on TV at the moment.
7690990	7694712	It was MasterChef, but that's finished now.
7695852	7697213	I would love to know your thoughts.
7697533	7701655	I feel like I should inject something game-related here, so here's my gaming week slash month.
7702595	7703076	C.O.D.
7703096	7705498	World at War on the Wii, as Tony the Tiger says.
7705618	7706399	It's great.
7706859	7708601	Not sure if Tony the Tiger owns a Wii, though.
7708921	7709502	I'm going now.
7709682	7709962	Bye.
7710342	7712805	Love from Chard, age 23 and a half.
7712905	7713765	No, wait, I'm nearly 33.
7714466	7715527	Fuck, where did that come from?
7716828	7718269	That is what the email said, by the way.
7719711	7720492	Which was beautiful.
7722586	7724668	Wow, the next one's big.
7725149	7726270	Thank you, Spousinator.
7727651	7728592	Hi, folks.
7728712	7730974	If you three didn't mind, I have a few questions for you.
7731434	7739282	First of all, as of right now, I'm trying to change up how my 360 Elite is hooked up to my TV, mainly for convenience sake more than anything.
7739742	7741164	However, I'm running into issues.
7741304	7752317	Right now, it's hooked up to my 32-inch 1080i HD TV via component cables, but I'd like to be hooked up by HDMI and passing through an HDMI switch on its way to my TV.
7752998	7755321	As nearly as I can tell, it should be a no-brainer.
7756122	7756362	All this...
7758023	7760825	The seating seems correct, and it's just a matter of swapping cables.
7761165	7764908	However, every time I do attempt to switch my TV, it tells me it's receiving an invalid signal.
7765608	7768790	I read the 360's instructions, and it seems like I'm doing everything right.
7768930	7770811	Am I overlooking something obvious here?
7771211	7773733	Before you say it, I know I won't see an improvement in picture.
7774313	7781098	I'd just like the convenience of using my HDMI switch to switch between my cable box PS3 and PS3.
7782278	7782959	You said PS3 twice.
7785427	7786527	Anyone care to tackle that?
7786667	7788248	I ran out for just a minute.
7788668	7789968	What was the heart of the question?
7789988	7791569	Because I wanted to get a refill on my coffee.
7791589	7793309	Something about not getting the right picture?
7793569	7800011	He wants to hook up his Xbox 360 Elite through the HDMI switch, but it's getting invalid signal.
7805133	7805673	I'm not sure.
7805753	7808414	This might be a question better left for a Best Buy employee.
7808474	7809594	Do you have any thoughts, Loki?
7809614	7809714	Okay.
7810478	7810878	I'm not sure.
7811279	7813160	You should just hook it up and it should work.
7813240	7814722	Yeah, it should just kind of work.
7814782	7820366	Right now it's hooked up to my 32-inch HDTV via component cables, but I want it to be hooked up by HDMI.
7821467	7822648	But it should be a no-brainer.
7822668	7823849	Yeah, it should be a no-brainer.
7823869	7826992	Every time I do attempt it, my Switch TV says I'm getting an invalid signal.
7827352	7828153	Try new cables.
7828513	7830975	Yeah, it's got to be the Switch, the cable.
7831515	7832656	Something weird's going on there.
7832676	7833057	You're right.
7833157	7834018	It should be a no-brainer.
7834058	7834818	It ought to just work.
7835038	7836960	I think you probably thought of everything I might think of.
7837060	7839042	Should just be able to plug it in and go.
7840082	7843665	Some thoughts from our chat room, because of course when we can't think of the answer, usually our chatters can.
7844005	7846507	The Irish Gangster says, Microsoft wants you to buy a new cable.
7847427	7850269	Acidic Vampire says, you might have to use a Microsoft HDMI cable.
7850309	7851130	Nah, it doesn't matter.
7851330	7855292	It's just an HDMI cable, but it sounds like, I don't know, some issue there.
7855312	7858274	If you've got cheap cables, though, then that might be the problem.
7859615	7860816	We actually pretty much use them.
7860916	7863037	I think we pretty much stick with the Monster cables at my house.
7863057	7863217	Yeah.
7867480	7873205	I don't know if you've used that HDMI cable on anything else and maybe I've had issues.
7873345	7878869	It might be just poor shielded or something and for some reason it's getting the wrong signal to it.
7878929	7890458	There's another thing you can do maybe with it hooked up where you can reset your video settings on it and you might try that maybe booting up with the HDMI cable.
7890478	7891179	I think you hold...
7892469	7897593	I want to say it's either the right shoulder button or the right trigger and why, while you're booting up the system.
7897693	7900895	I'm sure if you look on GameFAQs or something like that, it should say how to do it.
7901135	7904358	One of them will reset the video, the other will format your hard drive, so be careful.
7904418	7906279	No, one will not format your hard drive.
7906579	7907620	That's something different.
7908661	7909421	That's a reset.
7910142	7912263	There's another one to reset your cache also.
7914084	7917507	Yeah, I think it's the shoulder button or the right trigger.
7917787	7919128	It's one of those and why.
7919408	7920209	Oh, is the little...
7920865	7921165	DarkSakura
7936786	7942669	SSJ100 Matt suggested he update it because they just updated the HDMI on Xbox Live.
7943729	7947171	Acidic Vampire says, I tried a generic cable and it didn't work, but it works on my PlayStation 3.
7948112	7949833	Dan Shadow says, don't buy monsters.
7950893	7954795	SSJ100 Matt says, I got an HDMI cable for less than a dollar and it works great.
7955195	7957877	Tony Tony Tony suggests switch to HDMI input.
7958977	7963000	CableWholesale.com, that's a good place to check for cables on HDMI.
7963200	7964741	I think this might be the best advice yet.
7965081	7967343	TigerClaw suggests maybe it's a handshake issue.
7967403	7973927	The HDMI switch must support HDCP, so maybe the switch is not good enough.
7974288	7974988	That's a good thought.
7975768	7980612	And then lastly, another thing to test, SSJ100Matt says, try plugging the HDMI cable directly into the TV.
7981572	7987376	And then a recruit who has not changed their name suggests they need to make sure their 360 is configured correctly.
7987437	7989778	So, wow, that's like a million different options.
7990239	7991339	Hope it works out for you, buddy.
7991399	7992160	Let us know what happens.
7992600	7993181	Sorry to Jamie.
7993501	7994001	Next part.
7994361	8004209	Additionally, in regards to last week's story about the lesbian that got banned from Xbox Live after reporting being harassed by others, I have a bit of an odd nagging question, which honestly I'm surprised no one else has asked.
8005362	8016951	Not to suggest in any way, shape, or form that Microsoft or the bullies were right, they obviously weren't by a long shot, but what exactly is the point of putting one's orientation on one's online profile on either Xbox Live or PSN?
8017832	8033965	Granted, I'm still fairly new to the whole Xbox Live scene and all, but as nearly as I can tell, the bio section of Xbox Live Profile is geared to inputting info about yourself that's gaming or gamer lifestyle related, such as what systems you own, what game genre players
8035046	8036752	How long one has been gaming, etc.
8037775	8041265	I don't see how one's orientation, regardless of what it is, has anything to do with gaming.
8041506	8041767	True.
8043317	8058947	As I stated on the show last year, the one where there was the talk about the so-called offensive retooling of space invaders for the art slash commentary purposes, I'm all for the First Amendment rights regardless of whether or not others are offended, but somehow talk of one's orientation in Xbox Live seems a bit out of place.
8059528	8068134	Although it's not perfect, the only analogy that comes to mind at the moment would be like going to an AA meeting and talking about all things Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
8068714	8072717	As with the analogy, AA meetings are for dealing with alcoholic issues, not TMNT.
8073737	8077339	and as nearly as I figure BIOS and Xbox Live profile are meant to be gaming related.
8078980	8080161	Am I missing something here?
8080461	8082422	Am I way off the mark or missing the point here?
8084043	8087705	I do hope that she gets her profile back and that she's not turned off from online gaming.
8088746	8093929	Frankly, even though there are a-holes online, gaming on Xbox Live or PSN can be a lot of fun.
8096161	8098663	I like to stab kittens in the face.
8098963	8099443	She's a lesbian.
8121858	8127323	I wonder though if I Love the Stab Kittens in the Face would be considered offensive and if that would get banned.
8127363	8128124	You probably would.
8128204	8128885	I wouldn't try it.
8129565	8132328	But I mean, if that's what she really wants to put in her profile...
8133783	8134544	Who am I to judge?
8134564	8136325	How many people actually read their profiles?
8136345	8136426	What?
8157318	8158459	Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
8158519	8158879	Get ready.
8158899	8160160	Only the old school gamers.
8160180	8160520	The Sega fans.
8160540	8161761	You know what it's from.
8161841	8162462	Oh, completely off topic.
8162482	8163923	I actually found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone.
8179670	8180070	Congrats.
8180891	8181292	You're a winner.
8181752	8182013	I am.
8182313	8182533	All right.
8182573	8185437	So anyway, I, you know, and, and somebody else has said, uh, what is it?
8185497	8189401	Ponzi scheme in chat says, I listened to the interview on Major Nelson's podcast.
8189441	8191523	Microsoft is being ultra PC with this issue.
8192144	8194607	Of course, of course they have to be ultra PC with this issue.
8194647	8199072	They don't want to get, they don't want to get the pink mafia sick on them, which I completely understand.
8199532	8205716	You know, and obviously I think they realize this situation has been blown completely out of proportion.
8205776	8206536	Thank you, Internet.
8206636	8208537	But it's something that needs to be addressed.
8208697	8211499	So it'll be interesting to see what happens as a result.
8212359	8212639	All right.
8212739	8212940	Ready?
8213500	8213700	Mm-hmm.
8214060	8215441	Next email.
8216401	8216682	I'm sorry.
8216702	8218983	I have to say this one other comment from Ponzi Schema Chat.
8219383	8221304	I like Olive Garden's never-ending pasta.
8221344	8222365	Will I get banned for that?
8223485	8224526	No, but you might get fat.
8225807	8226347	Or diarrhea.
8227242	8232709	Hey OLR Crew, I've listened to your show for the past three years or so and I thought it would be nice to give you some thanks.
8233190	8238316	Thank you for helping me get through my customer service job, for entertaining me on long bus rides, and for keeping me sane.
8238716	8243983	Your podcast was the first one I ever listened to and it's one that I look forward to listening to every week.
8244884	8246566	There's another reason why I'm sending this email.
8246786	8251011	You see, I am sick and tired of people sending emails with crappy punctuation, grammar, and spelling.
8251371	8252533	Laziness is no excuse.
8253133	8257538	I thought it would be nice for DarkSakura to finally get a well-written, nearly error-free email for once.
8258419	8263885	In addition, just for the sake of proof of concept, this email is written from my iPod Touch with autocorrect turned off.
8264266	8266208	So you see people, it can be done.
8267717	8268177	I love you.
8269418	8271059	Alright, I'm stepping off my soapbox.
8271099	8273460	Maybe one day I'll email you with something video game related.
8273701	8275161	But that will have to wait for another day.
8275362	8276002	Midnight Skies.
8276502	8278483	This presentation of Grammar Nazi has concluded.
8278523	8280965	We now return you to your Orange Lounge Radio already in progress.
8282386	8283807	Actually, I've found no errors.
8285047	8285848	It was beautiful.
8286228	8287028	What do you want, a cookie?
8287068	8287709	Fanfare!
8289410	8293032	Oh god, don't make me dig up the soundboard.
8293312	8294693	Oh, well you were already doing it.
8296294	8299416	Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Midnight Skies.
8299476	8308820	And, okay, and I think it was Sauce that pointed this out to me before, but I tend to read the emails like they're sent to me, including, you know, bad grammar, run-on sentences and all.
8310081	8318745	So, you can tell from the fluid way in which this email was read that it was properly phrased and properly punctuated, that it didn't make my heart hurt.
8319206	8320986	Okay, what's the emailer's name, Midnight Skies?
8321027	8321467	Midnight Skies.
8321507	8323468	Midnight Skies, congratulations!
8331061	8331702	You get a cookie.
8332502	8333744	This email is getting saved.
8333804	8335946	Never delete it or I'll stab a kitten in the face.
8338168	8339689	Alright, any more emails?
8340630	8341110	Next!
8341771	8348257	This is an inquiry email via OrangeZonesRadio.com from, oh dude, we have that cool thing set up, don't we?
8349418	8349598	What?
8349969	8351770	I guess this is through the website.
8352010	8352350	Oh, anyway.
8352970	8355431	This is me just going... Okay.
8355771	8358652	Hey there, OLR... It's from Irene.
8358812	8360992	Let's just do the rest of the radio show.
8361012	8363233	That was my tribute to Irene, the fart princess.
8364913	8366114	Hey there, OLR crew.
8366174	8367754	This be Lexo and yo.
8368574	8368995	Or Leoxen?
8369095	8369655	Laoxen?
8370745	8371465	I think it's Leo Shen.
8371485	8373086	That's what I've always said.
8374147	8379370	First of all, I'd like to say that OLR has got to be my favorite video game show of all time.
8379550	8386154	That aside, recently on your show I've heard the constant complaint that in Street Fighter 4, Seth, the final boss, is a cheap bitch.
8386954	8390535	I'd like to show you all a fighting game boss that is even worse than Seth.
8390955	8398478	Someone with the definition of a cheap bitch in fighting games who has the dreaded SNK boss syndrome times 10.
8399718	8401399	Okay, so I need to take a look at this.
8403600	8408922	I'd also like to mention that the boss in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is also a cheap bitch.
8409222	8409542	Yes.
8409902	8414123	We are looking at a video here in studio of a fight from Arcana Heart 2.
8415264	8415864	That's brand new.
8417139	8418700	and I'm trying to, the video's buffering.
8418760	8419760	It's all chick fighting.
8420560	8421961	Well, that's not anything new.
8424382	8424782	Alright.
8425342	8427403	Alright, so yes, I'm looking at this boss fight.
8427763	8428343	Yes, we're watching.
8428383	8428803	It's a pretty game.
8429364	8431364	It is pretty, but she's got nice boobies.
8431524	8433765	I mean, you can't, I can't falter for that.
8433785	8434806	She's way too covered, though.
8434906	8435886	At least the one on the left is.
8436666	8438067	So the video's a little bit of a low quality.
8438087	8439948	That's what I'm saying, the one on the right.
8440208	8442168	Alright, anyway, I'm sorry.
8442228	8443489	Oh, did you see those?
8443549	8444529	Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
8444549	8446010	That's her, like, knee bouncy.
8447011	8447973	Alright, sorry, what's the rest of the email?
8448695	8452424	I'm actually just watching the... Oh my god, cheat bitch much?
8453747	8454268	Damn!
8456533	8457054	Okay, so...
8458837	8461039	They have a special pink controller that you can get for this.
8461719	8462740	Who cares?
8462780	8463260	I want it.
8464001	8464702	I want this game.
8465722	8467083	I think I'm going to have to get this game.
8467344	8467604	Alright.
8468284	8472788	So anyway, back to the email that was currently in progress.
8473668	8477111	She happens to come from the all-girl fighter called Sugoi Arcana Heart 2.
8477511	8479073	Sugoi means WOW!
8480374	8482876	Her name is... I think that's what Loki said when he saw those boobies.
8482956	8483136	Yeah.
8483720	8487382	Her name is Paraslesia, I guess.
8487803	8491525	And she just happens to be an elven woman who can summon four elemental spheres to take you down.
8491805	8493226	What makes her so bad, you may ask?
8493346	8500851	Well, first off, she has an auto-regen super meter, some special attacks that when they connect, it spells an instant 70% or more of your health depleted.
8501511	8502032	We did notice that.
8502052	8502352	Email her.
8522214	8525655	She can be beaten, but you need some mad skills to do so.
8526016	8527876	The video shows her on normal mode.
8528417	8531478	I can honestly say that she's just as bad on easier modes.
8531958	8533779	Imagine if Seth was like that, OLR.
8534379	8539421	I bet some people would have stopped playing Street Fighter 4 arcade mode altogether if Seth was that tough.
8540061	8546244	Well, you know, I do have to mention that Seth is sort of like, you know, wearing just like a thong type thing.
8546984	8549305	I would be fine if she was just wearing just a thong.
8551431	8551771	Let her finish.
8551791	8554693	Well, just wanted to show a boss that would make Seth her bitch.
8555354	8558436	Keep up the great work with the show, but Seth does gut suck.
8559456	8562098	You're fighting game addicted listener, Lioshen.
8562999	8563339	P.S.
8563359	8565420	This message is brought to you by Sugoi Arcana Hearts 2.
8565740	8567141	It's so good, you'll slap your mama.
8567662	8568402	Kidding, of course.
8568582	8569323	I love you, mama.
8569543	8570424	Peace out, OLR.
8572105	8573025	That was a pretty funny email, I think.
8573045	8577989	That means that almost every other sequel that comes out, we should all say Sugoi in front of it.
8579129	8579650	Like, wow.
8581016	8581676	Hey guys!
8581977	8584358	Oh no, sorry, I was on the next email.
8584418	8588501	Dan Shadow in chat says, Well, who doesn't have a jiggle in their breast when unleashing their special?
8588621	8590302	I can't be the only one without problem.
8590682	8594224	I think that the next email is from Dan Shadow.
8594644	8595485	Oh, well then let's hear it.
8596175	8599698	Hey guys, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is one of my most cherished games.
8600319	8605163	After school, my friends and I would go to the local pizza place and just rock that arcade every day.
8605283	8606764	I hope that a new one will be made.
8607224	8611608	To get to the point, what new Marvel fighters do you think should make it into a new game if one was made today?
8612108	8613630	Which characters deserve to get scrapped?
8613710	8619335	I personally hope Dante from Devil May Cry, the Bionic Commando, and Bucky as Captain America would be in it.
8619655	8622477	Keep it real guys, the Cold Stone is delicious.
8622777	8623798	I want Deadpool!
8625059	8627221	I want Deadpool in my damn fighting game.
8629243	8631045	Could you imagine Deadpool versus Dan?
8632646	8636550	That would be funny as fuck because it would be taunting back and forth the whole time.
8637131	8638352	Except Deadpool would pull out a gun.
8638912	8645959	I don't have the comic book knowledge to really answer that question from the Marvel standpoint, but from the Capcom standpoint, I agree with the Bionic Commando guy with the arm.
8645979	8646920	That would be pretty hilarious.
8647640	8648441	That's a good suggestion.
8648661	8650582	He was a helper in the first Marvel vs. Capcom.
8651622	8655363	This is who I would see, though, in my dream from Capcom characters.
8656203	8663005	I would actually... You totally need to leave Strider Hero in it, but I would actually have a palette swap for He-In from Strider 2.
8665566	8670907	Also, you should totally have... For playable, I agree with the new Captain America.
8671447	8671807	I agree.
8671927	8676989	We should have... Well, I would totally say put Luke Cage in it, because...
8677742	8679303	How about Arthur from Ghouls N' Ghosts?
8679383	8682905	He was a helper, and honestly, I don't see him doing the fighting type.
8683005	8685707	Unless maybe if he was on a second bard, he fought in his underwear.
8685727	8690650	Yeah, I was just going to say, when he gets down to low life, his suit gets knocked off or whatever.
8690670	8692892	Or he has the gold armor during a power-up.
8692952	8693272	I don't know.
8693412	8694013	I'm stupid.
8694033	8694953	I want Forte.
8696014	8698555	Or... Bass.
8700056	8700257	Rob.
8700697	8701978	From Rockman.
8702178	8702438	Mm-hmm.
8703279	8703379	Um...
8707951	8709653	I'd actually like to see Ingrid.
8711214	8712716	And I definitely want Sakura in the game.
8713877	8718242	I don't know.
8718262	8719464	There's just so much to choose from.
8720305	8721506	Alright, enough fanboy wank.
8721847	8722167	That's it.
8723468	8724489	Wank, wank, wank.
8724509	8727610	Speaking of wank, oh, I'm sorry, that was wang today.
8728311	8729311	Oh, in the Watchmen movie?
8729591	8729851	Yeah.
8729891	8730572	I've heard, I've heard.
8730592	8732413	Big blue cock.
8732513	8734013	I think it's all CGI, though.
8734434	8737895	Actually, I will go ahead and tell everybody this who's going to see the movie.
8739016	8743718	Unless you're like looking at his crotch, the cock is not distracting.
8745179	8746019	Unless you're looking for it.
8746059	8747480	Cock is always distracting.
8747540	8748580	I don't know, DarkSakura.
8749121	8751662	It glowed with the rest of him, so it was kind of hard to see.
8752648	8753789	Do you want six-story cock?
8776820	8778702	Do you want it to be blue and radioactive?
8778863	8779303	Yes, please.
8783348	8787173	Let's get one more story and then we're going to open up the Skype line to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR
8790575	8799642	Yeah, so, let's see, there's some possible announcements that are going to happen later this week, actually.
8800082	8813533	Supposedly on March 12th, kind of going along with their whole launch event for Resident Evil 5 in San Francisco, there is some evidence suggesting that they're going to announce a brand new Resident Evil title for the Wii.
8814213	8819918	And that Resident Evil title just might be a port or remake of Resident Evil Code Veronica.
8819938	8820018	Yeah.
8820618	8832663	and apparently there's been a lot of rumors going around saying, hey, if you're a Resident Evil Wii fan, we've got some great news for you.
8835265	8835645	I don't know.
8835705	8843310	I mean, honestly, I didn't think Code Veronica was that great from what I remember reading as far as reviews go and stuff.
8844691	8845151	I don't know.
8846132	8850134	Code Veronica did come out, though, on the GameCube back in 2003.
8851015	8856938	So maybe they're doing a Resident Evil 4 Wii version type thing for this.
8857859	8858119	I don't know.
8858159	8859760	Maybe just adding the Wii controls to it.
8860180	8862842	I don't think that would be that exciting if that's what they're doing.
8863462	8866263	But maybe a brand new Code Veronica game.
8866303	8866664	Who knows?
8866804	8868664	But maybe a brand new Resident Evil game for the Wii.
8868684	8869925	Anything, I guess, is pretty good.
8872266	8875167	AcidicVampire wonders aloud in our chat room, why Veronica?
8875207	8876048	Why not Resident Evil 2?
8877268	8877628	I don't know.
8878349	8887473	Maybe because, you know, not that... I want to say not that many people had a Dreamcast, but compared to the Wii, not that many people had a Dreamcast.
8889550	8894354	and the Rob D in chat says the reviews for the Code Veronica were all pretty good on the Dreamcast.
8895415	8900959	Alright, hey, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8900999	8903541	We are going to open up the phone lines right now to take your calls.
8904121	8905803	Do we have any last minute stories while we're waiting?
8905983	8911947	I think we hit out almost everything that was in the show roll thread this week, but I don't know, Loki, did anything come up last minute tonight?
8912028	8912588	Or DarkSakura?
8913108	8913469	Cock.
8913489	8916871	I was waiting for you to take a sip.
8916931	8917592	I timed it wrong.
8919209	8919769	Yeah, I had coffee.
8920190	8924312	I ran in during that last story because I've drank two cups of coffee, so you know why I had to run in the house.
8924652	8925233	I don't need to explain.
8925253	8926013	Rob had to tinkle.
8926213	8926413	Yes.
8928875	8929995	I don't know.
8930076	8935519	I guess like a small thing, I guess some of the cars from Burnout are going to be in Godfather 2.
8936619	8937200	Interesting.
8937240	8939141	That doesn't make any sense to me, but okay.
8939361	8939601	All right.
8939621	8940442	We got a call on the line.
8940482	8941482	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8941502	8941863	Who's this?
8942762	8944062	Brest Law, how you guys doing?
8944102	8945023	Brest Law!
8945103	8947224	Damn, we haven't heard from you on the show in a long time.
8947244	8950145	You know, in chat, you never shut up, but it's nice to hear your actual voice.
8950165	8950725	How have you been?
8950745	8951985	I don't know what you're talking about.
8953106	8953706	How have you been, sir?
8954486	8960588	I have been well, except for my Xbox red-ringing, which is the complete stem of that little rant I wrote on our news page.
8962669	8971492	But before it red-ringed, a mini-review of a game that's been out for a while, the Sega Sonic Genesis Mega Collection.
8971692	8971872	Yes.
8973257	8974818	I don't know if you guys have talked about this.
8975138	8975498	We have.
8975558	8978099	We lavished Fanboy Wank upon it a few weeks ago.
8979160	8983882	It's probably the best bang for your buck on the Xbox right now.
8984122	8985542	It's almost 50 games for $30.
8987743	8988984	And you can get a lot of play out of it.
8989004	8992245	You get two Shining Forces, four Phantasy Stars, all the Sonics.
8993506	8996187	There's at least 80 hours of gameplay in there.
8998088	8999848	What I didn't really like is...
9001488	9004452	You can change the video settings, but it's only within each game.
9004632	9005634	There's not a global setting.
9005994	9006996	That gets kind of annoying.
9008398	9015347	The games also, just like everything else that's happened with old ports, they don't look good in 720p.
9015708	9016149	No, they don't.
9016389	9016950	You know what, though?
9018131	9023273	I agree maybe a global setting would be nice, but the game does remember from game to game how you have it set.
9023313	9028756	So some games look better with that stretched faux 16x9 than others.
9028896	9034599	Other games were not meant to be played in that stretched 16x9, but games like Sonic Spinball actually work really well in the stretched 16x9.
9036249	9065770	absolutely I agree with that I mean a lot of those Sonic games look good in 16x9 and you know the smoothing feature is probably one of the worst things I've seen but there's two games that actually look good with them and they're Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles but overall it's 30 bucks go get it yeah it's not bad I actually reviewed it on PlayStation 3 because I when I went to get it they didn't have it on 360 so I just said eh what the hell it's the same game so I got it on PlayStation 3 but you know same same and it's a great collection yeah absolutely and um
9066974	9067595	Super Mario Bros.
9067615	9068155	3 vs. Rock Band
9083573	9089758	And I know at least one person on the air right now voted Rock Band very protest-like.
9090399	9090579	Yes.
9091459	9093061	But that was me.
9093941	9100286	Just because I wanted revenge on Tetris for it beating Super Metroid, but I still believe Rock Band has no business being in the top four games of all time.
9100707	9102708	Mario 3, I can see that.
9102868	9103369	I can see that.
9105116	9109079	That comes from this show's roots as a music game show.
9109099	9110719	Sure, I understand that.
9111300	9114602	Please, I spent most of my gaming week playing Rock Band.
9114622	9119284	It's not that I dislike Rock Band by any means, but it's no Mario 3.
9119705	9123567	It's no Final Four game, and it's no One Seed.
9124207	9125208	Maybe in a couple years.
9125268	9127069	It needs to age like a wine a little bit.
9127591	9129493	Link to the Past
9151592	9164984	I still have a hard time accepting that Chrono Trigger beat Final Fantasy 6, but that's my own, because I love Final Fantasy 6, but I understand there is so much fanboy wank, for lack of a better term, out there for Chrono Trigger, especially with the recent release.
9165324	9174172	I can see that, but I'm a little disappointed that Final Fantasy 6 didn't pull through, but I guess if it's going to be beat, at least it didn't get beat by like...
9174813	9175954	DDR or something.
9175974	9176495	You know what I mean?
9176575	9179298	If Final Fantasy 6 is going to get beaten by a game, at least it was Chrono Trigger.
9179338	9181721	At least I can say, okay, I understand that.
9182061	9182542	You know what I mean?
9183183	9186747	Yeah, and it's the same thing along Mario 3 beating DDR, finally.
9187147	9187307	Yeah.
9189909	9198515	Also, if you haven't heard and you are in the Pacific Northwest area, the convention that I staff at, SakuraCon, is going to have SmileDK there.
9198675	9201997	It's their second North American appearance ever.
9202818	9207240	It's in a month, so I think pre-registration closes next Sunday.
9208381	9212364	I think it's $45 for all three days, so if you want to go and meet SmileDK.
9213204	9216586	Also, we're going to be doing Under Sedation Live on location.
9217407	9218588	Is Travis going out there for that?
9219147	9225111	Travis is not, but we have an internet connection and they're sure to be a lot of fun involved with that.
9226352	9226632	You know what?
9226692	9233456	If the Southwest prices stay low, I might just have to consider it because my friend can give me a really good discount on rooms and stuff.
9234117	9240261	I might have to consider it, Press Low, because especially if you can get us an interview with SmileDK, I might really have to do it.
9240921	9241942	Oh, dude, absolutely.
9243055	9243435	Interesting.
9244276	9244776	I don't know.
9244816	9248459	I can't speak for the other two, but I will always take an excuse to go to Seattle.
9249499	9249960	Absolutely.
9250240	9251681	I took an excuse to move here.
9252001	9260687	I don't know, but then at the same time, I've also been promising Chicago for years and years, and I kind of feel like an obligation that if I'm going to do one, I kind of need to make ASEN happen, but we'll see.
9262079	9262399	All righty.
9262859	9266121	Well, that's it, really, from here in Seattle.
9266321	9268041	So, nice hearing from you guys again.
9268301	9268682	All right.
9268762	9270382	Thank you as well, Breslow.
9270422	9272523	And keep writing those articles for the website.
9272783	9273103	Good time.
9273123	9273363	All right.
9274064	9275144	And by the way... Yes.
9277345	9278865	He hung up on us, little bastard.
9279265	9279526	All right.
9282519	9290984	By the way, speaking of articles on the website, while we're waiting for another call at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, I wanted to plug something on the website real quick.
9291004	9296027	It's an article that was just posted, and I thought this was actually a pretty good idea, something that was posted by Deekman.
9296327	9302210	Kind of a different contest here for the best Konami games, because Konami's 40th birthday is coming up in a couple weeks.
9303951	9314477	We are going to actually do on OrangeLoungeRadio.com the top three favorite Konami games is what you post, and then we're going to count down the top five games in special highlight articles.
9314897	9315517	That's kind of fun.
9315898	9317738	So kind of counting down the top Konami games.
9318219	9325102	Obviously, we have a history with Konami here at this station, so I fully expect that Beatmania 2DX will be the number one.
9325182	9325883	How can it not?
9326583	9331105	With our audience, I would be shocked and awed if Beatmania 2DX is not number one.
9331125	9332126	That wouldn't be my number one.
9332914	9335295	I don't know.
9335395	9336976	I'd have to sit down and think long and hard.
9336996	9339258	I'd really have to look at a big list of Konami games.
9339578	9341279	I would put some obscure shit in there, though.
9341679	9342199	I would tell you that.
9342239	9343620	You know what the top of my list would be, Rob?
9343680	9344020	What's that?
9344300	9347262	Dracula X. Ah, ooh, that is Castlevania.
9347702	9348282	Now it's tough.
9348583	9349743	That one specifically.
9350304	9351064	I know, I know.
9352485	9355446	So check that out on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
9355486	9360349	Let's go back to the phones because it's been ringing, and I'm sorry, guys, if I haven't been picking up, but I wanted to get that out there.
9360589	9361550	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9361570	9361890	Who's this?
9362711	9363512	Hey, it's Ranma.
9363532	9364272	What's up, everyone?
9364472	9364792	Not much.
9364812	9365453	How you doing, Ranma?
9366734	9366954	Good.
9366994	9369996	I'm recovering from restoring windows on my computer.
9370036	9371497	But other than that, life's been pretty good.
9371677	9371897	Yeah.
9373258	9373738	Good, good.
9373938	9375480	What do we owe this phone call to tonight?
9376420	9378602	Some information that I happened to come across.
9378642	9381023	I meant to discuss the last time I spoke to you guys.
9382204	9386487	Now, as you know, Sega was at Comic-Con back in February.
9387728	9388028	Mm-hmm.
9388846	9394352	It seems that another video game company is looking into going at the conventions as well.
9395413	9395793	How so?
9397215	9403001	Well, as you guys know, I work for a company where we go to cons, we set up booths, and we sell items.
9403521	9403762	Now...
9404540	9414203	We're doing Anime Boston in May, and we just got information about a couple of weeks ago, about two, three weeks ago, about our location, where we're going to be.
9414923	9421585	It seems that our booth is going to be, you ready for this, directly across from Nintendo.
9422626	9424286	Huh, interesting.
9426607	9429288	Wow, okay, so Nintendo is going around the cons.
9429328	9430708	What do you think they're going to be showing off?
9430868	9432689	Do you think it's just the Wii, or what?
9433664	9434685	I really don't know.
9434865	9447658	I'm thinking either they're going to be like a booth version of Nintendo World set up there, or actually Nintendo will be coming down with kiosks with the displays that show off a lot of games.
9450481	9457288	Considering the business that you're in, if it's what I think it is, if it's still the same, I think that's very funny that you're going to be directly across from Nintendo, actually.
9458860	9471579	Well, because they kind of screwed us over at one convention, they gave us first dibs, and when we picked it, that's when we found out afterwards that Nintendo's directly across from us, so everyone at the booth will be doing Nintendo-themed cosplays.
9472876	9474177	Ha ha, I see.
9474237	9475777	Okay, trying to get some attention.
9475937	9476478	Very smart.
9477258	9477998	Well, we try.
9478078	9478658	Very smart.
9479159	9488843	Well, I expect a full report and pictures because sadly, Anime Boston, I don't think, you know, considering I've got two other cons I'm trying to weigh between, I don't think Anime Boston's going to happen.
9489203	9494505	However, however, PAX East Coast in 2010, you know I want to go to that.
9494985	9496566	Oh, you best be there, man.
9496606	9498286	That will be my arrival in Boston.
9498326	9501648	And I have internet friends in that area that I want to go visit anyway, so it works out.
9503106	9503646	So we'll see.
9504267	9505368	Well, good luck with that.
9505688	9508190	Any other conventions coming up that we ought to know about or our listeners?
9509331	9525064	Well, if you're in New York, New Jersey, Tri-State area coming up, we have Castle Point Anime Convention, Hoboken, New Jersey, and Icon 29, I believe, which is one of the East Coast's biggest sci-fi conventions.
9525144	9527246	It's sci-fi and medieval arts.
9528891	9531312	Alright, sci-fi and medieval arts.
9532273	9539256	It reminds me of that whole Margaret Cho joke about why is it that Star Trek always seems to go hand-in-hand with the Ren Faire.
9540657	9541878	I don't know, sorry, random thought.
9542478	9546440	I don't know about you, but Star Trek can go with almost anything, you know?
9546760	9547741	It really can, it really can.
9547801	9550602	Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much.
9550622	9551003	Alright, cool.
9551183	9552003	Alright, later.
9553024	9555905	There's a lot of you guys hammering the line tonight, so I want to try to get to as many calls as I can.
9555965	9557246	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9558422	9561424	DSMaster26 Hi DSMaster26, what's on your mind?
9562765	9576957	Not much more game review for you and a few comments and suggestions for the show Alrighty Well, um, cause I'm an F-Zero fan, I mean, who isn't in this house, you know?
9577577	9580579	Love F-Zero, wish they would put a new one out on the Wii already, yeah?
9581880	9587605	And just to fill the time, I'm waiting for a freaking DS version to come out I have a PSP here, as you can tell
9588240	9592323	And so I'm like, you know, it's a lot better to fill it than wipe out pure, right?
9593563	9595705	So I'm like, okay.
9597025	9598486	I stored up everything.
9598506	9604150	I have all my friend's game saves who had all the classic packs and everything because I can't download them for some weirdo reason.
9604170	9606291	They closed the site to download stuff for them.
9607052	9610654	But it's a little bit more challenging than that, so I'll tell you that.
9611903	9612143	It is.
9612203	9614564	I've played the Wipeout on PlayStation Network.
9614604	9615425	I can't remember the name of it.
9615525	9616745	I think it's just Wipeout HD.
9617245	9619747	And it's a little harder than F-Zero.
9619827	9621507	It's such a different style, too.
9621667	9625769	F-Zero to me is a little more cartoony, but don't take that too literally.
9625949	9626470	You know what I mean?
9626550	9631932	Like F-Zero GX especially, which is one of my favorite racing games ever, is not definitely a cartoony-looking game.
9631952	9636774	But Wipeout feels a little more, I don't know, just a little more edgy than F-Zero.
9638335	9640156	Usually that's a term that means one's better than the other.
9640196	9640676	Not in this case.
9644322	9647844	I don't know, but it's so hard to get on your show sometimes.
9649065	9654228	Have you guys ever thought of doing an open mic or conference call with Skype?
9654868	9657350	Like AGI and DPL did?
9658530	9658950	What do you mean?
9659011	9663093	Like just opening it up so that every person can come on and chat and stuff?
9666935	9676437	I think the only problem with that is that we try to cover a lot of ground during the show, and I think if we did that, it would just kind of turn into this giant cluster of a show.
9676897	9686239	What I would love, I would love to take calls throughout the show, but we need somebody to screen the calls in order to be able to do that to make sure people are going to stay on topic again so the show can flow.
9686719	9690440	One of the feedback I hear about the show very often is that it's almost a little too long.
9690860	9694561	So I would just be afraid that if we did kind of just... I mean, we got on enough tangents as it is.
9694601	9699103	If we let it get on even more tangents, I'd just be afraid we'd be here for six hours.
9699563	9705305	Which, you know, I do love this show, but I also love going to bed at a decent hour.
9706145	9709446	But, you know, that's why we do at least a Skype line, try to get the feedback.
9709506	9713028	And I know not everybody can always get through, but we try to do the emails and chat room comments.
9713048	9719290	And we like to think, out of all the gaming podcasts out there, we're one of the more interactive ones that are out there.
9719310	9720791	But I know there's other shows doing their thing.
9721091	9725313	But speaking of all games and all that stuff, you know, look forward to at E3...
9727017	9727697	Thanks for watching!
9746142	9751366	I would love to do live E3 shows where the listeners can call in and ask us questions and all that.
9752007	9759193	But I don't know if without the E3X, or what do they call it, the E3 Arena this year, I don't know if that's going to be as possible.
9759233	9760194	It's going to be interesting.
9761174	9768961	By the way, I also saw an episode of Sessler's Soapbox a dollar a day.
9769761	9775506	And actually, strange enough, I didn't get it from the G4 TV set of my PSP, because get this,
9776072	9776853	Thank you for watching!
9791791	9797153	I'm sorry, I don't understand why you'd want to close out one of your... Why would you want to shut the door on your listeners?
9797233	9804816	I mean, I guess when you're a TV station and you have that type of money, you can make those types of decisions, but I just think it's crazy talk to close the door.
9804836	9810819	I mean, maybe it was costing them too much to produce, but how much can it cost to translate a movie into PSP format?
9810839	9811579	It seems a little silly.
9811599	9812319	A little silly.
9813840	9819462	Yeah, and Fessler's Soapbox was going on about kids playing Emory games and how, you know,
9820014	9825635	It's no different than some kid possibly, you know, seen in a Radar movie.
9825695	9831937	I mean, heck, when I was 11, I saw The Matrix and I was, you know, Radar.
9832557	9834397	Did I end up doing sniping people?
9834777	9835037	No.
9835718	9841919	Frickin' Chad Thompson, who's, well, thank God, disbarred, um...
9843203	9844925	Music is head screwed up straight.
9845905	9846226	I know.
9846426	9853112	Unfortunately, these guys run with the one bad apple that ruins it for the rest of us normal people.
9853372	9853832	You know what I mean?
9855394	9863641	Yeah, because of that, the only other way I was able to get my hands on GTA LCS was on Amazon with my debit card.
9864061	9865162	Yes, I have one.
9866120	9870784	I used to have a job, but now I'm dead broke with only $1.20 in my account.
9870804	9872426	I don't have enough to pay taxes.
9872486	9873407	I am so screwed.
9874507	9875008	Oh, no.
9875028	9877190	Starting to get a little depressing.
9877270	9877510	All right.
9878371	9882374	Well, is there anything else you wanted to comment on before we try to get some more calls?
9884516	9884916	Yeah.
9885116	9889860	You know, I kind of listened back to episode 312 and what Dan said.
9889900	9891662	I went over to GameStop and whatever.
9891682	9892923	You know, like,
9893633	9896135	Sorry, we still can't give you a replacement or whatever.
9897295	9907361	And so, basically, I don't know what else to go at here other than spend $20 on a faceplate and whatever and replace next.
9907421	9908782	I think that might be the issue.
9910243	9913405	It might be what you're going to have to do at this point.
9913525	9915206	Were you using it in the shower?
9916096	9916816	Prioritize.
9916836	9917176	Prioritize.
9917296	9917977	Prioritize.
9941843	9954488	Yeah, because I spent a bunch of money on my prom date with my girlfriend who also plays Destroy All Humans and says that's better than GTA because she says flying saucers are better than tanks, but I don't know.
9954848	9955789	What's your view on that?
9956549	9957409	Prioritize.
9960230	9966373	Since I've been a prom date before, I wouldn't have wanted a whole lot of money spent on me if it was at the expense of someone being able to pay their bills.
9969210	9972612	But, you know, it's all going to be worth it because we're going to be watching Twilight.
9974412	9974712	Alright.
9974992	9976373	Well, anyway, DS Master, we've got to let you go.
9976393	9978694	We've got to get some more calls before we end up.
9978714	9981155	But thank you so much for your call, and good luck with the monies.
9981375	9984536	I know it's a tight time for a lot of people right now, but things will work out.
9984556	9985456	They always do.
9985916	9986657	Alright, good luck, buddy.
9987277	9989098	Peace out, and keep rocking the show.
9989178	9989838	Alright, we'll try.
9989998	9990258	See ya.
9991055	9994656	All right, we'll probably take like one more call on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9994776	10000818	I wanted to read some comments that were in chat, and now I can't find them.
10000898	10001258	Darn it.
10001898	10002979	It was a little while ago.
10004039	10006900	Oh, SSJ100Matt says, OLR was the first show to use Skype.
10007100	10011602	I still believe to this day that that is true, that we were, but nobody probably believes me.
10011682	10012702	Anyway, we got one more call.
10012722	10014442	We'll take it, and then we're going to wrap up the show.
10014502	10015483	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10015503	10015803	Who's this?
10016727	10017468	It's Deathwishing.
10017648	10018388	Hi, Deathwishing.
10018408	10018929	What's on your mind?
10020010	10023092	First, I'd like to say no more cock jokes, DarkSakura.
10023112	10025674	You got a whole chat storm of cock jokes, and it was very...
10027501	10027801	All right.
10028041	10037486	Unfortunately, that happens sometimes, is that one funny thing is said and the chat just won't let it die, but that's just part of the... It's a revival of the old Big Black Cock.
10038387	10038987	Oh, God.
10039407	10040288	It's Charm?
10040768	10041208	I don't know.
10042169	10042709	Oh, I forget it.
10042729	10043710	What did you call in about tonight?
10045331	10047592	I would like to comment on the Guitar Hero, you know.
10048172	10049273	Holy crap, there's a lot of them.
10050892	10052233	For real, right?
10052893	10056375	Did you hear earlier when we were saying can you hear the milking of the franchise?
10056435	10062837	I personally call it, you know the weird 30-year-old guy that stays in his mom's basement and has an addiction to porn?
10062877	10064578	It's pretty much he's running out of Vaseline.
10064618	10066839	You better watch it because I've got two of those three.
10066899	10068760	I'm 30 years old and addicted to porn.
10068800	10070361	But do you live with your mom?
10070441	10071341	No, I don't, thankfully.
10071601	10072282	That's the thing.
10075563	10077864	Wait, so what about the guys that live with their mom?
10078384	10079885	These are the guys that are going to be buying the games?
10080618	10082679	No, no, I'm just saying that's like an example.
10082779	10084460	That's an example of what they're doing to it.
10085401	10089263	My problem is that the Guitar Hero games aren't exactly the same as like Rock Band.
10089283	10096327	Whereas Rock Band, say for example, someone was actually doing a comparison with the amount of games that Rock Band releases.
10096367	10102570	And to be honest, the games that they release, like the track packs or whatever, it's just download content that's available now on disc.
10102910	10104871	It's not something that you necessarily need to buy.
10104911	10107233	It's nothing new unless you don't have internet.
10107853	10114697	But the Guitar Hero games, they're all these different new tracks that you can't dump together.
10114917	10120220	So you have to buy all these games, and each one has to be played separate, and that's retarded.
10120801	10126684	And that's one thing I really like about Rock Band 2 as well, is that it seems like the developers of Rock Band are continuing to add to Rock Band 2.
10126764	10131127	Granted, yeah, you got the ACDC game, but they didn't really bother to promote that that much.
10131167	10134149	It was just kind of a one-off thing, like, hey, this is out there, you can get this.
10134189	10134529	You want it?
10134589	10134829	Go get it.
10134989	10138072	And then everything is pouring into Rock Band 2.
10138112	10140434	They have all this regular content and so on and so on.
10140755	10144478	And sure, okay, the Beatles game is going to be a completely separate game.
10144678	10145839	But it's the fucking Beatles.
10145859	10146420	They're allowed.
10146840	10148462	Well, and that's the deal that they had.
10148502	10154668	They would have done it as a Rock Band track pack, but the people that have the Beatles license, they're like, uh, no.
10154868	10156369	Which, again, it's the Beatles.
10156550	10157110	They're allowed.
10157250	10158752	There's not a lot of bands I'd say that for.
10160509	10161649	Thanks for watching!
10181678	10185299	I don't know, it's all these games, all these artist-specific games.
10185939	10193501	To me, it sounds very risky because not everyone loves Metallica, not everyone loves Van Halen, not everyone loves Aerosmith.
10193601	10195561	I hate Smith.
10195641	10201302	And the other thing, too, they're all, well, you get 40-some tracks for $60 or whatever, that's a great deal.
10202062	10203763	I might not want all those tracks.
10203823	10206123	At least with Rock Band, I can pick and choose what I want.
10207644	10208824	And that's why I love Rock Band.
10210562	10226094	from a gamer standpoint right now somebody who's been playing music games for about 10 years now I definitely prefer Rock Band to Guitar Hero at this point in time for these reasons that we've been stating it's just a better package to me
10227615	10233401	And plus, also consider this, the Guitar Hero on tour, the DS one, eh, you know, what are they trying to do with that?
10233421	10235343	The DS one gives you carpal tunnel.
10235363	10240127	Yeah, and they're trying to condense the guitar playing experience into the DS, which just doesn't really work.
10240147	10246193	And honestly, those DS games, they're about as different with each other as, unfortunately, the guitar-freeze games in the arcades.
10246253	10250918	It's basically trackless update, trackless update, let's reskin it a little bit, done.
10251058	10252280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10263039	10270304	No stupid peripheral to plug in my PSP, just making music in a way that's just different.
10271205	10272746	It sounds great.
10273026	10275929	Now, here's a thought.
10276189	10277030	This would be kind of cool.
10277390	10289520	Can you imagine if they were to do a game like that for, say, the 360 or whatever, and the PS3 kind of like this amplitude rock band thing, but it took all the music that you downloaded from rock band and allowed you to use that?
10290612	10292113	Jizz in my pants
10305900	10307121	AudioSurf AudioSurf
10335819	10339482	All right, well, hey, any other final thoughts before we get on out of here and wrap up the show?
10339502	10343886	I went to UCLA, and they have two Street Fighter cabinets, four cabinets there.
10344507	10345728	At UCLA, really?
10346169	10346469	Yeah.
10346609	10347370	Big scene there?
10347670	10348711	Were they busy?
10349271	10352114	Well, I went there when it was lunch because I'm not that old.
10352154	10352454	I'm only 16.
10352554	10354136	I went on a field trip there.
10354937	10358420	And there was, like, it was lunchtime.
10358460	10359100	There was about, like...
10359963	10361424	Arcade Infinity Arcade Infinity
10380018	10408532	it's out in City of Industry and actually we've back in the day when we were much more into the DDR and Beatmania we would drive all the way from Sacramento where we're based to go to this arcade to play some of the legendary games I think it was the Gundam game that was epic there was just so many epic games I haven't been there in a long time but I imagine they've got quite a crowd of people too around these fighting games so you know there's definitely an audience for it the only arcades I ever really went to were like I think the Sega one I knew near me
10409572	10410233	Oh, GameWorks.
10410293	10411054	Which has gone now.
10411114	10411834	No, it's all Sega.
10411874	10414276	It was all Sega, but then it got turned into GameWorks, I think.
10415237	10417579	Oh, because I knew that GameWorks was a Sega arcade.
10417919	10419881	I think I know what he's talking about.
10419921	10421082	I can't remember.
10421102	10422343	I might have been there once, but anyway.
10422403	10425746	It had this awesome helicopter game where you rolled around and stuff.
10425766	10426327	The Sega 360.
10427448	10428689	Was that the Tatsu?
10429349	10430050	Was that a Sega thing?
10430090	10431211	That's the Sega 360.
10431371	10431651	Was it?
10431931	10434253	It's a lot better than the Tatsu thing.
10434754	10435094	Oh, okay.
10435114	10435875	A little different.
10436550	10438511	But arcades are pretty much dead now.
10439051	10444034	And it's sad because, you know, all the online gaming has really put a dent in it.
10444174	10446115	It's going to take something epic to bring people back.
10446156	10446636	But who knows?
10446736	10447997	Maybe when the recession wraps up.
10448017	10449417	I know a way to bring back arcades.
10449738	10450598	Real quick, what is it?
10451218	10451599	Boobs.
10455221	10456061	We'll see what happens.
10456101	10458342	All right, Deathwishing, we've got to let you go to wrap up this show.
10458663	10460644	Good luck on your quest for boobs in arcades.
10461963	10462223	All right.
10462924	10463924	I'll be a millionaire one day.
10463984	10464485	Just watch.
10464565	10464905	All right.
10465525	10466406	You heard it here first.
10466526	10466806	All right.
10467467	10468067	Take care, buddy.
10468807	10469068	Bye.
10470749	10477013	I wonder if anybody's thought about trying that, like mixing a strip club with an arcade with, I don't know, maybe there's local laws.
10477113	10477653	I approve.
10477673	10477973	I don't know.
10479454	10482696	No, I mean, that's just a strip club with an arcade in it.
10482736	10484898	The problem is, though, is you really want, I mean...
10486019	10494864	They don't want arcade games in a strip club because one, you have to pay money to get into a strip club and two, it takes away from the time that the strippers have with you so they can't get paid.
10495765	10498907	What if you got a lap dance while playing Street Fighter 4?
10499027	10499787	That'd be distracting.
10499807	10500828	Yeah, it would be a little distracting.
10502248	10502609	I tried.
10503549	10506651	Alright, we're going to take a minute to wrap up the show here.
10506671	10510573	But a strip club with video game themes, that could be doable.
10511914	10514956	Or video games and anime themes, that could be doable.
10516249	10517830	That sounds like a bad convention.
10517930	10519951	Like a cosplay strip club.
10520291	10522072	But not with nasty looking chicks.
10522112	10527655	Is that like when Consumer Electronics Show is going on at the same time as the adult video convention?
10527695	10528496	Something like that, yeah.
10528516	10529896	Remember they just need to combine them into one?
10531798	10533259	All right, we've got to wrap up the show.
10533299	10534040	Enough silly talk.
10534060	10535021	We need to wrap up the show.
10535061	10536863	We were running a little long tonight, which is fine.
10536883	10538684	We've had a good show, a lot of good discussion tonight.
10539245	10540186	Yeah, it was a good show.
10540226	10542027	Good calls, good discussion, good chat.
10542448	10545110	I'm feeling good about tonight's show, so thank you all for making it a success.
10545470	10548373	I don't think there's any more last-minute stories, right, Loki?
10548393	10549354	You said you had them all wrapped up.
10549374	10552817	Yeah, there's some Guitar Hero stuff coming out this month, including Queen.
10553498	10555800	No, we'll download tracks, including Queen.
10556380	10557161	Oh, well, that is epic.
10557601	10559563	I will premise a story for Queen.
10559863	10567210	Yeah, so there's some interesting songs, including, I'm trying to think what they were now, as I pull this up.
10568051	10571715	I think Killer Queen was one of them, which is interesting.
10571935	10574757	And then, let's see here.
10575138	10578781	It was nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody or anything cool like that, unfortunately.
10580403	10581944	Oh, here we go, here we go.
10610168	10616813	They had Killer Queen, which is going to be part of the Queen Track Pack.
10617134	10618275	We Are The Champions.
10619135	10620516	Actually, no, Killer Queen isn't in that.
10620636	10624500	It's We Are The Champions, Fat Bottom Girls, and Sea Liberty.
10625160	10628723	And those are all going to be available in the Queen Track Pack on March 26th.
10629023	10634608	The week before that, they're going to have the Jimi Hendrix Track Pack with Freedom, Angel, and Foxy Lady, the live version.
10634748	10635088	Nice.
10635569	10636830	On March 19th.
10636910	10639552	Also available March 19th would be the European Track Pack.
10639972	10641813	I'm not sure if these were available in Europe.
10641873	10643754	I'm sure it might be just European bands.
10644354	10656001	With What Have You Done by Within Temptation, I Are Comet Alex by Dai Toten Hosen, and Carolina by M-Klan.
10656461	10664586	And then finally, available last week, Break It Out by Vanilla Sky, In The Shadows by Rasmus, and C.S.
10664626	10665006	Comey's
10666947	10671068	by Lesrita Mitsuko.
10671248	10671608	I don't know.
10671648	10673009	I think I butchered that last name.
10674009	10675189	Mitsuko.
10675490	10675670	Yeah.
10676870	10677170	All right.
10678351	10678551	Okay.
10678671	10679331	We got to wrap up.
10679451	10683112	We're going to get all the closing thoughts and wrap on out of here for tonight.
10683392	10684633	We are running a little long tonight.
10684793	10686434	The show is very, very long, but that's all right.
10686454	10686934	It was a good show.
10687494	10689134	DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight.
10689295	10690195	Happy birthday, Chris.
10691368	10691748	I agree!
10691829	10692850	Happy birthday, Chris!
10693210	10694051	How dare I not say anything?
10694071	10697134	I left her a message on Facebook earlier, but, you know, just got sidetracked with the show.
10698355	10700857	Yes, happy birthday, Chris, one of the OLR lesbians.
10702058	10707484	My final thought would be I am craving Pringles.
10709265	10713970	And no, this isn't a G4 show back in the day that were all sponsored by Pringles, but I really am craving Pringles.
10714070	10714971	Loki, your final thought.
10716118	10717459	I am not craving Pringles.
10717959	10718939	Pringles are nasty.
10718979	10719819	Pringles are not nasty.
10719839	10720660	You're nasty.
10721880	10722400	We're done.
10722480	10723041	We're out of here.
10723121	10723701	Have a great week.
