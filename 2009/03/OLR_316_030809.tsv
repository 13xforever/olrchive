18000	21000	New Kingdom Fighters 12 details are revealed

24000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
33000	36000	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	40000	We are that podcast, radio show dedicated to video games
40000	43000	Video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
43000	45000	My name is Rob Roberts joining you every week
45000	47000	Here on All Games Radio
47000	49000	6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time Live
49000	51000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
51000	54000	And joining me as always say hello to the one and only
54000	56000	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
56000	57000	Yo
57000	58000	How you doing DarkSakura?
58000	60000	Mmm, interesting
60000	61000	Yeah, interesting?
61000	62000	Interesting
62000	64000	Okay, I get interesting good or interesting bad
64000	67000	Because interesting is a very, uh, interesting term
67000	68000	Interesting neutral
68000	69000	Okay, fair enough
69000	72000	Suddenly I feel like we're talking about D&D alignments or something
72000	74000	You're chaotic interesting
74000	76000	It's funny, I took a D&D alignment test
76000	78000	And I had taken the same one before
78000	79000	Right
79000	80000	And I came out chaotic good before
80000	81000	Last time I came out true neutral
81000	83000	But, you know, feelings change
83000	85000	How long ago was it that you took the test?
85000	86000	About a couple years ago
86000	88000	People change, you know
88000	91000	People sometimes shift their political ideals
91000	92000	Over years and years, you know
92000	93000	People change
93000	95000	We change our opinions on games
95000	96000	I remember a time on this show
96000	97000	We've been doing this show a long time
97000	98000	About seven years, right?
98000	100000	And I remember a time on this show where it was like
100000	103000	Xbox was the butt of all our jokes we ever made on this show
103000	105000	Like the ginormous controllers of the original Xbox
105000	107000	And now Xbox is pretty cool
107000	108000	I think all of us can agree
108000	109000	360's got a lot of great stuff on it
109000	110000	So it's just interesting
110000	111000	Right, Tech Master Loki?
111000	113000	And it's also not the size of a house
113000	114000	That's right
114000	115000	How you doing, Tech Master Loki?
115000	116000	Fine
116000	117000	Yeah?
117000	118000	Yeah
118000	119000	You have a good week?
119000	120000	Yeah, it was a pretty good week
120000	122000	I understand you finally got to Airsoft today
122000	123000	Yes, finally
123000	124000	How was that?
124000	125000	It was fun
125000	128000	I don't know, we played like three games
128000	130000	We played at a different place than normal
130000	134000	Because I didn't want to drive an hour to where we normally play
134000	138000	So we played at a field next to my work
138000	140000	And it was pretty nice
140000	142000	And there's lots of rocks
142000	145000	Because people might not know
145000	148000	But Folsom used to be a big mining town
148000	153000	And, well, they used to dredge and stuff in the river
153000	158000	And there are piles and piles of cobblestones
158000	160000	All over the place out there
160000	162000	And that's all the ground is, is cobblestones
162000	164000	Thankfully there was some dirt on there
164000	165000	So it wasn't so bad
165000	169000	But there's cobblestone hills that we were on top of
169000	173000	And there's a bunch of eucalyptus trees that they planted there for some reason
173000	175000	So it's like a big jungle out there
175000	177000	First person shooters for real, right?
177000	178000	Yep
178000	180000	I got to try out one of my new guns
180000	182000	And it's so awesome
182000	186000	My other guns, my older ones, not so awesome
186000	189000	And of course there's always you guys who join us here every week
189000	191000	On Orange Lounge Radio when we tape live
191000	195000	And you can join us in our chatroom live chat.orangeloungeradio.com
195000	198000	Or on the Game Surge Network for you IRC fans
198000	200000	At channel Orange Lounge
200000	202000	And the first comment tonight from Shadowrunner
202000	206000	Xbox is awesome until the Red Ring of Death and then it's fail
206000	207000	Good point
207000	211000	You know, the Xbox has taken a lot of crap for the Red Ring
211000	214000	And sure, Microsoft's, you know, kind of done the whole
214000	217000	Oops, our bad, we're going to extend the warranties and all that on that
217000	219000	But it makes me think of an article, if I can work in a cheap plug here
219000	221000	For the new orangeloungeradio.com website
221000	224000	Which has actually been, you know, thanks to our new writing staff
224000	226000	Has had a pretty constant stream of new articles
226000	227000	I got to say it's pretty awesome
227000	229000	One of them was written by Bresloll earlier this week
229000	231000	And he was kind of talking about, is it just me
231000	236000	Or are these new console systems just not built to last
236000	238000	Like the old ones
238000	241000	Like he was kind of saying, you know, I could probably still find a Nintendo that works
241000	243000	Or a Super Nintendo that works
243000	245000	And come to think of it, you know, I was kind of reading the article
245000	249000	And, you know, yeah, I don't think I ever, ever had a console break
249000	251000	Until the Xbox 360
251000	253000	But then there's also another argument that says, well look
253000	256000	Consoles broke all the time, you just didn't hear about it
256000	260000	Because now the internet culture, you know, one person's console breaks
260000	262000	In a, you know, over the top way
262000	264000	And it hits every game blog on the internet
264000	266000	And, you know, millions of people read about it
266000	268000	Kind of different interesting schools of thought
268000	273000	But, I don't know, you know, old school 8-bit NESs might still work
273000	275000	But you still have to blow on the cartridge
275000	278000	And blow in the system to get it to work, you know
278000	280000	Unless you're lucky enough to have a top loader
280000	286000	Well, with the 360, it's basically praying that it's not gonna break
286000	290000	Because, you know, it's like if you look at it funny, it's like
290000	292000	I'm gonna die now
292000	294000	I hope you're happy
294000	298000	I know, you just kind of hope that it's gonna last, you know, the full three years
298000	302000	Well, it's just like the 360 that I fixed that's modded
302000	305000	I'm just surprised each day that it works
305000	309000	Because it's like, there's no reason that this should work, but it is
309000	311000	Every day is a new gift
311000	313000	Yes, exactly
313000	317000	GS68 in chat says, hey, some of my Super Nintendo games don't work anymore
317000	319000	Here's what I'm curious about
319000	324000	Does those batteries, remember how batteries were only supposed to last like five years
324000	327000	The batteries that they have in like the Zelda games or the battery backup
327000	330000	Did anybody ever read the fine print that those things were only supposed to last five years
330000	332000	I wonder, do some of those still work
332000	334000	I've never heard of those batteries really failing
334000	335000	My Zelda cartridge finally died
335000	336000	Did it really?
336000	337000	It did
337000	340000	Also, the same batteries, the lithium batteries are used in the Sega Saturn
340000	343000	Mine have had to be replaced a couple times
343000	345000	Wow
345000	348000	BlackWolf, plugging his other show in chat
348000	352000	We learned on Friday Night Gaming that blowing on the cartridge actually does nothing
352000	355000	It was the readjusting into the cartridge slot that fixed it
355000	359000	See, I always thought it was the moisture that you, when you were blowing on the cartridge
359000	361000	It was the moisture from your breath that was helping with the contacts
361000	362000	That's what I always thought was the
362000	363000	The moisture would corrode contact
363000	364000	Oh, interesting
364000	366000	We used to just take alcohol swabs
366000	370000	It all depends on how, what condition your console is in
370000	371000	You know, in your games
371000	373000	If you leave your games out and they're super dusty
373000	378000	Then blowing in it, I can imagine, would fix that a little bit
378000	381000	But yeah, usually it was the contacts on the inside that were really dirty
381000	384000	And thankfully they did have the NES cleaning kit
384000	389000	And you could, you know, do that and then you see the contacts and they come out all black and you're like, wow
389000	393000	One more comment from chat and then we'll get to how was your gaming week
393000	398000	We have Say in chat says, I've only ever had my PS1 break caught on fire
398000	403000	I can't, I would freak the hell out if that ever happened when a gaming system
403000	405000	Can you imagine a gaming system like catching fire?
405000	407000	Dude, what did you do with that system?
407000	409000	Was it like a 48 hour Final Fantasy 7 marathon or something?
409000	411000	Like how does your system catch fire?
411000	413000	Or maybe it wasn't properly vented, I don't know
413000	416000	But, you know, because some of those systems
416000	419000	Or he poured gasoline on it and set it on fire
419000	423000	I don't think that would be a, you know, whoops mistake
423000	424000	I don't know
424000	430000	Alright, let's, breaking these consoles in all these intricate ways makes me think back
430000	434000	Do you guys remember the SmashMyWee.com or whatever it was
434000	435000	I could be mistaken
435000	438000	Where they stood in line all night long to buy a Wii
438000	440000	Only so they could break it
440000	441000	Yeah, they'd be there all the time
441000	443000	The novelty is worn off
443000	445000	What a bunch of assholes, yeah the novelty is worn off
445000	447000	Now what they should do though
447000	449000	And I totally approve of this
449000	451000	Is like smash my scion or something
451000	454000	Something more expensive that it takes a while to smash this
454000	457000	You know, like you can actually do some serious damage to it
457000	462000	Because, you know, and what they do is get people to donate money so that they can go smash it
462000	466000	Why are we allowing these people to have the fun of smashing something
466000	469000	You know, I want to be able to smash something for free
469000	474000	Wow, and Sage just followed up in chat, it was some 24 hour thing
474000	476000	So, there you go
476000	478000	Alright, let's get to how was your gaming week
478000	482000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week, what kind of games did you play this week
482000	484000	I played Ragnarok online and that's about it
484000	486000	Getting back into the Ragnarok, huh
486000	493000	Off and on, I've really been spending a lot more time doing, reorganizing our video game collection at my house
493000	495000	Which is actually what my husband is doing right now
495000	498000	We have a lot of games, a lot of games
498000	501000	Didn't you upload some of the pictures to our picture feed, I thought
501000	505000	Just one of the stacks, and that's like a small part of the vault
505000	509000	We've actually moved out a lot of our boxes into the garage and are going through everything
509000	512000	And Dan found all of our Guilty Gear figures today
512000	516000	And a few Mega Drive cartridges and stuff
516000	517000	Awesome
517000	520000	I found our copy of Policenauts
520000	523000	Wow, that's random
523000	529000	Hey, I got a question, I haven't asked this in a while, what ever happened with Ragnarok 2, I haven't heard anything on that in a while
529000	530000	Did that ever like release
530000	531000	I don't care
531000	532000	You weren't a fan
532000	533000	Still in beta, I don't care
533000	536000	After all this time, it's been like beta for like two years
536000	539000	How long was the first Ragnarok in beta
539000	540000	I guess that's true
540000	542000	You played with me in the beta
542000	543000	I remember, yeah, it was a long time ago
543000	545000	With your mage with a bow
545000	551000	Deathwishing in chat at chat.org.com says Ragnarok is way too confusing
551000	553000	What do you think this guy is doing wrong
553000	555000	Maybe he didn't translate the game yet, I don't know
555000	557000	Is it confusing, is it hard to get into
557000	558000	Is it about Ragnarok 2 or the first one
558000	559000	No, the first one
559000	561000	The first one is not at all confusing
561000	563000	It's really easy
563000	570000	I mean, it's just a matter of using common sense and combining your skills and what matches what you want to do
570000	576000	If you want to be a fighter, you can either go strong, tough, or fast
576000	578000	But it's also a different kind of game, right
578000	582000	Because if you go to this game after playing something like, I don't know, Warcraft, it's different
582000	583000	It's easier
583000	587000	Ragnarok Online is infinitely easier than World of Warcraft
587000	598000	But the thing that I think that people don't like about it is that you don't have someone holding your hand and allocating your points for you
598000	604000	Maybe it's because they expect you to fucking use your brain to allocate your points
604000	605000	You know
605000	608000	Alright
608000	609000	Am I right or am I right?
609000	612000	It's been so long since I've played, I honestly can't tell you
612000	614000	I don't even remember how the damn game works
614000	616000	I remember the porings were really cute, that's what I remember
616000	617000	World of Warcraft
617000	621000	Well, I wouldn't say it necessarily hand holds you and how to distribute your point
621000	624000	But here's the thing, Warcraft is so infinitely popular
624000	628000	You can go onto websites upon websites to tell you how to build your character
628000	634000	And then you get these, you know, elitist raiders that if you don't shape your character a certain way, then you are suck
634000	637000	But in the end, it's all basically your armor
637000	640000	Or the stuff you've got on you that controls it
640000	644000	In Ragnarok, it's if you kill creature, creature, creature
644000	648000	You can go put all of it in your intelligence and have a mage, you know
648000	649000	Intelligence and dex
649000	652000	If you want, like say if you're playing an assassin
652000	656000	You put it all in your agility, a little bit in strength and a lot of it in dex
656000	659000	And boom, you can hit and hit a lot
659000	669000	So, you know, and on top of that, your armor and your accessories are all in addition to what you do
669000	673000	So it's not really that confusing, you just have to know what you want
673000	679000	Blackwolf in chat, if I wanted to use my brain, I wouldn't rot them away playing a video game
679000	681000	He says with a little hint of sarcasm
681000	684000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
684000	687000	I played loss and damage
687000	689000	And that's it
689000	694000	Just multiplayer, I didn't get around to doing much of anything
694000	697000	I'm trying to figure out why that was
697000	700000	Oh yeah, I remember now
700000	705000	Because I was trying to hack the loss and damage and it's fucking hard
705000	709000	So, yeah
709000	711000	So no luck there
711000	719000	Because apparently they have these SHA-1 hashes in a file
719000	724000	And if you change one byte of the file, it changes the whole hash
724000	730000	So you have to figure out where they need to be updated and for what blocks
730000	736000	It's so complicated that it just fries my brain thinking about it
736000	738000	But I want to do it because you can edit it just like the PC
738000	741000	Because it has the same format and stuff, so that'll be fun
741000	744000	But yeah, that's pretty much that
744000	749000	And then I did find my DS Lite finally
749000	752000	Buried amongst the stuff that was on my coffee table
752000	757000	And so I kind of went through there and I'm going to be playing some games on that now
757000	760000	So, hopefully I'll have a little bit more to play
760000	763000	And I know next week for sure I'm going to have some stuff to play
763000	769000	I'm getting from work a Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Killzone 2
769000	772000	Not that I'm really excited about it because I don't give a shit about Resident Evil
772000	774000	But I'll play it anyways or whatever
774000	777000	Killzone 2 looks interesting, I wasn't going to buy it though
777000	779000	So thank god I don't have to pay for it
779000	783000	But Mad World, holy shit, I can't wait to play that game
783000	785000	So that'll be one I'll be playing next week
785000	787000	But lots of fun stuff coming up
787000	792000	My gaming week, I didn't have time to play a whole lot
792000	795000	I did check out Quake Live for a brief little bit
795000	797000	Now that the queues apparently aren't such an issue
797000	799000	The first couple of days you try to get in there
799000	801000	You had these queues that were thousands of people long
801000	803000	It's just like, yeah right, you're not going to get in there
803000	805000	But finally I snuck in there one night and got to play
805000	807000	Because I think they finally eliminated the queues
807000	809000	Or really opened up the servers or something
809000	811000	Or the fever just died down, so it's really easy to get in there now
811000	813000	So I did play for a little bit
813000	816000	I was surprised because I don't know why
816000	820000	But I was under the impression that Quake Live was a new version of the original Quake
820000	822000	It's not, it's based off Quake 3
822000	826000	Even the same voice and all that stuff
826000	829000	So I was pleasantly surprised
829000	831000	I like how it does that skill match in the beginning
831000	832000	In the very beginning when you sign onto Quake Live
832000	834000	You have to play a 10 minute match against a computer opponent
834000	837000	That gets a little harder as you start kicking her butt
837000	840000	And then it gets a little easier if she starts killing you a lot
840000	842000	So it's supposed to skill match you with other opponents
842000	845000	So considering the whole thing is free
845000	847000	It's definitely worth checking out
847000	854000	If I suck really bad on that then I could play really hardcore against noobs
854000	856000	I would think so, but I would think that as you do that
856000	858000	Your skill rating is going to go up
858000	860000	So you don't get to do that for very long
860000	861000	I would imagine there's people
861000	863000	So I actually tried
863000	865000	Because I was thinking, oh I should just suck at this
865000	867000	So I can just get matched against really easy players
867000	868000	So I can feel better about myself
868000	871000	But then I thought no, because there's going to be a lot of other people thinking that same thing
871000	872000	So I'm going to just actually try
872000	874000	Because I know I'm not that great at Quake
874000	877000	And it was an even match between me and the computer opponent
877000	878000	So it was just kind of fun
878000	880000	And some comments from chat
880000	883000	Tigerclaw says, Quake Live also works in full screen
883000	886000	And that's true, Quake Live does run pretty well in full screen
886000	889000	Tigerclaw says, it's Quake 3 minus the blood and gore
889000	891000	Yeah, the blood's missing and all that stuff
891000	893000	But again, it's all free in the browser
893000	895000	It's very hard to complain
895000	898000	I had a good time with Quake Live
898000	899000	The little time I spent with it
899000	900000	I want to go back and revisit it
900000	902000	I also played some Rock Band 2
902000	903000	Because I love me some Rock Band
903000	905000	I spend an obscene amount of money on new songs
905000	907000	I don't know why I waste my money like that, but I do
907000	909000	I was like, oh, I have to play No Doubt and New
909000	911000	And I really want to play White Zombie
911000	913000	I have two drum sets and I use neither of them
913000	914000	Oh my gosh
914000	915000	Maybe I should borrow one
915000	916000	I need to get my drum achievements
916000	917000	I don't know
917000	920000	I've got one, it's the wireless one with the cymbals
920000	922000	I have the cymbals for it
922000	923000	Really?
923000	925000	Yeah, and they're kind of, eh
925000	926000	I might have to
926000	928000	And I have a drum bag, or a bag to carry the drums
928000	930000	I was thinking about getting that little portable one
930000	931000	I don't know how well they work
931000	933000	Don't get that
933000	934000	Is it terrible?
934000	935000	It looks like crap
935000	939000	Well, I don't know, but I like the idea that it doesn't take up all this freaking space in my house
939000	942000	You know, you kind of just put it out on the table and play
942000	944000	Seriously, if you got a bag for the drums
944000	946000	The one that they actually make for it
946000	948000	It doesn't take up that much space at all
948000	949000	It's like a small suitcase
949000	951000	And you can just put it down somewhere
951000	954000	I have my one set broken down in that
954000	957000	And then I have my other one that if I were to play Rock Band
957000	959000	I would use that set, but
959000	960000	They're both at work
960000	963000	So I don't, you know, because I've run out of space in my house
963000	965000	And here's the other thing
965000	967000	Also in my gaming week
967000	969000	I downloaded the demo for The Last Remnant
969000	970000	But I haven't checked it out yet, so
970000	971000	I don't know why I mentioned it
971000	973000	But I'm going to check that out this next week
973000	974000	Because I'm curious
974000	976000	If it's really, really good, I might just get it on 360
976000	978000	But I'm also kind of curious how it's going to run on PC
978000	980000	And then also
980000	983000	I wanted to go back and play Civilization 4
983000	986000	Because, you know, after video games live and everything
986000	987000	And seeing the little slideshow
987000	989000	I was like, oh, I need to get back into Civilization and play this game again
989000	991000	So I remembered it was on GameTap
991000	993000	So I went to GameTap and found it in their library
993000	995000	And tried to launch Civilization 4
995000	996000	It doesn't work
996000	997000	Because it doesn't work in Windows Vista
997000	1000000	And come to find out, quite a few of their games don't work in Windows Vista
1000000	1003000	Also come to find out, GameTap's going through some major changes
1003000	1004000	In the next couple weeks
1004000	1006000	As they kind of shift to their new ownership or whatever
1006000	1009000	Whatever, I got this email about new pricing arrangements or whatever
1009000	1012000	And, you know, I'm locked into their current ones
1012000	1014000	So I'm not going to get shifted or whatever
1014000	1016000	But I don't know if I really like the direction GameTap's heading
1016000	1017000	I have to be honest
1017000	1019000	You know, as a fair critic
1019000	1021000	I don't know if I necessarily like
1021000	1023000	And I can't really judge until it happens
1023000	1025000	But now they have this whole thing where the arcade games
1025000	1028000	Are going to actually be playable in the browser window
1028000	1030000	And, you know, some of the classic games
1030000	1032000	And now some of the other stuff
1032000	1034000	Like, they're kind of turning into this hybrid of Steam
1034000	1037000	And, like, what sounds to me like Pogo games
1037000	1039000	And, like, I don't want to pay for Pogo games
1039000	1040000	You know what I mean?
1040000	1041000	So, I don't know
1041000	1043000	I'm going to withhold my full judgement
1043000	1045000	Until it comes out
1045000	1047000	But, I don't know, I'm just not happy either
1047000	1049000	That, like, some of these things just won't work in Vista
1049000	1051000	And I understand the games are old
1051000	1053000	They were made for a certain Windows system
1053000	1055000	It's my fault for being stupid and having Vista
1055000	1057000	But, look, that's what my computer came with
1057000	1058000	So that's all I have
1058000	1060000	I keep seeing advertisements for good old gaming
1060000	1062000	It's a, I don't know if it's a website
1062000	1064000	It's like Steam or something
1064000	1067000	But they have, you know, older games in there advertising
1067000	1069000	Rise of the Triad on there and stuff
1069000	1071000	So I think that's kind of neat
1071000	1073000	That they have the old games
1073000	1075000	If they would run or not
1075000	1077000	Because I know Duke Nukem 3D, for example
1077000	1079000	Won't run on, you know, XP
1079000	1081000	Unless you've got, you know, something special for it
1081000	1083000	So, I don't know
1083000	1084000	Dr. Tetsuya in chat says
1084000	1086000	I agree, we haven't used it in a long time
1086000	1088000	Especially since they're all about PC ports nowadays
1088000	1090000	Now, you know, call me stupid if you want
1090000	1091000	I don't care
1091000	1092000	I made an impulse buy a few months ago
1092000	1094000	Not that you've ever made impulse buys, Loki
1094000	1096000	I bought a full year of GameTap up front
1096000	1098000	So I'm locked into this thing for a year
1098000	1099000	Whether I like it or not
1099000	1101000	So, at least, you know, I'll have a chance to give it a full review
1101000	1102000	And maybe it'll win me over
1102000	1104000	I just don't like what I'm hearing, that's all
1104000	1106000	So, you know, I kind of look at these changes
1106000	1108000	And I go, oh boy, alright, I'm going to have to see this in motion
1108000	1111000	But, you know, I guess in the end it is all about the games
1111000	1114000	And if they can make it so that Civ 4 will magically work in Windows Vista
1114000	1116000	I don't know what they have to do
1116000	1118000	I imagine if they emulate all these old games, there's got to be a way to do it
1118000	1121000	Civ 4 is not, like, an obscure game
1121000	1125000	Couldn't you run it, like, say in the compatibility mode with XP or something like that?
1125000	1127000	Run GameTap?
1127000	1129000	Possibly, I haven't looked into how it works
1129000	1130000	Oh, I finally got to
1130000	1132000	Maybe there's a listener that's thinking, Rob, you're so stupid
1132000	1134000	There is totally a way you get it to work in Windows Vista
1134000	1136000	But then again, shouldn't GameTap just kind of be able to tell me that?
1136000	1138000	How about compatibility mode?
1138000	1139000	I just said that
1139000	1140000	Yeah, I don't know
1140000	1142000	Well, I finally got to use Vista
1142000	1151000	Yeah, I had my wife's co-worker want me to find her some stuff to put onto her system
1151000	1153000	You know, all legit software, of course
1153000	1160000	So, I hate Vista. It sucks really bad
1160000	1163000	It's just, the hand-holding stuff really pisses me off
1163000	1165000	I disagree
1165000	1167000	I don't know, I'm iffy on it
1167000	1171000	These compatibility type issues make me a little irked with Vista
1171000	1173000	I think I'm more looking forward to the new Windows than I am
1173000	1176000	I'm kind of like, uh, Vista's a stepping stone for me
1176000	1177000	I don't like Vista now
1177000	1181000	My system is completely tailored around running it
1181000	1183000	So, that's just how it was when I bought it
1183000	1186000	So, it runs like a dream on my computer
1186000	1188000	Yeah, it's fast
1188000	1190000	I mean, on my computer, it's well optimized and everything
1190000	1192000	But it's just, I don't know
1192000	1195000	I disabled all the touchscreen stuff because it was fucking with my tablet
1195000	1198000	And I disabled a few things here and there
1198000	1201000	But then again, I've always tweaked XP to get it to run how I want it to
1201000	1205000	I tweak every OS I get my hands on to make it run the way I want it to
1205000	1210000	And guess what? Right now, my Vista runs like XP with a few goodies
1210000	1215000	But I bet you wouldn't be able to play Civ IV either
1215000	1217000	Actually, I probably would be able to
1217000	1219000	If you can get it to work, let me know
1219000	1224000	City of Heroes gave me compatibility issues and I just changed it to run in compatibility mode
1224000	1225000	And boom, no problem
1225000	1228000	I'll check it out, maybe it is something that simple and I'm just being stupid
1228000	1230000	All it did was change my resolution
1230000	1231000	That's certainly a possibility
1231000	1233000	And then it changes it back when it's done
1233000	1234000	Alright, we'll see
1234000	1235000	I'll try it, I'll try it
1235000	1237000	I'll try to dig into compatibility mode
1237000	1241000	And then I'll get all those emails this week, you idiot, it was super easy
1241000	1245000	And then GameTap will email me, you idiot, stop talking negative about our service and you can't figure it out
1245000	1247000	But at the same time, I would think
1247000	1250000	If GameTap is going to give me an error message about not being able to start the game
1250000	1253000	It should tell me, hey, you should think about running in compatibility mode
1253000	1256000	Of course it could have been right in front of my face and I was just too pissed off not to see it
1256000	1257000	Anyhow
1257000	1260000	Alright, let's get into
1260000	1263000	Yeah, next link in chat says I have Civ IV and I run it off Vista
1263000	1264000	So I don't know
1264000	1266000	Maybe I'm doing something wrong, we'll see
1266000	1270000	I can fully admit, look, I'm not the biggest computer genius in the world
1270000	1274000	I can just get Civ IV, you know, so that you could play it without GameTap
1274000	1277000	Maybe that's what I'll be forced to do
1277000	1279000	Because I will feel that sense of entitlement
1279000	1280000	That's right
1280000	1281000	Not stealing
1281000	1282000	GameTap forced you
1282000	1284000	They forced you into this, okay
1284000	1285000	Alright
1285000	1287000	Let's move on with the show
1287000	1289000	We have some housekeeping to get into
1289000	1291000	And then we're going to get into tonight's show
1291000	1296000	Hey, I'm over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com right now live tonight during the show
1296000	1300000	Orange Lounge Radio March Madness The Elite 8 is wrapping up right now
1300000	1302000	And check that out
1302000	1303000	You can vote
1303000	1306000	There's some pretty epic matchups going on in the top 8 right now
1306000	1309000	Final Fantasy VI vs Chrono Trigger
1309000	1311000	Before the show tonight, Chrono Trigger was leading
1311000	1313000	But, you know, a lot can change
1313000	1314000	That's a pretty epic matchup
1314000	1316000	So you can go vote in that
1316000	1319000	And the Final Four will be announced a little later tonight after the show
1319000	1323000	And keep an eye on OrangeLoungeRadio.com for that throughout the week
1323000	1327000	Also, we have some more people writing on OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1327000	1330000	And now we have some new segments that showed up out of the blue that I'm loving
1330000	1332000	I heart that song
1332000	1337000	They've actually kind of been, I guess, using the classic game of the week a little bit as an inspiration
1337000	1342000	Some of our staff writers have been writing these tributes to great songs in gaming
1342000	1343000	Which has been kind of cool
1343000	1346000	And, you know, just some other great segments on OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1346000	1349000	Very happy with the direction the new site's going
1349000	1351000	Alright, I guess that's it for housekeeping
1351000	1355000	Don't forget, you know, LiveJournal, Facebook, MySpace, all that good stuff
1355000	1358000	Let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki
1358000	1364000	Well, there's interesting stuff coming out from Microsoft
1364000	1371000	You may remember last year during August that they did the, what was it, Summer of Arcade
1371000	1376000	It was a promotion where they had a bunch of really cool arcade games coming out back to back
1376000	1381000	You know, each week there'd be a really highly anticipated Xbox Live Arcade game
1381000	1385000	Well, I don't know if this is exactly the same type of thing
1385000	1388000	But they're doing one that's going to start on March 18th
1388000	1390000	It's the Days of Arcade promotion
1390000	1393000	I don't know why they couldn't have done Spring of Arcade
1393000	1394000	But Days of Arcade
1394000	1398000	And similar to the event that happened last year
1398000	1401000	They're going to have a bunch of different games coming out
1401000	1404000	Starting with the release of Hasbro Family Game Night
1404000	1409000	And if I remember correctly, I think Hasbro Family Game Night is actually like five different games
1409000	1413000	Yeah, it is. It's like Sari and a bunch of the old classic games
1413000	1416000	So I don't know if on the 18th they're going to get like five games all of a sudden
1416000	1418000	But whatever
1418000	1422000	Also coming out will be the Dishwasher Dead Samurai
1422000	1426000	Which, if you remember, was that really kickass XNA game
1426000	1428000	Finally now an actual game
1428000	1433000	Flock, which was Capcom's kind of sheep herding type of game
1433000	1438000	Outrun Online Arcade, which is pretty awesome
1438000	1439000	Puzzle Quest Galact...
1439000	1440000	Like Old School Sega Outrun?
1440000	1442000	Yes, like Outrun
1442000	1444000	Could be fun
1444000	1446000	Puzzle Quest Galactrix
1446000	1448000	Uno Rush
1448000	1450000	And Lode Runner
1450000	1452000	Those all sound pretty awesome, actually
1452000	1456000	You know, I don't know though, I don't get the same thrill out of Hasbro Family Game Night
1456000	1458000	That I did out of like Geometry Wars 2
1458000	1460000	And some of the things that came out in the summer
1460000	1462000	But I understand
1462000	1468000	Xbox has a family friendly niche they need to fill pretty badly to compete with Nintendo
1468000	1470000	So I'm okay with it, I understand why they need stuff like that
1470000	1472000	It all depends on what games
1472000	1474000	I can't remember what they had in the Hasbro Family Game Night
1474000	1476000	If they actually had, you know...
1476000	1478000	Battleship might be fun
1478000	1482000	Well also look, what's like the number one Xbox Live Arcade game
1482000	1484000	After all this time, like Uno
1484000	1486000	Maybe not number one, I have nothing to back that up
1486000	1488000	But it's still like in the top five at least
1488000	1490000	After all this time, Uno is still there
1490000	1492000	You know, tons of people still play Uno
1492000	1495000	So you can't say that there's not a demand for something like this
1495000	1497000	Especially if it's well done, so you know
1497000	1501000	And the Hasbro Family Game Night sells really well in every other system that it's out on
1501000	1503000	So I can see that
1503000	1505000	Yeah, I can see it too
1505000	1508000	There's a lot of love being lavished upon Galaga Legion in our chat room
1508000	1511000	Son of Dad says Galaga Legion was the best last year
1511000	1513000	Sonic M88, I loved Galaga Legion
1513000	1515000	That was a pretty good release in the last batch too
1515000	1517000	No I didn't actually... I think I downloaded that
1517000	1519000	I'm not sure if I bought it or not, but
1519000	1522000	I downloaded it and played the demo, it was pretty cool
1522000	1525000	But that was like right around the same time that I also got Space Invaders Extreme on my PSP
1525000	1527000	And I just kind of ended up playing that instead
1527000	1529000	Yeah
1529000	1533000	I think didn't Duke Nukem 3D come out during that time too?
1533000	1534000	I think it did
1534000	1536000	Yeah, I think that was one of the big releases too
1536000	1538000	Yeah, that was another one like Doom where I was like
1538000	1540000	Oh my god, it's Doom!
1540000	1542000	And it played multiplayer online like once
1542000	1545000	And I was like, okay I'm going on to other things now
1545000	1548000	But aren't they making a Galaga Legion 2?
1548000	1550000	Didn't we have a story on the show a few weeks ago about that?
1550000	1551000	That they're doing a second one?
1551000	1552000	I don't know about that
1552000	1554000	Some type of other reiteration of Galaga?
1554000	1555000	I don't know
1555000	1557000	It would be pretty awesome if they did
1557000	1561000	Hey, the Xbox Elite is being phased out apparently
1561000	1563000	This is the rumor going around the internet this week
1563000	1566000	Apparently the Xbox 360 is going to be more of like a limited edition type of console
1566000	1568000	It's not going to be so readily available
1568000	1572000	It's because retailers are not as happy about the Elite apparently
1572000	1574000	You know, the economy the way it is
1574000	1577000	A system that costs what, $200 more than the entry level system
1577000	1579000	It's not doing too well
1579000	1583000	So apparently Microsoft might actually be limiting the console sales
1583000	1587000	To only select retailers across North America and Europe
1587000	1591000	Apparently the Elite might just phase out altogether in Quarter 2
1591000	1593000	Yeah, I don't know about that
1593000	1597000	I mean, at least as far as when I'm selling it
1597000	1599000	We have tons of it on hand
1599000	1601000	So it won't be going away anytime soon
1601000	1603000	But I know they do
1603000	1608000	And some thought is that maybe they're phasing this out in favor of
1608000	1612000	The Elites will be out for the Resident Evil 5 Red Box Elite system
1612000	1616000	And then when that phases away and the next big Xbox game comes out
1616000	1618000	There'll be a limited edition system for that
1618000	1623000	They could be treating it like Sony's doing with their higher end systems
1623000	1628000	Like the 160GB system now that's bundled with the game
1628000	1630000	They may be doing that
1630000	1635000	And I can see, because right now the Elite by itself doesn't seem like a great deal
1635000	1640000	But when you have the Resident Evil Elite there
1640000	1644000	You get an arcade game and you also get a game with it for the same price
1644000	1648000	So that seems a little bit better of a deal to me
1648000	1652000	And yeah, I can totally see them doing a Halo ODST game
1652000	1659000	And bundle and I don't know what other games they have coming out in the pipeline here
1659000	1663000	I know this is such a cliche bitch about the Xbox 360
1663000	1665000	But how about a quiet edition console?
1665000	1669000	I might pay an extra $100 for a freaking quiet Xbox 360
1669000	1671000	I mean, especially compared to the Playstation 3
1671000	1675000	Which, you know, obviously it has its own shortcomings
1675000	1677000	But one thing, it's freaking quiet
1677000	1679000	That's why you install games to your hard drive
1679000	1682000	Even when you do that, you still hear the vroom
1682000	1684000	You don't hear the drive spin up
1684000	1687000	But the machine itself is incredibly loud
1687000	1691000	Well, it's either that or it red rings on you because it overheats
1691000	1693000	Would you rather it be loud or would you rather it be dead?
1693000	1697000	I would rather they just fix the problem and redo the console or whatever
1697000	1701000	You know, Sony does it with the PS2 and the PS1
1701000	1704000	You can hack in there and manually change the voltage of your fan
1704000	1706000	I shouldn't have to hack
1706000	1707000	They should just do it
1707000	1711000	And then it'll be nice and cook food on it and stuff
1711000	1713000	I don't know
1713000	1715000	Open the case on it and take the fans out, I don't know
1715000	1717000	I don't want to break the damn thing
1717000	1719000	I just want it to shut the hell up sometimes
1719000	1721000	Because it's kind of loud
1721000	1726000	They should make a fan case that would go over the loudest parts
1726000	1730000	Or something, or a noise filter, I don't know
1730000	1735000	Maybe you should find some sort of noise trapping material
1735000	1737000	Like some sort of...
1737000	1741000	Like how metal would reflect a rubber mat or something
1741000	1743000	To put underneath it
1743000	1745000	Or maybe finding a different type of...
1745000	1748000	Some cabinets that you can put your systems in
1748000	1750000	Actually can put a glass window in front of it
1750000	1753000	With just the little thing for the cords and that kind of filters out the sound
1753000	1754000	I don't know
1754000	1757000	Or you get the integrated audio video setup
1757000	1759000	Where it's actually a plug in your wall
1759000	1761000	And you put another one in another room
1761000	1762000	And then you put your system in the other room
1762000	1765000	Since the wireless controllers can reach within 30 feet
1765000	1768000	Then you go, it's another room and you don't have to hear it
1768000	1770000	Or I could just fucking deal with it as I have to
1770000	1773000	Yes, that's definitely the way to go
1773000	1775000	But then I can't hear the game
1775000	1777000	Or I could get headphones
1777000	1779000	Yeah, that's another thing, headphones are good
1779000	1782000	Or you set it next to a PC that's even louder
1782000	1783000	And then it doesn't matter
1783000	1785000	Like the Orange Lounge Radio PC
1785000	1786000	Oh, that's nothing compared to...
1786000	1789000	I don't know if you can hear the monster fan on this thing
1789000	1791000	It is... I have the loudest...
1791000	1793000	Have you seen my PC?
1793000	1794000	Not in a long time
1794000	1797000	With its 200mm fan on top of it
1797000	1800000	And it's got like, you know
1800000	1803000	8 different fans that are on it
1803000	1805000	Plus there's 3 more inside the case
1805000	1807000	Plus there's a fan on each of the graphics cards
1807000	1811000	That are also hacked to be 100% all the time
1811000	1814000	It's like a jet engine
1814000	1816000	Alright, I don't want to bitch about noise anymore
1816000	1817000	People are probably sick of it
1817000	1818000	But I do want to read a comment from chatroom
1818000	1820000	Because this made me lull a little bit
1820000	1823000	The comment from chat was from SonOfDad
1823000	1827000	Says, Hannah Montana Xbox 360 Elite Skew for me please
1827000	1828000	PSP's doing it
1828000	1829000	There you go
1829000	1831000	Baby, baby poop purple
1831000	1833000	Xbox 360
1833000	1835000	If you want to join us in our chatroom
1835000	1836000	chat.orangeloungeradio.com
1836000	1839000	Well you know, Rob, that her new movie
1839000	1840000	She's gonna have to choose
1840000	1843000	Whether she's gonna be Miley Cyrus or Hannah Montana
1843000	1845000	How about she chooses to go jump in a lake
1845000	1846000	That would be...
1846000	1847000	Or deaf
1847000	1848000	She's deaf
1848000	1849000	Amazing
1849000	1850000	Alright
1850000	1854000	If I can't be both then I won't be any deaf
1854000	1856000	I'll just have to chop myself in half
1856000	1857000	Alright
1857000	1859000	Let's move on with more gaming news please
1859000	1862000	Do not let Loki ruin my show with Hannah Montana
1862000	1864000	Dear God no
1864000	1869000	Well how about something that I'm sure a lot of people have been waiting for
1869000	1871000	Rob, maybe you've been waiting for this, I don't know
1871000	1872000	What's that?
1872000	1875000	The Beatles on Rock Band
1875000	1877000	Actually it's the Beatles Rock Band Edition
1877000	1881000	A collaboration between Apple Corps, Harmonic, and MTV Games
1881000	1886000	And it's going to be all Beatles music
1886000	1892000	They're basically saying that they don't have any plans yet for downloadable content
1892000	1898000	But it is going to be stand alone, dedicated, just to the Beatles
1898000	1903000	So no importing your songs into other rock band games or any of that stuff is what it seems to imply
1903000	1905000	It's going to be all by itself
1905000	1908000	Which you know, it's the Beatles, they can do that
1908000	1910000	They're like the biggest band ever
1910000	1911000	Ever
1911000	1915000	And if you doubt this, of course I'm excited about a Beatles rock band game
1915000	1918000	I mean especially more so than some of these other bands
1918000	1921000	We've heard Metallica, Aerosmith, I'm sorry they're not the Beatles
1921000	1925000	They're good bands in their own way but I'm not as excited about that as the Beatles
1925000	1928000	Songs have lasted forever, sorry
1928000	1932000	Actually you're also going to be doing a limited edition premium bundle for $250
1932000	1936000	On all platforms, that would be Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii
1936000	1941000	That will have instruments modeled after the ones that the band actually played
1941000	1945000	So hey, that might mean Hofner bass
1945000	1947000	That's a little excessive for me
1947000	1953000	I wouldn't get it but I can see where collectors and hardcore Beatles fans would be all over that crap
1953000	1955000	So that's not a surprise
1955000	1956000	For me, I just want the game
1956000	1960000	But that's good for that audience, that they're doing something like that
1960000	1965000	But yeah, I think this game is going to be pretty epic in that regard
1965000	1967000	And if you doubt that the Beatles are still huge
1967000	1972000	One site I finally started using again this past week was last.fm
1972000	1974000	I know we have an Orange Islands Radio group on last.fm
1974000	1976000	If you haven't seen it, it's linked from our site
1976000	1979000	But I finally re-signed up for this site because I was trying to discover some new music
1979000	1983000	And if you look at the top bands that are played on last.fm
1983000	1985000	The Beatles are still there in the top ten
1985000	1988000	And that's all the music out of anywhere
1988000	1991000	So if you doubt that the Beatles are still huge
1991000	1992000	You're wrong
1992000	1994000	But Miley Cyrus is bigger
1994000	1995000	No, Miley Cyrus is not bigger
1995000	1997000	At least according to last.fm
1997000	2001000	Granted, not everybody on the planet uses last.fm
2001000	2002000	But it certainly
2002000	2009000	$250 seems an awful lot of money for, I don't know, Beatles rock band stuff
2009000	2013000	I mean, am I going to get part of some of the Beatles corpses in there?
2013000	2016000	Or the hair that you used to get, that they used to sell
2016000	2021000	No, I can understand why it's going to command a higher price
2021000	2022000	Because they can get away with it
2022000	2024000	There's going to be people that are willing to pay it for the Beatles
2024000	2026000	I just probably won't be one of them
2026000	2027000	But I'm still excited about the game
2027000	2035000	Did you hear the controversy on how people think that the Wii version is going to be $59.99 for just the software only?
2035000	2038000	They're like, $59.99? What the hell?
2038000	2040000	Everything is only $50!
2040000	2044000	That is the cap for Wii games
2044000	2047000	Not $59.99, it's $49.99
2047000	2049000	Says who?
2049000	2052000	Well, says the world
2052000	2053000	I don't know
2053000	2059000	I think back a long, long time ago on the Super Nintendo to when Street Fighter II came out
2059000	2061000	If I remember right, I could be wrong
2061000	2067000	But if I remember right, Street Fighter II when it first came out was like $79.99 on the Super Nintendo
2067000	2069000	That was, I mean, and this was years ago
2069000	2071000	This isn't counting for inflation, granted in the current economy
2071000	2073000	I think we're back to where we were when that game came out
2073000	2076000	But all that aside, you know, $79.99 was a lot of money
2076000	2079000	And it certainly was more money than you were seeing for other games at the time
2079000	2082000	I believe a lot of Super Nintendo games at the time were going for the $49.59
2082000	2086000	No, I think they were like $39 or $49 back then
2086000	2089000	But I remember Street Fighter II especially was very expensive
2089000	2090000	Maybe it was only $69.99
2090000	2092000	I just remember it was much more expensive
2092000	2094000	But it was Street Fighter II!
2094000	2097000	Who didn't want to buy that game back in that day when that first came out?
2097000	2100000	I honestly don't think it's going to come out for $59.99
2100000	2102000	I think that's actually a misprint
2102000	2105000	But whatever, people are going to stick with it for now
2105000	2107000	And they'll have a big controversy
2107000	2110000	But I don't see a lot of people picking it up for $60 if that's the case
2110000	2113000	Even if it is the Beatles, because who gives a shit?
2113000	2115000	It's the Beatles
2115000	2117000	I know I'm not picking it up
2117000	2119000	I don't give a shit about the Beatles, so whatever
2119000	2122000	A couple chatters are correcting saying it was $69.99
2122000	2124000	Maybe there's, I'm thinking like $70 in my mind
2124000	2127000	Rama says Sky at Toys R Us it was $69
2127000	2129000	Local Shops had it for $79
2129000	2131000	And Game Guru says it was $69.99
2131000	2133000	Son of Dad said it was $69.99 at KB Toys
2133000	2135000	I don't know how you guys remember that
2135000	2137000	Or if you just looked it up on the internet real quick
2137000	2141000	But still, still, they don't charge $69.99 for games now
2141000	2144000	I can't think of any games that aren't collector's editions that go for that price
2144000	2146000	So you know, I'm just saying
2146000	2148000	Who's to say they can't charge whatever they want for the game
2148000	2150000	If they know it's going to be in high demand
2150000	2152000	And that people are willing to pay that for
2152000	2154000	You know, what is arguably going to be a premium game
2154000	2156000	I mean it's not like we're talking about
2156000	2159000	You know, Carnival Games 2
2159000	2161000	Trying to command a price of $59.99
2161000	2164000	We're talking about the frickin' Beatles
2164000	2167000	So, you know, I don't know
2167000	2170000	I won't buy it for the Wii
2170000	2173000	Why are you talking crap about Carnival Games 2?
2173000	2174000	I don't know
2174000	2175000	I want to know
2175000	2176000	I'm not talking crap
2176000	2178000	I'm just saying I won't pay $69.99 for it
2178000	2182000	Carnival Games 2, it's worth that kind of money
2182000	2184000	Interesting comment from Marissa Cungusto in the chat
2184000	2186000	And I know that's the lovely Marissa
2186000	2187000	Who hasn't been on our show in a long time
2187000	2189000	But I think she needs to grace us with her presence again sometimes
2189000	2194000	True Beatles fans are more nuts about the music than gimmicks
2194000	2195000	But people do get nuts
2195000	2197000	Look at all the Elvis crap
2197000	2199000	Interesting perspective
2199000	2200000	Alright, let's move on
2200000	2203000	By the way, the release date of this game, 9-9-9
2203000	2206000	Ten years after the release of the Dreamcast
2206000	2209000	What a fun day to release stuff
2209000	2212000	And I believe, as I was hearing on a Bobby show earlier tonight
2212000	2213000	One of their chatters said something
2213000	2215000	Final Fantasy VIII was out on that same day too
2215000	2217000	So September 9th is a fun day
2217000	2218000	Really?
2218000	2219000	9-9-9
2219000	2221000	Final Fantasy VIII was out on that day too
2221000	2223000	No, I think it was out on September 9th of a different year
2223000	2225000	It's not the same
2225000	2227000	It's not quite the same
2227000	2231000	Anyways, so there's another rumor
2231000	2235000	Honestly, this isn't actually a rumor
2235000	2237000	I've seen it
2237000	2241000	Activision is preparing to release Guitar Hero Van Halen
2241000	2243000	Later this year
2243000	2245000	August, to be exact
2245000	2251000	And it will be coming out, of course, with some of the more popular Van Halen tracks
2251000	2254000	You know, Jump, Panama, Hot for Teacher
2254000	2258000	And also other bands' music are gonna be in there
2258000	2260000	Just like the Metallica stuff and Aerosmith
2260000	2263000	How can you have Jump without keyboards?
2263000	2264000	How?
2264000	2265000	I don't get that
2265000	2267000	How can you do that without keyboards?
2267000	2270000	I mean, I know, but I always thought of Jump as a keyboard song
2270000	2272000	In fact, there's a local store in town
2272000	2276000	I don't remember if it was Guitar Center or Skip's or one of those stores
2276000	2279000	You had the keyboards all on display at the store, right?
2279000	2282000	But they had these big songs that the following songs are banned
2282000	2285000	Do not play them on these keyboards or we will kick you out of the store
2285000	2286000	One of them was Jump
2286000	2289000	You couldn't play the chords
2289000	2291000	Like you couldn't play it, like that and for release
2291000	2292000	And all the other stuff
2292000	2294000	Like they would kick you out of the store if you played that
2294000	2296000	That's hilarious
2296000	2299000	It reminds me of that scene from Wayne's World
2299000	2301000	No stairway, tonight
2301000	2303000	Exactly, it totally reminded me of that
2303000	2306000	No stairway, denied
2306000	2310000	No chopsticks, I know chopsticks had to be one of them
2310000	2313000	Other stuff, other songs that might be in there as well
2313000	2316000	Juice Priest's Painkiller, Tenacious D's Master Exploder
2316000	2318000	Which you might remember was from Rock Band 2
2318000	2321000	And Weezer's Dope Nose
2321000	2325000	Of course, this is all to be taken as rumor right now
2325000	2327000	But no, it's not a rumor, it's actually coming out
2327000	2329000	It's gonna be just like Guitar Hero, Metallica
2329000	2331000	So expect that later on this year
2331000	2335000	However, that is not all that you can expect later on this year
2335000	2340000	Cause that's one of the millions of different Guitar Hero games that are coming out this year
2340000	2342000	Well actually Hero games
2342000	2348000	Including the previously announced Guitar Hero Modern Hits
2348000	2353000	Also supposedly this year, Guitar Hero 5 or whatever they're gonna call it
2353000	2360000	Band Hero, how that is any different than Guitar Hero 5 is beyond me
2360000	2366000	Another Guitar Hero on tour game for the DS and DJ Hero
2366000	2372000	I guess they weren't kidding when they were talking about the whole 5 Guitar Hero games in a year or something like that
2372000	2375000	I think it's a little overkill if you ask me
2375000	2379000	But I know I'm not buying any of these, except for DJ Hero maybe
2379000	2380000	That's a maybe
2380000	2383000	Marissa in chat again says it's true about Stairway, try playing it in Guitar Center
2383000	2387000	I don't doubt it, I'm sure they would get very angry at having to hear that song
2387000	2390000	It's just like I hear on American Idol, certain songs are banned from the auditions too
2390000	2394000	Like you can't sing Alicia Keys' Falling in your audition
2394000	2397000	I don't know why I know that, I must have read it on Wikipedia or something
2397000	2402000	Robert M on the last story makes it funny about the release date of the Beatles Rock Band game
2402000	2407000	The Beatles Rock Band release date, number 9, number 9, number 9
2407000	2409000	It's kind of a real nerdy joke there
2409000	2415000	It's also the same day as The Nine is released by Tim Burton
2415000	2417000	Which looks awesome
2417000	2418000	Is that a game or a movie?
2418000	2420000	It's going to be a movie and a game
2420000	2424000	Oh of course, I had to ask, of course if it's a big movie it's going to be a game as well
2424000	2427000	I thought the next Tim Burton movie was the Alice in Wonderland movie
2427000	2430000	No, the Nine is the next one
2430000	2433000	Unless Alice in Wonderland, I don't think Alice is coming out this year
2433000	2434000	No I think it's out in 2010
2434000	2438000	I love Alice in Wonderland and all that stuff, I'm really excited about the new movie
2438000	2440000	Anyway, more Guitar Hero
2440000	2444000	And this is a follow up to a story we reported on a couple, probably a few months ago at this point
2444000	2447000	I'm sure our FUs of the Week came right after this particular story
2447000	2450000	Do you remember when Gibson sued the makers of Guitar Hero?
2450000	2459000	That's right, Gibson had sued over the whole patent they had on musicians simulating participation in a concert
2459000	2463000	And all this stuff, like they tried to claim basically that they invented Guitar Hero
2463000	2466000	Even though Guitar Hero worked with them to make the controllers or what have you
2466000	2468000	Well guess what?
2468000	2472000	It was lost, their patent suit was lost
2472000	2476000	And essentially was practically laughed out of court
2476000	2478000	Is what happened with that
2478000	2483000	Let's see, this was from the US District Court for the Central District of California
2483000	2488000	Let's see, the court said it's toys that represent other items there
2488000	2495000	Also apparently Gibson's patent only originally applied to devices which use the analog audio signals
2495000	2498000	Not MIDI signals or any other types of control signals
2498000	2500000	So, there it is
2500000	2502000	Suck it Gibson
2502000	2507000	Yeah, it was a little bit silly of them in the first place as we discussed previously
2507000	2510000	But I guess you could say justice was served
2510000	2512000	I guess you could say they hacked the Gibson
2512000	2518000	Aha, aha, aha, give me that
2518000	2520000	Sad trombone
2520000	2526000	Well, while we're on the subject of the guitar games, whatever
2526000	2530000	Guitar Hero Greatest Hits will be out in June
2530000	2536000	And should have 48 songs, including Them Bones by Alice in Chains, Killer Queen
2536000	2541000	Killing in the Name, Through the Fire and the Flames
2541000	2549000	It's basically pulling songs from the other Guitar Hero games and putting them in one game
2549000	2554000	I guess the only cool thing about this is that now they're gonna get the band treatment
2554000	2559000	Like I was reading somewhere that Through the Fire and the Flames is supposed to have crazy hard drums on it
2559000	2561000	To match the crazy hard guitar part
2561000	2562000	But still
2562000	2564000	I wanna play the vocals for that
2564000	2568000	Still, if you listen carefully, listen carefully
2568000	2574000	And you might be able to hear the sounds of this franchise getting milked to death
2574000	2576000	Cause that's what's happening, I mean really
2576000	2578000	It's a slurping noise
2578000	2586000	That's like, okay, the other day I was looking on iTunes
2586000	2590000	And they have like greatest hits for like Wilson Phillips
2590000	2595000	Wilson Phillips had what, like two big songs and two CDs
2595000	2598000	Does this really necessitate a greatest hits album?
2598000	2601000	That's how I feel about this whole Guitar Hero thing
2601000	2605000	Is there really enough out there that necessitates this Guitar Hero Greatest Hits album?
2605000	2610000	How about this for more milking, Rob? It's gonna be out on Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, and PS2
2610000	2615000	I'm not surprised though, all the Guitar Hero stuff is milked on all the systems
2615000	2620000	But seriously, it's amazing, you go into stores now, like Fries and Best Buy
2620000	2624000	There's an entire aisle practically dedicated to these games now
2624000	2626000	And I mean it's because they sell, obviously
2626000	2630000	And because they're huge, like literally the boxes are huge
2630000	2633000	One day though, one day the bottom's gonna fall out from this market
2633000	2634000	It's gonna be kinda sad
2634000	2637000	And it's gonna be Activision's fault
2637000	2641000	Don't be like Konami, don't hoard DDR
2641000	2645000	I just, you know, again, at least bring a keyboard or something like that
2645000	2651000	And Rama says in chat, Sky, if Rick Astley can have a greatest hits album, so can Wilson Phillips
2651000	2653000	Good statement, good statement
2653000	2656000	That could possibly be the chat comment of the evening, we'll see
2656000	2659000	Alright, let's get into some release dates from around the world, lowkey
2659000	2664000	Alright, well in the US, we have a few games coming out this week

2678000	2681000	And features Mama from Cooking Mama
2681000	2684000	Except now she's working in a pet shop
2684000	2686000	Is there anything Mama can fix?
2686000	2687000	I don't want to know
2687000	2689000	I need Mama to fix my life
2689000	2694000	I don't know, maybe she's hunting for ingredients
2694000	2697000	We need Relationship Mama, that's what I need
2697000	2699000	I need Mama to fix my dating life

2808000	2813000	And finally Save the Best for Last, Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Xbox 360
2813000	2817000	And speaking of Xbox 360, you can get your limited edition
2817000	2821000	Red Xbox 360 Elite System
2821000	2825000	Some praise for Mad World in chat, Lazy Days, Mad World looks cool
2825000	2828000	Deep Man, can't wait for Mad World
2828000	2831000	It's nice to see a Wii game getting some fanboy lovin'
2831000	2832000	There you go
2832000	2837000	It's got John DiMaggio in it, I mean the voice of Bender
2837000	2843000	And Greg Proops from Whose Line doing sports commentary while you murder people with a chainsaw
2843000	2845000	What more do you want?
2845000	2846000	That's pretty amazing
2846000	2849000	I randomly met Greg Proops like years ago
2849000	2852000	It's nice to see that he still do it, because he had that game show
2852000	2854000	I met him right around the time he had that game show going on
2854000	2857000	And then that got cancelled, and then Whose Line wasn't on anymore
2857000	2859000	So I'm really glad to see he's around still
2859000	2861000	It's so awesome
2861000	2863000	Can't wait to play this game
2863000	2865000	You need to bring it over, I want to check it out
2865000	2869000	I don't know enough about this game, but you follow the chainsaw
2869000	2871000	It's like the Running Man meets Sin City
2871000	2874000	You follow those types of games better than I do, I will readily admit
2874000	2878000	Anyhow, let's move over to Japan and check out the Japanese release dates
2878000	2880000	I'm being distracted though with pictures
2880000	2882000	The Dark Sakura is showing me of her old cosplay
2882000	2885000	I actually found a lot of old photos that I'm actually sorting through
2885000	2887000	And going to throw away the really bad ones
2887000	2890000	But I just found my pictures that I took at a cemetery in Alabama
2890000	2894000	There was one of you cosplaying as Emi though, I thought that one was really cute
2894000	2898000	This particular photo that I will go and put on the camera in a second
2898000	2901000	Is from the Churchreach Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama
2901000	2904000	Of the only Revolutionary War veteran buried there
2904000	2907000	So that means that he had to have been listed when he was 15
2907000	2911000	Lots of love for Greg Proops in our chatroom apparently
2911000	2913000	That's awesome!
2913000	2915000	We should try to get him on the show or something
2915000	2919000	Nah, I don't know about that, that's like stretching the boundaries of you
2919000	2921000	Well, why not?
2921000	2924000	He's a voice actor in a video game, maybe he wants to sell the game
2924000	2927000	If the game does well, he'll want him back for a sequel
2927000	2929000	You never know
2929000	2931000	Alright, anyway, forget it
2931000	2933000	Let's move on to some Japanese release dates
2933000	2936000	Coming out in Japan, of course since we're getting it over here
2936000	2941000	You know Japan's gonna be getting Resident Evil 5 over there
2941000	2944000	Actually, I think that just came out this last week
2944000	2945000	Yeah, it came out last week
2945000	2947000	But, they are getting, I know this is new
2947000	2950000	The Idolmaster Twins is new on the Xbox 360
2950000	2953000	Idolmaster is a pretty big franchise over there
2953000	2955000	And now it's got twins
2955000	2958000	So, on the Playstation 3, Army of Two gets a price reduction

2993000	2996000	Wii Cheer gets its release in Japan this week as well
2996000	2998000	Because I know you guys can't wait for a Wii Cheer over there
2998000	3003000	And Boku to Sim no Machi Party comes out as well from EA
3003000	3004000	My Sims Party
3004000	3005000	Is this My Sims Party?
3005000	3006000	Yeah
3006000	3008000	That is, that is
3008000	3012000	Also coming out on the Playstation 2, Galaxy Angel 2
3012000	3014000	Need for Speed Pro Street getting a reduction
3014000	3017000	And that's it for the Playstation 2 this week
3017000	3019000	Let's look at the handhelds real quick on the Nintendo DS
3019000	3024000	Tokumiki Memorial Girls' Side First Love Plus comes out from Konami this week
3024000	3028000	Also coming out from Konami, or I'm sorry, a price reduction for Survival Kids
3028000	3032000	Also coming out Konami Dual Spirits, the DS game
3032000	3035000	Actually that's another price reduction, I was going to say that game's been out a while

3057000	3061000	Resistance Restribution also coming out on the PSP this week
3061000	3066000	And that looks to be about it, unless you're looking for a price reduction on Need for Speed Pro Street
3066000	3069000	So that's it for the Japanese release dates
3069000	3074000	Well how about some UK release dates, as soon as I set my photos down
3074000	3076000	Sure, let me read a quick chat comment while you're doing your photos
3076000	3083000	AcidicVampire in chat says, when I play Wii Cheer, I actually attach streamers to my Wiimote to make them feel like real pom poms
3083000	3089000	You joke, you joke, but they sell those things for the Wiis
3089000	3092000	I was going to say, I'm surprised they don't sell those
3092000	3098000	No, they do sell those, they sell Wii pom pom attachments for your damn remotes
3098000	3101000	Yes, people are that retarded
3101000	3104000	I kind of want one for some reason, but I'm going to make mine
3104000	3108000	Well remember, you can use it for every game, so you know
3108000	3113000	Because I want to play MadWorld with my pom poms, yay, go cheer, cut you in half
3113000	3115000	That's hilarious
3115000	3118000	I'll put this on the camera in a moment or if you want to do it for me
3118000	3120000	This cat is 27 years old
3120000	3122000	Oh my heck, alright, get to the release dates
3122000	3125000	Okay, let me give you the photo, his name is Sean
3125000	3127000	That's my cat from Alabama
3127000	3130000	Anyway, coming out on
3130000	3133000	I think he's a zombie
3133000	3137000	That's the only way we can explain that he's lived that long
3137000	3139000	He's alive by the power of evil
3139000	3143000	I've already said last week on the 8th and 9th that Flock was out
3143000	3148000	The 10th, Tomb Raider, Underworld, Lara's Shadow on Xbox 360
3148000	3154000	Bleach Dark Souls, Codename Panzer's Cold War on PC, Persona 4
3154000	3156000	Oh, by the way, those last few were on the 13th
3156000	3160000	Resident Evil 5 on the 13th, Resistance Retribution
3160000	3167000	Ocom, Frontation, Sonic and the Black Knight, Tom Clancy's Hawks on PC
3167000	3169000	Cool
3169000	3172000	Tigerclaw just linked in chat
3172000	3179000	Sorry, I just saw a picture of those stupid attachments
3179000	3184000	Oh god, I almost want them just for the sheer gayness of it
3184000	3186000	I feel like I need to own it
3186000	3189000	I don't know what it is, but I'm just compelled to purchase it
3189000	3191000	Even though it only has a 1.5 star rating
3191000	3198000	Dude, $19.99 for two little pieces of plastic that you tape on to the ends of your Wiimotes
3198000	3199000	That's amazing
3199000	3203000	We finally got a SKU for the Wii Music Instruments
3203000	3205000	They have attachments for all those too
3205000	3209000	So you can look like a douchebag playing those
3209000	3211000	I want to point out, Amazon looks like they're having a sale
3211000	3215000	You can get that and a Wii Cheer and All Star Cheer Squad
3215000	3221000	Play together $84.97 for the Ultimate Cheerleader Pack
3221000	3223000	Oh god, alright
3223000	3225000	Waaaaaame
3225000	3229000	Anyways, there's going to be a new Pac-Man game on the way
3229000	3233000	This is to celebrate the game's 30th anniversary
3233000	3237000	Good lord, you know, I remember just a few years ago when we were at E3
3237000	3239000	when they were celebrating the 25th anniversary
3239000	3245000	Now, of course, the 30th anniversary will become 2010
3245000	3247000	So, not surprising there
3247000	3251000	And, no word on exactly what it is
3251000	3259000	I guess Namco Bandai, America's Makoto Iwai
3259000	3263000	said, as a group, we feel that we should do something to make him come back
3263000	3267000	So there's one project that we've started working on
3267000	3273000	And I guess Yasu Hara is part of it
3273000	3279000	And says the new game design was sort of meeting his wish 100%
3279000	3283000	So, I have no idea what the hell that means, but it's going to be a Pac-Man game
3283000	3287000	So, set your expectations low
3287000	3289000	Well, I mean, the last Pac-Man game that came out was really awesome
3289000	3291000	Pac-Man Championship Edition is pretty great
3291000	3293000	Even Pac-Man Versus was pretty fun too
3293000	3296000	But, yeah, I mean, not every Pac-Man game has been a winner
3296000	3298000	It's Pac-Man, I mean, it's like
3298000	3304000	If Pac-Man ran faster, we'd be having the same problem as Sonic
3304000	3309000	But, uh, I'm kind of curious to see how they're going to reinvent Pac-Man
3309000	3312000	There are Pac-Pics, that seemed like a good idea
3312000	3313000	I love Pac-Pics
3313000	3316000	Until you played it, then you're like, wow, this sucks
3316000	3320000	Yeah, Pac-Pics, it was one of those things that was neat in a small dose
3320000	3323000	Like, it was a great demo to show the DS off with
3323000	3328000	But, as a game, eh, nah, didn't hold my attention
3328000	3330000	Pac could roll, that was kind of lame
3330000	3333000	You know what, Pac-Man, that Pac-Pics game
3333000	3335000	Like, you know how they're doing this DSI download service
3335000	3337000	Where games are only going to be a couple of bucks
3337000	3339000	You know, their whole little digital distribution thing
3339000	3343000	Pac-Pics would have been a great candidate for, like, a little $5 game there
3343000	3345000	That would have been, I think, where it would have been best served
3345000	3348000	But, obviously, they didn't have that at the time, so whatever
3348000	3349000	Um, anyhow
3349000	3351000	Just found a picture of Jason
3351000	3353000	What? Our webmaster Jason?
3353000	3355000	How old are these pictures? What are these all from?
3355000	3358000	E3, O, almost
3358000	3359000	O4, probably, right?
3359000	3362000	Yeah, I found a really bad picture of us
3362000	3363000	Oh, boy
3363000	3364000	Oh, I remember that picture
3364000	3365000	That's blurry
3365000	3366000	I look cute
3366000	3369000	Alright, hey, talking about pictures makes for great radio, doesn't it?
3369000	3371000	Hey, uh, Konami
3371000	3375000	You know our friends at Konami, they are turning 40 years old this week
3375000	3376000	If you can believe it
3376000	3377000	You're over the hill!
3377000	3379000	Congratulations, Konami, you're old
3379000	3381000	No, Konami has officially turned 40 this week
3381000	3385000	And, uh, quoting on the age of the company and how they did it
3385000	3388000	The European president, Kuno Nio, says
3388000	3392000	Consistency plays a major part in everything Konami does
3392000	3394000	I don't know if that means, you know, rehashing their games over and over
3394000	3395000	No, I'm kidding
3395000	3398000	Obviously, Konami's put out a lot of great games that we've loved very much over the years
3398000	3400000	So, there you have it
3400000	3404000	Konami also promises that there are a wealth of other new titles in development
3404000	3410000	By the way, a game that I left out of my gaming week was the DDR on the iPhone
3410000	3412000	Was a game that I actually played this week, the brand new one
3412000	3414000	They have DDR on iPhone now
3414000	3416000	Um, it's alright
3416000	3419000	You know, considering it's DDR on your iPhone
3419000	3421000	I mean, you don't actually dance
3421000	3422000	But, um, here's the thing
3422000	3424000	There's this new mode they have called shake mode
3424000	3429000	Where you actually play DDR by tilting your iPhone to the left and to the right and up and back
3429000	3431000	You know, which is kind of stupid but cute
3431000	3433000	But here's the weird thing
3433000	3436000	You only can play the tutorial song in shake mode
3436000	3438000	Like, is that a bug? Seriously?
3438000	3441000	Like, you were only meant to play the tutorial song and nothing else?
3441000	3443000	Like, did somebody forget to put that pointer in that says
3443000	3447000	Oh, after the tutorial, go back to the song select and not the main menu
3447000	3449000	So, I don't know
3449000	3451000	A little strange
3451000	3454000	But, the game has a lot of songs, I guess
3454000	3456000	You know, it's got like 26 songs or something like that
3456000	3458000	But you only have like 9 to start
3458000	3462000	You have to unlock them all slowly but surely
3462000	3465000	And I don't know, I hope there's an unlock code or something
3465000	3469000	Because I don't know if I can stand to just play these songs over and over again on the iPhone
3469000	3473000	But, you know, it is a lot of newer DDR songs
3473000	3475000	There's some old ass stuff mixed in there
3475000	3477000	But here's the thing that surprised me most
3477000	3480000	Did you know Brilliant To You now has a vocal version?
3480000	3482000	It's kind of scary
3482000	3483000	That's all I have to say
3483000	3485000	Like, I've been out of the DDR loop for so long
3485000	3489000	I had no idea there was a Brilliant To You now with vocals
3489000	3491000	Is it voluntary singing?
3491000	3492000	No, it's not voluntary, it's a dude
3492000	3494000	Or is it that really awful dude that like
3494000	3497000	What was it, did that crappy rap that was in uh
3497000	3499000	It could very well be for all I know
3499000	3501000	But, yeah, there's
3501000	3504000	You know, DDR music is interesting now
3504000	3506000	It's, you know, back in my day
3506000	3508000	It was a lot different
3508000	3510000	Getting these kids off your damn lawn?
3510000	3513000	Although, there was a Naoki and Smile DK song that was kind of cool
3513000	3515000	Because like, hey, Smile DK, you know
3515000	3518000	They kind of weren't around in Bamani for a long, long time
3518000	3520000	Well, there is
3520000	3522000	There is new DDR coming out
3522000	3523000	Like, later this month
3523000	3525000	Yeah, there's the, what, Hottest Party 2?
3525000	3527000	No, it's Disney Grooves
3527000	3529000	That's right, the DDR Disney
3529000	3532000	I keep getting emails about another one too that's still in development
3532000	3533000	I thought it was another Hottest Party game
3533000	3536000	No, well, I'm sure there will be another Hottest Party game of me
3536000	3538000	Because they keep putting that crap out
3538000	3540000	I don't know, it's just
3540000	3544000	Can't be excited about this stuff anymore
3544000	3548000	I will be more excited about DDR when there's something that's really reinvented it
3548000	3550000	You know, I don't know, even just going to different versions of music
3550000	3553000	I have a way to do it, but no one wants to give me the money to do it
3553000	3555000	I know
3555000	3557000	Alright, let's move on, some more gaming news
3557000	3561000	Enough reminiscing about the past 40 years of Konami
3561000	3564000	But, but, but, but, but we like the past
3564000	3566000	Yeah, that's true, and I think back to the Konami of the 80s
3566000	3568000	The old school Metal Gear game was amazing
3568000	3569000	But anyway
3569000	3573000	Well, how about some different news
3573000	3578000	Ubisoft has actually pulled a game called I Am Alive
3578000	3580000	That's being developed by Darkworks
3580000	3582000	From their lineup
3582000	3585000	They announced it at E3 that they wanted to release it
3585000	3589000	This spring, but it's actually been delayed until March 2010
3589000	3594000	Because it's apparently such an ambitious title that they want to do it justice
3594000	3596000	So, let's hope so
3596000	3598000	It was funny though, actually they announced it
3598000	3600000	Yeah, it's coming out in March
3600000	3603000	And they're like, uh, yeah, about that
3603000	3606000	It's actually financial year 2010
3606000	3608000	Oopsie
3608000	3611000	We jumped the gun there
3611000	3613000	So, sometime between now and March
3613000	3615000	Sweet
3615000	3619000	Anyways, there's something else that's kind of interesting
3619000	3621000	You remember we talked a little bit about it
3621000	3624000	That Square Enix was starting to buy up some shares of Eidos
3624000	3629000	Well, Square Enix is hoping to finish buying the rest of Eidos by May
3629000	3636000	And they're actually expected to approve a deal with the Eidos shareholders
3636000	3637000	Later this month
3637000	3643000	And hopefully by May 6th
3643000	3647000	There will be, I don't know
3647000	3651000	I guess they'll be under the ownership of Square Enix
3651000	3653000	That's kind of interesting though
3653000	3656000	Because my thoughts are, why would you want Eidos?
3656000	3660000	I mean, really, it's Eidos
3660000	3662000	Well, they do own Tomb Raider rights
3662000	3664000	And there's a new Tomb Raider movie coming out
3664000	3668000	So maybe they're going to try and do a different type of Tomb Raider game for it
3668000	3669000	I don't know
3669000	3671000	Maybe try to reboot some of the franchises
3671000	3674000	Doesn't Eidos also have, uh, is it Hitman that they have?
3674000	3675000	Yeah
3675000	3676000	That was another big one they have
3676000	3678000	You know, that was a fairly successful number one movie
3678000	3679000	I suppose
3679000	3681000	They have some big franchises that just need a swift kick in the butt
3681000	3683000	Well, maybe they can just pick up this company
3683000	3686000	So that they can just develop straight RPGs for, you know
3686000	3687000	From Square Enix
3687000	3689000	And they all have to worry about branching out into other games
3689000	3692000	Because they can have Eidos do the other game genres
3692000	3694000	Now what are we going to call them?
3694000	3697000	Game Guru in our chat room suggests Squeenix Titos
3697000	3699000	You know, here's funny though
3699000	3701000	They actually had it on this article here
3701000	3704000	It's Square Idocs
3704000	3706000	Game Guru in chat says
3706000	3709000	Square Enix wants franchises that aren't JRPGs
3709000	3711000	And that could be, you know, there has been those stories
3711000	3715000	About they want to get more into, you know, the more American style of the game development
3715000	3717000	So why not?
3717000	3721000	Yeah, but I mean, this is about like half a step from, you know
3721000	3723000	Buying out Atari or something
3723000	3725000	I mean, no offense, it's just like
3725000	3727000	Eidos is not what they used to be
3727000	3729000	Tomb Raider is definitely not what it used to be
3729000	3732000	And, you know, there are other franchises, you know
3732000	3735000	The ones that they still put out aren't what they used to be
3735000	3737000	And they haven't been really that great
3737000	3739000	Well, they obviously see something in it that maybe they can turn around
3739000	3741000	Maybe that's why they're able to buy them out
3741000	3743000	Because the shares are so low
3743000	3745000	I don't know, it's just
3745000	3749000	Whatever, I mean, if you're Square and you've got lots of money then
3749000	3753000	I guess it's fine to buy out Eidos
3753000	3757000	Well, hey, this game company seems to be doing something right
3757000	3761000	Because apparently, according to Nintendo Power's recent issue
3761000	3764000	A boy and his blob is coming back on the Wii pretty soon
3764000	3767000	That's kind of cool, this is coming from WayForward
3767000	3769000	Is the company that's making this game
3769000	3771000	Now, you might remember a little while ago
3771000	3773000	They were kind of testing this on the DS
3773000	3776000	There was a DS version of the game that was under development
3776000	3777000	But then it ended up getting cancelled
3777000	3779000	I remember playing this at E3 going like
3779000	3780000	Wow, it's a boy and his blob
3780000	3782000	But now, apparently
3782000	3784000	It's going to be reinvented on the Wii
3784000	3787000	And there's more information in this month's Nintendo Power magazine
3787000	3788000	So that could be interesting
3788000	3789000	Remember a boy and his blob?
3789000	3790000	Yes
3790000	3791000	It's kind of a neat game
3791000	3792000	A little bit of a short game
3792000	3793000	But, you know, back on the NES
3793000	3794000	It was kind of okay
3794000	3796000	Because it took a long time to figure out how to beat it
3796000	3797000	And get a cheat guide
3797000	3798000	But this could be kind of cool
3798000	3801000	I don't think it's a remake of the first game though
3801000	3803000	I think it's probably a whole new thing
3803000	3805000	But it definitely was an interesting concept
3805000	3808000	If you don't remember what a boy and his blob was
3808000	3810000	Basically, it was kind of a puzzle game
3810000	3811000	You had the blob and you were the boy
3811000	3813000	And you could walk around and the little blob would follow you
3813000	3816000	And if you fed the blob different flavors of jelly beans
3816000	3819000	Then the blob would turn into different objects
3819000	3820000	Like the blob could turn into a ladder
3820000	3822000	The blob could turn into a trampoline
3822000	3823000	Or a key
3823000	3826000	You know, it would just basically shape shift all these different things
3826000	3827000	So you were kind of
3827000	3828000	It was a puzzle game basically
3828000	3831000	And you really had just enough jelly beans
3831000	3833000	To figure out the answer to the puzzle
3833000	3835000	And get to the exit or whatever it was you were doing
3835000	3838000	So, it could be interesting to see how this plays out
3838000	3841000	In, you know, many many years later
3841000	3844000	Or what, probably like 20 years since this game was first out
3844000	3846000	It does look really cool that it's all hand drawn
3846000	3848000	Yeah, that could be very cool
3848000	3849000	So
3849000	3852000	Hitstun in chat points out the way forward also made Contra 4
3852000	3853000	So
3853000	3855000	Dark Tetsuya asks about the brick wall trick
3855000	3856000	No, I don't remember that
3856000	3858000	I do seem to remember there was a really easy way you could cheat
3858000	3861000	In Boy and His Blobs, that must be what he's talking about
3861000	3862000	So
3862000	3864000	Dan Shadow asks, is Jelly Belly paying for this?
3864000	3866000	I don't know, it could be a good sponsorship
3866000	3867000	I love Jelly Bellys
3867000	3870000	No, they have Jelly Belly ballistic beans
3870000	3872000	Do they really have a game like that?
3872000	3874000	They have a game that's coming out in April
3874000	3876000	In April or May
3876000	3878000	It's Jelly Belly ballistic beans
3878000	3879000	It's like, um
3879000	3881000	Bust a move
3881000	3882000	Um
3882000	3883000	You know, the
3883000	3885000	Puzzle Bobble type of game
3885000	3887000	Um, you know Jelly Belly
3887000	3889000	Doesn't make the Harry Potter beans anymore
3889000	3892000	They, uh, I guess lost the licensing agreement with that
3892000	3895000	So now they have their own, like, sad flavor of Jelly Beans lined
3895000	3897000	Like, have you ever had those nasty Jelly Bellys?
3897000	3900000	Like in the, you know, vomit flavor and all that stuff?
3900000	3901000	Blah
3901000	3902000	I love Jelly Bellys
3902000	3903000	Anyway, alright
3903000	3906000	Sorry, I guess the Boy and His Blob story is making me hungry
3906000	3908000	Uh, we're almost to a little break here
3908000	3909000	If you are craving food
3909000	3911000	We just have a few more stories to get through
3911000	3912000	And then we're gonna be taking a break
3912000	3914000	And of course we also have the classic game of the week
3914000	3916000	Which we'll be getting to in just a little bit
3916000	3917000	After a few more stories
3917000	3919000	Right, Dark Sakura?
3919000	3921000	Right, Rob!
3921000	3922000	Hey, hey
3922000	3923000	I actually just saw something that made me laugh
3923000	3924000	That I'm gonna post in the chat room
3924000	3926000	And what is that, may I ask?
3926000	3927000	Here, look for yourself
3927000	3928000	Okay
3928000	3930000	Hold on, let's see
3930000	3934000	Someone did a parody of what the Watchmen ending was gonna be like
3934000	3936000	Oh, is this gonna spoil the actual movie?
3936000	3937000	Cause I haven't seen it yet
3937000	3938000	No, Rob, it won't
3938000	3939000	Hahaha
3939000	3941000	Candy Mountain
3941000	3942000	Yeah
3942000	3943000	Nice
3943000	3944000	Okay
3944000	3945000	That's fantastic
3945000	3946000	Sorry, that's terrible radio
3946000	3947000	It's bas- nevermind
3947000	3949000	At least our live listeners can look at that
3949000	3951000	Anyway, um
3951000	3953000	How about some UK Virtual Console stuff?
3953000	3955000	And this makes me happy
3955000	3956000	It's fun stuff
3956000	3958000	It's Clu Clu Land!
3958000	3960000	We remember Clu Clu Land
3960000	3963000	I do, I remember playing it in Animal Crossing on the GameCube
3963000	3967000	Yep, and I played it on the Nintendo when it was new
3967000	3968000	Back in the day
3968000	3973000	Um, basically you just have to turn bubbles and make gems and stuff
3973000	3975000	And it's 500 Wii Points
3975000	3977000	And then Mega Drive title
3977000	3980000	Wonder Boy 3 Monster Lair
3980000	3982000	So, um
3982000	3985000	Which I think as we got it was Wonder Boy Monster Land
3985000	3989000	I think we just got that on Virtual Console ourselves over here too
3989000	3990000	Yeah
3990000	3991000	That's 800 Wii Points
3991000	3993000	So, go get em!
3995000	3996000	Go get em!
3996000	4000000	280 games for the Virtual Console available now
4000000	4003000	Yeah, then I'm not interested in any
4003000	4004000	Oh my god
4004000	4005000	Unfortunately
4005000	4006000	That's a lot
4006000	4007000	Still no Guardian Legend
4007000	4008000	You wanna know what?
4008000	4010000	I probably have that many in the vault
4010000	4012000	I wish I was joking
4012000	4014000	No, I wouldn't doubt it
4014000	4016000	It's just, you know, a lot of
4016000	4018000	I probably have that many ROMs, no I'm kidding
4018000	4020000	You know kinda why I wish I was joking?
4020000	4021000	Why?
4021000	4022000	Cause we're sorting them all
4022000	4023000	Fun
4023000	4024000	Lord
4024000	4025000	You need to get some big plastic bins
4025000	4027000	We got em actually
4027000	4031000	Well, while I may not be interested in
4031000	4032000	The Virtual Console
4032000	4035000	I am interested in something else that's coming out on the Wii
4035000	4037000	That would be Excitebots Trick Racing
4037000	4039000	And we actually got some details on it
4039000	4041000	Other than just a name now
4041000	4045000	We have pictures of the box art that came out
4045000	4047000	Which looks interesting
4047000	4050000	Which was promptly stolen and put all around the rest of the internet
4050000	4052000	Yeah, because I don't give a shit
4052000	4053000	So, whatever
4053000	4055000	So anyways, yeah, box art
4055000	4057000	Which shows robotic animals
4057000	4061000	Yeah, with wheels and stuff
4061000	4062000	That's kinda neat
4062000	4064000	Another interesting stuff
4064000	4066000	Before I was kinda worried
4066000	4069000	The description made it sound like a party game and stuff
4069000	4070000	It actually looks like Excite Truck
4070000	4072000	And it looks pretty sweet
4072000	4074000	Although there is weird stuff in there
4074000	4080000	Like there's a robotic turtle carrying a tambourine for some reason
4080000	4082000	And I'm not sure why
4082000	4086000	And then there's some other stuff that I saw with like
4086000	4089000	Throwing pies at clowns and stuff like that
4089000	4090000	So that's weird
4090000	4092000	But it's still Excite Truck
4092000	4094000	Can I throw rocks at clowns?
4094000	4096000	No, just pies
4096000	4097000	But they're big pies
4097000	4099000	But it's just
4099000	4100000	They're rock pies?
4100000	4102000	No, they're big pies
4102000	4104000	But the game basically plays very similar to Excite Truck
4104000	4106000	It's based on a star system
4106000	4108000	Not necessarily
4108000	4110000	You can get in first place
4110000	4111000	Obviously helps you
4111000	4113000	But if you don't get in first place
4113000	4114000	It doesn't really matter
4114000	4116000	Because it's all about who has the most star points
4116000	4118000	At the end of the race
4118000	4120000	And you get points for doing different things like
4120000	4122000	Tree runs
4122000	4124000	Catching air, doing air tricks
4124000	4126000	Jumps, whatnot
4126000	4128000	So very similar to Excite Truck
4128000	4131000	The controls are going to be exactly the same
4131000	4133000	And they've added a few different things in there as well
4133000	4135000	Now they have these new energy poles
4135000	4137000	That you can swing around
4137000	4139000	And gain a boost off of that
4139000	4141000	Lots of fun stuff
4141000	4143000	And then there's also some other game modes in there as well
4143000	4145000	Hopefully optional
4145000	4147000	That you can play poker by
4147000	4149000	Driving through cards
4149000	4151000	Based on what you get
4151000	4153000	You get points on the hands
4153000	4155000	And then also the clown thing
4155000	4157000	Which I don't know how that plays
4157000	4159000	But you basically throw a pie at a clown
4159000	4161000	As you're driving around
4161000	4163000	Nonetheless
4163000	4165000	It looks interesting
4165000	4167000	They've got vehicles flying through the air
4167000	4169000	And stuff like that
4169000	4171000	Plus you get a power up where your character
4171000	4173000	Is able to run with its legs and stuff
4173000	4175000	Any word about internet play like Mario Kart?
4175000	4177000	There was no word on that
4177000	4179000	But as I remember mentioning before
4179000	4181000	Two to six players online
4181000	4183000	Interesting
4183000	4185000	And one to two players split screen
4185000	4187000	Local
4187000	4189000	Very very interested in checking this out
4189000	4191000	And the wife is extremely excited
4191000	4193000	It looks interesting
4193000	4195000	But here's the thing about it
4195000	4197000	Didn't we hear that this developer
4197000	4199000	Was working on something that was so secret
4199000	4201000	They had to have the secret screens and all this stuff
4201000	4203000	And I don't know if maybe somebody was just embellishing it or whatever
4203000	4205000	But I'm really thinking in the back of my mind
4205000	4207000	Is this game really that big of a deal
4207000	4209000	That they had to keep it super top secret?
4209000	4211000	It looks good
4211000	4213000	It really does look good compared to Excite Truck
4213000	4215000	And actually the graphics are a lot better
4215000	4217000	I don't know, I'm very interested
4217000	4219000	To check it out
4219000	4221000	They could have a really good game on their hands
4221000	4223000	I think the robotic lizard
4223000	4225000	Frog thing is kind of cool
4225000	4227000	They're going to have a mouse in there that they can play as
4227000	4229000	A robotic mouse, but the turtle looks retarded
4229000	4231000	I'm sorry, he's got this retarded
4231000	4233000	Look on him
4233000	4235000	Like he's been touched in the head or something
4235000	4237000	I don't know, but
4237000	4239000	I don't have to play as a turtle
4239000	4241000	And there's also Ladybug that flies through the air
4241000	4243000	Alright, well some
4243000	4245000	New details about another anticipated Wii game
4245000	4247000	Has hit the internet this week
4247000	4249000	It's about Punch-Out!
4249000	4251000	Punch-Out is coming out in May
4251000	4253000	But apparently some other new details have leaked out
4253000	4255000	About the game, including the fact that some
4255000	4257000	Of the best of the original Punch-Out!
4257000	4259000	Cast will be returning
4259000	4261000	King Hippo obviously was seen in some screenshots
4261000	4263000	Glass Joe is going to be in there
4263000	4265000	Von Kaiser apparently is going to be making a comeback
4265000	4267000	Not exactly one of the fighters
4267000	4269000	I would have thought would be the best of the original
4269000	4271000	Which started Make Me Fearful
4271000	4273000	Because I think somebody said on this show a couple weeks ago
4273000	4275000	Maybe this is just going to be a complete remake of the first game
4275000	4277000	No, they're actually going to have new characters in there
4277000	4279000	It's even says
4279000	4281000	There's going to be some new characters in the game
4281000	4283000	Star Punches are coming back into the game
4283000	4285000	No word on how you get them yet
4285000	4287000	But that could be interesting
4287000	4289000	By the way, Punch-Out! is also going to have two
4289000	4291000	Different control schemes
4291000	4293000	Of course there is the one
4293000	4295000	That will be the whole, you know, waving your arms
4295000	4297000	Around in the air, but apparently
4297000	4299000	Also classic NES
4299000	4301000	Style controls
4301000	4303000	If you flip your Wii remote on the side
4303000	4305000	And play the game, you can play the game that way
4305000	4307000	So that's kind of cool
4307000	4309000	For those of us that don't want to flail our arms around everywhere
4309000	4311000	You can still have some fun with Punch-Out!
4311000	4313000	So there you go
4313000	4315000	Well, obviously Punch-Out!
4315000	4317000	Is a very classic video game
4317000	4319000	But we like to put the spotlight on the classic game
4319000	4321000	Every week here on Orange Laundrio
4321000	4323000	And I can tell you this week it's not Punch-Out!
4323000	4325000	But it is some game that you should definitely be checking out
4325000	4327000	And it's Dark Sakura's classic game of the week
4327000	4329000	She's going to dig through her archives
4329000	4331000	And pull out a game
4331000	4333000	That she wants to share with all of you
4333000	4335000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic video game
4335000	4337000	Of the week this week?
4337000	4339000	The classic game is Plio Plio
4339000	4341000	It is a puzzle game
4341000	4343000	That was created
4343000	4345000	By Compile for the MSX2
4345000	4347000	And
4347000	4349000	It actually uses
4349000	4351000	Characters from
4351000	4353000	Mado Monogatari
4353000	4355000	So it's just a fun little game
4355000	4357000	That's where you drop
4357000	4359000	These bean shaped thingies
4359000	4361000	And have to match them up
4361000	4363000	But you can do drops
4363000	4365000	And make chain combos
4365000	4367000	And I think it's been
4367000	4369000	One of the
4369000	4371000	I'd say
4371000	4373000	Blueprints for many other
4373000	4375000	Puzzle games to come out since
4375000	4377000	Sort of like Puzzle Fighter, remember?
4377000	4379000	Where you had your chains and everything
4379000	4381000	Basically
4381000	4383000	It's
4383000	4385000	We got it in the US as Puyo Pop
4385000	4387000	And we first
4387000	4389000	Saw it though as Dr. Robotnik's
4389000	4391000	Mean Bean Machine
4391000	4393000	Genesis and Good Drive
4393000	4395000	Came out of Game Gear and Master System
4395000	4397000	Which that version actually came out in Europe
4397000	4399000	And Brazil
4399000	4401000	And then we got it as
4401000	4403000	Kirby's Ghost Trap
4403000	4405000	Which was the
4405000	4407000	European SNES version
4407000	4409000	And Kirby's Avalanche
4409000	4411000	Which was our version of it
4411000	4413000	So
4413000	4415000	Basically
4415000	4417000	The whole point of it
4417000	4419000	Is that you have to stack up
4419000	4421000	The Puyo
4421000	4423000	And you have to
4423000	4425000	Match them up and
4425000	4427000	Get them in certain combos so that
4427000	4429000	You can throw that many
4429000	4431000	Number of lines
4431000	4433000	Over on your enemy
4433000	4435000	Who is also playing simultaneous
4435000	4437000	Either the enemy or the computer
4437000	4439000	And they can block your moves by getting
4439000	4441000	Combos of their own, but basically
4441000	4443000	Whoever has a higher combo
4443000	4445000	Then they get to
4445000	4447000	Sit over there, it's actually called
4447000	4449000	Rensa
4449000	4451000	The chain
4451000	4453000	Of how they pop and fall
4453000	4455000	Is called Rensa
4455000	4457000	So you can have any different kind of
4457000	4459000	Variety of it for how they fall
4459000	4463000	And the blocks that fall on the other side
4463000	4465000	Are called
4465000	4467000	Ojama
4467000	4469000	Which are garbage blocks
4469000	4471000	Or as we get them
4471000	4473000	They're new sets of Puyo
4473000	4475000	So
4475000	4477000	Basically, like I said, the higher that you get
4477000	4479000	The more that you drop on your opponent
4479000	4481000	That they do not block
4485000	4487000	I'm sorry, this battle I'm watching on YouTube
4487000	4489000	Is quite epic
4489000	4491000	My god, these players are amazing
4491000	4493000	They're setting up chains left and right
4493000	4495000	I have seen the 19
4495000	4497000	Chain
4497000	4499000	Rob that someone managed to get
4499000	4501000	That's pretty freaking epic
4501000	4503000	And actually this version of the music is from Puyo Puyo 2
4503000	4505000	That I thought was cool
4505000	4507000	But basically
4507000	4509000	You've got single Puyo
4509000	4511000	Where basically you just fight the computer
4511000	4513000	And then you have the versus mode
4513000	4515000	Which is double Puyo Puyo
4515000	4517000	You've got characters in the game
4517000	4519000	Which we've seen a few of them in other games
4519000	4521000	Because actually, Carp Uncle made his way
4521000	4523000	Made a brief appearance in Dr. Robotnik's
4523000	4525000	B&B machine
4525000	4527000	And it was called Has-Been
4527000	4529000	In that game
4529000	4531000	But you have
4531000	4533000	Maja who is the main character
4533000	4535000	Blue girl with brown hair wearing a blue dress
4535000	4537000	And um
4537000	4539000	You also
4539000	4541000	You know, also some of her chains
4541000	4543000	She calls out different spells
4543000	4545000	Because her character is apparently a sorceress
4545000	4547000	And then you've got Carp Uncle
4547000	4549000	Carp Uncle is cute
4549000	4551000	And then
4551000	4553000	For the first Puyo Puyo
4553000	4555000	You get Skeleton Tea, Nasu Grave, Mummy
4555000	4557000	Drako Centauros
4557000	4559000	Sukeidodora
4559000	4561000	Um
4561000	4563000	Skia Podes
4563000	4565000	Harpy
4565000	4567000	You actually have Zombie too
4567000	4569000	Which I think is cool
4569000	4571000	And my favorite name here is Zodamaio
4571000	4573000	And your boss is Satan
4575000	4577000	And you have to fight him
4577000	4579000	Because he likes Arl
4579000	4581000	But he really likes Carp Uncle
4581000	4583000	As far as other versions
4583000	4585000	That have come out
4585000	4587000	Like I said, we've had the US ones
4587000	4589000	That was Dr. Robotnik's
4589000	4591000	BB Machine, Koopa's Avalanche
4591000	4593000	Um
4593000	4595000	They're uh
4595000	4597000	They actually say that the
4597000	4599000	Puyo were
4599000	4601000	Supposed to be like how the
4601000	4603000	Slimes were in Dragon Quest
4603000	4605000	They're actually from that
4605000	4607000	RPG game Madou Monogatari
4607000	4609000	Which if anyone's played it, I'd love to know
4609000	4611000	Um, I haven't
4611000	4613000	But anyway, as other games came out
4613000	4615000	There was the
4615000	4617000	Puyo Puyo Pocket
4617000	4619000	And you had your Pocket Color one
4619000	4621000	So we've had Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2
4621000	4623000	We've had Puyo Pop over here
4623000	4625000	In Japan it was Vina De Puyo Puyo
4625000	4627000	Which means Everybody Puyo Puyo
4627000	4629000	Um
4629000	4631000	We've had Puyo Puyo Sun
4631000	4633000	Which there was actually a Nintendo 64 version
4633000	4635000	Puyo Puyo Sun 64
4635000	4637000	And a Saturn version
4637000	4639000	And Puyo Piyon
4639000	4641000	Which was um, pretty much the second one
4641000	4643000	We also had Puyo Puyo Fever
4643000	4645000	Which we got as Puyo Puyo Pop Fever
4645000	4647000	Um, that was on
4647000	4649000	Uh, actually that was
4649000	4651000	The last game that was released for the Dreamcast
4651000	4653000	So we've had
4653000	4655000	Versions on Xbox, Playstation 2
4655000	4657000	GBA, GameCube
4657000	4659000	DS, PSP
4659000	4661000	Even Mac versions, Widow versions
4661000	4663000	Pocket PC, Palm versions
4663000	4665000	DS, you know, all other
4665000	4667000	Kinds of versions, so
4667000	4669000	It's been pretty cool
4669000	4671000	I actually have the TurboGrafx version
4671000	4673000	At home
4673000	4675000	Which my friend gave me
4675000	4677000	They made this game on every damn system basically
4677000	4679000	Yeah, and you know there was actually
4679000	4681000	A music game sequel
4681000	4683000	Yeah, I remember, I think you showed it to me once
4683000	4685000	Yeah, you showed it to me once
4685000	4687000	Puyo Da
4687000	4689000	I thought it was just you
4689000	4691000	It's a fun little game
4691000	4693000	With Puyo Da, it's like
4693000	4695000	You have to hit the buttons at the right time
4695000	4697000	Sort of like, you know, Parappa-ish thing
4697000	4699000	But depending on how many you get right
4699000	4701000	You know, you get more points
4701000	4703000	And they get bombed
4703000	4705000	So it's an interesting little spinoff
4705000	4707000	Alright
4707000	4709000	Well that's going to do it, is that it?
4709000	4711000	I just had the line in there though
4711000	4713000	That I know that
4713000	4715000	It's not what she's saying
4715000	4717000	It's like the game psychic storm
4717000	4719000	And you translate the line the same way as I get pissed off
4719000	4721000	My husband's crazy
4721000	4723000	So it's the same
4723000	4725000	Alright
4725000	4727000	I believe that is going to do it
4727000	4729000	I hope he's listening because I picked this for him
4729000	4731000	Puyo Puyo
4731000	4733000	And apart from me because I love Puyo Puyo
4733000	4735000	Puyo Puyo is like my favorite puzzle game ever
4735000	4737000	You do bring it up on the show quite often
4737000	4739000	So I'm glad it's finally had a chance to be the game of the week
4739000	4741000	I'll link this other one
4741000	4743000	Because there's actually a Puyo Puyo anime
4743000	4745000	That was supposed to have been out too
4745000	4747000	And a lot of people do
4747000	4749000	Really freaky cosplay from it
4749000	4751000	And also I would say
4751000	4753000	If you want to get a recent version
4753000	4755000	Of Puyo Puyo
4755000	4757000	I got the Sonic Genesis collection
4757000	4759000	Because it has Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine
4759000	4761000	Which granted isn't a pure
4761000	4763000	Quote unquote version of Puyo Puyo
4763000	4765000	But you get at least the gist of the game itself
4765000	4767000	And you know it's part of that big collection
4767000	4769000	So there you go
4769000	4771000	There it is your classic game of the week Puyo Puyo
4771000	4773000	We're going to take a quick break here on Orange Launch Radio
4773000	4775000	But we will be back with plenty more in part B
4775000	4777000	We're going to talk about other companies getting into used game businesses
4777000	4779000	That should be interesting
4779000	4781000	Another game rental methods
4781000	4783000	And some classic fighting games
4783000	4785000	For fighters in the wake of Street Fighter IV
4785000	4787000	We're going to be talking about some of that
4787000	4789000	Coming up next here on Orange Launch Radio
4789000	4791000	Stay tuned
4791000	4797000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio
4797000	4799000	On this Sunday evening
4799000	4801000	March the 8th of 2009
4801000	4803000	Where we are taping live on AllGames.com
4803000	4807000	www.AllGames.com is the radio network that we are a part of
4807000	4809000	Or if you want to check out our show specifically
4809000	4811000	You can check out www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
4811000	4813000	You really should though check out both
4813000	4815000	You know you get a lot of time to surf the internet
4815000	4817000	I'm sure so you should check both sites out
4817000	4819000	Because they're both great
4819000	4821000	Alright we've been talking a lot about the latest and greatest in gaming
4821000	4823000	We're not done yet we've got plenty more
4823000	4825000	Let's talk a little more business now Loki
4825000	4827000	Yes let's talk business
4827000	4833000	Toys R Us is actually going to try to get into the used game business
4833000	4837000	They're going to start doing trade-ins I guess
4837000	4841000	Apparently an in-store advertisement
4841000	4847000	Which was snapped by one of the cheap ass gamer forum members
4847000	4853000	Actually showed that they're starting to do used game sales
4853000	4857000	In some select stores I guess like a trial period
4857000	4867000	Apparently you'll be able to return your games for I guess Jeffrey bucks
4867000	4871000	I'm sure it will be kind of similar to the gift certificate right?
4871000	4875000	Yes Jeffrey the giraffe dollars
4875000	4879000	Which have no currency whatsoever in the real world
4879000	4883000	But yes you will be able to sell your used games back
4883000	4887000	And receive store credit and no word on any pricing tiers
4887000	4891000	Or whether they're going to be competitive or not
4891000	4895000	But hey you know another option for trading in your used games is always welcome
4895000	4901000	Although to be honest man the last time I went into the Toys R Us it was sad
4901000	4907000	Like half the store was converted into a baby's R Us and that was really sad
4907000	4909000	Well I don't know if that's what sells you know
4909000	4911000	I remember those Toys R Us was the shit when I was a kid
4911000	4913000	It was amazing
4913000	4915000	It was so amazing
4915000	4919000	But you know now they have baby's R Us in there
4919000	4921000	Well you know if it sells it sells right?
4921000	4925000	I just remember back in the day they used to have like the Atari 2600 thing set up
4925000	4927000	You could play the old school games on there
4927000	4931000	But it's cutting into my Lego aisle you know
4931000	4935000	Well maybe that's because they have a Lego store at the mall you know
4935000	4937000	Well fuck the- wait what mall?
4937000	4939000	Arden mall they have like a full Lego store now
4939000	4941000	Are you shitting me?
4941000	4943000	I am not shitting you
4943000	4945000	That's so awesome
4945000	4947000	It's apparently like a chain of stores now
4947000	4949000	Good! We need a Lego store
4949000	4951000	They can get rid of the Apple store anytime though
4951000	4953000	But Lego store is awesome
4953000	4955000	I did not know you had such a fan boner for Legos
4955000	4957000	I have 10 gallons of Legos
4957000	4959000	I measure my Legos in volume now
4959000	4961000	Oh my god
4961000	4965000	Between her video game vault and your Legos like I feel like I need something
4965000	4969000	You know what I do have? I have a full dresser drawer
4969000	4971000	Full dresser drawer full of PEZ dispensers
4971000	4973000	I do have that
4973000	4975000	I guess that's my thing I don't know
4975000	4977000	One of these days I'll take them all out and put them on display again
4977000	4979000	But it was getting to be a hassle
4979000	4981000	They'd always fall over
4981000	4983000	People would come over and knock them over to be funny
4983000	4985000	Or they'd get punched over when somebody was drunk
4985000	4987000	That's messed up
4987000	4993000	Do you have one of those PEZ dispensers that dispenses like the whole like rolls of PEZ?
4993000	4995000	No I've seen those for sale though
4995000	4997000	I kind of quit PEZ collecting for a little while
4997000	4999000	Something I did like in high school and for a little while after that
4999000	5001000	But you know what the nice thing is since I stopped for so long
5001000	5005000	Now I have a lot of old PEZ dispensers that have just been sitting in a desk drawer
5005000	5007000	Not getting any sunlight or anything
5007000	5009000	They're in good condition I'm sure
5009000	5013000	But it's not that I'm in the buying and selling business of PEZ dispensers
5013000	5019000	You don't want to be one of those dudes on the food network during unwrapped or something
5019000	5023000	Like I watched one last night and they were talking about some guy that collected Mr. Peanut stuff
5023000	5025000	And he doesn't even like peanuts
5025000	5029000	He's just a douchebag that collects Mr. Peanut crap
5029000	5031000	It's like really? Okay
5031000	5034000	Of course some might argue that I collect Hello Kitty stuff
5034000	5036000	Because even like I'm making coffee right now
5036000	5038000	Like for those listening live that heard me during the break in the middle there
5038000	5041000	I'm brewing some coffee right now on my Hello Kitty coffee maker
5041000	5043000	With your Hello Kitty toaster that makes the Hello Kitty
5043000	5045000	Hey it works, don't hate
5045000	5047000	It brews a damn fine cup of coffee
5047000	5049000	And it was cheap, 20 bucks
5049000	5051000	So, whatever
5051000	5053000	Anyway, I don't know how we got from video games to Hello Kitty
5053000	5056000	But we can go back to talking about used games a little bit
5056000	5059000	You know what's interesting is that Toys R Us is kind of in cahoots with Amazon
5059000	5061000	So to kind of hear this
5061000	5063000	You know, because if you go to Amazon.com
5063000	5065000	Their toy section is all Toys R Us
5065000	5068000	Well Amazon.com is also running a trade-in program
5068000	5070000	Which would make sense if Toys R Us is doing this
5070000	5072000	Because they kind of have a little working agreement or whatever's going on
5072000	5075000	What you do, you can actually trade in games
5075000	5077000	You select games on their website apparently
5077000	5079000	They have to be in good condition
5079000	5081000	You send in a shipment or whatever
5081000	5083000	You print a shipping label on your computer
5083000	5085000	And you can actually send these games in
5085000	5088000	And they will actually send you an Amazon.com gift card
5088000	5090000	For however much the games were worth
5090000	5092000	Which is kind of interesting
5092000	5095000	Now this is something apparently I think is just being tested right now
5095000	5097000	I don't think it's actually starting just yet
5097000	5099000	But, yeah
5099000	5101000	I don't know
5101000	5103000	No, I guess it is up and live now
5103000	5105000	There you go, you can actually check it out on Amazon.com
5105000	5107000	I'm looking at the link right now
5107000	5109000	And yeah, you can actually look up on their site
5109000	5111000	Things you want to trade in
5111000	5113000	And sell back to Amazon.com and you'll get a gift card
5113000	5117000	Which, you know, considering that Amazon.com is much more than video games
5117000	5121000	I think this is where it could prove to be an interesting competitor to GameStop
5121000	5127000	Granted, GameStop, you can get cash for your games
5127000	5129000	You don't get a lot of cash
5129000	5131000	You get more if you go for the gift card
5131000	5133000	On Amazon.com, you can get
5133000	5135000	Books, DVDs
5135000	5139000	Heck, you can get appliances and stuff on the site
5139000	5141000	You can get airsoft guns
5141000	5143000	You can get a lot of stuff on Amazon.com
5143000	5145000	So it does open up this whole new door for that
5145000	5147000	You don't have to just trade in games for games
5147000	5149000	Oh yeah, and they also sell books
5149000	5151000	AgDeftInChat, chat.orangelandraday.com says
5151000	5153000	Rob sounds excited
5153000	5155000	I don't know, I don't ever sell games back
5155000	5157000	I probably should
5157000	5159000	I have a lot
5159000	5161000	I'm going to miss Drive Unlimited
5161000	5163000	I realize I had it sitting on my shelf collecting dust
5163000	5165000	I had no idea you even had it
5165000	5167000	Well, that's great, I'll plug that in and try it this week or something
5167000	5169000	But yeah, I don't know
5169000	5171000	DarkTotemic in chat says
5171000	5173000	Sky, really, the only thing GameStop has over these is
5173000	5175000	When you trade in a game, you can get a new one right away
5175000	5177000	Amazon, you'll have to wait for shipping
5177000	5179000	And that is a good counterpoint
5179000	5181000	Because yeah, I don't like to wait for shipping and all this stuff
5181000	5183000	I don't even like Netflix, because it's too slow
5183000	5185000	When I want to watch a movie, I want to watch it now
5185000	5189000	That's why I like Netflix Instant Queues, but let's face it, not everything is available on the Instant Queue
5189000	5191000	So, I don't know
5191000	5193000	DJ Rama S in chat says
5193000	5195000	Now at GameStop, you get the same amount if it's cash or credit
5195000	5197000	That must be a new thing
5197000	5199000	I don't know about that
5199000	5201000	It could be a promotion or something they're running right now
5201000	5203000	But it didn't used to be that way
5203000	5205000	Yeah, it seems kind of fishy
5205000	5207000	Because I'd be getting cash every time
5207000	5209000	Why now, do you think that they're getting into this?
5209000	5211000	Do you think it's just the state of the economy?
5211000	5213000	There's more of a demand for used games
5213000	5215000	Because $60 is a really high price point to get games
5215000	5217000	I don't know
5217000	5219000	Probably it's a big margin item
5219000	5221000	It's a business that has a good margin on it
5221000	5223000	Why not try to get into it?
5223000	5225000	Amazon is a powerful name
5225000	5227000	Online merchants
5227000	5233000	If they can put together a really valuable system that people want to check out
5233000	5237000	Because I remember reading the trade-in values for some of these games
5237000	5239000	And they were a few bucks higher than GameStop
5239000	5241000	But you've got to wait
5241000	5243000	A little bit longer
5243000	5245000	If you want to go that route
5245000	5247000	I guess you could
5247000	5249000	If you're kind of patient
5249000	5251000	I may look up some of my games to see if they're worth anything
5251000	5253000	If you're really patient
5253000	5255000	Just put them on eBay
5255000	5257000	Seriously
5257000	5259000	Did you know Beautiful Katamari is a rare game now?
5259000	5261000	On Xbox 360
5261000	5263000	I guess they don't print it anymore
5263000	5265000	When you find it online
5265000	5267000	It's actually kind of pricey
5267000	5269000	Kind of interesting
5269000	5271000	Damn
5271000	5273000	That's what I heard earlier today
5273000	5275000	DarkSoccer, I would ask for your opinion on this whole thing
5275000	5277000	But then I kind of realized you have a museum in your house
5277000	5279000	You probably never sell back video games
5279000	5281000	Do you?
5281000	5283000	Sometimes we do, but we just sell back the newer crap
5283000	5285000	Like sports games and shit
5285000	5287000	I see
5287000	5289000	Is this something that interests you at all?
5289000	5291000	Let's assume, hypothetically, your husband didn't manage
5291000	5293000	Direct competition of this whole thing
5293000	5295000	Do you think this Amazon.com thing is something that would be interesting?
5295000	5297000	I don't think so
5297000	5299000	We don't trade books at a video game store
5299000	5301000	We just take them back to his store
5301000	5303000	And trade them in for games at his store
5303000	5305000	Right, but let's say hypothetically
5305000	5307000	He didn't have that
5307000	5309000	Because not everybody has a husband that does that
5309000	5311000	I just thought I'd ask
5311000	5313000	Any more you want to add to this DarkSagra?
5313000	5315000	Good idea in theory
5315000	5317000	I think Chegg.com started the trend actually
5317000	5319000	For doing it online
5319000	5321000	For having schoolbooks that you could rent
5321000	5323000	And then trade in your old schoolbooks online
5323000	5325000	To them and then get credit
5325000	5327000	For stuff for your next
5327000	5329000	Semester schoolbooks
5329000	5331000	It is interesting how the internet will do this sometimes
5331000	5333000	Is that, you know, they might take an idea
5333000	5335000	Like, for instance, Gamefly was essentially
5335000	5337000	Kind of a rip-off of Netflix in a way
5337000	5339000	But it was, you know, for video games
5339000	5341000	So it's kind of interesting how you might take an idea
5341000	5343000	For one industry and kind of make it your own industry
5343000	5345000	And then, you know
5345000	5347000	That's your new business
5347000	5349000	But I don't know, anyway
5349000	5351000	Let's go on to the next story
5351000	5353000	Well, in other news
5353000	5355000	Speaking of GameStop
5355000	5357000	They've actually dropped
5357000	5359000	13%
5359000	5361000	In their stock value
5361000	5363000	Ever since Amazon announced
5363000	5365000	Their little trade-in deal
5367000	5369000	They actually
5369000	5371000	Ended
5371000	5373000	The day
5373000	5375000	On Thursday trading in at $3.54
5375000	5377000	Lower than it had before
5377000	5379000	So it looks like
5379000	5381000	That their investors are actually
5381000	5383000	Getting kind of worried about
5383000	5385000	Amazon's little plan
5385000	5387000	Even though GameStop themselves aren't
5387000	5389000	And looking at this
5389000	5391000	It's a fairly significant
5391000	5393000	Drop from what it was
5393000	5395000	Interesting
5395000	5397000	Another company
5397000	5399000	Is actually trying something a little bit different
5399000	5401000	As far as games go
5401000	5403000	Is actually Gamefly
5403000	5405000	Now Gamefly is testing out this brand new kiosk
5405000	5407000	Called the GBox
5407000	5409000	It's a game rental kiosk
5409000	5411000	It's gonna be
5411000	5413000	It's been spotted at Texas Tech University
5413000	5415000	They're probably gonna be launching
5415000	5417000	This
5417000	5419000	Probably on a limited basis right now
5419000	5421000	To check it out
5421000	5423000	It will allow you to rent
5423000	5425000	Games
5425000	5427000	For $2.49 a day
5427000	5429000	For, you know, Xbox 360
5429000	5431000	And PS3
5431000	5433000	And $1.99 a day for Wii
5433000	5435000	And it's gonna have new titles
5435000	5437000	And they're gonna carry them for, I guess, a short period of time
5437000	5439000	And apparently
5439000	5441000	Now no word yet
5441000	5443000	If this is gonna tie into
5443000	5445000	Your Gamefly subscription
5445000	5447000	Because that would be pretty cool
5447000	5449000	If you could actually have your
5449000	5451000	Gamefly subscription
5451000	5453000	And be able to say
5453000	5455000	Take these back to a kiosk
5455000	5457000	Instead of mailing them back in
5457000	5459000	That might be pretty cool
5459000	5461000	But I know definitely kiosk rentals
5461000	5463000	And stuff like that are pretty popular
5463000	5465000	They've, you know, hell with Redbox
5465000	5467000	And stuff and almost all the McDonalds
5467000	5469000	And all the grocery stores out there
5469000	5471000	It's not surprising that they're
5471000	5473000	Gonna do something like this
5473000	5475000	And actually I'm kind of interested in that
5475000	5477000	Hopefully they do put that out
5477000	5479000	Because $2.49 a night is not too bad actually
5479000	5481000	But if you compare it to
5481000	5483000	Say $8 for 5 days
5483000	5485000	I guess
5485000	5487000	It could become expensive
5487000	5489000	But if you just want a taste of a game
5489000	5491000	For like a day or something
5491000	5493000	Might not be a bad idea
5493000	5495000	I'm kind of dumb, the ones I see at Walmart
5495000	5497000	And stuff with the, you know, DVDs
5497000	5499000	But I have Netflix, I have Instant Netflix
5499000	5501000	You know, I have other ways to access movies
5501000	5503000	But then I think about this whole concept for games
5503000	5505000	And I'm kind of like, well, you know, if
5505000	5507000	Walmart right by my house had a box like this
5507000	5509000	I might be tempted to rent games
5509000	5511000	Rather than just
5511000	5513000	You know, purchasing them
5513000	5515000	For like $60
5515000	5517000	But you can kind of already do that at Blockbuster
5517000	5519000	And stuff, so I wonder what it is about these kiosks
5519000	5521000	That makes it so appealing
5521000	5523000	I don't know why I rent a new movie from a kiosk
5523000	5525000	Because you can get it at the same thing at Blockbuster
5525000	5527000	For the same price
5527000	5529000	Or, you know, for a longer period of time
5529000	5531000	Obviously, but you know, if you want to do it by night
5531000	5533000	It's all about convenience
5533000	5535000	Because once, you know, if something like this takes off
5535000	5537000	Then you're going to see a lot more of these people
5537000	5539000	Doing it, and I bet you anything
5539000	5541000	If Gamefly has good success with this
5541000	5543000	You'll probably see Redbox doing it
5543000	5545000	They'll probably just have some sort of hybrid kiosk
5545000	5547000	Where you can rent games and movies
5547000	5549000	And trust me, companies like that
5549000	5551000	Have thought about doing it
5551000	5553000	And they've tested it in some markets
5553000	5555000	But the problem is, though, is
5555000	5557000	They're retarded, and they think that they can
5557000	5559000	Make their money back on a game
5559000	5561000	Charging 99 cents a night
5561000	5563000	Well, that ain't the case, because games cost $60
5563000	5565000	Where movies cost $20
5565000	5567000	So it's obviously not going to make sense for them
5567000	5569000	You try to tell to them, they don't understand
5569000	5571000	Some comments from Chatroom, AcidicVampire
5571000	5573000	Kind of said the same thing you did
5573000	5575000	Redbox, the video game edition
5575000	5577000	So, perhaps just a matter of time
5577000	5579000	Blockbuster is still around, LOL
5579000	5581000	That's true, you know, these big box stores
5581000	5583000	Are having a hard time kind of staying in business
5583000	5585000	Because of just the competition they're getting from Netflix
5585000	5587000	And so on and so on
5587000	5589000	You know, I don't know, I think Blockbuster has a really interesting
5589000	5591000	Setup with the fact that they have
5591000	5593000	Their Netflix slash, what do they call it?
5593000	5595000	Blockbuster Total Access or something
5595000	5597000	It's like basically Netflix, okay
5597000	5599000	But it's Blockbuster stuff
5599000	5601000	And you can trade in the store
5601000	5603000	So that way they get around the whole shipping thing
5603000	5605000	If you don't want to wait for shipping, you can trade in the store
5605000	5607000	It's cool, but the thing that Netflix has on them
5607000	5609000	Is that Netflix has the streaming
5609000	5611000	And Blockbuster doesn't
5611000	5613000	Like if Blockbuster teamed up with PS3 or something
5613000	5615000	I would leave Netflix
5615000	5617000	And go to Blockbuster
5617000	5619000	You know, that was one of the rumors floating around
5619000	5621000	My own
5621000	5623000	That would be pretty big
5623000	5625000	You know, Blockbusters and stuff like that
5625000	5627000	The kiosks are good if you know what you're looking for
5627000	5629000	But a lot of the times
5629000	5631000	If you don't know what you're looking for
5631000	5633000	The kiosks are not really good
5633000	5635000	Because then you can't just browse stuff
5635000	5637000	I mean, they do have stuff
5637000	5639000	You can look at
5639000	5641000	But there's going to be a lot of people
5641000	5643000	Waiting for the stupid kiosk
5643000	5645000	And you kind of feel pressured
5645000	5647000	Let me ask a question to chat and everybody here
5647000	5649000	Kind of a little bit of a deeper question about this
5649000	5651000	And everybody in the studio and those in chat too
5651000	5653000	Is this type of announcement
5653000	5655000	Really a good thing for the gaming industry
5655000	5657000	Because if we're sitting here
5657000	5659000	Loki and I talking about
5659000	5661000	Maybe we'll stop making these $60 impulse buys
5661000	5663000	If we could just rent the game for $2.50
5663000	5665000	Out of one of these kiosks
5665000	5667000	In the long run, is this going to be a good thing
5667000	5669000	For the gaming industry
5669000	5671000	Or is this setting up the gaming industry to get shot in the foot
5671000	5673000	No, I think it is a good thing
5673000	5675000	And the reason why is because if this kiosk
5675000	5677000	Is going to be set up similar to say
5677000	5679000	A red box kiosk
5679000	5681000	Not only can you rent stuff from them
5681000	5683000	You can buy stuff from them
5683000	5685000	And so, just because they put stuff in there
5685000	5687000	People might like it
5687000	5689000	And they can purchase it from the kiosk
5689000	5691000	However though
5691000	5693000	On kind of the DVD movie side
5693000	5697000	Not everyone is on board with the whole kiosk things
5697000	5699000	In fact, there's a deal going on right now
5699000	5701000	With Universal
5701000	5703000	Where all their product is basically banned
5703000	5705000	From red box kiosks
5705000	5707000	They will not sell to red box
5707000	5709000	And they will find anybody that sells to them
5709000	5711000	And basically ruin any sort of deals
5711000	5713000	That have gone on
5713000	5715000	So, red box
5715000	5717000	The people that run those
5717000	5719000	Have to go out and actually purchase movies
5719000	5721000	From say a big box retailer
5721000	5723000	And then put them in their kiosk
5723000	5725000	But they can't purchase them directly
5725000	5727000	So they think that it's affecting their
5727000	5729000	Sell through business
5729000	5731000	By having these red box kiosks
5731000	5733000	Really when you look at the facts
5733000	5735000	That's not really the case
5735000	5737000	It's not really having a large impact on it
5737000	5739000	But that's the fear
5739000	5741000	But the thing is
5741000	5743000	With $60 games nowadays
5743000	5745000	I think a lot more people are renting things
5745000	5747000	But there's still those other rental avenues
5747000	5749000	You know, you don't necessarily
5749000	5751000	Need to use this kiosk
5751000	5753000	And right now this kiosk thing is very limited
5753000	5755000	Question from Robert M. in Chat
5755000	5757000	And I don't know if you know this because it involves Apple
5757000	5759000	But didn't Universal pull their videos from iTunes at one point?
5759000	5761000	I think they did because I soon remember like Heroes
5761000	5763000	And the NBC shows
5763000	5765000	But I think that was more of an NBC thing
5765000	5767000	And NBC and Universal are in cahoots
5767000	5769000	So I think, I don't know if it's necessarily related to the red box thing
5769000	5771000	I think it was always a money thing
5771000	5773000	Right?
5773000	5775000	Other great comments from chat, thank you chatters
5775000	5777000	Breslull, no
5777000	5779000	This was the same thing as Blockbuster renting games
5779000	5781000	And Nintendo got all pissy back in the late 80s, early 90s
5781000	5783000	Acidic Vampire
5783000	5785000	It's a great thing because people will still buy the game
5785000	5787000	If they like it, especially gamers
5787000	5789000	DJ Rama S
5789000	5791000	This could force the gaming industry to lower the price of the PlayStation 3
5791000	5793000	360 games
5793000	5795000	ActDeft, sounds interesting but I really don't know if it'll work or not
5795000	5797000	XLink
5797000	5799000	It can be a pro because you can try to see if you want to buy the game
5799000	5801000	Yeah, I mean I get that
5801000	5803000	I see the pro for us
5803000	5805000	I don't know if I see the pro for the developers
5805000	5807000	You know what I'm surprised hasn't happened yet
5807000	5809000	GameStop doing rentals
5809000	5811000	I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet
5811000	5813000	Who knows
5813000	5815000	Son of Dad
5815000	5817000	It might bring down game prices for retail as a whole
5817000	5819000	I would buy a used game from a red box for 25 bucks
5819000	5821000	If it was available
5821000	5823000	Superdude in chat says
5823000	5825000	Wouldn't it be great if you could just stream new releases games
5825000	5827000	Like you do with Netflix on Xbox Live
5827000	5829000	I bet you something like that is coming
5829000	5831000	There's those rumors going around that the PSP 2
5831000	5833000	Or whatever they're going to call it
5833000	5835000	New PSP is going to not have a UMD slot
5835000	5837000	I think we had a story on that a couple weeks ago
5837000	5839000	Imagine if you could only download games
5839000	5841000	I don't use my UMD slot
5841000	5843000	Well
5843000	5845000	It's a little different for you
5845000	5847000	But you know what I'm saying
5847000	5849000	You kind of are seeing this shift towards digital distribution
5849000	5851000	I think there was a lot of
5851000	5853000	I seem to remember
5853000	5855000	We've been doing this show long enough now
5855000	5857000	I seem to remember in the last generation
5857000	5859000	When it was new and all this stuff was new
5859000	5861000	When we first started our show
5861000	5863000	There was talk that this round of systems
5863000	5865000	We're in now
5865000	5867000	Was going to be all digital distribution
5867000	5869000	And certainly with things like Xbox Live Arcade
5869000	5871000	PlayStation Network
5871000	5873000	There's a gigantic foot in the door
5873000	5875000	But we haven't seen a complete shift to that yet
5875000	5877000	But the games on Xbox Live are getting bigger and bigger
5877000	5879000	You know they got rid of those limits on Xbox Live
5879000	5881000	That Watchmen game is what
5881000	5883000	Like a gig or something
5883000	5885000	I mean that's the size of a DVD
5885000	5887000	I don't know
5887000	5889000	You know
5889000	5891000	I would think maybe something like that is coming
5891000	5893000	Where you could stream games like that
5893000	5895000	But I don't think it's going to be
5895000	5897000	The retail games
5897000	5899000	It's going to be a long time before you see the retail games
5899000	5901000	Buy into that
5901000	5903000	But certainly
5903000	5905000	Digital distribution has games all its own
5905000	5907000	Sony's on board with it
5907000	5909000	They're doing their first party games
5909000	5911000	Available for PSP as digital downloads
5911000	5913000	At the same time as release
5913000	5915000	And they've kind of
5915000	5917000	Tested the waters a little bit with Gran Turismo 5
5917000	5919000	Prologue, Warhawk
5919000	5921000	You know, Burnout Paradise
5921000	5923000	So
5923000	5925000	If they can find a way that
5925000	5927000	People would be interested
5927000	5929000	In purchasing these games
5929000	5931000	Heck a lot of Xbox Live Arcade games
5931000	5933000	I could see that you know
5933000	5935000	They could have released them as a disc version
5935000	5937000	But they decided not to
5937000	5939000	And they just released it as an Xbox Live Arcade title
5939000	5941000	And it's still done very well
5941000	5943000	I'm not surprised
5943000	5945000	Alright, we're going to move on to another story
5945000	5947000	But if you want to give your comments on this
5947000	5949000	Mailbag at orangelauncherator.com
5949000	5951000	Send us an email especially
5951000	5953000	I really want to hear from
5953000	5955000	And I know we have a few that listen to this show
5955000	5957000	I want to hear from the people that work for the developers and publishers
5957000	5959000	What do you think about these boxes?
5959000	5961000	What do you see as the impact to your business?
5961000	5963000	I want to kind of hear from those guys
5963000	5965000	If you need to stay anonymous for whatever reason
5965000	5967000	Then put it in your email
5967000	5969000	We'll be happy to stay anonymous
5969000	5971000	I want to hear from that side of things
5971000	5973000	Because I don't think we have anybody
5973000	5975000	In the chat tonight
5975000	5977000	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about
5977000	5979000	Maybe games that you might rant through these kiosks someday
5979000	5981000	Arc System Works
5981000	5983000	They are the folks that put together Guilty Gear
5983000	5985000	They are doing a new high def 2D fighter
5985000	5987000	The game is called Blaze Blue
5987000	5989000	I don't know how exactly you pronounce that
5989000	5991000	It's Blaze Blue I would imagine
5991000	5993000	It's coming out on the Xbox 360
5993000	5995000	And the Playstation 3
5995000	5997000	Right now the game is out in Japanese arcades
5997000	5999000	It's coming out to home consoles over in Japan
5999000	6001000	And it's going to be coming out on the Xbox 360
6001000	6003000	And PS3 as well
6003000	6005000	Apparently over the Japanese arcade release
6005000	6007000	In the console versions there will now be a story mode
6007000	6009000	Some individual stories for each character
6009000	6011000	And so on
6011000	6013000	30 hours of gameplay according to the director Toshimichi Mori
6013000	6015000	Also there's going to be
6015000	6017000	Of course online support
6017000	6019000	Which you can expect in this current generation of games
6019000	6021000	And download content as well
6021000	6023000	Although they haven't said is that just going to be outfits
6023000	6025000	New characters, moves, backgrounds
6025000	6027000	Whatever
6027000	6029000	Kind of interesting especially if you're into
6029000	6031000	Those Japanese fighting games
6031000	6033000	I know there's a few sprinkled throughout the country
6033000	6035000	Those Japanese style arcades where you can go play those machines
6035000	6037000	I'm sure for fighting games
6037000	6039000	Fans there's a few of this
6039000	6041000	But it's interesting now that you're starting to hear
6041000	6043000	A little bit about a resurgence of 2D fighters
6043000	6045000	I wonder if Street Fighter 4 is to thank for any of that
6045000	6047000	Although I imagine something like this
6047000	6049000	Had to be in development
6049000	6051000	For a long long time
6051000	6053000	Shadow Charlie in chat says
6053000	6055000	Yeah I played Blaze Blue in Chinatown
6055000	6057000	What'd you think? I'm curious
6057000	6059000	I had not heard of this game before tonight
6059000	6061000	Seeing that news bit
6061000	6063000	They showed it off a while ago
6063000	6065000	It looks pretty sweet
6065000	6067000	It's all hand drawn
6067000	6069000	100,000 animations per character
6069000	6071000	Nice
6071000	6073000	Dan Shadow I agree with his comment in chat
6073000	6075000	When are we going to have a new Marvel vs Capcom
6075000	6077000	That's the one I'd like to see
6077000	6079000	Or Capcom vs SNK
6079000	6081000	Would be the one I'd really like to see
6081000	6083000	A few weeks ago on the show about how Street Fighter 4
6083000	6085000	Feels a little bit like there's a slight SNK influence
6085000	6087000	Like Crimson Viper
6087000	6089000	Totally feels like she's lifted out of an SNK
6089000	6091000	But anyhow
6091000	6093000	Go listen to a previous show
6093000	6095000	If you want to listen to that
6095000	6097000	Other 2D fighter news Dark Sakura
6097000	6099000	Well we have
6099000	6101000	Actually it's funny you mentioned SNK
6101000	6103000	We actually have news
6103000	6105000	On King of Fighters 12
6105000	6107000	How long has it been out?
6107000	6109000	12 years maybe
6109000	6111000	Lucky guess
6111000	6113000	Well it's actually the
6113000	6115000	First HD version
6115000	6117000	That's going to be on
6117000	6119000	From SNK Playmore
6119000	6121000	It's supposed to be on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3
6121000	6123000	It has 20 playable characters
6123000	6125000	And they're all
6125000	6127000	Freshly redrawn
6127000	6129000	And the backgrounds are all new and pretty
6129000	6131000	And
6131000	6133000	Supposed to really kick a bunch of ass
6135000	6137000	There's supposed to be preview footage
6137000	6139000	And images
6139000	6141000	Included with the PS2 release of
6141000	6143000	King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match
6143000	6145000	Let us know if you see them
6145000	6147000	My's in it right?
6147000	6149000	That's all I want to know
6149000	6151000	Well of course we already heard boobs
6151000	6153000	Alright me bouncy
6153000	6155000	That's all I need
6155000	6157000	Anyways
6157000	6159000	So
6159000	6161000	Interesting
6161000	6163000	Of course there's a lot of
6163000	6165000	Piracy and flashcard developers
6165000	6167000	On
6167000	6169000	The DS and one of those would be
6169000	6171000	The Cyclo DS or
6171000	6173000	The CycloWiz which is the flash
6173000	6175000	Not flashcard but the modchip I have on my Wii actually
6175000	6177000	They have developed
6177000	6179000	A new
6179000	6181000	Program or update to their
6181000	6183000	Program that bypasses
6183000	6185000	The anti-piracy
6185000	6187000	Features in a lot of these games
6187000	6189000	And apparently now works on all the current games
6189000	6191000	That feature some sort of anti-piracy
6191000	6193000	Lockout
6193000	6195000	Yeah
6195000	6197000	There's no way to spin that
6197000	6199000	That's only for piracy
6199000	6201000	So I guess
6201000	6203000	If you're interested in pirating games
6203000	6205000	The Cyclo DS is the way to go
6205000	6207000	For now
6207000	6209000	But interesting though
6211000	6213000	Is this something we should really be encouraging?
6213000	6215000	No
6215000	6217000	But it's one of those things that you know
6217000	6219000	One reason I like to report on this on the show
6219000	6221000	Is I know we all do is
6221000	6223000	It's out there
6223000	6225000	So you can't deny its existence
6225000	6227000	So it's kind of interesting to see what
6227000	6229000	That scene does to always compensate for what
6229000	6231000	The developers of the systems do and back and forth
6231000	6233000	Yeah
6233000	6235000	Alright
6235000	6237000	Talking a little bit
6237000	6239000	About Metal Gear Online
6239000	6241000	Kind of moving over a little bit
6241000	6243000	It's a new expansion coming out on St.
6243000	6245000	Patrick's Day March 17th
6245000	6247000	It's Metal Gear Online scene expansion
6247000	6249000	Three brand new maps
6249000	6251000	Coming to the game
6251000	6253000	Two new characters are going to be coming as well
6253000	6255000	Raiden and Vamp apparently are the new characters
6255000	6257000	That you're going to see in the Metal Gear Online
6257000	6259000	Also some new special gear
6259000	6261000	Which I think is kind of funny because now you can
6261000	6263000	Apparently wear a bikini if you want
6263000	6265000	Or you can dress yourself up in clown face or whatever
6265000	6267000	Or you can wear the head of
6267000	6269000	Robbie the Rabbit if you want to be extra creepy
6269000	6271000	That would be from Silent Hill
6271000	6273000	So there you go
6273000	6275000	Or if you just want to encourage people to shoot you I don't know
6275000	6277000	Also there's going to be a brand new game type
6277000	6279000	Of Metal Gear Online
6279000	6281000	It's free if you get the pack or not
6281000	6283000	It's solo capture
6283000	6285000	It's just like team capture
6285000	6287000	But you know you're by yourself
6287000	6289000	Because it's solo capture
6289000	6291000	This expansion will cost you $9.99
6291000	6293000	If you want to get all the costumes and the characters
6293000	6295000	And all that stuff
6295000	6297000	Yep there you go
6297000	6299000	Pre-order start on the 10th
6299000	6301000	And there's some screenshots floating around the internet there
6301000	6303000	Some other items
6303000	6305000	You can get a visor for Raiden
6305000	6307000	Etc, etc
6307000	6309000	I don't know anyone that plays Metal Gear Online
6309000	6311000	But I bet it has a pretty rabid community
6311000	6313000	Because I can't think of many games like it
6313000	6315000	So there you go
6315000	6317000	Alright let's move on with some more gaming news
6317000	6319000	Well I would say this also doubles as pet news
6319000	6321000	Well I would say this also doubles as pet news
6321000	6323000	Um, Etsy
6323000	6325000	Which is a site that has all kinds of sellers
6325000	6327000	That sell cute hand crafts
6327000	6329000	And clothes and stuff like that
6329000	6331000	There is um
6331000	6333000	A series of
6333000	6335000	Cat toys
6335000	6337000	Um, they look like controllers
6337000	6339000	They have one that's a um
6339000	6341000	Guitar Hero controller
6341000	6343000	They have a Wiimote
6343000	6345000	Um, a Gameboy
6345000	6347000	An old school Gameboy
6347000	6349000	Like the brick
6349000	6351000	They have a 360 controller
6351000	6353000	And a uh
6353000	6355000	NES controller
6355000	6357000	And they look like they're made out of felt
6357000	6359000	And they are for the kitties
6359000	6361000	They're so cute
6361000	6363000	I was gonna say and above all
6363000	6365000	They're just cute
6365000	6367000	Adorable for little kitties
6367000	6369000	I have to show this picture to the chat room
6369000	6371000	Uh, might Shermie be getting one of these?
6371000	6373000	No
6373000	6375000	She don't play with any of the shit I buy her
6375000	6377000	You know what she plays with?
6377000	6379000	She plays with twist ties
6379000	6381000	Nice
6381000	6383000	How about your kitty, Loki?
6383000	6385000	I know you got a kitty a couple years ago
6385000	6387000	Is this something that my cat would play with?
6387000	6389000	No, she'd probably look at it and go
6389000	6391000	Does she still play with like that stick?
6391000	6393000	Uh
6393000	6395000	Oh, like the feather and stuff?
6395000	6397000	Yeah, she loves the feather
6397000	6399000	No, her thing right now, what she's been doing
6399000	6401000	Um, she likes it when we make her tents
6401000	6403000	Or like little forts on the couch
6403000	6405000	Like every time we go to bed now
6405000	6407000	We build her a fort
6407000	6409000	Using the blankets on the couch
6409000	6411000	And she loves that
6411000	6413000	She's really easy to
6413000	6415000	Um, entertain
6415000	6417000	She likes the milk rings
6417000	6419000	You know, the little rings on the uh, milk cartons
6419000	6421000	Shermie likes those too
6421000	6423000	Yeah, she has like 90 of them in the house
6423000	6425000	And there's like, she dumps them all in her food
6425000	6427000	And water for some reason, I'm not sure why
6427000	6429000	But
6429000	6431000	I don't know
6431000	6433000	She's making tea, making plastic tea
6433000	6435000	I guess
6435000	6437000	I always say Shermie puts her food in her water bowl
6437000	6439000	Because she wants tea, or gravy
6439000	6441000	I want a kitty, I don't have any cute kitty stories like you guys do
6441000	6443000	I want a kitty
6443000	6445000	The roommate doesn't want a kitty though, so I'll have to wait
6445000	6447000	But, someday
6447000	6449000	Oh well
6449000	6451000	Um, now
6451000	6453000	Not necessarily something for Kat
6453000	6455000	But um, the Playstation Network
6455000	6457000	Um, Sony is I guess
6457000	6459000	Trying to make this more like
6459000	6461000	The Virtual Console
6461000	6463000	Now, the rumor is I guess that
6463000	6465000	They're going to try to
6465000	6467000	Put more
6467000	6469000	Non-PS1 titles on the
6469000	6471000	Playstation Network
6471000	6473000	No word on exactly
6473000	6475000	Um
6475000	6477000	What systems they're talking about
6477000	6479000	It's got to be arcade games
6479000	6481000	It's got to be, just through process of elimination
6481000	6483000	They can't put Nintendo games on there
6483000	6485000	It would be pointless then to put Sega games on there
6485000	6487000	Now that they have that collection out
6487000	6489000	Maybe they could strike a deal for TurboGrafx games
6489000	6491000	Or something, but I'm thinking arcade games
6491000	6493000	You know, we have like Mortal Kombat 2 on Playstation Network
6493000	6495000	Right? So, I'm thinking arcade games
6495000	6497000	Yeah
6497000	6499000	Um, yeah basically
6499000	6501000	They're promising more PS1 titles
6501000	6503000	And also more pre-PS1
6503000	6505000	Retro titles
6505000	6507000	So I'm guessing those will be the arcade games
6507000	6509000	You can't really play
6509000	6511000	Games like Mortal Kombat
6511000	6513000	Over the PSP thing, right?
6513000	6515000	Because I remember Mortal Kombat 2 was one of the first games
6515000	6517000	That came out on Playstation Network, but you can play it on the PS3
6517000	6519000	But you can't play that on the PSP, can you?
6519000	6521000	It doesn't have that whole functionality, does it?
6521000	6523000	You can't play like multiplayer over
6523000	6525000	Wi-Fi or anything like that
6525000	6527000	The emulator that it uses to run those
6527000	6529000	Doesn't work that way
6529000	6531000	Yeah, any Playstation 1 games
6531000	6533000	That are on the PS3
6533000	6535000	Can be played on the PSP
6535000	6537000	I don't know if Mortal Kombat 2 counts, though
6537000	6539000	I'm talking specifically that one
6539000	6541000	That might have been an Xbox
6541000	6543000	Like a Playstation Network game
6543000	6545000	So that might not work
6545000	6547000	But if it's a PS1 classic title
6547000	6549000	Then yes, that can be ported over
6549000	6551000	If I would get a memory card for my PSP
6551000	6553000	I could play sweet code on the go
6553000	6555000	But anyhow
6555000	6557000	Going on to a completely different note here
6557000	6559000	This story has to do
6559000	6561000	With censorship
6561000	6563000	Who doesn't love censorship, right?
6563000	6565000	Although, I don't know if you could
6565000	6567000	Directly say it's like censorship
6567000	6569000	But apparently, over in New Zealand
6569000	6571000	There's a guy
6571000	6573000	That wants to actually
6573000	6575000	I guess
6575000	6577000	Jail adults who allow their kids
6577000	6579000	To play video games that are violent
6579000	6581000	Yeah, this is according to
6581000	6583000	Chief Censor Bill Hastings
6583000	6585000	From New Zealand
6585000	6587000	You might think the offense is silly
6587000	6589000	But it ain't
6589000	6591000	Apparently, if you were to, let's say, let your kid
6591000	6593000	Play a violent video game
6593000	6595000	Shoot him up, blow some hookers in Grand Theft Auto
6595000	6597000	Whatever
6597000	6599000	Apparently, if you were the parent
6599000	6601000	You let your kid play this game
6601000	6603000	You could face up to three months in prison
6603000	6605000	Or a $10,000 fine
6605000	6607000	This law is set up to send a message
6607000	6609000	How about
6609000	6611000	Just let people raise their children?
6611000	6613000	The way they want
6613000	6615000	To read something like that, I'm like
6615000	6617000	A big brother is watching you, how are they gonna catch you?
6617000	6619000	Are they gonna be watching me in my house
6619000	6621000	Or rely on people, tattling on other people?
6621000	6623000	This doesn't make sense at all
6623000	6625000	Dan and I had a conversation about this earlier today, actually
6625000	6627000	Really?
6627000	6629000	That we actually wouldn't mind if our kids play violent games
6629000	6631000	As long as, you know, we balanced it
6631000	6633000	And had, you know, talks to them
6633000	6635000	And everything
6635000	6637000	We're actually going to do it
6637000	6639000	Intelligently
6639000	6641000	There's no way
6641000	6643000	You can just
6643000	6645000	Shield and shelter them all the time
6645000	6647000	Or else they don't grow up to be balanced
6647000	6649000	Individuals
6649000	6651000	You know
6651000	6653000	GS68 in chat says
6653000	6655000	Parents, not government, should be in charge of what their kids play
6655000	6657000	I think a very well-rounded statement
6657000	6659000	Interesting though
6659000	6661000	So you would probably let your kids play
6661000	6663000	Violent video games, I don't know
6663000	6665000	I'd probably play it with them
6665000	6667000	Well no, I would play it with them
6667000	6669000	In the right context
6669000	6671000	I think it would be alright
6671000	6673000	I'm trying to think about myself
6673000	6675000	Maybe someday I'll have a kid somehow or whatever
6675000	6677000	But I don't know if
6677000	6679000	Part of me says
6679000	6681000	If you don't let them play it
6681000	6683000	They're going to find a way to do it
6683000	6685000	And you're right, if you're not the one playing it with them
6685000	6687000	Then they might not get it in the right context
6687000	6689000	If that makes sense
6689000	6691000	Well on top of that, and this goes true for just about anybody
6691000	6693000	Child, adult, whatever
6693000	6695000	The things that people are not allowed to do
6695000	6697000	Tend to be the things
6697000	6699000	That they want to do just because they're not allowed to
6699000	6701000	Do you know what I mean?
6701000	6703000	Like for
6703000	6705000	I'll use this as an example
6705000	6707000	There's a method of eating called the intuitive diet
6707000	6709000	Where you don't
6709000	6711000	Disallow yourself anything to eat
6711000	6713000	Because that increases your craving for it
6713000	6715000	Because you're fixated on finding everything but that
6715000	6717000	But meanwhile the thing that you want is fixated
6717000	6719000	But you can't have it
6719000	6721000	But you really want it
6721000	6723000	So when you do have it, you just go all out
6723000	6725000	Well, you know, the same
6725000	6727000	The sort of logic
6727000	6729000	Applies to just about anything that people are told they can't do
6729000	6731000	Like, okay
6731000	6733000	For example
6733000	6735000	Let's actually use the recent
6735000	6737000	Prop 8 crap
6737000	6739000	People are told they can't do something, what happens?
6739000	6741000	People come out and force and protest it, right?
6741000	6743000	And people
6743000	6745000	They get it done
6745000	6747000	While they can't or find other ways to get it done
6747000	6749000	That's what I'm saying is that
6749000	6751000	It's there, you know what I mean?
6751000	6753000	Whenever someone says you can't do something
6753000	6755000	That's a very big part of human nature
6755000	6757000	That indignation that someone has
6757000	6759000	The audacity to tell you you can't do something
6759000	6761000	You know?
6761000	6763000	Ever since we were little kids, don't you agree, Rob?
6763000	6765000	Oh yeah, I mean, you know, and it's funny
6765000	6767000	Because, you know, sometimes for laughs I'll go read
6767000	6769000	You know, specifically you're talking about Prop 8
6769000	6771000	Which obviously is an issue I'm quite passionate about
6771000	6773000	If you don't know why, you know, you need to listen to the show more
6773000	6775000	But here's the thing
6775000	6777000	Is that I'll sometimes follow it on one of the local news sites
6777000	6779000	Where people can comment on it
6779000	6781000	A lot of comments I see are
6781000	6783000	They report on this issue too much
6783000	6785000	It seems like every day you're reporting on some protest
6785000	6787000	That's because people are not going to shut up
6787000	6789000	About this, ever
6789000	6791000	You take away people's rights
6791000	6793000	They're not going to be happy about it
6793000	6795000	We're not going to shut up
6795000	6797000	Until it's equal
6797000	6799000	But my point was
6799000	6801000	I know, I'm sorry, I got on a tangent
6801000	6803000	But no, that actually has to go with what I was saying
6803000	6805000	Is that you tell people they can't do something
6805000	6807000	And that's going to rise up indignation
6807000	6809000	You know, people
6809000	6811000	Don't want to be controlled
6811000	6813000	People don't want to be told no
6813000	6815000	People, you know
6815000	6817000	And the reason why I'm comparing
6817000	6819000	Something as strong as a civil rights movement
6819000	6821000	To something as arbitrary as food
6821000	6823000	You know
6823000	6825000	Is that it all comes from the same
6825000	6827000	The same sort of
6827000	6829000	You know, even if you may not consciously recognize it
6829000	6831000	It all comes from
6831000	6833000	Someone's telling me no
6833000	6835000	I don't want to be told no
6835000	6837000	I can have this if I want to
6837000	6839000	It's a necessity
6839000	6841000	You know what I mean
6841000	6843000	And I think that's why
6843000	6845000	People have a problem with
6845000	6847000	Bad language because we're taught
6847000	6849000	That it's bad and that we shouldn't say it
6849000	6851000	So what do you think
6851000	6853000	The first thing that people learn in other languages
6853000	6855000	Is curse words
6855000	6857000	Don't be gay Sparky, don't be gay
6857000	6859000	Or
6859000	6861000	You know, why do you think little kids
6861000	6863000	Think it's so awesome to go and sneak around
6863000	6865000	And do stuff behind their parents' back
6865000	6867000	Because they know their parents are gonna make a big deal
6867000	6869000	Out of it, it's part of its attention too
6869000	6871000	Or, you know, why is it that people
6871000	6873000	Get, you know
6873000	6875000	Let's rate this very R, why do people get turned on
6875000	6877000	Doing it in places that they know they're not supposed to
6877000	6879000	Seriously
6879000	6881000	Like the couple who was doing the
6881000	6883000	Whoa
6883000	6885000	No, for real, there was a contest that was going around
6885000	6887000	About, you know, who could do it
6887000	6889000	In what area, and there were points you'd get
6889000	6891000	For touching
6891000	6893000	Oh, wasn't that a big radio contest?
6893000	6895000	That was the thing that got them kicked off the air, right
6895000	6897000	Where they had sex in a church or something
6897000	6899000	Yeah, yeah, I remember that
6899000	6901000	But why would it be such a big deal if they weren't allowed
6901000	6903000	Because you're not supposed to have sex in a house of God
6903000	6905000	Exactly
6905000	6907000	When you're yelling, oh God, oh God, that's not praying
6907000	6909000	So, really
6909000	6911000	Where would the allure be
6911000	6913000	Of the kid sneaking around behind his parents' back
6913000	6915000	If there's no harm in it
6915000	6917000	If the parents are gonna be like
6917000	6919000	Okay
6919000	6921000	Do you see what my logic is?
6921000	6923000	No, I get it
6923000	6925000	I'm gonna be like that with my kid
6925000	6927000	It's not that I'm gonna
6927000	6929000	I'm going to teach them the right and wrong
6929000	6931000	But video games are video games
6931000	6933000	My whole plan is to teach them the difference between
6933000	6935000	Reality and unreality
6935000	6937000	And I also don't care if they curse
6937000	6939000	Alright, obviously
6939000	6941000	This is soliciting a huge
6941000	6943000	Response from chat
6943000	6945000	I wanna read some of the chat comments we have here
6945000	6947000	Game Guru says
6947000	6949000	I'll allow my kid to play any game
6949000	6951000	If it's rated for older people
6951000	6953000	Superdude says no flower for my kids
6953000	6955000	Can't play a game
6955000	6957000	As tame as flower
6957000	6959000	SSJ100Matt says
6959000	6961000	Jamie will teach your kids to play pinball
6961000	6963000	Hell fuck yeah
6963000	6965000	AcidicVampire says
6965000	6967000	And all the lyrics to Pinball Wizard
6967000	6969000	AcidicVampire says Jamie wants to play manhunt with her kids
6969000	6971000	No, I wanna play good games with my kids
6971000	6973000	GS68 says
6973000	6975000	If your kids can differentiate between reality and fantasy
6975000	6977000	At an early age, by all means, let them play
6977000	6979000	Game Guru says
6979000	6981000	Government is full of idiots
6981000	6983000	And I don't want idiots to raise kids
6983000	6985000	DeakMan
6985000	6987000	Has an interesting plan in chat
6987000	6989000	Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com
6989000	6991000	Live on Sunday night says
6991000	6993000	When my girl gets older
6993000	6995000	I plan on setting up an NES in her room
6995000	6997000	And only letting her play NES games for two months
6997000	6999000	Then SNES for two months
6999000	7001000	And so on
7001000	7003000	So she gets an appreciation for classics
7003000	7005000	Maybe
7005000	7007000	Maybe I also have this expectation
7007000	7009000	That my child will be like me and my husband were
7009000	7011000	And not be stupid
7011000	7013000	Because I've watched all kinds of crap
7013000	7015000	And played all kinds of crap
7015000	7017000	And as long as I
7017000	7019000	As long as the difference was
7019000	7021000	I don't think a five year old should play Silent Hill
7021000	7023000	Right
7023000	7025000	But what five year old is gonna be interested
7025000	7027000	In Silent Hill
7027000	7029000	Right
7029000	7031000	But like, you know, when I was
7031000	7033000	For example, I don't look at it any different
7033000	7035000	As me being allowed to read
7035000	7037000	The books I was allowed to read as a child
7037000	7039000	You know
7039000	7041000	The Scarlet Letter had to do
7041000	7043000	With, you know
7043000	7045000	A woman conceiving an
7045000	7047000	Illegitimate child by having an affair
7047000	7049000	How old were we when we read this?
7049000	7051000	You know
7051000	7053000	How about the Grapes of Wrath dealing with
7053000	7055000	You know, the depression
7055000	7057000	That's certainly an adult theme
7057000	7059000	I read Atlas Shrugged when I was in ninth grade
7059000	7061000	You know, that actually
7061000	7063000	Deals with a lot of sex
7063000	7065000	Catcher in the Rye is like the quintessential
7065000	7067000	Sophomore year of high school book
7067000	7069000	Right? I never read it
7069000	7071000	A lot of kids around here
7071000	7073000	I read The Odyssey
7073000	7075000	When I was in middle school
7075000	7077000	I read The Inferno when I was in middle school
7077000	7079000	Alright
7079000	7081000	But I look at it
7081000	7083000	It's gotta be down to the parent's
7083000	7085000	Judgment. I look at it the same way
7085000	7087000	And yeah, they're classic books
7087000	7089000	Whatever people
7089000	7091000	Situations dealt with are
7091000	7093000	For a different level
7093000	7095000	Of intellect and maturity
7095000	7097000	And certainly, if I don't detect
7097000	7099000	The level of maturity that I think is gonna
7099000	7101000	Be able to handle that
7101000	7103000	Then, I'm, you know, I'm not
7103000	7105000	Going to be the one to introduce it to them
7105000	7107000	You know what I mean?
7107000	7109000	If it comes out that, yeah
7109000	7111000	I was at my friend's house and I saw
7111000	7113000	This thing, then I'll be like, okay
7113000	7115000	Well, let's have a talk. You know, that's not real
7115000	7117000	Right? Okay, don't do that
7117000	7119000	Let's get some chat comments. This is a great discussion
7119000	7121000	Breslull says, Jamie read Playboy
7121000	7123000	Too. I don't know about that
7123000	7125000	For the articles, though, right?
7125000	7127000	Bochikawa in chat says, Catcher in the Rye is like 6th grade now
7127000	7129000	They grow up so fast
7129000	7131000	Dan Shadow says, you know with all these rainbows
7131000	7133000	And unicorns, 5 year olds will really be into
7133000	7135000	Diablo 3
7135000	7137000	Possibly
7137000	7139000	Alright, some more serious comments in chat
7139000	7141000	Deathwishing says, I personally think it's good
7141000	7143000	To show kids M-rated games
7143000	7145000	Because it shows like Grand Theft Auto
7145000	7147000	Because it shows them that if they do something wrong
7147000	7149000	They get fucked by the police
7149000	7151000	I don't know about that
7151000	7153000	And what people are taking out of context
7153000	7155000	There was an XD after that
7155000	7157000	So I think there was a little tongue in cheek
7157000	7159000	But I also think that what some people are taking out of context
7159000	7161000	Is that I'm not gonna take
7161000	7163000	A 5 year old, like I said
7163000	7165000	And play Silent Hill with them
7165000	7167000	It's a lot of it is parents
7167000	7169000	Discretion
7169000	7171000	And, you know, like when
7171000	7173000	When my little sister, okay
7173000	7175000	My little sister was little, little
7175000	7177000	We played video games with her
7177000	7179000	You know, to those days it was
7179000	7181000	Nintendo and Super Nintendo, but we sat down
7181000	7183000	And played with her
7183000	7185000	And, you know, she knew what was real
7185000	7187000	And what wasn't, like she knew that if she
7187000	7189000	Sat on a sewer pipe, she likely wouldn't go into
7189000	7191000	A cavern with gold coins
7191000	7193000	You know
7193000	7195000	There's
7195000	7197000	There's a difference, you know, you just have to
7197000	7199000	Trust sometimes that
7199000	7201000	The kids are smarter than you give them credit for
7201000	7203000	And I actually had this discussion
7203000	7205000	With Dan's stepmother
7205000	7207000	And I'm not gonna go into too detailed, but I was like
7207000	7209000	We can't expect the government to do
7209000	7211000	A parent's job for them
7211000	7213000	The parent's responsibility
7213000	7215000	Is to that child until they are
7215000	7217000	Of age and can leave
7217000	7219000	From
7219000	7221000	A person is a parent before
7221000	7223000	Conception
7223000	7225000	That's how I see it
7225000	7227000	A couple last comments from chat here
7227000	7229000	And then we'll try to go ahead and move on for tonight
7229000	7231000	We're having a good discussion, and I'm sure we'll probably get some emails
7231000	7233000	About this one, can't wait
7233000	7235000	Superdude in chat says, if kids can get their hands
7235000	7237000	Into R-rated movies, it's not that hard
7237000	7239000	For them to get the M-rated games either
7239000	7241000	Kids will always find a way to get the M-rated games
7241000	7243000	Because they know M-rated games are the shit
7243000	7245000	Deathwishing in chat
7245000	7247000	Last comment here I'm gonna read
7247000	7249000	I play video games and I haven't killed anything except
7249000	7251000	Ants, fucking ants
7251000	7253000	There you go
7253000	7255000	Alright, if you want to join in
7255000	7257000	On our chat sometime
7257000	7259000	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com
7259000	7261000	Live here on a Sunday night
7261000	7263000	But for right now, obviously this oversensorship
7263000	7265000	I have to agree with Marissa
7265000	7267000	What did she say?
7267000	7269000	When I was 12 I found my mom's
7269000	7271000	College level human sexuality book
7271000	7273000	Only damage it did was give me some very happy
7273000	7275000	Boyfriends later in life
7275000	7277000	Alright
7277000	7279000	Look, we gotta make some time here since
7279000	7281000	We did just read about a really ludicrous
7281000	7283000	Story, obviously these types of stories
7283000	7285000	Put us into a fit of rage
7285000	7287000	This is the part of the show that we like to call
7287000	7289000	The FUs of the Week
7303000	7305000	My first FU goes to people
7305000	7307000	Making assumptions
7307000	7309000	This is
7309000	7311000	Directed
7311000	7313000	Towards certain people
7313000	7315000	In my house
7315000	7317000	Who
7317000	7319000	Will not
7319000	7321000	Name names
7321000	7323000	And also
7323000	7325000	I'd actually have to direct that towards
7325000	7327000	Myself too because I've made a couple of
7327000	7329000	Assumptions too
7329000	7331000	My second
7331000	7333000	I was about to say my second assumption
7333000	7335000	My second FU
7335000	7337000	Actually has to do
7337000	7339000	With semis trying to do
7339000	7341000	U-turns and intersections
7341000	7343000	Too small for them
7343000	7345000	And my third one
7345000	7347000	Has to do with
7347000	7349000	The Watchmen movie
7349000	7351000	It should have been a fucking miniseries, not a movie
7351000	7353000	That means I didn't like it
7353000	7355000	I just meant the story
7355000	7357000	Would have been better told through a miniseries
7357000	7359000	You just wanted more of it
7359000	7361000	I wanted it better paced
7361000	7363000	I'll put it that way
7363000	7365000	It needed better pacing
7365000	7367000	Alright, I don't really have a lot of FUs
7367000	7369000	I guess FU to Daylight Savings Time
7369000	7371000	Does that really screw it up my weekend
7371000	7373000	Otherwise, just an FU to the fact
7373000	7375000	That I'm flying to Washington DC this
7375000	7377000	Week and I'm only going to be there for a day
7377000	7379000	I'm flying there on Tuesday
7379000	7381000	I'm going to be there Wednesday, I'm flying back on Thursday
7381000	7383000	So FU to not getting to spend quality time
7383000	7385000	In a far away town
7385000	7387000	FU to Couple Stones because they suck to walk on
7387000	7389000	They're round and awkward
7391000	7393000	Round and awkward
7393000	7395000	Fair enough
7395000	7397000	That's going to do it for the FUs of the Week
7397000	7399000	Segment we've done for the past
7399000	7401000	Many, many years here on Orange Lounge Radio
7401000	7403000	Let's get back into some gaming news
7403000	7405000	We do have the mailbag coming up and the Skype line
7405000	7407000	Soon enough as well where we'll be taking your calls
7407000	7409000	1877 Game OLR
7409000	7411000	But not just yet, we'll let you know when the phones are open
7411000	7413000	We do still have some more stories we want to get to before then
7413000	7415000	Right, Jamie?
7415000	7417000	Yes, and this one's about Penny Arcade
7417000	7419000	Washington State has passed a bill
7419000	7421000	Which is pretty much like Damn You Guys Rock
7421000	7423000	To the Penny Arcade founders
7423000	7425000	Jerry Hulkins and Mike Krahulik
7425000	7427000	Is that how it's pronounced?
7427000	7429000	But basically they were honored for their contribution
7429000	7431000	To their state's industry
7431000	7433000	Because there are about
7433000	7435000	48 video game companies
7435000	7437000	In Washington
7437000	7439000	And also they run
7439000	7441000	A really, really excellent
7441000	7443000	Charity, the Child's Play
7443000	7445000	Which has raised over 4.5 million dollars
7445000	7447000	For children's hospitals
7447000	7449000	So very good
7449000	7451000	And they also bring people to the state
7451000	7453000	Like Penny Arcade Expo does
7453000	7455000	Yeah, and just obviously
7455000	7457000	Yeah, Penny Arcade Expo is probably a huge
7457000	7459000	Economy boost for the state
7459000	7461000	Especially for the restaurants
7461000	7463000	And the bars
7463000	7465000	They're very happy about that
7465000	7467000	Well, you may remember me talking about
7467000	7469000	Eat, Lead, The Return of Matt Hazard
7469000	7471000	A game that came out
7471000	7473000	A couple weeks ago, actually last week
7473000	7475000	And kind of
7475000	7477000	Was a parody on the old
7477000	7479000	Video game genre
7479000	7481000	Everything from old
7481000	7483000	Shareware games
7483000	7485000	You know, RPGs and that kind of stuff
7485000	7487000	Well now, they have a
7487000	7489000	New Flash game that you can try out
7489000	7491000	That actually recreates one of these
7491000	7493000	Fictional games in
7493000	7495000	The history of Matt Hazard
7495000	7497000	And the game of course
7497000	7499000	Is Matt Hazard
7499000	7501000	In Land Extreme
7501000	7503000	Alpha Advance
7503000	7505000	And it's a
7505000	7507000	Game you can check out at
7507000	7509000	MattHazardExtreme.com
7509000	7511000	Kind of a parody of a 16-bit
7511000	7513000	Game
7513000	7515000	And they have a nice photo of Matt Hazard
7515000	7517000	Destroying what looks like a robotic
7517000	7519000	Pegasus
7519000	7521000	Huh
7521000	7523000	You know, Dan Shadow in chat says
7523000	7525000	Matt Hazard is not good, quite simply
7525000	7527000	Um
7527000	7529000	Were you a fan of Eat, Lead, eventually?
7529000	7531000	I know a couple weeks ago we were playing it
7531000	7533000	It was okay, it wasn't great
7533000	7535000	The game itself is funny, but the way it
7535000	7537000	Plays is kinda crap
7537000	7539000	So it's just, it's not
7539000	7541000	I don't know, it was like
7541000	7543000	A good idea on paper and then they tried to
7543000	7545000	Make it and it just wasn't working
7545000	7547000	It didn't work
7547000	7549000	Well, one game that's worked for some people, I know this game
7549000	7551000	Has their fans, I'm gonna be honest, I've never played this game
7551000	7553000	But Eve Online does have a very
7553000	7555000	Rabid fan base, I know we have a couple callers that play this game
7555000	7557000	Um, online, hey guess what?
7557000	7559000	There is an expansion coming out, I'm sure the fans
7559000	7561000	Of the game must know this, it's Eve Online
7561000	7563000	And I'm probably gonna butcher the name
7563000	7565000	Of this, but it's Apokripa
7565000	7567000	Apokripa? I don't know how exactly
7567000	7569000	You say that, Apokripa
7569000	7571000	Apokripa, I don't know how you say that
7571000	7573000	But that is the expansion that's
7573000	7575000	Coming out this week, and apparently
7575000	7577000	It's gonna kinda change some things about the game
7577000	7579000	If you're a new player in the game
7579000	7581000	You get some new epic mission arcs that are
7581000	7583000	Gonna help guide you through the different factions
7583000	7585000	In the Eve Online game, and so this means it's gonna be
7585000	7587000	A little more new player friendly, probably to
7587000	7589000	Address some of those things that Eve Online is too damn
7589000	7591000	Difficult, or I've heard a lot of people have gotten into
7591000	7593000	This game and they get blown away because I guess the whole thing
7593000	7595000	Is PVP, so this will kinda help
7595000	7597000	But if you're a veteran player and you wanna get into
7597000	7599000	This game, there will be some new wormholes
7599000	7601000	That are gonna show up in the game
7601000	7603000	And you'll get some new enemies and some new items
7603000	7605000	And things of that nature
7605000	7607000	The enemies will now change their tactics
7607000	7609000	Based on your performance
7609000	7611000	They might even call in backup, change
7611000	7613000	Some targets, use debuffs
7613000	7615000	Whatever they're gonna have to do to
7615000	7617000	Blow you up
7617000	7619000	So check out that Eve Online expansion
7619000	7621000	For Apokripa

7655000	7657000	Hello to everyone
7657000	7659000	At the Orange Lounge, including random guests
7659000	7661000	If there is one this week
7661000	7663000	That would just be Harvey, who is invisible
7663000	7665000	Or Pikachu, if you're watching Justin TV
7665000	7667000	We do have Pikachu and he's armed with a sword tonight
7667000	7669000	Which Loki's kind of sitting in front of us
7669000	7671000	He can't really see, but he does have a sword
7671000	7673000	That's Pimp and Pikachu
7673000	7675000	That's right, with his pimp hat tonight
7675000	7677000	The other week you were talking about British tele
7677000	7679000	It wasn't worth watching on the BBC
7679000	7681000	If you can access the BBC iPlayer
7681000	7683000	Please, please, please make some time to watch
7683000	7685000	A phenomenal new series called Being Human
7685000	7687000	It's about a vampire, werewolf, and a ghost
7687000	7689000	That share a house in Bristol
7689000	7691000	It really is the best thing on TV at the moment
7691000	7693000	It was Master Chef
7693000	7695000	But that's finished now
7695000	7697000	I would love to know your thoughts
7697000	7699000	I feel like I should inject something
7699000	7701000	Game related here, so here's my gaming week
7701000	7703000	Slash month
7703000	7705000	COD World at War on the Wii
7705000	7707000	Tony the Tiger says it's great
7707000	7709000	Not sure if Tony the Tiger owns a Wii though
7709000	7711000	I'm going now, bye, love from Chard
7711000	7713000	Age 23 and a half
7713000	7715000	No wait, I'm nearly 33, fuck
7715000	7717000	Where did that come from?
7717000	7719000	That is what the email said, by the way
7719000	7721000	Which was beautiful
7721000	7725000	Wow, the next one's big
7725000	7727000	Thank you spazzinator
7727000	7729000	Hi folks, if you three didn't mind
7729000	7731000	I have a few questions for you
7731000	7733000	First of all, as of right now
7733000	7735000	I'm trying to change up
7735000	7737000	How my 360 Elite is hooked up to my TV
7737000	7739000	Mainly for convenience sake
7739000	7741000	More than anything
7741000	7743000	However, I'm running into issues
7743000	7745000	Right now it's hooked up to my 32 inch
7745000	7747000	1080i HD TV via component cables
7747000	7749000	That like to be hooked up by HDMI
7749000	7751000	And passing through an HDMI switch
7751000	7753000	On its way to my TV
7753000	7755000	As nearly as I can tell, it should be a no brainer
7755000	7757000	All this
7757000	7759000	All this seating seems correct
7759000	7761000	And it's just a matter of swapping cables
7761000	7763000	However, every time I do attempt to switch my TV
7763000	7765000	It tells me it's receiving an invalid signal
7765000	7767000	I read the 360's instructions
7767000	7769000	And it seems like I'm doing everything right
7769000	7771000	Am I overlooking something obvious here
7771000	7773000	Before you say it, I know I won't see an improvement
7773000	7775000	In picture, I'd just like to
7775000	7777000	Like the convenience of using my
7777000	7779000	HDMI switch to switch
7779000	7781000	Between my cable box PS3 and PS3
7781000	7783000	Um, you said PS3 twice
7785000	7787000	Anyone care to tackle that?
7787000	7789000	I ran out for just a minute
7789000	7791000	That was the heart of the question
7791000	7793000	Because I wanted to get a refill on my coffee
7793000	7795000	Something about not getting the right picture?
7795000	7797000	He wants to hook up his Xbox 360
7797000	7799000	Elite through the HDMI switch
7799000	7801000	But it's getting an invalid signal
7801000	7803000	Um
7803000	7805000	Hmm
7805000	7807000	I'm not sure, this might be a question
7807000	7809000	Better left for a Best Buy employee
7809000	7811000	Do you have any thoughts, Loki?
7811000	7813000	I'm not sure, it's okay
7813000	7815000	You should just hook it up and it should work
7815000	7817000	Yeah, it should just kind of work
7817000	7819000	It should be via component cables
7819000	7821000	But I want it to be hooked up by HDMI
7821000	7823000	But it should be a no brainer
7823000	7825000	Yeah, it should be a no brainer
7825000	7827000	Every time I do attempt it, my switch TV says I'm getting an invalid signal
7827000	7829000	Try new cables
7829000	7831000	Yeah, it's gotta be the switch, the cable
7831000	7833000	Something weird's going on there
7833000	7835000	You're right, it should be a no brainer
7835000	7837000	It ought to just work
7837000	7839000	Should just be able to plug it in and go
7839000	7841000	Um, some thoughts from our chat room
7841000	7843000	Because of course when we can't think of the answer
7843000	7845000	Usually our chatters can
7845000	7847000	Because Microsoft wants you to buy a new cable
7847000	7849000	AcidicVampire says you might have to use a
7849000	7851000	Microsoft HDMI cable
7851000	7853000	Nah, it doesn't matter, it's just an HDMI cable
7853000	7855000	But it sounds like, I don't know, some issue
7855000	7857000	If you've got cheap cables though
7857000	7859000	Then that might be the problem
7859000	7861000	We actually pretty much use them
7861000	7863000	I think we pretty much stick with the monster cables at my house
7863000	7865000	Monsters, crap
7865000	7867000	But just any HDMI cable
7867000	7869000	Maybe that one doesn't
7869000	7871000	I don't know if you've used that HDMI cable on anything else
7871000	7873000	Maybe I've had issues
7873000	7875000	It might be just poor shielded or something
7875000	7877000	For some reason it's getting the wrong signal
7877000	7879000	To it
7879000	7881000	There's another thing you can do
7881000	7883000	Maybe with it hooked up
7883000	7885000	Where you can reset the
7885000	7887000	Your video settings
7887000	7889000	On it and you might try that
7889000	7891000	Maybe booting up with the HDMI cable
7891000	7893000	I think you hold
7893000	7895000	I want to say it's either the right shoulder button
7895000	7897000	Or the right trigger and why
7897000	7899000	While you're booting up the system
7899000	7901000	I'm sure if you look on Game Facts or something like that
7901000	7903000	One of them will reset the video
7903000	7905000	The other will format your hard drive
7905000	7907000	No, one will not format your hard drive
7907000	7909000	That's something different
7909000	7911000	That's a reset
7911000	7913000	There's another one to reset your cache also
7913000	7915000	Yeah, I think it's
7915000	7917000	The shoulder button or the right trigger
7917000	7919000	It's one of those and why
7919000	7921000	Oh, is the little thing on the
7921000	7923000	Oh no, it doesn't, nevermind
7923000	7925000	I'm thinking the little switch on the back of the core
7925000	7927000	And it's also important that you have to turn on your console
7927000	7929000	With your controller if you do that
7929000	7931000	But
7931000	7933000	I don't know why that would affect anything
7933000	7935000	But maybe you could try that and see if that works
7935000	7937000	Other thoughts from our chat
7937000	7939000	Again, thank you guys very much
7939000	7941000	SSJ100Matt suggested he update it
7941000	7943000	Because they just updated the HDMI on Xbox Live
7943000	7945000	AcidicVampire says
7945000	7947000	I tried a generic cable and it didn't work
7947000	7949000	But it works on my Playstation 3
7949000	7951000	Dan Shadow says don't buy monsters
7951000	7953000	SSJ100Matt says I got an HDMI cable
7953000	7955000	For less than a dollar and it works great
7955000	7957000	Tony Tony Tony suggests
7957000	7959000	HDMI input
7959000	7961000	Cablewholesale.com, that's a good place
7961000	7963000	To check for cables on HDMI
7963000	7965000	I think this might be the best advice yet
7965000	7967000	TigerClaw suggests maybe it's a handshake issue
7967000	7969000	The HDMI switch must support
7969000	7971000	HDCP
7971000	7973000	So maybe the switch is not
7973000	7975000	Good enough, that's a good thought
7975000	7977000	And then lastly
7977000	7979000	Another thing to test, SSJ100Matt says
7979000	7981000	Try plugging the HDMI cable directly into the TV
7981000	7983000	And then a recruit
7983000	7985000	Who has not changed their name
7985000	7987000	They need to make sure their 360 is configured correctly
7987000	7989000	So wow, that's like a million different options
7989000	7991000	Hope it works out for you buddy
7991000	7993000	Let us know what happens
7993000	7995000	Next part
7995000	7997000	In regards to last week's story about the lesbian
7997000	7999000	That got banned from Xbox Live after reporting being
7999000	8001000	Harassed by others
8001000	8003000	I have a bit of an odd nagging question which honestly
8003000	8005000	I'm surprised no one else has asked
8005000	8007000	Not to suggest in any way shape or form
8007000	8009000	That Microsoft or the bullies were right
8009000	8011000	They obviously weren't by a long shot
8011000	8013000	But what exactly is the point of
8013000	8015000	One's orientation on one's online profile
8015000	8017000	On either Xbox Live or PSN
8017000	8019000	Granted, I'm still fairly
8019000	8021000	New to the whole Xbox Live scene and all
8021000	8023000	But as nearly as I can tell the bio section
8023000	8025000	Of Xbox Live profile is geared
8025000	8027000	To inputting info about yourself
8027000	8029000	That's gaming or gamer lifestyle related
8029000	8031000	Such as what systems you
8031000	8033000	Own, what game genre
8033000	8035000	Players
8035000	8037000	How long one has been gaming, etc
8037000	8039000	I don't see how one's orientation
8039000	8041000	Regardless of what it is has anything to do with gaming
8041000	8043000	True
8043000	8045000	As I stated on the show last year
8045000	8047000	The one where there was a talk about the so called offensive
8047000	8049000	Retooling of space invaders for the art
8049000	8051000	commentary purposes
8051000	8053000	I'm all for the first amendment rights
8053000	8055000	Regardless of whether or not others are offended
8055000	8057000	But somehow talk of one's orientation
8057000	8059000	On Xbox Live seems a bit out of place
8059000	8061000	Although it's not perfect
8061000	8063000	The only analogy that comes to mind
8063000	8065000	At the moment would be like
8065000	8067000	Going to an AA meeting and talking about all things
8067000	8069000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
8069000	8071000	With the analogy AA meetings are for dealing
8071000	8073000	With alcoholic issues not TMNT
8073000	8075000	And as nearly as I figure
8075000	8077000	Bios on Xbox Live profile are meant to be gaming
8077000	8079000	Related
8079000	8081000	Am I missing something here? Am I way
8081000	8083000	Off the mark or missing the point here?
8083000	8085000	I do hope that she
8085000	8087000	Gets her profile back and that she's not turned off
8087000	8089000	From online gaming
8089000	8091000	Frankly even though there are A holes
8091000	8093000	Online gaming on Xbox Live or PSN
8093000	8095000	Can be a lot of fun
8095000	8097000	I kind of get what
8097000	8099000	It's Spaz who sent the emailer
8099000	8101000	I kind of get what Spaz is saying here
8101000	8103000	About the whole like you know why did she
8103000	8105000	Even need to say it in the first place and you know
8105000	8107000	I don't get it, you don't get it
8107000	8109000	I don't think any of us really understand why she has to
8109000	8111000	Say it but at the same time
8111000	8113000	If that's what she wants to do
8113000	8115000	If that's what she wants to put in her profile
8115000	8117000	Shouldn't she be able to put it?
8117000	8119000	I mean it's not like she put I like to stab kittens in the face
8119000	8121000	She's a lesbian
8121000	8123000	I wonder though if
8123000	8125000	I love the stab kittens in the face would be
8125000	8127000	Considered offensive and if that would get banned
8127000	8129000	You probably would I wouldn't try it
8129000	8131000	I mean if that's what she really
8131000	8133000	Wants to put in her profile
8133000	8135000	Who am I to judge?
8135000	8137000	Maybe I should create a profile a silver account
8137000	8139000	Or something like that that says I love the stab kittens
8139000	8141000	In the face
8141000	8143000	My profile on Xbox Live says I host a radio show
8143000	8145000	On the internet called Orange Lounge Radio.com
8145000	8147000	Oh my god banned
8147000	8149000	Do you think half the people that punch me in the face
8149000	8151000	In Street Fighter 4 and just kill me
8151000	8153000	To the ground do you think they give a shit?
8153000	8155000	That I'm another person with a podcast on the internet
8155000	8157000	How many people actually read their profiles?
8157000	8159000	Welcome to the Fantasy Zone get ready
8159000	8161000	And do you think
8161000	8163000	99% of the people that you run into
8163000	8165000	On Xbox Live know what the fuck that is?
8165000	8167000	Only the old school gamers
8167000	8169000	Exactly
8169000	8171000	You know what it's from
8171000	8173000	I know what it's from it's from Space Harrier
8173000	8175000	Not Fantasy Zone common misconception but still
8175000	8177000	You know what I mean
8177000	8179000	Oh completely off topic I actually found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone
8179000	8181000	Congrats
8181000	8183000	You're a winner
8183000	8185000	I am
8185000	8187000	Ponzi scheme in chat says
8187000	8189000	I listened to the interview on Major Nelson's podcast
8189000	8191000	Microsoft is being ultra PC with this issue
8191000	8193000	Of course
8193000	8195000	Of course they have to be ultra PC with this issue
8195000	8197000	They don't want to get the pink mafia
8197000	8199000	Sicked on them which I completely understand
8199000	8201000	And obviously
8201000	8203000	I think they realize this situation
8203000	8205000	Has been blown completely out of
8205000	8207000	Proportion thank you internet
8207000	8209000	But it's something that needs to be addressed
8209000	8211000	So it'll be interesting to see what happens
8211000	8213000	As a result
8213000	8215000	Alright ready?
8215000	8217000	Next email
8217000	8219000	I'm sorry I have to say this one other comment from Ponzi scheme in chat
8219000	8221000	I like Olive Garden's never ending pasta
8221000	8223000	Will I get banned for that?
8223000	8225000	No but you might get fat
8225000	8227000	Or diarrhea
8227000	8229000	Hey OLR crew
8229000	8231000	I've listened to your show for the past 3 years or so
8231000	8233000	And I thought it would be nice to give you some thanks
8233000	8235000	Thank you for helping me get through my customer service job
8235000	8237000	For entertaining me on long bus rides
8237000	8239000	And for keeping me sane
8239000	8241000	Your podcast was the first one I ever listened to
8241000	8243000	And it's one that I look forward to listening to
8243000	8245000	Every week
8245000	8247000	There's another reason why I'm sending this email
8247000	8249000	You see I am sick and tired of people sending emails
8249000	8251000	With crappy punctuation, grammar, and spelling
8251000	8253000	Laziness is no excuse
8253000	8255000	I thought it would be nice for Dark Sakura to finally get
8255000	8257000	A well written nearly error free email for once
8257000	8259000	In addition
8259000	8261000	Just for the sake of proof of concept
8261000	8263000	This email is written from my iPod touch with auto correct
8263000	8265000	Turned off so you see people
8265000	8267000	It can be done
8267000	8269000	I love you
8269000	8271000	Alright I'm stepping off my soapbox
8271000	8273000	Maybe one day I'll email you with something video game related
8273000	8275000	But that will have to wait for another day
8275000	8277000	Midnight skies
8277000	8279000	This presentation of Grammar Nazi has concluded
8279000	8281000	We now return you to your Orange Jones radio already in progress
8281000	8283000	Actually I've found no errors
8283000	8285000	Congratulations

8297000	8299000	Thank you thank you thank you
8299000	8301000	Midnight skies
8301000	8303000	And I think it was Sasa that pointed this out to me before
8303000	8305000	But I tend to read the emails like they're sent to me
8305000	8309000	Including you know bad grammar run on sentences and all
8309000	8313000	So you can tell from the fluid way in which this email was read
8313000	8317000	That it was properly phrased and properly punctuated
8317000	8319000	That it didn't make my heart hurt
8319000	8321000	Okay what's the email on his name Midnight Skies
8321000	8323000	Midnight Skies
8323000	8325000	Congratulations
8331000	8333000	You get a cookie
8333000	8337000	This email is getting saved never delete it or I'll stab a kitten in the face
8337000	8339000	Alright any more emails
8339000	8341000	Next
8341000	8343000	This is an inquiry email
8343000	8345000	Via orangejonesradio.com
8345000	8349000	From oh dude we have that cool thing set up don't we
8349000	8351000	What?
8351000	8353000	I guess this is through the website
8353000	8355000	Oh no this is me just going
8355000	8357000	Okay
8357000	8359000	It's from Irene
8359000	8361000	Let's just do the rest of the radio show
8361000	8363000	That was my tribute to Irene the fart princess
8363000	8367000	Hey there OLR crew this be Lexo and Yo
8367000	8369000	Or Leoxon Lao Shen
8369000	8373000	I think it's Leo Shen that's what I've always said
8373000	8375000	First of all
8375000	8379000	First off I'd like to say that OLR has got to be my favorite video game show of all time
8379000	8381000	That aside
8381000	8385000	Recently on your show I've heard the constant complaint that industry fighter force Seth
8385000	8387000	The final boss is a cheap bitch
8387000	8391000	I'd like to show you all a fighting game boss that is even worse than Seth
8391000	8399000	Someone with the definition of a cheap bitch in fighting games who has the dreaded SNK boss syndrome times 10
8399000	8403000	Okay so I need to take a look at this
8403000	8405000	Oh fuck
8405000	8409000	I'd like to mention that the boss in Tatsunoko vs Capcom is also a cheap bitch
8409000	8411000	Yes
8411000	8415000	We are looking at a video here in studio of a fight from Arcana Heart 2
8415000	8417000	That's brand new
8417000	8419000	And I'm trying to, the video is buffering
8419000	8421000	It's all chick fighting
8421000	8423000	Well that's not anything new
8423000	8425000	Alright
8425000	8427000	Alright so yes I'm looking at this boss fight
8427000	8429000	Yes we're watching
8429000	8431000	It's pretty
8431000	8433000	I mean I can't falter for that
8433000	8435000	She's way too covered though
8435000	8437000	At least the one on the left is
8437000	8439000	So the video is a little bit of a low quality
8439000	8441000	That's what I was saying, the one on the right
8441000	8443000	Alright anyway I'm sorry
8443000	8445000	Exactly that's what I'm saying
8445000	8447000	That's her bouncy
8447000	8449000	Alright sorry what's the rest of the email
8449000	8453000	I'm actually just watching the, oh my god, cheap bitch much
8453000	8455000	Damn
8455000	8457000	Okay so
8457000	8461000	They have a special pink controller that you can get for this
8461000	8463000	Who cares I want it
8463000	8465000	I want this game
8465000	8467000	I think I'm gonna have to get this game
8467000	8469000	Alright
8469000	8473000	So anyway, back to the email that was currently in progress
8473000	8477000	She happens to come from the all girl fighter called Sugoi Arcana Heart 2
8477000	8479000	Sugoi means wow
8479000	8481000	Her name is
8481000	8483000	I think that's what Loki said when he saw those boobies
8483000	8487000	Her name is Paraslycia
8487000	8491000	And she just happens to be an elven woman who can summon four elemental spheres to take you down
8491000	8493000	What makes her so bad you may ask
8493000	8495000	Well first off she has an auto regen super meter
8495000	8501000	Some special attacks that when they connect it spells an instant 70% or more off your health depleted
8501000	8506000	Has a special where she can restore most of her health and you can't really stop her from doing it all too well
8506000	8511000	And she has a nasty little instant kill ultra move as demonstrated over and over in the video included
8511000	8516000	She also has a bit jiggle of her breasts when she unleashes her special moves
8516000	8520000	Although to some people that wouldn't hurt to see when their ass is handed to them
8520000	8522000	We did notice that emailer
8522000	8526000	She can be beaten but you need some mad skills to do so
8526000	8528000	The video shows her on normal mode
8528000	8532000	I can honestly say that she's just as bad on easier modes
8532000	8534000	Imagine if Seth was like that OLR
8534000	8540000	I bet some people would have stopped playing Street Fighter 4 arcade mode altogether if Seth was that tough
8540000	8547000	Well you know I do have to mention that Seth is sort of like you know wearing just like a thong type thing
8547000	8550000	I would be fine if she was just wearing just a thong
8550000	8552000	Let her finish
8552000	8555000	Well just wanted to show a boss that would make Seth her bitch
8555000	8559000	Keep up the great work with the show but Seth does gut suck
8559000	8563000	You're fighting game addicted listener Leoshen
8563000	8566000	P.S. this message is brought to you by Sugoi Arcana Hearts 2
8566000	8568000	It's so good you'll slap your mama
8568000	8571000	And of course I love you mama peace out OLR
8571000	8573000	That was a pretty funny email
8573000	8578000	Every other sequel that comes out we should all say Sugoi in front of it
8578000	8580000	Like wow
8580000	8582000	Hey guys
8582000	8584000	Oh sorry I was on the next email
8584000	8588000	Dan Shadow in chat says well who doesn't have a jiggle in their breast when unleashing their special
8588000	8590000	I can't be the only one without problem
8590000	8594000	I think that the next email is from Dan Shadow
8594000	8596000	Oh well then let's hear it
8596000	8600000	Hey guys Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is one of my most cherished games
8600000	8604000	After school my friends and I would go to the local pizza place and just rock that arcade
8604000	8607000	Every day I hope that a new one will be made
8607000	8612000	To get to the point what new Marvel fighters do you think should make it into a new game if one was made today
8612000	8614000	Which characters deserve to get scrapped
8614000	8616000	I personally hope Dante from Devil May Cry
8616000	8619000	The Bionic Commando and Bucky as Captain America would be in it
8619000	8622000	Keep it real guys the cold stone is delicious
8622000	8624000	I want Deadpool
8624000	8627000	I want Deadpool in the Dan fighting game
8627000	8629000	And he has to
8629000	8631000	Could you imagine Deadpool vs. Dan
8631000	8637000	That would be funny as fuck because it would be taunting back and forth the whole time
8637000	8639000	Except Deadpool would pull out a gun
8639000	8642000	I don't have the comic book knowledge to really answer that question from the Marvel standpoint
8642000	8646000	But from the Capcom standpoint I agree with the Bionic Commando guy with the arm
8646000	8648000	That would be pretty hilarious
8648000	8649000	That's a good suggestion
8649000	8651000	He was a helper in the first Marvel vs. Capcom
8651000	8654000	This is who I would see in my dream
8654000	8656000	From Capcom characters
8656000	8659000	I would actually totally believe Strider Hiryu in it
8659000	8662000	But I would actually have a palette swap for Hien
8662000	8664000	From Strider 2
8664000	8668000	Also you should totally have
8668000	8671000	For playable I agree with the new Captain America
8671000	8673000	I agree we should have
8673000	8677000	Well I would totally say put Luke Cage in it
8677000	8679000	How about Arthur from Ghouls and Ghosts
8679000	8683000	He was a helper and I honestly don't see him doing the fighting type
8683000	8686000	Unless maybe if he was on a second bard he fought in his underwear
8686000	8690000	I was just going to say when he gets down to low life his suit gets knocked off
8690000	8693000	Or he has the gold armor during a power up
8693000	8694000	I don't know I'm stupid
8694000	8696000	I want Forte
8696000	8698000	Or
8698000	8700000	Bass
8700000	8702000	Rob from Rockman
8702000	8704000	Um
8704000	8706000	I also
8706000	8710000	I'd actually like to see Ingrid
8710000	8713000	And I definitely want Sakura in the game
8713000	8715000	But um
8715000	8717000	I don't know
8717000	8719000	You could really there's just so much to choose from
8719000	8721000	Alright enough fanboy wank
8721000	8722000	That's it
8722000	8723000	Alright
8723000	8724000	Wank wank wank
8724000	8726000	Speaking of wank I'm sorry that was wang
8726000	8728000	Today
8728000	8729000	Oh and the Watchmen movie
8729000	8730000	Yeah I've heard I've heard
8730000	8732000	Big blue cock
8732000	8734000	I think it's all CGI though
8734000	8738000	Actually I will go ahead and tell everybody this who's going to see the movie
8738000	8742000	Unless you're like looking at his crotch
8742000	8744000	The cock is not distracting
8744000	8746000	Unless you're looking for it
8746000	8749000	Cock is always distracting I don't know dark Sakura
8749000	8752000	It glowed with the rest of him so it was kind of hard to see
8752000	8756000	Alright I'm waiting to see the movie on IMAX
8756000	8758000	So I can have you know a six story tall cock
8758000	8759000	That would be
8759000	8760000	Is that like Disneyland?
8760000	8762000	It's an IMAX at Eldorado Hills
8762000	8763000	Is it really?
8763000	8764000	I know they had IMAX out there
8764000	8766000	Yeah I know they just added it but um
8766000	8767000	Yeah it's playing there
8767000	8769000	Alright
8769000	8771000	The Irish gangster in chat says
8771000	8774000	In Soviet Russia cock looks at you
8774000	8776000	Do you want six story cock?
8776000	8777000	Uh sure
8777000	8779000	Do you want to be blue and radioactive?
8779000	8780000	Yes please
8780000	8781000	Okay
8781000	8783000	Alright let's
8783000	8787000	Let's get one more story and then we're going to open up the skype line to your calls
8787000	8790000	At 1-877-GAME-OLR
8790000	8791000	Yeah
8791000	8797000	So let's see there's some possible announcements that are going to happen
8797000	8800000	Later this week actually
8800000	8802000	Supposedly on March 12th
8802000	8807000	Kind of going along with their whole launch event for Resident Evil 5 in San Francisco
8807000	8814000	There is some evidence suggesting that they're going to announce a brand new Resident Evil title for the Wii
8814000	8820000	And that Resident Evil title just might be a port or remake of Resident Evil Code Veronica
8820000	8827000	And apparently there's been a lot of rumors going around saying you know
8827000	8833000	Hey if you're a Resident Evil Wii fan we've got some great news for you
8833000	8840000	And I don't know I mean honestly I didn't think Code Veronica was that great
8840000	8844000	From what I remember reading as far as reviews go and stuff
8844000	8851000	I don't know Code Veronica did come out though on the GameCube back in 2003
8851000	8857000	So maybe they're doing a Resident Evil 4 Wii version type thing for this
8857000	8860000	I don't know maybe just adding the Wii controls to it
8860000	8863000	I don't think that would be that exciting if that's what they're doing
8863000	8867000	But maybe a brand new Code Veronica game who knows
8867000	8869000	But maybe a brand new Resident Evil game for the Wii
8869000	8871000	Anything I guess is pretty good
8871000	8876000	AcidicVampire wonders aloud in our chat room why Veronica why not Resident Evil 2
8876000	8878000	I don't know
8878000	8884000	Maybe because you know not that many people had a Dreamcast
8884000	8888000	But compared to the Wii not that many people had a Dreamcast
8888000	8894000	And the Rob D in chat says the reviews for the Code Veronica were all pretty good on the Dreamcast
8894000	8901000	Alright hey if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
8901000	8904000	We are going to open up the phone lines right now to take your calls
8904000	8906000	Do we have any last minute stories while we're waiting?
8906000	8910000	I think we hit out almost everything that was in the show roll thread this week
8910000	8913000	But I don't know Loki did anything come up last minute tonight or Dark Soccer?
8913000	8916000	Cock
8916000	8919000	I waited for you to take a sip I timed it wrong
8919000	8920000	Yeah I had coffee
8920000	8924000	I ran in during that last story because I drank two cups of coffee so you know why I had to run in the house
8924000	8926000	Drop head to tinkle
8926000	8929000	Yes
8929000	8936000	I guess like a small thing I guess some of the cars from Burnout are going to be in Godfather 2
8936000	8937000	Interesting
8937000	8939000	That doesn't make any sense to me but okay
8939000	8940000	Alright we got a call on the line
8940000	8942000	Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this?
8942000	8944000	Breslau how you guys doing?
8944000	8947000	Breslau damn we haven't heard from you in the show in a long time
8947000	8950000	You know in chat you never shut up but it's nice to hear your actual voice how have you been?
8950000	8952000	I don't know what you're talking about
8952000	8954000	How have you been sir?
8954000	8961000	I have been well except for my Xbox Red Ringing which is the complete stem of that little rant I wrote on our news page
8961000	8968000	But before it Red Ringed a mini review of a game that's been out for a while
8968000	8971000	The Sega Sonic Genesis Mega Collection
8971000	8972000	Yes
8972000	8975000	I don't know if you guys have talked about this
8975000	8980000	We have we lavished fanboy wank upon it a few weeks ago that's my tip of the evening fanboy wank
8980000	8986000	It's probably the best bang for your buck on the Xbox right now it's almost 50 games for 30 bucks
8986000	8992000	And you can get a lot of play out of it you get two shining forces four fantasy stars all the Sonics
8992000	8996000	I mean there's at least 80 hours of gameplay in there
8996000	9005000	What I didn't really like is you can change the video settings but it's only within each game there's not a global setting
9005000	9007000	That gets kind of annoying
9007000	9015000	The games also just like everything else that's happened with you know old ports they don't look good in 720p
9015000	9020000	No they don't and you know what though I agree maybe a global setting would be nice
9020000	9023000	But you know the game does remember from game to game how you have it set
9023000	9028000	So some games look better like with that stretched you know faux 16x9 than others
9028000	9031000	Other games were not meant to be played in that stretched 16x9
9031000	9035000	But games like Sonic Spinball actually work really well in the stretched 16x9
9035000	9040000	Absolutely I agree with that I mean a lot of those Sonic games look good in 16x9
9040000	9044000	You know the smoothing feature is probably one of the worst things I've seen
9044000	9048000	But there's two games that actually look good with them and there's Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles
9048000	9052000	But overall it's 30 bucks go get it
9052000	9057000	Yeah it's not bad I actually reviewed it on Playstation 3 because when I went to get it they didn't have it on 360
9057000	9061000	So I just said what the hell it's the same game so I got it on Playstation 3 but you know same same
9061000	9063000	And it's a great collection
9063000	9071000	Yeah absolutely and if any of you haven't heard I have to plug the other thing I do besides the USO March Madness
9071000	9074000	Which the Final Four has been announced blah blah blah
9074000	9076000	You want to tell us what the Final Four is real quick?
9076000	9083000	Sure why not the Final Four as of right now are Super Mario Bros. 3 vs. Rock Band
9083000	9090000	And I know at least one person on the air right now voted Rock Band very protest like
9090000	9097000	Yes but that was me just because I wanted revenge on Tetris for it beating Super Metroid
9097000	9100000	But I still believe Rock Band has no business being in the top four games of all time
9100000	9104000	Mario 3 I can see that I can see that
9104000	9109000	Well that comes from you know this show's roots as a music game show
9109000	9114000	Sure I understand that I understand that it's not please I spent like most of my gaming week playing Rock Band
9114000	9121000	It's not that I dislike Rock Band by any means but it's no Mario 3 it's no Super Metroid
9121000	9123000	It's no Final Four game and it's no one seed
9123000	9127000	Maybe in a couple years it needs to age like a wine a little bit
9127000	9133000	Yeah and then the battle of the Super Nintendo games on the other side of the bracket is Chrono Trigger vs. Link to the Past
9133000	9138000	Link to the Past almost got beat by Sonic 2 which has been the dark horse of the entire tournament
9138000	9141000	Yeah it's been very interesting I don't know how Sonic 2 has been doing
9141000	9145000	Who are the Sonic fans that are voting that game up? Nobody's really professed
9145000	9148000	I did it a couple rounds but not against Link to the Past not against that
9148000	9150000	I didn't do it against Ocarina of Time
9150000	9154000	I still have a hard time accepting that Chrono Trigger beat Final Fantasy 6
9154000	9161000	But that's my own because I love Final Fantasy 6 but I understand there is so much fanboy wank
9161000	9165000	For lack of a better term out there for Chrono Trigger especially with the recent release
9165000	9170000	I can see that but I'm a little disappointed that Final Fantasy 6 didn't pull through
9170000	9176000	But I guess if it's going to be beat at least it didn't get beat by like DDR or something
9176000	9179000	If Final Fantasy 6 is going to get beaten by a game at least it was Chrono Trigger
9179000	9182000	At least I can say okay I understand that
9182000	9187000	Yeah and it's the same thing along Mario 3 beating DDR finally
9187000	9194000	But also if you haven't heard and you are in the Pacific Northwest area
9194000	9198000	The convention that I staff at Sakura Con is going to have Smile DK there
9198000	9201000	It's their second North American appearance ever
9201000	9207000	So it's in a month so I think preregistration closes next Sunday
9207000	9212000	And I think it's $45 for all three days so if you want to go and meet Smile DK
9212000	9217000	And also we're going to be doing under sedation live on location so
9217000	9219000	Is Travis going out there for that?
9219000	9225000	Travis is not but we have an internet connection and there's sure to be a lot of fun involved with that
9225000	9230000	You know what if the Southwest prices stay low I might just have to consider it
9230000	9233000	Because my friend can get me a really good discount on rooms and stuff
9233000	9236000	I might have to consider it press lol
9236000	9240000	Because especially if you can get us an interview with Smile DK I might really have to do it
9240000	9243000	Oh dude absolutely
9243000	9249000	Interesting I don't know I can't speak for the other two but I will always take an excuse to go to Seattle
9249000	9252000	Absolutely I took an excuse to move here
9252000	9256000	I don't know but at the same time I've also been promising Chicago for years and years
9256000	9260000	And I kind of feel like an obligation that if I'm going to do one I kind of need to make ASEN happen
9260000	9262000	But we'll see
9262000	9268000	Alrighty well that's it really from here in Seattle so nice hearing from you guys again
9268000	9272000	Alright thank you as well Bresl and keep writing those articles for the website
9272000	9274000	Good time
9274000	9276000	And by the way
9276000	9279000	He hung up on us little bastard
9279000	9285000	By the way speaking of articles on the website while we're waiting for another call
9285000	9289000	At 1877 Game OLR username on Skype Orange Launch Radio
9289000	9291000	I wanted to plug something on the website real quick
9291000	9294000	It's an article that was just posted and I thought this was actually a pretty good idea
9294000	9296000	Something that was posted by Dekeman
9296000	9299000	Kind of a different contest here for the best Konami games
9299000	9302000	Because you know Konami's 40th birthday is coming up in a couple weeks
9302000	9306000	We are going to actually do on OrangeLaunchRadio.com
9306000	9310000	The top three favorite Konami games is what you post
9310000	9314000	And then we're going to count down like the top five games in special highlight articles
9314000	9316000	That's kind of fun
9316000	9318000	So kind of counting down the top Konami games
9318000	9320000	Obviously we have a history with Konami here at this station
9320000	9325000	So I fully expect that BeatMania 2DX will be the number one
9325000	9327000	How can it not?
9327000	9331000	With our audience I would be shocked and odd if BeatMania 2DX is not number one
9331000	9333000	I'll tell you that wouldn't be my number one
9333000	9335000	I don't know
9335000	9337000	I'd have to sit down and think long and hard
9337000	9339000	I really have to look at like a big list of Konami games
9339000	9341000	I would put some obscure shit in there though
9341000	9343000	I would tell you that
9343000	9345000	You know what the top of my list would be Rob?
9345000	9347000	What's that?
9347000	9349000	Dracula X
9349000	9351000	Oh that is Castlevania
9351000	9353000	Now it's tough
9353000	9355000	You're on our website www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
9355000	9357000	Let's go back to the phones because it's been ringing
9357000	9359000	And I'm sorry guys if I haven't been picking up
9359000	9361000	But I wanted to get that out there
9361000	9363000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
9363000	9365000	Hey it's Ron what's up everyone?
9365000	9367000	Not much how you doing Rama?
9367000	9369000	Good I'm recovering from restoring windows on my computer
9369000	9371000	But other than that life's been pretty good
9371000	9373000	Yeah
9373000	9375000	Good good
9375000	9377000	What do we owe this phone call to tonight?
9377000	9379000	Some information that I happened to come across
9379000	9381000	I meant to discuss the last time I spoke to you guys
9381000	9383000	Now
9383000	9385000	As you know Sega was at
9385000	9387000	Comic Con back in February
9387000	9389000	It seems
9389000	9391000	That another video game
9391000	9393000	Company is looking into going
9393000	9395000	At the conventions as well
9395000	9397000	How so?
9397000	9399000	Well as you guys know
9399000	9401000	I work for a company where we go to cons
9401000	9403000	We set up booths and we sell items
9403000	9405000	Now we're doing
9405000	9407000	Anime Boston in May
9407000	9409000	And we just got information about
9409000	9411000	A couple of weeks ago
9411000	9413000	About two or three weeks ago
9413000	9415000	About our location and where we're going to be
9415000	9417000	It seems that our booth is going to be
9417000	9419000	You ready for this?
9419000	9421000	Directly across from Nintendo
9421000	9423000	Huh
9423000	9425000	Interesting
9425000	9427000	Wow okay
9427000	9429000	So Nintendo is going around the cons
9429000	9431000	What do you think they're going to be showing off?
9431000	9433000	Do you think it's just the Wii or what?
9433000	9435000	I really don't know
9435000	9437000	I'm thinking either
9437000	9439000	It's going to be like a booth version of
9439000	9441000	Nintendo World set up there
9441000	9443000	Or um
9443000	9445000	Actually Nintendo will be coming down with kiosks
9445000	9447000	With the displays that show off
9447000	9449000	A lot of games
9449000	9451000	Hmm
9451000	9453000	Considering the business that you're in
9453000	9455000	If it's what I think it is, if it's still the same
9455000	9457000	I think that's very funny that you're going to be directly across from Nintendo actually
9457000	9459000	Well
9459000	9461000	Because they kind of screwed us
9461000	9463000	Over at one convention
9463000	9465000	They gave us first dibs and when we picked it
9465000	9467000	We found out afterwards that Nintendo is directly
9467000	9469000	Across from us so
9469000	9471000	Everyone at the booth will be doing Nintendo themed
9471000	9473000	Cosplays
9473000	9475000	Ha ha, I see, okay
9475000	9477000	Trying to get some attention, very smart
9477000	9479000	Well we try
9479000	9481000	Very smart
9481000	9483000	Well I expect a full report and pictures
9483000	9485000	Because sadly Anime Boston, I don't think
9485000	9487000	Considering I've got two other cons
9487000	9489000	I'm trying to weigh between, I don't think Anime Boston is going to happen
9489000	9491000	However
9491000	9493000	However, PAX East Coast
9493000	9495000	You know I want to go to that
9495000	9497000	Well you best be there man
9497000	9499000	That will be my arrival in Boston
9499000	9501000	And I have internet friends in that area that I want to go visit anyway
9501000	9503000	So it works out
9503000	9505000	So we'll see
9505000	9507000	Well good luck with that
9507000	9509000	Any other conventions coming up that we ought to know about are our listeners
9509000	9511000	Well if you're in
9511000	9513000	New York, New Jersey, Tri-State area
9513000	9515000	Coming up we have
9515000	9517000	Castle Point Anime Convention, Hoboken, New Jersey
9517000	9519000	And ICON
9519000	9521000	29 I believe
9521000	9523000	One of East Coast's biggest
9523000	9525000	sci-fi conventions
9525000	9527000	It's sci-fi and medieval arts
9527000	9529000	Alright
9529000	9531000	Sci-fi and medieval arts
9531000	9533000	It reminds me of that whole
9533000	9535000	Margaret Cho joke about
9535000	9537000	Why is it that, you know, Star Trek
9537000	9539000	Always seems to go hand in hand with the Ren Faire
9539000	9541000	I don't know, sorry
9541000	9543000	Random thought
9543000	9545000	I don't know about you but Star Trek can go with
9545000	9547000	Almost anything, you know
9547000	9549000	It really can, it really can
9549000	9551000	I'm gonna get some more calls but thank you so much
9551000	9553000	Alright, later
9553000	9555000	There's a lot of you guys hammering the line tonight
9555000	9557000	I just don't want to try to get to as many calls as I can
9557000	9559000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9559000	9561000	DS Master 26
9561000	9563000	Hi DS Master 26, what's on your mind?
9563000	9565000	Much more game review
9565000	9567000	For ya, and uh
9567000	9569000	A few comments and suggestions for the show
9569000	9571000	Alrighty
9571000	9573000	Well, um
9573000	9575000	Cause I'm an F-Zero fan
9575000	9577000	I mean, who isn't in this house, you know
9577000	9579000	Love F-Zero, wish they would
9579000	9581000	Put a new one out on the Wii already, yeah
9581000	9583000	And just to fill the time
9583000	9585000	I'm waiting for a friggin' DS version
9585000	9587000	To come out, I have a PSP here
9587000	9589000	As you can tell, and so I'm like
9589000	9591000	You know, it's a lot better to fill it than wipe out
9591000	9593000	Pure, right?
9593000	9595000	So, I'm like
9595000	9597000	Okay
9597000	9599000	I storied up everything, I have
9599000	9601000	My friend Gamesafe who had all the classic
9601000	9603000	Packs and everything, cause I can't tell them
9603000	9605000	For some weirdo reason, they closed the site
9605000	9607000	To download stuff from
9607000	9609000	But uh, it's a little bit more challenging
9609000	9611000	Than F-Zero, I'll tell you that
9611000	9613000	It is, I've played the Wipeout
9613000	9615000	On uh, Playstation Network, I can't remember the
9615000	9617000	Name of it, I think it's just Wipeout HD
9617000	9619000	And uh, it's a little harder
9619000	9621000	Than F-Zero, it's such a different style
9621000	9623000	Too, F-Zero to me is a little more
9623000	9625000	Cartoony, but don't take that
9625000	9627000	Too literally, you know what I mean? Like
9627000	9629000	F-Zero GX especially, which is one of my favorite
9629000	9631000	Racing games ever, is not definitely
9631000	9633000	A cartoony looking game, but Wipeout feels a little
9633000	9635000	More, I don't know, just a little more
9635000	9637000	Edgy than F-Zero, but that doesn't
9637000	9639000	Usually that's a term that means
9639000	9641000	One's better than the other, not in this case
9641000	9643000	Yeah, and uh
9643000	9645000	I don't know, but like
9645000	9647000	It's so hard to get on your
9647000	9649000	Channel sometimes, uh
9649000	9651000	Have you guys ever thought of like, you know, doing
9651000	9653000	Open mic or conference call
9653000	9655000	With Skype?
9655000	9657000	Like AGI and DPL did?
9657000	9659000	What do you mean like
9659000	9661000	Just opening it up so that every
9661000	9663000	Person can come on and chat and stuff?
9663000	9665000	Perhaps
9665000	9667000	We like that, yeah
9667000	9669000	I think the only problem with that is that, you know
9669000	9671000	We try to cover a lot of ground during the show
9671000	9673000	And I think if we did that, we would
9673000	9675000	Just, it would just kind of turn into this giant
9675000	9677000	You know, cluster of a show
9677000	9679000	What I would love, I would love to take calls
9679000	9681000	Throughout the show, but we need like
9681000	9683000	Somebody to screen the calls in order to be able
9683000	9685000	To do that to make sure people are gonna stay on topic
9685000	9687000	Again, so the show can flow
9687000	9689000	One of the feedback I hear about the show very often is that
9689000	9691000	It's almost a little too long
9691000	9693000	So I would just be afraid that if we did kind of just
9693000	9695000	I mean, we got on enough tangents as it is
9695000	9697000	If we let it get on even more tangents
9697000	9699000	I'd just be afraid we'd be here for six hours
9699000	9701000	Which, you know, I do love this show
9701000	9703000	But, um
9703000	9705000	You know, I also love going to bed at a decent hour
9705000	9707000	So, but you know
9707000	9709000	That's why we do at least a Skype line, try to get the feedback
9709000	9711000	And I know not everybody can always get through
9711000	9713000	We try to do the emails and chat room comments
9713000	9715000	And we'd like to think, out of all the gaming
9715000	9717000	Podcasts out there, we're one of the
9717000	9719000	More interactive ones that are out there
9719000	9721000	But I know there's other shows doing their thing
9721000	9723000	But speaking of all games and all that stuff
9723000	9725000	You know, look forward to
9725000	9727000	At E3
9727000	9729000	More of that kind of working together type of stuff
9729000	9731000	That maybe you saw at Penny Arcade Expo
9731000	9733000	I don't have anything down in writing for sure yet
9733000	9735000	But you can definitely see that
9735000	9737000	There will be some joining of the independent
9737000	9739000	Podcast to do some stuff
9739000	9741000	Come E3 this year, I would say that is
9741000	9743000	Inevitable, and working
9743000	9745000	With the listeners for listener feedback
9745000	9747000	I mean, I would love to do
9747000	9749000	Like live E3 shows
9749000	9751000	Where the listeners can call in and ask us questions
9751000	9753000	And all that, but I don't know
9753000	9755000	If without the E3
9755000	9757000	What do they call that, E3 Arena this year
9757000	9759000	I don't know if that's going to be as possible
9759000	9761000	It's going to be interesting
9761000	9763000	SSG100, Matt
9763000	9765000	Go ahead
9765000	9767000	I also saw an episode of
9767000	9769000	Sessler's soapbox at Dollar Day
9769000	9771000	And actually, strange enough
9771000	9773000	I didn't get it from the
9773000	9775000	E3, E4 TV side of my PSP
9775000	9777000	Because, get this, they closed down
9777000	9779000	The RSS feeds for PSP users
9779000	9781000	Which kind of sucks
9781000	9783000	That's why I don't know if there's stuff on here before
9783000	9785000	But yeah, so I had to
9785000	9787000	Go off iTunes and everything
9787000	9789000	I had to convert, it's crud
9789000	9791000	But the topic
9791000	9793000	I'm sorry, I don't understand why
9793000	9795000	You'd want to close out one of your
9795000	9797000	Why would you want to shut the door on your listeners?
9797000	9799000	I mean, I guess when you're a TV station
9799000	9801000	And you have that type of money, you can make those types of decisions
9801000	9803000	But I just think it's crazy talk
9803000	9805000	To close the door
9805000	9807000	I mean, maybe it was costing them too much to produce
9807000	9809000	But how much can it cost
9809000	9811000	To translate a movie into PSP for
9811000	9813000	It seems a little silly, a little silly
9813000	9815000	Yeah, and
9815000	9817000	Sessler's soapbox was going on
9817000	9819000	About, you know, kids playing Emory games
9819000	9821000	And how, you know, it's no different
9821000	9823000	Than some kid possibly
9823000	9825000	You know, seeing a radar movie
9825000	9827000	I mean, heck, when I was
9827000	9829000	Eleven, I saw The Matrix
9829000	9831000	And I was, you know
9831000	9833000	Radar, did I end up
9833000	9835000	Going sniping people? No
9835000	9837000	Frickin' Chad Thompson
9837000	9839000	Who's
9839000	9841000	Well, thank God, disbarred
9841000	9843000	Um
9843000	9845000	Needs to get head screwed on straight
9845000	9847000	I know, you know,
9847000	9849000	Unfortunately, these guys
9849000	9851000	Run with the one bad apple
9851000	9853000	That ruins it for the rest of us normal people
9853000	9855000	You know what I mean?
9855000	9857000	Yeah, because of that, I mean, the only
9857000	9859000	Way I was able to get my hands on
9859000	9861000	GTA LCS
9861000	9863000	Was on Amazon with my debit card
9863000	9865000	Yes, I have one
9865000	9867000	I used to have a job
9867000	9869000	But now I'm dead broke with only
9869000	9871000	One dollar twenty cents on my account
9871000	9873000	Don't have enough to pay taxes, I am so screwed
9873000	9875000	Oh no
9875000	9877000	Starting to get a little depressing
9877000	9879000	Alright, well
9879000	9881000	Is there anything else you wanted to comment on
9881000	9883000	Before we try to get some more calls?
9883000	9885000	Um, yeah
9885000	9887000	You know, I kind of
9887000	9889000	Listened back to episode 3, 12 and what
9889000	9891000	Dan said, I went over to Game Shop
9891000	9893000	And whatever
9893000	9895000	Like, sorry, we still can't give you a
9895000	9897000	Replacement or whatever
9897000	9899000	And so
9899000	9901000	Basically, I don't know
9901000	9903000	What else to go at here
9903000	9905000	Other than spend twenty bucks
9905000	9907000	On a faceplate and whatever and replace
9907000	9909000	Next, I think that might be the issue
9909000	9911000	Yeah, it might be what you're gonna have to
9911000	9913000	Yeah, unfortunately it might be what you're gonna have to do at this
9913000	9915000	Point, I mean, I
9915000	9917000	No, no, I remember
9917000	9919000	Yeah, I think this was
9919000	9921000	The same one, but I remember the email a while back
9921000	9923000	That Dan was responding to
9923000	9925000	About the, yeah
9925000	9927000	And it was kind of no guarantee
9927000	9929000	That it was gonna work, so unfortunately
9929000	9931000	Yeah, you might just have to try and explore those
9931000	9933000	Options that are gonna cost a little bit of money
9933000	9935000	I know you say you don't have no money right now
9935000	9937000	But, you know, I guess there
9937000	9939000	Are some more things important than games
9939000	9941000	Prioritize
9941000	9943000	Yeah, because I spent
9943000	9945000	A bunch of money on my
9945000	9947000	Prom date with my girlfriend who also
9947000	9949000	Plays Destroy All Humans and says
9949000	9951000	That's better than GTA because she says
9951000	9953000	Flying saucers are better than
9953000	9955000	Pinks, but I don't know
9955000	9957000	What's your view on that?
9957000	9959000	Prioritize
9959000	9961000	Since I've been a prom date
9961000	9963000	Before, I wouldn't have wanted a whole lot of money
9963000	9965000	Spent on me if it was at the expense
9965000	9967000	Of someone being able to pay their bills
9967000	9969000	But, you know, it's all gonna be worth it
9969000	9971000	Because we're gonna be watching Twilight
9973000	9975000	Alright, well anyway, DS Master
9975000	9977000	We gotta let you go, we gotta get some more calls
9977000	9979000	Before we end up, but thank you so much for your call
9979000	9981000	And good luck with the monies
9981000	9983000	I know it's a tight time for a lot of people right now
9983000	9985000	But things will work out, they always do
9985000	9987000	Alright, good luck buddy
9987000	9989000	Peace out and keep rocking the show
9989000	9991000	Alright, we'll try, see ya
9991000	9993000	Alright, we'll probably take like one more call on the
9993000	9995000	Skypline of 1877 Game OLR
9995000	9997000	I wanted to read some comments
9997000	9999000	That were in chat
9999000	10001000	And now I can't find them, darn it
10001000	10003000	It was a little while ago
10003000	10005000	Oh, SSU100Matt says
10005000	10007000	OLR was the first show to use Skype
10007000	10009000	I still believe to this day that that is true
10009000	10011000	That we were, but
10011000	10013000	Nobody probably believes me, anyway, we got one more call
10013000	10015000	We'll take it, and then we're gonna wrap up the show
10015000	10017000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?
10017000	10019000	It's Death Wishing
10019000	10021000	Hi, Death Wishing, what's on your mind?
10021000	10023000	First, I'd like to say, no more cock jokes
10023000	10025000	Sure, you got a whole chat storm of cock jokes
10025000	10027000	And it was very, um
10027000	10029000	Alright
10029000	10031000	Unfortunately that happens sometimes
10031000	10033000	Is that one funny thing is said and the chat just won't let it die
10033000	10035000	But that's just part of the
10035000	10037000	It's a revival of the old big black cock
10037000	10039000	It's, it's, it's not a big black cock
10039000	10041000	It's charm?
10041000	10043000	I don't know?
10043000	10045000	Oh, I forget, what did you call in about tonight?
10045000	10047000	Um, I would like to comment on the guitar hero
10047000	10049000	You know, holy crap, there's a lot of them
10049000	10051000	For real, right?
10051000	10053000	I mean, did you hear earlier
10053000	10055000	When we were saying, can you hear the milking of the franchise?
10055000	10057000	I personally call it
10057000	10059000	You know the weird 30 year old guy
10059000	10061000	That stays in his mom's basement
10061000	10063000	And has an addiction to porn
10063000	10065000	It's pretty much, he's running out of Vaseline
10065000	10067000	You better watch it, because I've got two of those three
10067000	10069000	I'm 30 years old and addicted to porn
10069000	10071000	But do you live with your mom?
10071000	10073000	No, I don't, thankfully
10073000	10075000	Alright
10075000	10077000	Wait, so what about the guys that live with their mom?
10077000	10079000	These are the guys that are gonna be buying the games?
10079000	10081000	No, no, I'm just saying
10081000	10083000	That's like an example
10083000	10085000	That's an example of what they're doing to it
10085000	10087000	My problem is that the guitar hero games
10087000	10089000	Aren't exactly the same as like Rock Band
10089000	10091000	Whereas Rock Band, say for example
10091000	10093000	You know, someone was actually
10093000	10095000	Doing a comparison with the amount of games
10095000	10097000	That Rock Band releases, and to be honest
10097000	10099000	The games that they release, like the track packs
10099000	10101000	Or whatever, it's just download content
10101000	10103000	That's available now on disc
10103000	10105000	It's not something that you necessarily need to buy
10105000	10107000	It's nothing new, unless you don't have internet
10107000	10110000	But the guitar hero games
10110000	10113000	They're all these different new tracks
10113000	10115000	That you can't dump together
10115000	10117000	So you have to buy all these games
10117000	10119000	And each one has to be played separately
10119000	10121000	And that's retarded
10121000	10123000	And that's one thing I really like about Rock Band 2 as well
10123000	10125000	Is that it seems like the developers of Rock Band
10125000	10127000	Are continuing to add to Rock Band 2
10127000	10129000	Granted, yeah, you got the ACDC game
10129000	10131000	But they didn't really bother to promote that that much
10131000	10133000	It was just kind of a one-off thing
10133000	10135000	Like, hey, this is out there, you can get this
10135000	10138000	And then everything is pouring into Rock Band 2
10138000	10140000	They have all this regular content
10140000	10143000	And sure, okay, the Beatles game is going to be
10143000	10145000	A completely separate game
10145000	10147000	But it's the fucking Beatles, they're allowed
10147000	10149000	Well, that's the deal that they had
10149000	10151000	They would have done it as a Rock Band track pack
10151000	10153000	But the people that have the Beatles license
10153000	10155000	They're like, uh, no
10155000	10157000	Which, again, it's the Beatles, they're allowed
10157000	10159000	There's not a lot of bands I'd say that for
10161000	10163000	But with Guitar Hero, yeah, I mean, come on
10163000	10165000	The greatest hits
10165000	10167000	The sub-par 80s game
10167000	10169000	Pretty much, if you want greatest hits
10169000	10171000	Just pick up the
10171000	10173000	Dish, you'll probably be able to get it cheaper
10173000	10175000	Well, even the greatest hits isn't so bad
10175000	10177000	Because they're expanding on it
10177000	10179000	And that's fine, but
10179000	10181000	I don't know, it's just
10181000	10183000	It's all these games
10183000	10185000	And all these artist-specific games
10185000	10187000	To me, it sounds very risky
10187000	10189000	Because not everyone loves Metallica
10189000	10191000	Not everyone loves Van Halen
10191000	10193000	Not everyone loves Aerosmith
10193000	10195000	I mean, so
10195000	10197000	And the other thing, too, they're all
10197000	10199000	Well, you know, you get like 40-some tracks
10199000	10201000	For, you know, 60 bucks or whatever
10201000	10203000	That's a great deal
10203000	10205000	I might not want all those tracks
10205000	10207000	At least with Rock Band, I can pick and choose what I want
10207000	10209000	And that's why I love Rock Band
10209000	10211000	You know, yeah, from a gamer standpoint
10211000	10213000	Right now, I, you know
10213000	10215000	Somebody who's been playing music
10215000	10217000	Games for about 10 years now
10217000	10219000	I definitely prefer Rock Band to Guitar Hero
10219000	10221000	At this point in time
10221000	10223000	For these reasons that we've been stating
10223000	10225000	It's just
10225000	10227000	A better package to me
10227000	10229000	And plus, also, consider this
10229000	10231000	The Guitar Hero on tour, the DS one
10231000	10233000	Eh, you know, what are they trying to do with that?
10233000	10235000	DS one gives you carpal tunnel
10235000	10237000	Yeah, they're trying to condense
10237000	10239000	The guitar playing experience into the DS
10239000	10241000	Which just doesn't really work
10241000	10243000	And honestly, those DS games, they're about
10243000	10245000	As different with each other as, unfortunately
10245000	10247000	The guitar-free schemes in their arcades
10247000	10249000	Trackless update, trackless update
10249000	10251000	Let's reskin it a little bit, done
10251000	10253000	But, the Rock Band game that's coming out
10253000	10255000	For PSP, where they're kind of
10255000	10257000	Now taking this different approach to it
10257000	10259000	Where it's gonna be more like frequency or amplitude
10259000	10261000	If the rumors are to be believed
10261000	10263000	That sounds awesome!
10263000	10265000	No stupid peripheral to plug in my PSP
10265000	10267000	Just making music
10267000	10269000	And in a way
10269000	10271000	That's just different from
10271000	10273000	It sounds great
10273000	10275000	Dang moment
10275000	10277000	Here's a thought, this would be kind of cool
10277000	10279000	Can you imagine if they were to do
10279000	10281000	A game like that, for say the 360
10281000	10283000	Or whatever, and the PS3
10283000	10285000	Kind of like this amplitude Rock Band thing
10285000	10287000	But, it took all the music that you
10287000	10289000	Downloaded from Rock Band and allowed you to
10289000	10291000	Use that
10291000	10293000	Jizz in my pants
10293000	10295000	Isn't that pretty much audio surf?
10295000	10297000	It basically is, sort of
10297000	10299000	Audio surf is more of just a game that's a rhythm
10299000	10301000	Stuff, it doesn't add elements
10301000	10303000	To the music, you don't
10303000	10305000	Play the drum track and play something else
10305000	10307000	Yeah, audio surf also
10307000	10309000	Can kind of be a little hit and miss
10309000	10311000	If you play a song with a very strong beat
10311000	10313000	It'll be a lot better than just
10313000	10315000	It's just like those
10315000	10317000	DDR games, what was like the Codemasters
10317000	10319000	Game where you could play any CD
10319000	10321000	Dance Factory or whatever
10321000	10323000	A lot of songs in Dance Factory
10323000	10325000	I've not really heard of that
10325000	10327000	We know a lot of obscure shit here, but there was a
10327000	10329000	DDR knock off where you could put in your own CD
10329000	10331000	And get the arrows generated
10331000	10333000	And it was very hit and miss, mostly miss
10333000	10335000	Dude
10335000	10337000	Alright, well hey, any other
10337000	10339000	Final thoughts before we get on out of here?
10339000	10341000	I went to UCLA
10341000	10343000	And they have two street fighter cabinets
10343000	10345000	Four cabinets there
10345000	10347000	At UCLA, really?
10347000	10349000	Big scene there? Were they busy?
10349000	10351000	Well, I went there when it was lunch
10351000	10353000	Because I'm not that old, I'm only 16
10353000	10355000	I went on a field trip there
10355000	10357000	And there was like
10357000	10359000	It was lunch time, there was about
10359000	10361000	Maybe 10 people
10361000	10363000	In there, I guess at lunch, you know, some people
10363000	10365000	Could be in classes or something, but they also had
10365000	10367000	King of Fighters and Street Fighter 3
10367000	10369000	You know, and it was just like
10369000	10371000	They all
10371000	10373000	It was pretty much like the
10373000	10375000	All the Asian games you want to play
10375000	10377000	Since you're in the LA area, have you ever been to an arcade out there
10377000	10379000	Called Arcade Infinity?
10379000	10381000	No. It's out in City of
10381000	10383000	Industry, and actually we've
10383000	10385000	Back in the day when we were much more into the DDR
10385000	10387000	And Beatmania, we would drive all the way from Sacramento
10387000	10389000	Where we're based, to go to this arcade
10389000	10391000	To play some of the legendary games
10391000	10393000	There was the Gundam game
10393000	10395000	That was epic
10395000	10397000	There were just so many epic games
10397000	10399000	I haven't been there in a long time, but I imagine they've got
10399000	10401000	Quite a crowd of people, too, around these fighting games
10401000	10403000	So, you know, there's definitely an audience
10403000	10405000	For it, and it's
10405000	10407000	The only arcades I ever really went to were like
10407000	10409000	I think the Sega one I knew
10409000	10411000	Oh, Gameworks?
10411000	10413000	No, it was all Sega
10413000	10415000	But then it got turned into Gameworks, I think
10415000	10417000	Oh, because I knew that Gameworks was a Sega arcade
10417000	10419000	I think I know what he's talking about
10419000	10421000	I can't remember
10421000	10423000	I might have been there once, but anyway
10423000	10425000	It had this awesome helicopter game where you rolled around
10425000	10427000	The Sega 360
10427000	10429000	Was that the Tatsu?
10429000	10431000	Was that a Sega thing?
10431000	10433000	That's the Sega 360
10433000	10435000	It's a lot better than the Tatsu thing
10435000	10437000	Oh, okay. A little different
10437000	10439000	But arcades are pretty much dead now
10439000	10441000	And it's sad, because
10441000	10443000	All the online gaming
10443000	10445000	Has really put a dent in it
10445000	10447000	It's gonna take something epic to bring people back
10447000	10449000	But who knows? Maybe when the recession
10449000	10451000	I know a way to bring back arcades
10451000	10453000	Real quick, what is it?
10453000	10455000	Boobs
10455000	10457000	We'll see what happens
10457000	10459000	Alright, Deathwishing, we gotta let you go to wrap up this show
10459000	10461000	Good luck on your quest for boobs in arcades
10461000	10463000	Alright
10463000	10465000	I'll be a millionaire one day, just watch
10465000	10467000	Alright, you heard it here first
10467000	10469000	Alright, take care, buddy
10469000	10471000	Bye
10471000	10473000	I think everybody's thought about trying that
10473000	10475000	Like mixing a strip club with an arcade
10475000	10477000	With, I don't know, maybe there's local laws
10477000	10479000	I approve
10479000	10481000	No, I mean
10481000	10483000	That's just a strip club with an arcade in it
10483000	10485000	The problem is, though, is you really want
10485000	10487000	I mean, they don't want
10487000	10489000	Arcade games in a strip club
10489000	10491000	Because one, you have to pay money to get into a strip club
10491000	10493000	And two, it takes away from the time
10493000	10495000	That the strippers have with you, so they can't get paid
10495000	10497000	What if you got a lap dance
10497000	10499000	While playing, you know, Street Fighter IV
10499000	10501000	That'd be distracting
10501000	10503000	Yeah, it would be a little distracting
10503000	10505000	I tried
10505000	10507000	Alright, we're gonna take a minute to wrap up the show here
10507000	10509000	But a strip club with video game themes
10509000	10511000	That could be dual
10511000	10513000	Or video games and anime themes
10513000	10515000	That could be dual
10515000	10517000	Alright
10517000	10519000	That sounds like a bad convention
10519000	10521000	Like a cosplay strip club
10521000	10523000	But not with nasty looking chicks
10523000	10525000	It's not like when Consumer Electronics Show is going on
10525000	10527000	At the same time as the adult video convention
10527000	10529000	That kind of thing
10529000	10531000	Remember they just need to combine them into one
10531000	10533000	Alright, we gotta wrap up the show
10533000	10535000	Enough silly talk, we need to wrap up the show
10535000	10537000	We're running a little long tonight, which is fine
10537000	10539000	We've had a good show, a lot of good discussion tonight
10539000	10541000	And yeah, it was a good show, good calls, good discussion
10541000	10543000	Good chat, I'm feeling good about tonight's show
10543000	10545000	So thank you all for making it a success
10545000	10547000	Let's get some, I don't think there's any more
10547000	10549000	Last minute stories, right Loki?
10549000	10551000	Yeah, there's some Guitar Hero stuff
10551000	10553000	Coming out this month, including Queen
10553000	10555000	No, well, download tracks
10555000	10557000	Including Queen
10557000	10559000	Oh, well, that is epic
10559000	10561000	I will promise a story for Queen
10561000	10563000	Yeah, so there's some interesting songs
10563000	10565000	Including, I'm trying to think what they were now
10565000	10567000	As I pull this up
10567000	10569000	I think Killer Queen was one of them
10569000	10571000	Which is interesting
10571000	10573000	And then
10573000	10575000	Let's see here
10575000	10577000	It was nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody
10577000	10579000	Or anything cool like that, unfortunately
10579000	10581000	Um
10581000	10583000	Sorry
10583000	10585000	Let me just pull this up here
10585000	10587000	Killer Queen
10587000	10589000	That's interesting, because there was a cover
10589000	10591000	Of that in Guitar Freaks back in the day
10591000	10593000	Maybe that was the only
10593000	10595000	Um
10595000	10597000	Maybe that was the only Queen song
10597000	10599000	From the download content
10599000	10601000	I think there was only one or two, wasn't Bicycle in it?
10601000	10603000	I don't remember, Fat Bottom Girls or something
10603000	10605000	I don't know, they need them all
10605000	10607000	This is interesting, because Queen's
10607000	10609000	Supposed to be in SingStar too
10609000	10611000	They had
10611000	10613000	Yeah, Killer Queen
10613000	10615000	Which is going to be part of
10615000	10617000	The Queen Track Pack
10617000	10619000	We Are the Champions
10619000	10621000	Actually, no, Killer Queen isn't in that
10621000	10623000	It's We Are the Champions, Fat Bottom Girls
10623000	10625000	And Celebrity
10625000	10627000	And those are all going to be available in the Queen Track Pack
10627000	10629000	On March 26th
10629000	10631000	The week before that, they're going to have the Jimi Hendrix
10631000	10633000	Track Pack with Freedom, Angel, and
10633000	10635000	Foxy Lady, the live version
10635000	10637000	Nice, on March 19th
10637000	10639000	Also available on March 19th would be the European
10639000	10641000	Track Pack
10641000	10643000	I'm not sure if these were available in Europe
10643000	10645000	I'm sure it might be just European bands
10645000	10647000	With What Have You Done
10647000	10649000	By Within Temptation
10649000	10651000	I Are Comet Alex
10651000	10653000	By Dai Toten Hosen
10653000	10655000	And Carolina
10655000	10657000	By MClan
10657000	10659000	And then finally, available last week
10659000	10661000	Break It Out by Vanilla Sky
10661000	10663000	In the Shadows by
10663000	10665000	Rasmus
10665000	10667000	And Cies Komesa
10667000	10669000	By Lesrita
10669000	10671000	Mitsuko
10671000	10673000	I don't know, I think I butchered that last name
10673000	10675000	Mitsuko
10675000	10677000	Yeah
10677000	10679000	Alright
10679000	10681000	Ok, we gotta wrap up, we're gonna get all the closing
10681000	10683000	thoughts and wrap on out of here for tonight
10683000	10685000	We are running a little long tonight
10685000	10687000	Show's very, very long, but that's alright, it was a good show
10687000	10689000	Dark Sakura, your final thought for us tonight
10689000	10691000	Happy birthday, Chris
10691000	10693000	I agree, happy birthday, Chris
10693000	10695000	How dare I not say anything, I left her message on Facebook
10695000	10697000	earlier, but you know, just got sidetracked with the show
10697000	10699000	Yes, happy birthday
10699000	10701000	Chris, one of the OLR lesbians
10701000	10703000	My final thought
10703000	10705000	would be, I
10705000	10707000	am craving
10707000	10709000	Pringles
10709000	10711000	And no, this isn't a G4 show
10711000	10713000	back in the day, we're all sponsored by Pringles
10713000	10715000	but I really am craving Pringles, Loki, your final thought
10715000	10717000	I am not craving
10717000	10719000	Pringles, Pringles are nasty
10719000	10721000	Pringles are not nasty, you're nasty
10721000	10723000	Alright, we're done, we're out of here
