And are our boy in this blob set to make a comeback?
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that podcast, radio show dedicated to video games
Video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
My name is Rob Roberts joining you every week
Here on All Games Radio
6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time Live
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
And joining me as always say hello to the one and only
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
Yo
How you doing DarkSakura?
Mmm, interesting
Yeah, interesting?
Interesting
Okay, I get interesting good or interesting bad
Because interesting is a very, uh, interesting term
Interesting neutral
Okay, fair enough
Suddenly I feel like we're talking about D&D alignments or something
You're chaotic interesting
It's funny, I took a D&D alignment test
And I had taken the same one before
Right
And I came out chaotic good before
Last time I came out true neutral
But, you know, feelings change
How long ago was it that you took the test?
About a couple years ago
People change, you know
People sometimes shift their political ideals
Over years and years, you know
People change
We change our opinions on games
I remember a time on this show
We've been doing this show a long time
About seven years, right?
And I remember a time on this show where it was like
Xbox was the butt of all our jokes we ever made on this show
Like the ginormous controllers of the original Xbox
And now Xbox is pretty cool
I think all of us can agree
360's got a lot of great stuff on it
So it's just interesting
Right, Tech Master Loki?
And it's also not the size of a house
That's right
How you doing, Tech Master Loki?
Fine
Yeah?
Yeah
You have a good week?
Yeah, it was a pretty good week
I understand you finally got to Airsoft today
Yes, finally
How was that?
It was fun
I don't know, we played like three games
We played at a different place than normal
Because I didn't want to drive an hour to where we normally play
So we played at a field next to my work
And it was pretty nice
And there's lots of rocks
Because people might not know
But Folsom used to be a big mining town
And, well, they used to dredge and stuff in the river
And there are piles and piles of cobblestones
All over the place out there
And that's all the ground is, is cobblestones
Thankfully there was some dirt on there
So it wasn't so bad
But there's cobblestone hills that we were on top of
And there's a bunch of eucalyptus trees that they planted there for some reason
So it's like a big jungle out there
First person shooters for real, right?
Yep
I got to try out one of my new guns
And it's so awesome
My other guns, my older ones, not so awesome
And of course there's always you guys who join us here every week
On Orange Lounge Radio when we tape live
And you can join us in our chatroom live chat.orangeloungeradio.com
Or on the Game Surge Network for you IRC fans
At channel Orange Lounge
And the first comment tonight from Shadowrunner
Xbox is awesome until the Red Ring of Death and then it's fail
Good point
You know, the Xbox has taken a lot of crap for the Red Ring
And sure, Microsoft's, you know, kind of done the whole
Oops, our bad, we're going to extend the warranties and all that on that
But it makes me think of an article, if I can work in a cheap plug here
For the new orangeloungeradio.com website
Which has actually been, you know, thanks to our new writing staff
Has had a pretty constant stream of new articles
I got to say it's pretty awesome
One of them was written by Bresloll earlier this week
And he was kind of talking about, is it just me
Or are these new console systems just not built to last
Like the old ones
Like he was kind of saying, you know, I could probably still find a Nintendo that works
Or a Super Nintendo that works
And come to think of it, you know, I was kind of reading the article
And, you know, yeah, I don't think I ever, ever had a console break
Until the Xbox 360
But then there's also another argument that says, well look
Consoles broke all the time, you just didn't hear about it
Because now the internet culture, you know, one person's console breaks
In a, you know, over the top way
And it hits every game blog on the internet
And, you know, millions of people read about it
Kind of different interesting schools of thought
But, I don't know, you know, old school 8-bit NESs might still work
But you still have to blow on the cartridge
And blow in the system to get it to work, you know
Unless you're lucky enough to have a top loader
Well, with the 360, it's basically praying that it's not gonna break
Because, you know, it's like if you look at it funny, it's like
I'm gonna die now
I hope you're happy
I know, you just kind of hope that it's gonna last, you know, the full three years
Well, it's just like the 360 that I fixed that's modded
I'm just surprised each day that it works
Because it's like, there's no reason that this should work, but it is
Every day is a new gift
Yes, exactly
GS68 in chat says, hey, some of my Super Nintendo games don't work anymore
Here's what I'm curious about
Does those batteries, remember how batteries were only supposed to last like five years
The batteries that they have in like the Zelda games or the battery backup
Did anybody ever read the fine print that those things were only supposed to last five years
I wonder, do some of those still work
I've never heard of those batteries really failing
My Zelda cartridge finally died
Did it really?
It did
Also, the same batteries, the lithium batteries are used in the Sega Saturn
Mine have had to be replaced a couple times
Wow
BlackWolf, plugging his other show in chat
We learned on Friday Night Gaming that blowing on the cartridge actually does nothing
It was the readjusting into the cartridge slot that fixed it
See, I always thought it was the moisture that you, when you were blowing on the cartridge
It was the moisture from your breath that was helping with the contacts
That's what I always thought was the
The moisture would corrode contact
Oh, interesting
We used to just take alcohol swabs
It all depends on how, what condition your console is in
You know, in your games
If you leave your games out and they're super dusty
Then blowing in it, I can imagine, would fix that a little bit
But yeah, usually it was the contacts on the inside that were really dirty
And thankfully they did have the NES cleaning kit
And you could, you know, do that and then you see the contacts and they come out all black and you're like, wow
One more comment from chat and then we'll get to how was your gaming week
We have Say in chat says, I've only ever had my PS1 break caught on fire
I can't, I would freak the hell out if that ever happened when a gaming system
Can you imagine a gaming system like catching fire?
Dude, what did you do with that system?
Was it like a 48 hour Final Fantasy 7 marathon or something?
Like how does your system catch fire?
Or maybe it wasn't properly vented, I don't know
But, you know, because some of those systems
Or he poured gasoline on it and set it on fire
I don't think that would be a, you know, whoops mistake
I don't know
Alright, let's, breaking these consoles in all these intricate ways makes me think back
Do you guys remember the SmashMyWee.com or whatever it was
I could be mistaken
Where they stood in line all night long to buy a Wii
Only so they could break it
Yeah, they'd be there all the time
The novelty is worn off
What a bunch of assholes, yeah the novelty is worn off
Now what they should do though
And I totally approve of this
Is like smash my scion or something
Something more expensive that it takes a while to smash this
You know, like you can actually do some serious damage to it
Because, you know, and what they do is get people to donate money so that they can go smash it
Why are we allowing these people to have the fun of smashing something
You know, I want to be able to smash something for free
Wow, and Sage just followed up in chat, it was some 24 hour thing
So, there you go
Alright, let's get to how was your gaming week
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week, what kind of games did you play this week
I played Ragnarok online and that's about it
Getting back into the Ragnarok, huh
Off and on, I've really been spending a lot more time doing, reorganizing our video game collection at my house
Which is actually what my husband is doing right now
We have a lot of games, a lot of games
Didn't you upload some of the pictures to our picture feed, I thought
Just one of the stacks, and that's like a small part of the vault
We've actually moved out a lot of our boxes into the garage and are going through everything
And Dan found all of our Guilty Gear figures today
And a few Mega Drive cartridges and stuff
Awesome
I found our copy of Policenauts
Wow, that's random
Hey, I got a question, I haven't asked this in a while, what ever happened with Ragnarok 2, I haven't heard anything on that in a while
Did that ever like release
I don't care
You weren't a fan
Still in beta, I don't care
After all this time, it's been like beta for like two years
How long was the first Ragnarok in beta
I guess that's true
You played with me in the beta
I remember, yeah, it was a long time ago
With your mage with a bow
Deathwishing in chat at chat.org.com says Ragnarok is way too confusing
What do you think this guy is doing wrong
Maybe he didn't translate the game yet, I don't know
Is it confusing, is it hard to get into
Is it about Ragnarok 2 or the first one
No, the first one
The first one is not at all confusing
It's really easy
I mean, it's just a matter of using common sense and combining your skills and what matches what you want to do
If you want to be a fighter, you can either go strong, tough, or fast
But it's also a different kind of game, right
Because if you go to this game after playing something like, I don't know, Warcraft, it's different
It's easier
Ragnarok Online is infinitely easier than World of Warcraft
But the thing that I think that people don't like about it is that you don't have someone holding your hand and allocating your points for you
Maybe it's because they expect you to fucking use your brain to allocate your points
You know
Alright
Am I right or am I right?
It's been so long since I've played, I honestly can't tell you
I don't even remember how the damn game works
I remember the porings were really cute, that's what I remember
World of Warcraft
Well, I wouldn't say it necessarily hand holds you and how to distribute your point
But here's the thing, Warcraft is so infinitely popular
You can go onto websites upon websites to tell you how to build your character
And then you get these, you know, elitist raiders that if you don't shape your character a certain way, then you are suck
But in the end, it's all basically your armor
Or the stuff you've got on you that controls it
In Ragnarok, it's if you kill creature, creature, creature
You can go put all of it in your intelligence and have a mage, you know
Intelligence and dex
If you want, like say if you're playing an assassin
You put it all in your agility, a little bit in strength and a lot of it in dex
And boom, you can hit and hit a lot
So, you know, and on top of that, your armor and your accessories are all in addition to what you do
So it's not really that confusing, you just have to know what you want
Blackwolf in chat, if I wanted to use my brain, I wouldn't rot them away playing a video game
He says with a little hint of sarcasm
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
I played loss and damage
And that's it
Just multiplayer, I didn't get around to doing much of anything
I'm trying to figure out why that was
Oh yeah, I remember now
Because I was trying to hack the loss and damage and it's fucking hard
So, yeah
So no luck there
Because apparently they have these SHA-1 hashes in a file
And if you change one byte of the file, it changes the whole hash
So you have to figure out where they need to be updated and for what blocks
It's so complicated that it just fries my brain thinking about it
But I want to do it because you can edit it just like the PC
Because it has the same format and stuff, so that'll be fun
But yeah, that's pretty much that
And then I did find my DS Lite finally
Buried amongst the stuff that was on my coffee table
And so I kind of went through there and I'm going to be playing some games on that now
So, hopefully I'll have a little bit more to play
And I know next week for sure I'm going to have some stuff to play
I'm getting from work a Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Killzone 2
Not that I'm really excited about it because I don't give a shit about Resident Evil
But I'll play it anyways or whatever
Killzone 2 looks interesting, I wasn't going to buy it though
So thank god I don't have to pay for it
But Mad World, holy shit, I can't wait to play that game
So that'll be one I'll be playing next week
But lots of fun stuff coming up
My gaming week, I didn't have time to play a whole lot
I did check out Quake Live for a brief little bit
Now that the queues apparently aren't such an issue
The first couple of days you try to get in there
You had these queues that were thousands of people long
It's just like, yeah right, you're not going to get in there
But finally I snuck in there one night and got to play
Because I think they finally eliminated the queues
Or really opened up the servers or something
Or the fever just died down, so it's really easy to get in there now
So I did play for a little bit
I was surprised because I don't know why
But I was under the impression that Quake Live was a new version of the original Quake
It's not, it's based off Quake 3
Even the same voice and all that stuff
So I was pleasantly surprised
I like how it does that skill match in the beginning
In the very beginning when you sign onto Quake Live
You have to play a 10 minute match against a computer opponent
That gets a little harder as you start kicking her butt
And then it gets a little easier if she starts killing you a lot
So it's supposed to skill match you with other opponents
So considering the whole thing is free
It's definitely worth checking out
If I suck really bad on that then I could play really hardcore against noobs
I would think so, but I would think that as you do that
Your skill rating is going to go up
So you don't get to do that for very long
I would imagine there's people
So I actually tried
Because I was thinking, oh I should just suck at this
So I can just get matched against really easy players
So I can feel better about myself
But then I thought no, because there's going to be a lot of other people thinking that same thing
So I'm going to just actually try
Because I know I'm not that great at Quake
And it was an even match between me and the computer opponent
So it was just kind of fun
And some comments from chat
Tigerclaw says, Quake Live also works in full screen
And that's true, Quake Live does run pretty well in full screen
Tigerclaw says, it's Quake 3 minus the blood and gore
Yeah, the blood's missing and all that stuff
But again, it's all free in the browser
It's very hard to complain
I had a good time with Quake Live
The little time I spent with it
I want to go back and revisit it
I also played some Rock Band 2
Because I love me some Rock Band
I spend an obscene amount of money on new songs
I don't know why I waste my money like that, but I do
I was like, oh, I have to play No Doubt and New
And I really want to play White Zombie
I have two drum sets and I use neither of them
Oh my gosh
Maybe I should borrow one
I need to get my drum achievements
I don't know
I've got one, it's the wireless one with the cymbals
I have the cymbals for it
Really?
Yeah, and they're kind of, eh
I might have to
And I have a drum bag, or a bag to carry the drums
I was thinking about getting that little portable one
I don't know how well they work
Don't get that
Is it terrible?
It looks like crap
Well, I don't know, but I like the idea that it doesn't take up all this freaking space in my house
You know, you kind of just put it out on the table and play
Seriously, if you got a bag for the drums
The one that they actually make for it
It doesn't take up that much space at all
It's like a small suitcase
And you can just put it down somewhere
I have my one set broken down in that
And then I have my other one that if I were to play Rock Band
I would use that set, but
They're both at work
So I don't, you know, because I've run out of space in my house
And here's the other thing
Also in my gaming week
I downloaded the demo for The Last Remnant
But I haven't checked it out yet, so
I don't know why I mentioned it
But I'm going to check that out this next week
Because I'm curious
If it's really, really good, I might just get it on 360
But I'm also kind of curious how it's going to run on PC
And then also
I wanted to go back and play Civilization 4
Because, you know, after video games live and everything
And seeing the little slideshow
I was like, oh, I need to get back into Civilization and play this game again
So I remembered it was on GameTap
So I went to GameTap and found it in their library
And tried to launch Civilization 4
It doesn't work
Because it doesn't work in Windows Vista
And come to find out, quite a few of their games don't work in Windows Vista
Also come to find out, GameTap's going through some major changes
In the next couple weeks
As they kind of shift to their new ownership or whatever
Whatever, I got this email about new pricing arrangements or whatever
And, you know, I'm locked into their current ones
So I'm not going to get shifted or whatever
But I don't know if I really like the direction GameTap's heading
I have to be honest
You know, as a fair critic
I don't know if I necessarily like
And I can't really judge until it happens
But now they have this whole thing where the arcade games
Are going to actually be playable in the browser window
And, you know, some of the classic games
And now some of the other stuff
Like, they're kind of turning into this hybrid of Steam
And, like, what sounds to me like Pogo games
And, like, I don't want to pay for Pogo games
You know what I mean?
So, I don't know
I'm going to withhold my full judgement
Until it comes out
But, I don't know, I'm just not happy either
That, like, some of these things just won't work in Vista
And I understand the games are old
They were made for a certain Windows system
It's my fault for being stupid and having Vista
But, look, that's what my computer came with
So that's all I have
I keep seeing advertisements for good old gaming
It's a, I don't know if it's a website
It's like Steam or something
But they have, you know, older games in there advertising
Rise of the Triad on there and stuff
So I think that's kind of neat
That they have the old games
If they would run or not
Because I know Duke Nukem 3D, for example
Won't run on, you know, XP
Unless you've got, you know, something special for it
So, I don't know
Dr. Tetsuya in chat says
I agree, we haven't used it in a long time
Especially since they're all about PC ports nowadays
Now, you know, call me stupid if you want
I don't care
I made an impulse buy a few months ago
Not that you've ever made impulse buys, Loki
I bought a full year of GameTap up front
So I'm locked into this thing for a year
Whether I like it or not
So, at least, you know, I'll have a chance to give it a full review
And maybe it'll win me over
I just don't like what I'm hearing, that's all
So, you know, I kind of look at these changes
And I go, oh boy, alright, I'm going to have to see this in motion
But, you know, I guess in the end it is all about the games
And if they can make it so that Civ 4 will magically work in Windows Vista
I don't know what they have to do
I imagine if they emulate all these old games, there's got to be a way to do it
Civ 4 is not, like, an obscure game
Couldn't you run it, like, say in the compatibility mode with XP or something like that?
Run GameTap?
Possibly, I haven't looked into how it works
Oh, I finally got to
Maybe there's a listener that's thinking, Rob, you're so stupid
There is totally a way you get it to work in Windows Vista
But then again, shouldn't GameTap just kind of be able to tell me that?
How about compatibility mode?
I just said that
Yeah, I don't know
Well, I finally got to use Vista
Yeah, I had my wife's co-worker want me to find her some stuff to put onto her system
You know, all legit software, of course
So, I hate Vista. It sucks really bad
It's just, the hand-holding stuff really pisses me off
I disagree
I don't know, I'm iffy on it
These compatibility type issues make me a little irked with Vista
I think I'm more looking forward to the new Windows than I am
I'm kind of like, uh, Vista's a stepping stone for me
I don't like Vista now
My system is completely tailored around running it
So, that's just how it was when I bought it
So, it runs like a dream on my computer
Yeah, it's fast
I mean, on my computer, it's well optimized and everything
But it's just, I don't know
I disabled all the touchscreen stuff because it was fucking with my tablet
And I disabled a few things here and there
But then again, I've always tweaked XP to get it to run how I want it to
I tweak every OS I get my hands on to make it run the way I want it to
And guess what? Right now, my Vista runs like XP with a few goodies
But I bet you wouldn't be able to play Civ IV either
Actually, I probably would be able to
If you can get it to work, let me know
City of Heroes gave me compatibility issues and I just changed it to run in compatibility mode
And boom, no problem
I'll check it out, maybe it is something that simple and I'm just being stupid
All it did was change my resolution
That's certainly a possibility
And then it changes it back when it's done
Alright, we'll see
I'll try it, I'll try it
I'll try to dig into compatibility mode
And then I'll get all those emails this week, you idiot, it was super easy
And then GameTap will email me, you idiot, stop talking negative about our service and you can't figure it out
But at the same time, I would think
If GameTap is going to give me an error message about not being able to start the game
It should tell me, hey, you should think about running in compatibility mode
Of course it could have been right in front of my face and I was just too pissed off not to see it
Anyhow
Alright, let's get into
Yeah, next link in chat says I have Civ IV and I run it off Vista
So I don't know
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, we'll see
I can fully admit, look, I'm not the biggest computer genius in the world
I can just get Civ IV, you know, so that you could play it without GameTap
Maybe that's what I'll be forced to do
Because I will feel that sense of entitlement
That's right
Not stealing
GameTap forced you
They forced you into this, okay
Alright
Let's move on with the show
We have some housekeeping to get into
And then we're going to get into tonight's show
Hey, I'm over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com right now live tonight during the show
Orange Lounge Radio March Madness The Elite 8 is wrapping up right now
And check that out
You can vote
There's some pretty epic matchups going on in the top 8 right now
Final Fantasy VI vs Chrono Trigger
Before the show tonight, Chrono Trigger was leading
But, you know, a lot can change
That's a pretty epic matchup
So you can go vote in that
And the Final Four will be announced a little later tonight after the show
And keep an eye on OrangeLoungeRadio.com for that throughout the week
Also, we have some more people writing on OrangeLoungeRadio.com
And now we have some new segments that showed up out of the blue that I'm loving
I heart that song
They've actually kind of been, I guess, using the classic game of the week a little bit as an inspiration
Some of our staff writers have been writing these tributes to great songs in gaming
Which has been kind of cool
And, you know, just some other great segments on OrangeLoungeRadio.com
Very happy with the direction the new site's going
Alright, I guess that's it for housekeeping
Don't forget, you know, LiveJournal, Facebook, MySpace, all that good stuff
Let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki
Well, there's interesting stuff coming out from Microsoft
You may remember last year during August that they did the, what was it, Summer of Arcade
It was a promotion where they had a bunch of really cool arcade games coming out back to back
You know, each week there'd be a really highly anticipated Xbox Live Arcade game
Well, I don't know if this is exactly the same type of thing
But they're doing one that's going to start on March 18th
It's the Days of Arcade promotion
I don't know why they couldn't have done Spring of Arcade
But Days of Arcade
And similar to the event that happened last year
They're going to have a bunch of different games coming out
Starting with the release of Hasbro Family Game Night
And if I remember correctly, I think Hasbro Family Game Night is actually like five different games
Yeah, it is. It's like Sari and a bunch of the old classic games
So I don't know if on the 18th they're going to get like five games all of a sudden
But whatever
Also coming out will be the Dishwasher Dead Samurai
Which, if you remember, was that really kickass XNA game
Finally now an actual game
Flock, which was Capcom's kind of sheep herding type of game
Outrun Online Arcade, which is pretty awesome
Puzzle Quest Galact...
Like Old School Sega Outrun?
Yes, like Outrun
Could be fun
Puzzle Quest Galactrix
Uno Rush
And Lode Runner
Those all sound pretty awesome, actually
You know, I don't know though, I don't get the same thrill out of Hasbro Family Game Night
That I did out of like Geometry Wars 2
And some of the things that came out in the summer
But I understand
Xbox has a family friendly niche they need to fill pretty badly to compete with Nintendo
So I'm okay with it, I understand why they need stuff like that
It all depends on what games
I can't remember what they had in the Hasbro Family Game Night
If they actually had, you know...
Battleship might be fun
Well also look, what's like the number one Xbox Live Arcade game
After all this time, like Uno
Maybe not number one, I have nothing to back that up
But it's still like in the top five at least
After all this time, Uno is still there
You know, tons of people still play Uno
So you can't say that there's not a demand for something like this
Especially if it's well done, so you know
And the Hasbro Family Game Night sells really well in every other system that it's out on
So I can see that
Yeah, I can see it too
There's a lot of love being lavished upon Galaga Legion in our chat room
Son of Dad says Galaga Legion was the best last year
Sonic M88, I loved Galaga Legion
That was a pretty good release in the last batch too
No I didn't actually... I think I downloaded that
I'm not sure if I bought it or not, but
I downloaded it and played the demo, it was pretty cool
But that was like right around the same time that I also got Space Invaders Extreme on my PSP
And I just kind of ended up playing that instead
Yeah
I think didn't Duke Nukem 3D come out during that time too?
I think it did
Yeah, I think that was one of the big releases too
Yeah, that was another one like Doom where I was like
Oh my god, it's Doom!
And it played multiplayer online like once
And I was like, okay I'm going on to other things now
But aren't they making a Galaga Legion 2?
Didn't we have a story on the show a few weeks ago about that?
That they're doing a second one?
I don't know about that
Some type of other reiteration of Galaga?
I don't know
It would be pretty awesome if they did
Hey, the Xbox Elite is being phased out apparently
This is the rumor going around the internet this week
Apparently the Xbox 360 is going to be more of like a limited edition type of console
It's not going to be so readily available
It's because retailers are not as happy about the Elite apparently
You know, the economy the way it is
A system that costs what, $200 more than the entry level system
It's not doing too well
So apparently Microsoft might actually be limiting the console sales
To only select retailers across North America and Europe
Apparently the Elite might just phase out altogether in Quarter 2
Yeah, I don't know about that
I mean, at least as far as when I'm selling it
We have tons of it on hand
So it won't be going away anytime soon
But I know they do
And some thought is that maybe they're phasing this out in favor of
The Elites will be out for the Resident Evil 5 Red Box Elite system
And then when that phases away and the next big Xbox game comes out
There'll be a limited edition system for that
They could be treating it like Sony's doing with their higher end systems
Like the 160GB system now that's bundled with the game
They may be doing that
And I can see, because right now the Elite by itself doesn't seem like a great deal
But when you have the Resident Evil Elite there
You get an arcade game and you also get a game with it for the same price
So that seems a little bit better of a deal to me
And yeah, I can totally see them doing a Halo ODST game
And bundle and I don't know what other games they have coming out in the pipeline here
I know this is such a cliche bitch about the Xbox 360
But how about a quiet edition console?
I might pay an extra $100 for a freaking quiet Xbox 360
I mean, especially compared to the Playstation 3
Which, you know, obviously it has its own shortcomings
But one thing, it's freaking quiet
That's why you install games to your hard drive
Even when you do that, you still hear the vroom
You don't hear the drive spin up
But the machine itself is incredibly loud
Well, it's either that or it red rings on you because it overheats
Would you rather it be loud or would you rather it be dead?
I would rather they just fix the problem and redo the console or whatever
You know, Sony does it with the PS2 and the PS1
You can hack in there and manually change the voltage of your fan
I shouldn't have to hack
They should just do it
And then it'll be nice and cook food on it and stuff
I don't know
Open the case on it and take the fans out, I don't know
I don't want to break the damn thing
I just want it to shut the hell up sometimes
Because it's kind of loud
They should make a fan case that would go over the loudest parts
Or something, or a noise filter, I don't know
Maybe you should find some sort of noise trapping material
Like some sort of...
Like how metal would reflect a rubber mat or something
To put underneath it
Or maybe finding a different type of...
Some cabinets that you can put your systems in
Actually can put a glass window in front of it
With just the little thing for the cords and that kind of filters out the sound
I don't know
Or you get the integrated audio video setup
Where it's actually a plug in your wall
And you put another one in another room
And then you put your system in the other room
Since the wireless controllers can reach within 30 feet
Then you go, it's another room and you don't have to hear it
Or I could just fucking deal with it as I have to
Yes, that's definitely the way to go
But then I can't hear the game
Or I could get headphones
Yeah, that's another thing, headphones are good
Or you set it next to a PC that's even louder
And then it doesn't matter
Like the Orange Lounge Radio PC
Oh, that's nothing compared to...
I don't know if you can hear the monster fan on this thing
It is... I have the loudest...
Have you seen my PC?
Not in a long time
With its 200mm fan on top of it
And it's got like, you know
8 different fans that are on it
Plus there's 3 more inside the case
Plus there's a fan on each of the graphics cards
That are also hacked to be 100% all the time
It's like a jet engine
Alright, I don't want to bitch about noise anymore
People are probably sick of it
But I do want to read a comment from chatroom
Because this made me lull a little bit
The comment from chat was from SonOfDad
Says, Hannah Montana Xbox 360 Elite Skew for me please
PSP's doing it
There you go
Baby, baby poop purple
Xbox 360
If you want to join us in our chatroom
chat.orangeloungeradio.com
Well you know, Rob, that her new movie
She's gonna have to choose
Whether she's gonna be Miley Cyrus or Hannah Montana
How about she chooses to go jump in a lake
That would be...
Or deaf
She's deaf
Amazing
Alright
If I can't be both then I won't be any deaf
I'll just have to chop myself in half
Alright
Let's move on with more gaming news please
Do not let Loki ruin my show with Hannah Montana
Dear God no
Well how about something that I'm sure a lot of people have been waiting for
Rob, maybe you've been waiting for this, I don't know
What's that?
The Beatles on Rock Band
Actually it's the Beatles Rock Band Edition
A collaboration between Apple Corps, Harmonic, and MTV Games
And it's going to be all Beatles music
They're basically saying that they don't have any plans yet for downloadable content
But it is going to be stand alone, dedicated, just to the Beatles
So no importing your songs into other rock band games or any of that stuff is what it seems to imply
It's going to be all by itself
Which you know, it's the Beatles, they can do that
They're like the biggest band ever
Ever
And if you doubt this, of course I'm excited about a Beatles rock band game
I mean especially more so than some of these other bands
We've heard Metallica, Aerosmith, I'm sorry they're not the Beatles
They're good bands in their own way but I'm not as excited about that as the Beatles
Songs have lasted forever, sorry
Actually you're also going to be doing a limited edition premium bundle for $250
On all platforms, that would be Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii
That will have instruments modeled after the ones that the band actually played
So hey, that might mean Hofner bass
That's a little excessive for me
I wouldn't get it but I can see where collectors and hardcore Beatles fans would be all over that crap
So that's not a surprise
For me, I just want the game
But that's good for that audience, that they're doing something like that
But yeah, I think this game is going to be pretty epic in that regard
And if you doubt that the Beatles are still huge
One site I finally started using again this past week was last.fm
I know we have an Orange Islands Radio group on last.fm
If you haven't seen it, it's linked from our site
But I finally re-signed up for this site because I was trying to discover some new music
And if you look at the top bands that are played on last.fm
The Beatles are still there in the top ten
And that's all the music out of anywhere
So if you doubt that the Beatles are still huge
You're wrong
But Miley Cyrus is bigger
No, Miley Cyrus is not bigger
At least according to last.fm
Granted, not everybody on the planet uses last.fm
But it certainly
$250 seems an awful lot of money for, I don't know, Beatles rock band stuff
I mean, am I going to get part of some of the Beatles corpses in there?
Or the hair that you used to get, that they used to sell
No, I can understand why it's going to command a higher price
Because they can get away with it
There's going to be people that are willing to pay it for the Beatles
I just probably won't be one of them
But I'm still excited about the game
Did you hear the controversy on how people think that the Wii version is going to be $59.99 for just the software only?
They're like, $59.99? What the hell?
Everything is only $50!
That is the cap for Wii games
Not $59.99, it's $49.99
Says who?
Well, says the world
I don't know
I think back a long, long time ago on the Super Nintendo to when Street Fighter II came out
If I remember right, I could be wrong
But if I remember right, Street Fighter II when it first came out was like $79.99 on the Super Nintendo
That was, I mean, and this was years ago
This isn't counting for inflation, granted in the current economy
I think we're back to where we were when that game came out
But all that aside, you know, $79.99 was a lot of money
And it certainly was more money than you were seeing for other games at the time
I believe a lot of Super Nintendo games at the time were going for the $49.59
No, I think they were like $39 or $49 back then
But I remember Street Fighter II especially was very expensive
Maybe it was only $69.99
I just remember it was much more expensive
But it was Street Fighter II!
Who didn't want to buy that game back in that day when that first came out?
I honestly don't think it's going to come out for $59.99
I think that's actually a misprint
But whatever, people are going to stick with it for now
And they'll have a big controversy
But I don't see a lot of people picking it up for $60 if that's the case
Even if it is the Beatles, because who gives a shit?
It's the Beatles
I know I'm not picking it up
I don't give a shit about the Beatles, so whatever
A couple chatters are correcting saying it was $69.99
Maybe there's, I'm thinking like $70 in my mind
Rama says Sky at Toys R Us it was $69
Local Shops had it for $79
And Game Guru says it was $69.99
Son of Dad said it was $69.99 at KB Toys
I don't know how you guys remember that
Or if you just looked it up on the internet real quick
But still, still, they don't charge $69.99 for games now
I can't think of any games that aren't collector's editions that go for that price
So you know, I'm just saying
Who's to say they can't charge whatever they want for the game
If they know it's going to be in high demand
And that people are willing to pay that for
You know, what is arguably going to be a premium game
I mean it's not like we're talking about
You know, Carnival Games 2
Trying to command a price of $59.99
We're talking about the frickin' Beatles
So, you know, I don't know
I won't buy it for the Wii
Why are you talking crap about Carnival Games 2?
I don't know
I want to know
I'm not talking crap
I'm just saying I won't pay $69.99 for it
Carnival Games 2, it's worth that kind of money
Interesting comment from Marissa Cungusto in the chat
And I know that's the lovely Marissa
Who hasn't been on our show in a long time
But I think she needs to grace us with her presence again sometimes
True Beatles fans are more nuts about the music than gimmicks
But people do get nuts
Look at all the Elvis crap
Interesting perspective
Alright, let's move on
By the way, the release date of this game, 9-9-9
Ten years after the release of the Dreamcast
What a fun day to release stuff
And I believe, as I was hearing on a Bobby show earlier tonight
One of their chatters said something
Final Fantasy VIII was out on that same day too
So September 9th is a fun day
Really?
9-9-9
Final Fantasy VIII was out on that day too
No, I think it was out on September 9th of a different year
It's not the same
It's not quite the same
Anyways, so there's another rumor
Honestly, this isn't actually a rumor
I've seen it
Activision is preparing to release Guitar Hero Van Halen
Later this year
August, to be exact
And it will be coming out, of course, with some of the more popular Van Halen tracks
You know, Jump, Panama, Hot for Teacher
And also other bands' music are gonna be in there
Just like the Metallica stuff and Aerosmith
How can you have Jump without keyboards?
How?
I don't get that
How can you do that without keyboards?
I mean, I know, but I always thought of Jump as a keyboard song
In fact, there's a local store in town
I don't remember if it was Guitar Center or Skip's or one of those stores
You had the keyboards all on display at the store, right?
But they had these big songs that the following songs are banned
Do not play them on these keyboards or we will kick you out of the store
One of them was Jump
You couldn't play the chords
Like you couldn't play it, like that and for release
And all the other stuff
Like they would kick you out of the store if you played that
That's hilarious
It reminds me of that scene from Wayne's World
No stairway, tonight
Exactly, it totally reminded me of that
No stairway, denied
No chopsticks, I know chopsticks had to be one of them
Other stuff, other songs that might be in there as well
Juice Priest's Painkiller, Tenacious D's Master Exploder
Which you might remember was from Rock Band 2
And Weezer's Dope Nose
Of course, this is all to be taken as rumor right now
But no, it's not a rumor, it's actually coming out
It's gonna be just like Guitar Hero, Metallica
So expect that later on this year
However, that is not all that you can expect later on this year
Cause that's one of the millions of different Guitar Hero games that are coming out this year
Well actually Hero games
Including the previously announced Guitar Hero Modern Hits
Also supposedly this year, Guitar Hero 5 or whatever they're gonna call it
Band Hero, how that is any different than Guitar Hero 5 is beyond me
Another Guitar Hero on tour game for the DS and DJ Hero
I guess they weren't kidding when they were talking about the whole 5 Guitar Hero games in a year or something like that
I think it's a little overkill if you ask me
But I know I'm not buying any of these, except for DJ Hero maybe
That's a maybe
Marissa in chat again says it's true about Stairway, try playing it in Guitar Center
I don't doubt it, I'm sure they would get very angry at having to hear that song
It's just like I hear on American Idol, certain songs are banned from the auditions too
Like you can't sing Alicia Keys' Falling in your audition
I don't know why I know that, I must have read it on Wikipedia or something
Robert M on the last story makes it funny about the release date of the Beatles Rock Band game
The Beatles Rock Band release date, number 9, number 9, number 9
It's kind of a real nerdy joke there
It's also the same day as The Nine is released by Tim Burton
Which looks awesome
Is that a game or a movie?
It's going to be a movie and a game
Oh of course, I had to ask, of course if it's a big movie it's going to be a game as well
I thought the next Tim Burton movie was the Alice in Wonderland movie
No, the Nine is the next one
Unless Alice in Wonderland, I don't think Alice is coming out this year
No I think it's out in 2010
I love Alice in Wonderland and all that stuff, I'm really excited about the new movie
Anyway, more Guitar Hero
And this is a follow up to a story we reported on a couple, probably a few months ago at this point
I'm sure our FUs of the Week came right after this particular story
Do you remember when Gibson sued the makers of Guitar Hero?
That's right, Gibson had sued over the whole patent they had on musicians simulating participation in a concert
And all this stuff, like they tried to claim basically that they invented Guitar Hero
Even though Guitar Hero worked with them to make the controllers or what have you
Well guess what?
It was lost, their patent suit was lost
And essentially was practically laughed out of court
Is what happened with that
Let's see, this was from the US District Court for the Central District of California
Let's see, the court said it's toys that represent other items there
Also apparently Gibson's patent only originally applied to devices which use the analog audio signals
Not MIDI signals or any other types of control signals
So, there it is
Suck it Gibson
Yeah, it was a little bit silly of them in the first place as we discussed previously
But I guess you could say justice was served
I guess you could say they hacked the Gibson
Aha, aha, aha, give me that
Sad trombone
Well, while we're on the subject of the guitar games, whatever
Guitar Hero Greatest Hits will be out in June
And should have 48 songs, including Them Bones by Alice in Chains, Killer Queen
Killing in the Name, Through the Fire and the Flames
It's basically pulling songs from the other Guitar Hero games and putting them in one game
I guess the only cool thing about this is that now they're gonna get the band treatment
Like I was reading somewhere that Through the Fire and the Flames is supposed to have crazy hard drums on it
To match the crazy hard guitar part
But still
I wanna play the vocals for that
Still, if you listen carefully, listen carefully
And you might be able to hear the sounds of this franchise getting milked to death
Cause that's what's happening, I mean really
It's a slurping noise
That's like, okay, the other day I was looking on iTunes
And they have like greatest hits for like Wilson Phillips
Wilson Phillips had what, like two big songs and two CDs
Does this really necessitate a greatest hits album?
That's how I feel about this whole Guitar Hero thing
Is there really enough out there that necessitates this Guitar Hero Greatest Hits album?
How about this for more milking, Rob? It's gonna be out on Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, and PS2
I'm not surprised though, all the Guitar Hero stuff is milked on all the systems
But seriously, it's amazing, you go into stores now, like Fries and Best Buy
There's an entire aisle practically dedicated to these games now
And I mean it's because they sell, obviously
And because they're huge, like literally the boxes are huge
One day though, one day the bottom's gonna fall out from this market
It's gonna be kinda sad
And it's gonna be Activision's fault
Don't be like Konami, don't hoard DDR
I just, you know, again, at least bring a keyboard or something like that
And Rama says in chat, Sky, if Rick Astley can have a greatest hits album, so can Wilson Phillips
Good statement, good statement
That could possibly be the chat comment of the evening, we'll see
Alright, let's get into some release dates from around the world, lowkey
Alright, well in the US, we have a few games coming out this week
Starting off with Stuff for the Wii
We've got New Play Control Pikmin and New Play Control Mario Tennis
Slightly old but yet new
My Pet Shop for the Nintendo DS, which is being released by Taito
And features Mama from Cooking Mama
Except now she's working in a pet shop
Is there anything Mama can fix?
I don't want to know
I need Mama to fix my life
I don't know, maybe she's hunting for ingredients
We need Relationship Mama, that's what I need
I need Mama to fix my dating life
That's what I want, no I'm kidding
Eve Online Special Edition coming out on PC
World Championship Track and Field on the DS
Animal Planet Emergency Vets for the DS
Yet another pet fixing sim, literally
My Sims Party on the DS and on the Wii
Coming out this week
Totally Spies, Totally Party on the Wii and on PS2
Docomo Dake Boing on DS
It's a weird game with some giant mushroom, I don't know
Can we say that again?
Docomo Dake Boing
Trivial Pursuit coming out on Playstation 2
Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360
Mad World on the Wii, that game looks awesome
Gotta love a game with chainsaws
And yes, that's an awesome looking game on the Wii
That is what we just said, yes
Monokimia Student Alliance on the PSP
Let's see here, Avalon Code on the DS
Zubo on the DS, that game looked like crap
Let's see here, SPK Superbike World Championship
On the PS2, Xbox 360, PSP, and PS3
My English Coach Spanish Edition
Yes, that's a game for people that don't speak English
And that's on the DS
World in Conflict, the complete edition on PC coming out this week
And a few more things here, Vacation Sports on the Wii
Another party game collection
And finally Save the Best for Last, Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Xbox 360
And speaking of Xbox 360, you can get your limited edition
Red Xbox 360 Elite System
Some praise for Mad World in chat, Lazy Days, Mad World looks cool
Deep Man, can't wait for Mad World
It's nice to see a Wii game getting some fanboy lovin'
There you go
It's got John DiMaggio in it, I mean the voice of Bender
And Greg Proops from Whose Line doing sports commentary while you murder people with a chainsaw
What more do you want?
That's pretty amazing
I randomly met Greg Proops like years ago
It's nice to see that he still do it, because he had that game show
I met him right around the time he had that game show going on
And then that got cancelled, and then Whose Line wasn't on anymore
So I'm really glad to see he's around still
It's so awesome
Can't wait to play this game
You need to bring it over, I want to check it out
I don't know enough about this game, but you follow the chainsaw
It's like the Running Man meets Sin City
You follow those types of games better than I do, I will readily admit
Anyhow, let's move over to Japan and check out the Japanese release dates
I'm being distracted though with pictures
The Dark Sakura is showing me of her old cosplay
I actually found a lot of old photos that I'm actually sorting through
And going to throw away the really bad ones
But I just found my pictures that I took at a cemetery in Alabama
There was one of you cosplaying as Emi though, I thought that one was really cute
This particular photo that I will go and put on the camera in a second
Is from the Churchreach Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama
Of the only Revolutionary War veteran buried there
So that means that he had to have been listed when he was 15
Lots of love for Greg Proops in our chatroom apparently
That's awesome!
We should try to get him on the show or something
Nah, I don't know about that, that's like stretching the boundaries of you
Well, why not?
He's a voice actor in a video game, maybe he wants to sell the game
If the game does well, he'll want him back for a sequel
You never know
Alright, anyway, forget it
Let's move on to some Japanese release dates
Coming out in Japan, of course since we're getting it over here
You know Japan's gonna be getting Resident Evil 5 over there
Actually, I think that just came out this last week
Yeah, it came out last week
But, they are getting, I know this is new
The Idolmaster Twins is new on the Xbox 360
Idolmaster is a pretty big franchise over there
And now it's got twins
So, on the Playstation 3, Army of Two gets a price reduction
As it goes into EA's best hits collection as does Need for Speed Pro Street
But if you want to get some new games in Japan, Resistance 2 is actually new for Japan
In some DualShock packs
Musou Orochi Z is coming out from Koei this week as well
Over on the Playstation 3, and Skate also getting a price reduction
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii
Phantom Brave Wii is coming out this week on March the 12th
As is Sonic Tokunokishi comes out as well
I'm not sure what this, oh this is Sonic and the Black Knight
Over in Japan
Wii Cheer gets its release in Japan this week as well
Because I know you guys can't wait for a Wii Cheer over there
And Boku to Sim no Machi Party comes out as well from EA
My Sims Party
Is this My Sims Party?
Yeah
That is, that is
Also coming out on the Playstation 2, Galaxy Angel 2
Need for Speed Pro Street getting a reduction
And that's it for the Playstation 2 this week
Let's look at the handhelds real quick on the Nintendo DS
Tokumiki Memorial Girls' Side First Love Plus comes out from Konami this week
Also coming out from Konami, or I'm sorry, a price reduction for Survival Kids
Also coming out Konami Dual Spirits, the DS game
Actually that's another price reduction, I was going to say that game's been out a while
The Sims Party game also coming out from EA on the DS this week
Retai Picross comes out from Nintendo this week
First party game on the Nintendo DS
And quickly looking to see if the PSP is getting any love this week
Well they are, you get Ever17, the Out of Infinity Premium Edition comes out from Cyberfront this week
As well as Never7, the End of Infinity
Resistance Restribution also coming out on the PSP this week
And that looks to be about it, unless you're looking for a price reduction on Need for Speed Pro Street
So that's it for the Japanese release dates
Well how about some UK release dates, as soon as I set my photos down
Sure, let me read a quick chat comment while you're doing your photos
AcidicVampire in chat says, when I play Wii Cheer, I actually attach streamers to my Wiimote to make them feel like real pom poms
You joke, you joke, but they sell those things for the Wiis
I was going to say, I'm surprised they don't sell those
No, they do sell those, they sell Wii pom pom attachments for your damn remotes
Yes, people are that retarded
I kind of want one for some reason, but I'm going to make mine
Well remember, you can use it for every game, so you know
Because I want to play MadWorld with my pom poms, yay, go cheer, cut you in half
That's hilarious
I'll put this on the camera in a moment or if you want to do it for me
This cat is 27 years old
Oh my heck, alright, get to the release dates
Okay, let me give you the photo, his name is Sean
That's my cat from Alabama
Anyway, coming out on
I think he's a zombie
That's the only way we can explain that he's lived that long
He's alive by the power of evil
I've already said last week on the 8th and 9th that Flock was out
The 10th, Tomb Raider, Underworld, Lara's Shadow on Xbox 360
Bleach Dark Souls, Codename Panzer's Cold War on PC, Persona 4
Oh, by the way, those last few were on the 13th
Resident Evil 5 on the 13th, Resistance Retribution
Ocom, Frontation, Sonic and the Black Knight, Tom Clancy's Hawks on PC
Cool
Tigerclaw just linked in chat
Sorry, I just saw a picture of those stupid attachments
Oh god, I almost want them just for the sheer gayness of it
I feel like I need to own it
I don't know what it is, but I'm just compelled to purchase it
Even though it only has a 1.5 star rating
Dude, $19.99 for two little pieces of plastic that you tape on to the ends of your Wiimotes
That's amazing
We finally got a SKU for the Wii Music Instruments
They have attachments for all those too
So you can look like a douchebag playing those
I want to point out, Amazon looks like they're having a sale
You can get that and a Wii Cheer and All Star Cheer Squad
Play together $84.97 for the Ultimate Cheerleader Pack
Oh god, alright
Waaaaaame
Anyways, there's going to be a new Pac-Man game on the way
This is to celebrate the game's 30th anniversary
Good lord, you know, I remember just a few years ago when we were at E3
when they were celebrating the 25th anniversary
Now, of course, the 30th anniversary will become 2010
So, not surprising there
And, no word on exactly what it is
I guess Namco Bandai, America's Makoto Iwai
said, as a group, we feel that we should do something to make him come back
So there's one project that we've started working on
And I guess Yasu Hara is part of it
And says the new game design was sort of meeting his wish 100%
So, I have no idea what the hell that means, but it's going to be a Pac-Man game
So, set your expectations low
Well, I mean, the last Pac-Man game that came out was really awesome
Pac-Man Championship Edition is pretty great
Even Pac-Man Versus was pretty fun too
But, yeah, I mean, not every Pac-Man game has been a winner
It's Pac-Man, I mean, it's like
If Pac-Man ran faster, we'd be having the same problem as Sonic
But, uh, I'm kind of curious to see how they're going to reinvent Pac-Man
There are Pac-Pics, that seemed like a good idea
I love Pac-Pics
Until you played it, then you're like, wow, this sucks
Yeah, Pac-Pics, it was one of those things that was neat in a small dose
Like, it was a great demo to show the DS off with
But, as a game, eh, nah, didn't hold my attention
Pac could roll, that was kind of lame
You know what, Pac-Man, that Pac-Pics game
Like, you know how they're doing this DSI download service
Where games are only going to be a couple of bucks
You know, their whole little digital distribution thing
Pac-Pics would have been a great candidate for, like, a little $5 game there
That would have been, I think, where it would have been best served
But, obviously, they didn't have that at the time, so whatever
Um, anyhow
Just found a picture of Jason
What? Our webmaster Jason?
How old are these pictures? What are these all from?
E3, O, almost
O4, probably, right?
Yeah, I found a really bad picture of us
Oh, boy
Oh, I remember that picture
That's blurry
I look cute
Alright, hey, talking about pictures makes for great radio, doesn't it?
Hey, uh, Konami
You know our friends at Konami, they are turning 40 years old this week
If you can believe it
You're over the hill!
Congratulations, Konami, you're old
No, Konami has officially turned 40 this week
And, uh, quoting on the age of the company and how they did it
The European president, Kuno Nio, says
Consistency plays a major part in everything Konami does
I don't know if that means, you know, rehashing their games over and over
No, I'm kidding
Obviously, Konami's put out a lot of great games that we've loved very much over the years
So, there you have it
Konami also promises that there are a wealth of other new titles in development
By the way, a game that I left out of my gaming week was the DDR on the iPhone
Was a game that I actually played this week, the brand new one
They have DDR on iPhone now
Um, it's alright
You know, considering it's DDR on your iPhone
I mean, you don't actually dance
But, um, here's the thing
There's this new mode they have called shake mode
Where you actually play DDR by tilting your iPhone to the left and to the right and up and back
You know, which is kind of stupid but cute
But here's the weird thing
You only can play the tutorial song in shake mode
Like, is that a bug? Seriously?
Like, you were only meant to play the tutorial song and nothing else?
Like, did somebody forget to put that pointer in that says
Oh, after the tutorial, go back to the song select and not the main menu
So, I don't know
A little strange
But, the game has a lot of songs, I guess
You know, it's got like 26 songs or something like that
But you only have like 9 to start
You have to unlock them all slowly but surely
And I don't know, I hope there's an unlock code or something
Because I don't know if I can stand to just play these songs over and over again on the iPhone
But, you know, it is a lot of newer DDR songs
There's some old ass stuff mixed in there
But here's the thing that surprised me most
Did you know Brilliant To You now has a vocal version?
It's kind of scary
That's all I have to say
Like, I've been out of the DDR loop for so long
I had no idea there was a Brilliant To You now with vocals
Is it voluntary singing?
No, it's not voluntary, it's a dude
Or is it that really awful dude that like
What was it, did that crappy rap that was in uh
It could very well be for all I know
But, yeah, there's
You know, DDR music is interesting now
It's, you know, back in my day
It was a lot different
Getting these kids off your damn lawn?
Although, there was a Naoki and Smile DK song that was kind of cool
Because like, hey, Smile DK, you know
They kind of weren't around in Bamani for a long, long time
Well, there is
There is new DDR coming out
Like, later this month
Yeah, there's the, what, Hottest Party 2?
No, it's Disney Grooves
That's right, the DDR Disney
I keep getting emails about another one too that's still in development
I thought it was another Hottest Party game
No, well, I'm sure there will be another Hottest Party game of me
Because they keep putting that crap out
I don't know, it's just
Can't be excited about this stuff anymore
I will be more excited about DDR when there's something that's really reinvented it
You know, I don't know, even just going to different versions of music
I have a way to do it, but no one wants to give me the money to do it
I know
Alright, let's move on, some more gaming news
Enough reminiscing about the past 40 years of Konami
But, but, but, but, but we like the past
Yeah, that's true, and I think back to the Konami of the 80s
The old school Metal Gear game was amazing
But anyway
Well, how about some different news
Ubisoft has actually pulled a game called I Am Alive
That's being developed by Darkworks
From their lineup
They announced it at E3 that they wanted to release it
This spring, but it's actually been delayed until March 2010
Because it's apparently such an ambitious title that they want to do it justice
So, let's hope so
It was funny though, actually they announced it
Yeah, it's coming out in March
And they're like, uh, yeah, about that
It's actually financial year 2010
Oopsie
We jumped the gun there
So, sometime between now and March
Sweet
Anyways, there's something else that's kind of interesting
You remember we talked a little bit about it
That Square Enix was starting to buy up some shares of Eidos
Well, Square Enix is hoping to finish buying the rest of Eidos by May
And they're actually expected to approve a deal with the Eidos shareholders
Later this month
And hopefully by May 6th
There will be, I don't know
I guess they'll be under the ownership of Square Enix
That's kind of interesting though
Because my thoughts are, why would you want Eidos?
I mean, really, it's Eidos
Well, they do own Tomb Raider rights
And there's a new Tomb Raider movie coming out
So maybe they're going to try and do a different type of Tomb Raider game for it
I don't know
Maybe try to reboot some of the franchises
Doesn't Eidos also have, uh, is it Hitman that they have?
Yeah
That was another big one they have
You know, that was a fairly successful number one movie
I suppose
They have some big franchises that just need a swift kick in the butt
Well, maybe they can just pick up this company
So that they can just develop straight RPGs for, you know
From Square Enix
And they all have to worry about branching out into other games
Because they can have Eidos do the other game genres
Now what are we going to call them?
Game Guru in our chat room suggests Squeenix Titos
You know, here's funny though
They actually had it on this article here
It's Square Idocs
Game Guru in chat says
Square Enix wants franchises that aren't JRPGs
And that could be, you know, there has been those stories
About they want to get more into, you know, the more American style of the game development
So why not?
Yeah, but I mean, this is about like half a step from, you know
Buying out Atari or something
I mean, no offense, it's just like
Eidos is not what they used to be
Tomb Raider is definitely not what it used to be
And, you know, there are other franchises, you know
The ones that they still put out aren't what they used to be
And they haven't been really that great
Well, they obviously see something in it that maybe they can turn around
Maybe that's why they're able to buy them out
Because the shares are so low
I don't know, it's just
Whatever, I mean, if you're Square and you've got lots of money then
I guess it's fine to buy out Eidos
Well, hey, this game company seems to be doing something right
Because apparently, according to Nintendo Power's recent issue
A boy and his blob is coming back on the Wii pretty soon
That's kind of cool, this is coming from WayForward
Is the company that's making this game
Now, you might remember a little while ago
They were kind of testing this on the DS
There was a DS version of the game that was under development
But then it ended up getting cancelled
I remember playing this at E3 going like
Wow, it's a boy and his blob
But now, apparently
It's going to be reinvented on the Wii
And there's more information in this month's Nintendo Power magazine
So that could be interesting
Remember a boy and his blob?
Yes
It's kind of a neat game
A little bit of a short game
But, you know, back on the NES
It was kind of okay
Because it took a long time to figure out how to beat it
And get a cheat guide
But this could be kind of cool
I don't think it's a remake of the first game though
I think it's probably a whole new thing
But it definitely was an interesting concept
If you don't remember what a boy and his blob was
Basically, it was kind of a puzzle game
You had the blob and you were the boy
And you could walk around and the little blob would follow you
And if you fed the blob different flavors of jelly beans
Then the blob would turn into different objects
Like the blob could turn into a ladder
The blob could turn into a trampoline
Or a key
You know, it would just basically shape shift all these different things
So you were kind of
It was a puzzle game basically
And you really had just enough jelly beans
To figure out the answer to the puzzle
And get to the exit or whatever it was you were doing
So, it could be interesting to see how this plays out
In, you know, many many years later
Or what, probably like 20 years since this game was first out
It does look really cool that it's all hand drawn
Yeah, that could be very cool
So
Hitstun in chat points out the way forward also made Contra 4
So
Dark Tetsuya asks about the brick wall trick
No, I don't remember that
I do seem to remember there was a really easy way you could cheat
In Boy and His Blobs, that must be what he's talking about
So
Dan Shadow asks, is Jelly Belly paying for this?
I don't know, it could be a good sponsorship
I love Jelly Bellys
No, they have Jelly Belly ballistic beans
Do they really have a game like that?
They have a game that's coming out in April
In April or May
It's Jelly Belly ballistic beans
It's like, um
Bust a move
Um
You know, the
Puzzle Bobble type of game
Um, you know Jelly Belly
Doesn't make the Harry Potter beans anymore
They, uh, I guess lost the licensing agreement with that
So now they have their own, like, sad flavor of Jelly Beans lined
Like, have you ever had those nasty Jelly Bellys?
Like in the, you know, vomit flavor and all that stuff?
Blah
I love Jelly Bellys
Anyway, alright
Sorry, I guess the Boy and His Blob story is making me hungry
Uh, we're almost to a little break here
If you are craving food
We just have a few more stories to get through
And then we're gonna be taking a break
And of course we also have the classic game of the week
Which we'll be getting to in just a little bit
After a few more stories
Right, Dark Sakura?
Right, Rob!
Hey, hey
I actually just saw something that made me laugh
That I'm gonna post in the chat room
And what is that, may I ask?
Here, look for yourself
Okay
Hold on, let's see
Someone did a parody of what the Watchmen ending was gonna be like
Oh, is this gonna spoil the actual movie?
Cause I haven't seen it yet
No, Rob, it won't
Hahaha
Candy Mountain
Yeah
Nice
Okay
That's fantastic
Sorry, that's terrible radio
It's bas- nevermind
At least our live listeners can look at that
Anyway, um
How about some UK Virtual Console stuff?
And this makes me happy
It's fun stuff
It's Clu Clu Land!
We remember Clu Clu Land
I do, I remember playing it in Animal Crossing on the GameCube
Yep, and I played it on the Nintendo when it was new
Back in the day
Um, basically you just have to turn bubbles and make gems and stuff
And it's 500 Wii Points
And then Mega Drive title
Wonder Boy 3 Monster Lair
So, um
Which I think as we got it was Wonder Boy Monster Land
I think we just got that on Virtual Console ourselves over here too
Yeah
That's 800 Wii Points
So, go get em!
Go get em!
280 games for the Virtual Console available now
Yeah, then I'm not interested in any
Oh my god
Unfortunately
That's a lot
Still no Guardian Legend
You wanna know what?
I probably have that many in the vault
I wish I was joking
No, I wouldn't doubt it
It's just, you know, a lot of
I probably have that many ROMs, no I'm kidding
You know kinda why I wish I was joking?
Why?
Cause we're sorting them all
Fun
Lord
You need to get some big plastic bins
We got em actually
Well, while I may not be interested in
The Virtual Console
I am interested in something else that's coming out on the Wii
That would be Excitebots Trick Racing
And we actually got some details on it
Other than just a name now
We have pictures of the box art that came out
Which looks interesting
Which was promptly stolen and put all around the rest of the internet
Yeah, because I don't give a shit
So, whatever
So anyways, yeah, box art
Which shows robotic animals
Yeah, with wheels and stuff
That's kinda neat
Another interesting stuff
Before I was kinda worried
The description made it sound like a party game and stuff
It actually looks like Excite Truck
And it looks pretty sweet
Although there is weird stuff in there
Like there's a robotic turtle carrying a tambourine for some reason
And I'm not sure why
And then there's some other stuff that I saw with like
Throwing pies at clowns and stuff like that
So that's weird
But it's still Excite Truck
Can I throw rocks at clowns?
No, just pies
But they're big pies
But it's just
They're rock pies?
No, they're big pies
But the game basically plays very similar to Excite Truck
It's based on a star system
Not necessarily
You can get in first place
Obviously helps you
But if you don't get in first place
It doesn't really matter
Because it's all about who has the most star points
At the end of the race
And you get points for doing different things like
Tree runs
Catching air, doing air tricks
Jumps, whatnot
So very similar to Excite Truck
The controls are going to be exactly the same
And they've added a few different things in there as well
Now they have these new energy poles
That you can swing around
And gain a boost off of that
Lots of fun stuff
And then there's also some other game modes in there as well
Hopefully optional
That you can play poker by
Driving through cards
Based on what you get
You get points on the hands
And then also the clown thing
Which I don't know how that plays
But you basically throw a pie at a clown
As you're driving around
Nonetheless
It looks interesting
They've got vehicles flying through the air
And stuff like that
Plus you get a power up where your character
Is able to run with its legs and stuff
Any word about internet play like Mario Kart?
There was no word on that
But as I remember mentioning before
Two to six players online
Interesting
And one to two players split screen
Local
Very very interested in checking this out
And the wife is extremely excited
It looks interesting
But here's the thing about it
Didn't we hear that this developer
Was working on something that was so secret
They had to have the secret screens and all this stuff
And I don't know if maybe somebody was just embellishing it or whatever
But I'm really thinking in the back of my mind
Is this game really that big of a deal
That they had to keep it super top secret?
It looks good
It really does look good compared to Excite Truck
And actually the graphics are a lot better
I don't know, I'm very interested
To check it out
They could have a really good game on their hands
I think the robotic lizard
Frog thing is kind of cool
They're going to have a mouse in there that they can play as
A robotic mouse, but the turtle looks retarded
I'm sorry, he's got this retarded
Look on him
Like he's been touched in the head or something
I don't know, but
I don't have to play as a turtle
And there's also Ladybug that flies through the air
Alright, well some
New details about another anticipated Wii game
Has hit the internet this week
It's about Punch-Out!
Punch-Out is coming out in May
But apparently some other new details have leaked out
About the game, including the fact that some
Of the best of the original Punch-Out!
Cast will be returning
King Hippo obviously was seen in some screenshots
Glass Joe is going to be in there
Von Kaiser apparently is going to be making a comeback
Not exactly one of the fighters
I would have thought would be the best of the original
Which started Make Me Fearful
Because I think somebody said on this show a couple weeks ago
Maybe this is just going to be a complete remake of the first game
No, they're actually going to have new characters in there
It's even says
There's going to be some new characters in the game
Star Punches are coming back into the game
No word on how you get them yet
But that could be interesting
By the way, Punch-Out! is also going to have two
Different control schemes
Of course there is the one
That will be the whole, you know, waving your arms
Around in the air, but apparently
Also classic NES
Style controls
If you flip your Wii remote on the side
And play the game, you can play the game that way
So that's kind of cool
For those of us that don't want to flail our arms around everywhere
You can still have some fun with Punch-Out!
So there you go
Well, obviously Punch-Out!
Is a very classic video game
But we like to put the spotlight on the classic game
Every week here on Orange Laundrio
And I can tell you this week it's not Punch-Out!
But it is some game that you should definitely be checking out
And it's Dark Sakura's classic game of the week
She's going to dig through her archives
And pull out a game
That she wants to share with all of you
Dark Sakura, what is the classic video game
Of the week this week?
The classic game is Plio Plio
It is a puzzle game
That was created
By Compile for the MSX2
And
It actually uses
Characters from
Mado Monogatari
So it's just a fun little game
That's where you drop
These bean shaped thingies
And have to match them up
But you can do drops
And make chain combos
And I think it's been
One of the
I'd say
Blueprints for many other
Puzzle games to come out since
Sort of like Puzzle Fighter, remember?
Where you had your chains and everything
Basically
It's
We got it in the US as Puyo Pop
And we first
Saw it though as Dr. Robotnik's
Mean Bean Machine
Genesis and Good Drive
Came out of Game Gear and Master System
Which that version actually came out in Europe
And Brazil
And then we got it as
Kirby's Ghost Trap
Which was the
European SNES version
And Kirby's Avalanche
Which was our version of it
So
Basically
The whole point of it
Is that you have to stack up
The Puyo
And you have to
Match them up and
Get them in certain combos so that
You can throw that many
Number of lines
Over on your enemy
Who is also playing simultaneous
Either the enemy or the computer
And they can block your moves by getting
Combos of their own, but basically
Whoever has a higher combo
Then they get to
Sit over there, it's actually called
Rensa
The chain
Of how they pop and fall
Is called Rensa
So you can have any different kind of
Variety of it for how they fall
And the blocks that fall on the other side
Are called
Ojama
Which are garbage blocks
Or as we get them
They're new sets of Puyo
So
Basically, like I said, the higher that you get
The more that you drop on your opponent
That they do not block
I'm sorry, this battle I'm watching on YouTube
Is quite epic
My god, these players are amazing
They're setting up chains left and right
I have seen the 19
Chain
Rob that someone managed to get
That's pretty freaking epic
And actually this version of the music is from Puyo Puyo 2
That I thought was cool
But basically
You've got single Puyo
Where basically you just fight the computer
And then you have the versus mode
Which is double Puyo Puyo
You've got characters in the game
Which we've seen a few of them in other games
Because actually, Carp Uncle made his way
Made a brief appearance in Dr. Robotnik's
B&B machine
And it was called Has-Been
In that game
But you have
Maja who is the main character
Blue girl with brown hair wearing a blue dress
And um
You also
You know, also some of her chains
She calls out different spells
Because her character is apparently a sorceress
And then you've got Carp Uncle
Carp Uncle is cute
And then
For the first Puyo Puyo
You get Skeleton Tea, Nasu Grave, Mummy
Drako Centauros
Sukeidodora
Um
Skia Podes
Harpy
You actually have Zombie too
Which I think is cool
And my favorite name here is Zodamaio
And your boss is Satan
And you have to fight him
Because he likes Arl
But he really likes Carp Uncle
As far as other versions
That have come out
Like I said, we've had the US ones
That was Dr. Robotnik's
BB Machine, Koopa's Avalanche
Um
They're uh
They actually say that the
Puyo were
Supposed to be like how the
Slimes were in Dragon Quest
They're actually from that
RPG game Madou Monogatari
Which if anyone's played it, I'd love to know
Um, I haven't
But anyway, as other games came out
There was the
Puyo Puyo Pocket
And you had your Pocket Color one
So we've had Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2
We've had Puyo Pop over here
In Japan it was Vina De Puyo Puyo
Which means Everybody Puyo Puyo
Um
We've had Puyo Puyo Sun
Which there was actually a Nintendo 64 version
Puyo Puyo Sun 64
And a Saturn version
And Puyo Piyon
Which was um, pretty much the second one
We also had Puyo Puyo Fever
Which we got as Puyo Puyo Pop Fever
Um, that was on
Uh, actually that was
The last game that was released for the Dreamcast
So we've had
Versions on Xbox, Playstation 2
GBA, GameCube
DS, PSP
Even Mac versions, Widow versions
Pocket PC, Palm versions
DS, you know, all other
Kinds of versions, so
It's been pretty cool
I actually have the TurboGrafx version
At home
Which my friend gave me
They made this game on every damn system basically
Yeah, and you know there was actually
A music game sequel
Yeah, I remember, I think you showed it to me once
Yeah, you showed it to me once
Puyo Da
I thought it was just you
It's a fun little game
With Puyo Da, it's like
You have to hit the buttons at the right time
Sort of like, you know, Parappa-ish thing
But depending on how many you get right
You know, you get more points
And they get bombed
So it's an interesting little spinoff
Alright
Well that's going to do it, is that it?
I just had the line in there though
That I know that
It's not what she's saying
It's like the game psychic storm
And you translate the line the same way as I get pissed off
My husband's crazy
So it's the same
Alright
I believe that is going to do it
I hope he's listening because I picked this for him
Puyo Puyo
And apart from me because I love Puyo Puyo
Puyo Puyo is like my favorite puzzle game ever
You do bring it up on the show quite often
So I'm glad it's finally had a chance to be the game of the week
I'll link this other one
Because there's actually a Puyo Puyo anime
That was supposed to have been out too
And a lot of people do
Really freaky cosplay from it
And also I would say
If you want to get a recent version
Of Puyo Puyo
I got the Sonic Genesis collection
Because it has Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine
Which granted isn't a pure
Quote unquote version of Puyo Puyo
But you get at least the gist of the game itself
And you know it's part of that big collection
So there you go
There it is your classic game of the week Puyo Puyo
We're going to take a quick break here on Orange Launch Radio
But we will be back with plenty more in part B
We're going to talk about other companies getting into used game businesses
That should be interesting
Another game rental methods
And some classic fighting games
For fighters in the wake of Street Fighter IV
We're going to be talking about some of that
Coming up next here on Orange Launch Radio
Stay tuned
Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio
On this Sunday evening
March the 8th of 2009
Where we are taping live on AllGames.com
www.AllGames.com is the radio network that we are a part of
Or if you want to check out our show specifically
You can check out www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
You really should though check out both
You know you get a lot of time to surf the internet
I'm sure so you should check both sites out
Because they're both great
Alright we've been talking a lot about the latest and greatest in gaming
We're not done yet we've got plenty more
Let's talk a little more business now Loki
Yes let's talk business
Toys R Us is actually going to try to get into the used game business
They're going to start doing trade-ins I guess
Apparently an in-store advertisement
Which was snapped by one of the cheap ass gamer forum members
Actually showed that they're starting to do used game sales
In some select stores I guess like a trial period
Apparently you'll be able to return your games for I guess Jeffrey bucks
I'm sure it will be kind of similar to the gift certificate right?
Yes Jeffrey the giraffe dollars
Which have no currency whatsoever in the real world
But yes you will be able to sell your used games back
And receive store credit and no word on any pricing tiers
Or whether they're going to be competitive or not
But hey you know another option for trading in your used games is always welcome
Although to be honest man the last time I went into the Toys R Us it was sad
Like half the store was converted into a baby's R Us and that was really sad
Well I don't know if that's what sells you know
I remember those Toys R Us was the shit when I was a kid
It was amazing
It was so amazing
But you know now they have baby's R Us in there
Well you know if it sells it sells right?
I just remember back in the day they used to have like the Atari 2600 thing set up
You could play the old school games on there
But it's cutting into my Lego aisle you know
Well maybe that's because they have a Lego store at the mall you know
Well fuck the- wait what mall?
Arden mall they have like a full Lego store now
Are you shitting me?
I am not shitting you
That's so awesome
It's apparently like a chain of stores now
Good! We need a Lego store
They can get rid of the Apple store anytime though
But Lego store is awesome
I did not know you had such a fan boner for Legos
I have 10 gallons of Legos
I measure my Legos in volume now
Oh my god
Between her video game vault and your Legos like I feel like I need something
You know what I do have? I have a full dresser drawer
Full dresser drawer full of PEZ dispensers
I do have that
I guess that's my thing I don't know
One of these days I'll take them all out and put them on display again
But it was getting to be a hassle
They'd always fall over
People would come over and knock them over to be funny
Or they'd get punched over when somebody was drunk
That's messed up
Do you have one of those PEZ dispensers that dispenses like the whole like rolls of PEZ?
No I've seen those for sale though
I kind of quit PEZ collecting for a little while
Something I did like in high school and for a little while after that
But you know what the nice thing is since I stopped for so long
Now I have a lot of old PEZ dispensers that have just been sitting in a desk drawer
Not getting any sunlight or anything
They're in good condition I'm sure
But it's not that I'm in the buying and selling business of PEZ dispensers
You don't want to be one of those dudes on the food network during unwrapped or something
Like I watched one last night and they were talking about some guy that collected Mr. Peanut stuff
And he doesn't even like peanuts
He's just a douchebag that collects Mr. Peanut crap
It's like really? Okay
Of course some might argue that I collect Hello Kitty stuff
Because even like I'm making coffee right now
Like for those listening live that heard me during the break in the middle there
I'm brewing some coffee right now on my Hello Kitty coffee maker
With your Hello Kitty toaster that makes the Hello Kitty
Hey it works, don't hate
It brews a damn fine cup of coffee
And it was cheap, 20 bucks
So, whatever
Anyway, I don't know how we got from video games to Hello Kitty
But we can go back to talking about used games a little bit
You know what's interesting is that Toys R Us is kind of in cahoots with Amazon
So to kind of hear this
You know, because if you go to Amazon.com
Their toy section is all Toys R Us
Well Amazon.com is also running a trade-in program
Which would make sense if Toys R Us is doing this
Because they kind of have a little working agreement or whatever's going on
What you do, you can actually trade in games
You select games on their website apparently
They have to be in good condition
You send in a shipment or whatever
You print a shipping label on your computer
And you can actually send these games in
And they will actually send you an Amazon.com gift card
For however much the games were worth
Which is kind of interesting
Now this is something apparently I think is just being tested right now
I don't think it's actually starting just yet
But, yeah
I don't know
No, I guess it is up and live now
There you go, you can actually check it out on Amazon.com
I'm looking at the link right now
And yeah, you can actually look up on their site
Things you want to trade in
And sell back to Amazon.com and you'll get a gift card
Which, you know, considering that Amazon.com is much more than video games
I think this is where it could prove to be an interesting competitor to GameStop
Granted, GameStop, you can get cash for your games
You don't get a lot of cash
You get more if you go for the gift card
On Amazon.com, you can get
Books, DVDs
Heck, you can get appliances and stuff on the site
You can get airsoft guns
You can get a lot of stuff on Amazon.com
So it does open up this whole new door for that
You don't have to just trade in games for games
Oh yeah, and they also sell books
AgDeftInChat, chat.orangelandraday.com says
Rob sounds excited
I don't know, I don't ever sell games back
I probably should
I have a lot
I'm going to miss Drive Unlimited
I realize I had it sitting on my shelf collecting dust
I had no idea you even had it
Well, that's great, I'll plug that in and try it this week or something
But yeah, I don't know
DarkTotemic in chat says
Sky, really, the only thing GameStop has over these is
When you trade in a game, you can get a new one right away
Amazon, you'll have to wait for shipping
And that is a good counterpoint
Because yeah, I don't like to wait for shipping and all this stuff
I don't even like Netflix, because it's too slow
When I want to watch a movie, I want to watch it now
That's why I like Netflix Instant Queues, but let's face it, not everything is available on the Instant Queue
So, I don't know
DJ Rama S in chat says
Now at GameStop, you get the same amount if it's cash or credit
That must be a new thing
I don't know about that
It could be a promotion or something they're running right now
But it didn't used to be that way
Yeah, it seems kind of fishy
Because I'd be getting cash every time
Why now, do you think that they're getting into this?
Do you think it's just the state of the economy?
There's more of a demand for used games
Because $60 is a really high price point to get games
I don't know
Probably it's a big margin item
It's a business that has a good margin on it
Why not try to get into it?
Amazon is a powerful name
Online merchants
If they can put together a really valuable system that people want to check out
Because I remember reading the trade-in values for some of these games
And they were a few bucks higher than GameStop
But you've got to wait
A little bit longer
If you want to go that route
I guess you could
If you're kind of patient
I may look up some of my games to see if they're worth anything
If you're really patient
Just put them on eBay
Seriously
Did you know Beautiful Katamari is a rare game now?
On Xbox 360
I guess they don't print it anymore
When you find it online
It's actually kind of pricey
Kind of interesting
Damn
That's what I heard earlier today
DarkSoccer, I would ask for your opinion on this whole thing
But then I kind of realized you have a museum in your house
You probably never sell back video games
Do you?
Sometimes we do, but we just sell back the newer crap
Like sports games and shit
I see
Is this something that interests you at all?
Let's assume, hypothetically, your husband didn't manage
Direct competition of this whole thing
Do you think this Amazon.com thing is something that would be interesting?
I don't think so
We don't trade books at a video game store
We just take them back to his store
And trade them in for games at his store
Right, but let's say hypothetically
He didn't have that
Because not everybody has a husband that does that
I just thought I'd ask
Any more you want to add to this DarkSagra?
Good idea in theory
I think Chegg.com started the trend actually
For doing it online
For having schoolbooks that you could rent
And then trade in your old schoolbooks online
To them and then get credit
For stuff for your next
Semester schoolbooks
It is interesting how the internet will do this sometimes
Is that, you know, they might take an idea
Like, for instance, Gamefly was essentially
Kind of a rip-off of Netflix in a way
But it was, you know, for video games
So it's kind of interesting how you might take an idea
For one industry and kind of make it your own industry
And then, you know
That's your new business
But I don't know, anyway
Let's go on to the next story
Well, in other news
Speaking of GameStop
They've actually dropped
13%
In their stock value
Ever since Amazon announced
Their little trade-in deal
They actually
Ended
The day
On Thursday trading in at $3.54
Lower than it had before
So it looks like
That their investors are actually
Getting kind of worried about
Amazon's little plan
Even though GameStop themselves aren't
And looking at this
It's a fairly significant
Drop from what it was
Interesting
Another company
Is actually trying something a little bit different
As far as games go
Is actually Gamefly
Now Gamefly is testing out this brand new kiosk
Called the GBox
It's a game rental kiosk
It's gonna be
It's been spotted at Texas Tech University
They're probably gonna be launching
This
Probably on a limited basis right now
To check it out
It will allow you to rent
Games
For $2.49 a day
For, you know, Xbox 360
And PS3
And $1.99 a day for Wii
And it's gonna have new titles
And they're gonna carry them for, I guess, a short period of time
And apparently
Now no word yet
If this is gonna tie into
Your Gamefly subscription
Because that would be pretty cool
If you could actually have your
Gamefly subscription
And be able to say
Take these back to a kiosk
Instead of mailing them back in
That might be pretty cool
But I know definitely kiosk rentals
And stuff like that are pretty popular
They've, you know, hell with Redbox
And stuff and almost all the McDonalds
And all the grocery stores out there
It's not surprising that they're
Gonna do something like this
And actually I'm kind of interested in that
Hopefully they do put that out
Because $2.49 a night is not too bad actually
But if you compare it to
Say $8 for 5 days
I guess
It could become expensive
But if you just want a taste of a game
For like a day or something
Might not be a bad idea
I'm kind of dumb, the ones I see at Walmart
And stuff with the, you know, DVDs
But I have Netflix, I have Instant Netflix
You know, I have other ways to access movies
But then I think about this whole concept for games
And I'm kind of like, well, you know, if
Walmart right by my house had a box like this
I might be tempted to rent games
Rather than just
You know, purchasing them
For like $60
But you can kind of already do that at Blockbuster
And stuff, so I wonder what it is about these kiosks
That makes it so appealing
I don't know why I rent a new movie from a kiosk
Because you can get it at the same thing at Blockbuster
For the same price
Or, you know, for a longer period of time
Obviously, but you know, if you want to do it by night
It's all about convenience
Because once, you know, if something like this takes off
Then you're going to see a lot more of these people
Doing it, and I bet you anything
If Gamefly has good success with this
You'll probably see Redbox doing it
They'll probably just have some sort of hybrid kiosk
Where you can rent games and movies
And trust me, companies like that
Have thought about doing it
And they've tested it in some markets
But the problem is, though, is
They're retarded, and they think that they can
Make their money back on a game
Charging 99 cents a night
Well, that ain't the case, because games cost $60
Where movies cost $20
So it's obviously not going to make sense for them
You try to tell to them, they don't understand
Some comments from Chatroom, AcidicVampire
Kind of said the same thing you did
Redbox, the video game edition
So, perhaps just a matter of time
Blockbuster is still around, LOL
That's true, you know, these big box stores
Are having a hard time kind of staying in business
Because of just the competition they're getting from Netflix
And so on and so on
You know, I don't know, I think Blockbuster has a really interesting
Setup with the fact that they have
Their Netflix slash, what do they call it?
Blockbuster Total Access or something
It's like basically Netflix, okay
But it's Blockbuster stuff
And you can trade in the store
So that way they get around the whole shipping thing
If you don't want to wait for shipping, you can trade in the store
It's cool, but the thing that Netflix has on them
Is that Netflix has the streaming
And Blockbuster doesn't
Like if Blockbuster teamed up with PS3 or something
I would leave Netflix
And go to Blockbuster
You know, that was one of the rumors floating around
My own
That would be pretty big
You know, Blockbusters and stuff like that
The kiosks are good if you know what you're looking for
But a lot of the times
If you don't know what you're looking for
The kiosks are not really good
Because then you can't just browse stuff
I mean, they do have stuff
You can look at
But there's going to be a lot of people
Waiting for the stupid kiosk
And you kind of feel pressured
Let me ask a question to chat and everybody here
Kind of a little bit of a deeper question about this
And everybody in the studio and those in chat too
Is this type of announcement
Really a good thing for the gaming industry
Because if we're sitting here
Loki and I talking about
Maybe we'll stop making these $60 impulse buys
If we could just rent the game for $2.50
Out of one of these kiosks
In the long run, is this going to be a good thing
For the gaming industry
Or is this setting up the gaming industry to get shot in the foot
No, I think it is a good thing
And the reason why is because if this kiosk
Is going to be set up similar to say
A red box kiosk
Not only can you rent stuff from them
You can buy stuff from them
And so, just because they put stuff in there
People might like it
And they can purchase it from the kiosk
However though
On kind of the DVD movie side
Not everyone is on board with the whole kiosk things
In fact, there's a deal going on right now
With Universal
Where all their product is basically banned
From red box kiosks
They will not sell to red box
And they will find anybody that sells to them
And basically ruin any sort of deals
That have gone on
So, red box
The people that run those
Have to go out and actually purchase movies
From say a big box retailer
And then put them in their kiosk
But they can't purchase them directly
So they think that it's affecting their
Sell through business
By having these red box kiosks
Really when you look at the facts
That's not really the case
It's not really having a large impact on it
But that's the fear
But the thing is
With $60 games nowadays
I think a lot more people are renting things
But there's still those other rental avenues
You know, you don't necessarily
Need to use this kiosk
And right now this kiosk thing is very limited
Question from Robert M. in Chat
And I don't know if you know this because it involves Apple
But didn't Universal pull their videos from iTunes at one point?
I think they did because I soon remember like Heroes
And the NBC shows
But I think that was more of an NBC thing
And NBC and Universal are in cahoots
So I think, I don't know if it's necessarily related to the red box thing
I think it was always a money thing
Right?
Other great comments from chat, thank you chatters
Breslull, no
This was the same thing as Blockbuster renting games
And Nintendo got all pissy back in the late 80s, early 90s
Acidic Vampire
It's a great thing because people will still buy the game
If they like it, especially gamers
DJ Rama S
This could force the gaming industry to lower the price of the PlayStation 3
360 games
ActDeft, sounds interesting but I really don't know if it'll work or not
XLink
It can be a pro because you can try to see if you want to buy the game
Yeah, I mean I get that
I see the pro for us
I don't know if I see the pro for the developers
You know what I'm surprised hasn't happened yet
GameStop doing rentals
I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet
Who knows
Son of Dad
It might bring down game prices for retail as a whole
I would buy a used game from a red box for 25 bucks
If it was available
Superdude in chat says
Wouldn't it be great if you could just stream new releases games
Like you do with Netflix on Xbox Live
I bet you something like that is coming
There's those rumors going around that the PSP 2
Or whatever they're going to call it
New PSP is going to not have a UMD slot
I think we had a story on that a couple weeks ago
Imagine if you could only download games
I don't use my UMD slot
Well
It's a little different for you
But you know what I'm saying
You kind of are seeing this shift towards digital distribution
I think there was a lot of
I seem to remember
We've been doing this show long enough now
I seem to remember in the last generation
When it was new and all this stuff was new
When we first started our show
There was talk that this round of systems
We're in now
Was going to be all digital distribution
And certainly with things like Xbox Live Arcade
PlayStation Network
There's a gigantic foot in the door
But we haven't seen a complete shift to that yet
But the games on Xbox Live are getting bigger and bigger
You know they got rid of those limits on Xbox Live
That Watchmen game is what
Like a gig or something
I mean that's the size of a DVD
I don't know
You know
I would think maybe something like that is coming
Where you could stream games like that
But I don't think it's going to be
The retail games
It's going to be a long time before you see the retail games
Buy into that
But certainly
Digital distribution has games all its own
Sony's on board with it
They're doing their first party games
Available for PSP as digital downloads
At the same time as release
And they've kind of
Tested the waters a little bit with Gran Turismo 5
Prologue, Warhawk
You know, Burnout Paradise
So
If they can find a way that
People would be interested
In purchasing these games
Heck a lot of Xbox Live Arcade games
I could see that you know
They could have released them as a disc version
But they decided not to
And they just released it as an Xbox Live Arcade title
And it's still done very well
I'm not surprised
Alright, we're going to move on to another story
But if you want to give your comments on this
Mailbag at orangelauncherator.com
Send us an email especially
I really want to hear from
And I know we have a few that listen to this show
I want to hear from the people that work for the developers and publishers
What do you think about these boxes?
What do you see as the impact to your business?
I want to kind of hear from those guys
If you need to stay anonymous for whatever reason
Then put it in your email
We'll be happy to stay anonymous
I want to hear from that side of things
Because I don't think we have anybody
In the chat tonight
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about
Maybe games that you might rant through these kiosks someday
Arc System Works
They are the folks that put together Guilty Gear
They are doing a new high def 2D fighter
The game is called Blaze Blue
I don't know how exactly you pronounce that
It's Blaze Blue I would imagine
It's coming out on the Xbox 360
And the Playstation 3
Right now the game is out in Japanese arcades
It's coming out to home consoles over in Japan
And it's going to be coming out on the Xbox 360
And PS3 as well
Apparently over the Japanese arcade release
In the console versions there will now be a story mode
Some individual stories for each character
And so on
30 hours of gameplay according to the director Toshimichi Mori
Also there's going to be
Of course online support
Which you can expect in this current generation of games
And download content as well
Although they haven't said is that just going to be outfits
New characters, moves, backgrounds
Whatever
Kind of interesting especially if you're into
Those Japanese fighting games
I know there's a few sprinkled throughout the country
Those Japanese style arcades where you can go play those machines
I'm sure for fighting games
Fans there's a few of this
But it's interesting now that you're starting to hear
A little bit about a resurgence of 2D fighters
I wonder if Street Fighter 4 is to thank for any of that
Although I imagine something like this
Had to be in development
For a long long time
Shadow Charlie in chat says
Yeah I played Blaze Blue in Chinatown
What'd you think? I'm curious
I had not heard of this game before tonight
Seeing that news bit
They showed it off a while ago
It looks pretty sweet
It's all hand drawn
100,000 animations per character
Nice
Dan Shadow I agree with his comment in chat
When are we going to have a new Marvel vs Capcom
That's the one I'd like to see
Or Capcom vs SNK
Would be the one I'd really like to see
A few weeks ago on the show about how Street Fighter 4
Feels a little bit like there's a slight SNK influence
Like Crimson Viper
Totally feels like she's lifted out of an SNK
But anyhow
Go listen to a previous show
If you want to listen to that
Other 2D fighter news Dark Sakura
Well we have
Actually it's funny you mentioned SNK
We actually have news
On King of Fighters 12
How long has it been out?
12 years maybe
Lucky guess
Well it's actually the
First HD version
That's going to be on
From SNK Playmore
It's supposed to be on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3
It has 20 playable characters
And they're all
Freshly redrawn
And the backgrounds are all new and pretty
And
Supposed to really kick a bunch of ass
There's supposed to be preview footage
And images
Included with the PS2 release of
King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match
Let us know if you see them
My's in it right?
That's all I want to know
Well of course we already heard boobs
Alright me bouncy
That's all I need
Anyways
So
Interesting
Of course there's a lot of
Piracy and flashcard developers
On
The DS and one of those would be
The Cyclo DS or
The CycloWiz which is the flash
Not flashcard but the modchip I have on my Wii actually
They have developed
A new
Program or update to their
Program that bypasses
The anti-piracy
Features in a lot of these games
And apparently now works on all the current games
That feature some sort of anti-piracy
Lockout
Yeah
There's no way to spin that
That's only for piracy
So I guess
If you're interested in pirating games
The Cyclo DS is the way to go
For now
But interesting though
Is this something we should really be encouraging?
No
But it's one of those things that you know
One reason I like to report on this on the show
Is I know we all do is
It's out there
So you can't deny its existence
So it's kind of interesting to see what
That scene does to always compensate for what
The developers of the systems do and back and forth
Yeah
Alright
Talking a little bit
About Metal Gear Online
Kind of moving over a little bit
It's a new expansion coming out on St.
Patrick's Day March 17th
It's Metal Gear Online scene expansion
Three brand new maps
Coming to the game
Two new characters are going to be coming as well
Raiden and Vamp apparently are the new characters
That you're going to see in the Metal Gear Online
Also some new special gear
Which I think is kind of funny because now you can
Apparently wear a bikini if you want
Or you can dress yourself up in clown face or whatever
Or you can wear the head of
Robbie the Rabbit if you want to be extra creepy
That would be from Silent Hill
So there you go
Or if you just want to encourage people to shoot you I don't know
Also there's going to be a brand new game type
Of Metal Gear Online
It's free if you get the pack or not
It's solo capture
It's just like team capture
But you know you're by yourself
Because it's solo capture
This expansion will cost you $9.99
If you want to get all the costumes and the characters
And all that stuff
Yep there you go
Pre-order start on the 10th
And there's some screenshots floating around the internet there
Some other items
You can get a visor for Raiden
Etc, etc
I don't know anyone that plays Metal Gear Online
But I bet it has a pretty rabid community
Because I can't think of many games like it
So there you go
Alright let's move on with some more gaming news
Well I would say this also doubles as pet news
Well I would say this also doubles as pet news
Um, Etsy
Which is a site that has all kinds of sellers
That sell cute hand crafts
And clothes and stuff like that
There is um
A series of
Cat toys
Um, they look like controllers
They have one that's a um
Guitar Hero controller
They have a Wiimote
Um, a Gameboy
An old school Gameboy
Like the brick
They have a 360 controller
And a uh
NES controller
And they look like they're made out of felt
And they are for the kitties
They're so cute
I was gonna say and above all
They're just cute
Adorable for little kitties
I have to show this picture to the chat room
Uh, might Shermie be getting one of these?
No
She don't play with any of the shit I buy her
You know what she plays with?
She plays with twist ties
Nice
How about your kitty, Loki?
I know you got a kitty a couple years ago
Is this something that my cat would play with?
No, she'd probably look at it and go
Does she still play with like that stick?
Uh
Oh, like the feather and stuff?
Yeah, she loves the feather
No, her thing right now, what she's been doing
Um, she likes it when we make her tents
Or like little forts on the couch
Like every time we go to bed now
We build her a fort
Using the blankets on the couch
And she loves that
She's really easy to
Um, entertain
She likes the milk rings
You know, the little rings on the uh, milk cartons
Shermie likes those too
Yeah, she has like 90 of them in the house
And there's like, she dumps them all in her food
And water for some reason, I'm not sure why
But
I don't know
She's making tea, making plastic tea
I guess
I always say Shermie puts her food in her water bowl
Because she wants tea, or gravy
I want a kitty, I don't have any cute kitty stories like you guys do
I want a kitty
The roommate doesn't want a kitty though, so I'll have to wait
But, someday
Oh well
Um, now
Not necessarily something for Kat
But um, the Playstation Network
Um, Sony is I guess
Trying to make this more like
The Virtual Console
Now, the rumor is I guess that
They're going to try to
Put more
Non-PS1 titles on the
Playstation Network
No word on exactly
Um
What systems they're talking about
It's got to be arcade games
It's got to be, just through process of elimination
They can't put Nintendo games on there
It would be pointless then to put Sega games on there
Now that they have that collection out
Maybe they could strike a deal for TurboGrafx games
Or something, but I'm thinking arcade games
You know, we have like Mortal Kombat 2 on Playstation Network
Right? So, I'm thinking arcade games
Yeah
Um, yeah basically
They're promising more PS1 titles
And also more pre-PS1
Retro titles
So I'm guessing those will be the arcade games
You can't really play
Games like Mortal Kombat
Over the PSP thing, right?
Because I remember Mortal Kombat 2 was one of the first games
That came out on Playstation Network, but you can play it on the PS3
But you can't play that on the PSP, can you?
It doesn't have that whole functionality, does it?
You can't play like multiplayer over
Wi-Fi or anything like that
The emulator that it uses to run those
Doesn't work that way
Yeah, any Playstation 1 games
That are on the PS3
Can be played on the PSP
I don't know if Mortal Kombat 2 counts, though
I'm talking specifically that one
That might have been an Xbox
Like a Playstation Network game
So that might not work
But if it's a PS1 classic title
Then yes, that can be ported over
If I would get a memory card for my PSP
I could play sweet code on the go
But anyhow
Going on to a completely different note here
This story has to do
With censorship
Who doesn't love censorship, right?
Although, I don't know if you could
Directly say it's like censorship
But apparently, over in New Zealand
There's a guy
That wants to actually
I guess
Jail adults who allow their kids
To play video games that are violent
Yeah, this is according to
Chief Censor Bill Hastings
From New Zealand
You might think the offense is silly
But it ain't
Apparently, if you were to, let's say, let your kid
Play a violent video game
Shoot him up, blow some hookers in Grand Theft Auto
Whatever
Apparently, if you were the parent
You let your kid play this game
You could face up to three months in prison
Or a $10,000 fine
This law is set up to send a message
How about
Just let people raise their children?
The way they want
To read something like that, I'm like
A big brother is watching you, how are they gonna catch you?
Are they gonna be watching me in my house
Or rely on people, tattling on other people?
This doesn't make sense at all
Dan and I had a conversation about this earlier today, actually
Really?
That we actually wouldn't mind if our kids play violent games
As long as, you know, we balanced it
And had, you know, talks to them
And everything
We're actually going to do it
Intelligently
There's no way
You can just
Shield and shelter them all the time
Or else they don't grow up to be balanced
Individuals
You know
GS68 in chat says
Parents, not government, should be in charge of what their kids play
I think a very well-rounded statement
Interesting though
So you would probably let your kids play
Violent video games, I don't know
I'd probably play it with them
Well no, I would play it with them
In the right context
I think it would be alright
I'm trying to think about myself
Maybe someday I'll have a kid somehow or whatever
But I don't know if
Part of me says
If you don't let them play it
They're going to find a way to do it
And you're right, if you're not the one playing it with them
Then they might not get it in the right context
If that makes sense
Well on top of that, and this goes true for just about anybody
Child, adult, whatever
The things that people are not allowed to do
Tend to be the things
That they want to do just because they're not allowed to
Do you know what I mean?
Like for
I'll use this as an example
There's a method of eating called the intuitive diet
Where you don't
Disallow yourself anything to eat
Because that increases your craving for it
Because you're fixated on finding everything but that
But meanwhile the thing that you want is fixated
But you can't have it
But you really want it
So when you do have it, you just go all out
Well, you know, the same
The sort of logic
Applies to just about anything that people are told they can't do
Like, okay
For example
Let's actually use the recent
Prop 8 crap
People are told they can't do something, what happens?
People come out and force and protest it, right?
And people
They get it done
While they can't or find other ways to get it done
That's what I'm saying is that
It's there, you know what I mean?
Whenever someone says you can't do something
That's a very big part of human nature
That indignation that someone has
The audacity to tell you you can't do something
You know?
Ever since we were little kids, don't you agree, Rob?
Oh yeah, I mean, you know, and it's funny
Because, you know, sometimes for laughs I'll go read
You know, specifically you're talking about Prop 8
Which obviously is an issue I'm quite passionate about
If you don't know why, you know, you need to listen to the show more
But here's the thing
Is that I'll sometimes follow it on one of the local news sites
Where people can comment on it
A lot of comments I see are
They report on this issue too much
It seems like every day you're reporting on some protest
That's because people are not going to shut up
About this, ever
You take away people's rights
They're not going to be happy about it
We're not going to shut up
Until it's equal
But my point was
I know, I'm sorry, I got on a tangent
But no, that actually has to go with what I was saying
Is that you tell people they can't do something
And that's going to rise up indignation
You know, people
Don't want to be controlled
People don't want to be told no
People, you know
And the reason why I'm comparing
Something as strong as a civil rights movement
To something as arbitrary as food
You know
Is that it all comes from the same
The same sort of
You know, even if you may not consciously recognize it
It all comes from
Someone's telling me no
I don't want to be told no
I can have this if I want to
It's a necessity
You know what I mean
And I think that's why
People have a problem with
Bad language because we're taught
That it's bad and that we shouldn't say it
So what do you think
The first thing that people learn in other languages
Is curse words
Don't be gay Sparky, don't be gay
Or
You know, why do you think little kids
Think it's so awesome to go and sneak around
And do stuff behind their parents' back
Because they know their parents are gonna make a big deal
Out of it, it's part of its attention too
Or, you know, why is it that people
Get, you know
Let's rate this very R, why do people get turned on
Doing it in places that they know they're not supposed to
Seriously
Like the couple who was doing the
Whoa
No, for real, there was a contest that was going around
About, you know, who could do it
In what area, and there were points you'd get
For touching
Oh, wasn't that a big radio contest?
That was the thing that got them kicked off the air, right
Where they had sex in a church or something
Yeah, yeah, I remember that
But why would it be such a big deal if they weren't allowed
Because you're not supposed to have sex in a house of God
Exactly
When you're yelling, oh God, oh God, that's not praying
So, really
Where would the allure be
Of the kid sneaking around behind his parents' back
If there's no harm in it
If the parents are gonna be like
Okay
Do you see what my logic is?
No, I get it
I'm gonna be like that with my kid
It's not that I'm gonna
I'm going to teach them the right and wrong
But video games are video games
My whole plan is to teach them the difference between
Reality and unreality
And I also don't care if they curse
Alright, obviously
This is soliciting a huge
Response from chat
I wanna read some of the chat comments we have here
Game Guru says
I'll allow my kid to play any game
If it's rated for older people
Superdude says no flower for my kids
Can't play a game
As tame as flower
SSJ100Matt says
Jamie will teach your kids to play pinball
Hell fuck yeah
AcidicVampire says
And all the lyrics to Pinball Wizard
AcidicVampire says Jamie wants to play manhunt with her kids
No, I wanna play good games with my kids
GS68 says
If your kids can differentiate between reality and fantasy
At an early age, by all means, let them play
Game Guru says
Government is full of idiots
And I don't want idiots to raise kids
DeakMan
Has an interesting plan in chat
Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com
Live on Sunday night says
When my girl gets older
I plan on setting up an NES in her room
And only letting her play NES games for two months
Then SNES for two months
And so on
So she gets an appreciation for classics
Maybe
Maybe I also have this expectation
That my child will be like me and my husband were
And not be stupid
Because I've watched all kinds of crap
And played all kinds of crap
And as long as I
As long as the difference was
I don't think a five year old should play Silent Hill
Right
But what five year old is gonna be interested
In Silent Hill
Right
But like, you know, when I was
For example, I don't look at it any different
As me being allowed to read
The books I was allowed to read as a child
You know
The Scarlet Letter had to do
With, you know
A woman conceiving an
Illegitimate child by having an affair
How old were we when we read this?
You know
How about the Grapes of Wrath dealing with
You know, the depression
That's certainly an adult theme
I read Atlas Shrugged when I was in ninth grade
You know, that actually
Deals with a lot of sex
Catcher in the Rye is like the quintessential
Sophomore year of high school book
Right? I never read it
A lot of kids around here
I read The Odyssey
When I was in middle school
I read The Inferno when I was in middle school
Alright
But I look at it
It's gotta be down to the parent's
Judgment. I look at it the same way
And yeah, they're classic books
Whatever people
Situations dealt with are
For a different level
Of intellect and maturity
And certainly, if I don't detect
The level of maturity that I think is gonna
Be able to handle that
Then, I'm, you know, I'm not
Going to be the one to introduce it to them
You know what I mean?
If it comes out that, yeah
I was at my friend's house and I saw
This thing, then I'll be like, okay
Well, let's have a talk. You know, that's not real
Right? Okay, don't do that
Let's get some chat comments. This is a great discussion
Breslull says, Jamie read Playboy
Too. I don't know about that
For the articles, though, right?
Bochikawa in chat says, Catcher in the Rye is like 6th grade now
They grow up so fast
Dan Shadow says, you know with all these rainbows
And unicorns, 5 year olds will really be into
Diablo 3
Possibly
Alright, some more serious comments in chat
Deathwishing says, I personally think it's good
To show kids M-rated games
Because it shows like Grand Theft Auto
Because it shows them that if they do something wrong
They get fucked by the police
I don't know about that
And what people are taking out of context
There was an XD after that
So I think there was a little tongue in cheek
But I also think that what some people are taking out of context
Is that I'm not gonna take
A 5 year old, like I said
And play Silent Hill with them
It's a lot of it is parents
Discretion
And, you know, like when
When my little sister, okay
My little sister was little, little
We played video games with her
You know, to those days it was
Nintendo and Super Nintendo, but we sat down
And played with her
And, you know, she knew what was real
And what wasn't, like she knew that if she
Sat on a sewer pipe, she likely wouldn't go into
A cavern with gold coins
You know
There's
There's a difference, you know, you just have to
Trust sometimes that
The kids are smarter than you give them credit for
And I actually had this discussion
With Dan's stepmother
And I'm not gonna go into too detailed, but I was like
We can't expect the government to do
A parent's job for them
The parent's responsibility
Is to that child until they are
Of age and can leave
From
A person is a parent before
Conception
That's how I see it
A couple last comments from chat here
And then we'll try to go ahead and move on for tonight
We're having a good discussion, and I'm sure we'll probably get some emails
About this one, can't wait
Superdude in chat says, if kids can get their hands
Into R-rated movies, it's not that hard
For them to get the M-rated games either
Kids will always find a way to get the M-rated games
Because they know M-rated games are the shit
Deathwishing in chat
Last comment here I'm gonna read
I play video games and I haven't killed anything except
Ants, fucking ants
There you go
Alright, if you want to join in
On our chat sometime
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com
Live here on a Sunday night
But for right now, obviously this oversensorship
I have to agree with Marissa
What did she say?
When I was 12 I found my mom's
College level human sexuality book
Only damage it did was give me some very happy
Boyfriends later in life
Alright
Look, we gotta make some time here since
We did just read about a really ludicrous
Story, obviously these types of stories
Put us into a fit of rage
This is the part of the show that we like to call
The FUs of the Week
My first FU goes to people
Making assumptions
This is
Directed
Towards certain people
In my house
Who
Will not
Name names
And also
I'd actually have to direct that towards
Myself too because I've made a couple of
Assumptions too
My second
I was about to say my second assumption
My second FU
Actually has to do
With semis trying to do
U-turns and intersections
Too small for them
And my third one
Has to do with
The Watchmen movie
It should have been a fucking miniseries, not a movie
That means I didn't like it
I just meant the story
Would have been better told through a miniseries
You just wanted more of it
I wanted it better paced
I'll put it that way
It needed better pacing
Alright, I don't really have a lot of FUs
I guess FU to Daylight Savings Time
Does that really screw it up my weekend
Otherwise, just an FU to the fact
That I'm flying to Washington DC this
Week and I'm only going to be there for a day
I'm flying there on Tuesday
I'm going to be there Wednesday, I'm flying back on Thursday
So FU to not getting to spend quality time
In a far away town
FU to Couple Stones because they suck to walk on
They're round and awkward
Round and awkward
Fair enough
That's going to do it for the FUs of the Week
Segment we've done for the past
Many, many years here on Orange Lounge Radio
Let's get back into some gaming news
We do have the mailbag coming up and the Skype line
Soon enough as well where we'll be taking your calls
1877 Game OLR
But not just yet, we'll let you know when the phones are open
We do still have some more stories we want to get to before then
Right, Jamie?
Yes, and this one's about Penny Arcade
Washington State has passed a bill
Which is pretty much like Damn You Guys Rock
To the Penny Arcade founders
Jerry Hulkins and Mike Krahulik
Is that how it's pronounced?
But basically they were honored for their contribution
To their state's industry
Because there are about
48 video game companies
In Washington
And also they run
A really, really excellent
Charity, the Child's Play
Which has raised over 4.5 million dollars
For children's hospitals
So very good
And they also bring people to the state
Like Penny Arcade Expo does
Yeah, and just obviously
Yeah, Penny Arcade Expo is probably a huge
Economy boost for the state
Especially for the restaurants
And the bars
They're very happy about that
Well, you may remember me talking about
Eat, Lead, The Return of Matt Hazard
A game that came out
A couple weeks ago, actually last week
And kind of
Was a parody on the old
Video game genre
Everything from old
Shareware games
You know, RPGs and that kind of stuff
Well now, they have a
New Flash game that you can try out
That actually recreates one of these
Fictional games in
The history of Matt Hazard
And the game of course
Is Matt Hazard
In Land Extreme
Alpha Advance
And it's a
Game you can check out at
MattHazardExtreme.com
Kind of a parody of a 16-bit
Game
And they have a nice photo of Matt Hazard
Destroying what looks like a robotic
Pegasus
Huh
You know, Dan Shadow in chat says
Matt Hazard is not good, quite simply
Um
Were you a fan of Eat, Lead, eventually?
I know a couple weeks ago we were playing it
It was okay, it wasn't great
The game itself is funny, but the way it
Plays is kinda crap
So it's just, it's not
I don't know, it was like
A good idea on paper and then they tried to
Make it and it just wasn't working
It didn't work
Well, one game that's worked for some people, I know this game
Has their fans, I'm gonna be honest, I've never played this game
But Eve Online does have a very
Rabid fan base, I know we have a couple callers that play this game
Um, online, hey guess what?
There is an expansion coming out, I'm sure the fans
Of the game must know this, it's Eve Online
And I'm probably gonna butcher the name
Of this, but it's Apokripa
Apokripa? I don't know how exactly
You say that, Apokripa
Apokripa, I don't know how you say that
But that is the expansion that's
Coming out this week, and apparently
It's gonna kinda change some things about the game
If you're a new player in the game
You get some new epic mission arcs that are
Gonna help guide you through the different factions
In the Eve Online game, and so this means it's gonna be
A little more new player friendly, probably to
Address some of those things that Eve Online is too damn
Difficult, or I've heard a lot of people have gotten into
This game and they get blown away because I guess the whole thing
Is PVP, so this will kinda help
But if you're a veteran player and you wanna get into
This game, there will be some new wormholes
That are gonna show up in the game
And you'll get some new enemies and some new items
And things of that nature
The enemies will now change their tactics
Based on your performance
They might even call in backup, change
Some targets, use debuffs
Whatever they're gonna have to do to
Blow you up
So check out that Eve Online expansion
For Apokripa
A-P-O-C-R-Y-P-H-A
Apokripa
Apokripa, that sounds right, Apokripa
There you go
Uh, Eve Online coming out soon
Coming up right now, the Orange Lounge Radio
Mailbag, every week you guys send us your emails
At mailbag.orangeloungeradio.com
We pick a few of our favorites and read them live
Here on the show, so DarkSakura
Why don't you dive into the mailbag
Mailbag.orangeloungeradio.com
Pick out some emails and reinforce us
Right now
Well, do I gotta?
Yes you do
First email is
Hello to everyone
At the Orange Lounge, including random guests
If there is one this week
That would just be Harvey, who is invisible
Or Pikachu, if you're watching Justin TV
We do have Pikachu and he's armed with a sword tonight
Which Loki's kind of sitting in front of us
He can't really see, but he does have a sword
That's Pimp and Pikachu
That's right, with his pimp hat tonight
The other week you were talking about British tele
It wasn't worth watching on the BBC
If you can access the BBC iPlayer
Please, please, please make some time to watch
A phenomenal new series called Being Human
It's about a vampire, werewolf, and a ghost
That share a house in Bristol
It really is the best thing on TV at the moment
It was Master Chef
But that's finished now
I would love to know your thoughts
I feel like I should inject something
Game related here, so here's my gaming week
Slash month
COD World at War on the Wii
Tony the Tiger says it's great
Not sure if Tony the Tiger owns a Wii though
I'm going now, bye, love from Chard
Age 23 and a half
No wait, I'm nearly 33, fuck
Where did that come from?
That is what the email said, by the way
Which was beautiful
Wow, the next one's big
Thank you spazzinator
Hi folks, if you three didn't mind
I have a few questions for you
First of all, as of right now
I'm trying to change up
How my 360 Elite is hooked up to my TV
Mainly for convenience sake
More than anything
However, I'm running into issues
Right now it's hooked up to my 32 inch
1080i HD TV via component cables
That like to be hooked up by HDMI
And passing through an HDMI switch
On its way to my TV
As nearly as I can tell, it should be a no brainer
All this
All this seating seems correct
And it's just a matter of swapping cables
However, every time I do attempt to switch my TV
It tells me it's receiving an invalid signal
I read the 360's instructions
And it seems like I'm doing everything right
Am I overlooking something obvious here
Before you say it, I know I won't see an improvement
In picture, I'd just like to
Like the convenience of using my
HDMI switch to switch
Between my cable box PS3 and PS3
Um, you said PS3 twice
Anyone care to tackle that?
I ran out for just a minute
That was the heart of the question
Because I wanted to get a refill on my coffee
Something about not getting the right picture?
He wants to hook up his Xbox 360
Elite through the HDMI switch
But it's getting an invalid signal
Um
Hmm
I'm not sure, this might be a question
Better left for a Best Buy employee
Do you have any thoughts, Loki?
I'm not sure, it's okay
You should just hook it up and it should work
Yeah, it should just kind of work
It should be via component cables
But I want it to be hooked up by HDMI
But it should be a no brainer
Yeah, it should be a no brainer
Every time I do attempt it, my switch TV says I'm getting an invalid signal
Try new cables
Yeah, it's gotta be the switch, the cable
Something weird's going on there
You're right, it should be a no brainer
It ought to just work
Should just be able to plug it in and go
Um, some thoughts from our chat room
Because of course when we can't think of the answer
Usually our chatters can
Because Microsoft wants you to buy a new cable
AcidicVampire says you might have to use a
Microsoft HDMI cable
Nah, it doesn't matter, it's just an HDMI cable
But it sounds like, I don't know, some issue
If you've got cheap cables though
Then that might be the problem
We actually pretty much use them
I think we pretty much stick with the monster cables at my house
Monsters, crap
But just any HDMI cable
Maybe that one doesn't
I don't know if you've used that HDMI cable on anything else
Maybe I've had issues
It might be just poor shielded or something
For some reason it's getting the wrong signal
To it
There's another thing you can do
Maybe with it hooked up
Where you can reset the
Your video settings
On it and you might try that
Maybe booting up with the HDMI cable
I think you hold
I want to say it's either the right shoulder button
Or the right trigger and why
While you're booting up the system
I'm sure if you look on Game Facts or something like that
One of them will reset the video
The other will format your hard drive
No, one will not format your hard drive
That's something different
That's a reset
There's another one to reset your cache also
Yeah, I think it's
The shoulder button or the right trigger
It's one of those and why
Oh, is the little thing on the
Oh no, it doesn't, nevermind
I'm thinking the little switch on the back of the core
And it's also important that you have to turn on your console
With your controller if you do that
But
I don't know why that would affect anything
But maybe you could try that and see if that works
Other thoughts from our chat
Again, thank you guys very much
SSJ100Matt suggested he update it
Because they just updated the HDMI on Xbox Live
AcidicVampire says
I tried a generic cable and it didn't work
But it works on my Playstation 3
Dan Shadow says don't buy monsters
SSJ100Matt says I got an HDMI cable
For less than a dollar and it works great
Tony Tony Tony suggests
HDMI input
Cablewholesale.com, that's a good place
To check for cables on HDMI
I think this might be the best advice yet
TigerClaw suggests maybe it's a handshake issue
The HDMI switch must support
HDCP
So maybe the switch is not
Good enough, that's a good thought
And then lastly
Another thing to test, SSJ100Matt says
Try plugging the HDMI cable directly into the TV
And then a recruit
Who has not changed their name
They need to make sure their 360 is configured correctly
So wow, that's like a million different options
Hope it works out for you buddy
Let us know what happens
Next part
In regards to last week's story about the lesbian
That got banned from Xbox Live after reporting being
Harassed by others
I have a bit of an odd nagging question which honestly
I'm surprised no one else has asked
Not to suggest in any way shape or form
That Microsoft or the bullies were right
They obviously weren't by a long shot
But what exactly is the point of
One's orientation on one's online profile
On either Xbox Live or PSN
Granted, I'm still fairly
New to the whole Xbox Live scene and all
But as nearly as I can tell the bio section
Of Xbox Live profile is geared
To inputting info about yourself
That's gaming or gamer lifestyle related
Such as what systems you
Own, what game genre
Players
How long one has been gaming, etc
I don't see how one's orientation
Regardless of what it is has anything to do with gaming
True
As I stated on the show last year
The one where there was a talk about the so called offensive
Retooling of space invaders for the art
commentary purposes
I'm all for the first amendment rights
Regardless of whether or not others are offended
But somehow talk of one's orientation
On Xbox Live seems a bit out of place
Although it's not perfect
The only analogy that comes to mind
At the moment would be like
Going to an AA meeting and talking about all things
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
With the analogy AA meetings are for dealing
With alcoholic issues not TMNT
And as nearly as I figure
Bios on Xbox Live profile are meant to be gaming
Related
Am I missing something here? Am I way
Off the mark or missing the point here?
I do hope that she
Gets her profile back and that she's not turned off
From online gaming
Frankly even though there are A holes
Online gaming on Xbox Live or PSN
Can be a lot of fun
I kind of get what
It's Spaz who sent the emailer
I kind of get what Spaz is saying here
About the whole like you know why did she
Even need to say it in the first place and you know
I don't get it, you don't get it
I don't think any of us really understand why she has to
Say it but at the same time
If that's what she wants to do
If that's what she wants to put in her profile
Shouldn't she be able to put it?
I mean it's not like she put I like to stab kittens in the face
She's a lesbian
I wonder though if
I love the stab kittens in the face would be
Considered offensive and if that would get banned
You probably would I wouldn't try it
I mean if that's what she really
Wants to put in her profile
Who am I to judge?
Maybe I should create a profile a silver account
Or something like that that says I love the stab kittens
In the face
My profile on Xbox Live says I host a radio show
On the internet called Orange Lounge Radio.com
Oh my god banned
Do you think half the people that punch me in the face
In Street Fighter 4 and just kill me
To the ground do you think they give a shit?
That I'm another person with a podcast on the internet
How many people actually read their profiles?
Welcome to the Fantasy Zone get ready
And do you think
99% of the people that you run into
On Xbox Live know what the fuck that is?
Only the old school gamers
Exactly
You know what it's from
I know what it's from it's from Space Harrier
Not Fantasy Zone common misconception but still
You know what I mean
Oh completely off topic I actually found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone
Congrats
You're a winner
I am
Ponzi scheme in chat says
I listened to the interview on Major Nelson's podcast
Microsoft is being ultra PC with this issue
Of course
Of course they have to be ultra PC with this issue
They don't want to get the pink mafia
Sicked on them which I completely understand
And obviously
I think they realize this situation
Has been blown completely out of
Proportion thank you internet
But it's something that needs to be addressed
So it'll be interesting to see what happens
As a result
Alright ready?
Next email
I'm sorry I have to say this one other comment from Ponzi scheme in chat
I like Olive Garden's never ending pasta
Will I get banned for that?
No but you might get fat
Or diarrhea
Hey OLR crew
I've listened to your show for the past 3 years or so
And I thought it would be nice to give you some thanks
Thank you for helping me get through my customer service job
For entertaining me on long bus rides
And for keeping me sane
Your podcast was the first one I ever listened to
And it's one that I look forward to listening to
Every week
There's another reason why I'm sending this email
You see I am sick and tired of people sending emails
With crappy punctuation, grammar, and spelling
Laziness is no excuse
I thought it would be nice for Dark Sakura to finally get
A well written nearly error free email for once
In addition
Just for the sake of proof of concept
This email is written from my iPod touch with auto correct
Turned off so you see people
It can be done
I love you
Alright I'm stepping off my soapbox
Maybe one day I'll email you with something video game related
But that will have to wait for another day
Midnight skies
This presentation of Grammar Nazi has concluded
We now return you to your Orange Jones radio already in progress
Actually I've found no errors
Congratulations
What do you want a cookie?
Fanfare
Oh god don't make me dig up the soundboard
Oh well you were already doing it
Thank you
Thank you thank you thank you
Midnight skies
And I think it was Sasa that pointed this out to me before
But I tend to read the emails like they're sent to me
Including you know bad grammar run on sentences and all
So you can tell from the fluid way in which this email was read
That it was properly phrased and properly punctuated
That it didn't make my heart hurt
Okay what's the email on his name Midnight Skies
Midnight Skies
Congratulations
You get a cookie
This email is getting saved never delete it or I'll stab a kitten in the face
Alright any more emails
Next
This is an inquiry email
Via orangejonesradio.com
From oh dude we have that cool thing set up don't we
What?
I guess this is through the website
Oh no this is me just going
Okay
It's from Irene
Let's just do the rest of the radio show
That was my tribute to Irene the fart princess
Hey there OLR crew this be Lexo and Yo
Or Leoxon Lao Shen
I think it's Leo Shen that's what I've always said
First of all
First off I'd like to say that OLR has got to be my favorite video game show of all time
That aside
Recently on your show I've heard the constant complaint that industry fighter force Seth
The final boss is a cheap bitch
I'd like to show you all a fighting game boss that is even worse than Seth
Someone with the definition of a cheap bitch in fighting games who has the dreaded SNK boss syndrome times 10
Okay so I need to take a look at this
Oh fuck
I'd like to mention that the boss in Tatsunoko vs Capcom is also a cheap bitch
Yes
We are looking at a video here in studio of a fight from Arcana Heart 2
That's brand new
And I'm trying to, the video is buffering
It's all chick fighting
Well that's not anything new
Alright
Alright so yes I'm looking at this boss fight
Yes we're watching
It's pretty
I mean I can't falter for that
She's way too covered though
At least the one on the left is
So the video is a little bit of a low quality
That's what I was saying, the one on the right
Alright anyway I'm sorry
Exactly that's what I'm saying
That's her bouncy
Alright sorry what's the rest of the email
I'm actually just watching the, oh my god, cheap bitch much
Damn
Okay so
They have a special pink controller that you can get for this
Who cares I want it
I want this game
I think I'm gonna have to get this game
Alright
So anyway, back to the email that was currently in progress
She happens to come from the all girl fighter called Sugoi Arcana Heart 2
Sugoi means wow
Her name is
I think that's what Loki said when he saw those boobies
Her name is Paraslycia
And she just happens to be an elven woman who can summon four elemental spheres to take you down
What makes her so bad you may ask
Well first off she has an auto regen super meter
Some special attacks that when they connect it spells an instant 70% or more off your health depleted
Has a special where she can restore most of her health and you can't really stop her from doing it all too well
And she has a nasty little instant kill ultra move as demonstrated over and over in the video included
She also has a bit jiggle of her breasts when she unleashes her special moves
Although to some people that wouldn't hurt to see when their ass is handed to them
We did notice that emailer
She can be beaten but you need some mad skills to do so
The video shows her on normal mode
I can honestly say that she's just as bad on easier modes
Imagine if Seth was like that OLR
I bet some people would have stopped playing Street Fighter 4 arcade mode altogether if Seth was that tough
Well you know I do have to mention that Seth is sort of like you know wearing just like a thong type thing
I would be fine if she was just wearing just a thong
Let her finish
Well just wanted to show a boss that would make Seth her bitch
Keep up the great work with the show but Seth does gut suck
You're fighting game addicted listener Leoshen
P.S. this message is brought to you by Sugoi Arcana Hearts 2
It's so good you'll slap your mama
And of course I love you mama peace out OLR
That was a pretty funny email
Every other sequel that comes out we should all say Sugoi in front of it
Like wow
Hey guys
Oh sorry I was on the next email
Dan Shadow in chat says well who doesn't have a jiggle in their breast when unleashing their special
I can't be the only one without problem
I think that the next email is from Dan Shadow
Oh well then let's hear it
Hey guys Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is one of my most cherished games
After school my friends and I would go to the local pizza place and just rock that arcade
Every day I hope that a new one will be made
To get to the point what new Marvel fighters do you think should make it into a new game if one was made today
Which characters deserve to get scrapped
I personally hope Dante from Devil May Cry
The Bionic Commando and Bucky as Captain America would be in it
Keep it real guys the cold stone is delicious
I want Deadpool
I want Deadpool in the Dan fighting game
And he has to
Could you imagine Deadpool vs. Dan
That would be funny as fuck because it would be taunting back and forth the whole time
Except Deadpool would pull out a gun
I don't have the comic book knowledge to really answer that question from the Marvel standpoint
But from the Capcom standpoint I agree with the Bionic Commando guy with the arm
That would be pretty hilarious
That's a good suggestion
He was a helper in the first Marvel vs. Capcom
This is who I would see in my dream
From Capcom characters
I would actually totally believe Strider Hiryu in it
But I would actually have a palette swap for Hien
From Strider 2
Also you should totally have
For playable I agree with the new Captain America
I agree we should have
Well I would totally say put Luke Cage in it
How about Arthur from Ghouls and Ghosts
He was a helper and I honestly don't see him doing the fighting type
Unless maybe if he was on a second bard he fought in his underwear
I was just going to say when he gets down to low life his suit gets knocked off
Or he has the gold armor during a power up
I don't know I'm stupid
I want Forte
Or
Bass
Rob from Rockman
Um
I also
I'd actually like to see Ingrid
And I definitely want Sakura in the game
But um
I don't know
You could really there's just so much to choose from
Alright enough fanboy wank
That's it
Alright
Wank wank wank
Speaking of wank I'm sorry that was wang
Today
Oh and the Watchmen movie
Yeah I've heard I've heard
Big blue cock
I think it's all CGI though
Actually I will go ahead and tell everybody this who's going to see the movie
Unless you're like looking at his crotch
The cock is not distracting
Unless you're looking for it
Cock is always distracting I don't know dark Sakura
It glowed with the rest of him so it was kind of hard to see
Alright I'm waiting to see the movie on IMAX
So I can have you know a six story tall cock
That would be
Is that like Disneyland?
It's an IMAX at Eldorado Hills
Is it really?
I know they had IMAX out there
Yeah I know they just added it but um
Yeah it's playing there
Alright
The Irish gangster in chat says
In Soviet Russia cock looks at you
Do you want six story cock?
Uh sure
Do you want to be blue and radioactive?
Yes please
Okay
Alright let's
Let's get one more story and then we're going to open up the skype line to your calls
At 1-877-GAME-OLR
Yeah
So let's see there's some possible announcements that are going to happen
Later this week actually
Supposedly on March 12th
Kind of going along with their whole launch event for Resident Evil 5 in San Francisco
There is some evidence suggesting that they're going to announce a brand new Resident Evil title for the Wii
And that Resident Evil title just might be a port or remake of Resident Evil Code Veronica
And apparently there's been a lot of rumors going around saying you know
Hey if you're a Resident Evil Wii fan we've got some great news for you
And I don't know I mean honestly I didn't think Code Veronica was that great
From what I remember reading as far as reviews go and stuff
I don't know Code Veronica did come out though on the GameCube back in 2003
So maybe they're doing a Resident Evil 4 Wii version type thing for this
I don't know maybe just adding the Wii controls to it
I don't think that would be that exciting if that's what they're doing
But maybe a brand new Code Veronica game who knows
But maybe a brand new Resident Evil game for the Wii
Anything I guess is pretty good
AcidicVampire wonders aloud in our chat room why Veronica why not Resident Evil 2
I don't know
Maybe because you know not that many people had a Dreamcast
But compared to the Wii not that many people had a Dreamcast
And the Rob D in chat says the reviews for the Code Veronica were all pretty good on the Dreamcast
Alright hey if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
We are going to open up the phone lines right now to take your calls
Do we have any last minute stories while we're waiting?
I think we hit out almost everything that was in the show roll thread this week
But I don't know Loki did anything come up last minute tonight or Dark Soccer?
Cock
I waited for you to take a sip I timed it wrong
Yeah I had coffee
I ran in during that last story because I drank two cups of coffee so you know why I had to run in the house
Drop head to tinkle
Yes
I guess like a small thing I guess some of the cars from Burnout are going to be in Godfather 2
Interesting
That doesn't make any sense to me but okay
Alright we got a call on the line
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this?
Breslau how you guys doing?
Breslau damn we haven't heard from you in the show in a long time
You know in chat you never shut up but it's nice to hear your actual voice how have you been?
I don't know what you're talking about
How have you been sir?
I have been well except for my Xbox Red Ringing which is the complete stem of that little rant I wrote on our news page
But before it Red Ringed a mini review of a game that's been out for a while
The Sega Sonic Genesis Mega Collection
Yes
I don't know if you guys have talked about this
We have we lavished fanboy wank upon it a few weeks ago that's my tip of the evening fanboy wank
It's probably the best bang for your buck on the Xbox right now it's almost 50 games for 30 bucks
And you can get a lot of play out of it you get two shining forces four fantasy stars all the Sonics
I mean there's at least 80 hours of gameplay in there
What I didn't really like is you can change the video settings but it's only within each game there's not a global setting
That gets kind of annoying
The games also just like everything else that's happened with you know old ports they don't look good in 720p
No they don't and you know what though I agree maybe a global setting would be nice
But you know the game does remember from game to game how you have it set
So some games look better like with that stretched you know faux 16x9 than others
Other games were not meant to be played in that stretched 16x9
But games like Sonic Spinball actually work really well in the stretched 16x9
Absolutely I agree with that I mean a lot of those Sonic games look good in 16x9
You know the smoothing feature is probably one of the worst things I've seen
But there's two games that actually look good with them and there's Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles
But overall it's 30 bucks go get it
Yeah it's not bad I actually reviewed it on Playstation 3 because when I went to get it they didn't have it on 360
So I just said what the hell it's the same game so I got it on Playstation 3 but you know same same
And it's a great collection
Yeah absolutely and if any of you haven't heard I have to plug the other thing I do besides the USO March Madness
Which the Final Four has been announced blah blah blah
You want to tell us what the Final Four is real quick?
Sure why not the Final Four as of right now are Super Mario Bros. 3 vs. Rock Band
And I know at least one person on the air right now voted Rock Band very protest like
Yes but that was me just because I wanted revenge on Tetris for it beating Super Metroid
But I still believe Rock Band has no business being in the top four games of all time
Mario 3 I can see that I can see that
Well that comes from you know this show's roots as a music game show
Sure I understand that I understand that it's not please I spent like most of my gaming week playing Rock Band
It's not that I dislike Rock Band by any means but it's no Mario 3 it's no Super Metroid
It's no Final Four game and it's no one seed
Maybe in a couple years it needs to age like a wine a little bit
Yeah and then the battle of the Super Nintendo games on the other side of the bracket is Chrono Trigger vs. Link to the Past
Link to the Past almost got beat by Sonic 2 which has been the dark horse of the entire tournament
Yeah it's been very interesting I don't know how Sonic 2 has been doing
Who are the Sonic fans that are voting that game up? Nobody's really professed
I did it a couple rounds but not against Link to the Past not against that
I didn't do it against Ocarina of Time
I still have a hard time accepting that Chrono Trigger beat Final Fantasy 6
But that's my own because I love Final Fantasy 6 but I understand there is so much fanboy wank
For lack of a better term out there for Chrono Trigger especially with the recent release
I can see that but I'm a little disappointed that Final Fantasy 6 didn't pull through
But I guess if it's going to be beat at least it didn't get beat by like DDR or something
If Final Fantasy 6 is going to get beaten by a game at least it was Chrono Trigger
At least I can say okay I understand that
Yeah and it's the same thing along Mario 3 beating DDR finally
But also if you haven't heard and you are in the Pacific Northwest area
The convention that I staff at Sakura Con is going to have Smile DK there
It's their second North American appearance ever
So it's in a month so I think preregistration closes next Sunday
And I think it's $45 for all three days so if you want to go and meet Smile DK
And also we're going to be doing under sedation live on location so
Is Travis going out there for that?
Travis is not but we have an internet connection and there's sure to be a lot of fun involved with that
You know what if the Southwest prices stay low I might just have to consider it
Because my friend can get me a really good discount on rooms and stuff
I might have to consider it press lol
Because especially if you can get us an interview with Smile DK I might really have to do it
Oh dude absolutely
Interesting I don't know I can't speak for the other two but I will always take an excuse to go to Seattle
Absolutely I took an excuse to move here
I don't know but at the same time I've also been promising Chicago for years and years
And I kind of feel like an obligation that if I'm going to do one I kind of need to make ASEN happen
But we'll see
Alrighty well that's it really from here in Seattle so nice hearing from you guys again
Alright thank you as well Bresl and keep writing those articles for the website
Good time
And by the way
He hung up on us little bastard
By the way speaking of articles on the website while we're waiting for another call
At 1877 Game OLR username on Skype Orange Launch Radio
I wanted to plug something on the website real quick
It's an article that was just posted and I thought this was actually a pretty good idea
Something that was posted by Dekeman
Kind of a different contest here for the best Konami games
Because you know Konami's 40th birthday is coming up in a couple weeks
We are going to actually do on OrangeLaunchRadio.com
The top three favorite Konami games is what you post
And then we're going to count down like the top five games in special highlight articles
That's kind of fun
So kind of counting down the top Konami games
Obviously we have a history with Konami here at this station
So I fully expect that BeatMania 2DX will be the number one
How can it not?
With our audience I would be shocked and odd if BeatMania 2DX is not number one
I'll tell you that wouldn't be my number one
I don't know
I'd have to sit down and think long and hard
I really have to look at like a big list of Konami games
I would put some obscure shit in there though
I would tell you that
You know what the top of my list would be Rob?
What's that?
Dracula X
Oh that is Castlevania
Now it's tough
You're on our website www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
Let's go back to the phones because it's been ringing
And I'm sorry guys if I haven't been picking up
But I wanted to get that out there
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
Hey it's Ron what's up everyone?
Not much how you doing Rama?
Good I'm recovering from restoring windows on my computer
But other than that life's been pretty good
Yeah
Good good
What do we owe this phone call to tonight?
Some information that I happened to come across
I meant to discuss the last time I spoke to you guys
Now
As you know Sega was at
Comic Con back in February
It seems
That another video game
Company is looking into going
At the conventions as well
How so?
Well as you guys know
I work for a company where we go to cons
We set up booths and we sell items
Now we're doing
Anime Boston in May
And we just got information about
A couple of weeks ago
About two or three weeks ago
About our location and where we're going to be
It seems that our booth is going to be
You ready for this?
Directly across from Nintendo
Huh
Interesting
Wow okay
So Nintendo is going around the cons
What do you think they're going to be showing off?
Do you think it's just the Wii or what?
I really don't know
I'm thinking either
It's going to be like a booth version of
Nintendo World set up there
Or um
Actually Nintendo will be coming down with kiosks
With the displays that show off
A lot of games
Hmm
Considering the business that you're in
If it's what I think it is, if it's still the same
I think that's very funny that you're going to be directly across from Nintendo actually
Well
Because they kind of screwed us
Over at one convention
They gave us first dibs and when we picked it
We found out afterwards that Nintendo is directly
Across from us so
Everyone at the booth will be doing Nintendo themed
Cosplays
Ha ha, I see, okay
Trying to get some attention, very smart
Well we try
Very smart
Well I expect a full report and pictures
Because sadly Anime Boston, I don't think
Considering I've got two other cons
I'm trying to weigh between, I don't think Anime Boston is going to happen
However
However, PAX East Coast
You know I want to go to that
Well you best be there man
That will be my arrival in Boston
And I have internet friends in that area that I want to go visit anyway
So it works out
So we'll see
Well good luck with that
Any other conventions coming up that we ought to know about are our listeners
Well if you're in
New York, New Jersey, Tri-State area
Coming up we have
Castle Point Anime Convention, Hoboken, New Jersey
And ICON
29 I believe
One of East Coast's biggest
sci-fi conventions
It's sci-fi and medieval arts
Alright
Sci-fi and medieval arts
It reminds me of that whole
Margaret Cho joke about
Why is it that, you know, Star Trek
Always seems to go hand in hand with the Ren Faire
I don't know, sorry
Random thought
I don't know about you but Star Trek can go with
Almost anything, you know
It really can, it really can
I'm gonna get some more calls but thank you so much
Alright, later
There's a lot of you guys hammering the line tonight
I just don't want to try to get to as many calls as I can
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
DS Master 26
Hi DS Master 26, what's on your mind?
Much more game review
For ya, and uh
A few comments and suggestions for the show
Alrighty
Well, um
Cause I'm an F-Zero fan
I mean, who isn't in this house, you know
Love F-Zero, wish they would
Put a new one out on the Wii already, yeah
And just to fill the time
I'm waiting for a friggin' DS version
To come out, I have a PSP here
As you can tell, and so I'm like
You know, it's a lot better to fill it than wipe out
Pure, right?
So, I'm like
Okay
I storied up everything, I have
My friend Gamesafe who had all the classic
Packs and everything, cause I can't tell them
For some weirdo reason, they closed the site
To download stuff from
But uh, it's a little bit more challenging
Than F-Zero, I'll tell you that
It is, I've played the Wipeout
On uh, Playstation Network, I can't remember the
Name of it, I think it's just Wipeout HD
And uh, it's a little harder
Than F-Zero, it's such a different style
Too, F-Zero to me is a little more
Cartoony, but don't take that
Too literally, you know what I mean? Like
F-Zero GX especially, which is one of my favorite
Racing games ever, is not definitely
A cartoony looking game, but Wipeout feels a little
More, I don't know, just a little more
Edgy than F-Zero, but that doesn't
Usually that's a term that means
One's better than the other, not in this case
Yeah, and uh
I don't know, but like
It's so hard to get on your
Channel sometimes, uh
Have you guys ever thought of like, you know, doing
Open mic or conference call
With Skype?
Like AGI and DPL did?
What do you mean like
Just opening it up so that every
Person can come on and chat and stuff?
Perhaps
We like that, yeah
I think the only problem with that is that, you know
We try to cover a lot of ground during the show
And I think if we did that, we would
Just, it would just kind of turn into this giant
You know, cluster of a show
What I would love, I would love to take calls
Throughout the show, but we need like
Somebody to screen the calls in order to be able
To do that to make sure people are gonna stay on topic
Again, so the show can flow
One of the feedback I hear about the show very often is that
It's almost a little too long
So I would just be afraid that if we did kind of just
I mean, we got on enough tangents as it is
If we let it get on even more tangents
I'd just be afraid we'd be here for six hours
Which, you know, I do love this show
But, um
You know, I also love going to bed at a decent hour
So, but you know
That's why we do at least a Skype line, try to get the feedback
And I know not everybody can always get through
We try to do the emails and chat room comments
And we'd like to think, out of all the gaming
Podcasts out there, we're one of the
More interactive ones that are out there
But I know there's other shows doing their thing
But speaking of all games and all that stuff
You know, look forward to
At E3
More of that kind of working together type of stuff
That maybe you saw at Penny Arcade Expo
I don't have anything down in writing for sure yet
But you can definitely see that
There will be some joining of the independent
Podcast to do some stuff
Come E3 this year, I would say that is
Inevitable, and working
With the listeners for listener feedback
I mean, I would love to do
Like live E3 shows
Where the listeners can call in and ask us questions
And all that, but I don't know
If without the E3
What do they call that, E3 Arena this year
I don't know if that's going to be as possible
It's going to be interesting
SSG100, Matt
Go ahead
I also saw an episode of
Sessler's soapbox at Dollar Day
And actually, strange enough
I didn't get it from the
E3, E4 TV side of my PSP
Because, get this, they closed down
The RSS feeds for PSP users
Which kind of sucks
That's why I don't know if there's stuff on here before
But yeah, so I had to
Go off iTunes and everything
I had to convert, it's crud
But the topic
I'm sorry, I don't understand why
You'd want to close out one of your
Why would you want to shut the door on your listeners?
I mean, I guess when you're a TV station
And you have that type of money, you can make those types of decisions
But I just think it's crazy talk
To close the door
I mean, maybe it was costing them too much to produce
But how much can it cost
To translate a movie into PSP for
It seems a little silly, a little silly
Yeah, and
Sessler's soapbox was going on
About, you know, kids playing Emory games
And how, you know, it's no different
Than some kid possibly
You know, seeing a radar movie
I mean, heck, when I was
Eleven, I saw The Matrix
And I was, you know
Radar, did I end up
Going sniping people? No
Frickin' Chad Thompson
Who's
Well, thank God, disbarred
Um
Needs to get head screwed on straight
I know, you know,
Unfortunately, these guys
Run with the one bad apple
That ruins it for the rest of us normal people
You know what I mean?
Yeah, because of that, I mean, the only
Way I was able to get my hands on
GTA LCS
Was on Amazon with my debit card
Yes, I have one
I used to have a job
But now I'm dead broke with only
One dollar twenty cents on my account
Don't have enough to pay taxes, I am so screwed
Oh no
Starting to get a little depressing
Alright, well
Is there anything else you wanted to comment on
Before we try to get some more calls?
Um, yeah
You know, I kind of
Listened back to episode 3, 12 and what
Dan said, I went over to Game Shop
And whatever
Like, sorry, we still can't give you a
Replacement or whatever
And so
Basically, I don't know
What else to go at here
Other than spend twenty bucks
On a faceplate and whatever and replace
Next, I think that might be the issue
Yeah, it might be what you're gonna have to
Yeah, unfortunately it might be what you're gonna have to do at this
Point, I mean, I
No, no, I remember
Yeah, I think this was
The same one, but I remember the email a while back
That Dan was responding to
About the, yeah
And it was kind of no guarantee
That it was gonna work, so unfortunately
Yeah, you might just have to try and explore those
Options that are gonna cost a little bit of money
I know you say you don't have no money right now
But, you know, I guess there
Are some more things important than games
Prioritize
Yeah, because I spent
A bunch of money on my
Prom date with my girlfriend who also
Plays Destroy All Humans and says
That's better than GTA because she says
Flying saucers are better than
Pinks, but I don't know
What's your view on that?
Prioritize
Since I've been a prom date
Before, I wouldn't have wanted a whole lot of money
Spent on me if it was at the expense
Of someone being able to pay their bills
But, you know, it's all gonna be worth it
Because we're gonna be watching Twilight
Alright, well anyway, DS Master
We gotta let you go, we gotta get some more calls
Before we end up, but thank you so much for your call
And good luck with the monies
I know it's a tight time for a lot of people right now
But things will work out, they always do
Alright, good luck buddy
Peace out and keep rocking the show
Alright, we'll try, see ya
Alright, we'll probably take like one more call on the
Skypline of 1877 Game OLR
I wanted to read some comments
That were in chat
And now I can't find them, darn it
It was a little while ago
Oh, SSU100Matt says
OLR was the first show to use Skype
I still believe to this day that that is true
That we were, but
Nobody probably believes me, anyway, we got one more call
We'll take it, and then we're gonna wrap up the show
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?
It's Death Wishing
Hi, Death Wishing, what's on your mind?
First, I'd like to say, no more cock jokes
Sure, you got a whole chat storm of cock jokes
And it was very, um
Alright
Unfortunately that happens sometimes
Is that one funny thing is said and the chat just won't let it die
But that's just part of the
It's a revival of the old big black cock
It's, it's, it's not a big black cock
It's charm?
I don't know?
Oh, I forget, what did you call in about tonight?
Um, I would like to comment on the guitar hero
You know, holy crap, there's a lot of them
For real, right?
I mean, did you hear earlier
When we were saying, can you hear the milking of the franchise?
I personally call it
You know the weird 30 year old guy
That stays in his mom's basement
And has an addiction to porn
It's pretty much, he's running out of Vaseline
You better watch it, because I've got two of those three
I'm 30 years old and addicted to porn
But do you live with your mom?
No, I don't, thankfully
Alright
Wait, so what about the guys that live with their mom?
These are the guys that are gonna be buying the games?
No, no, I'm just saying
That's like an example
That's an example of what they're doing to it
My problem is that the guitar hero games
Aren't exactly the same as like Rock Band
Whereas Rock Band, say for example
You know, someone was actually
Doing a comparison with the amount of games
That Rock Band releases, and to be honest
The games that they release, like the track packs
Or whatever, it's just download content
That's available now on disc
It's not something that you necessarily need to buy
It's nothing new, unless you don't have internet
But the guitar hero games
They're all these different new tracks
That you can't dump together
So you have to buy all these games
And each one has to be played separately
And that's retarded
And that's one thing I really like about Rock Band 2 as well
Is that it seems like the developers of Rock Band
Are continuing to add to Rock Band 2
Granted, yeah, you got the ACDC game
But they didn't really bother to promote that that much
It was just kind of a one-off thing
Like, hey, this is out there, you can get this
And then everything is pouring into Rock Band 2
They have all this regular content
And sure, okay, the Beatles game is going to be
A completely separate game
But it's the fucking Beatles, they're allowed
Well, that's the deal that they had
They would have done it as a Rock Band track pack
But the people that have the Beatles license
They're like, uh, no
Which, again, it's the Beatles, they're allowed
There's not a lot of bands I'd say that for
But with Guitar Hero, yeah, I mean, come on
The greatest hits
The sub-par 80s game
Pretty much, if you want greatest hits
Just pick up the
Dish, you'll probably be able to get it cheaper
Well, even the greatest hits isn't so bad
Because they're expanding on it
And that's fine, but
I don't know, it's just
It's all these games
And all these artist-specific games
To me, it sounds very risky
Because not everyone loves Metallica
Not everyone loves Van Halen
Not everyone loves Aerosmith
I mean, so
And the other thing, too, they're all
Well, you know, you get like 40-some tracks
For, you know, 60 bucks or whatever
That's a great deal
I might not want all those tracks
At least with Rock Band, I can pick and choose what I want
And that's why I love Rock Band
You know, yeah, from a gamer standpoint
Right now, I, you know
Somebody who's been playing music
Games for about 10 years now
I definitely prefer Rock Band to Guitar Hero
At this point in time
For these reasons that we've been stating
It's just
A better package to me
And plus, also, consider this
The Guitar Hero on tour, the DS one
Eh, you know, what are they trying to do with that?
DS one gives you carpal tunnel
Yeah, they're trying to condense
The guitar playing experience into the DS
Which just doesn't really work
And honestly, those DS games, they're about
As different with each other as, unfortunately
The guitar-free schemes in their arcades
Trackless update, trackless update
Let's reskin it a little bit, done
But, the Rock Band game that's coming out
For PSP, where they're kind of
Now taking this different approach to it
Where it's gonna be more like frequency or amplitude
If the rumors are to be believed
That sounds awesome!
No stupid peripheral to plug in my PSP
Just making music
And in a way
That's just different from
It sounds great
Dang moment
Here's a thought, this would be kind of cool
Can you imagine if they were to do
A game like that, for say the 360
Or whatever, and the PS3
Kind of like this amplitude Rock Band thing
But, it took all the music that you
Downloaded from Rock Band and allowed you to
Use that
Jizz in my pants
Isn't that pretty much audio surf?
It basically is, sort of
Audio surf is more of just a game that's a rhythm
Stuff, it doesn't add elements
To the music, you don't
Play the drum track and play something else
Yeah, audio surf also
Can kind of be a little hit and miss
If you play a song with a very strong beat
It'll be a lot better than just
It's just like those
DDR games, what was like the Codemasters
Game where you could play any CD
Dance Factory or whatever
A lot of songs in Dance Factory
I've not really heard of that
We know a lot of obscure shit here, but there was a
DDR knock off where you could put in your own CD
And get the arrows generated
And it was very hit and miss, mostly miss
Dude
Alright, well hey, any other
Final thoughts before we get on out of here?
I went to UCLA
And they have two street fighter cabinets
Four cabinets there
At UCLA, really?
Big scene there? Were they busy?
Well, I went there when it was lunch
Because I'm not that old, I'm only 16
I went on a field trip there
And there was like
It was lunch time, there was about
Maybe 10 people
In there, I guess at lunch, you know, some people
Could be in classes or something, but they also had
King of Fighters and Street Fighter 3
You know, and it was just like
They all
It was pretty much like the
All the Asian games you want to play
Since you're in the LA area, have you ever been to an arcade out there
Called Arcade Infinity?
No. It's out in City of
Industry, and actually we've
Back in the day when we were much more into the DDR
And Beatmania, we would drive all the way from Sacramento
Where we're based, to go to this arcade
To play some of the legendary games
There was the Gundam game
That was epic
There were just so many epic games
I haven't been there in a long time, but I imagine they've got
Quite a crowd of people, too, around these fighting games
So, you know, there's definitely an audience
For it, and it's
The only arcades I ever really went to were like
I think the Sega one I knew
Oh, Gameworks?
No, it was all Sega
But then it got turned into Gameworks, I think
Oh, because I knew that Gameworks was a Sega arcade
I think I know what he's talking about
I can't remember
I might have been there once, but anyway
It had this awesome helicopter game where you rolled around
The Sega 360
Was that the Tatsu?
Was that a Sega thing?
That's the Sega 360
It's a lot better than the Tatsu thing
Oh, okay. A little different
But arcades are pretty much dead now
And it's sad, because
All the online gaming
Has really put a dent in it
It's gonna take something epic to bring people back
But who knows? Maybe when the recession
I know a way to bring back arcades
Real quick, what is it?
Boobs
We'll see what happens
Alright, Deathwishing, we gotta let you go to wrap up this show
Good luck on your quest for boobs in arcades
Alright
I'll be a millionaire one day, just watch
Alright, you heard it here first
Alright, take care, buddy
Bye
I think everybody's thought about trying that
Like mixing a strip club with an arcade
With, I don't know, maybe there's local laws
I approve
No, I mean
That's just a strip club with an arcade in it
The problem is, though, is you really want
I mean, they don't want
Arcade games in a strip club
Because one, you have to pay money to get into a strip club
And two, it takes away from the time
That the strippers have with you, so they can't get paid
What if you got a lap dance
While playing, you know, Street Fighter IV
That'd be distracting
Yeah, it would be a little distracting
I tried
Alright, we're gonna take a minute to wrap up the show here
But a strip club with video game themes
That could be dual
Or video games and anime themes
That could be dual
Alright
That sounds like a bad convention
Like a cosplay strip club
But not with nasty looking chicks
It's not like when Consumer Electronics Show is going on
At the same time as the adult video convention
That kind of thing
Remember they just need to combine them into one
Alright, we gotta wrap up the show
Enough silly talk, we need to wrap up the show
We're running a little long tonight, which is fine
We've had a good show, a lot of good discussion tonight
And yeah, it was a good show, good calls, good discussion
Good chat, I'm feeling good about tonight's show
So thank you all for making it a success
Let's get some, I don't think there's any more
Last minute stories, right Loki?
Yeah, there's some Guitar Hero stuff
Coming out this month, including Queen
No, well, download tracks
Including Queen
Oh, well, that is epic
I will promise a story for Queen
Yeah, so there's some interesting songs
Including, I'm trying to think what they were now
As I pull this up
I think Killer Queen was one of them
Which is interesting
And then
Let's see here
It was nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody
Or anything cool like that, unfortunately
Um
Sorry
Let me just pull this up here
Killer Queen
That's interesting, because there was a cover
Of that in Guitar Freaks back in the day
Maybe that was the only
Um
Maybe that was the only Queen song
From the download content
I think there was only one or two, wasn't Bicycle in it?
I don't remember, Fat Bottom Girls or something
I don't know, they need them all
This is interesting, because Queen's
Supposed to be in SingStar too
They had
Yeah, Killer Queen
Which is going to be part of
The Queen Track Pack
We Are the Champions
Actually, no, Killer Queen isn't in that
It's We Are the Champions, Fat Bottom Girls
And Celebrity
And those are all going to be available in the Queen Track Pack
On March 26th
The week before that, they're going to have the Jimi Hendrix
Track Pack with Freedom, Angel, and
Foxy Lady, the live version
Nice, on March 19th
Also available on March 19th would be the European
Track Pack
I'm not sure if these were available in Europe
I'm sure it might be just European bands
With What Have You Done
By Within Temptation
I Are Comet Alex
By Dai Toten Hosen
And Carolina
By MClan
And then finally, available last week
Break It Out by Vanilla Sky
In the Shadows by
Rasmus
And Cies Komesa
By Lesrita
Mitsuko
I don't know, I think I butchered that last name
Mitsuko
Yeah
Alright
Ok, we gotta wrap up, we're gonna get all the closing
thoughts and wrap on out of here for tonight
We are running a little long tonight
Show's very, very long, but that's alright, it was a good show
Dark Sakura, your final thought for us tonight
Happy birthday, Chris
I agree, happy birthday, Chris
How dare I not say anything, I left her message on Facebook
earlier, but you know, just got sidetracked with the show
Yes, happy birthday
Chris, one of the OLR lesbians
My final thought
would be, I
am craving
Pringles
And no, this isn't a G4 show
back in the day, we're all sponsored by Pringles
but I really am craving Pringles, Loki, your final thought
I am not craving
Pringles, Pringles are nasty
Pringles are not nasty, you're nasty
Alright, we're done, we're out of here
