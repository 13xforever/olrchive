Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco Kade

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, March 1, 2009, the R4DS card gets smacked down in Japan

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Cooking Mama is ready to fix it on your iPhone

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Could a remake of Silent Hill be made for the Wii?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I have beef

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
Congratulations, hopefully you don't get equal eye or any of the mad cow disease or anything like that

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
No!

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
You do sound like an angry cow right there

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
How are you?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Beefy

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Alright, say hello

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hello

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Are you feeling beefy as well?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
No

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
How are you feeling?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Cheesy

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Cheesy, alright

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I am feeling hungry

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Sir Robert, are you the buns?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I guess so

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
You're listening to Cheeseburger Radio where you can have all the time

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
I have a cheese pizza because I haven't eaten anything all day long

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
All day long?

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah because I was busy, I woke up early because Nathan had to call me early to go to Fry's

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And we were building a computer all day and I didn't have a chance to stop and eat something

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
So you didn't, you got rained out for your thing once again didn't you?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
And next week and the week after next

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, don't get me started on that

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
It's funny because it'll be clear all fucking week long and then Sunday

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
POUR!

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
You look at the weather next week, it's the same way except it's pouring all week

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And then it has a break and then pouring some more on Sunday

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
At least it's not snowing here, on my Twitter today like all my friends on the east coast are like

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
OMG snow, OMG snow

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
It's snowing in Alabama

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
It's snowing like all over the southeast, what?

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
I have to tell you something else that's really cool, I had cheeseburgers for breakfast too

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
You had cheeseburgers today for breakfast?

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Yes, my leftovers from Denny's last night because we stopped in Denny's on the way home

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
I want to say hello to of course our chatters, the always present fourth guests on the show

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
And we actually have a chatter named Cheeseburger who is very excited saying

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Yay Cheeseburger Radio

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
We also like to broadcast the show on Justin TV which you can see as we're taping live on Sunday nights as well

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Justin.tv.orangeloungeradio

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Although people are supposed to be clipping parts of the show, making clips for us

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Do it!

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So I can put them on YouTube but there's like one clip

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
But I want to show this on Justin TV so I apologize it's going to be a horrible radio

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
But Darkshark talk about the donations you've made to the studio

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Well first of all a little bit of background

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
Dan and I are doing Uber cleaning, this is like spring cleaning for the millennium

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
And we found a bunch of our old posters and wall scrolls and some of them are kind of smashed

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
But I don't think Rob cares about smashed posters on the wall

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
So I decided to donate a number of our posters that we were just going to get rid of

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
It's hard to see on the TV anyway

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
To the wall, not only that wall but the other wall and probably that wall too

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
And the ceiling maybe

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Who knows we might be able to really decorate in here I'm sure our landlords will love that

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
But I wanted to show this one in particular because this is one of the coolest donations I think

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
And a lot of our long time fans are going to get a kick out of this

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
But tell them what I'm opening up right now

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Rob is opening up a DDR second mix marquee

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Which I have had for quite some time

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And that's like an actual like used in a machine type thing

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
And if you put tacks in that thing I will shoot you

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Alright then I can't put tacks in it

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
You can use sticky tacks

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
I'll figure something out but look at that there's even an official Konami seal there in the corner

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
That shows you it's the real deal

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
It means nothing

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
That one is though

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I don't think they really pirated second mix though

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
No that one actually is a legit second mix marquee

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
So it's my baby it was going to go in the vault but now the vault is completely empty

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
I have the metal thing from the machine I don't remember the face plate or whatever

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I never did use that for anything

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
But it's around somewhere

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Bring it on over we'll put it in studio

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
But what would the listeners be most excited about that you're planning to do with some of your stuff

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Dark Sakura?

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
Well I don't know yet it's not really official Rob

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Oh sorry then I won't say anything else

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Well I'll say something

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Burn it on air

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Yes we're going to burn some of it live on air

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Well as I'm sure our listeners know Dan and I have a whole lot of shit

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
A lot of stuff really

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
And because we're going to be thinning out the collection some of it

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm thinking that some of the neater things that we just won't be able to eBay or anything

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I might make a big grab bag for who wants my shit

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
So if anyone is interested in that then quick quick vote in the chat room

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Wire in or fire

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Who wants my shit?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I hope fire wins

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
And like I'm talking like leftover stuff like Hello Kitty stationary from six years ago

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Awesome

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And Rudoni Kenshin stationary from eight years ago

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Who wants Jamie's crap?

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
And like leftover wall scrolls and shit

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
I see a lot of Y's popping up in chat people want your shit

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
God you want my crap

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Act deft I want your shit

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Like old E3 swag you know just crap

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
The DJ Ronma S wants to know where's the whiteboard

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
The whiteboard is here it's down for repairs before we remodel the studio

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I used it for a side project on Thursday and I need to clean it up

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Rob used it for Big Brother

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I did I used it for the Big Brother game

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I was just guessing that's great

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
I actually did on my own personal JTV I don't know if I want to give out the link

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I'll put it out in chat or something but on my own personal JTV channel

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
You can see the whiteboard being used earlier this week

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
There you go

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
For my online reality game addiction

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Alright let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Actually we're going to start a little different tonight with How Was Your Gaming Week

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
We're going to do something a little different

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I'm going to start because I can

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
But I want to talk about something that actually was both Dark Soccer and myself

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We went to Video Games Live last night

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Very unexpected

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Kind of came up last minute that a friend of mine had some extra tickets

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
But boy did he have some good extra tickets

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
We got the front row

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Well I didn't Dark Soccer did

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And some of us were

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
I mean the venue was really nice

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We went to the Fox Theater in Oakland

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
It was a pretty venue

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I was taking pictures of the freaking architecture

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Is it a new venue? I've never seen anything there before

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
They're remodeling it

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Oh okay that makes sense

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
It's fairly old it's the Fox Theater in Oakland

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
On telegraph

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Gotcha

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Well um yeah

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
We went to Video Games Live

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And you know we had Tommy on the show

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Probably about what nine months ago Tommy Tallarico

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
The guy that you know is really the mastermind behind it

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Long enough to have a baby

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
He talked for a long time

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
When he was on the show

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
But no we really got some insight as to what was going on

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
So we finally got to check it out

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Because the show's been going for what three four years

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I never had a chance to check it out

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And Bobby reminded me

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Bobby Black Wolf is the show that's on before us on All Games Radio

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
When we tape live

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Bobby reminded me that I had been hazing Pong

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
As one of the selections for

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Inclusion

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
In Video Games Live

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
And actually it works

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
The whole classic game medley thing

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Was actually one of my favorite pieces they did

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Because it did time the music very well

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I had Ross Dunn in it

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I in turn will stay um

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
You need to see it though Loki

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
It's like for five seconds it's not even that bad

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I say that the Pong idea is stupid

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
It was fantastic

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I know on the record scene it's retarded

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And not fantastic in any way

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
You're just an asshole

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
No actually it was

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
It was good though the whole classic game medley was actually one of my favorite pieces that they did

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It was a good way to start the show

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I want my medley of Vectrex

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
You know the buzzing from the screen

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Well they did have

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Some really random stuff in there

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Like they had this

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Well I'm talking about some of the pieces

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
They did the interactive space invaders thing last night

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
That looked fun

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
They had a guy get up on stage and he would run to the left

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
And the ship would move left

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
And run to the right and the ship would move right

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
But you can tell it's just some dude in the back with a joystick

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Moving it in the direction that the guy is running

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Because there's huge massive lag

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
But no matter what he did the space invaders destroyed

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
The two world trade centers

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Shut up

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
But he did

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
He didn't win because

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Tommy was yelling shoot the sides you idiot

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Not like that but he's yelling shoot the sides

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And the guy didn't figure out how to do it

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
But I was thinking to myself

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
There's really not a lot of music in space invaders

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
It's literally three notes

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
That the orchestra is playing

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Sorry four notes

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
That the orchestra is playing faster and faster

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
With one person assigned to be the UFO

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Whatever the UFO would show up on screen

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I think the chorus was singing with it though

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Were they really?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I thought it was kind of cheesy

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
But it was cool

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Video games live is a very

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Unformal thing

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I was comparing it to the Dear Friends concert

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
That Square puts on that I've also been to

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Twice actually

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
The Dear Friends thing

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
That whole thing is more like

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
A night at the orchestra

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Granted there's a little more clapping and cheering

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
And interactivity

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
But like in video games live

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Tommy just comes right out and says

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
You just scream right along

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
You cheer for your favorite stuff

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
We just want everybody to have fun

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So you can tell right off the bat

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
They're going for a totally different type of setup

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Did anyone go whoa intermission

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
My favorite part

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Was there? There was applause for the intermission

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Because they had like a loading screen which was really funny

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I know it was cool It was funny

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I liked that they had before the show

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
And during the intermission they would have little

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
YouTubes like that Miss Pacman

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
For reals thing and some of these things would

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Show up randomly during the

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Usually dead parts and it was cool

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Okay so I had a good time

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
It was like a mini convention and obviously a lot

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Of the arrangements were beautiful

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I forgot just how awesome the music is

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
In Civ 4 I'm so happy they included that

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Piece because Civilization 4 was amazing

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
The singer was very nervous

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
The singer was very nervous

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
But he did a good job

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
He's got a gorgeous voice

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Oh yeah the god of war

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Not a series I've ever really been into

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Her voice was impressive Amazing

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Her voice was amazing

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Metroid makes me want to play that game now

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
The Metroid thing gave me a huge fan boner

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Obviously if you've listened to the show long enough

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
The minute Super Metroid

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
This is just the ending to Sonic 1

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I'm going Sonic Avenger

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
They're just putting it up there to show the other games

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Hush

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
They were just showing you the Mario thing

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
They showed like every Mario game in existence

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
You know what my favorite was Rob? What?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross debut

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Brand new World premiere we saw last night

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Of the oft requested

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Which to me was like Scars of Time

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Plus a couple other things

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Scars of Time is one of my favorite video game songs

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Period so I was just fine with that

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
That was like the World of Warcraft heckling

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
There was a piece that was called

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Ten Years of Warcraft

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
And the first guy

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Gets up and goes FOR THE HORDE

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
And there's people ahhh

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And then FOR THE ALLIANCE

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Boo

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Our area was booing, it was amazing

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Ok, parts I didn't like

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
And Jamie disagrees with me on this

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Here's the thing, when I say I didn't like it

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
This is like constructive criticism

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Overall I thought the show was great

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
But if there's one thing I could've replaced

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
With something else, because he goes up there and he says

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Hey we have like 60 things

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We could choose from and it's really hard to pick 20

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
That we can do here tonight, so my suggestion

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Lose the Guitar Hero Aerosmith

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Thing because it didn't fit

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
To me, it did not fit with the rest of the night

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
And yes I understand Guitar Hero is a video game too

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Blah blah blah, and yes we understand

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Tommy Tallarico is related to

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
But, but

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Here's the thing, I didn't go to

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Video Games Live to hear Sweet Emotion

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
You know what I mean? Dude I sure did

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
It just was not

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
What I wanted to hear, it felt like

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I could watch a dude play Guitar Hero any day of the week

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
On YouTube or any of that stuff

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I just didn't, I didn't care for that

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
And then when I go online and see

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Oh I could've heard Bioshock and instead

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
They gave me that, you know I just, I was a little disappointed

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I understand they want to give more stuff away

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Do another interactive cheer cheer cheer thing

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
But for me it didn't work, I didn't like it

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I think the best thing to have done

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
With that would be to have brought the guy out

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
And said here, here's your prize

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
This is the dude that won, yay

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Bye, and maybe

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I would even go for like a

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Music game tribute that does

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Like Guitar Hero and Rock Band little pieces

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Of the songs or something

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You know maybe even incorporate some DDR

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I don't know, they're gonna be cool, Space Channel 5

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I, I

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Okay, when they said that they were about to do

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
A tribute to the Sega game, was I the only one

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
That yelled out Space Channel 5?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
We all knew it would be Sonic

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Cause I, of course

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
We all knew it would be Sonic, but wouldn't it be amazing

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
If it was choo choo

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
It was Yuji Naka up there, and I love that I got to see

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
My musical hero twice

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Koji Kondo

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Oh yeah, he was up there on the big screen

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Yuji Naka was like, okay I suck at English

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
So I'm just gonna say it in Japanese

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
And I'm like, I don't have to use the subtitles

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
But um, it was

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I'll tell you what though, um

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
What I did, I had a fun time

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
With this part, was when he came out with

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
The guitar before the Chrono Trigger

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Bit, and like

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
So what do you, so, you know, we're gonna hear

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
All of this, it's like, play some Skynyrd, man

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And I was like, Freebird

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah, the minute he came out with his guitar, everybody started yelling

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Freebird, he's like, I'm not gonna play

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Freebird, and then after

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
The song was over, he says, okay, now I'm gonna play Freebird

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
So

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Actually, there was, there was somebody in our

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Section that called for Sweet

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Emotion, that called for

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Dream On, that was it

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Really, see, somebody else knew, I guess

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Black Wilson Chat right now and says, I've got the Video Games Live Chrono Trigger

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Song up on YouTube, this is a good arrangement

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Has it really hit YouTube already?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Dude, he said, get that on YouTube

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Tonight

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
That's true

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Now that's what I thought was great

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Cameras were encouraged

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Video taping was encouraged

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It was fun

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
There's no stick up the ass, cause keep in mind

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Every concert

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Okay, here we go, we got a little bit

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah, this is from last night, this is from user

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
GBPMike has put up

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Some of the arrangement

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah, this is from last night

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And you can hear everybody cheering and yelling in the back

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Let me skip ahead to some of the Scarra time piece

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I felt really bad for the flute player

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah, the flute player botched a little bit

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Missed a note, big time

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah, Scarra time is just a beautiful song

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And to hear that done live was cool

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
So anyway, yeah, the flute player missed a note

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I think even Martin Learned missed a note at one point

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I heard the piano, I don't know if it was him on piano

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I heard a bad piano note at one point

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I was like, don't!

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
But you know, mistakes happen, I'm not gonna be that critical

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
That's just, that's, you know

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It didn't ruin the night, come on

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
No it didn't

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I am, it ruined the night completely

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
How dare they miss a note

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I come for a perfect performance

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
It's a little different when you're the soloist

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Yeah, it's tough, that's a lot of pressure

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I doubt they have a lot of time to practice either

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
But you know, I've been there before

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So I can't really say anything

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
The only other thing

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It is an expensive asking price

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
The seats we had were 60 bucks

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I imagine the seats up in the nosebleeds were a lot cheaper

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
That's a hard price to call in this economy

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
But you know, that is the price of a video game

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
You know, considering no doubt

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Tickets are going for like 80 bucks right now

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
It's I guess what concert tickets are going for these days

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
But you know what, if you have the money

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
If you have the time

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Check it out when it goes to your town

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I wouldn't follow it around like a dead tour or anything like that

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Or I don't think I'd drive like a huge distance to see it

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
But I would definitely make it a point to see it

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
When it comes to my town again

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I might actually, you know

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I want to see different shows

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
They just announced, if you go to their site

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
They just announced like 45 new tour dates

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Or something like that

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
They are going to be playing a show

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
In LA on June 4th

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
During E3

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
So they love to do that

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
They love to kind of sync up with big nerd conventions

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And things of that sort

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
WonderCon was this one

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Yes

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Act F asked did they play the Metal Gear Solid song

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Yes they did

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
David Hayter doing intros

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
For each part

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
And Tommy Tallarico came out in the orange box

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And he was hiding in the box that said orange on it

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Lots of tour dates announced for Canada

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
If you're in Canada you're very happy right now

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
They're going to Saskatchewan

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
On May 11th, Alberta

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Calgary 15th, 16th

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Edmonton 18th

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
British Columbia, the 20th and 21st

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
All those dates in May

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
So they're doing a huge sweep of Canada in May

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Like even Winnipeg in July as well

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Singapore, they're going to be in Singapore

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Romania

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
France in November later on this year

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
They'll be in Portland, Oregon for a couple of shows

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
In November

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
San Diego July 23rd

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
New York, Lewiston

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
July 31st, so they're going to be all over

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Later this year

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Alright

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
So that was our experience of Video Games Live

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Otherwise as far as my gaming week goes personally

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I didn't have a whole lot else to do with my week

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
That was new

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Didn't play a lot of new stuff

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Still the old standby favorites

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
But I'm definitely this week going back to playing some Civ 4

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
After remembering how awesome the music is this week

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I was like, oh god I need to play this again

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Especially with the video and everything

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It makes you all warm and tingly

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Like a video game fan

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
So Dark Sakura, anything else in your gaming week

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Besides Video Game Live?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I actually, right before the show

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
When I was getting my slab of beef

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
With two crackers on either side

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
I was playing Raiden 2

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And Marvel vs Capcom

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And oh my god

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
I hate when an arcade machine is in such bad repair

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Oh god

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I was using the dragon though in Raiden 2

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
That was pretty fun

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I was just going to say

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Speaking of arcade machines

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
This is going to seem completely random

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
But I saw a news story on this this week

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Did you hear about that they're auctioning off all the arcade games

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That they had at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
They're going to try to sell all these games

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
The dude had a hip hop mania

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Or the machine

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
He had a Sega 360

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
He had one of those two, he had a lot of different types of machines

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
But he actually had a hip hop mania cabinet

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I kind of want it

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Like the starting price I think was only like 400 to 600 dollars

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I'm thinking about putting a bid on it

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Just for fun

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Dude, wouldn't it be awesome to have a freaking hip hop mania cabinet in here

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
That was like once owned by Michael Jackson

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
That would be kind of funny

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Dude, that is not auctioning off his moon walker

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I don't know why

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
But I think that's one of those random awesome things

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Dude, he had a jumbo safari machine

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Well keep in mind

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Who is his biggest

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Video game buddy

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Oh Sega

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Absolutely

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
He was in Space Channel 5 part 2

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Shut up Loki

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I said video game buddy

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
What? He played video games with him

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Macaulay Culkin is not a video game company

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
We said buddy

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
You did not specify

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Tigerclaw says I wonder did Michael Jackson even play those games

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Probably not

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Well maybe a couple of them

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
But who knows

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I doubt he played them all

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
But it would still be kind of cool to own a machine that was once at Neverland Ranch

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Come on, come on

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Who doesn't want to own a piece of history like that

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I think I'm seriously going to try to buy one of the machines

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I can't spend a lot of money

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
But you know, I'll try to get something, why not

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Alright

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Because if you win that arcade machine you better check it with a black light

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
They had a hip hop mania machine local

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Did they

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
It was a beat mania machine or something

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I sent Jamie the link to it

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
On Twitter like a while ago

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
That poor

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
And it was about the same price

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Interesting

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Not from Golfland though

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Not for sure, Roseville

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Hip hop mania, it's got to be from Golfland

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I swear to god though

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
If other Bamani fans out there try to outbid me on the hip hop mania machine

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
From Neverland Ranch

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I will cut you

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Jamie anything else

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I can't say names right tonight

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Anything else in your gaming week

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Um

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
No

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
City of Heroes

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
My thing expired now

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
So I don't know if I'm going to play

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Really stupid flash game

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
That I can't remember

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Oh yeah, I played with my virtual pet on

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Facebook today

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I also want to say that was the worst no answer I've ever heard

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
What

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Cause you said, I said is there anything else in your gaming week

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
You said no, but City of Heroes

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And Facebook games

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Oh

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Rob

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
What

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Loki how was your gaming week

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Oh I didn't play anything

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Except for, you know, Grand Theft Auto

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Lost and Damned

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
You're a little feisty tonight Loki

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I like this

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
No I'm getting over a cold actually

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Again, it's like cold the sequel

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
You know I first got sick and then I got better

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
And then I got the flu

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And then I got better

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
But now I'm coughing again

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
No so I was actually out sick

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
A couple days this week

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Unfortunately I forgot to bring my 360 home with me

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
So I didn't play anything during that time

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Um

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
But I did play Lost and Damned

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Mostly this week

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Really fun keeping me interested for a while

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Until I finish the story mode

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I also got to check out

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
A little bit of Eat Lead

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
The Return of Matt Hazard

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And it's kind of cheesy

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
But I kind of like it

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
It's got achievements like crazy

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
For the most redundant stupid things ever

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Like you start the game

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
And you get an achievement immediately

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
It's awesome

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
You pause the game and you get an achievement

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Um

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
It's great

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
But then

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
The whole game is just very

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Making fun of itself

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
And it's fun in that sense

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I mean the game itself is not that great

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
They do have some really cool stuff that they did with the cover system

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Like you can actually

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Look ahead and find a piece of cover

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And you hit a button and you'll actually

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Sprint to that location which is pretty cool

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And apparently the main character

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Likes that cover system too

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
As he comments on it as you're playing the game

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
And he also complains about having to go through

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
A tutorial which is funny

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Um

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
But yeah I haven't really gotten past the first stage yet

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Because I literally started playing it about 20 minutes

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Before I came over here

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Um

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
But it's fun

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And you can actually find it in stores now

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Or at least some stores

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Because Gamestop apparently

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Broke street on it everywhere

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Because they had it listed in their system

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
For the 26th of February

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
March 3rd

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
They just said ah fuck it we're not changing it in our system

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And so they just left it out

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
At what stores put it out

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
But it will be coming out everywhere March 3rd

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
So look for it then

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
But um

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah that's pretty much it

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
And no DJ Dark Knight I'm not talking about Killzone

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Because I didn't buy Killzone

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
And to be honest I'm actually gonna hold off on it

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Because I still haven't even played through Resistance 2 yet

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
So there's no way I'm gonna

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Start another game

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
You know well I am starting to eat lead

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
So I guess

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I can't really see much there but I'm not buying another game

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
You know for the PS3 right now

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
One game at a time right

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah I wanna get through Resistance

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
You know Killzone I'm not too interested in

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I never played the first one

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
The Resistance I've actually played you know the

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
The first game and went through the entire story line

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
So I actually kinda know what's going on

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And I kinda wanna play the Resistance 2 all the way through

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
And then maybe play Resistance

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Retribution when that comes out

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Um

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I might be getting a new car soon

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
One of the things I did this weekend was I went car shopping

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Yeah it kept me away from video games for a little while

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
And the reason why I bring that up is that if I do end up getting a car

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
And have to factor in a car payment into my budget now

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I'm probably gonna have to really cut back on the amount of new video games

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I buy so I

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I can definitely feel the pain of you know I don't have to get

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Killzone 2 just cause it's new

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
No and seriously that is the thing too

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
It's like I kinda almost feel like peer pressure

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Based on you know all the advertisements

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
And all the hype and stuff

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
And I look at it and it's like

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
You know it's just another shooter game

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Do I really need to play this and no I don't

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
It's the same with like Star Ocean

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I was gonna buy that and I'm like do I need to really play this right now

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
No I don't

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And it's the more I keep evaluating stuff like that

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
The less I'm buying

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Which is fine

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
You know cause there's gonna be

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Eat Lead was one of those games that looked funny

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
And I wanna play it and I didn't really give a crap about

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
You know the production value

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Or anything of the game cause

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
You know it's not an excellent

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Game but it's fun

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
So that's why I decided to play that one

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
And then of course you know

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I'm waiting for Mad World to come out

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Because it's a lot of blood and

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Killing which is gonna be so awesome

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Act deft in chat jokes

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Sky you're getting a Yaris? I'm considering it

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
It's not high up on my list anymore though

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
It was before but right now I'm

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I'm torn between another Corolla and a Jetta

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Rob if you get a Yaris the terrorists win

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Hahahaha

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
And by terrorists I mean

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
People that made the Yaris game

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Oh shut up

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Anything else Loki in your gaming week?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I was actually

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Also looking at

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Hacking lost and damned

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
But I haven't gotten around to actually

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Doing it

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Yet but I've

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Been looking at how I'm going

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
To do it

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Unfolded Raptor in our chatroom chat

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Says ask for the Yaris with a tentacle

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
They'll take me seriously

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
When I go into that dealership

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Alright and if you want to join along with us here on this Sunday night

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
If you're not listening to us live on Sunday why not?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
You got something better to do?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Alright maybe you do and that's why we put it out as a podcast

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
But check it out Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Live on Sunday nights when we tape at AllGames.com

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I also wanted to

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Show us your tweets segment

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
You guys sometimes

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Respond to our Twitter requests

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
At username O-L-R on Twitter

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
And just before the show I asked

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Hey Twitter when and if

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
VideoGamesLive comes to your town what do you hope

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
They'll play? Because you know I think there was

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Probably a song we wish they would have done

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
But they didn't do last night

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
For example I kind of secretly hope

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
The new song was like Kid Icarus

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
That would have been pretty rad

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Is there something you were hoping for?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I would love to hear the Wild Arms intro

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
That's a really good piece of music

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
So some of the chatters showed us their tweets

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Earlier on Twitter

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
D2 says the Guardian Legend of course

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
And I Love Pancakes

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
DJ Ratchet says I would want them to play

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Either Passion by Utada Hikaru

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Or the legendary theme for Guitar Man

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Even though I don't think that one would work

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And you know they do

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Simple and Clean obviously

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I think they do that one every show with the Disney montage

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
But I wouldn't mind

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
A little Kingdom Hearts 2 or a little bit of both

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Who knows

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Act Def says when they came to Mexicali I hope they would play

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
A Kirby song, sadly they didn't

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
A Kirby plus Orchestra equals awesome

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Crows says they're coming to Houston

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Late 2009, I want to hear a crapload

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Of Ace Combat 5 songs and the main

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Theme of Fallout 3

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Ooh that makes me think Bethesda, Oblivion

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Oblivion would be an awesome one here

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Peeger Uno says

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
The Let's Tap theme tune

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
And Harry AKA says

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Some of the beautiful music from Braid

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
That's not a bad suggestion either

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Braid had a very kind of ambient soundtrack

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
That might be pretty awesome to hear live

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And since they're always adding new stuff

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Kind of shuffling it up, keeping it fresh

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Who knows what's going to come to that in the future

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Show us your tweets

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
By following us on Twitter username

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
O-L-R, you know what

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I was going to mention

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Something that I was going to play this week

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
But I didn't get a chance to and I really

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Really sad

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh I also played more Nobby Nobby Boy

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
And I still don't get any

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
What's going on with that

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I might add that the Destructoid review of it

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Is hilarious

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
And I couldn't stop laughing for the dumbest reason

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
They had this song

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
That was in the background

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I don't even know what it's called

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
But something about wanting to smell your dick

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Or something like that

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
You gotta watch it

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
It's just like the weirdest thing

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
But that song in the background

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I was laughing for like 15 minutes afterwards

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I'm like what the hell was that

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Anyways, so completely off of that

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
LittleBigPlanet

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
They had a group

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Of seven different creators

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Actually go through

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
And create all

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Eight stages

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Of Contra

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
In LittleBigPlanet

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I've played the first one before

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
It's fun, it's fun

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
It's a good translation

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Yeah so they have all of them including

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Levels where you're inside the bases

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
And stuff and it's in that same perspective

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
And everything

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Pretty awesome, so definitely go check those out

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I'm planning on downloading them all

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
But uh

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Yeah that's it, and hopefully

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I'm hoping that this whole

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Hacking lost and damned thing works

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
To have some more funny videos

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Coming out

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
It's funny if you break open

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
The lost and damned

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Download content

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
It's actually in the exact same

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Format as the PC

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Version as far as the files that are in there

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
So

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
In theory you could edit it just like

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
The PC version and do all sorts of

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Crazy shit, so I'm looking

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Forward to trying that out

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Interesting, by the way I'm going back and forth

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
A little bit in chat, apparently

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
According to our

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Old buddy Bobby

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
There will never be Oblivion or

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Prey or Guild Wars music heard

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
At Video Games Live

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
And apparently there's some type of feud going on

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Between Jeremy Sule

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
The guy who does the music for all those

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Games I just mentioned, and Tommy Tallarico

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Like there's a big

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Gamer composer feud going on

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
There or something, I don't know

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Can't we all just get along

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Yeah, never say never

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Money talks

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Things that we thought would never happen

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Have happened

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Whoever thought we would boot up our Nintendo

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
GameCube and see a Sega logo

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Right?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Whoever thought there would have been a Marvel DC

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
crossover

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
That was old

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Anyhow, other housekeeping this week

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I don't really have a whole lot

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Of housekeeping this week

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I did housekeeping

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Just continue to support us on the web

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Again if you've not visited the new

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Orangelaunchradio.com you need to

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Check it out, DarkSakura uploaded some of the pictures

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
She took from Video Games Live actually

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I uploaded the one to the main page there

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Of the marquee, but if you go into

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
The OL Army picks on the gallery

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
You can actually upload your own pictures

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
And DarkSakura actually uploaded

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Some things to the gallery

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Including a picture of herself

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Taken earlier today it looks like

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Oh my god!

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
A wild Jamie approaches

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Use your pester ball

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And then some cool pictures from Video Games Live

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
I love my picture of Master Chief

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Some of these came out great, you should send those to Tommy

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I bet he'd get a kick out of that

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Some of these are a little blurry, but that one and that one

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Are really good, you should send those in

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I took them with my iPhone

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
For iPhone pictures it's not bad

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Somebody apparently uploaded a thing that says

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Rob is officially gayer than Christmas

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Rob versus Chris, you'll just have to

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Check it out

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
No, I bet anything it was Travis and John

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Last night on Understation Live

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
This just seems like something they'd do

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
This reeks of

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
John and Travis somehow

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Like, hey, how can we fuck

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
With the new Orangelaunchradio.com, I know

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Let's make a Rob is gay joke

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Ah, see, isn't it fun

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Being friends with them for so long

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I know, I know, those little bastards

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Alright, but I love them

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
In a totally homosexual way

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Alright, let's get to some

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Gaming news, low-key

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Well, you may remember last week, Capcom was teasing

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Something that they were going to announce

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
On Monday, well, that announcement

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Was Lost Planet 2

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
And Lost Planet 2

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Looks very epic, very cold

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Still, yet strangely enough

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Like in a jungle

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It's a frozen jungle

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
But they have a bunch of other cool stuff

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
It looks pretty sweet

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Right now

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Only announced for the 360

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
And so it's

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Possibly going to be a 360

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Exclusive, at least for a while

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
But, you know, the first game was that way too

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
So, who knows

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
And then some other cool stuff

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
They're going to have 4 player online co-op

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Which is pretty neat

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
And, I don't know, I think the game looks really cool

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Different environments

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
They even have some sort of mech thing

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Because before you can get the mech suits

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Well, now these mech suits can get into a bigger mech suit

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
That's like

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Voltron-esque

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
So, that looked kind of neat

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
But, very exciting

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
But, no word on when this is planning on

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Being put out, but I'm sure we'll hear more about it

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
During E3

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Well, I suppose that's a slight more surprise

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Than Dead Rising 2, which is what we predicted

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
On last week's show would be the announcement

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
But at the same time, Lost Planet 2

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Should not be that big of a surprise

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Yeah, especially when you consider that

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
They have the Lost Planet movie

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
That they're pouring billions and billions of dollars into

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And, you know

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
So

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I guess that's not too big of a surprise

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
I was going to chat

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
By the way, Travis says it was not us

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
That did the Rob is Gator than Christmas picture

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
So, that was just forever a mystery

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
And now he's also saying Under Station Live

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
What if it was Fart Princess?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
It could have been

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Now he's also saying Under Station Live is coming to an end

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
And I'm just like, huh?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
So, I want more information

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
On what this is all about

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I'm going to call you later, Travis

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
You better call in later, Travis

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I want details, what the hell is going on?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Alright, anyhow, back to video games for now

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Assassin's Creed on the PSP

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
A lot of announcements coming out of Sony camp

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
This week about the PSP

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
One of their destination Playstation events

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Assassin's Creed is going to be coming

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
To the PSP

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Ubisoft will be putting it out on the

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Sony portable system a little later this year

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Apparently there's also going to be

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
An Assassin's Creed bundle coming out as well

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
With, you know, a PSP with it

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
So

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
There you go, Assassin's Creed coming out

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
A little later this year for you fans of that game

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
And also for fans of

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Having games on the PSP

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
So there you go

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
In other news

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Speaking of PSP stuff

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Um

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
You know there's actually something

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
About LittleBigPlanet

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
It's going to be on PSP

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Because I said so

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
And because apparently Sony says so too

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And it's going to be sometime

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Before the end of the year

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
That it is in conjunction with

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Media Molecule and it's supposed to be

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Very much like the PS3 version

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Where you can

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
You know, make your levels

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
And share them and play the game

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
And play everybody else's crap

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
But just take it with you

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
You know what I think

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I think that it's going to be

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
You would download everything

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Through the Playstation

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Like you do

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Through the PS3 like you do now

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
With whatever link to the

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
PSP

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I think that this is one of the biggest

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Does to come out of the Playstation event

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I mean LittleBigPlanet's been

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
You know, a huge new IP for them

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Although I don't know how well it's been selling here in the US

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
But I think it's been doing much better overseas

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
But you know, I think this is no surprise

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
At all that they're putting a port of this

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
On the PSP, we had rumors about this a few months ago

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
No surprise here

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I guess I am surprised though that Media Molecule's

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Not doing it themselves, that's kind of

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Interesting

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
I'm not surprised because they're busy doing like

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
You know, expansions and stuff

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
For the main game

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Someone else port it, that's fine

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
As long as it turns out alright

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I was going to say also that

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
You know, I think it's pretty cool

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
That they're actually taking the PSP

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Seriously this year

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
You know, putting out some pretty strong games

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Because remember last year and stuff

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
They're all like, oh that's the year of the PSP

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
And then nothing really came out

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Other than the Crysis core

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Or a new PSP, a new design

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
What baby do, but you know

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I don't know, I think it's kind of cool

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Something else that's going to be coming to the PSP

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Another PS3 franchise there

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Motorstorm Arctic Edge

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Which is of course

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Going to be more

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Arctic themed

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Than the other games that are going to add

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Snowmobiles as well

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
You can expect all sorts of stuff

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Including some of the stuff that they

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Showed off in their pre-rendered

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Intro video that they kind of do

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
No gameplay footage is actually shown

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
But you know, stuff like

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Maybe interactive environments including

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Avalanches, collapsing

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Snowbridges, you name it

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
And of course always some

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Poor sap falling off of a dirt bike

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And getting hit by some giant

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Vehicle

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
The game will also be

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Ported to the PlayStation 2

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
As well, so

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Because they tend to port a lot of those PSP

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Games to the PS2 and vice versa

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Makes sense

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
They're still cranking out PS2 games

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Still selling well, so

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Why not?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I guess the price is right

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
And it's probably pretty easy for them to port stuff like that to the PS2

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Might as well, I mean

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Get some more sales that way

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Alright, well if none of those

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Games sounded interesting to you at all

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Maybe this is a little more up your alley

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
A new Hannah Montana

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
PSP bundle

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Oh joy! That's right, this is coming out in

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
July, it's going to be a PSP in a

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Brand new color called Lilac

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Imagine if babies

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Shit purple, and that's the color

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Of this PSP, that's pretty much the best

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Way to describe it, it will come with

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
A new Hannah Montana rhythm game

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I wonder if this is the same game that

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Did somebody let Footy Monster know

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
That this is coming out, because he's a big fan of the

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Hannah Montana music games

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
But also it's coming out

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
With a UMD of episodes

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
From Hannah Montana, also a

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Two gigabyte memory stick coming with it

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
And, and, and

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Stickers to decorate your

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
PSP with Hannah Montana

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
So there you go

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Apparently some also

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Casual other things coming to the

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
PSP, Ubisoft has

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
His Pets series coming to the PSP

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Pets Saddle Club

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Being one of the first releases in September

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Obviously this is happening

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
To compete with the DS a little bit

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Because they have the whole Carrie Underwood

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Playing a pink DS commercial

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
So Sony has

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Now tapped into Hannah Montana, which is

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
You know what, lover or hater

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
It's a huge brand for

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
You know, tween girls, so

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I guess this is the way to go, right

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
To try and sell some of these at Christmas time

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
That they've tapped Hannah Montana

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Shh, isn't that illegal

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
You know what I mean, you ass

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
La la la la la la

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Exactly, so

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I don't know though, I

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Kind of want a baby shit purple

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
PSP because I don't think anybody else would have

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
One, it is an interesting

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Color, but I want one of the blue ones more

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
I think, I'll get the Madden pack

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
That came with the blue PSP

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Even though I have a perfectly fine and

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Functioning PSP right now

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I kind of want the lilac one, but not bad enough to go for

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Hannah Montana

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I'm also just kind of like

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
You know the PSP 2 announcements coming

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Probably at E3, so if I can at least

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Make myself wait until E3 to upgrade

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
My PSP, then I'll have motivation

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
To just wait even longer until PSP 2 comes out

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I think there will be something

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
There will be another revision

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
From what I heard, it was supposed to be even

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Slimmer with a sliding screen, but that's

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
About it, I mean

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
It's still best to be the same thing

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Eh, whatever, who cares, it's not going to help

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
GioVedea in chat says

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Tap ass and Hannah Montana

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Should not be said in the same sentence

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
I apologize to any listener that was offended

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Alright

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Enough Hannah Montana, please

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
DarkSakura, help us change the subject

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
How about release dates?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Well we've got quite a bit for the UK

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
And I'm going to go on and go through next Sunday

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Since it will already be after that

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
By the time they get this

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
So on March 4th, we have

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Empire Total War

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
That's for PC

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
On the 6th, Battle Fantasia

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
There's also

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
New Play Control, Mario Power Tennis

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Patapon 2

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Tenchu, Shadow Assassins

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Tom Clancy's Hawks

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Watchmen, The End is Nigh

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
That's for PC, Xbox 360

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
And Playstation 3

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
And Flock for Xbox 360

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
The Playstation 3 version

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Says it's out on the 9th

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah those are the

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Live arcade games

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Or Playstation Network games

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Is that it?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Does it

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Well in the US, there's actually quite a bit

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Coming out this week

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Lots of stuff, including

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
The big title, Halo Wars

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Coming out on Xbox 360

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
On

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
PSP, we're getting

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Phantasy Star Portable

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Which is the remake of the Ambition of the

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Illuminus expansion

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
We've also got MLB

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Both O9

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
And 2K9

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
O9 of course coming out on all Sony

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Platforms and 2K9

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Coming out on pretty much everything but the

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
DS

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
version is getting MLB

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
2K9

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Phantasy All Stars

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Which is a weird looking game

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
But whatever

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Empire Total War coming out on

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
PC

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Also that week

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
We've got SBK Superbike World

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Championship coming out on

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
PS3, Xbox 360

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
And Wii and Playstation 2

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I believe

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Also

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Tom Clancy's Hawks

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
On Xbox 360

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
And on PS3

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Wii Ski and Snowboard

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
On the Nintendo Wii

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Kind of a sequel to that

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Wii Ski game that came out last year

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Also

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Coming out

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
As well

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Littlest Pet Shop Spring

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Cause there's just not enough of those games

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
King of Fighters 98

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Ultimate Match coming out on

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Playstation 2

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Little retro fighting action there

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
And then Spongebob vs.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
The Big One Beach Party Cook Off

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Your Spongebob themed Cookie Mama

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Game

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Sonic and the Black Knight

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
On the Wii

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
And

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Finally

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Sad

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Thing to end on but Grey's Anatomy

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Coming out on PC

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
DS and the Wii

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I'm very curious to see

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
How that game performs

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Because it's either going to start a trend

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Of all these like you know

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Interesting drama

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
It's not going to do well

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I can tell you right now

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
They're putting it out for a reason right?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Yeah because they bought the license rates

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
These people put out weird stuff

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Look at for example

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
On the DS there's a company bringing out

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
A Johnny Bravo game

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Seriously?

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
A Johnny Bravo game now?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I bet that will outsell Grey's Anatomy

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Yes it probably would actually

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Alright let's head over to Japan

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And look at some of the release dates in Japan

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Because of course the types of things they get in Japan

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Usually come out here a little later

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Or around the same time as is the case of

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Biohazard 5 is coming out on March 5th in Japan

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Of course Biohazard is the Japanese name for

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Anybody?

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Anybody?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Your mom!

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
PlayStation 3

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Also getting Biohazard 5

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Which seems to be dominating the week over there this week

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
But don't count out

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
MLB 09 the show

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
And Senju no Valkyria

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Is getting a price reduction as well

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Which is just you know

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Valkyria Chronicles over here in the US

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
On the Nintendo Wii

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
On March 5th

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Only one big release is

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Relaxuma

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Mina de Goryuri

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Sekkatsu is coming out

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Which looks like a game with cute little animals

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Um

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
There's no screenshots

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Just cute little finger painted

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Survivor horror game

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Somehow I doubt it

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I'm sorry to say

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
PlayStation 2 has Galaxy Angel 2

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Coming out as well as Need for Speed

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Pro Street and Sengokushi

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
X gets a price

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Reduction as it moves into

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
A greatest hits type series over there

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Nintendo DS 7th Dragon

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Is a big release over there this week

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
That is a game coming from Sega

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
That's an RPG

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Kimo Koei

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
And Simple DS

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Volume 47 because every week

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
It seems like over there there's another Simple DS game

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Coming out

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Lastly on the PSP

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
It looks like there's

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
They're getting the 3000

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
In blue this week in Japan

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
And red

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
And a lot of matching

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Gear coming out to match that

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Otherwise Mina no Golf

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Portable which is just Hotshots Golf

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Is getting a price reduction

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
There you go, not a lot of huge stuff in Japan this week

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Since you have Resident Evil 5

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
New colors that they have for the DSI

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Just the black and the

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Crappy blue

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
No they have the new colors for

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Japan

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
They have this weird

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Not even maroon it's like a

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Pinkish

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Purple

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Magenta color system

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
They got this weird lime green

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
And a dark blue

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
It's probably better than the colors here

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
That light blue is terrible

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I don't want a DSI in that color

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Well I don't really want a DSI anyway

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I'm not sold on it yet

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Me neither

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Maybe when some of the DSI games start coming out

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I hardly ever play handhelds unless I'm like

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Embed sick or something you know

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I'm just not a big handheld fan

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
It's when you have the flu

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
It's the flu system

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
It's the DS flu

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Well how about some WiiWare stuff

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Yeah give me a reason to turn on the Wii

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Well you can get beer pong

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Frat party games

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
You have a

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Your table set up with

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Four people

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Up to four people playing

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
And you have to throw ping pong balls into a paper cup

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Now is this story coming out of Europe

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Because I would think, I thought we got that game

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
A while ago. Yeah this is Europe

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Yeah I thought we had, but they had to change

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
It to like party toss or what did they call it

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Pong toss

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
So they're actually getting beer pong over there

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
They're getting beer pong frat party games

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I'm glad to hear their feathers aren't so ruffled over there

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
And they're getting speed pong

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Where you use power ups

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
To slow your other people down

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
There's also snowboard riot

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Where

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
You go down and you

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Attack people and defend yourself

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
With your snowboard?

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
I guess. Or you riot in LA with a snowboard

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
That sounds like it could be kind of fun actually

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
It seems like road rash with a snowboard

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
That might be alright

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
So, anyway

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
The beer pong is 800 Wii points

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Snowboard riot is 1000

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
And

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I guess speed pong would also be 800

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
I suppose

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
And spoiler alert, beer pong's not worth it

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
For 800 points there

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Dammit!

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I was wanting to play it for myself

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
And find that out, Loki

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Jerk

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Seriously, you can buy cups and a ping pong ball

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
For cheaper

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
And you can get drunk

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
But only if you're 21 or over, please

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I was gonna say

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I don't know if you noticed, this week actually

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Was the first week that they started offering

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I guess over here, I thought they were available

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Over here already, but

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I thought we mentioned 64 games on the virtual console

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
I thought we mentioned it last week's show

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I don't remember, maybe we didn't

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Because I remember getting into a conversation about

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
No, I guess not, if they just came out on Monday

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I guess we wouldn't have brought it up yet

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Yeah, no, I saw that they were there

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I haven't downloaded any yet

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Because I'm still on my stupid little

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I'm not downloading anything else kit

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Well seriously, what, they announced a solution how long ago now?

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
And

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Here's the thing, well

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
There is one thing that will break it

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
When the whole mission comes out, I have to get it

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I have to

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Because I loved that game on the Commodore 64

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
So that'll be the thing that gets me to break

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
But that didn't come out yet

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
So we'll see

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I never agreed to do it

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Well if I conveniently forget to turn on the Nintendo Wii 2

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I probably won't even remember to download it

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
And if I just stay away from blog sites on Monday

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I won't ever hear it's out

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
But now that I said that, I'll get a million emails

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
From listeners saying, hey Rob

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Did you break your thing yet?

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Well the whole mission came out today

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Jerk

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Seriously though, when are they gonna, they're probably gonna make this big announcement

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
At E3, it's like, yes

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
We're gonna have a storage solution

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
You know, we totally never announced this before

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
At Christmas, or you're gonna have to buy this new system to get it

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Yeah, you're gonna have to buy, yeah

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Ugh

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Hate them

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Hate them all

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I love Nintendo

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Because we have Choaniki

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Whatever

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
So

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
There's this new game

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
That's kind of exciting

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I guess

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Since it does have Excite in the name

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Excitebots Trick Racing

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
It's coming out on the Nintendo Wii

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
April 20th

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
And no one seems to know

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
What it is

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
It's so crazy

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
What exactly is ExciteTruck

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Or ExciteBots

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
It is being made by the people that did ExciteTruck

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
And the ExciteBike

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Or franchises

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I've never heard this game, this is completely

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
No, this is, I've never, this is a shock

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Completely new news to me

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Complete utter shock to me

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Okay, no, really, I have heard about this

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
And it's funny that no one seems to know

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
What the game is about

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
And

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Probably better that they don't

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I mean

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Surely it wouldn't be something as stupid as like

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
The bots battle each other or something

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Like it's a racing like robot

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Thing where they actually like a

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Mech thing, it wouldn't be that stupid would it

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Yeah

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
It wouldn't be like, you know, that they took

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
This awesome racing game

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
And said, hey you know what would be awesome instead

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Of making a, I don't know, a sequel to it

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
And just not really changing anything

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
But adding some more tracks

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
How about we just take the whole game, take a shit

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
On it and turn it into a party game

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Ha ha

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
And then we have ExciteBots

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
No, they wouldn't do anything like that at all

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Oh god, I hope not, in fact

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
It would be crazy like, you know, they could have

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
A weird synopsis for it or something

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Um, just trying to think of what exactly

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
We would say

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Ha ha

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Um, I don't know

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Um, make something up

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Try to make up what a possible synopsis

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
For ExciteBots

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Might read

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
ExciteBots, um, let me think here

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Um

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Um

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Uh, let's see

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
If I were to guess

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
An ExciteBots

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Trick racing synopsis

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I would say that ExciteBots

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Trick racing takes the big air thrills

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
And simple controls of ExciteTruck

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
And ramps up the fun with a non-stop

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Barrage of funky challenges and minigames

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Performed at a blinding speed

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
You won't believe your eyes when you find yourself

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Shooting goals, throwing pies

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Even playing poker in the middle of racing

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Robotic animals, insects

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Around off-road tracks

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
God damn, Loki

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
You are one hell of an improv artist

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I know, it's so crazy

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
How poetic in your description

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
And I also might say that it would support two to six players

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Over Wi-Fi

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Why can't you be that eloquent normally?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I just don't have it in me

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
You just got excited about it

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
You're just too full of cheese

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Sadly enough, I do want to play this game

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I'm scared

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
That they fucked this up

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
And it's like

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I've been waiting so long for an ExciteTruck

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Sequel

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
And I know they fucked this up

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It's like, you can't fuck this up

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
You just do the same thing, put out the same damn game

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Just change the tracks, add different cars

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
You don't have to do anything

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
It's sold okay

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
But I know they fucked this up

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
And it's really scaring me

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
So I'm loading up this

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
To read this comment in chat

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Um

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
X-Link says Excitebox

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It will make you shit your pants

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Which, by the way, this is a game I played a ton of this week

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
That Flash game

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Don't shit your pants

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
That's my favorite

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
New little sound I've heard in a Flash game

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Just Google it if you have no idea what I'm talking about

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Um

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Anyhow

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Comments from chat, I'm sorry

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
No more comments from chat

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Tigerclass says why can't they do a sequel to ExciteBike

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
ExciteBike

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Not ExciteTruck, but ExciteBike

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Um, they could do that

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
ExciteTruck with ExciteBikes in there

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Oh my god, look at that

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
It's expanding on the franchise

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Do it like MotorStorm, I mean come on

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Oh no

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
People that play the Wii don't want to actually play a real game

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
They want to play another fucking party game

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Because where will they get party games on the way

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
They're just not available

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
GS68 suggests ExcitePants

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Mix the magic of ExciteTruck with the

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Suspense of don't shit your pants

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
The game and you have ExcitePants

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I'm, I'm, let me put it this way

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
We have a toilet at one end of the course

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I'm still gonna play this game

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I'm still gonna try it out

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I'm just, the description so far

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
And the fact that I haven't seen any

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Screenshots

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Or know anything about it

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
It kind of scares me right now

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
But I don't understand how playing poker

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
And driving really fast

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Correlate with each other

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
It makes no sense to me

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
You can always give this game the wife test

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Does the wife like it?

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Yes, that's definitely gonna happen

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Uh, hey, other news

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
About the Nintendo Wii, now this sounds

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Thank god, a lot different and I'm sure it's gonna

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Get a lot of people very happy and I don't know how you feel

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
About this one, Loki

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
It was recently trademarked here in America

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Final Fantasy IV The After Years

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
And that's a cell phone series

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Over in Japan, well guess what?

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
It has been announced this week

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
That it's going to be coming out for

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
The Wii, well I guess it hasn't really been announced

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
But the ESRB has rated the title

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
An E on the Wii

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
So, uh, there you go

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Final Fantasy IV The After Years

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Apparently getting somewhat confirmed

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
For the Nintendo Wii

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
So, that probably won't be

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Any mini games, I don't think it was over in Japan

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
And I think, if I remember correctly

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I think the one in Japan was actually like

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
In the Final Fantasy IV engine

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I think so, because it was a cell phone game

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
So I'm kind of curious to see if they

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Still keep it looking like that on the Wii

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
It could be a download thing

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Like it might be WiiWare, it might not necessarily be a disc

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
It could be something that's gonna be released

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
It's gonna be WiiWare, that's what it was supposed to be

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
That could be kind of cool then, because it could be

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Like in the style of Mega Man 9, right?

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
That'd be cool

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
So, that

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
That could also be something that

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Makes me want to break my little

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Band, even though my hard drive

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Is completely full

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Come on, if they

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Fuck this up

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I'm out for blood

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
You heard it here first

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Alright, so there you go, Final Fantasy IV The After Years

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I want to definitely check that out

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Well, there's a

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Device that we've discussed on the show

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
A number of times, and I have

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
One myself in the family of it

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Which I will not name nor say

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Or let anyone know where

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I'm hiding it, because I actually just found

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
It while I was cleaning it

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Yeah, I can't find my DS

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Thingy

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
No, I can't find my DS, too

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
And the thingy that's in the DS

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I found my thingy

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I found the thingy in the box

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
What thingy?

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Okay, I have a Ninja Pass

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
I have not used it, I have nothing on it

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
I have a 4DS and an M3

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
And I put tons of pirated games on both of them

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
But, to be honest, I haven't played my DS

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
In forever, so much so that it's

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Buried in a room somewhere, so

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Back to my story

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
And it's funny that you mentioned the R4

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
That's why I bought it, too

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Because, you know

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
The R4

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Is now officially outlawed

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
In Japan

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
You cannot, um

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
There's actually an injunction

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Filed against the Chinese

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Um, manufacturer

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Put out by the Tokyo District Court

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
And, um

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
It's now illegal to sell

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Anywhere in Japan

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Um

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
In fact, there, you can't find them

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
In stores anymore, at all

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Um, Squeenix

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Capcom, Nintendo

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Um

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
You know, the big guys, they're

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Saying that, you know

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
That because of the illegal sales

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Um, you know, they're gonna also make

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Sure that they're gonna

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Try to, you know, knock down anyone

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Who's selling the other types that are like

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
The R4

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Um, but

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Who knows, the other countries might be

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Following suit

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Interesting

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
We haven't heard about a lot of

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Devices getting banned over there, so this is

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Uh, and now, now

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Loki, you're breaking the law

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Of another country, but

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Boo hoo

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Rob

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
You see that cup

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
On the floor? What?

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
You get caned for that in Singapore

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Oh gee, oh no

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
So you're breaking the law of another country

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
It doesn't matter, like I said, you know, I

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I don't even play

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
My DS right now

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Or my PSP

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Uh, out of curiosity, is there anyone

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
In chat who owns one of these who thinks

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
This is, uh, you know, interesting

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Surprising? Are you

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Scared? Cause now you have one, or are you just

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Like, whatever

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I'm totally not surprised, to be honest

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Yeah, I know, it's not, it's not totally surprising

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
But, uh, you know

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Oh well, there's nothing

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
In, you know, unfortunately with the

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Um, DS, they can't really flash it to

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
You know, not work

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
With, or to basically

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Break it or anything, they can't do any firmware updates

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Like they can with the, uh, PSP

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Or whatever it means, they'll stop selling it

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Or if you'll still be able to get them over here

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Um

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Well, they've already made them pretty hard to get

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Um, in fact, when I was

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Buying mine, um

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
They were pretty hard to get

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
And

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
You know, they were starting to pull them off, you know

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Shelves online

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
And stuff like that, so that

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
You know, they wouldn't get in any lawsuit

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Trouble, but, uh, luckily

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I got both of mine, actually the M3

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
And the R4 are almost identical

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
In fact, I think there's like one little point

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
That you change on each chip that

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
You can convert them back and forth

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And, um

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I don't know, they work okay

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
You know, the one I bought, the M3 for

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
For Game Boy Advance

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Homebrew stuff, because there was this one

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Motocross game I wanted to try out, and there was some other

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Like Zelda type game that I wanted to try out, that was kinda cool

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Um

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I haven't really played any ROMs

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
For the Game Boy Advance stuff

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Not really interested in that

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And, uh, DS stuff, it's fun to check stuff out

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Every now and then, but really nothing holds my

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Interest for

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Hardly any time, so I don't

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I just don't see the point in spending, you know, 20 bucks

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
On, you know, each of these games

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
And that's on a cheap game, you know

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Unless you get something Square Enix, which is like

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
$40 for a fucking DS game

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Which is retarded

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Um, I just can't see myself

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Spending that kind of money on a game that I'm only gonna

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Play for a few hours and just kinda throw

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
You know, to the side

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
It's just my own thing, economy's tough, you know what

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And I wasn't gonna buy your game anyways, so

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But hey, I spend

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
My money, I spend plenty of money on

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Other things, you know, like I said

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
You know, what, the last week or so

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Or a couple weeks ago, I

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Five copies of Lost and Damned, so

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
You know, I'm paying my money

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Alright, let's move on with more news, we gotta wrap up Part A

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Get to Part B tonight

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Yes, um, so

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Kind of a game that I like

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Um, you know

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Saints Row, well, another

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Guy, a music artist

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
That has broken into the game genre as well

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
50 Cent is actually

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Looking to option

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Saints Row for a movie

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Now

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
This sounds like an okay

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Idea to me, but

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Not that great, I don't know

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
There are some actual characters in Saints

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Row, so it works, but then again

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
The whole game is very sandbox-ish

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And you can make your own

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
You know, main characters, so

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Designing who the main character

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Is gonna be is a little bit tough, I think

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But as far as an actual storyline goes

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It's kind of compelling, there is one

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
But, I don't know

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I think that type, anything that's

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Sandbox-ish, as far as

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Gameplay goes, it's gonna be very hard to

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Um, make

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
A movie out of, but

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Anyways, he's interested in it

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
He says, according to

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
50 Cent

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
He said that his

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Relationship with THQ

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Is very good, and

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
You'll see Saints Row, he's

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Optioning the rights for that right now

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Dude, I hope the plot is as awesome as

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Blood on the Sand

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
You know, Blood on the Sand, I think to be honest

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Is just

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Fun, that's the whole point, it wasn't like

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
He was trying to be serious, I think it was just fun

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Speaking of plot and movies

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And something that didn't make our show

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Roll tonight, but I was chatting with somebody before

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
The show about this, have you heard about

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
How horrifically the new

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Street Fighter movie is doing, apparently it has a

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
0% on Rotten Tomatoes

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Right now, oh I would believe it, I mean

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
It looks like crap, I'm sorry

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I, one of my live journal friends went

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And saw it and said it is worse than the original

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Street Fighter movie, if you can imagine

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Yeah, that was actually a ringing

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Endorsement to me, I love bad movies

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Now I kind of want to go see it

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
It's out? Yeah, it just came out on Friday

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I completely forgot about it

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I wonder how terrible it did at the box office

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Because box office numbers come out

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Let me go look

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It was pretty much

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Street Fighter the movie this week

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And Jonas Brothers

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
In 3D

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Okay, Madea Goes to Jail

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Was the number one movie this week

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
With 16.5 million bucks

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Jonas Brothers

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
12.7 million, which they say was

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Actually underperforming compared to the Miley Cyrus

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Movie a few months ago

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Slumdog Millionaire 12.1 million

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
But it just won the Oscar

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So it was not in the top 3

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Nor was it 4

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
5 or 6

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Or 7

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Street Fighter came out its opening weekend

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Number 8

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
4.6 million dollars

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
What did it beat? Confessions of a Shopaholic

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
In its third week of release

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Ah, Friday the 13th

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
In its third week of release

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Fired Up in its second week of release

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Ah, but what beat it?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Paul Blart

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Mall Cop in its seventh week of release

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Hey, made more money than Street Fighter

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
The Legend of Chun-Li in its seventh week

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Of release

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Coraline, but I hear that's a good movie

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
So we don't need to make fun of that

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It's Street

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Okay, it's a Street Fighter movie

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
That has like

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Hardly any

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Characters in it that, you know, make any

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Sense, you know, Bison doesn't even look like

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Bison

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Balrog is, I don't even know what

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Kinda character he's supposed to be playing

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And Chun-Li doesn't even look like Chun-Li

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And the plot's just like

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Huh?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I hope they all do their pose

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
At the end though, that was the best part of the first movie

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Alright, well hey

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Speaking of game movies, a good

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Game movie, I think anyway, a lot of people

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Disagree with me, but one of the better ones

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
In many many years, in my opinion, Silent Hill

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Was, you know, a video game movie

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
That came out, I liked it, we all

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Generally liked it right here, I saw it four times in the

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Theater, you really liked it, I saw it twice

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Loki liked it, yeah, so I think we can all

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Agree that the Silent Hill movie's pretty awesome

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And of course

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
We love the series of games, love the series

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Of games, well guess what, maybe not so much

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
The last few, but yeah, well

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I didn't think they were terrible, but

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Anyway, obviously one of the best ones

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Was the first one, and guess what

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Since we're talking about remaking games

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
For the Wii, a WiiMake if you will

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
There's been lots of these types of

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
WiiMakes coming out recently, now most of them

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Granted have just been old GameCube games getting new

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Controls, but what if they were to remake

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
The original PlayStation Silent Hill

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Game on the Nintendo Wii

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
With extra fog?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Hopefully, you know why they did the fog

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Why, cause loading or something?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Uh, well anyway

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
This is coming

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
From a report from VG

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
24-7, apparently Konami

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Is planning a port

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Of the Silent Hill game

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
For the Wii, also coming to the

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
PSP as well, Climax

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
The folks who did Silent Hill

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Origins are the ones that are supposed to be doing this new

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Remake, so that could be interesting

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
You know, I'm surprised that Climax

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Has an exactly optioned

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
N-Spaces engine that they use for

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
The game that's not ever coming out

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Unfortunately, Winter, cause remember

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
That game looked very much Silent Hill

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Wonder if they're using it, though

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
You gotta wonder, maybe that's part of

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Why they're doing this on the Wii

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Is maybe the folks at Konami saw this

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
And was like, hey, we want you to

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Make this a Silent Hill game, but we got a really

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Good idea, why don't you redo the

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
First story, or something like that, you know?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Could be

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Remake the first one is a test of your skill

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Could be, huh?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Why don't they just make a new one?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Well, maybe they want the new ones to be

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
On the 360 in PlayStation 3

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Stop remaking shit, seriously!

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I want a remake

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I wouldn't mind a remake in the first game

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I really freaking want a good Silent Hill remake

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Here's the thing, it could be a remake

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Like a new play control remake

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Yoink, yoink, yoink, whatever, right?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
But it could also be a remake like Metroid Zero

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Which is an awesome remake

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I hate to interrupt real quick

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
But I'm so glad that the

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Monitor obstructed the camera's view

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Of the gesture that you just made

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Why? What'd I do?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Oh, yeah

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
That's why we have the big monitor here

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
It censors my hand when I do things like that

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
So no one can see Rob fapping

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Alright, look

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
You know I have to derail it

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Alright

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Silent Hill, we want it

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
You know other stuff we want?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Punch out!

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Nah, I just want to punch

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
So, so

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Getting this

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
May 18th, we're getting Punch Out on the Wii

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And little Mac looks like he

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
All done grown up

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
He actually looks kind of mean in this picture

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So um

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
We will be getting some um

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Punch out and hopefully

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
That we will get like King Hippo and

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
You know Glass Joe and all of those

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I hope they make new characters though, I mean

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I'm sure we're gonna get new characters

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I think they'll have to be some new characters

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I will bet you, I will bet you there are not

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
New characters in this, I bet you it's just the remake

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Of the first game

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Really? You think they'd be that bold?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I think they'd be that lazy, yes

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I do think that they'd be that lazy

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I hope not

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I'm sorry, I have no

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Optimism in Nintendo anymore

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Oh snap

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Uh, GameGuru seems to

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Kind of have that same skepticism saying I'll wait for

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Reviews before getting Punch Out

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
From our chatroom, chat.orangeandredo.com

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I mean, don't get me wrong, it looks good

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But I just- You know what I say to your skepticism

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Huh

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Fine, say that all you want

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
But it's gonna happen the way I said it

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So, Tigerclaw making an

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Interesting point in chatroom regarding remakes

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
In this whole discussion, kind of talking about

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Hollywood remakes, Tigerclaw says

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Have you heard that Hollywood wants to remake the Never

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Ending story, yes I did hear that this

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Week, and geez Louise

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Come up with a new idea, no

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Exactly, no no no no no

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
You do not remake the Never Ending story

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Cause they weren't that great, I mean they were

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Okay, but the first movie is epic

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
If you're a kid though

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Is that great, it remains epic

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The other two

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
The second one had the guy who played the Flash

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
As the dad

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
It's always why I like that, because I kind of

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Loved that show

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Even though it failed

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
But I can do without a remake

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Come on

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
If you can actually understand her name

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Say my name

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
It won't make a point, you know

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Say my name

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
You never understand what the hell he's saying

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Anyway, forget it

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Couple more stories and we'll get to part B

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Classic Game of the Week coming up as well

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Maybe that's her name, it's foreign

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
What?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So this week to coincide with the movie release

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Xbox Live Arcade

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
PlayStation Network and PC will be

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Getting the Watchmen The End is Nigh

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
The kind of prequels to

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
The whole Watchmen storyline

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And it will be sold for a

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Whopping $20

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Or 1600 Microsoft points

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
On Xbox Live Arcade

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
That sounds a bit expensive to me

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
But it's supposed to be pretty good

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
It's kind of a brawler type game

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
But

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
20 bucks, really?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I'm gonna wait

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
This movie is also not getting some good early reviews

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Although a lot of people

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
There's lots of fanboys with big big boners for Watchmen

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
You know, I'm interested to see it

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
But you know, I don't know

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
It looks okay

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
It looks okay

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I'd see it, but not opening day

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I'd kind of wait and see what some of my friends think about it

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I mean, the story's interesting

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
But it's not like, oh my god, this is the best

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Novel ever, you know, this is the best

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Graphic novel ever, ever

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Cause if that's the best graphic novel

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
That there ever was

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Thank god, graphic novels suck

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I mean, cause seriously

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That is where you're setting the bar

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I don't think so

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Alright, well we'll see

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
One more story for you guys

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And we'll get to the classic game of the week

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And it has to do with EA

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Could EA possibly be making their own music game soon?

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And you might be thinking

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Well, don't they already kind of do rock band?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Well, yeah, but they more distribute a game

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
That Harmonix is making

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Here's the interesting thing

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
EA apparently, it was their chief operating officer

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
John Pleasence

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Made a statement at the Goldman Sachs

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Technology and Internet Conference

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Quote, when we look back five years

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
The fantasy of being a rock star

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
By punching the buttons that are flowing down the screen

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Is going to be one implementation

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
In what is going to be a very large category

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
There are lots of other things you can do with music

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
And we're working on interesting things

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And we know our competition

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Is working on interesting things

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So, what exactly are they working on?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
However, he went on to say

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
We're not in any position to announce anything

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I think it's a robust category

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Over the coming years

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
There will hopefully be lots of things

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
We will do in the music category

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So, could EA be up to something?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Of course they're up to something

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Music games are, you know

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Selling like crazy right now

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Of course they're trying to get another piece of that

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
So, I'm sure they're trying to think of something

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
We have some very interesting music gaming news

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Coming up a little later in part B of our show

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
But first, we're about to our commercial break

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Or, not really commercial break

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
But a free break of music here on Orange LA

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And before we get to that though

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
We're going to get to our classic game of the week

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Because we always like to pay respects

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
To a classic video game here at the end of part A every week

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
So, to do that, DarkSakura

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Is going to dig through the gaming archives

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And find a game that she thinks is worthy

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Of being the classic game of the week

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
The classic game of the week is Parasol Stars

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Which is a fun little game

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Did you ever play Parasol Stars, Rob?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Yes, I did actually

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Parasol Stars is actually the...

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
It's in the series of Bubble Bobble

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
A direct sequel to Rainbow Islands

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Where you basically use your parasols

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
To gather raindrops

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Which you can shoot out at your little enemies

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
You can bop them

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Or you can protect yourself from the enemies

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
With your little parasol

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And it was actually the first one to never have an arcade release

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
It came out on the PC Engine in Japan

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And then we got it thanks to Working Designs

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I never realized it was never an arcade game

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
We got it from Working Designs though

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000
In the US who was responsible for bringing us tons of different

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Really awesome games from Japan

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Like they gave us Ray Earth

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Silhouette Mirage

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Didn't they do Radiant Silver Gun?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I don't remember

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
They were responsible? No

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
But at any rate, it's you know

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Oh yeah, another game that I covered on the show

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Was Brainfart

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Popful Mail

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
But anyway, back to Parasol Stars

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
So yeah, this is a Taito game

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Came out in 1991

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And you play as Bub and Bob

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
But you play as their human counterparts

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Which would be...

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
The same characters from Rainbow Islands

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Yeah, the same from Rainbow Islands, Bubby and Bobby

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
What creative names

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
It was only out on TurboGrafx

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Wasn't it out on Super Nintendo as well?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I could be wrong

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Sorry sorry, my bad

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
So basically Parasol Stars though

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
It was sort of retconned out of their continuity

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Because Bub and Bob got turned back into little dragons

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
For Bubble Symphony and all those

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Bubble Memories and Bubble Symphony

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And so Parasol Stars is considered sort of a side story

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
A guide and a side story

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000
To the whole bubble world

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
You know

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
At any rate, like I said

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
You can get different items

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
You can also

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
You have to collect these star items

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
As you go through that lets you access

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
These other planets

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Because you're basically going through the levels and moving to other planets

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So that you can get all the stuff to save the world

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
So you have 10 rounds on each planet

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And there's a boss on each one

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Except on level 30

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Wait, wrong, sorry

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
But when you get the star items

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
You have access to two other planets

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
One that's around Bubble Bobble

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And one around another game called Jack and Pop

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
They're not available on the main screen

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
You actually have to get stuff to unlock it

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And then

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
You have the final boss

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Who is the one responsible for stealing all the color

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
From the world

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Is like the uber boss of everything

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And so you get the true ending that way

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So like I said

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You gather the drops, you can throw them

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And if you gather like

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Five drops

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Then you can just do the smack down with a big

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Kick ass

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Attack

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
So

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Oh also each of the drops has a different elemental theme

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
So that's pretty cool

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
But yeah

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
As far as I'm aware

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I think this did

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I think it came out on

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
The Amiga

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
If I remember correctly

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
The Atari ST

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
There's a Game Boy version

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
The NES

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I want to say

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
And

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Of course the

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Turbo Graphics 16

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Or PC Engine

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
But yeah I think this came out on the

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
NES

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Which is probably its most notable version

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Is the Turbo Graphics one

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
There you go

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Alright

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
There you go

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Parasol Star is your classic game of the week

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
If you're a fan of Bubble Bobble

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Right in the same series

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
So check that out

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Alright that's going to bring Part A of Orange Lounge Radio

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
For those of you on Justin TV

It looks like we're going to do a little bit of a

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Game look tonight

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
What game are you looking at on Justin TV tonight Loki?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000

This is going to be the game we're looking at on Justin TV

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000

However stay tuned we'll be right back with more of

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Orange Lounge Radio

Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
On this lovely Sunday evening

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
March the 1st of 2009

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Here for our 315th episode

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Which we've been looking at a game

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Here in studio on Justin TV

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Eat Lead

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
How's this game been going for you Loki?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
It's going okay

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I haven't been watching a lot of this on

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Justin TV

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I was running the house during the break

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I was trying to get to a

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Save point real quick

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Did I just die?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I think you did because you turned your back

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
When something was going ahead

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I haven't really been paying attention

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Well I'll pause it for later

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Alright maybe we'll look at it a little more

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Actually no I'm not going to pause it I'm going to quit

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Alright we got some

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
News we're going to get back into here on part B

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
We got to wait for Loki to get set up here

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
So um

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
I don't know how do we kill time at this point

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Loki I need you to

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Be here to start reading news at the top of the show

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
What are we going to do?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Alright we're

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Resetting back up Justin TV if you're joining us

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Here on this Sunday night

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Justin TV slash Orange Launch Radio

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
If you want to see us live

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Taping the show

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
And of course you can always join our chat room as well

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Oh thank you

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Breslull is there in chat and is reminding me

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Of something I wanted to mention at some point during the show tonight

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
That is Orange Launch Radio

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
U.S. All March Madness is going on right now

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And some surprising

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Not ties but some surprising votes

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Going on right now

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Orange Launch Radio U.S. All March Madness

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
If I remember right last time I looked

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Mega Man 2 is beating Ocarina of Time

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Which is certainly a controversial

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Little match up going on right now

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
But what's interesting is that there will be

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Three things in the

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Or three Zelda games in the top eight

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
If um

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
The voting does

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Go in Zelda Ocarina of Time

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Favor because I think right now

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
The Legend of Zelda and

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Link to the Past

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Are both ahead as well

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Could be very interesting

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
How that all plays out

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
So again if you want to participate in that you can go to our forums

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
It will already be down to eight

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
But if you're listening live on this Sunday evening

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
They're at the Sweet 16 right now

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So check that out

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Alright

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Almost done Loki?

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Alright

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
He's just plugging the computer back in getting ready to do

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
The encoding for JustDB

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
You want to do an email real fast?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Sure why not?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Do a preliminary mailbag?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Yes because then that means there will be less to read later

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Alright sure well let's start off with an email

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
I don't have the music though so uh just read an email

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I have to read this because it's super amusing

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
This is an email from Sauce

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Alrighty

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Hey OLR I know you guys are fans of laughing at stupid people

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
So I thought I would share

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
A sad but true story with you

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
To make it video game related

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Imagine Super Mario Brothers music playing in the background

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Uh I might be able to arrange that actually

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Okay

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I'm sorry this is actually so funny that I do want to read it right away

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Okay

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Um on Friday afternoon I was at UNLV

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Heading to my graphic design class

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
From the second floor of the building

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
This hallway is open air

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
You can see the major street

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
In front of the university

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
As I was heading into class

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I witnessed a car accident

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
An old smaller size pickup truck rear-ended

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
An orange new beetle

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
A loud sound

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
So many of my classmates came out of the computer lab to see what had happened

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
As we watched the beetle pulled into the parking lot

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
In front of our building

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
The pickup truck sat there for about a minute

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Without pulling out of the street

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
And then once the beetle's owner had gotten out of his car

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
The truck made a u-turn and sped off down the street

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
We were obviously quite appalled by this

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
But what could be done

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
We realized that none of us had gotten the guy's license plate

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And then one of my classmates shouted down to the beetle driver

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
LOOK

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
And pointed to the street

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And it became over music

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Because in the middle of the street

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Where the accident had occurred

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Laid the front bumper of the truck

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
With the license plate still attached

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
The beetle owner called the police

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And a few of us gave a statement to the police officer

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
About the accident

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
We don't know

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
We don't know why the guy in the truck took off

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Maybe he didn't have insurance

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Or maybe he had outstanding tickets

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
But I'm pretty sure the moral of the story

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Is that if you're going to turn

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
A car accident that you were responsible for

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Into a felony hit and run

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
You might want to make sure that you don't leave

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Any incriminating evidence behind

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Like your bumper and your license plate

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I just wish I could have seen the look on the truck driver's face

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
When he got home and realized he had left his license plate behind

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Cheers, Lauren

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
That was worthwhile

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Alright, now let's get into some gaming news

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
That was a good story

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Loki, yes

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
So

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
There's some interesting stuff

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
We've heard some controversy before

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
About Xbox Live names and

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Profiles, etc. containing

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Different things and getting accounts banned

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Including

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
There was one that someone had made

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
That was to the effect of

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Gay gamer or something like that

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And they got banned because of the word

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Gay in there

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
There was a guy named Richard

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Which was his actual name

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And he ended up getting banned as well

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Because gay was in the name

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Well now we have a self-identified lesbian

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Being banned from Xbox Live

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Because in her

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I guess

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Profile it said that she was a lesbian

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And so

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Apparently

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
That rubbed someone the wrong way

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
So she got banned

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Now of course people

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
All are kind of up in arms

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
About the whole thing and

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Apparently

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Microsoft's Steven Toulouse

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
An Xbox Live team member

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Has made a post on his

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Personal blog regarding the situation

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And they're hopefully going to explore some policy changes

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And also

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I guess Glad is waiting on the story

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
As well, so

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Well, I just

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I'll link it in the chatroom, I blogged about

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
This actually yesterday

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I have choice things to say about

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
The way this was handled

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And I think Inelegant does not

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Even remotely

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Touch what a crying shame it was

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
So

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I won't say more than that

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Basically the whole situation was

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
As Microsoft noted

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
In a statement they said

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
That users may not create a gamertag

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Or use text in any

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Profile field that includes

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Comments that look, sound, like

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Stand for, hint at, abbreviate

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Or insinuate

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Content of a potentially sexual nature

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Profiles that do are asked

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
To change the language and are suspended

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Until changes are made

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And it says, I guess

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
The company also states it does not allow

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Gamertags or profiles to identify any form

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Of sexual orientation

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Which is funny because there's nothing about that in their terms of usage

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Nor their code of conduct

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Nothing

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I read the entire

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Both of them

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
There is not a single thing

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
In the terms of usage

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Or in the code of conduct

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
On Xbox.com

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Nothing, zero

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Zilch

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I don't know, you'd think I'd have a stronger opinion on this

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
You know, being the gay one on the show

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
But I don't know

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I kind of feel it might be one of those unfortunate things

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
There's a lot of these things on blog posts

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
That, you know, kind of take it and run

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Tend to be, I kind of feel like it might be one of those things

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
That's being blown horrifically out of proportion

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Like there just might be something

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Else going on

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I don't know, for all we know

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
For all we know, she could have been

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Doing other questionable stuff on Xbox Live

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
We don't know

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Basically what was going on

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Did you actually read her post on the consumerist?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Yeah, I read all the things on the consumerist

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
But the consumerist is also not

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Widely known for always doing complete research

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
According to other sites

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
But I'm saying from her post

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Yeah, I saw her post

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Well, the thing is that I've seen people on

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Xbox Live do this

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I've seen just, you know, blatant

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Harassment going on

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And, you know, people are like that

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
You know, outside of the virtual environment

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Oh, don't get me wrong

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
That's totally inexcusable

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And should definitely be dealt with

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
But there's no reason why someone

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Shouldn't be able to, I mean

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I actually agree that, you know

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
It shouldn't matter in the end

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
But, you know, if she's

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Proud of it, why not have something

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
In her, you know, what is said

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
On the terms of usage on

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Xbox Live was, and this is

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Item number five, how you may not

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Use the service

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Create a gamertag avatar or use text

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
In other profile fields that may offend

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Other members, that's what it said

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
So basically

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It's, you know

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It can be summarized as

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
The Xbox Live powers

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
That be saying, oh

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Being gay is offensive

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Because they're all offended

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
That you're a lesbian

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
That's

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
How, you know, that's pretty much

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
How it came out as

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I wonder if any of these people that were harassing her

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Were ever dealt with

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
If they were ever punished

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Now see, what's interesting is that in Microsoft's response

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
To this whole thing, they say

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
In the Xbox Live terms of use

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
A member may not create a gamertag or use

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Text in other profile fields that include

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Comments that look, sound like, stand for, hint at

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Abbreviate, or insinuate content

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Of a potentially sexual nature

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Profiles that do are asked to change the language

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
And suspended until changes are made

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
In regard to sexual orientation, for gamertags

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Or profiles we do not allow expression

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Of any type of orientation, be it

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Hetero or other

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
That is not in

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Their terms of usage, in fact

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
It's in terms of use right now

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Could it be, make sure you're looking at Xbox Live

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
And not Xbox.com, because there probably are

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Different ones

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
There's the Xbox Live terms of use, that's what I went to

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
So, hold on, let me find it real quick

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Because, yeah, I'm curious kind of what, you know

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Why they would say this

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
If it's not something, you know

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And I realize they could be kind of blurring what's really there

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And what it is

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Here's what it says

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Create a gamertag, avatar, or use text in the profile fields

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
That may offend other members

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
That includes comments that look like, sound like

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Stand for, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Or relate to any of the following

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Profane words, phrases, topics

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Or content of a sexual nature

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Hate speech, including but not limited to

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Racial, ethnic, or religious slurs

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Illegal drugs slash controlled substances

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Or illegal activities

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It does not say

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Orientation

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
You know, just because

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Just because, you know, if you put on there

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Lesbian, it's not saying

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Um, it's not the same

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
As exactly saying, I like to fuck chicks

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And now

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
If she, because there were people

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
There were people up there

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Who fully had, you know

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Really sexist comments

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
In their profiles, I've seen them before

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
But, you know

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Nothing about orientation

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
These were all, you know, pretty offensive things

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
You know, what happened to them?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Why aren't they banned?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
You know, I don't think

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
That listing your orientation

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Exactly relates to the act of fucking

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Now if she said in there

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Um, I'm a lesbian

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And I like, you know

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Big strap-ons, then I understand

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Just put, I heart scissoring

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Well you're, hey

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I like cutting paper with scissors

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Therefore it's scissoring

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Here's my question

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Is that if they allow her back on the service

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Which is gonna be the inevitable conclusion

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
You know this is what's gonna happen

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Is that Microsoft's gonna have to, you know

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Kinda eat it up on this or whatever

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And let this person back

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Does that mean that Loki could go on and on his profile

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Put, I love lesbians

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
There's nothing wrong with that

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
It's not, you know, slanderous

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Or anything like that, it's just stating

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
What is probably a fact

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Loki, do you love lesbians?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Some lesbians

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I don't really love or hate them

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Let's just assume Loki wants to put

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
His hands on his profile

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
It's like bird watching

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
For the matter of argument

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I don't know

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
But do you see what I mean

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
They did not have anything

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
You know, he said in his comment

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Including, you know, orientation

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
You know, listening to that

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
But nowhere in the terms of usage

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
That is a blatant lie

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Interesting

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
He has lied to the public

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Through MTV News

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
It is in print

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
On not just my own blog

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
But on plenty of news sites now

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Where he is a goddamn liar

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
But, I don't know

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I mean, still

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
It's not like they are talking to

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
GLAAD about the whole thing

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And the human rights

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Or whatever they're called

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
You know, the human rights campaign

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
HRC and all this stuff

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It just seems like if they were that

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
You know, against all this or something

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
You know, in a way

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I'm kind of glad that they're not star star

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Starring it out like Sony does in

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Home

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
It's basically, they have a list

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Of banned words

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
That are considered offensive

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
And yeah, they have to unfortunately

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Cover everything

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Including, you know, homo

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And all that stuff

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And that's why they have the gay in there as well

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Because people use it in derogatory fashion

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And lesbian is in there as well

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
That's on this black list

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
But that's what it is

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And because this person had it in their profile

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
That's why their account was banned

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
It's just like the guy Richard Gaywood or whatever

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
His name is Gaywood, that's his name

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Hers wasn't a random banning

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Hers was banned

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
When she reported

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
The harassment of other people against her

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And they said, oh, well it's because of your

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Profile ban

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
They banned her

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Because other people were offended

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Yeah, I'd agree

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
That's pretty messed up

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
They need to ban other

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
It's just rampant on Xbox Live

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
In some of those games, you know

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
They don't want me as a moderator

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
No

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
You know why they don't want me as a moderator

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I will fuck their shit up

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Seriously

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
They say, and you know, I've even seen

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
People that follow on Twitter, they're like

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Seriously, when you see that stuff

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
You know, the fag, fag, fag, report it

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
They will do something about it

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
So, I don't know

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I do, when I

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
When people annoy me on there, I report it

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I'm a tattle

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Basically what was happening though

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Is all these people are following her from area to area

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
While she's trying to play a game

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
And just do her own thing

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
That's blatant harassment

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Why haven't those people been banned

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I mean, I think that if you go after someone

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
With malicious intent

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Well, here's the question though

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Because we don't know who they are

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I would love to find out

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
But at the same time

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
You know, I think that any kind of

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Malicious act like that

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Should be immediately

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Dealt with, I think that there needs to be

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Some, I think that if

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
You're reported for a malicious act

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Then you need to

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
At least have

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
You know

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Get off my internet

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Like, say an hour suspension

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
So that you're

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
The situation can be reviewed

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Uh, cheeseburger

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
In chat, chat.orangelandradio.com says

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
All hail DarkSakura or ban

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Haha

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Uh, DarkSakura agrees

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Ban the guy they're targeting

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Um

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Yeah

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I don't know, I'm kinda curious to see what ultimately

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Becomes of this, I still feel like it's kinda early on

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I think we'll see more kinda come out of this next week

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And I think we're gonna end up revisiting this topic

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Next week, but in the meantime

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
If you have your own thoughts on it

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
You can give us a call later in the show

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Or you can always send us an email, of course

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
DarkSakura loves emails

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Mailbag at orangelandradio.com

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Uh, well on Xbox Live

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
For those of you that haven't gotten banned from your profiles yet

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
There are some things to look forward to in the future

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Worms Armageddon Decades

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Uh, this is

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Apparently a

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Like, old game, about 10 years old

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
It's coming out previously, what was this on before?

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Like the Nintendo 64, I think, and the PlayStation

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
And PC

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Uh, they're remaking this for Xbox Live Arcade

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Which isn't too surprising when you consider that the original

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Worms is a pretty good seller

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
On Xbox Live Arcade

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
So it's about time for a quote unquote

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Sequel, and that's what this is

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
There you go

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Worms Armageddon, coming out soon on Xbox Live

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
There was so much, my husband

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Played Worms so much

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
It's no Scorched Earth

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Just because I love Worms, it's no Scorched Earth

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
It's cute though

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
But Scorched Earth is hardcore

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Did you play the other game that's like Scorched Earth, sorta?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Uh, no, what's it called?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Death Tanks? No, I haven't played that

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
That's on there, interesting

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I don't know if it's any good, but

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I love Scorched Earth

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Who doesn't love Scorched Earth?

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
That game is awesome

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Cause, it's hot

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Talk about the game, silly pants

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
My pants aren't silly, they're denim

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Moving on

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Back to the Xbox Live Arcade

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Even though they're

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Bastards in charge

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Um, I'm getting

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And this is me specifically

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Getting this, this is for me

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
At least in my own private universe, this is for me

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
One of my favorite

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Ever games

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
According to Famitsu

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Do we know what that is? I'll give you a clue

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
It involved twin sticks

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I have twin sticks for this game

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
By the way, Rob

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Did you know that?

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Somehow I'm not surprised

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Virtual On, Oratario Tangrum

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
And they can't use my twin sticks!

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I actually have the Dreamcast twin sticks

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
You can

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
But you'd have to modify them

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Ugh, no

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
I'll just make a converter

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Um, but yeah

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
It's gonna be on there for

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Uh, 1200 points

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And, oh my god

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I love this game

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Now could you use the twin sticks on like the maim version

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Or something? Do they even have a maim version?

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
There's a maim version, but

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
You have to have like the

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I think you do have to

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Play it with twin sticks

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Cause they're twin analog

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Yeah

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I don't know, I want one of these cabinets in my house

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Because this game is fucking sexy

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Did Michael Jackson have one of these?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Huh? Did Michael Jackson have one of these for sale?

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I don't know

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I didn't look

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Honestly though

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
There's only one more game really

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Other than this that I would want to have a deluxe cab of

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
But

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
You probably can't guess what it is

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Planet Harrier

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
But um

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Anyway, but yeah

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
It's robot on robot action

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Ooh kinky, but seriously

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
It's um, just beat em up

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
At the end of the game, and I actually

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Have, um, Dan and I have two clocks

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
That Sega released

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I have one of the Fayen, and then we've got

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
One of the last boss

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
The annoying bitch that he is

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Get the game

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Um

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Well there's another game that you won't have to actually pay for

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
That will be coming to

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Well actually you may have to pay for this one

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Um

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Quake 3 Arena for Xbox Live Arcade

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Is close to being finished

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And apparently this was first

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Spotted as an ESRB link

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Uh, a leak

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Actually I do remember the leak, I think this was around E3 even

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Last year

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
And um

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Apparently it's um

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Looking pretty good, and that kind of makes sense

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
You know with some of the other Quake themed stuff

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
That was um, or coming soon so

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Um

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Neat

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
You know speaking of Quake, I tried to get into Quake Live this week

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
And I see people talking about that in chat right now actually

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Um, it looks like Hitstun's looking for people to play

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Quake Live with, but I could not get past that queue

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Cause you know the day it was announced

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Thousands of people in the queue because everybody was

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Uh, probably getting thrown to it

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
From different blog sites, but you know

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I went back earlier today to try to check it out

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
And the queue was only 35 people

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Which sadly I didn't have time to wait

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Again because um, I had to do

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
This show tonight, but I'm gonna try and check it out a little

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Later on tonight, but in looking at the demo videos

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
And stuff, it looks kinda awesome

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I'm very curious to see if it plays

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
As well as it's advertised

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
It should limit everybody to one life, and then that way the queue will go faster

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Maybe, I don't know, no I mean

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
You know it's gonna get hammered the first day

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
But it looks like it's eased up quite a bit

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Cause the queue was only 35, that wouldn't have been that bad

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
You know I've seen WoW queues that were worse than that

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
But um, yeah

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
I guess right now, right this second there's no queue

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
So some of our listeners might be off to play that

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Um, but I will probably check that out a little later tonight

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
So, we'll see

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Um, and I would definitely

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Check out Quake 3 Arena when it hits Xbox Live

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
That was one of my favorite Quake games, was the third one

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
There's a lot of games like that that are coming out

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
There's also that, um, other

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Uh, god I don't remember the name of it now

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
But it was the one that they had

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
With the geophysics processor at one time

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Um, that game

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Uh, whatever

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
It's some psychic war game that's gonna be coming out

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
And then I think there's another game

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Very similar to that as well, that's supposed to be on its way

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
So a lot of those arena, unreal

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Type of tournament stuff

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Coming out for Live Arcade

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Makes sense because everybody

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Loves first person shooters on the 360, you know

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Mhmm

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Uh, also big on the 360 soon

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Will be Sam and Max, the first two

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Seasons of Sam and Max are on their way

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
To Xbox Live Arcade, that's right

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Sam and Max Save the World

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Is the name of episode one, or season one

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
And Sam and Max Beyond Time

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
and Space season two, they are on their way

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
To Xbox Live Arcade

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Uh, which is good because this will really expand the audience

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
So previously these games were only available on PC

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I think a lot of people played them through GameTap

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Um, I think they made their way to the Wii

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Eventually, with the strong pack games

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Uh, season one did

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So, but finally they're gonna be making their way to Xbox Live Arcade

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
And this is where people will actually be able to download a demo

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Because demos are mandatory on the Xbox Live games

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I think you'll probably finally see

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
These games start to get a lot more of the

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Attention it deserves, at least from the console people

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I mean, I know a lot of PC gamers have already found their way to it

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Uh, but this is gonna open it up

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
To a whole new audience

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Good news, and kind of expected in a way

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
You kind of figured this was gonna happen eventually

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
So, there you go

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Sam and Max coming soon to Xbox Live Arcade

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Well, I have some interesting news

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Oh really?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Has to do with the ESRB

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
More leaks?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Yep, classic rock track for rock band

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Um, isn't that kind of cool

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
It's supposed to be getting a teen rating

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And uh, it's actually on there for violent swearing and drug use

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
So

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I think it's just that song pack that they're gonna put out of all previously released

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:11.000
They're saying The Joker, Take the Money and Run, and Holiday in Cambodia by the Dead Kennedys

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Oh yeah, that's already there

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Yeah, it sounds like it's gonna be like the rock band track pack one or whatever that is

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Those were examples that were given about pretty much kind of the same thing to expect

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Gotcha

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Too bad they don't have independent achievements

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
That would make it a lot more worthwhile

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000
You know, I wonder if that ACDC rock band game's really fallen in price yet

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I'll get it when it's in the bargain bin

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
But I don't want to pay like

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
It's all live tracks too, it's kind of like ehhhh

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I'll check it out just for, you know, because I'm an achievement whore

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
And the fact that, you know, I don't mind increasing my rock band library

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
There's a couple good ACDC songs

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000
But, um, you know, I'm not gonna get it until it's in the $5 bin

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Which you know it will be in Walmart eventually

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And when it's in the $5 bin, you buy it, you dump the songs to your hard drive

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
And then you sell that shit back

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
There you go

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
There you go

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Now you're talking

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
That's how we do it

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
This is how we roll

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
This is how we roll

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Yeah, some other stuff that's interesting for Rock Band 2

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000
The UK's finally getting a few different versions of Rock Band 2

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Apparently the 360 version was on its exclusive kick over there as well

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Now Rock Band 2 will be coming to the Playstation 3 and Playstation 2

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
On March 27th in the UK

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000
And will be coming to the Wii on April 24th as well

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:38.000
And of course these will be available in their bundles, I believe

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000
And, or actually maybe just game only right now

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:46.000
And then there's also gonna be the standalone stuff as well

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
And then I guess they are doing a bundle with the instrument edition

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Which will include the drums, guitar, and microphone

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I just wanna say, Unfolded Raptor in chat following up with the Rock Band thing we were talking about just a minute ago

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:01.000
I saw the ACDC at Walmart for $20 in the bargain bin, Rob

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Some bargain, I agree

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000
That's not that much down from the original asking price, right?

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Yeah

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
But speaking of bargains, Hitstun reminds us that Lost Planet on the PC is $5 this weekend

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
On Steam

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000
And that was a deal I was thinking about checking out

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
But then again, I never really cared for the demo, it's just not my kind of game

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I understand why people like Lost Planet, but it's not my kind of game

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I'm thinking about going back and playing Dead Rising again

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Oh yeah, Dead Rising is fun, I wish I had multiplayer, I hope they do that in the second one

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
It'll be much fun

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
They will, I'm sure

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
They've got to

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Alright, so hooray for the UK finally getting Rock Band

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Well in other Rock Band news, obviously there was a lot of Playstation news this week at Destination Playstation

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
This sounds pretty awesome

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Rock Band Unplugged is a game that's going to be coming out for the PSP

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
It's a rock band on a portable console

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Very interesting when you consider where did Guitar Hero go?

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
The DS

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
But now you have Rock Band coming out on the PSP

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
But guess what?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
There's not going to be any type of guitar attachment or drum attachment or anything like that

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:05.000
No, apparently a website named Primotek apparently has some details about what the gameplay could be like

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Take this with a grain of salt

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Some of this sounds a little bit like fanboy wank to me

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
This could be the real deal

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000
I think it's the stuff from Destination Playstation probably

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Well also kind of thinking back a couple weeks ago when they were, well let me get to that in a minute

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Here's some of the possible gameplay details from this

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Apparently you're going to be using the left, up, triangle and circle buttons to control instruments

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And you also will go from instrument to instrument with the shoulder buttons

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
And then what you do, you play a segment of a certain instrument to get the score or the multiplier going

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And then you switch to a different instrument

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Hmm, what game am I describing?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Frequency and amplitude anybody?

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And remember a couple weeks ago there was that guy who made the statement about

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Oh we'd love to revisit frequency or amplitude someday when the opportunity presents itself

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.000
If you kind of, you know, tie that in with this, this definitely seems like a possibility

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
And a pretty good idea for a game

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
And one I would definitely pick up

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000
This is like frequency and amplitude and that stuff, I'm all over this game

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
All over it

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
So hooray to that, and I know a lot of music game fans are very happy about that

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Are you a big music game fan in frequency and amplitude, Dark Sakura?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Does this sound like something you might play?

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Maybe

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Again, songs are everything

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
You know, that's one other thing to keep in mind

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Is that if the song list sucks, then forget it

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
However if MTV Games is involved, I'm sure they will be able to get the artist they need

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.000
So I would be far more interested in this than the Guitar Hero one

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Because what I like, what kind of the difference is

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Is that Guitar Hero DS was like

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:46.000
How do we take the Guitar Hero game on the 360 and on the, you know, Nintendo Wii

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
And smush it down into a DS

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Where this is, okay how do we build a band

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Or how do we build a game in the rock band genre on this platform

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Knowing that these are our restrictions

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Go

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
You know, I think that they're taking a completely different approach to it

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I think will help them create the better game

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
But we'll see

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000
We shall soon see

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Well how about More Stuff?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
More Stuff, my favorite

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.000
For iPhone people, there are actually two titles that are out by Taito

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
And no, they're not bubble wobble

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
The first is Cooking Mama

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Where you can use the accelerometer and play your game

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
It's for $6.99 or 5 pounds, 5.5 euro

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
There's also Space Invaders

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Where it's tilt and you can drag and you can use touch screen

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
And there's bonus character art and stuff

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
And it's like 5 bucks

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
So cool

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Neat

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I'm getting a little, I don't know

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I'm getting a little sick of all the, let's take our existing things

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And push them down into the iPhone

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
I'm putting on Try Cooking Mama

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Good point for MacDeft and Chad

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
It's not Space Invaders Extreme

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
I'm a little, you know, I'm a little worn out on the old school Space Invaders

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
If it was Space Invaders Extreme with the awesome soundtrack

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Which the iPhone would be a good platform for

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I would be all over that, but

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Doesn't sound like it

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Oh well

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Prince of Persia, the epilogue download content

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Was supposed to have been out already

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
But it's been delayed to March 5th

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Not that long of a wait though

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
The price has been announced at $10

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
And of course this game

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
It will pick up from the end of the game

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.000
And hopefully make up I guess for what was apparently

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
A crappy ending, I don't know

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I never really played to the end of Prince of Persia

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Actually I didn't get to the end either

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Didn't really play Prince of Persia, but

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I probably played a little more than you

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
It was a good time, but I just got distracted

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Well you definitely played more than me because I didn't touch it at all

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Oh well there you go

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
It's fine, you should pop it in and check it out

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
It's a fun game

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
You gave it to me, it was a good game

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
But um

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Yeah

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Easy achievements if you kept the 360 version

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
I have the PS3 one

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
So it's trophies, but still

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Same idea, right?

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Well once again it's just too many games coming out

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
I don't have enough time to play them all

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Oh well

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Well I'm one of those weird people that has a Netflix account

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And I hardly ever use it

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
So it's like just a vacuum sucking my money away

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Because I never watch the movies that they send me

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
But one thing I do love about Netflix

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Is the streaming Netflix

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
One thing I like about the streaming

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Versus the DVDs or Blu-ray through the mail

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Is that you don't have to wait for streaming

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
If you want to watch something you can watch it right now

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
You don't have to wait for a disc to be delivered to you

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So I love the Xbox 360 streaming

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And I'm loving some of these rumors I'm hearing this week

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Apparently Netflix is planning on a streaming only subscription

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
In the foreseeable future

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
This comes from a report from Reuters

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Which is one of the massive news reporting agencies

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Along with Associated Press

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
So yeah this sounds like it's coming in the future

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
No word if they're going to expand the amount that's offered on the streaming subscription

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Because sadly there isn't a lot available right now

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I mean there's some good like NBC TV shows

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
And you know there's some indie movies

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
And random ass documentaries

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Are available on the service

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
But they don't have a lot of new news stuff you know

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
So it could use a little buffing up

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
But who knows

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Apparently Netflix is considering launching a streaming only plan

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000
But no word on exactly how much that's going to cost

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Apparently Netflix just exploded in the amount of usage of the streaming movie service

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
In the last few months

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
No doubt from the 360 Netflix app

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Which earlier was reported they have what a million people using it

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
So there you go

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Hopefully it won't be that expensive

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Apparently you know maybe I should just downgrade my plan to the $8.99 plan

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Because right now I think I have like the $12 plan

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000
So I should at least just download the one movie a month plan

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Or one disc at a time, four movies a month or whatever it is

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Because I just never watch the movies they send

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
I just never get around to it

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Like I'm always in the mood for something else by the time I get the movie

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I'm just that impatient I don't know

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Alright anyhow let's take a trip into the old mailbag

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Darkstalker read one letter a little bit ago

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
But now we're going to officially open up the mailbag

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
For your emails at mailbag.orangelawandtrader.com

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Darkstalker is going to pick out a few of her favorite emails

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
And read them for you right now

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.000
I get a ton of emails so I'm not going to be able to read all of them

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000
But did you lose a sock so do you like Dan?

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Dan was very popular on the show

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I saw some twits about it too and all that so

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Jenai from Las Vegas actually

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Oh god stupid thing

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Sorry my plug keeps falling on my laptop

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
I would like to say episode 312 was hilarious

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Dan and Loki's commentary made me fall out of my suit laughing while at work

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Dan needs to be on the show more often he's got a great radio voice too

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I love the new LLR website layout it has a nice citrus look to it

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Peace slot machines and sugar cookies Jenai

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
You know I had an offer to go to Vegas in June

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000
And you know I can't go because it's the same week as E3

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Damn it

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I really want to go back to Vegas though I will make that happen this year

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Well there's just some really really long emails

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:21.000
The next one comes up from AcidicVampire

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Hello there OLR this is Paul aka AcidicVampire with my virginal email to you guys

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm a fairly new listener

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Been listening since August of last year

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
That I enjoy the show immensely

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
History between all three hosts the terrific news

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And Loki's disdain for every Imagine game released each week has sold me as an avid listener

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Imagine hate

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Now that my saccharine praise is out of the way I do have a valid question

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Now I've only heard Sky mention that he has played this game before

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000
But if DarkSakuraLoki has played this as well I wouldn't mind their input

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
After years of being released I am finally going to attempt to play Final Fantasy XI

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
For some odd reason I've been reading about it lately

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
And I've always put it aside as being one of those games I just had to play

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan Final Fantasy VI for the win

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:14.000
But I said cast Final Fantasy XI aside because it was online and required a monthly fee to play

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Well I bought the Vanadium collection recently for about 20 bucks

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Which includes all four expansion packs and I'm ready to get my feet wet and get my Ferraga on

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:28.000
This will be my first MMORPG which I fear will exile me from other players on the servers

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Because of my inexperience which leads to this question

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.000
What tips can you give a noob MMORPG player like me?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.000
I like to play a Taru Taru Black Mage because they're so damn cute

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
But I know it'll take forever to level them up

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I also like to interact with other players but I don't want them excited on me just because I'm new to the game

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
They've been playing the game for five plus years

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Any input you have

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I'm sorry

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Any input you or even the chat room can give me would be greatly appreciated

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Thanks for your time and here's to another 300 shows

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Gay gamers unite

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I'll leave that to you, I played but I didn't like it

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Yeah, turn around and run while you still can

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Do not allow yourself to get sucked into this game

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
No, you know what, I've heard a lot's changed since the time I left

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:16.000
You know what, Loki actually, Loki did spend just as long as I did in the clutches of Vanadil if not a little longer

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
I don't know, Loki, what was your thoughts?

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
I liked it, it was fun

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:30.000
It sucked waiting for parties and now that they've fixed the having to party with people

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
I think that would be a lot more fun now

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000
That was kind of the thing that broke it for me is, well other than that I didn't have time to play

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Is just waiting for a party and you're like, okay I have two hours to play this

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.000
And of that two hours you're spending an hour and 45 minutes waiting for a party

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
And it's like by the time you're, it's like crap I don't have time to play anymore

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Well 15 minutes of a party yay

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Or you know someone else leaves and you have to wait for a party

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Yeah I feel like I heard they changed a lot of very fundamental things about the game

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Including the whole level sync thing that like I can't give this a fair shot

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
You know cause I could sit here and bitch about every reason why I left it

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
But I'm not giving the game a fair shot because they've addressed some of those issues

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
You know the economy was the biggest thing for me

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I thought it was absolute bullshit that if you wanted to get anywhere in the economy of the game

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.000
You pretty much had to buy gold because they were refusing to do anything about the, or Gil or whatever

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
They were refusing to do anything about the Gil sellers in the game

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:30.000
But about three, four months after I left they finally started banning people for it

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
And they were pretty aggressive about it

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Now granted you'll never eliminate it but I'm sure that's helped the economy tremendously in that game

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Because the Gil sellers were ruining the game

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000
But it's just unfortunate the Square let it go on so long

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000
You know they didn't, kind of weren't, you know they lost some people like me

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Because they just weren't more aggressive with it

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000
So I don't know, I feel like I can't give the game a fair review

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000
But dude you already bought the pack, it comes with a free month of the game

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Go install it, have a blast, go play for that month

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I'm almost curious to see how it would run on my PC now

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Yeah I know, I bet it would look nice

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
But I don't know, you know one thing I prefer

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I'll tell you something, to be fair I'll tell you something I prefer on Final Fantasy 11 compared to WoW

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I like exploring in Final Fantasy 11 a lot more

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And it's weird because the graphics aren't necessarily better

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000
They're just a different type

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
And like when you go into a new world in Final Fantasy 11

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Like a place you've never been before

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
It's like oh wow, it's scary as shit

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Yeah sometimes it's scary as shit

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Like especially the first time you're in Gunga mines and you hear the sirens go off

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
You're like what the fuck is that?

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.000
But you know, like Final Fantasy 11 you really get a sense of exploration in that game

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And like just the world is so vast in that game

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000
And it's not that WoW doesn't have its own neat levels and areas and things like that

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
But I don't know, there's something about Final Fantasy 11

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Where I feel more sense of an accomplishment when it comes to exploring

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
WoW takes itself more seriously I think

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Versus, you know, or not WoW takes

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Final Fantasy 11 takes itself more seriously than WoW

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:59.000
So, hitstun asked in chat so what happened to make WoW suck now

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Actually WoW doesn't suck

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
I don't have a problem with WoW at all

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000
But I just had to quit because I just was spending too much time on it

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Or take a vacation, I don't want to say I quit

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Because that makes it sound like I'm never going to go back

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
And that's not the case, I'm actually probably going to go back pretty soon

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000
But I just needed a break to do other things

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
So, hooray

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Alright, next email then

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Next email

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Hey O.L.R. I have a request for the new Gamestop hate board

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000
They don't sell classic games or system anymore

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I was too young when they did and I got into classic gaming

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
They send them off to the warehouse to gather dust

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000
So F you to Gamestop for lack of classic video games

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
How dare they call themselves a game store, that's from Cheeseburger

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Good suggestion

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Unfortunately the white board is down for repairs right now

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
But we will definitely add that when it comes back

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Alright, one from Spassinator and then I'm going to read the long long one after that

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Alright

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Hi folks, I'm writing in today with a few questions and comments

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Firstly, although perhaps not a big deal

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.000
But I'll address it anyway

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
I'd like to apologize for the mess of an email that it sent last week

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
With the poor grammar and spelling, don't worry about it

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
I'm giving a hard time

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Normally I take the time to make sure everything is correct

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
But considering that I was typing in a hurry

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
And the fact that play online has no spell check

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
And the fact that my glucose levels were out of whack at the time

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Side note, I'm diabetic and abnormal

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Glucose levels cause me to get confused

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
But I'll end up being a factor in the issue

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I really, I give everybody a hard time

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
It's not serious

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
She's an equal opportunity offender

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Oh, bite me

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Now that issue's out of the way, here's a few questions

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
One, can you recall any events in your lives or wow moments

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
That basically you had

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000
You think to yourself something along the lines of yes, video games is a hobby

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000
That I want to get into

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000
For me it's the first time I set foot into a showbiz pizza place

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Formerly a competitor of Chuck E. Cheese's

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000
They're actually owned by Pizza Time Entertainment

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
That was started by

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Fuck

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I don't think it was started by fuck

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Nolan Bushnell

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
I just want to let you suffer a little bit before I help you

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.000
It was going to my friend's house

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
No shit, cause I was little in indie games

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I was born playing video games practically

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:24.000
I just played a lot of Odyssey 2 when I was little little

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.000
And I never thought about wow, I'd like to do this as a hobby

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
It just sort of happened

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:38.000
I was a little kid when all of this was new and interesting

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
But it was just more like

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Hey look, mom brought home a clique-o-vision, that's cool

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Oh, I'm going to go play kicks during break at school

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.000
It just didn't factor in as a wow

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
It was a part of my life, always

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Not a big deal

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Rob?

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I'm sorry, what are we answering?

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000
What was your wow, I really like video games?

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
What got you into video games pretty much?

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Oh god

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I'm almost in the same boat

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I just remember the day we hooked up the Atari 2600

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Just the fact that I was interacting with it

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
No, it really was the Commodore 64

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I think, that really got me into games

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
I don't know, the games

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I can't remember a single moment because I was so young

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.000
You don't remember a lot when you're 4 or 5

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
But I've just always been playing Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 games

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And just been having a good time with the game

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.000
You know, maybe, I don't remember Dark Sakura's upbringing stories

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
But I know in my particular situation

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
My brother and sister are much older than I am

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
14 years and 16 years older than I am

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
So I was kind of an only child, not really

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
But one reason I played video games is because

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I didn't have other kids to set up and play board games with

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Or, you know, go out and play on the lawn with

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I mean, granted, I had neighborhood friends and stuff

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
They don't want to hang out every day

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
So, you know, video games were a way to pass time

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
You know, it would entertain me

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
There were not always a lot of other people around

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
If that makes sense

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
So, Loki, anything for you?

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Why are you into video games?

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I don't know, because I always played video games

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I know, it's tough

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I don't want to say, it's just a tough question

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
There's nothing, really

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Just having video games from like when I was 4 or 5

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
You know, that pretty much

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
That'll do it

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
So there you go

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
You look at the stuff you did when you were a little kid

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
You end up looking at it now

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
And you're doing the same stuff

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
You know, I liked tinkering with things

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
And playing video games

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
And messing around on a computer

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
And sure enough, I'm doing the same damn stuff now

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.000
We were just all born with a controller in our hand, apparently

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
So there you have it

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Alright, now for the long, long, long, long, long email

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Actually, there's more of this, sorry

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
I think I'm just going to post the long email

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
On the forums again, sorry for the cop-out

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
My throat hurts

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
So I'll finish this one

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Have you ever played any memorable games that are so incredibly bad

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
In a weird sort of way that ended up being good?

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Yes

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Driver 3

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Driver 3 is the best, worst game ever

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
It's just so bad

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
In fact, I was talking with my sister yesterday

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
About that, and she's like, I gotta go back and play Driver 3 again

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.000
She would basically just play the game

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Drive around, do like stupid shit

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
And then watch the replay

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Because the best part about it

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
The game was so glitchy anyways

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
That the replays were funny

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
But sometimes the replays would even glitch out even more

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
So your character would do really crazy stuff

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
But yeah, Driver 3

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Absolutely a horrible game

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
That's funny to play

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
That don't shit your pants game was pretty bad, but funny

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
That was the one I played on Flash

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
That was the one I played on Flash

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Logie had mentioned last week

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
I don't know, I can't think of a lot of console games that I go

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Wow, that game was bad

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Bejeweled

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
But yeah, I love Bejeweled

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
But Bejeweled's not a bad game, it's a great casual

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Well, no, it's like Tetris

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
It's like a puzzle game, it's not a bad game

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Did you see that they're bringing Bejeweled Twist to DS?

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Yeah, but I'll be more interested when Bejeweled Twist is free to play on the website

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Like all the other games

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Also, I will get Pagle on Xbox Live Arcade

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
When it comes out

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Definitely, definitely

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
But right now it's all about Bejeweled Blitz on Facebook

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
But nobody else, I have the shitty team score

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Because nobody else plays every week like me

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
But I try to get a new score every week

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
So

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
If you do play, you should add me on Facebook

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Because I need a higher team score, so there you go

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Well, um

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
The third part of this email

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Yep

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
In your opinion, what are the odds of releasing Final Fantasy

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
11 for

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
one or more of the current gen systems

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
I know they're really big on re-releasing

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
the other Final Fantasy games

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
So are they re-releasing Final Fantasy 7

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
So re-releasing Final Fantasy 7 should be a no-brainer

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Although not everyone

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
may agree on this

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Final Fantasy 7 is possibly

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
the most popular, I think it meant

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
re-releasing Final Fantasy 7

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Because I was gonna say, 11's already on 360

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Final Fantasy 7 is probably the most popular

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
memorable game of the series

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
So re-releasing that game would seem like a virtual

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
license to print a shit ton of money

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Who wouldn't want free money, you know

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Well thanks for reading and answering this email

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Sorry it's so long

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Um

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I'd play it

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
I'm kinda torn

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Yes they should, but I'd rather they just freakin' finish

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Final Fantasy 13, like I'm also interested

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
in some of the new directions that Final Fantasy

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
is going. I wish they would have released

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Final Fantasy 12 on the Playstation 3

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
and not the PS2, because I never finished it on PS2

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
And I think if it had

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
been on the newer consoles, I would have

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
probably spent more time with it. I know that seems so

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
silly, but that's what it is

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
So

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
There you go, I don't know, Loki you think they ought to re-release 7?

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
No

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
It's a classic the way it is. I think they do need

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
to just put it out on the download thing already

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
on Playstation Network

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
That I think they need to do

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Um, just wait until 13 comes out

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
they may do that

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Yeah, I could see that

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
But then again, why wouldn't you at least do it a couple months

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
in advance so people can play through Final Fantasy 7

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
before 13 comes out?

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Because it doesn't tie really

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
with each other, it's just a really

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
uber Final Fantasy game that

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
goes along with another uber Final Fantasy game

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Well you know there is that whole, and GameGuru

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
says this in chat, hopefully if not a remake they put it on

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
PSN or Steam, kind of the same thing I'm thinking of

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
The last remnant of course we heard is coming

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
to Steam, which implies the whole Square

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
partnership with Steam now. Hopefully

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
they will release some of the old PC classics

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
on Steam, but we'll see

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
I don't know, I'm not going to hold my breath

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Didn't Eidos

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
put them out? Didn't Eidos

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
do the ports for PC?

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
I could be wrong, I didn't play them

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Slightly better

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
graphics, eh, I don't know

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Not sure if I want to play these

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Last email? Yes

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
This one's long. Alright

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Dear Rob, Jamie, and Matt, I've been

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
a long time listener of your show and counted among my favorites

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
In fact, when you do miss

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
a show infrequently as it is

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
leaves me feeling out of place

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
as if I've gone to work wearing just one sock

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Your unique mixture of news commentary

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
and charm are an important part of my week

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
This is my first letter to you, so I thought

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
I'd start out by thanking you all

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
thanking

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
you for all you've provided during the years

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
As an older gamer like yourselves

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I'm not older, okay, I'm kidding

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Maybe a little

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
I understand the difficulty in trying to balance work, family

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
and the passion we feel for our hobby

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Add a weekly show with

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
pre and post production on top of that and I'm amazed

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
you've been at it for as long as you have

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Anyway, enough of me gushing

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
So are we!

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
But no, thank you, that means a lot

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Recently I came across a comment made by

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
John Kohler, head of Sony PSP hardware marketing

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
in North America, which suggested that

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
the majority of Nintendo DS's

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
are purchased

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
by or for 12 year olds

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Obviously this was meant to insult the DS

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
handheld fan base

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
But that aside, how much of the

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
statement is true?

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
It's up for data on Nintendo demographics

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
as they break down by age group and have a hard time

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
finding any recent results

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Most comments are anecdotal, with an equal number

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
of people saying they see

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
more PSP's to DS's

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
among their above

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
12 age group, as exist folks

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
insisting there are more DS's

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
in their circle. The closest I

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
came to anything was an article on

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
GayGamer.net

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
from 2007, reporting that

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
according to the NPD

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Nintendo had increased their sales figure among women

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
by 42%, 127%

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
among people who age 30

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
and older, and 212%

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
among people 35 and older

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
I don't know if that's just for the

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
month of April or if it was since the last study

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
had been made. I know

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
maybe this really isn't that big of a

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
deal, but I'm curious to know if these

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
assertions have any factual base

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Kohler's claim just doesn't seem right to me

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
completely disagree with Kohler

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
I think that, you know, I see

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
more people who have

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
DS's than they do

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
PSP's. Now I'm seeing

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
more guys in their

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
early 20's who have PSP's

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
that I will say, but

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
you get it 25 and up

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
you know, and you get kids and

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
all kinds of, I think more people

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
and more families

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
have a DS

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
that's how I see it, like

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
my brother and sister-in-law

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Dan's brother and sister

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
they each have their own DS

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
so, I mean

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
now they're little, but then again

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
you know, my

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
you know, I know tons of people who

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
are my age, you know, back

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
you know, where I'm from, who all have

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
DS's, you've got

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
well, you don't have PSP DS

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
No, I own both. I bought a PSP when they first came out

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Luminous. I was all about Luminous. I bought a

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
PSP just for Luminous, practically. But I know

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
that all of us in this room

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
own both

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Dan and I each have our own DS

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
We're a little different too

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
We're crazy, but I would say you're right

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
I think generally, you see

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
the college boys probably have the PSP

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
and are using it, you know, as their multi-device

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
which is what the PSP does best, like MP3's and all that stuff

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
but, so like, if you were to look at

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
demographics, like different

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
demographics, I bet if you looked at the sales figures

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
like males age 18 to

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
24 who own a PSP and DS

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
it's probably a little closer

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
to even, I bet DS still outdoes it though

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
it's probably a lot closer to even

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
than any other demographic you look at

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
but when you look at things as a whole, especially

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
with the DS aggressively targeting women

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
the way it has been with the

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
lifetime commercials, Carrie Underwood

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
pink DS's, all this stuff

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
you know, and as much as you want to

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
point and laugh at these Imagine games

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
and the cats and all this stuff, it works

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
they're selling, or they wouldn't

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
make them, you know, they're

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
just selling to your little sister

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
or, you know what I mean, they're just not

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
selling to people that probably listen

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
to this show, if that makes sense

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
so, you know

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
it's working, but

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
the PSP does not have a lot

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
for that

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
same casual

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
I don't eat, live, sleep, breathe

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
games, but I like to enjoy a game once in a while

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
market, there's not a lot of

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
great puzzlers, casual games

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
outside of Luminous, the movie

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
thing didn't work out so well

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
so unless you have somebody that really wants

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
that all in one system, and I don't know

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
if you held up, like if I

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
were a parent, you know, who didn't know better

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
and you held up a PSP

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
and you held up a DS and said which is more

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
durable for my seven year old child

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
I would go with the DS because it

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
closes and it protects the screen, the PSP

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
just looks flimsier

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
that makes sense, and sometimes

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
it's little things like that

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
that sell the system

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
you'd be surprised

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
there's more

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
me

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
they actually said, I should add that I'm a DS

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
owner over 12

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I do not own a PSP currently, but would

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
eagerly buy one should any of the rumors

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
regarding the PSP2 second analog stick

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
be realized

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
I own both a 360 and a PS3

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
and enjoy them equally

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
in an ideal world, all three companies will do well

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
and continue to provide quality entertainment for the gaming

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
public, so what do you think

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
in this comment just so much as Claptrap or is it

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
or is he right, and must all

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
adult DS owners hang their heads in

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
shame for being attached to a kiddie

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
system, I obviously say that in jest

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
as long as the games are fun

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
what does it really matter, how much fun can

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
we have even with a Speak and Spell bottle of vodka

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
and grown up vocabulary

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
hey, I'm not gonna say I

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
don't know

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
in closing

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I want to add that I like the new site

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
design, it's been a long time coming

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
but it looks sweet and seems to load

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
faster than the old one

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
nice decision to keep the

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
orange background too, if I have a

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
complaint it's that the episodes on iTunes seem

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
to be a week or two off

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
last week's episode was from February 8th

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
does that mean that this week's show will be available March 16th

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
or later, no it's getting caught up

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I was having some problems because now

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
when I do a podcast I have to do it in

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
two different places as opposed to before

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
so it was just confusing me a little bit

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
but I'm good now, I got

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
another one up today and another one

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
is edited and ready to go and then we'll be all caught up

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
so I'm excited

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
and I know I keep saying we're all gonna get caught up

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
but then the new site kind of threw that all out of whack

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
but it's a good thing, I mean overall

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
it's a great thing, so and we're

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
getting back on track

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
um, did I already

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
yeah, okay

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
well keep up the good work

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
in the meantime, loyal listener Raymond

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
PS, I too quit WoW after

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
two years, one level 80

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
two level 70s

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
I don't regret the time

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I spent there but the opportunities are now open to me

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
to experience all

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
different kinds of gaming from Dragon Quest 5 to

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Flower to Gears of War 2, it was liberating

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
and daunting, that's an interesting combination

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
so many new games

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
so many old games to catch up on

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
and only so many hours available in the day, I'm still

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
open to MMOs though, maybe one of the

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
superhero games or the Star Wars one will

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
entice me back, it all depends on the community

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
play Star Trek with us!

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
You know, um, that closing

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
statement is pretty much essentially

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
the reason, one of the big reasons why I

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
quit WoW right there, is that it's now

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
allowed me to play other games

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
you know what I mean?

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Same type of deal dude, I probably would never

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
play Flower or some of these other games I've been playing

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
if I had a raid to do

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
tonight, you know what I mean? So

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
yep

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I just don't want to be tied

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
to an MMO the way I'd be tied

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
to like, my job

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
exactly, exactly, and I don't think

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
you know, it's not like I was in one of those guilds

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
I was in a very very casual guild, but I was

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
I was being too aggressive with the raiding and stuff

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
and I just needed to cut back

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
you know, and just keep WoW as a casual game like

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
others, make WoW like

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Bejeweled basically, alright

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
if you want to send an email, mailbag

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
at orangeloungeradio.com is the place

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
to do it, we're going to take your calls in

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
just a little bit, but first we have a few more

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
quick stories for you guys, and then we'll get

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
to the Skype line and

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
get towards closing out our show

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
for tonight, so Loki!

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
There is some new download content

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
for a rather old Command & Conquer

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
game, Command & Conquer Generals

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
is getting a brand

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
new download

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
pack, I guess it's

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Black Sheep, The Lost Mission

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
and

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
it's

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
interesting that this game

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
you know, it's from like 2003

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
and they're doing some download content

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
for it now

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
didn't even know they were still

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
working on that game

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
might have been something that just wasn't quite done

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
and then they're just like, okay let's finish this

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
and go

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
but yeah, it's available to download now

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
very small download, so

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
check it out I guess

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
basically the mission, you're giving

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I guess, given the command of a

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
toxin attractor

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
it's a modified farm vehicle

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
that sprays

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
icky green stuff

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
and you're

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
supposed to crop dust a town

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
that's been corrupted beyond salvation

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
huh, it's interesting

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
they're releasing download content for such an old game

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
though, but it's still popular, I mean, yeah, right

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
it's like Starcraft still getting patches

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
all these years later

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
well there's still a lot of people playing it, I don't know about

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Command & Conquer Generals, but that's neat

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
you know what I have an odd urge

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
to play, like I was just feeling

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
this the other day, Diablo 2

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
like, I don't know why

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
but there's still people that hella play that game too

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I just like, really want to play Diablo 2 for some reason

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
but I don't, I used to

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
have it a long, long time ago

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
but I can't find the CD

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
which sucks, because if I could

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
then I could enter in that code on Blizzard's website

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
or whatever now and just download it I think

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
ugh, oh well

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
anyhow, sorry Random

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Final Fantasy was a game we were talking about a little bit

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
earlier ago, and you know what's kind of

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
funny, I think we were talking about this a lot when we were talking about

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
video games live as well, is that the whole Squeenix

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
likes to protect their stuff

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
and they don't want their images shown

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
well, they don't want folks to

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
knock off their Final Fantasy products either

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
apparently they filed a

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
federal lawsuit

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
against

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Edgework Imports, Top Swords,

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Wholesale Gallery, Pacific Solutions Marketing

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.000
$600,000 judgment

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
and they are no longer allowed to make

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
fake Final Fantasy goods

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
whether it be inside their own stores or doing it on

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
eBay and Amazon

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
the defendants altogether issued a joint

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
statement saying that they regret

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
that they have sold these copies to consumers

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
and they would have never imported

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
the stuff in the first place if they knew that Squeenix

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
would respond so aggressively to stop them

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
they will never make this mistake again

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
sorry

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I bet you anything this Final Fantasy 13

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
poster we have in studio, you can probably barely see it

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
on Justin.tv, but right there where I'm pointing

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
it's behind the new penguins thing

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
that poster is a Final Fantasy 13

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
poster and I bet you anything

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
it's a bootleg

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
of course it's a bootleg

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
it's probably from one of these companies that just got the

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
$600,000 judgment

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
I like what darktatsuya says in chat

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
$600,000 judgment sounds like a game

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
might be like a new limit break in Final Fantasy 13

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
who knows

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
so if you are counterfeiting Final Fantasy

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
products and selling them for your own profit

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
you might want to stop

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
before you get the next Smackdown

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
so I don't know dark soccer are you forging any

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Final Fantasy goods?

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
no

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
alright well then you have nothing to worry about

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
but how about another story?

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
well I could do that

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Xbox Live Arcade Awards

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
oooh

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
so basically you can

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
vote and voting stops

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
on Tuesday March 10th

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
the voting starts on March 3rd

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
so you've got that window to cast

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
your vote for what you like best

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
so we've got

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
here's your I guess sort of virtual sample ballot

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
so go cast vote then

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
vote for Res HD a lot but at the same

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
time I don't think our listeners should be

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
voting in this poll because you know why

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
and I have a right to say this because I'm looking at

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
the OLR March Madness thing going on

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
and apparently Tetris is currently beating

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Super Metroid which is stupid

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
and I know this is happening mostly

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
in part to the whole debacle from last year

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
I knew this was going to happen people want their revenge

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
on me nah nah nah nah nah but you know what

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
if you're one of the people

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
that voted Tetris over Super Metroid

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
please do not vote in this poll because

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
you obviously don't know what you're talking about

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
dear people stop listening to

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Rob the end

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
I thought I'd

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
say something controversial alright

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
couple more news stories and we're going to get your calls

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
OLR

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
I got to vote for

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Tetris now you're such an asshole

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
nah I'm just kidding I'm not

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
I am not voting for Tetris because

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
you know what as much as I like

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Tetris Super Metroid

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
gets my vote

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
good job

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Super Metroid pulls ahead

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
alright good job

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
high five Loki

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
alright anyhow

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
couple more news stories and we're going to wrap up tonight

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Loki sorry

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
that's alright I understand

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
more Grand Theft Auto possibly

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
on the PSP apparently

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Sony is in talks with Rockstar

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
they want some more games for their PSP system

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
and you know what I'm down with that

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
let's get some San Andreas stories going on

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
um

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
apparently they're interested to see how

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars does

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
um you know cause

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
for a while there you know they have

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
the exclusive rights to the

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
handheld stuff now

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
you know the DS getting its own version of

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
the you know Grand Theft Auto series

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
uh oh

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
so uh be interesting to see

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
I know both of the PSP titles were

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
you know best sellers on

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
the console so

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
be very interesting to see how

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Chinatown Wars does

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
but be honest I mean the Chinatown Wars

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
stuff it's going to be good but it's

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
no PSP Grand Theft Auto games

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
those were you know just like the

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
PlayStation 2 ones and um

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
I hope they do another one

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
I really don't

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
but is Grand Theft Auto the type of thing you really want to play on your PSP

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Loki I mean you're a Grand Theft Auto fan

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
we played the PSP version for months

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
the multiplayer was fun

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
and yes

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
it is something I would play on my PSP

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
for long hours

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
and it's also fun to hack

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
apart

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
for long hours I'd like to see a Saints Row

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
on PSP but no that

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
wouldn't happen or even like Crackdown on PSP

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
that'd be awesome anything sandbox-ish

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
hell Atari

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
or Ubisoft or whoever owns Driver

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
make another Driver game

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
you don't have to put any effort into it

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
just make another Driver game make it crap like the last one

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
make it very cr- well their last game

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
I didn't really play but make it like Driver 3

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
just reissue Driver 3

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
make no changes

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
alright and uh finally

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
tonight um this is

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
something interesting apparently a

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
60 year old woman

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
got held hostage at gunpoint

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
for 10 hours in Brazil

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
um this week this is reported from

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
globo.com apparently

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
broke this story but here's the part

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
that makes it interesting and somewhat game

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
related um the gun

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
that was used a Sega

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
light phaser from the old Sega

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Master System of course

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Sega is still a huge presence in Brazil

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
the Master System is still marketed in Brazil

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
that's right so uh you know no surprise that

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
uh the Sega light phaser

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
uh was the light gun of choice however

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
uh do try to hold somebody

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
up with a light gun

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
and they didn't figure out

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
that this was a fake looking gun

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
60 year old woman

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
uh the man did uh release the

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
hostage good for him negotiated

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
with police and uh

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
it through after like two weeks I know it's been

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
kind of crazy the past couple weeks but that's okay

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
you know we have to take calls from different people you

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Ron yeah there sky I

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
want you to know something what

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
you almost killed me about

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
two hours ago how

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
your comment

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
about foodie monster I was eating

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
chips and drinking soda when you said

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
that the sad thing is I don't

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
even think he's listening tonight but um

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
he's not and no one's made a comment

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
to twitter about it to him either

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
hopefully somebody will bring it to his attention

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
that he ought to listen to tonight's show

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
cause I'm sure I'll get a nasty twitter email about

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
it if

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
no one else does it I will

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
alright you get to it hey

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
no cons this weekend

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
um I'm done with the cons for

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
the month I did comic con I did

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
catacon I did wicked winter

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
ren fair I'm on break until the end

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
of March oh nice

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
long break for you

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
something like that have you speaking of cons

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
have you been to video games live it's like a mini

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
con not yet when it

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
came around my way I just didn't have the money

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
and to be perfectly honest I wasn't

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
really that interested at the time you know

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
I would say they do a costume contest

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
and there were only like three people

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
that dressed up so like if you did

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
your black luigi thing or heck any of your

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
video game related costumes I think you'd have a good

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
shot to win like a DS or something like that

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
I'll check that out you should

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I bet you could do very well

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
yeah and speaking of like

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
conventions when you talked about the square enix

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
swords it would not be surprising

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
that I still see them at the conventions

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
or whatever's left the price would just

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
go double the triple for some odd

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
believe it or not they're cheaper than getting them

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
done commissioned by actual

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
prop makers probably

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
probably

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
is this true I see Breslull

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
in chat are saying you are going to sakura con

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
true or false no I'm not

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
oh

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
I kind of want to go to sakura con

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
I love seattle but I also want to go to packs

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
so I don't know and flights

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
aren't always necessarily

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
that cheap but I don't know I might be able

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
to come to sakura con

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
maybe if Breslull will let me

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
crash his place on the couch or something

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
as long as you don't violate

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
him in his sleep I promise

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I'll be good

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
and um last week you guys

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
he can't violate me in my sleep why are you telling

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
me he needs to not violate me

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
he would

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
be the one to do that

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
gs68 says come to faname

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
dammit I'm almost positive I'll

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
be at faname this year in fact we need to talk about

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
orange launch radio panel I think that is happening

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
I don't know so we'll

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
figure it out

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
wow

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
um I want you guys to know that

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
you guys covered an article

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
last week that you covered

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
like 3 years ago

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
you know sometimes those oddities

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
happen but what was the article just for fun

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
final fantasy 10 port

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
on the nes

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
really that had come up before I thought it was

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
recent I remember there was a 7

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
port on the ds a few years ago

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
that final fantasy 7 but I didn't remember

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
a 10 port so that's why

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
it was a 10 because someone

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
posted I followed the link and I'm like

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
this is 10 yeah

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
interesting well it happens

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
whatever you know we're not

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
perfect and the show's been going a long

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
time we can't remember

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
every story we've ever done it's gonna happen

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
that's fine I mean I was

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I had no problem with that that was pretty cool

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
yeah you know and of course you know we

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
don't have the same listeners now that we had 3

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
years ago either thankfully we have some of the faithfuls

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
like yourself and there's you know some others that

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
have been listening to the show for a long long time there's also

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
a lot of new faces too so you know

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
yeah definitely

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
so you know at some point

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Dark Sakura might

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
actually run out of classic games

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
to talk about so we're gonna have to figure something out

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
that's not likely gonna happen I doubt

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
I doubt that alright

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
be a long time alright

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
guinness book of world records

games of all time

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
and super mario kart apparently

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
has the longest legacy

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
and the biggest impact on video games

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
in all of history and that is according to again

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
the guinness book of world

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
records they need to get out of video games

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
number 2 tetris 3 grand theft

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
auto 4 super mario world

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
zelda green of time at number 5

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
all the way down to outrun 2 at number

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
50 it's like seriously guinness

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
no one gives a shit about your book anymore

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
hey i love guinness when it's booze

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
actually yes i give a shit about their book anymore

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
so sorry you're wrong

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
but even about video games?

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
yes actually

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
i think that it's fantastic that they're

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
still keeping track of all of this i think it's great

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
well i beg to differ

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
if they're still using twin galaxies to do it

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
but we'll save that another night

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
not using twin galaxies but i mean

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
but i still think that the

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
guinness book is fantastic

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
thanks for the call waiting on the line

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
hi this is spazzinator

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
hi spazzinator what's on your mind

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
um two things

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
um i just want to say thank you to

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
loki for showing off

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
nobody boy last week

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
uh thanks to him

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
showing off the folders

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
i ended up buying the game

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
uh during the middle of the week

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
it's actually quite fun

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
so uh thank you to him

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
we did some mixed reviews on that

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
so i'm glad to hear you liked it after all

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
no problem we tried to do that now that we've got the

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
justin tv thing hooked up pretty cool where

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
you know even though i think watching

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
a radio show being taped is the most boring thing

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
in the world at least the audio now

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
goes out over justin tv really well

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
and um you know we do those little breaks

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
in between that seem to work out really well

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
for the audience over there so and it

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
you know it opens up our show to a new group of people

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
cause there's a whole vast

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
you know user base on justin tv

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
that would never think to seek out all games

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
dot com or orange lounge radio otherwise

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
so hey it works

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
and um

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
as far as the

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
second thing um i just wanted

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
to respond to that one email

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
that you read earlier today

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
i can't remember his name

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
but he was asking about

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
you know advice

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
regarding final fantasy

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
11 yeah

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
yeah basically

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
you know i agree with a lot

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
of your criticisms of

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
final fantasy 11 i know

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
the game is not perfect

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
by a long shot but still

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
it is pretty fun

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
um i've been playing for

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
just barely over 3 years now

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
um i would recommend

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
that this person

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
get into a good

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
link shell which is

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
you know the game is equivalent to a guild

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
um and there's

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
uh you know the game

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
is designed to be very social

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
um so even if

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
you're just sitting around waiting

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
to get into a party

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
you know you can always you know shoot the

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
breeze with your friends in the link shell

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
uh while waiting

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
spazzinator i think it's um

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
that's true about like almost any mmo

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
is that like if you ask people

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
why do you play this game so much like i would say

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
this about wow it's the people

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
the people and the community is always going to be

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
what brings you you know to the game

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
so you're absolutely right no matter what

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
mmo you're going to play if you play wow you

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
need a guild if you play 11

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
you need a link shell you know or the equivalent

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
of these things in other games here i'm going to

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
try to ask you a question here what

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
would you say is

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
the number one thing

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
that draws you to final fantasy 11

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
besides the people what is it about

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
final fantasy 11 the game that

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
keeps you coming back

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
well you know

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
i've been a

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
pretty big fan of the series

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
as a whole

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
for a number of years and i figured

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
you know at the time

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
you know this was the next one

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
in the series now get that started

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
uh not only that

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
but since i'm primarily a console

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
gamer now my

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
selection of

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
mmo's are kind of limited

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
uh the

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
only other one that i'm familiar with

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
and heard of is

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
the playstation 2

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
version of everquest

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
and that was alright

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
but in final

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
fantasy 11 in my opinion

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
is a whole lot better

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
um and

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
plus you know you can play as

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
a black mage you know which

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
both of my characters are

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
and it's just so

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
much fun nuking the shit out

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
uh the beastmen in

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
final fantasy 11 you know whether

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
you're casting fire or

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
arrow or

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
thunder or whatever

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
you know just like

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
uh doing you know

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
casually uh casting

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
spells you know every

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
2 or 3 seconds you know

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
alright

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
well you know um i can see that because

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
final fantasy 11 was kind of a console

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
game you know it was made for the playstation 2

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
i know a lot of people here in america play it on

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
pc but most people over in japan play it on playstation 2

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
and a lot of people here in america play

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
it on playstation 2 as well it is one of the few

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
mmos very accessible through a

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
console so you know i can kind of see that wow

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
wow is missing um a significant user

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
base from not having a version of it

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
on consoles but then again i couldn't see wow

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
on a console so i get it well spazzinator

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000

spend his one month in final fantasy 11

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
and hopefully he'll stay a little longer after that

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000

okay you're you're i i don't know if

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
something's weird with the audio we're

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
getting it's a little hard to understand

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
may i want to get a little bit away from your mic

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
i don't know what's up with that no that's all right

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
um so you have some new games you want to review what's up what games

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
um gta

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
uh liberty city

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
and tony arx project 8

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
well tell us about them

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
well where we see stories

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
first time playing it even though

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
i'm only 16

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
i've been on amazon my debit card

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
um basically

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
what i like is if we play

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
it just for all humans but a lot more

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
i like rolling

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
around in the tank blowing stuff up

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
blowing

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
blowing stuff up in games is always fun

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
plus

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
the custom soundtrack option even though it comes

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
up in your safe house as corrupted

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
which is

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
weird but uh you can put

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
except it's very complicated to

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
put them into tsc and then put them

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
to that gta

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
for your songs

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
it's kind of cool though

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
so what was the other game you played besides grand theft auto

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
tony arx project 8

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
tell us a little more about

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
this game i don't this one's not ringing a bell

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
for some reason

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
basically it's like

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
all your tony arx games but a little bit more

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
of a challenge um

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
basically you had to keep

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
pushing up to keep your

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
skater going there is no auto kick option

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
whatsoever in the game

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
what game is this

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
what game is this

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
tony arx project 8

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
ok yeah now i understand

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
ok cause like when it was coming through

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
was it just me i couldn't understand what he was saying before

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
ok now i get it

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
so um

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
ok so is this a game

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
worthy of the tony arx series or is it

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
you know kind of average or what

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
um

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
it's a little bit more challenging i will say

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
it's going to be more of a challenge

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
for me

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
what makes

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
this game

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
different from the other tony

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
arx games

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
like

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
basically um

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
more area to explore

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
it's like a free realm

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
um game kind of like

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
american wasteland which the psp

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
never got

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
um because the ds

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
got american wasteland but

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
the ds never got project 8

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
and uh actually there is

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
another game i got

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
rock revolution for ds

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
that must be uh

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
that must be

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
interesting rock revolution on the ds

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
i know we had a review on that a couple weeks ago

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
i think sauce reviewed it i'm still tempted

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
to get it for 20 bucks on 360

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
i'm like oh that's 20 dollars i could like

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
buy lunch

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
actually the uh ds version

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
has the singing in it

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
which the consoles are missing

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
that is so weird but of course

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
the ds has the built in microphone

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
yeah

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
even though here's my little problem

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
here was when i've been on the psp

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
i mean why didn't her

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
mics just go with what um

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
activision did

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
and basically redo

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
the guitar grip but to fit the USB

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
port in a clamp on

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
because that one made sense

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
for a guitar grip

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
hmm

logi yeah there's a few things

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
real quick um there was

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
uh the announcement this week

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000

you know official that the

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
red xbox 360

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
elite system with resident evil

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
5 will be making its way

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
to stores at the same time as

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
the game by itself um

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
the system of course would be just like

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
your normal elite system except it's

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
going to be all red um

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
as well as there's going to be a red

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
uh controller to go along with it

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
you're going to get a

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
an exclusive resident evil 5 theme

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
and also a um

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
copy of super street fighter 2

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
turbo hd remix

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
as well as of course a resident evil 5

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
all that for the

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
low low price of $399.99

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
or just the normal price of an elite system

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
so um

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
pretty good deal if you were looking to buy an elite

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
system

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
and um the other thing

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
um that's supposed to be worked on right

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
now is apparently it is expected to

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
sign a deal for doom 4

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
um later this year

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
however they don't know who the publishers

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
going to be yet but you better believe

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
that you're going to see a doom 4

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
I wouldn't be surprised if it was EA

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
but you know

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
I don't know

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
doom 3 was kind of eh it was alright

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
and then

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
that's it

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
alright

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
well uh I guess that's going to do

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
it for tonight's show

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
let's go around and get everybody's last

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
final thoughts um my final

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
thought would be I should

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
I love it on the xbox live arcade

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
but I didn't play it enough on psp I think

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
