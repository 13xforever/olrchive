00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,901
[SPEAKER_03]: and I March 15, 2009.

2
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:22,608
[SPEAKER_03]: GamePro goes game publisher, Call of Duty passes a landmark for online play, and which company is

3
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

4
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:35,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_06]: And we tape live every Sunday night on allgames.com.

00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,673
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week.

10
00:00:58,414 --> 00:01:01,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining us also every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

11
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:02,436
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?

12
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:03,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.

13
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:04,998
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Techmaster Loki?

14
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:05,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing good.

15
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:06,719
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, excellent.

16
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:15,284
[SPEAKER_06]: And also joining us tonight, running fresh in from inside the house, live radio, say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:15,684
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

18
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:18,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I had beer last night and I feel good.

19
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:18,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Did ya?

20
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:19,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

21
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Much beer was had.

22
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:22,492
[SPEAKER_06]: But you always drink responsibly, correct?

23
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:25,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that's why I have someone else be responsible for me.

24
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:26,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, excellent.

25
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:33,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and of course, not only do we tape live on All Games Radio, but you can also watch our video feed on JustinTV.

26
00:01:33,158 --> 00:01:39,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Just before the show went live tonight, we were taking a peek at Mad World on the Nintendo Wii, which I guess has quickly become one of Loki's favorite games?

27
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:40,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

28
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:42,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is it about Mad World that you're loving?

29
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:43,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything.

30
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:44,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything.

31
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:45,452
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:06,868
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the Stephen King novel?

33
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:07,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Except they were running.

34
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:08,488
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the

35
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,271
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the long walk, Rob.

36
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,019
[SPEAKER_05]: MadWorld

37
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:18,256
[SPEAKER_06]: is really what the graphics look like.

38
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:20,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's more black and white than occasionally red.

39
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:21,999
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very red.

40
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,281
[SPEAKER_05]: As it is, you know, the game would be awesome just with that.

41
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:28,524
[SPEAKER_05]: But, oh no, Sega does not just stop there.

42
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:31,966
[SPEAKER_05]: They decide that we need sports commentators as well, and who did they get?

43
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Greg Proops and John DiMaggio.

44
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:38,390
[SPEAKER_05]: John DiMaggio, you might remember as the voice of Bender, and Greg Proops from whose line?

45
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:40,312
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have gotten Madden.

46
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,580
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?

47
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some Ragnarok.

48
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,671
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really about it.

49
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:17,852
[SPEAKER_02]: We've actually been having a different sort of gaming experience in my house, which is called cleaning out the vault.

50
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:23,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I found so much E3 swag and no one wants any of it.

51
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:24,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, trust me, it's shit.

52
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:31,195
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been piling up our systems and realized that we have four Saturns, two ColecoVisions.

53
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:32,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I want a Saturn.

54
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:34,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to my husband.

55
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:35,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two Saturns.

56
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:37,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I would.

57
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,951
[SPEAKER_06]: What would I play on the Saturn, seriously?

58
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:45,516
[SPEAKER_02]: We're debating taking one of our systems and doing a giveaway with it and having us autograph it or something.

59
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants a ColecoVision?

60
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:47,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

61
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck getting that shit to work.

62
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,441
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it works just fine.

63
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:53,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it really?

64
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:57,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you even hook those up to newer TVs?

65
00:04:58,104 --> 00:04:58,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

66
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:00,425
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the RCA.

67
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:02,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not RCA, the RF.

68
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they have an RF.

69
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:07,848
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have two driving wheels.

70
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:09,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd have a spare driving wheel.

71
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,050
[SPEAKER_02]: One of ours is Canadian.

72
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:16,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We have my Super Nintendo, which was the very first system I bought with my own money.

73
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:18,874
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

74
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:21,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And the person who owned it before me smoked because it's all yellow.

75
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we've got piles of stuff just hanging around.

76
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, hey!

77
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:33,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, maybe a giveaway.

78
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:33,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

79
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:40,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, but we did also... We have a stack of old strategy guides.

80
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:42,349
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of them from the 80s.

81
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:45,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, some of that stuff goes for money on eBay.

82
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:47,729
[SPEAKER_02]: We have How to Win at Castlevania.

83
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,690
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

84
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:50,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

85
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,172
[SPEAKER_01]: You win at Castlevania!

86
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:53,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, Dracula!

87
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo, I get a car!

88
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:58,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to also introduce the chat room right now at this time.

89
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:01,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeEntreter.com, always when we're taping live on Sunday nights.

90
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:05,871
[SPEAKER_06]: The listener experience and getting to interact with the show is really what makes this show unique.

91
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of reading some comments here from the chat room.

92
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:12,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw says, Greg Proops is awesome.

93
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:17,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Wolf points out, John DiMaggio is also the voice of Marcus Phoenix.

94
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:22,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And he should have done it, I'm sorry, Quiltipo says, John DiMaggio should have done it in his Waka voice.

95
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:24,612
[SPEAKER_06]: PagelDS

96
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:52,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Why have I... You know, it's sad that I found Peggle now, because it is quite addicting.

97
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:55,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, wait, I don't know why you're knocking it.

98
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:56,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't this a good thing?

99
00:06:56,926 --> 00:06:57,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not knocking it.

100
00:06:57,787 --> 00:07:00,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, oh, Peg, there's something else to be addicted to.

101
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, I gotcha.

102
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:03,292
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's actually kind of fun.

103
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,034
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's pretty cool.

104
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:05,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

105
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:08,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you checked out the one on Xbox yet?

106
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:08,823
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

107
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:12,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, because I was going to ask you, how is it different on the DS?

108
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:13,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played any other version of Peggle?

109
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:13,868
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

110
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then never mind.

111
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:15,929
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't answer my question.

112
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to ask, how is it different on the DS, but I guess you can't answer that.

113
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really that different, I don't think, from anything else.

114
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:30,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you control it with the stylus to aim, and then when you hold the stylus in one spot, it'll zoom in, and then you can fine aim with that.

115
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:30,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

116
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you just tap a button, and it'll...

117
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:33,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Shoot.

118
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:34,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

119
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:39,287
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt asks the wife test question, asking, would Nelly play Peggle?

120
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:39,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

121
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't shown it to her yet.

122
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,831
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got cookies!

123
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:53,535
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that are randomly yelling out, my roommate just popped in the studio here and has a really big smirk on his face.

124
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:55,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to figure out... Oh, boy.

125
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:57,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, John wants to speak on the show.

126
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we give you a nickname on this show?

127
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:00,939
[SPEAKER_06]: John?

128
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,820
[SPEAKER_06]: My roommate?

129
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:01,920
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

130
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, your secret nickname is Roommator John.

131
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:08,451
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to get you a mic here.

132
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:10,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Your superhero name would be the roomie.

133
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:11,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make this short.

134
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:17,995
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually play tons and tons of video games, but iPhone game app called Arvale.

135
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely amazing, old school, Final Fantasy style game.

136
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:25,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't been able to stop playing it for like three days, and it's fantastic.

137
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually paid for the paid version, which is unspeakable and unheard of.

138
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,000
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my little plug.

139
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,029
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you find this game?

140
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:35,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little more about how it plays.

141
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is unheard of that you actually want to participate in the show and about video games and not making fun of me.

142
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:45,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So I definitely want to know a little bit more about how you found this and how it plays and all that.

143
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:46,836
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you control it on an iPhone?

144
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:49,139
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple.

145
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:57,065
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little action button for most things, and there's a little control pad, so it's left, right, up, down, diagonals.

146
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:07,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Found it going through strategy games that were free on the iPhone, and liked it so much I bought the paid version.

147
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:14,658
[SPEAKER_00]: It plays like an old school Final Fantasy, like maybe Final Fantasy V or so, I think, and...

148
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, am I filling in for Jamie?

149
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I supposed to like grow tits tonight or be extra sassy?

150
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:25,563
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just going to the loo, I think.

151
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:30,705
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to the soda, which is kind of like the loo.

152
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:32,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should keep the soda in the bathroom.

153
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:37,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what else was I going to ask though?

154
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:39,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this game available anywhere else that you know of?

155
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:42,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Because some folks in our chat room are saying, I don't have an iPhone, so are they just screwed?

156
00:09:43,677 --> 00:09:47,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would say that their life is incomplete and they need to go buy an iPhone.

157
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,958
[SPEAKER_00]: These are obvious things.

158
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:51,879
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I'm having to tell your listeners this.

159
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Apple thanks you for the free plug.

160
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,660
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

161
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:55,821
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

162
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:58,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you, John, for your contributions.

163
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you forgot to wave to Justin TV.

164
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:00,565
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very mad.

165
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:04,368
[SPEAKER_06]: They had to look at your butt the whole time you were talking, and now they want some recognition.

166
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:04,728
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

167
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:08,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, Loki, I'm so sorry about that.

168
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:11,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's okay, that's okay.

169
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:17,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than PagleDS, I also played Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, which is interesting.

170
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:22,074
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a different take on Grand Theft... Well, not that different.

171
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's very similar to 1 and 2.

172
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:31,902
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, having come off of 4 and Lost and Damned, it is kind of hard to go back to the 2D stuff.

173
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:32,763
[SPEAKER_05]: But, or...

174
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:33,603
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

175
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:04,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And then other than DS stuff, I've also played, of course, more Lost and Damned.

176
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Still lots of multiplayer in that.

177
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:13,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing around with the glitch of the game, there's a spot where pedestrians spawn in the middle of the air and fall from the sky.

178
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:14,767
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of fun.

179
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:20,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I played a little bit of PS3 today.

180
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:25,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I went ahead and finally got around to playing the little big Planet Contra levels.

181
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:26,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of fun.

182
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:39,063
[SPEAKER_05]: and, um, I also went and played Noby Noby Boy for a few sec- I would say, yeah, a few seconds until Nelly's, like, that, like, bass sound when you're stretching is really fucking annoying.

183
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:40,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So turn it off.

184
00:11:41,605 --> 00:11:43,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So I stopped playing that.

185
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:44,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, which-

186
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:46,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

187
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:47,250
[SPEAKER_05]: She cracked the whip.

188
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, of course, Mad World.

189
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,056
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is awesome in all sorts of ways.

190
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:59,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I haven't really made it past the first level because I haven't gotten a chance to actually sit down and play it for a long enough time.

191
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:03,086
[SPEAKER_05]: The first level is really cool, though, so I can't wait.

192
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:06,102
[SPEAKER_06]: SuperMetroid 0

193
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:29,567
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

194
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:48,727
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

195
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:13,452
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you just have to imagine, for those, you know, I know not everybody lives where we live and knows this place, but it's a giant castle with a big golf course and a big water park that they're known for.

196
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:18,035
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just like they let little kids just run the frickin' place because of it.

197
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, they don't know how to treat machines.

198
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:24,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Parents don't know how to police their children in a place like that, so the machines... And they change their diapers on the machines.

199
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:24,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

200
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

201
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think she's lying, that's a completely true story.

202
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:30,324
[SPEAKER_06]: A diaper was once changed on a keyboard mania machine.

203
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:33,646
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, the machines run down, broken, blah.

204
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,916
[SPEAKER_06]: But we heard they got a Beatmania 2DX machine so we had to go check it out.

205
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:37,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

206
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:45,976
[SPEAKER_06]: We went, and I hadn't been in like a year, 18 months or so, and color me shocked, but the place looked really nice.

207
00:13:46,336 --> 00:14:03,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they remodeled or something, they did some repainting in there, I didn't find a machine that was broken, everything looked to be in a good state, I mean, granted, I saw Supernova 2, the monitor was a little junky, but honestly, considering all the parts worked, the Max 2 pads worked great, 2DX was in awesome condition, um...

208
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,003
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

209
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:29,464
[SPEAKER_06]: because the place was in a good state.

210
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:37,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So I played Beatmania 2DX Distorted, which I'd played before because I had it at E3 a few years ago, but I haven't really touched Beatmania 2DX in a long time.

211
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:46,059
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long, long time, probably since this show took a more general gaming approach as opposed to just music video games that we used to do.

212
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,821
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've missed it.

213
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:48,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

214
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:51,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, I found myself playing all old songs, but...

215
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:54,366
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

216
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:20,802
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, the machine was nice and loud because you could turn the effectors on and all that.

217
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:23,083
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell them about, was it Guitar Hero Arcade?

218
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:25,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they had Guitar Hero Arcade, which I played.

219
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I only played it once, so I can't really give a full review on it.

220
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:32,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just tell you I got pissed off because Roseville Golf Line also switched to cards.

221
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,073
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't use tokens anymore, but cards.

222
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:40,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I was swiping the card through and everything, I somehow hit the button an extra time to start the game, and I accidentally got on easy mode.

223
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't switch it once you're on easy mode.

224
00:15:43,781 --> 00:16:00,697
[SPEAKER_06]: But to me, honestly, it just looked like the freaking home game, except a smaller song list, and it was just basically Guitar Hero 3 with a slightly smaller song list, and prettier because there's lights on the machine, and it spins around, and the TV they use is very, very crisp.

225
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,679
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a very sharp image, but I don't know.

226
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you want to pay a dollar a game for something you can get at home?

227
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:07,203
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.

228
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:10,266
[SPEAKER_06]: But I understand there is an audience for this thing.

229
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:12,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of cool to go out and play with your friends and all that stuff.

230
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can see where this machine might do decent.

231
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:19,056
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you have Guitar Hero at home, I don't see the point in this game.

232
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:20,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly.

233
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:21,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

234
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:27,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what else did I do in my gaming week this week?

235
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:33,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the demo of The Last Remnant on the PC, and I was a little disappointed at how choppy it was.

236
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:40,130
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just bought this PC back in August, so I know it's not like old parts or anything, but I was a little disappointed at how choppy it was.

237
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,811
[SPEAKER_06]: But the game itself seemed kind of fun, so I might try to check it out on Xbox 360, although the PC one was supposed to have all the extra stuff.

238
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Peggle on Xbox Live Arcade.

239
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:53,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded and played for a while, and good times.

240
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:54,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I was already addicted to the one online.

241
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:57,405
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sparkles and rainbows and Plinko.

242
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:58,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

243
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:02,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to play some more of the multiplayer, though, before I can give my full impressions on that.

244
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:06,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fun playing Pagel and I think a lot of people are going to check this out.

245
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:16,920
[SPEAKER_06]: What I like about Pagel versus PopCap's other efforts on Xbox Live such as Bejeweled 2 and Zuma is that this doesn't just feel like a port of their PC game, the full one.

246
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like they've really tinkered some stuff to work with Xbox Live, hence the multiplayer, and they've really kind of made it special for Xbox Live.

247
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:26,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what's kind of cool about Pagel.

248
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,286
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it really stand out.

249
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:28,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3

250
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:46,402
[SPEAKER_06]: was on sale, so I figured, what the heck?

251
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:52,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked it up, I bought it, because I got a new dance mat for Xbox, whatever, and got to play Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3.

252
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:57,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to know what the most hilarious thing about Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 is?

253
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:04,892
[SPEAKER_06]: On the back of the box, they advertise these songs that are in the game, one of them being Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.

254
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,693
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, okay, I want to check that song out.

255
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:09,194
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not in the game.

256
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:15,678
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, of all the songs that are mentioned on the back of the box, apparently only one of them is actually in the game.

257
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:16,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, it's not.

258
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:20,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I looked on web forums, DDR Freak, which is still kicking after all these years.

259
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:20,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knew?

260
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:25,467
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Freak apparently confirms these songs are not in the game.

261
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're advertised on the back of the box.

262
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's false advertising.

263
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

264
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I say we sue Konami.

265
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:31,532
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with that?

266
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:32,814
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll turn it around on him.

267
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:40,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I understand mistakes happen and all, but this is a pretty fucking big mistake.

268
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,391
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

269
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:42,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

270
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:45,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised they're not trying to send out stickers.

271
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:48,096
[SPEAKER_06]: How does something like that happen?

272
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Who fucked up that bad?

273
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:51,698
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been out for a while.

274
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:53,339
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably just figured no one has noticed.

275
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,100
[SPEAKER_06]: My God.

276
00:18:56,281 --> 00:19:03,564
[SPEAKER_06]: But look, the game itself, putting the box aside and all that trite crap, the game itself is okay.

277
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:05,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not my favorite home version of a DDR game.

278
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:08,126
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think I even preferred the song list in Universe 1.

279
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,207
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely no Ultramix 2.

280
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:12,328
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not bad.

281
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:19,271
[SPEAKER_06]: The interface is pretty slick, very crisp, very vibrant graphics, funny background animations.

282
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:22,953
[SPEAKER_06]: 2DX Fan Service 2DX Fan Service 2DX Fan Service 2DX Fan Service 2DX Fan Service

283
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I thought it was strange.

284
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:55,099
[SPEAKER_06]: The download content, the interface, you can't preview the songs.

285
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd never heard of any of them, so I don't know what I want to download.

286
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:59,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they even have download content?

287
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:00,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they do.

288
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:10,991
[SPEAKER_06]: My Universe 1 songs, though, did not come into Universe 3, but apparently there's a Universe pack available, so I'm not sure if it's trying to make me re-buy the songs I already bought with Universe 1, and if that's the case, that's kind of crappy.

289
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

290
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:30,578
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how the dialogue has gone.

291
00:20:30,658 --> 00:20:33,319
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like the whole yo dog type stuff.

292
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:36,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, the, oh, everybody, you know, it's just bad.

293
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:38,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Dialogue by Randy Jackson.

294
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:39,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's bad.

295
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:43,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Leo Shen asks, was the quest mode like you got served, Sky?

296
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:44,524
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's weird.

297
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:53,989
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this big circular thing and you go to these different places and in the first circle you gain coins to challenge people in the second circle and if you beat them you get the song.

298
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:56,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't incredibly difficult, but

299
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:02,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I unlocked the entire second circle in one night, but now it won't let me go to the third circle because I haven't played enough in the first circle.

300
00:21:02,757 --> 00:21:04,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to play the easy stuff, but whatever.

301
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And eventually you'll get to the seventh ring of hell.

302
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:11,970
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, here's the thing.

303
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to necessarily give this game a negative review because I don't think it's necessarily bad.

304
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:19,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do encourage people to play DDR because I think it's a way to stay fit and exercise.

305
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:22,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, again, I think everything's pretty sharp.

306
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:25,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't necessarily like some of the creative direction they took in it.

307
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:27,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think the new quest mode is anything that exciting.

308
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think the new interface is that great.

309
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:35,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I think having the giant CD cover box art thing in the wheels is a bit much.

310
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't go for

311
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:42,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, if you make me the production director of this series, I could bring it around like nothing.

312
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not necessarily bad, it's just another DDR game.

313
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:52,034
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, these things are a dime a dozen.

314
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:58,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to see the DDR teams at Konami really try to reinvent this stuff.

315
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:04,200
[SPEAKER_06]: For love of God, whoever made that big mistake about putting songs on there that weren't actually in the game, that was a

316
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:09,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that just kind of speaks as to how lazy they're getting.

317
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:18,859
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm like, it's not necessarily a big deal, okay, so somebody made a mistake, whatever, but it just speaks volume as to how lazy it feels like they're getting with DDR.

318
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:22,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And which is sad because I know there's a lot of people that work very hard on this series.

319
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:25,985
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've had friends who worked for the series that worked very hard on it.

320
00:22:26,065 --> 00:22:28,927
[SPEAKER_06]: It's some of these creative things coming up from the top level.

321
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised they didn't make a big deal about that, I mean, everywhere.

322
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:33,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Because usually, I mean, hell, they made a big deal out of

323
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:36,953
[SPEAKER_05]: The IGN watermark being on the Okami cover.

324
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:41,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was something really stupid and small and had no impact really on the game.

325
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:43,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

326
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:50,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was Super Stardust Portable that was missing modes and stuff that were advertised on there.

327
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:55,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is kind of a big deal that there's songs missing from the game that are advertised on there.

328
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:58,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that right there, say if you bought it for that song...

329
00:22:59,315 --> 00:22:59,515
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

330
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:16,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

331
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,392
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

332
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,371
[SPEAKER_05]: because they just don't care anymore.

333
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:16,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like shifting your focus to actually increase your market share with groups of people that don't normally play your games and ignoring your core players and thinking they're just going to stick around is not the way to be thinking.

334
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my challenge.

335
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:28,185
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my last thing I want to say because I know there are people at Konami that listen to this program, and I'm not just talking about people that are like my personal friends and what have you, but I know there's people higher up.

336
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:33,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, less than three is one of the songs in freaking DDR Universe 3.

337
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,573
[SPEAKER_06]: The same song that was a theme song to Rice Princess' show she had on the old station, okay?

338
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:43,198
[SPEAKER_06]: If that doesn't prove somebody at Konami is looking out for us, I don't know what does, okay?

339
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:44,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing I want to say to y'all.

340
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Look.

341
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:46,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I love DDR.

342
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:49,082
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR has introduced me to a lot of great people.

343
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:49,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not know Loki.

344
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:52,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not know DarkSakura if it were not for DDR.

345
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:56,865
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that being said, do not throw away a good thing.

346
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:59,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not be afraid to reinvent yourselves.

347
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:07,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And I challenge you, step away from making, resist the temptation of doing a Universe 4 or X2 or Disney 3.

348
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you to nuke your code and start from the ground up.

349
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:15,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Build a new DDR game from the ground up.

350
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,674
[SPEAKER_06]: No recycled code.

351
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a brand new DDR game and really try to push the limits of what you're doing with it.

352
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:26,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you would really stand to win back a lot of people that are starting to think you're getting a little lazy.

353
00:25:26,578 --> 00:25:29,759
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it before and what did it do for the community for a while?

354
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:34,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it really rejuvenated everything when we got the Max series.

355
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:35,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when it was new?

356
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:44,547
[SPEAKER_06]: and honestly, DDR Ultramix, especially 2, not so much Ultramix 1, but Ultramix 2 when they really were getting in their groove, no pun intended, sold me on an Xbox.

357
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:45,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It really did.

358
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:48,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was all new code because they had to make it for the Xbox.

359
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also the other thing too, I think, is the way that they're treating their series.

360
00:25:52,732 --> 00:25:56,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at Pump It Up and the new versions of that game.

361
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:58,276
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of excitement behind it.

362
00:25:58,316 --> 00:25:59,716
[SPEAKER_05]: They bring it out and it's like, BAM!

363
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:00,397
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a new game.

364
00:26:00,437 --> 00:26:00,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

365
00:26:00,997 --> 00:26:01,958
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got all these things in it.

366
00:26:02,258 --> 00:26:03,479
[SPEAKER_05]: And people get excited about it, but

367
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:11,603
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR, it's like, ah, new DDR, hooray, this time it's got more Disney characters, hurrah.

368
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:16,526
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that no one cares anymore, and they need to really change it up.

369
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:28,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm serious, I have a way to fix this, but no one wants to listen, and I don't feel like explaining it because, well, it's just, it's all in my head, and unfortunately I can't put it on paper very, you know, but I can explain it the...

370
00:26:29,164 --> 00:26:40,020
[SPEAKER_05]: basically the whole quest mode thing taking a totally different approach to that basically you have stuff that goes along because the problem with quest mode is they don't know how to make it where

371
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:41,838
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually matters.

372
00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:46,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can't obviously do it as like a dance-off competition thing because that doesn't make any sense.

373
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you can't do that in DDR because it's a technical game.

374
00:26:49,863 --> 00:26:52,504
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not based on, you know, doing moves and that kind of crap.

375
00:26:53,025 --> 00:27:01,829
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you make it something different, like say, for example, how well you're doing a song affects the performance of, say, something else that's going on.

376
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:08,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally separate things, you know, just basically instead of, you know, your actions on a gamepad or something like that,

377
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:08,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

378
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:25,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

379
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:47,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Try it for the exercise alone.

380
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:49,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

381
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:50,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Comments from chat.

382
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Floatwalk says, Two words.

383
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,301
[SPEAKER_06]: National tournament.

384
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:54,981
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely what Pump It Up does.

385
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:57,682
[SPEAKER_06]: The tournaments they do in Korea are huge.

386
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:02,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And Floatwalk says, For crying out loud, the tournament scene made DDR's popularity in the States.

387
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:04,025
[SPEAKER_06]: True facts.

388
00:28:05,145 --> 00:28:08,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Acidic Vampire says, What DDR needs is violence like Mad World.

389
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:10,808
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR does not need violence.

390
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:13,269
[SPEAKER_05]: At least not that level of violence.

391
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:13,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

392
00:28:14,788 --> 00:28:17,330
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it doesn't need that.

393
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,792
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do agree that you could take the quest mode and literally make it like an RPG type thing.

394
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:26,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

395
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:29,476
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

396
00:28:29,556 --> 00:28:33,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you a reason why RPG stuff will never work with Dance Dance Revolution.

397
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:37,300
[SPEAKER_02]: It all goes back to a little known game called Dance Dance Dance.

398
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:38,821
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

399
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:41,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I remember that game.

400
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:43,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I've played it and yes, it sucks.

401
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:45,263
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

402
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:47,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on.

403
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:52,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to spend too much time reminiscing the old days, although that's kind of what I did this week by going to Golfland.

404
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

405
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:54,868
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

406
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:58,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Since that does it for our gaming week, let's get to some housekeeping.

407
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:58,350
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

408
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So look, we've sat here and kind of been critical of DDR for the last few minutes.

409
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:04,033
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will say this.

410
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:07,515
[SPEAKER_06]: At our heart, we do love Konami and so on.

411
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:12,258
[SPEAKER_06]: On our website, www.orangeentrader.com, there actually have been polling –

412
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:29,164
[SPEAKER_06]: all of our listeners all week long about your top three favorite Konami games since their 40th birthday is coming up and we're giving them a present now with this week long feature of the best games as selected by you guys the listeners from Konami's archives 1500 Konami games over the years if you can believe it

413
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:34,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of voting, March Madness is almost over.

414
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,767
[SPEAKER_06]: It's down to the final four.

415
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now you have Rock Band versus Super Mario Bros.

416
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:38,648
3.

417
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:43,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have Chrono Trigger versus Zelda Link to the Past.

418
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,311
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe voting time is going to be up very, very soon.

419
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:50,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're listening live here on this Sunday evening, you're going to want to go try to get in your last minute votes.

420
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:53,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And the final two will probably be decided tonight.

421
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,918
[SPEAKER_06]: March 22nd, next week.

422
00:29:57,658 --> 00:30:00,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to be here, so I'm not sure if there's going to be a show or not.

423
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:04,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned to our website, www.orangeandrade.com for more details.

424
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:08,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they might try to find a way to tape elsewhere, but I will not be here next week.

425
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:11,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be on a trip, but I will be back in two weeks, so we'll keep you posted.

426
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:14,855
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's really it for housekeeping.

427
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:16,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stay tuned to our website.

428
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:17,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I want to say something about the website real fast.

429
00:30:17,937 --> 00:30:18,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I...

430
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:21,238
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

431
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:50,026
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, they've been writing articles about indie game spotlights, games you ought to be playing but you probably aren't, and highlighting music from video games.

432
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:53,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been actually really cool to kind of go to the site and see this stuff.

433
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:57,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I love about it is that, in a way, it's because we're not doing it.

434
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:03,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, kind of what the show is all about, letting the listeners have control and the community and what the community wants to hear about.

435
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:07,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So props to you guys who've all been working hard on the website.

436
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:08,822
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been pretty awesome.

437
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:16,706
[SPEAKER_06]: and I have an idea for a feature too that I'm hoping to contribute very soon and I'll be back on posting regular updates very soon.

438
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:19,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I think that's it for housekeeping.

439
00:31:19,687 --> 00:31:21,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into some gaming news.

440
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,568
[SPEAKER_06]: We're only like 30 minutes into the show.

441
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:23,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to it.

442
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, start us off with some gaming news.

443
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:35,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so anyways, there has been some concern by MTV's Totillo that

444
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:43,024
[SPEAKER_05]: There might not be enough exclusives during 2009 for the Xbox 360.

445
00:31:43,464 --> 00:31:55,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, unfortunately what Steven doesn't realize is that there are, but he just doesn't understand that there are a lot of things coming out that people think that aren't exclusive, are exclusive, and that they think that are exclusive that aren't exclusive.

446
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:56,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of confusing.

447
00:31:57,572 --> 00:32:02,715
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, he says the loss of Xbox exclusive franchises like Mass Effect...

448
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

449
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:24,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Project Gotham Racing Project Gotham Racing

450
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:58,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, there's also Halo 3 ODST, or whatever they're calling it now.

451
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, that's just for right now.

452
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, they haven't really been talking much about their 2009 lineup, which they're probably saving for E3.

453
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:12,382
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going to be like, bam, bam, bam, bam, here's all this shit that's coming out.

454
00:33:13,422 --> 00:33:17,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think they are going to, at E3, just blow us away?

455
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:18,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

456
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:19,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

457
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:28,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I can kind of see where this guy has some concerns for Xbox 360 because they don't have a big Halo 3 this year or anything of that caliber.

458
00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:30,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, you had Halo Wars, but it's not the same thing.

459
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:34,129
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no big, big must-have title.

460
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:35,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like we got a lot of that last year.

461
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're not going to let us down with just...

462
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:40,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

463
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:01,334
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:23,541
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

465
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:47,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock 2 is going to be a huge Christmas title, but it's not specific to any system.

466
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:11,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, I think it actually is going to be coming out in August, just like it did the first time.

467
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:17,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's tons of stuff coming out that we don't know about yet that are going to be big titles.

468
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:24,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that each side, both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, are both going to have exclusive titles that are going to be really awesome.

469
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:33,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't really think it matters about the exclusive titles because there's just more titles coming out on the Xbox 360 right now.

470
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:34,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

471
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:37,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Developers Conference

472
00:35:54,927 --> 00:35:55,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

473
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:57,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, I mean, there's going to be announcements probably there as well.

474
00:35:58,149 --> 00:35:59,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's lots of stuff.

475
00:35:59,629 --> 00:36:02,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only that, but they're not only focusing on just console stuff.

476
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:06,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you've got XNA, which is really hitting its strides now.

477
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:07,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Live Arcade.

478
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:09,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows what they're going to go with.

479
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:13,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think a Game Developers Conference, though, you're going to get huge game announcements.

480
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:16,218
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think you'll get, like, infrastructure type things.

481
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:19,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember, Game Developers Conference was where, like, Home was announced.

482
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:19,820
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a...

483
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:32,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that was announced at Game Developers Conference, but I could see that being the type of thing.

484
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:34,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that affect the developers.

485
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that affect the backbones of these systems are the types of announcements I would expect to see.

486
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:39,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Upgrades and things of that note.

487
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:44,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this would be a great time for Nintendo to finally put out that SD card thing they've been talking about.

488
00:36:44,773 --> 00:36:45,353
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be great.

489
00:36:45,593 --> 00:36:47,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a 2GB card right here.

490
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:50,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here, just waiting to go in the Wii.

491
00:36:51,515 --> 00:36:52,576
[SPEAKER_06]: To store all my crap.

492
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:56,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm hoping that thing will come out soon.

493
00:36:58,017 --> 00:36:59,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, there will be...

494
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:01,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, wait, I gotta read.

495
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:02,485
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be some comments from chat right now.

496
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:03,525
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one I gotta read right now.

497
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:07,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Acidic Vampire is betting at E3 this year.

498
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:11,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft will reveal that Final Fantasy XIII Versus will be on the Xbox 360.

499
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:14,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt that.

500
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:15,289
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

501
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:21,331
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru says Microsoft at E3 will announce that the best non-Sony games that are appearing on PlayStation 3 will also be on the Xbox 360.

502
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:28,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Amaze Satsuma corrects me and says Microsoft did Gears 2 was announced at Game Developers Conference.

503
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:31,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is not unheard of for games to be announced at Game Developers Conference.

504
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:33,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because they're talking about the enhancements to Unreal 3.

505
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:35,784
[SPEAKER_05]: That stuff.

506
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:39,026
[SPEAKER_05]: You might hear something about Unreal 4 maybe.

507
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:39,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

508
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:40,407
[SPEAKER_05]: That may be interesting.

509
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:40,828
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be.

510
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:48,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some stuff from about Doom 4 because I think they're going to be talking about that and probably Rage a little bit.

511
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:51,255
[SPEAKER_05]: What was I going to say though?

512
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the whole rumor thing about Final Fantasy Versus.

513
00:37:57,061 --> 00:38:00,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Square's kind of already done that with Xbox 360.

514
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:05,503
[SPEAKER_05]: If you notice, the last few games that they've put out have been only on Xbox 360 and have been exclusive.

515
00:38:05,623 --> 00:38:09,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Ocean, Last Hope, The Last Remnant.

516
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:13,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that... Oh gosh, I'm forgetting now.

517
00:38:14,145 --> 00:38:17,806
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, a lot of their RPGs are going to be strictly...

518
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,879
[SPEAKER_05]: on the Xbox 360, but now they're going to start getting some PS3 ones.

519
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Infinite Undiscovered?

520
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:24,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Infinite Undiscovered, that's what I was thinking.

521
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:26,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff I did not buy.

522
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:29,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

523
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:34,456
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a lot of companies that are going to be developing for them because it's easier to develop on that platform.

524
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:44,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless Sony figures out a way to educate these guys a lot faster and figure out how to develop for a lot easier, that's going to be the problems they're going to face.

525
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:49,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, being this far into the console cycle, it's probably not going to change.

526
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:52,980
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just have to wait for the next round and we'll see how it goes there.

527
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:54,056
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

528
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:21,504
[SPEAKER_06]: But they still have yet to really just break through and be massive over there.

529
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:24,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this will help because the Japanese love their shmups.

530
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:25,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Shoot them up.

531
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:26,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Shmup.

532
00:39:27,187 --> 00:39:30,288
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is called Mamoru-kun Has Been Cursed.

533
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,929
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the English translation of this title.

534
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:34,150
[SPEAKER_06]: It is coming out on the Xbox 360.

535
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:39,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to come with a soundtrack CD and a Super Play DVD.

536
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:41,313
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a limited edition that's coming on the Xbox 360.

537
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:43,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out for 8,500 yen.

538
00:39:43,193 --> 00:39:45,134
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want the regular edition, it's 5,980 yen.

539
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:48,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let me tell you a little bit about this game here.

540
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:55,638
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been developed by G-Rev, and apparently it has character designs in it by Mizuki Takayama.

541
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:59,620
[SPEAKER_06]: He did some other famous shoot-'em-up games.

542
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,421
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually a translation of an arcade game.

543
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,322
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like you play a little dude.

544
00:40:04,342 --> 00:40:08,604
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not actually a ship, but it looks like you're actually a little person that's walking around, kind of doing the fighting.

545
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:10,204
[SPEAKER_06]: So, kind of interesting.

546
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:14,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about an elementary school student who finds themselves in a nightmarish underworld.

547
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:15,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So it definitely looks...

548
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of cool.

549
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:28,591
[SPEAKER_06]: The interesting thing, though, about these shoot-'em-ups, they don't translate well for widescreen systems because, you know, shoot-'em-ups are usually very vertical-oriented and you can't really turn your TV on its side, so you only end up using a very small portion of the screen.

550
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:30,572
[SPEAKER_06]: You can if you have a really kick-ass mounting setup.

551
00:40:30,632 --> 00:40:33,293
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, but people don't usually have that.

552
00:40:33,553 --> 00:40:38,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my husband's new monitor, the widescreen HDMI, has access to Pivoton.

553
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:44,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually a lot more that you're finding these days are built to shift position.

554
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:51,181
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think some of the games, even the Xbox Live Arcade games like Ikaruga, I think did support that as well.

555
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few Saturn games that actually will let you do that.

556
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:55,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the Thunder Blade games will do it.

557
00:40:57,284 --> 00:41:05,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just to give you an idea of some of the other things that G-Rev has developed, because it's coming out here, they did do some work with Ikaruga and Gradius V, just so you know.

558
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:16,995
[SPEAKER_06]: They did some programming and background graphic design for Ikaruga, and same thing for Gradius V. So, you know, they have touched those games, and they've also done some work with Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker, which is an old school Dreamcast game.

559
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:18,716
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

560
00:41:19,717 --> 00:41:21,318
[SPEAKER_06]: This game, a shmup coming out in Japan.

561
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,680
[SPEAKER_06]: No word if it's coming out over here, although I gotta be honest, probably not.

562
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,553
[SPEAKER_02]: How about we shift gears a little bit?

563
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:28,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah ha ha!

564
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:30,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's Gears of War 2 patches!

565
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that fun, Rob?

566
00:41:33,643 --> 00:41:33,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool!

567
00:41:34,813 --> 00:41:38,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's going to be a premium map pack called Snowblind.

568
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:45,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out on March 31st, and it'll have three new maps and a remake of Fuel Depot from the first Gears of War.

569
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:55,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's supposed to bring in experience-based ranking and rebalance the gameplay a bit more, try to give everyone a better sense of progression.

570
00:41:57,627 --> 00:42:02,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll still be using the true skill system, but it's sort of background now.

571
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:08,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just something to make people feel more rewarded for how well they do.

572
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:14,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can earn your experience in matches that will get you through 100 levels.

573
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:20,095
[SPEAKER_02]: You get milestones for each level, I think, each certain level that you get.

574
00:42:20,115 --> 00:42:24,356
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get an achievement for it, as well as, of course, the packs.

575
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,616
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a possibility of getting another 250 gamer score points.

576
00:42:29,057 --> 00:42:43,043
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an auto-balancing feature that will put a bot in place if you fall out during mid-match, although you also get an XP penalty, and it will correct scoring issues.

577
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:55,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no real price on the map pack yet, but as comparison, the combustible map pack is 800 Microsoft points.

578
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:03,470
[SPEAKER_02]: The maps that are coming with this, one's called Grindyard.

579
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:08,392
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a wintery junkyard processing plant thing.

580
00:43:08,812 --> 00:43:11,553
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be a spiritual successor to Gridlock.

581
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:18,896
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Underhill and Courtyard also, in addition to the Fuel Depot remake.

582
00:43:19,937 --> 00:43:20,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

583
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:23,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And Actdeft approves in our chatroom.

584
00:43:23,298 --> 00:43:26,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuel Depot was the best map of the first Gears of War, says Actdeft.

585
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:28,404
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably why they're bringing it back.

586
00:43:28,424 --> 00:43:30,646
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably why it's coming back for another round.

587
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:31,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

588
00:43:31,286 --> 00:43:32,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.

589
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:32,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here.

590
00:43:33,468 --> 00:43:34,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

591
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:38,032
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, people are going to be excited that they can increase their gamer score by another 250 points.

592
00:43:38,172 --> 00:43:39,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Here goes your EP.

593
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:42,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just want to say my EP hit a landmark today.

594
00:43:42,355 --> 00:43:42,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Just today.

595
00:43:43,356 --> 00:43:45,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I crossed 10,000 gamer score today.

596
00:43:45,737 --> 00:43:46,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo-hoo.

597
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:47,679
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll see you next time.

598
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:15,504
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apparently, there's a good use for some of your Xbox 360 systems that may be broken.

599
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:22,009
[SPEAKER_05]: One use, of course, would be to convert it into a bong, and that's what someone has done, actually.

600
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:25,832
[SPEAKER_05]: They have converted their Xbox 360 system into a bong.

601
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:34,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it doesn't work anymore, and I'm sure it's been gutted, but yes, now it is a bong, and you can smoke out of it.

602
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:35,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

603
00:44:36,453 --> 00:44:38,614
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course you would only smoke tobacco out of it, right?

604
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, because anything else would be illegal.

605
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:44,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, everybody smokes tobacco out of bongs.

606
00:44:46,158 --> 00:44:46,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

607
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:53,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I do know people who actually will do tobacco in a bong, but you can only do ginseng and other stuff.

608
00:44:53,682 --> 00:44:55,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that like a hookah type thing?

609
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:58,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty much like just a modified hookah, but it's the same difference.

610
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:03,007
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm looking at the picture of it and...

611
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:06,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do better with that.

612
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:09,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, would you really want to turn your Xbox 360 of all things into a bong?

613
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:11,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be calling it the Xbox 420.

614
00:45:11,144 --> 00:45:15,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to be honest, you wouldn't have to necessarily have an Xbox 360.

615
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:19,045
[SPEAKER_05]: You could buy a replacement case and it's like, just buy a bong.

616
00:45:19,085 --> 00:45:23,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, it's just, it's not even worth, you know, just getting a hookah.

617
00:45:24,866 --> 00:45:25,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, why bother?

618
00:45:25,967 --> 00:45:28,547
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, why bother other than, oh, look, I did that.

619
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:29,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

620
00:45:29,307 --> 00:45:31,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Now one person's converted their system into a bong.

621
00:45:31,588 --> 00:45:33,568
[SPEAKER_05]: No one else needs to do it because it's a waste of time.

622
00:45:35,237 --> 00:45:37,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I the only person here who's reminded of Dennis Leary?

623
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:39,281
[SPEAKER_06]: How so?

624
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:42,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying that smoking pot doesn't lead to other drugs, it leads to carpentry?

625
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:45,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

626
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:50,151
[SPEAKER_06]: AcidicVampire in chat says, if you use your 360 as a bong, you will see Yaris.

627
00:45:51,392 --> 00:45:52,013
[SPEAKER_06]: This is possible.

628
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:52,953
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very possible.

629
00:45:53,234 --> 00:45:53,594
[SPEAKER_07]: That would...

630
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,555
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, look, look.

631
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:57,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't turn your 360 into a bong.

632
00:45:57,516 --> 00:46:00,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it to work again so that you can get new games on it.

633
00:46:00,637 --> 00:46:05,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Although this game is not on the 360, but it's a developer that makes a lot of games for 360.

634
00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:08,400
[SPEAKER_06]: PopCap is giving away a free game.

635
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,500
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, a free game.

636
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:13,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a belief going on right now.

637
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:14,562
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a St.

638
00:46:14,602 --> 00:46:15,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Patrick's Day promotion.

639
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:18,543
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to go through March 24th.

640
00:46:19,163 --> 00:46:21,124
[SPEAKER_06]: The game you can get is Big Money.

641
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:24,586
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get the game for free on PopCap.

642
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:25,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So go check it out.

643
00:46:26,027 --> 00:46:26,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Big money.

644
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like the game Pop It, if you've ever played it with the balloons.

645
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:32,531
[SPEAKER_06]: You're basically trying to make...

646
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:38,647
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like four of the same color that touch and it has a money theme going to it.

647
00:46:39,768 --> 00:46:41,909
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like the balloon game if you ever played it.

648
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:44,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, don't you click them away in this one?

649
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:48,432
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see matches of four, you click on it and then they go away and everything compresses together.

650
00:46:48,693 --> 00:46:49,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's this one.

651
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:50,934
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how the balloon one is.

652
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:52,735
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

653
00:46:53,786 --> 00:46:58,189
[SPEAKER_06]: You click on them and then it compresses together and you don't want it to go past the top of the screen.

654
00:46:58,209 --> 00:46:59,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played this before, like a long time ago.

655
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,172
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's free, so now I can go play it again.

656
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:02,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlimited.

657
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:04,413
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have to get it before the 24th.

658
00:47:04,693 --> 00:47:05,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So, check it out.

659
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:07,673
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

660
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't Rhapsody already come out?

661
00:47:34,741 --> 00:47:35,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know

662
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:10,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhapsody, A Musical Adventure on DS, The Last Remnant on PC, The Wheelman on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

663
00:48:11,285 --> 00:48:11,686
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

664
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:15,788
[SPEAKER_05]: The US doesn't have much coming out, unfortunately, this week.

665
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:30,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting things off, of course, we have on the DS, and I think this held over from last week, but World Championship Games, the track and field event, it got delayed to Monday.

666
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's on the DS.

667
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:37,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Valkyrie Profile, Covenant of the Plume, also coming out on Monday on the DS.

668
00:48:38,365 --> 00:48:38,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesdays when we have most of the stuff coming out, including another DS game, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars.

670
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:52,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Also on the DS, Henry Hatsworth and a Puzzling Adventure, which is pretty cool, kind of combines puzzle and platforming there.

671
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:57,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Also on the DS, Mind, Body, and Soul, Big World Puzzle Book.

[SPEAKER_05]: Also have Rune Factory Frontier.

675
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:16,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And some more DS titles.

[SPEAKER_05]: We have on the DS and PSP, Scrabble.

[SPEAKER_05]: On PlayStation 2, SingStar Queen.

00:49:24,263 --> 00:49:24,544

[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and Men of War.

686
00:50:15,694 --> 00:50:16,074
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

687
00:50:16,234 --> 00:50:18,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty kind of lame release week.

688
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and on PSP, how could I forget this?

689
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually going to play this.

690
00:50:22,158 --> 00:50:23,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Resistance Retribution.

691
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:26,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait to check out the linking stuff on that.

692
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I can't wait to finish Resistance 2 since I haven't really played much of that.

693
00:50:30,603 --> 00:50:31,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, quick question for you.

694
00:50:31,703 --> 00:50:34,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely random, but since you know about games that are in demand and all that stuff.

695
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:37,707
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with the Retro Game Challenge?

696
00:50:37,727 --> 00:50:41,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to go to Best Buy to get it the other day and they said they had none in stock and they weren't expecting any more.

697
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:43,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a hard to find game now?

698
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:43,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess so.

699
00:50:45,131 --> 00:50:48,392
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Atlas, so Atlas puts out their games in very limited quantities.

700
00:50:49,472 --> 00:50:53,693
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of these places think it's going to be too niche of a title, and so they don't bring it in.

701
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people start asking for it, and then you can't find it.

702
00:50:58,634 --> 00:50:59,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

703
00:50:59,715 --> 00:51:03,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, because I actually was hearing Bobby say good things about it last week, and he's not the only one.

704
00:51:03,136 --> 00:51:08,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of my other friends are talking about how they enjoyed Retro Game Challenge, so I was actually going to pick it up on the DS, and then I can't find it.

705
00:51:09,392 --> 00:51:10,653
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

706
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:33,110
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the Nintendo Wii?

707
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you get some stuff for Japan.

708
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:43,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Darts Wii Deluxe, Monopoly Here and Now, the World Edition, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 All Play, and Winter Sports 2009 The Next Challenge.

709
00:51:43,673 --> 00:51:46,014
[SPEAKER_06]: All of those titles coming out on the 19th of March.

710
00:51:46,534 --> 00:51:47,135
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

711
00:52:16,889 --> 00:52:18,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I knew you were a big fan of Cookie Mama.

712
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:21,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather just cook it and have someone else do my gardening for me.

713
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:25,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

714
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:31,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out, Kuroshitsuji Phantom and Ghost comes out from Squeenix on the 19th of March.

715
00:52:32,397 --> 00:52:35,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Pets series also making its way to Japan.

716
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:38,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Cats, Dogs, Horses, and Monkeys.

717
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are all separate games making their release in Japan.

718
00:52:41,761 --> 00:52:43,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Zookeeper gets a price reduction.

719
00:52:43,222 --> 00:52:44,703
[SPEAKER_06]: That game's been out forever.

720
00:52:46,138 --> 00:52:47,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Ball Evolution Dragon Ball Evolution

721
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,700
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

722
00:53:38,573 --> 00:53:53,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, Amazon's been having a new deal now with their game downloads where you can basically buy a game to download for $9.99 or less according to their ad.

723
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:59,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And a bunch of game developers are not happy about it because they think that their games...

724
00:54:00,662 --> 00:54:01,763
[SPEAKER_02]: should be sold for more.

725
00:54:02,303 --> 00:54:09,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So PopCap and iWin actually pulled a lot of their games off of Amazon saying that it was completely unacceptable.

726
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:17,359
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, they'd want to put like Jewel Quest for $19.99 and think that $9.99 is way, way too low.

727
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,680
[SPEAKER_02]: That $20 is an acceptable price, $10 is not.

728
00:54:26,154 --> 00:54:30,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you can't get those anymore, and from what I understand, the rest of the selection is kind of ass.

729
00:54:32,021 --> 00:54:32,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

730
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,550
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a pretty cool...

731
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:43,422
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

732
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:00,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

733
00:55:19,464 --> 00:55:20,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Burnout Paradise

734
00:55:31,573 --> 00:55:33,054
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

735
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:54,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm keeping that shit, okay?

736
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:56,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I can understand that.

737
00:55:56,354 --> 00:56:01,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm not recycling crap because they're just going to put that back in a package and sell it to me again.

738
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:02,359
[SPEAKER_05]: No, screw it.

739
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:09,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to say that you can't take the glasses out of Disneyland either because they have the Honey, I Shrunk the Audience or whatever.

740
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:10,586
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get the 3D glasses for that.

741
00:56:10,846 --> 00:56:13,248
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they actually have a cast member waiting there for you to dump them off.

742
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:14,149
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

743
00:56:14,169 --> 00:56:16,031
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Muppet Show one's freaking awesome.

744
00:56:16,934 --> 00:56:17,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm keeping the glasses.

745
00:56:17,755 --> 00:56:18,637
[SPEAKER_05]: That I can understand.

746
00:56:18,697 --> 00:56:18,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well...

747
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:32,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess kind of changing topics here a little bit, talking about this story out of the UK.

748
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:36,854
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this campaign called the Change for Life campaign over in the UK.

749
00:56:38,054 --> 00:56:54,123
[SPEAKER_06]: What's interesting about this is it's trying to, I guess you could say it's a campaign, an ad campaign, trying to get folks to not play video games, basically insinuating that video games cause obesity, diabetes, cancer, and so on and so on, just all these bad things.

750
00:56:55,524 --> 00:56:57,305
[SPEAKER_06]: and basically trying to get people to go out and about.

751
00:56:57,785 --> 00:57:00,286
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, let me read the text on one of their ads here.

752
00:57:00,446 --> 00:57:01,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Risk an early death.

753
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:02,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Do nothing.

754
00:57:03,568 --> 00:57:07,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Nine out of ten kids risk growing up to have unhealthy amounts of fat in their bodies.

755
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:13,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you think they look healthy today, adult could bring an early death from heart disease, type 2 diabetes, or cancer.

756
00:57:13,592 --> 00:57:16,134
[SPEAKER_06]: So make sure your kids are active for an hour a day.

757
00:57:16,494 --> 00:57:17,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Reduce how much fat they eat.

758
00:57:17,974 --> 00:57:20,195
[SPEAKER_06]: For more advice, visit this website.

759
00:57:21,636 --> 00:57:29,121
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's interesting about this particular ad that I'm reading from in particular is it features a little kid sitting on the couch holding a PlayStation controller in their hand.

760
00:57:29,181 --> 00:57:31,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, I'm just sitting here lazy looking, you know.

761
00:57:31,202 --> 00:57:32,263
[SPEAKER_02]: A healthy looking kid, by the way.

762
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:32,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Half dead.

763
00:57:32,823 --> 00:57:40,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but he definitely looks bored playing PlayStation games, which, you know, there are quite a lot of boring PlayStation 3 games that are out right now.

764
00:57:40,968 --> 00:57:42,008
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that's not the problem.

765
00:57:42,048 --> 00:57:44,370
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on here, Sony's pissed about this.

766
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:50,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sony is to the point where they are actually thinking about possibly filing a lawsuit.

767
00:57:51,132 --> 00:57:58,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the agency who made the ad, The Gate, they did not get permission from Sony to use the controller in the ad.

768
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:09,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it is possible that they're talking about possibly Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is considering legal action against the folks that made the ad.

769
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:10,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the thing.

770
00:58:12,394 --> 00:58:14,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, kids need to get up off the couch.

771
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Kids should not sit and play video games all day.

772
00:58:19,178 --> 00:58:24,461
[SPEAKER_06]: What's there to say that video games aren't actually a healthy thing to incorporate into a lifestyle?

773
00:58:25,581 --> 00:58:27,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe an hour a day or a couple hours a week.

774
00:58:28,243 --> 00:58:32,265
[SPEAKER_06]: If you limit it in your kid's life, I don't think it's necessarily such a bad thing at all.

775
00:58:33,203 --> 00:58:34,504
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

776
00:58:58,143 --> 00:59:10,934
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also, though, not factoring in the fact that there are many people who may be clinically overweight who are actually in better health than, like, say that you've got the person who's in their BMI range, correct?

777
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:11,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

778
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:36,291
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't eat properly, they don't exercise, they can't lift much but you've got the person that maybe is say a little over their BMI which by the way BMI is bullshit, you know are overweight but yet they go out and you know bike, go swimming, do things, are active people and have much better cardiovascular system than the you know stupid little anorexic cheerleader type and

779
00:59:36,691 --> 00:59:45,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could also have someone incredibly muscle-bound who's the same BMI as someone 300 pounds overweight.

780
00:59:45,796 --> 00:59:53,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, you've got to look at the factors of biology, genetics, and more than that.

781
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:58,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sitting in front of the couch playing video games all day is not going to make you die.

782
00:59:59,404 --> 01:00:00,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Comments from chat.

783
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:02,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to read chat.orangelongeradio.com.

784
01:00:02,505 --> 01:00:05,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Xlink says, it's good hand-eye, but so is masturbation.

785
01:00:05,546 --> 01:00:05,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

786
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:09,306
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, go outside and play Dragon's Lair in the backyard.

787
01:00:10,547 --> 01:00:12,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbandit says, you can be fat and happy.

788
01:00:13,828 --> 01:00:14,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.

789
01:00:14,168 --> 01:00:17,869
[SPEAKER_06]: You can be fat and happy, but you just got to make sure you're not fat and unhealthy.

790
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:19,849
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a difference.

791
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:21,049
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be a triathlete.

792
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:23,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

793
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:27,391
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be a professional bicyclist and get cancer.

794
01:00:28,595 --> 01:00:29,196
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

795
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:29,697
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

796
01:00:29,738 --> 01:00:32,203
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be a triathlete who gets hit by a car.

797
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:33,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

798
01:00:33,786 --> 01:00:34,789
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what does it matter?

799
01:00:35,864 --> 01:00:37,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you die an ironic death.

800
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:45,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing is that I think a better ad might be instead of the big text up there that says risk an early death, do just nothing.

801
01:00:45,751 --> 01:00:49,374
[SPEAKER_06]: How about one that says stop using games to babysit your children?

802
01:00:50,235 --> 01:00:52,236
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be an effective ad in my opinion.

803
01:00:52,576 --> 01:00:55,659
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be one because the kid looks bored and everything.

804
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:58,901
[SPEAKER_06]: So how about stop using games to babysit your children?

805
01:00:59,538 --> 01:01:09,101
[SPEAKER_02]: A responsible parent is going to look beyond... And this is something that I've had to think of a lot myself lately.

806
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:15,104
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to be a responsible parent, you need to be 100% for your kid.

807
01:01:15,544 --> 01:01:18,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Including taking them outside to get them some activity.

808
01:01:19,205 --> 01:01:22,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Including telling them, you know, I think you've played enough.

809
01:01:22,786 --> 01:01:23,967
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to go do this now.

810
01:01:24,887 --> 01:01:31,132
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to set, you know, you have to do the things that are good for them, not just the things that are convenient for you.

811
01:01:31,712 --> 01:01:35,455
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an awfully nice way to phrase it as a parent, is that, you know, I think you've played enough.

812
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:38,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know my mom would have said, turn it off and go outside!

813
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:42,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what I mean.

814
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:44,162
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know what you mean.

815
01:01:44,822 --> 01:01:48,365
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom would be just like, you're not on that thing again, are you?

816
01:01:48,945 --> 01:01:51,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd go out and play, come back and she'd be playing my Nintendo.

817
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:53,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

818
01:01:55,592 --> 01:01:58,909
[SPEAKER_06]: that's how she got her turn go outside, it's my turn

819
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,441
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

820
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:01,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so we'll see what happens.

821
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,123
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if Sony does end up suing over this or not.

822
01:02:04,223 --> 01:02:06,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what's gonna end up happening.

823
01:02:06,644 --> 01:02:07,605
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who else will sue?

824
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:07,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Who?

825
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:09,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they won't.

826
01:02:09,746 --> 01:02:12,568
[SPEAKER_02]: But speaking of Sony, we have some stuff about Noby Noby Boy.

827
01:02:13,028 --> 01:02:13,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

828
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:21,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Takahashi Keita said that there's going to be an offline multiplayer mode on the way.

829
01:02:21,954 --> 01:02:25,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And that he wants people to enjoy the game, so they're working on an update.

830
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:27,297
[SPEAKER_02]: There's

831
01:02:28,938 --> 01:02:30,801
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all going to be, though, offline, though.

832
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:32,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically offline.

833
01:02:33,484 --> 01:02:33,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo.

834
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:38,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're saying that it should be roughly around the 18th of April.

835
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:39,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, not boo.

836
01:02:39,711 --> 01:02:45,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, multiplayer is better than none at all, but, you know, I wish, you know, it's not like the Sony's not connected to the internet, you know?

837
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:46,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

838
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So, whatever.

839
01:02:50,276 --> 01:02:50,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

840
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,591
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's interesting.

841
01:03:15,471 --> 01:03:20,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, a lot of people are familiar with GamePro, the magazine that's still around, surprisingly.

842
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:26,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, GamePro is actually going to publish indie games now under their new label, GamePro Labs.

843
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:33,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And you may see some of these games coming to XNA, PC, Zune, iPhone, etc.,

844
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:40,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they're going to sort of act as a middleman between indie devs and platform holders.

845
01:03:41,228 --> 01:03:49,973
[SPEAKER_05]: What's also interesting is GamePro has announced that they're planning to produce a free custom edition of its magazine for distribution exclusively at 7-Eleven.

846
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:56,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you get your Slurpee, you can get a free copy of your modified GamePro magazine.

847
01:03:59,072 --> 01:04:02,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this going to be an addition to the current subscription magazine?

848
01:04:02,813 --> 01:04:03,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

849
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:06,074
[SPEAKER_06]: How is a company like that growing in this economy?

850
01:04:06,094 --> 01:04:10,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to add as a further dib at the crap that is 7-Eleven.

851
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:16,036
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go pick up your free magazine when you're picking up a game that's broken street again.

852
01:04:16,376 --> 01:04:19,257
[SPEAKER_05]: You make it sound like it's an issue.

853
01:04:19,277 --> 01:04:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: 7-Eleven doesn't adhere street dates.

854
01:04:21,897 --> 01:04:24,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Nor do I. I know.

855
01:04:24,938 --> 01:04:25,798
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the problem?

856
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:27,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were in full support of this.

857
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:30,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in full support of Slurpees.

858
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:33,458
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn, if I became rich, I'm getting a Slurpee machine.

859
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:34,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss Vanilla Coke Slurpees.

860
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:35,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were the bomb.

861
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,763
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell do I have to do to get those to come back?

862
01:04:40,685 --> 01:04:42,667
[SPEAKER_06]: GamePro doing their own game publishing.

863
01:04:42,687 --> 01:04:44,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think we're going to see anything big come out of this?

864
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:44,429
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

865
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:49,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think it's just going to be of the caliber of the types of things that come free with a magazine?

866
01:04:51,075 --> 01:04:51,496
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

867
01:05:03,254 --> 01:05:06,517
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because they have to give away demos that are already available on live.

868
01:05:06,797 --> 01:05:07,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

869
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:08,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Demos!

870
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:09,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't download those.

871
01:05:09,899 --> 01:05:12,621
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I canceled my... See, here's the thing.

872
01:05:13,002 --> 01:05:17,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to subscribe to Xbox Magazine back when they used to have demos way before they ever came out.

873
01:05:17,685 --> 01:05:18,746
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like Saints Row.

874
01:05:19,006 --> 01:05:20,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was awesome.

875
01:05:20,107 --> 01:05:20,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Saints Row demo?

876
01:05:21,028 --> 01:05:21,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah!

877
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:22,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's like...

878
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:28,681
[SPEAKER_05]: demos for old shit that have been on live for a long time now.

879
01:05:29,222 --> 01:05:31,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no thanks, I don't need to subscribe to your magazine anymore.

880
01:05:31,882 --> 01:05:43,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I already get a free membership to stupid, well, not even technically free, but I get a membership to Game Informer because I have that stupid card at GameStop because, you know, it gives me an extra 10% or whatever.

881
01:05:44,526 --> 01:05:44,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

882
01:05:45,006 --> 01:05:47,507
[SPEAKER_05]: It's paid for itself, but hey, I get a magazine out of it.

883
01:05:47,547 --> 01:05:51,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, the magazine's not bad, so I'm not buying Xbox Magazine.

884
01:05:53,035 --> 01:05:54,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Salad Game Salad Game Salad

885
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

886
01:06:49,437 --> 01:06:52,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't like RPG Maker, it's still pretty good actually.

887
01:06:54,361 --> 01:06:56,322
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, it's not going to be any good at all.

888
01:06:56,722 --> 01:07:03,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, RPG Maker is pretty awesome, but I've seen some of these games that are hell like click and play.

889
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:06,488
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just so many limitations to it.

890
01:07:07,944 --> 01:07:10,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I think it's just... Well, here's the thing, though.

891
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just for shooters.

892
01:07:11,245 --> 01:07:13,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, some of the games they say have been made on this that are pretty good.

893
01:07:13,886 --> 01:07:19,187
[SPEAKER_06]: A game called Darkwood that's like a Zelda-ish type of RPG that was made by three students in a week's time.

894
01:07:20,087 --> 01:07:25,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And then DRFT, a 2D racing game that's kind of like the original Grand Theft Auto.

895
01:07:25,769 --> 01:07:30,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it sounds like everything that Click and Play could have done, because that's the type of stuff you could do in it.

896
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:31,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just...

897
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:37,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very limited and yeah, you can make these wonderful little racing games and stuff, but they're just not great.

898
01:07:37,776 --> 01:07:42,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope to God that you can't publish these on the Apple Store because that's all they want.

899
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:52,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put out a game making program so any idiot can create all this crap and then we can pad our numbers on the App Store and use that in our next commercial.

900
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:53,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

901
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:56,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Any idiot can make a podcast and get it listed on the iTunes Store.

902
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:57,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, how you doing?

903
01:07:57,654 --> 01:08:03,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but iTunes doesn't go, hey, we've got X million podcasts, look at us, we're so awesome.

904
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,021
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't really care.

905
01:08:07,123 --> 01:08:08,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple doesn't care about podcasts.

906
01:08:10,526 --> 01:08:14,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple doesn't care about a lot of things except getting you to buy their crappy products.

907
01:08:16,912 --> 01:08:19,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

908
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:21,276
[SPEAKER_06]: We're almost to the end of Part A of the Classic Game of the Week.

909
01:08:21,316 --> 01:08:23,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming up in just a little bit, we've got a couple more stories for you guys.

910
01:08:23,789 --> 01:08:24,590
[SPEAKER_02]: That we do.

911
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:28,633
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, something about Resident Evil 5.

912
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:44,768
[SPEAKER_02]: There's supposed to be a versus download content and it's supposed to be out for 160 Microsoft points or 250 yen on a PlayStation Network.

913
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:50,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which we're probably going to be getting it for twice as much or something like that.

914
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:54,474
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're basically saying in Japan it's going to be out, um, March 26th.

915
01:08:54,494 --> 01:08:54,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

916
01:08:59,585 --> 01:08:59,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

917
01:09:00,626 --> 01:09:01,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

918
01:09:03,107 --> 01:09:08,590
[SPEAKER_05]: So, of course, we were talking a little bit earlier about exclusives and that kind of stuff and mentioned Bioshock 2.

919
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:14,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, of course, this month in Game Informer, which also goes back to another story.

920
01:09:14,552 --> 01:09:16,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, we're transitioning from two different stories.

921
01:09:17,874 --> 01:09:22,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock 2 was the cover story and, of course, they revealed the big sister

922
01:09:27,939 --> 01:09:34,486
[SPEAKER_05]: and is a new Big Daddy-esque creature that you're going to be fighting against in the game.

923
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:49,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there are no real details, at least, leaked out yet about what exactly you're going to be doing, but the second game, apparently, you will be playing as the first Big Daddy, the original Big Daddy.

924
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:49,901
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

925
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,380
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be an awesome game.

926
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:22,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock 1 was really sweet, and I can't see that it's going to be any less than that.

927
01:10:27,802 --> 01:10:29,623
[SPEAKER_06]: This game has an awful lot to live up to.

928
01:10:29,703 --> 01:10:30,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it's going to meet the hype?

929
01:10:31,363 --> 01:10:31,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it will.

930
01:10:32,163 --> 01:10:34,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're going to have to do some interesting stuff with it.

931
01:10:34,324 --> 01:10:36,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that it was going to be more above ground and stuff like that.

932
01:10:37,304 --> 01:10:45,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that you're playing as a big daddy from the beginning is kind of... I'm not too sure if I like that idea, but we'll see.

933
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:47,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

934
01:10:49,231 --> 01:10:52,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, hey, let's take a trip back to the past here.

935
01:10:52,392 --> 01:11:00,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about the Classic Game of the Week just yet, but here's the interesting thing is that the Genesis, of course, is a system that's been featured many times in the Classic Game of the Week.

936
01:11:01,235 --> 01:11:04,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there is this new kind of like...

937
01:11:05,456 --> 01:11:07,097
[SPEAKER_06]: 3rd Party Sega Genesis

938
01:11:21,946 --> 01:11:27,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Going for about $53 and with the system comes about 15 games.

939
01:11:27,512 --> 01:11:30,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic & Knuckles, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd, Golden Axe.

940
01:11:31,216 --> 01:11:33,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So all these old school games.

941
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:36,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess this is what you start to see as these consoles age.

942
01:11:36,602 --> 01:11:42,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the patents expire or something like that and now third party remake these old ass consoles which is interesting.

943
01:11:43,209 --> 01:11:47,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And the best part about this though, because they did release something before, they've done handhelds and that kind of thing.

944
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:54,700
[SPEAKER_05]: The best part about this though is that it does have its own cartridge slot that will play Mega Drive and Genesis games.

945
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,463
[SPEAKER_06]: So not only do you have the 15 that are built in, but you can put in new ones.

946
01:11:57,963 --> 01:11:58,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

947
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:58,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

948
01:12:00,726 --> 01:12:01,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

949
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:05,450
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, now what we're going to do, we're going to take a trip back to the past.

950
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:08,231
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if DarkSakura has picked a Genesis game this week.

951
01:12:08,271 --> 01:12:09,192
[SPEAKER_06]: She might have picked something else.

952
01:12:09,512 --> 01:12:10,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in a while.

953
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:19,199
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's take a trip down memory lane and see what the classic game of the week is that all you kids should check out this week by DarkSakura.

954
01:12:20,951 --> 01:12:38,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the secret, the secret, the game of the week is Secret of Mana, which was known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2, and I picked music for it that is actually some of the overworld music, which is my favorite.

955
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:41,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I thought we were going to do a little...

956
01:12:56,864 --> 01:13:09,832
[SPEAKER_02]: The game came out, it was actually developed by Square, which is now Squeenix, and came out on the Super Nintendo, and we eventually got it on Virtual Console.

957
01:13:11,093 --> 01:13:13,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually, as I said, it's Seiken Densetsu 2.

958
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:18,778
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one was called Seiken Densetsu Final Fantasy Gaiden for the Game Boy.

959
01:13:19,538 --> 01:13:21,499
[SPEAKER_02]: and we got into Final Fantasy Adventure.

960
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of an interesting little game there.

961
01:13:26,462 --> 01:13:32,606
[SPEAKER_02]: But going back to Secret of Mana, it didn't use the turn-based system.

962
01:13:32,926 --> 01:13:37,729
[SPEAKER_02]: It used a real-time battle, more like how it was in Zelda.

963
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:48,256
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also had an AI that you could actually control to be either attacking, defense, or somewhere in the middle.

964
01:13:49,062 --> 01:13:53,143
[SPEAKER_02]: and a second player could come in and play one of your other characters.

965
01:13:53,604 --> 01:13:55,644
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty much a two-player RPG.

966
01:13:56,205 --> 01:14:01,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally have not tried to do it with the multi-tap to see if you could do three people.

967
01:14:01,946 --> 01:14:03,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anyone has, let me know.

968
01:14:04,727 --> 01:14:06,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It just never occurred to me until I was an adult.

969
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:14,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So the game itself in the American version is...

970
01:14:17,514 --> 01:14:46,008
[SPEAKER_02]: basically you're kicked out of town and you have to go and you hook up with a princess and a sprite and you run around trying to get a different well first of all you get your experience in battle and you level up and you can level up your spells as you you know as you attract them and by the way the multi-tap does work thought I would mention that and the virtual console version will let you use three people

971
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:55,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, you have to rescue different elementals, and they give you different attacks, different skills, different things that you can do.

972
01:14:57,698 --> 01:15:04,123
[SPEAKER_02]: But the magic is your party's mana power, which will increase as the game goes on.

973
01:15:04,924 --> 01:15:10,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So, really, it's just you go through different places.

974
01:15:11,129 --> 01:15:12,550
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also get flammy.

975
01:15:13,911 --> 01:15:14,672
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember flammy?

976
01:15:16,376 --> 01:15:19,158
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing I put on there, Rob, was Flammy's music.

977
01:15:19,178 --> 01:15:21,039
[SPEAKER_06]: The best way I can describe Flammy is...

978
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:35,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like Falkor from The NeverEnding Story.

979
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:37,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it's the same concept.

980
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:43,021
[SPEAKER_02]: You ride on this big white dragon thingy's back, and then you can land in different places.

981
01:15:43,441 --> 01:15:45,542
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, it's Mode 7-tastic!

982
01:15:47,503 --> 01:15:57,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you can go over the background and you can move and the map will move with you and you can land and it's pretty cool.

983
01:15:57,832 --> 01:16:00,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's just a cool little game.

984
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:06,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's funny though the way that you call them is by doing the little drum with the balls on the string.

985
01:16:06,098 --> 01:16:06,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that.

986
01:16:06,499 --> 01:16:07,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot what they're called.

987
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:12,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but anyway, it's super cool.

988
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:20,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then at the end you get the mana sword, and you kick ass, and game over.

989
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:35,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the game was designed by, um, uh, Ishii Koichi, um, and, um, was actually, um, released after Final Fantasy III, um,

990
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:47,196
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to actually use the system from Final Fantasy IV, but it wouldn't work in the series, so they did it all for Secret of Mana.

991
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:56,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally going to be an SNES CD add-on, but when they dropped that, they just did it all to fit on the cartridge.

992
01:16:56,463 --> 01:16:59,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had one of the faster localizations.

993
01:16:59,725 --> 01:17:02,567
[SPEAKER_02]: It only took 30 days to translate the game.

994
01:17:04,515 --> 01:17:08,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got it.

995
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:16,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also stated that they were going to bring it out for the Wonderswan Color.

996
01:17:17,004 --> 01:17:23,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And they cancelled it when Square decided to tell Bondi WTF, we don't like you anymore.

997
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:25,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

998
01:17:29,523 --> 01:17:33,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's really, it's been one of the, I think, most popular games.

999
01:17:33,908 --> 01:17:39,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been considered by Nintendo Power, it was number 42 in their top 200 games of all time.

1000
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:43,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of my favorites.

1001
01:17:43,619 --> 01:17:50,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually because of this that I went nuts trying to find Seiken Densetsu 3 and played the most of it on...

1002
01:17:51,347 --> 01:17:56,009
[SPEAKER_02]: on a fully translated mom hack I wish I could find again.

1003
01:17:56,449 --> 01:17:58,189
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really, it's a very worthwhile game.

1004
01:17:58,209 --> 01:18:07,572
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't played it, play the hell out of it and then play Seiken Densetsu 3 because it just evolves on the awesome.

1005
01:18:07,592 --> 01:18:08,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So go for it.

1006
01:18:08,733 --> 01:18:09,673
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my game.

1007
01:18:09,753 --> 01:18:12,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know why I hadn't reviewed this earlier.

1008
01:18:13,594 --> 01:18:14,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1009
01:18:14,475 --> 01:18:18,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Well there it is, your classic game of the week, Secret of Mana and what a classic game it is.

1010
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:22,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if they'll ever be highlighting Secret of Evermore

1011
01:18:44,113 --> 01:18:46,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well we are going to take a break here.

1012
01:18:46,219 --> 01:18:50,550
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio coming up though in Orange Lounge Radio Part B. So stay tuned.

1013
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:51,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't go anywhere.

1014
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:52,555
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be right back.

1015
01:18:58,888 --> 01:19:13,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March the 15th of 2009, where we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night on allgames.com, All Games Radio, bringing you lots and lots of great gaming shows throughout the week.

1016
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:23,128
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on right after another great gaming show called The Bobby Blackwolf Show, and we run for about three hours until we're tired and we want to go home, is basically how long we do the show.

1017
01:19:23,769 --> 01:19:24,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Snake360Light.com

1018
01:19:50,587 --> 01:19:52,167
[SPEAKER_06]: on Xbox Live Marketplace.

1019
01:19:52,608 --> 01:19:57,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the same game as pretty much was up there before, except now it's half the price.

1020
01:19:57,969 --> 01:20:02,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, of course, since it is half the price, there's a little less features than what you have in the full game.

1021
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:13,453
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I guess you get some two different multiplayer modes now, three single-player courses, three difficulty levels, multiple control schemes, just like in the other game.

1022
01:20:13,773 --> 01:20:17,694
[SPEAKER_06]: You still get some of the soundtrack from the same recording, and so on and so on.

1023
01:20:17,794 --> 01:20:17,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1024
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:19,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool.

1025
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:19,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Check that out.

1026
01:20:19,796 --> 01:20:21,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Support independent game development.

1027
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:22,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Snake360 Lite.

1028
01:20:22,461 --> 01:20:25,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, now we're going to get back into some other gaming news.

1029
01:20:25,807 --> 01:20:26,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Loki?

1030
01:20:26,589 --> 01:20:27,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we are.

1031
01:20:28,172 --> 01:20:29,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Some pretty cool stuff...

1032
01:20:31,425 --> 01:20:32,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, this is kind of weird.

1033
01:20:33,026 --> 01:20:39,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has addressed complaints that they had not that many games coming out.

1034
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:41,790
[SPEAKER_05]: They're low output of first party titles.

1035
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:51,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, it says this year, Nintendo seems to be getting some more games coming out, including the equally awaited Punch-Out!!

1036
01:20:51,974 --> 01:20:52,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, they've just...

1037
01:20:54,468 --> 01:20:54,968
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1038
01:21:22,073 --> 01:21:23,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, well, we don't know what to do.

1039
01:21:24,055 --> 01:21:28,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So now that they're putting out more games, they're trying to make sure people are going to be happy.

1040
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,502
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing, though, you ask me...

1041
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:31,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1042
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:56,094
[SPEAKER_05]: That does not count.

1043
01:21:56,414 --> 01:21:57,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Putting old things in new packaging.

1044
01:21:58,316 --> 01:21:59,117
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't count at all.

1045
01:21:59,437 --> 01:22:02,179
[SPEAKER_05]: ExciteBots and PunchOut.

1046
01:22:02,259 --> 01:22:03,981
[SPEAKER_05]: That does count because those are brand new.

1047
01:22:04,581 --> 01:22:08,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But these new play control games, I'm sorry, I'm getting a little sick of them.

1048
01:22:08,885 --> 01:22:11,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've just started coming out, but just tell people to stop buying them.

1049
01:22:12,007 --> 01:22:14,449
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing is, that's all that's coming out now.

1050
01:22:14,509 --> 01:22:17,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, people are so hungry for Nintendo games.

1051
01:22:17,652 --> 01:22:19,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh god, I want a new Pikmin game.

1052
01:22:20,294 --> 01:22:22,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now you're going to buy the re-release of Pikmin 1 and 2.

1053
01:22:24,261 --> 01:22:26,561
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru in our chatroom says Punch Out is very much a remake.

1054
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:52,844
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, but it is adding new characters.

1055
01:22:52,964 --> 01:22:56,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not so much, you know, it may be a remake, but it's not a port.

1056
01:22:56,968 --> 01:23:02,914
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a Super Nintendo game, too, and it's at least kind of redone from the ground up, and there are some new things in it.

1057
01:23:03,034 --> 01:23:03,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not a port.

1058
01:23:04,015 --> 01:23:09,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like, oh, I took the GameCube game, didn't really change anything to it, and then just poured it over.

1059
01:23:09,521 --> 01:23:14,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, you know, Pikmin 1 and Mario Power Tennis, they didn't really add anything to it.

1060
01:23:15,186 --> 01:23:41,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Donkey Kong Jungle Beat from what I hear they're adding some additional levels I don't know if it was in the Japanese version or if these are brand new levels but they're adding something to it and then Pikmin 2 are supposed to have two different types of Pikmin that weren't originally in the game so they are adding something to it but still it's a port of a game that's been out for a long time now GS68 in chat asks where's my new play control Custer's Revenge

1061
01:23:42,216 --> 01:23:43,337
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't on the GameCube.

1062
01:23:44,017 --> 01:23:47,320
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't, but maybe it's a game he's thinking needs to make a comeback.

1063
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:47,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1064
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:49,041
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, look.

1065
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:56,506
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to look for some new Wii games that actually look kind of interesting and you want to talk about a remake, I don't know if this is really a remake, though.

1066
01:23:56,726 --> 01:23:59,949
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like a reinvention completely of the old game Pong.

1067
01:23:59,969 --> 01:24:06,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to actually play a little clip here from the little trailer that we have here in studio because this actually looks kind of neat.

1068
01:24:06,954 --> 01:24:11,537
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a... Let me see if I can play a little clip here.

1069
01:24:14,073 --> 01:24:15,879
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a music based game.

1070
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:20,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Bit Trip Beat and it's by a company called Axis.

1071
01:24:23,311 --> 01:24:45,270
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's actually coming out to WiiWare on Monday and it's like all these little pong balls consistently are coming at your little paddle and you have to bounce them back and when you do it makes little beat music like the like 8-bit weapon type of chiptunes music that's what I was looking for um I guess this game's coming out it's gonna be 600 points here's the thing the controls you just tilt the control back and forth you tilt the little Wiimote back and forth

1072
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:46,452
[SPEAKER_06]: This should be on the DS.

1073
01:25:01,405 --> 01:25:03,587
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I like the idea of only having to pay $6 for this.

1074
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:04,848
[SPEAKER_06]: But this should be on the DS.

1075
01:25:05,508 --> 01:25:05,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1076
01:25:05,909 --> 01:25:07,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe if this does well, it will be.

1077
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:12,694
[SPEAKER_06]: But this boss stage looks just like a freaking regular breakout or something like that.

1078
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:13,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

1079
01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:13,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Trippy.

1080
01:25:14,456 --> 01:25:14,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Very trippy.

1081
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:17,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Hence the name.

1082
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:19,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1083
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can check that out.

1084
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be out on WeWare on Monday, it sounds like.

1085
01:25:22,262 --> 01:25:24,284
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time most of you hear this podcast, it'll already be out.

1086
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:28,668
[SPEAKER_06]: ActDeft in chat says, BitTripBeat is basically Pong and Rez's bastard child.

1087
01:25:28,968 --> 01:25:29,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of.

1088
01:25:30,069 --> 01:25:30,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of.

1089
01:25:32,935 --> 01:25:37,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have bad, bad news.

1090
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:39,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, not really bad news.

1091
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:40,341
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1092
01:25:41,381 --> 01:25:52,370
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not likely news, but Capcom US is hoping that we get a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which I think would be freaking fantastic.

1093
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:55,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I mean, it's got Gatchaman.

1094
01:25:55,972 --> 01:25:56,853
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do you need, right?

1095
01:25:56,873 --> 01:25:56,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1096
01:25:59,026 --> 01:26:10,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're saying, um, it was basically a quote by Christian Svensson, um, who is the developer, the business developer and strategic planning VP at Capcom said, do not rule out, um, do not rule a Western release out.

1097
01:26:10,997 --> 01:26:12,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I can say right now.

1098
01:26:12,318 --> 01:26:14,620
[SPEAKER_02]: We are still actively working on having that happening.

1099
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say it's happening.

1100
01:26:16,081 --> 01:26:16,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

1101
01:26:16,902 --> 01:26:20,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't give you a time, but as badly as the fans want it, we want to bring it.

1102
01:26:21,025 --> 01:26:23,868
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem that they're running into is what do we all say?

1103
01:26:23,948 --> 01:26:25,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Licensing, right?

1104
01:26:29,254 --> 01:26:33,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Tatsunoko rights are actually split among several companies in the U.S.

1105
01:26:33,879 --> 01:26:37,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, of course, in Japan, Tatsunoko Pro has all of them.

1106
01:26:38,123 --> 01:26:39,104
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about it.

1107
01:26:39,564 --> 01:26:47,092
[SPEAKER_02]: But here, it's like, you know, whoever had, you know, Gatchaman 2 has Eagle Riders here.

1108
01:26:47,532 --> 01:26:49,134
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was Battle of the Planets.

1109
01:26:49,274 --> 01:26:50,795
[SPEAKER_02]: There was G-Force.

1110
01:26:51,636 --> 01:26:52,577
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1111
01:27:13,556 --> 01:27:17,998
[SPEAKER_02]: in later anime, home releases, different things like that.

1112
01:27:18,998 --> 01:27:23,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even people who just thought about bringing it out over here and paid the licensing rights.

1113
01:27:23,259 --> 01:27:24,020
[SPEAKER_02]: That does happen.

1114
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:37,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a pain to get everything together, so they're actually going to have to do a lot of work for us to get the game over here, and it's all down to freaking licensing.

1115
01:27:39,326 --> 01:27:40,147
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1116
01:28:00,267 --> 01:28:02,449
[SPEAKER_06]: These are originally our characters, so forget it.

1117
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:05,913
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess, sadly, in a sue-happy world, that's not what can be done.

1118
01:28:06,834 --> 01:28:12,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the way that it is is that once Tatsunoko's given up the rights, they have to abide by contract.

1119
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:13,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I get it.

1120
01:28:13,902 --> 01:28:14,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sucks.

1121
01:28:14,503 --> 01:28:19,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and Tatsunoko Pro, I don't think, really has any holdings in the U.S., so it'd be nice.

1122
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:21,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So then they couldn't be sued in a U.S.

1123
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:22,250
[SPEAKER_06]: court.

1124
01:28:23,711 --> 01:28:29,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But Tatsunoko wouldn't legally be able to give the approval, which they clearly did in Japan.

1125
01:28:29,234 --> 01:28:31,895
[SPEAKER_02]: They just would not legally be able to do approval in the United States.

1126
01:28:32,236 --> 01:28:32,896
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know.

1127
01:28:32,956 --> 01:28:33,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

1128
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:33,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sucks.

1129
01:28:34,557 --> 01:28:34,877
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

1130
01:28:34,897 --> 01:28:35,437
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sucks.

1131
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:38,851
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1132
01:28:58,106 --> 01:29:04,730
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get, uh, what's his name from, oh, you know, Frank West from, uh, you know, Dead Rising in there and stuff as a character?

1133
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:05,830
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1134
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:07,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, sadly, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

1135
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:08,332
[SPEAKER_02]: They need Gatchaman Fighter.

1136
01:29:08,812 --> 01:29:09,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

1137
01:29:09,032 --> 01:29:10,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Gatchaman.

1138
01:29:10,233 --> 01:29:10,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1139
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:19,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And they need to make it for me, specifically, and say, because Jamie demanded it, we give you... And it would actually say that in the opening credits.

1140
01:29:19,178 --> 01:29:19,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1141
01:29:19,999 --> 01:29:22,320
[SPEAKER_02]: We give you Gatchaman the Battle.

1142
01:29:24,307 --> 01:29:27,468
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I would be very gratified as a fangirl.

1143
01:29:48,812 --> 01:29:50,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident Evil Remake Resident Evil Classics

1144
01:30:18,643 --> 01:30:28,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if that's going to be a new play control game or something like that, but that's going to be coming out for a $30 price point.

1145
01:30:32,055 --> 01:30:33,156
[SPEAKER_02]: The studio is haunted.

1146
01:30:39,282 --> 01:30:41,484
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having the attack of the random beeping noise.

1147
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:50,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, just give that to me.

1148
01:30:50,739 --> 01:30:51,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn that off.

1149
01:30:51,942 --> 01:30:53,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio, everybody.

1150
01:30:53,466 --> 01:30:54,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my sensor bar.

1151
01:30:54,709 --> 01:30:55,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Batteries are going out.

1152
01:30:56,624 --> 01:30:57,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that, guys.

1153
01:31:20,846 --> 01:31:22,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you were going to say Showgirls.

1154
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,233
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1155
01:32:01,761 --> 01:32:02,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, forget it

1156
01:32:23,334 --> 01:32:24,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Tree Run Super Sandwich

1157
01:32:51,313 --> 01:32:54,635
[SPEAKER_05]: The game looks crazy and Nellie keeps asking me when it's coming out.

1158
01:32:55,915 --> 01:32:58,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't know, right?

1159
01:32:58,477 --> 01:33:00,078
[SPEAKER_05]: The 22nd or 20th of April?

1160
01:33:00,538 --> 01:33:01,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1161
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:04,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too far out.

1162
01:33:04,901 --> 01:33:06,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's time for a birthday present.

1163
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:07,743
[SPEAKER_02]: For me!

1164
01:33:07,763 --> 01:33:10,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always got to be about you now, doesn't it?

1165
01:33:10,724 --> 01:33:12,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it always must be about me.

1166
01:33:13,606 --> 01:33:16,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to have the show's ego after all.

1167
01:33:17,444 --> 01:33:24,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, how about something related to Namco, maybe?

1168
01:33:25,286 --> 01:33:25,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1169
01:33:26,747 --> 01:33:32,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Namco has actually registered Excalibur as a trademark.

1170
01:33:34,569 --> 01:33:44,291
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really saying much about it, but it actually has an ESRB listing some achievements revealed.

1171
01:33:44,471 --> 01:33:45,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, the registered trademark.

1172
01:33:47,192 --> 01:34:12,826
[SPEAKER_02]: um and so it's there Namco Bandai is releasing Excalibur so of course the theory is that you know it's about King Arthur but maybe it's another in the Soul Calibur family or maybe a fighting game using the same engine or a remake of that old game Excalibur 2555 AD um

1173
01:34:15,908 --> 01:34:19,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling that whatever it is, it's going to be lame and disappointing.

1174
01:34:21,971 --> 01:34:23,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be about Pac-Man.

1175
01:34:24,272 --> 01:34:25,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

1176
01:34:25,552 --> 01:34:26,493
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's Namco for you.

1177
01:34:26,533 --> 01:34:28,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either going to be really awesome or really lame.

1178
01:34:28,594 --> 01:34:30,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's usually nothing in between.

1179
01:34:32,255 --> 01:34:33,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm voting really lame.

1180
01:34:35,229 --> 01:34:35,770
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1181
01:34:51,625 --> 01:35:02,239
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Caliber is the storyline based on fighters that have dropped out of the Soul Calibur series and now have to find real daytime jobs, including working fast food restaurants.

1182
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:02,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

1183
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:04,782
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Caliber.

1184
01:35:04,882 --> 01:35:05,423
[SPEAKER_05]: You're funny.

1185
01:35:07,608 --> 01:35:08,689
[SPEAKER_02]: What a fun guy.

1186
01:35:08,829 --> 01:35:10,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha.

1187
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:17,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it's a fighting game featuring all the exes in the relationship.

1188
01:35:17,254 --> 01:35:19,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I think now's a good time to just go to the next story, Loki.

1189
01:35:20,216 --> 01:35:20,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stop now.

1190
01:35:22,785 --> 01:35:26,028
[SPEAKER_05]: We do know what this game is though, Wii Rock Drum King.

1191
01:35:26,108 --> 01:35:28,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a brand new drumming game for the Wii.

1192
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:35,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, not using any actual peripherals other than the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, or possibly two remotes if you have those.

1193
01:35:35,976 --> 01:35:47,186
[SPEAKER_05]: What it does have though is a pretty cool song list, and the track list was revealed this week, including some stuff that you would not normally see in a music game like this.

1194
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:49,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel Good Inc.

1195
01:35:49,353 --> 01:35:49,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Gorillaz

1196
01:36:06,689 --> 01:36:14,272
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the weird ones that was in there, they had Organ Donor, the instrumental version by DJ Shadow.

1197
01:36:14,792 --> 01:36:18,313
[SPEAKER_05]: You normally wouldn't see that in a rock game like this.

1198
01:36:18,993 --> 01:36:32,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other songs that are in there as well, they have All Star by Smash Mouth, No One Knows by the Queens of the Stone Age, The Takeover, The Breaksover by Fall Out Boy, and

1199
01:36:35,054 --> 01:36:42,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't Stand Losing You by The Police, Spoon Man by Soundgarden, and Click Click Boom by Saliva.

1200
01:36:49,369 --> 01:36:49,769
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1201
01:36:49,809 --> 01:36:51,931
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was still tempted to get Rock Revolution this week.

1202
01:36:51,971 --> 01:36:52,491
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only $20.

1203
01:36:52,772 --> 01:36:54,133
[SPEAKER_06]: There's tons of them sitting on the shelf.

1204
01:36:54,173 --> 01:36:57,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost thinking it's going to drop to $9.99 before too long.

1205
01:36:57,855 --> 01:36:58,776
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when I'll have to get it.

1206
01:36:58,796 --> 01:37:05,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't drop officially to $9.99, but just let it sit there and fester a while, and it's eventually going to drop down.

1207
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:09,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So bad, they actually canceled the Wii version of Rock Revolution.

1208
01:37:10,104 --> 01:37:10,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

1209
01:37:11,025 --> 01:37:15,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was actually supposedly slated for April, still coming out at $50 retail.

1210
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:17,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, no one's going to buy that.

1211
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:18,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1212
01:37:19,111 --> 01:37:20,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, they just canceled it.

1213
01:37:20,573 --> 01:37:20,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1214
01:37:21,214 --> 01:37:23,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if there's sales figures on how much that game actually sold.

1215
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:25,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure there are.

1216
01:37:26,081 --> 01:37:28,462
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I have an idea where to look.

1217
01:37:29,103 --> 01:37:33,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, while you do that, let me talk about some other games that aren't necessarily just there to be sold.

1218
01:37:34,346 --> 01:37:35,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually kind of neat.

1219
01:37:35,506 --> 01:37:36,487
[SPEAKER_06]: This is over in Japan.

1220
01:37:36,527 --> 01:37:42,851
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Nintendo Game Seminar program, and if you're a student of this, you get to make your own DS game, basically, as a part of the program.

1221
01:37:43,171 --> 01:37:49,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Nintendo has actually taken these games that were created, and now they're available at DS download stations throughout Japan.

1222
01:37:49,675 --> 01:37:52,837
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can also get them through the Wii Nintendo channel.

1223
01:37:53,217 --> 01:37:54,517
[SPEAKER_06]: There's four games available.

1224
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:59,819
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is a mic-controlled game in which you blow to kind of create air that sends stars up in the sky.

1225
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:09,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one is where you are a voice artist that reads lines, and then when they're played back, they're given by like a weird character on screen, a random one or something.

1226
01:38:10,783 --> 01:38:18,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one is an action game where you move around and you pose, but I'm not sure exactly how that's done because they didn't say these were for the DSi, although...

1227
01:38:19,406 --> 01:38:20,507
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1228
01:38:43,624 --> 01:38:46,247
[SPEAKER_06]: and not just that, but now they have kind of a way to get it out there.

1229
01:38:46,267 --> 01:38:48,689
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost kind of like a little bit XNA-ish.

1230
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:59,179
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if that's something, maybe this is a sign that Nintendo might use the DSi download service for this or some of their other distribution channels, but that is kind of an interesting thought, right?

1231
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1232
01:39:02,082 --> 01:39:04,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it could just be a bunch of crapware, I don't know.

1233
01:39:05,316 --> 01:39:06,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1234
01:39:26,899 --> 01:39:31,163
[SPEAKER_05]: 0.5 million copies were sold for the Xbox 360 version.

1235
01:39:31,664 --> 01:39:33,586
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the highest of the three.

1236
01:39:33,606 --> 01:39:34,447
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not bad.

1237
01:39:34,507 --> 01:39:36,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a half million, right?

1238
01:39:36,129 --> 01:39:36,709
[SPEAKER_06]: 0.5 million or 0.05?

1239
01:39:36,749 --> 01:39:37,009
[SPEAKER_06]: 0.05 million.

1240
01:39:37,029 --> 01:39:37,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so 50,000 copies.

1241
01:39:43,096 --> 01:40:03,690
[SPEAKER_05]: and that is the best one out of all three versions the PS3 version sold .02 million copies or 20,000 and then finally the DS version only sold 10,000 copies well that's sad because the DS version seemed like the only one that made sense out of the bunch

1242
01:40:04,844 --> 01:40:06,605
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1243
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:35,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me giggle inside in a painful way.

1244
01:40:35,895 --> 01:40:37,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we get any emails of substance?

1245
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:39,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1246
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:39,760
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1247
01:40:42,623 --> 01:40:45,747
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, this is, it says, So this is a multiple email.

1248
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:56,274
[SPEAKER_02]: First, where are my shows and two, boy, do I have a slew of reviews for you.

1249
01:40:56,995 --> 01:41:13,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, alright, first, Tony Hawk's Project 8, another Tony Hawk title for the PSP, but this time around, it is a bit more challenging, no auto-kick, the story is cheesy as always, but anyways, it's awesome, and if you are a skater, wanna be by this.

1250
01:41:16,029 --> 01:41:17,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I really can't read this.

1251
01:41:18,729 --> 01:41:19,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm looking at this.

1252
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:21,091
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it was written on a PSP.

1253
01:41:23,313 --> 01:41:24,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try.

1254
01:41:24,895 --> 01:41:25,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1255
01:41:26,336 --> 01:41:29,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to translate into English, okay?

1256
01:41:29,839 --> 01:41:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that be fine?

1257
01:41:32,068 --> 01:41:33,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Wipeout Pure.

1258
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:40,296
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us kids who own a DS and owned a GBA know of F-Zero and GX.

1259
01:41:41,017 --> 01:41:44,320
[SPEAKER_02]: They have not released anything for a long time, and I own a PSP.

1260
01:41:44,981 --> 01:41:46,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that it would be a good idea.

1261
01:41:47,283 --> 01:41:50,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, it was, and I'll tell you, it was more of a challenge than F-Zero.

1262
01:41:51,167 --> 01:41:53,630
[SPEAKER_02]: GTA Liberty City... Okay.

1263
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:57,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you're thinking, what a 15 year old is doing with a GTA game.

1264
01:41:57,192 --> 01:42:01,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it on Amazon using my debit card and got it a few weeks.

1265
01:42:01,434 --> 01:42:03,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I popped it in and I instantly love it.

1266
01:42:03,035 --> 01:42:07,338
[SPEAKER_02]: The custom soundtrack stuff takes some work, but once you do it, it's awesome.

1267
01:42:07,718 --> 01:42:13,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing police from my safe house with a sniper rifle and racking up a 6 star rating is so fun.

1268
01:42:13,621 --> 01:42:16,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely recommend it to a first time PSP buyer.

1269
01:42:17,043 --> 01:42:19,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Lords of Dogtown, I Love Skateboarding and Surfing Stuff.

1270
01:42:20,325 --> 01:42:27,130
[SPEAKER_02]: This movie combined a little bit of both with a story about Jay Adams, Tony Alva, and Stacey Peralta.

1271
01:42:27,570 --> 01:42:28,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1272
01:42:28,671 --> 01:42:29,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, last thing.

1273
01:42:30,032 --> 01:42:30,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one question.

1274
01:42:30,752 --> 01:42:37,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys ever heard of Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System or the Neo Geo CD, King of Fighters is Better Than Street Fighter, Peace Out, DS Lover?

1275
01:42:38,337 --> 01:42:45,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, first of all, I own a Neo Geo and I have a Neo Geo CD as well and I have

1276
01:42:47,725 --> 01:42:55,224
[SPEAKER_02]: A Neo Geo Pocket Color and a Neo Geo Pocket So I'm really not sure which one you're asking about But King of Fighters

1277
01:42:59,312 --> 01:43:00,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on what you're into.

1278
01:43:01,093 --> 01:43:02,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the King of Fighters series.

1279
01:43:02,534 --> 01:43:05,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, talk about your cheap bitches and hard to pull off attacks.

1280
01:43:05,957 --> 01:43:10,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Street Fighter is a little bit more gratifying to play, but King of Fighters is just a little bit more.

1281
01:43:11,921 --> 01:43:14,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there's a bit more of a fun factor involved with the King of Fighters games.

1282
01:43:15,043 --> 01:43:21,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do have to say that if you've got it on the Neo Geo, you've got it arcade perfect and you have also paid for it.

1283
01:43:22,188 --> 01:43:24,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all I can say about that.

1284
01:43:25,331 --> 01:43:25,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob?

1285
01:43:26,952 --> 01:43:34,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, yeah, King of Fighters is sort of like an evolution of Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting and those games, and it's okay.

1286
01:43:34,993 --> 01:43:43,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's not something I really can usually tolerate long-term, though, the SNK games, but they do have that whole, like, you know, foreground and background thing, which is kind of what made them famous.

1287
01:43:44,075 --> 01:43:45,955
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just Fatal Fury.

1288
01:43:46,275 --> 01:43:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, oh, was it just Fatal Fury?

1289
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:49,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought King of Fighters had it, too.

1290
01:43:49,576 --> 01:43:49,876
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

1291
01:43:50,956 --> 01:43:51,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Art of Fighting have it?

1292
01:43:51,996 --> 01:43:52,816
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think just Fatal Fury.

1293
01:43:52,856 --> 01:43:54,777
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Art of Fighting had the weird zoom in and out thing.

1294
01:43:54,817 --> 01:43:55,457
[SPEAKER_06]: That was its little niche.

1295
01:43:55,477 --> 01:43:56,057
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Summer Showdown.

1296
01:43:57,006 --> 01:43:57,706
[SPEAKER_06]: R-Fighting did it too.

1297
01:43:57,786 --> 01:43:58,606
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one did at least.

1298
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:01,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it was Fatal Fury that had the background foreground.

1299
01:44:01,787 --> 01:44:03,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1300
01:44:04,067 --> 01:44:07,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different and worth a play, but I don't think it's necessarily better.

1301
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:09,069
[SPEAKER_06]: If that makes sense.

1302
01:44:09,549 --> 01:44:11,109
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love Capcom vs. SNK.

1303
01:44:11,129 --> 01:44:12,569
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of my favorite fighters right there.

1304
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:15,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Matt, what's your preference?

1305
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:15,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter or King of Fighting?

1306
01:44:16,870 --> 01:44:17,410
[SPEAKER_02]: King of Fighters.

1307
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:19,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a preference, Loki?

1308
01:44:20,111 --> 01:44:21,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Robin Street Fighter vs. King of Fighters?

1309
01:44:21,891 --> 01:44:22,071
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

1310
01:44:22,211 --> 01:44:22,731
[SPEAKER_05]: You hate them all?

1311
01:44:23,671 --> 01:44:25,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Not hate, but I just don't really care.

1312
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you this.

1313
01:44:28,021 --> 01:44:31,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of the King of Fighters games on Saturn have a bitch of a load time.

1314
01:44:32,605 --> 01:44:33,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1315
01:44:34,486 --> 01:44:35,547
[SPEAKER_02]: In between rounds.

1316
01:44:36,047 --> 01:44:38,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Load time.

1317
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:42,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So, next email.

1318
01:44:43,172 --> 01:44:53,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I was just wondering if it was possible for you guys to create a widget for Samsung phones for your podcast as I would love to be able to listen to you on the go and download your shows wherever I am.

1319
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Simmel.

1320
01:44:56,808 --> 01:44:59,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I've not even heard of the Samsung phones widget thing.

1321
01:44:59,971 --> 01:45:01,252
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not something I'm familiar with.

1322
01:45:01,272 --> 01:45:03,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Send us more information on how to make one.

1323
01:45:03,234 --> 01:45:06,277
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's just doing a simple website or something, I'm sure we can figure it out.

1324
01:45:06,677 --> 01:45:10,661
[SPEAKER_06]: If it involves programming like an iPhone application, well, I don't know so much about that.

1325
01:45:12,142 --> 01:45:27,787
[SPEAKER_06]: if it's something you can connect to iTunes I don't know if your phone I don't know because there's a lot of Samsung phones if your phone my old phone was a Samsung and if it has a memory card like my old one you can put your own songs or your own music on it basically you should be able to just sync it up with iTunes and download our podcast on iTunes and do it that way

1326
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,321
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best thing I can think of.

1327
01:45:30,341 --> 01:45:32,282
[SPEAKER_02]: With all its fails, we can look and see what that is.

1328
01:45:32,522 --> 01:45:35,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if it's easy enough, why not?

1329
01:45:36,024 --> 01:45:41,947
[SPEAKER_02]: We also got one... That last one and this one that I'm about to read is actually put in through the website.

1330
01:45:42,707 --> 01:45:42,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

1331
01:45:42,927 --> 01:45:43,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

1332
01:45:44,368 --> 01:45:47,430
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, the catchphrase thing you got here is fucking terrible.

1333
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:49,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1334
01:45:49,591 --> 01:45:52,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it wrong because it's really confusing and erased my whole goddamn message.

1335
01:45:53,393 --> 01:45:56,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think that's the fault of the program.

1336
01:45:58,315 --> 01:46:01,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I was just wondering why the show takes so long to go up now.

1337
01:46:01,156 --> 01:46:02,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to go up the day after recording.

1338
01:46:02,756 --> 01:46:03,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not take this as a complaint.

1339
01:46:04,017 --> 01:46:04,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I am just curious.

1340
01:46:04,877 --> 01:46:05,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1341
01:46:06,697 --> 01:46:17,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because my setup here changed, and I have two computers now that I have to go back and forth between, and then also this week I was on a work trip, so I try to do it as I can.

1342
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:22,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Other people are offering to help make the process go faster, so we'll hopefully get on that.

1343
01:46:22,962 --> 01:46:23,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1344
01:46:24,827 --> 01:46:25,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Last email.

1345
01:46:25,848 --> 01:46:30,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, you know what, I'm going to save this one for a last minute story, Rob.

1346
01:46:30,671 --> 01:46:30,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1347
01:46:31,091 --> 01:46:39,417
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am going to go ahead and credit the story to, well, they didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say, Nigel, thank you.

1348
01:46:40,337 --> 01:46:40,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1349
01:46:41,158 --> 01:46:43,319
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be one of our last minute stories.

1350
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:44,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Congrats.

1351
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:46,301
[SPEAKER_02]: You have contributed to the show.

1352
01:46:47,122 --> 01:46:47,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, level up.

1353
01:46:47,682 --> 01:46:48,362
[SPEAKER_02]: The winner is you.

1354
01:46:48,422 --> 01:46:49,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a no prize.

1355
01:46:50,115 --> 01:46:55,057
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send them to.

1356
01:46:55,517 --> 01:46:56,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get back into some gaming news.

1357
01:46:56,637 --> 01:46:56,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1358
01:46:57,378 --> 01:46:57,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1359
01:46:59,118 --> 01:47:07,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some really neat download content that's going to be coming out very soon for Fear 2 Project Origin.

1360
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:10,542
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the Toy Soldiers download content.

1361
01:47:11,122 --> 01:47:14,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it is is it's a few multiplayer maps that they're adding in.

1362
01:47:14,443 --> 01:47:15,964
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's kind of neat about it is...

1363
01:47:16,504 --> 01:47:22,386
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all done from the perspective that you're small little toy soldiers fighting in these giant areas.

1364
01:47:22,867 --> 01:47:30,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, some of the maps that they have, they have a hospital room that you'll actually fight around in.

1365
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:32,290
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a playground.

1366
01:47:32,891 --> 01:47:37,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, one that Jamie I think will like, they have one that you fight inside of a pinball machine.

1367
01:47:38,153 --> 01:47:38,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet!

1368
01:47:40,147 --> 01:47:41,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, very cool.

1369
01:47:41,929 --> 01:47:44,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a unique twist to the whole multiplayer stuff.

1370
01:47:45,552 --> 01:47:47,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad that they're actually having a little bit of fun with it.

1371
01:47:47,894 --> 01:47:49,575
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks pretty sweet.

1372
01:47:49,595 --> 01:47:51,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say that the pinball machine looks the best out of all of them.

1373
01:47:53,859 --> 01:47:56,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Now only if the giant metal ball is rolling around in there too.

1374
01:47:56,641 --> 01:47:57,122
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be cool.

1375
01:48:00,865 --> 01:48:04,488
[SPEAKER_05]: But no word on when exactly these will be available.

1376
01:48:04,948 --> 01:48:07,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I guess it'll be in April and it will be free.

1377
01:48:08,849 --> 01:48:09,870
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's awesome.

1378
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:12,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Free stuff is always welcome.

1379
01:48:13,633 --> 01:48:15,455
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best kind of download content is free.

1380
01:48:17,782 --> 01:48:20,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a new trademark has been filed this week.

1381
01:48:21,144 --> 01:48:23,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Sing Hero is the trademark.

1382
01:48:23,265 --> 01:48:30,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you know that was filed by Activision, Blizzard, the folks behind Guitar Hero and DJ Hero.

1383
01:48:30,568 --> 01:48:33,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently now Sing Hero has been patented.

1384
01:48:34,430 --> 01:48:34,990
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

1385
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:39,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this going to be their version of Sing Star or Karaoke Revolution?

1386
01:48:39,452 --> 01:48:41,513
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to milk the Hero franchise.

1387
01:48:44,704 --> 01:48:50,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I will say though, keep in mind this company also trademarked Drum Villain and I don't think that ever happened.

1388
01:48:51,629 --> 01:48:55,152
[SPEAKER_06]: So just because they trademarked it doesn't mean the game is actually going to happen.

1389
01:48:55,993 --> 01:49:04,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but they also could mean just because they trademarked Drum Villain, maybe they just rolled that into Guitar Hero World Tour.

1390
01:49:04,279 --> 01:49:07,922
[SPEAKER_05]: But singing's in Guitar Hero World Tour, so I'm not sure why they're going to have this whole separate game.

1391
01:49:07,942 --> 01:49:09,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe this is going to have more pop music.

1392
01:49:10,023 --> 01:49:10,504
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be.

1393
01:49:11,444 --> 01:49:11,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh boy.

1394
01:49:13,021 --> 01:49:33,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear stories like this, I can just hear the sounds of the Guitar Hero franchise being milked even more, and that's like after seeing the arcade game this week and everything, and it's just like, I'm starting to get pretty sick of all this stuff, and it just makes me angsty, because, you know, it used to be such a good game, but now it's just getting, like, beaten to dead horse.

1395
01:49:33,711 --> 01:49:35,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get angsty, and that's why the FUs of the Week happen.

1396
01:49:51,856 --> 01:50:03,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of FUs, but one of them is a very big, very major one, and it's directed towards my body for reasons that I choose not to disclose publicly at this time.

1397
01:50:04,602 --> 01:50:06,783
[SPEAKER_02]: But certain people know what I'm talking about.

1398
01:50:07,664 --> 01:50:12,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second one, it goes towards a lack of tact.

1399
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:14,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

1400
01:50:16,688 --> 01:50:16,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

1401
01:50:17,711 --> 01:50:20,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy to Burger King for burning my fries.

1402
01:50:20,914 --> 01:50:27,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never... Honestly, I'd expect this kind of thing from McDonald's because they fuck up their fries more times than not.

1403
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:29,682
[SPEAKER_05]: But Burger King, come on, man.

1404
01:50:29,722 --> 01:50:35,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Your fries are usually pretty tasteless and they're fixed by ketchup, but these fries were burnt.

1405
01:50:35,487 --> 01:50:36,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they were browned.

1406
01:50:37,153 --> 01:50:43,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and the other thing too, if you ask me if I want ketchup with my fries, don't just not give me ketchup.

1407
01:50:44,155 --> 01:50:47,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't ask me the question and just say, oh, here's no ketchup for you.

1408
01:50:48,516 --> 01:50:49,697
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd like some ketchup, wouldn't you?

1409
01:50:49,717 --> 01:50:50,637
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not giving you any.

1410
01:50:50,797 --> 01:50:51,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not giving you any.

1411
01:50:52,198 --> 01:50:57,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So F you to minimum wage Burger King workers.

1412
01:50:58,494 --> 01:51:16,221
[SPEAKER_06]: um well geez as GS68 in chat says poor poor Loki's fries um I don't really have anything that major this week I guess two FUs one FU goes to jet lag because that sucks and my sleep has been all screwed up like for the past four days because of it um I was in Washington DC this week by the way just for a few days

1413
01:51:17,181 --> 01:51:19,603
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were following me on Twitter, you probably saw some of that stuff.

1414
01:51:20,503 --> 01:51:26,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, my only other F you would go to the fact that we have no Dunkin' Donuts here in California, at least NorCal.

1415
01:51:27,187 --> 01:51:30,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's sad because I freaking love their coffee.

1416
01:51:30,949 --> 01:51:38,313
[SPEAKER_06]: But I actually brought back a Dunkin' Donut for my roommate on the plane from Texas because I always gush about...

1417
01:51:38,894 --> 01:51:42,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Dunkin' Donuts, even though the donuts are only okay.

1418
01:51:42,358 --> 01:51:44,060
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, I'm not as huge on the donuts.

1419
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:44,701
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the coffee.

1420
01:51:44,861 --> 01:51:45,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the coffee.

1421
01:51:45,803 --> 01:51:46,483
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not bad.

1422
01:51:46,503 --> 01:51:47,285
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not bad at all.

1423
01:51:53,214 --> 01:51:54,634
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's really it.

1424
01:51:54,995 --> 01:51:58,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are my not-so-serious FUs of the week, but that's what I've got.

1425
01:51:58,396 --> 01:52:00,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the jetlag one's actually pretty serious.

1426
01:52:00,696 --> 01:52:02,257
[SPEAKER_06]: That really was annoying.

1427
01:52:02,637 --> 01:52:04,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I did want to say, though, about a Sing Hero.

1428
01:52:04,598 --> 01:52:09,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to read some comments here in chat about that because I thought one of these in particular was pretty good.

1429
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:15,661
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru, I believe, said that they might just be trying to protect their trademark.

1430
01:52:15,681 --> 01:52:17,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just protecting trademarks.

1431
01:52:17,802 --> 01:52:18,482
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru GameGuru

1432
01:52:39,912 --> 01:52:40,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitstun says, F.U.

1433
01:52:40,933 --> 01:52:43,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky, you have arcades with Street Fighter 4 and we don't.

1434
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:43,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I do?

1435
01:52:44,795 --> 01:52:46,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I guess here in California, yeah.

1436
01:52:46,256 --> 01:52:47,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I just haven't driven to them.

1437
01:52:47,957 --> 01:52:48,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Not around us.

1438
01:52:48,817 --> 01:52:49,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not here in SAC.

1439
01:52:51,038 --> 01:52:52,880
[SPEAKER_06]: But we do have the Guitar Hero Arcade now.

1440
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:56,702
[SPEAKER_06]: They have Mario Kart 2, which I didn't check out, but they have that.

1441
01:52:57,402 --> 01:52:58,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that would be fun.

1442
01:52:58,243 --> 01:52:58,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh.

1443
01:52:58,323 --> 01:53:00,144
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get drunk and go play it.

1444
01:53:00,704 --> 01:53:02,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I don't know.

1445
01:53:02,825 --> 01:53:04,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really care for Mario Kart Arcade.

1446
01:53:05,327 --> 01:53:05,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of lame.

1447
01:53:06,748 --> 01:53:08,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, but maybe the sequel has fixed some things.

1448
01:53:08,709 --> 01:53:09,069
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

1449
01:53:09,654 --> 01:53:10,474
[SPEAKER_05]: No, doubt it.

1450
01:53:11,115 --> 01:53:12,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into another story.

1451
01:53:14,016 --> 01:53:15,337
[SPEAKER_05]: They need more F-Zero GX.

1452
01:53:17,118 --> 01:53:18,258
[SPEAKER_05]: They do need more F-Zero GX.

1453
01:53:18,738 --> 01:53:21,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is another interesting thing.

1454
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:23,761
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how all these LEGO games have been coming out?

1455
01:53:23,961 --> 01:53:25,061
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more!

1456
01:53:26,322 --> 01:53:28,103
[SPEAKER_02]: More, more, more!

1457
01:53:28,723 --> 01:53:31,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Which means people must be buying all the ones that are out there now.

1458
01:53:32,385 --> 01:53:33,165
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

1459
01:53:33,285 --> 01:53:36,007
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing it for a good reason, because they are pretty damn fun.

1460
01:53:37,068 --> 01:53:39,894
[SPEAKER_02]: But one's sort of a late franchise now.

1461
01:53:39,954 --> 01:53:41,358
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing a Harry Potter Lego.

1462
01:53:42,752 --> 01:53:43,552
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never too late.

1463
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:13,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not surprised at all.

1464
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:42,225
[SPEAKER_05]: But basing your game, I would have to guess it would probably be the original game plus the new stuff as well.

1465
01:54:42,425 --> 01:54:43,046
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

1466
01:54:44,107 --> 01:54:45,187
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of fun.

1467
01:54:45,247 --> 01:54:46,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I understand why they're coming out.

1468
01:54:46,788 --> 01:54:49,750
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like one of these games that I look at and go, WTF, why are we getting this?

1469
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:51,231
[SPEAKER_06]: But I get this.

1470
01:54:51,892 --> 01:54:53,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's not really a surprise at all.

1471
01:54:53,113 --> 01:54:57,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've been speculating, Loki, for quite some time that the Harry Potter game is going to be the next Lego thing.

1472
01:54:57,796 --> 01:54:58,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1473
01:54:58,456 --> 01:54:59,477
[SPEAKER_06]: This is no surprise.

1474
01:54:59,597 --> 01:55:02,658
[SPEAKER_05]: If they've got a toy for it, they're going to make a game for it.

1475
01:55:02,758 --> 01:55:10,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you see all of a sudden LEGO Halo toys coming out, then you better believe that there's going to be a LEGO Halo game at some point.

1476
01:55:10,119 --> 01:55:11,580
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, it's an April Fool's joke.

1477
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, otherwise it's an April Fool's joke.

1478
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:14,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

1479
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:26,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be surprised if we see another LEGO Batman game, because that's something that they can keep adding to and basically have unlimited content for, because they're not based off movies.

1480
01:55:26,283 --> 01:55:26,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1481
01:55:27,759 --> 01:55:29,440
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a problem, basing stuff off movies.

1482
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:31,940
[SPEAKER_06]: When they don't make any more movies, you have no more games.

1483
01:55:32,761 --> 01:55:34,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Another comment from GameGuru in chat.

1484
01:55:34,561 --> 01:55:37,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, Lego Prince of Persia will likely be next when the toys come out.

1485
01:55:38,523 --> 01:55:39,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it, though?

1486
01:55:40,603 --> 01:55:42,884
[SPEAKER_06]: They rebooted the Prince of Persia franchise recently.

1487
01:55:42,944 --> 01:55:44,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Won't they make the sequel in that kind of...

1488
01:55:46,471 --> 01:55:47,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1489
01:56:02,401 --> 01:56:02,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1490
01:56:03,141 --> 01:56:09,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if they do, if the movie comes out and it's really popular and stuff and everyone's interested in it, I don't know if they're really going to do it.

1491
01:56:10,284 --> 01:56:12,765
[SPEAKER_05]: It would all depend on how many toys come out and how well the toys do.

1492
01:56:13,965 --> 01:56:15,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Rice Princess in chat says, I love Lego games.

1493
01:56:16,006 --> 01:56:17,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Harry Potter games.

1494
01:56:17,207 --> 01:56:19,227
[SPEAKER_06]: The two combined would make my head explode.

1495
01:56:22,709 --> 01:56:23,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1496
01:56:23,129 --> 01:56:26,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Giovedea says, Lego doesn't sell the HP sets anymore.

1497
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:29,331
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't even get the sets off Lego.com.

1498
01:56:29,671 --> 01:56:30,252
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1499
01:56:30,452 --> 01:56:30,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1500
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:32,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1501
01:56:33,031 --> 01:56:35,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Tatsuya says, still waiting on Lego Watchmen.

1502
01:56:36,495 --> 01:56:37,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think so.

1503
01:56:37,776 --> 01:56:38,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that one.

1504
01:56:39,678 --> 01:56:41,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it come complete with a detachable penis?

1505
01:56:42,861 --> 01:56:43,622
[SPEAKER_06]: For Dr. Manhattan.

1506
01:56:43,642 --> 01:56:45,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Special soundtrack by King Missile.

1507
01:56:45,664 --> 01:56:51,030
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he'll have his little, like, you know, molecular underpants.

1508
01:56:51,290 --> 01:56:53,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I did not understand because, you know...

1509
01:56:55,986 --> 01:56:58,347
[SPEAKER_05]: He could wear underpants, yet he didn't.

1510
01:56:58,407 --> 01:56:59,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And he doesn't really exist.

1511
01:56:59,748 --> 01:57:00,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw the movie.

1512
01:57:00,849 --> 01:57:08,813
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point was that he's detached from humanity and humanity's standards, so it doesn't matter to him if he's dressed or not.

1513
01:57:08,833 --> 01:57:10,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I mean, seriously, if you think about it...

1514
01:57:11,534 --> 01:57:13,315
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the Viet Cong going to be really scared of?

1515
01:57:13,435 --> 01:57:16,176
[SPEAKER_05]: A giant glowing blue penis is coming towards them.

1516
01:57:16,216 --> 01:57:19,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so down with Dr. Manhattan.

1517
01:57:20,378 --> 01:57:21,559
[SPEAKER_02]: He's wearing his black pants.

1518
01:57:21,819 --> 01:57:23,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

1519
01:57:23,139 --> 01:57:24,980
[SPEAKER_06]: He should have just been buck wild there.

1520
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to do the show naked from now on.

1521
01:57:27,281 --> 01:57:28,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with what Dr. Manhattan said.

1522
01:57:28,282 --> 01:57:29,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, it doesn't matter.

1523
01:57:29,582 --> 01:57:31,823
[SPEAKER_05]: No amount of blue penis makes that movie any good.

1524
01:57:32,143 --> 01:57:33,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well.

1525
01:57:34,733 --> 01:57:35,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad Trombone

1526
01:57:59,525 --> 01:58:00,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I should do just as well.

1527
01:58:00,966 --> 01:58:02,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Since it's going to be Infinity Ward again.

1528
01:58:02,968 --> 01:58:04,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Because everyone knows that Treyarch sucks.

1529
01:58:07,493 --> 01:58:09,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people who play Call of Duty 4.

1530
01:58:09,154 --> 01:58:10,636
[SPEAKER_06]: This number doesn't surprise me one bit.

1531
01:58:11,236 --> 01:58:11,316
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1532
01:58:14,949 --> 01:58:15,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Danny Harrison, son of George Harrison

1533
01:58:31,348 --> 01:58:31,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1534
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:59,405
[SPEAKER_06]: So as if this game wasn't going to sell to the Beatle collectors already, imagine if this game has never before heard Beatle stuff.

1535
01:58:59,745 --> 01:59:03,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't believe that anything like that still exists, to be honest.

1536
01:59:03,608 --> 01:59:05,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But there you go.

1537
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:12,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, by the way, Donnie, who's the son of, of course, George Harrison, he's been a big part of actually trying to get the Beatles rock band to happen.

1538
01:59:13,216 --> 01:59:15,918
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in a band of his own who has an album coming out this month.

1539
01:59:16,439 --> 01:59:16,780
[SPEAKER_06]: AppleCore

1540
01:59:25,683 --> 01:59:27,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And convinced everyone to sort of have a presentation.

1541
01:59:28,445 --> 01:59:31,727
[SPEAKER_06]: The game has been in the making for two years.

1542
01:59:32,228 --> 01:59:39,073
[SPEAKER_06]: They say it's historically accurate, a real headache, but it's the most enjoyable work that he's been a part of, apparently.

1543
01:59:39,793 --> 01:59:41,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like it could be interesting.

1544
01:59:41,915 --> 01:59:42,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be.

1545
01:59:43,196 --> 01:59:44,717
[SPEAKER_06]: 9909 is when this game's coming out.

1546
01:59:44,757 --> 01:59:46,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty hard to forget that release date.

1547
01:59:48,019 --> 01:59:50,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, all we have to do is remember Dreamcast.

1548
01:59:50,841 --> 01:59:51,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Or that.

1549
01:59:51,802 --> 01:59:51,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1550
01:59:52,984 --> 01:59:58,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to mention in the gaming week, we actually did bust out the Dreamcast and go through some Sonic Adventure.

1551
01:59:58,346 --> 01:59:58,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1552
01:59:59,387 --> 02:00:01,887
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our VMUs still work.

1553
02:00:02,328 --> 02:00:02,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

1554
02:00:03,068 --> 02:00:04,609
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all of our Samba files too.

1555
02:00:06,549 --> 02:00:07,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some other news.

1556
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:10,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Wallace and Gromit is still out there.

1557
02:00:13,012 --> 02:00:17,254
[SPEAKER_02]: There is actually a game coming out on March 24th with a demo on the 16th.

1558
02:00:19,074 --> 02:00:20,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Telltale Games is putting this out.

1559
02:00:22,236 --> 02:00:27,938
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's part of, as far as I'm aware, the episodic Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures.

1560
02:00:28,838 --> 02:00:31,439
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hey, keep your eyes open for it.

1561
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:37,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also going to be another Strong Bad game.

1562
02:00:40,016 --> 02:00:46,543
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pre-order Wallace and Gromit, you'll get a full episode of actually Sam and Max and Strong Bad.

1563
02:00:47,384 --> 02:00:47,925
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1564
02:00:49,787 --> 02:00:50,428
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

1565
02:00:50,728 --> 02:00:50,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1566
02:00:51,709 --> 02:00:52,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice little bonus there.

1567
02:00:53,451 --> 02:00:55,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I like full games as bonuses.

1568
02:00:55,574 --> 02:00:56,194
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good deal.

1569
02:00:57,195 --> 02:00:57,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

1570
02:00:59,085 --> 02:01:09,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is kind of not new to the MMO scene, but Final Fantasy XI has finally jumped on board, much like the Blizzard Authenticator.

1571
02:01:10,152 --> 02:01:18,098
[SPEAKER_05]: They now have something very similar to that that will generate random passcodes every few minutes, I guess.

1572
02:01:20,019 --> 02:01:22,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Final Fantasy XI security token.

1573
02:01:23,301 --> 02:01:28,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, the constantly changing login passwords will apparently protect your account from hackers.

1574
02:01:30,386 --> 02:01:49,918
[SPEAKER_05]: and the only thing though is they haven't released a price for it yet but it will come with some in-game exclusive items when you purchase this token huh okay so you get special stuff in the actual game?

1575
02:01:50,539 --> 02:01:56,523
[SPEAKER_06]: yes, you get like stuff in the game I'm still not interested in going back, sorry alright

1576
02:01:57,829 --> 02:02:10,520
[SPEAKER_05]: One more story for you guys, then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio Oh, I was going to, real quickly, I was going to mention the Vanadio Collection Yeah, $14.99 now Oh my gosh, on Xbox 360?

1577
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:24,191
[SPEAKER_06]: And Windows Wow, they're really trying to get new crack addicts on that game Because, you know, you pay that once They might as well just give the game away Because you get 30 days for free with that And $14.99 is how much it costs a month, right?

1578
02:02:24,211 --> 02:02:24,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah

1579
02:02:26,174 --> 02:02:28,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised they haven't gone the route of just doing a downloadable demo, or have they?

1580
02:02:28,976 --> 02:02:29,717
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just missed that.

1581
02:02:29,937 --> 02:02:30,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1582
02:02:30,257 --> 02:02:31,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they did, and I might have missed that.

1583
02:02:32,018 --> 02:02:32,238
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1584
02:02:32,758 --> 02:02:33,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, one more story for you guys.

1585
02:02:33,739 --> 02:02:37,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely different side note here, but something also to kind of take a note.

1586
02:02:37,461 --> 02:02:37,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

1587
02:02:38,862 --> 02:02:43,545
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy from a Yale University, he's a Yale University student, so you know he's smart.

1588
02:02:43,865 --> 02:02:45,446
[SPEAKER_06]: His name is Jesse Myman.

1589
02:02:45,686 --> 02:02:46,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it's connected.

1590
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:47,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, could be.

1591
02:02:48,509 --> 02:02:53,395
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a report in the Cincinnati Inquirer that Jesse's a little pissed off because he flew U.S.

1592
02:02:53,455 --> 02:02:59,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Airways and he was flying them in December from Connecticut to Ohio and they basically lost his Xbox 360.

1593
02:03:01,249 --> 02:03:08,292
[SPEAKER_06]: He went to pick up his luggage after he landed and he noticed that everything was there except for the Xbox 360 and all the accompanying components.

1594
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:11,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm assuming he believes that it was theft.

1595
02:03:12,795 --> 02:03:17,297
[SPEAKER_06]: His suit says after that that he got weeks of an unconcessionable runaround.

1596
02:03:17,857 --> 02:03:19,318
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what happened next, right?

1597
02:03:20,322 --> 02:03:22,204
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1598
02:03:41,647 --> 02:03:43,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why you're using the Xbox 360.

1599
02:03:43,288 --> 02:03:44,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess I can see that.

1600
02:03:44,328 --> 02:03:46,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Upscale on the HD, right?

1601
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:47,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1602
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:48,290
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, here's the thing.

1603
02:03:48,891 --> 02:03:54,694
[SPEAKER_06]: He wants the airline to pay him $1,700 for the loss of the gaming system because apparently he probably had his own additions on it.

1604
02:03:54,734 --> 02:03:55,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1605
02:03:55,935 --> 02:03:58,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And for non-economic distress of at least $25,000.

1606
02:04:00,457 --> 02:04:02,658
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's seeking the maximum, $1 million.

1607
02:04:03,559 --> 02:04:04,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

1608
02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:05,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly how that works.

1609
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:06,340
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing.

1610
02:04:07,361 --> 02:04:09,882
[SPEAKER_06]: US Air would like to point out their policy state...

1611
02:04:11,386 --> 02:04:20,752
[SPEAKER_06]: The federal loss limits are capped out at $3,300 per bag, and the airline's luggage policy excludes liability for electronics.

1612
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:22,511
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1613
02:04:42,839 --> 02:04:45,701
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when the bag gets to wherever, they should have scaled it again.

1614
02:04:46,001 --> 02:04:49,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a clear difference in weight in the bag.

1615
02:04:49,062 --> 02:04:52,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those Xbox 360s weigh like 15 pounds, you know.

1616
02:04:53,785 --> 02:04:55,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, they stole it.

1617
02:04:55,246 --> 02:05:02,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's no way that it didn't break during the flight, which I don't see really being the airline's fault.

1618
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:07,032
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt says I always bring my console on the plane with me or not at all

1619
02:05:23,462 --> 02:05:30,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Deekman says if it was broken, yes, but it was stolen.

1620
02:05:31,044 --> 02:05:34,744
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ask for a million, though, suddenly a settlement of $500,000 is looking pretty good.

1621
02:05:35,165 --> 02:05:37,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe this guy's just trying to highball it.

1622
02:05:37,065 --> 02:05:37,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1623
02:05:37,725 --> 02:05:38,625
[SPEAKER_06]: He is trying to highball it.

1624
02:05:39,065 --> 02:05:42,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Gripper01 says God help Microsoft if it ever red rings.

1625
02:05:45,147 --> 02:05:45,747
[SPEAKER_06]: What a good point.

1626
02:05:46,966 --> 02:06:08,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So, alright If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio We're going to open up the Skype line Take a couple of calls Probably not too many tonight Because we are running a little long tonight But we also want to get to last minute stories here In just a little bit And all that fun stuff So go ahead and give us a call now We do have a call, we'll go to that Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1627
02:06:10,751 --> 02:06:13,031
[SPEAKER_06]: It's GS68 Hey, GS68, what's on your mind?

1628
02:06:14,271 --> 02:06:16,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on Okay, I'll wait

1629
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:20,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I got Gradius Rebirth this week.

1630
02:06:20,722 --> 02:06:21,382
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1631
02:06:22,863 --> 02:06:24,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I got Gradius Rebirth this week.

1632
02:06:24,404 --> 02:06:26,306
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out this Monday, much to my surprise.

1633
02:06:28,308 --> 02:06:29,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Gradius 3.

1634
02:06:29,889 --> 02:06:32,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us, or wait, Gradius Rebirth or Gradius 3?

1635
02:06:32,471 --> 02:06:34,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Rebirth.

1636
02:06:35,293 --> 02:06:37,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little bit about Gradius Rebirth.

1637
02:06:37,655 --> 02:06:38,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put you on with Loki here.

1638
02:06:38,916 --> 02:06:40,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to take care of something in the studio.

1639
02:06:41,258 --> 02:06:41,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright then.

1640
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:47,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us about the game.

1641
02:06:47,402 --> 02:06:47,983
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of it?

1642
02:06:49,366 --> 02:06:59,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, basically it's a new Drydance title, and it looks more like a 16-bit or 32-bit Drydance game, kind of like Drydance 3, or a bit like Drydance Gaiden.

1643
02:07:00,170 --> 02:07:07,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's basically a remix, it's more or less a remix of older Drydance games rather than a completely new title.

1644
02:07:07,893 --> 02:07:17,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm watching a replay of my soft right now, and my replay's on stage 2, which looks like a level from the MSX and MSS games.

1645
02:07:21,405 --> 02:07:21,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1646
02:07:22,766 --> 02:07:23,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds pretty cool.

1647
02:07:24,047 --> 02:07:27,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's only five stages, though.

1648
02:07:28,911 --> 02:07:35,855
[SPEAKER_08]: For 1,000 weak points, that might turn off a few players, but as a driving fan, I just had to get this game.

1649
02:07:37,136 --> 02:07:47,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of my favorite things is on stage one, there are two enemies, and if you destroy either one first, you can change the entire stage depending on which enemy.

1650
02:07:47,964 --> 02:07:48,324
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sort of like

1651
02:07:49,201 --> 02:07:56,126
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't destroy either, the stage continues as normal, but if you destroy the top enemy, the stage becomes frozen.

1652
02:07:56,286 --> 02:08:00,670
[SPEAKER_08]: If you destroy the bottom enemy, all the weapons in the stage become active and the stage gets harder.

1653
02:08:01,991 --> 02:08:02,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1654
02:08:02,931 --> 02:08:03,512
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of neat.

1655
02:08:03,932 --> 02:08:04,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1656
02:08:06,474 --> 02:08:15,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, um, looking at the weapon arrangement for the game, you have the usual, like, regular missile and double and laser.

1657
02:08:16,362 --> 02:08:16,802
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have...

1658
02:08:17,972 --> 02:08:26,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Another one where you have a bomb attack and then a twin laser that's weaker than the... It's not as powerful as the regular laser, but it shoots faster.

1659
02:08:27,105 --> 02:08:34,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's two unlockable setups that are more or less for more challenging players, I guess.

1660
02:08:38,217 --> 02:08:38,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it sounds pretty cool.

1661
02:08:39,057 --> 02:08:40,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually kind of thinking of checking this out.

1662
02:08:41,678 --> 02:08:43,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I just haven't gotten a chance to download it yet.

1663
02:08:44,198 --> 02:08:50,840
[SPEAKER_05]: That and that new one that's coming out on Monday here, BitTrip, or was it BitTrip Beat or whatever.

1664
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,020
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks pretty awesome.

1665
02:08:52,760 --> 02:09:05,183
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully, you know, I know they've been probably a little bit inspired by the Mega Man 9 stuff, so hopefully we see more of these retro remakes that aren't exactly, you know, retro, I guess.

1666
02:09:05,203 --> 02:09:05,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1667
02:09:07,253 --> 02:09:08,233
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of cool.

1668
02:09:08,253 --> 02:09:08,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1669
02:09:08,373 --> 02:09:09,294
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I always... Hmm.

1670
02:09:32,768 --> 02:09:34,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they bring some of this stuff out.

1671
02:09:35,029 --> 02:09:39,371
[SPEAKER_05]: They should do a Gradius collection on DS or something.

1672
02:09:39,391 --> 02:09:42,893
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a Gradius collection on PSP in Japan.

1673
02:09:43,093 --> 02:09:44,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but they have it here too.

1674
02:09:44,773 --> 02:09:46,214
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a Proteus collection.

1675
02:09:47,555 --> 02:09:48,955
[SPEAKER_05]: But they need it on DS as well.

1676
02:09:49,976 --> 02:09:55,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to sell them at a collection, but the fact that my old PSP has a crappy D-pad is turning me off from it.

1677
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:01,601
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want to get a new PSP because then I'll

1678
02:10:02,625 --> 02:10:06,726
[SPEAKER_08]: because then I have to restart my DJ Max save files because they're locked to the current PSP.

1679
02:10:12,007 --> 02:10:12,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, cool.

1680
02:10:13,207 --> 02:10:15,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any other WiiWare games you're looking forward to checking out?

1681
02:10:18,668 --> 02:10:20,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't think so.

1682
02:10:20,429 --> 02:10:22,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few favorites that I want to buy eventually.

1683
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:25,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few older games that I eventually want to buy.

1684
02:10:25,810 --> 02:10:25,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

1685
02:10:31,997 --> 02:10:33,458
[SPEAKER_01]: So, crisis averted?

1686
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:36,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

1687
02:10:36,761 --> 02:10:40,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, we have Rob trying to find his microphone.

1688
02:10:40,624 --> 02:10:41,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we're back to normal, sorry.

1689
02:10:42,085 --> 02:10:48,090
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm sorry I missed the review, but let me just quickly ask for a summary.

1690
02:10:48,130 --> 02:10:49,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it worth breaking my boycott over?

1691
02:10:51,813 --> 02:10:52,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1692
02:10:53,014 --> 02:10:59,940
[SPEAKER_08]: It's certainly not the best... Well, it depends on what game is enough to make you break your boycott.

1693
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:00,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

1694
02:11:02,698 --> 02:11:05,679
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more of a game for hardcore Guardians fans like V.I.N.

1695
02:11:06,379 --> 02:11:10,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people forget the fact that it's only five stages and it doesn't really add much to the series.

1696
02:11:10,981 --> 02:11:15,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to wipe Defender Castle to get this game.

1697
02:11:34,124 --> 02:11:34,544
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1698
02:11:34,744 --> 02:11:35,105
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1699
02:11:35,165 --> 02:11:36,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I do love Defend Your Castle, though.

1700
02:11:36,426 --> 02:11:39,107
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for the review.

1701
02:11:39,127 --> 02:11:40,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I wasn't here to hear it all.

1702
02:11:40,628 --> 02:11:40,889
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1703
02:11:41,489 --> 02:11:41,949
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.

1704
02:11:42,169 --> 02:11:42,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1705
02:11:42,750 --> 02:11:43,170
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, see ya.

1706
02:11:44,791 --> 02:11:52,756
[SPEAKER_06]: We had like an insect outbreak here in studio because a piece of my sandwich fell on the ground, so all the ants rose up from the ground and were like, rise from the grave.

1707
02:11:52,896 --> 02:11:54,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Rise from your grave.

1708
02:11:54,478 --> 02:11:57,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they all decided to, yeah, have a piece of that.

1709
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:59,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was cute how you took care of it.

1710
02:11:59,878 --> 02:12:01,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I took care of it right away, right?

1711
02:12:01,559 --> 02:12:03,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's take a couple more calls here tonight.

1712
02:12:03,661 --> 02:12:04,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1713
02:12:04,681 --> 02:12:05,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1714
02:12:05,842 --> 02:12:06,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that was pretty quick.

1715
02:12:06,723 --> 02:12:07,483
[SPEAKER_06]: It's me, Ranma.

1716
02:12:07,624 --> 02:12:08,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Ranma.

1717
02:12:08,584 --> 02:12:10,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up everyone?

1718
02:12:10,546 --> 02:12:11,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much.

1719
02:12:11,326 --> 02:12:12,287
[SPEAKER_06]: We're ant-free now.

1720
02:12:12,327 --> 02:12:12,667
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

1721
02:12:13,788 --> 02:12:19,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want you guys to know that I took one for the team two weeks ago, and I want some type of compensation for it.

1722
02:12:19,492 --> 02:12:20,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh dear, what's this about?

1723
02:12:20,833 --> 02:12:22,154
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have compensation.

1724
02:12:22,254 --> 02:12:24,596
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't get compensated, so this has got to be good.

1725
02:12:25,859 --> 02:12:30,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually sat there and watched Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li

1726
02:12:51,994 --> 02:12:58,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they made the movie a little bit too realistic, and I don't care if I give spoilers or not, because that's how bad this movie was.

1727
02:13:00,219 --> 02:13:05,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, Bison should not be walking around in a mustache and a goatee.

1728
02:13:06,924 --> 02:13:07,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1729
02:13:08,104 --> 02:13:15,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, Vega's mask should not look like a cross between Vader and Shy Guy.

1730
02:13:17,010 --> 02:13:17,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

1731
02:13:18,411 --> 02:13:19,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three,

1732
02:13:20,402 --> 02:13:28,669
[SPEAKER_04]: In the fight sequence in the club, Chun-Li could have at least had on some type of blue dress or something to signify her traditional outfit, you know?

1733
02:13:28,969 --> 02:13:35,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And how the hell does she have injuries on her when you didn't look like she had any in the movie when she was fighting?

1734
02:13:38,196 --> 02:13:38,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1735
02:13:40,178 --> 02:13:41,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Not for nothing, I'll say this.

1736
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:46,183
[SPEAKER_04]: After seeing this movie, the original Street Fighter is ten times better...

1737
02:13:46,963 --> 02:13:51,025
[SPEAKER_04]: and I am so looking forward to Dragon Ball Evolution after this.

1738
02:13:55,467 --> 02:14:00,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it doesn't look, well, Dragon Ball Evolution doesn't look as bad.

1739
02:14:01,970 --> 02:14:05,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much, I'm just saying, I think after seeing this, that's gonna be a lot better.

1740
02:14:07,432 --> 02:14:09,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it's a shoo-in to win all the Razzie Awards next year?

1741
02:14:09,433 --> 02:14:10,413
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think it's that bad.

1742
02:14:10,453 --> 02:14:10,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if U.A.

1743
02:14:10,654 --> 02:14:12,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Boyle had anything to do with it, by default, it would.

1744
02:14:12,374 --> 02:14:12,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1745
02:14:12,494 --> 02:14:12,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think U.A.

1746
02:14:12,995 --> 02:14:13,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Boyle makes better movies than this?

1747
02:14:37,151 --> 02:15:00,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I can make better movies than this and I have an amateur digital camcorder I got from Joe Dea that I'm borrowing well congratulations there are my sister who is a who's graduating from Hofstra has a degree in filming she can do something better than this I've seen her do better work than this you know

1748
02:15:03,695 --> 02:15:12,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, every actor, every director usually has a stinker somewhere in their career, so what can you do?

1749
02:15:14,377 --> 02:15:20,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know, and it does help the fact that my roommate's a big Chun-Li fan, and I warned him, so, yeah.

1750
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:25,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, we all told you it would suck, and I have yet to hear anybody say it's good.

1751
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to hear a good review on this movie.

1752
02:15:28,220 --> 02:15:29,761
[SPEAKER_06]: You're asking for a little too much there.

1753
02:15:32,571 --> 02:15:32,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is.

1754
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:35,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody just linked Rotten Tomatoes there in chat.

1755
02:15:35,112 --> 02:15:38,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to look at this and see if it still has a 0% from all the critics out there.

1756
02:15:39,755 --> 02:15:41,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to see your stupid ad.

1757
02:15:41,355 --> 02:15:41,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1758
02:15:44,057 --> 02:15:45,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm skipping the ad right now.

1759
02:15:45,457 --> 02:15:47,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm trying to skip it too, but it's so freaking slow.

1760
02:15:48,779 --> 02:15:49,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1761
02:15:51,580 --> 02:15:49,079
4%.

1762
02:15:52,581 --> 02:15:54,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody gave it a positive review.

1763
02:15:55,379 --> 02:16:15,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is from Variety, of course it's Variety Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from video games, Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to oogle besides the titular heroine Huh Well, there you go A whopping 4% on Rotten Tomatoes Well, Ranma, nobody forced you to watch it, I don't know what to tell you

1764
02:16:16,354 --> 02:16:17,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I was bored.

1765
02:16:17,174 --> 02:16:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I tell you?

1766
02:16:17,774 --> 02:16:18,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't get any alcohol.

1767
02:16:19,275 --> 02:16:21,775
[SPEAKER_06]: No compensation for Morris Launch Radio.

1768
02:16:21,895 --> 02:16:22,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1769
02:16:22,615 --> 02:16:26,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Our compensation is go watch Silent Hill again and see a good game movie.

1770
02:16:27,836 --> 02:16:28,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1771
02:16:29,437 --> 02:16:31,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the original Mortal Kombat if you ask me.

1772
02:16:31,697 --> 02:16:33,738
[SPEAKER_02]: The first Mortal Kombat was fantastic.

1773
02:16:33,758 --> 02:16:34,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not bad.

1774
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:34,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it was.

1775
02:16:35,258 --> 02:16:40,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I would even say it was really close to theme.

1776
02:16:41,059 --> 02:16:44,860
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one is Life I Wish I Had Back.

1777
02:16:46,263 --> 02:16:47,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the third one comes out someday.

1778
02:16:49,386 --> 02:16:51,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

1779
02:16:51,989 --> 02:16:52,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy, okay?

1780
02:16:53,070 --> 02:16:53,410
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

1781
02:16:53,450 --> 02:16:54,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, later everyone.

1782
02:16:55,192 --> 02:16:56,793
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try to do at least one more call here.

1783
02:16:56,813 --> 02:16:58,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any last minute stories?

1784
02:16:58,555 --> 02:16:59,536
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I know you had one.

1785
02:17:02,359 --> 02:17:03,019
[SPEAKER_06]: You alright over there?

1786
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:06,923
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's going to hopefully give us a last minute story here.

1787
02:17:08,124 --> 02:17:10,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm glad the microphone didn't catch that.

1788
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:11,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is Ray.

1789
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:12,721
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually my first time calling.

1790
02:17:12,741 --> 02:17:14,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been listening to this show for four years now, I guess.

1791
02:17:15,042 --> 02:17:15,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Four years now.

1792
02:17:15,422 --> 02:17:15,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I've missed once.

1793
02:17:15,822 --> 02:17:16,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Ray.

1794
02:17:16,863 --> 02:17:17,003
[SPEAKER_06]: R-A-Y?

1795
02:17:17,703 --> 02:17:17,943
[SPEAKER_09]: R-A-Y?

1796
02:17:17,963 --> 02:17:20,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's my real name, heaven forbid.

1797
02:17:20,304 --> 02:17:20,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1798
02:17:20,544 --> 02:17:21,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what is up, Ray?

1799
02:17:40,172 --> 02:17:41,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, nothing really.

1800
02:17:41,332 --> 02:17:43,033
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 11 o'clock on spring break.

1801
02:17:43,073 --> 02:17:47,594
[SPEAKER_09]: All my friends are away, so I have nothing to do but stay up until 11 o'clock and listen to this show.

1802
02:17:47,614 --> 02:17:48,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

1803
02:17:48,634 --> 02:17:49,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I've missed a week.

1804
02:17:49,954 --> 02:17:50,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you very much.

1805
02:17:50,954 --> 02:17:52,835
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate you listening to the show.

1806
02:17:53,035 --> 02:17:55,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear something on tonight's show that you wanted to comment on?

1807
02:17:55,295 --> 02:17:55,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of the stories?

1808
02:17:56,955 --> 02:17:57,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, actually.

1809
02:17:58,356 --> 02:17:59,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Indie games, pretty much.

1810
02:18:00,916 --> 02:18:07,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember any specifics, because I was just thinking of something to call about, so I'm not just here babbling like an idiot on the internet, but Cave Story.

1811
02:18:08,018 --> 02:18:08,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anyone played it?

1812
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:09,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure Loki might have

1813
02:18:11,281 --> 02:18:13,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no, tell us a little more about this game.

1814
02:18:13,623 --> 02:18:14,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I've heard of this.

1815
02:18:15,885 --> 02:18:16,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, Cave Story.

1816
02:18:16,685 --> 02:18:18,607
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't heard of Cave Story?

1817
02:18:19,347 --> 02:18:19,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-mm.

1818
02:18:20,148 --> 02:18:20,989
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a PC title.

1819
02:18:21,069 --> 02:18:21,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.

1820
02:18:22,050 --> 02:18:23,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I guess Loki knows it.

1821
02:18:23,651 --> 02:18:24,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1822
02:18:24,872 --> 02:18:38,182
[SPEAKER_09]: It is coming to the Wii, that's why I brought it up, because it's getting a graphical redesign, but on the PC, it's free, it's translated from Japanese, and it's kind of a, I want to say classic-style shooter, sort of like Mega Man, but

1823
02:18:39,231 --> 02:18:41,574
[SPEAKER_09]: No wait, I'm lying, no, it's a little easier.

1824
02:18:42,114 --> 02:18:44,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I beat it, and I'm not that good at Mega Man games.

1825
02:18:45,838 --> 02:18:50,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I'd notice that Google Cave Story or English Translation should come up in one of the first few topics.

1826
02:18:51,755 --> 02:19:01,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, our chat room sure seems to know this game, and I'm actually trying to look up a little bit online to see if I know anything about this, and sadly, no, I don't know how I missed this.

1827
02:19:01,262 --> 02:19:02,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I just, I'm not cool.

1828
02:19:02,483 --> 02:19:04,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about Cave Story before.

1829
02:19:04,244 --> 02:19:04,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you?

1830
02:19:04,724 --> 02:19:05,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a couple times.

1831
02:19:05,725 --> 02:19:06,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about a lot of games on the show.

1832
02:19:06,786 --> 02:19:08,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care for it, but it's neat.

1833
02:19:08,547 --> 02:19:10,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they're making a version on PSP as well, it looks like?

1834
02:19:11,309 --> 02:19:11,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Homebrew.

1835
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:13,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's a homebrew project.

1836
02:19:14,211 --> 02:19:14,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1837
02:19:15,592 --> 02:19:16,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh, interesting, though.

1838
02:19:16,953 --> 02:19:17,774
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you find this game?

1839
02:19:17,814 --> 02:19:18,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.

1840
02:19:19,772 --> 02:19:26,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking through a list of homebrew PSP games and I found it there and I learned more about it and had a PC version which is really good.

1841
02:19:27,294 --> 02:19:27,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Really good.

1842
02:19:28,194 --> 02:19:30,614
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the same game almost but it looks bigger, better.

1843
02:19:31,555 --> 02:19:38,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why... Is it just me or does this game look very old school 8-bit NES style graphics?

1844
02:19:39,676 --> 02:19:40,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Precisely.

1845
02:19:41,577 --> 02:19:46,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thing I wanted to mention was Team Fortress 2 had an 8-bit demake

1846
02:19:48,255 --> 02:19:49,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Gang Garrison 2.

1847
02:19:51,376 --> 02:19:52,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not seen this.

1848
02:19:53,357 --> 02:19:57,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's a side-scrolling isometric shooter, but it's team-based online.

1849
02:19:57,418 --> 02:20:01,380
[SPEAKER_09]: It's anywhere from 10 players at a time to 100 players at a time.

1850
02:20:02,860 --> 02:20:04,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you can play as all nine major classes.

1851
02:20:05,901 --> 02:20:11,343
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of simplified, but there's still techniques to it, like the Pyro has the puffer instead of the backburner.

1852
02:20:11,383 --> 02:20:12,964
[SPEAKER_09]: There's none of the special extra weapons.

1853
02:20:13,484 --> 02:20:16,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can deflect rockets back, and 50-on-50 matches are crazy.

1854
02:20:17,751 --> 02:20:20,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been installed on the computer lab at my school.

1855
02:20:20,495 --> 02:20:21,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty neat.

1856
02:20:21,616 --> 02:20:22,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they let you do that?

1857
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:28,625
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a kind of lax administrator and we put it on thumb drives anyway, so it's alright.

1858
02:20:28,665 --> 02:20:29,526
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only 5 megs.

1859
02:20:30,247 --> 02:20:30,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

1860
02:20:31,024 --> 02:20:31,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, alright.

1861
02:20:33,065 --> 02:20:33,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my question.

1862
02:20:33,846 --> 02:20:39,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed you mentioned this game as a demake and we've talked about, I know last week's show we were talking about like a Final Fantasy X demake and some of this stuff.

1863
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:47,795
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think makes these demakes so popular where people go back in time and remake games such as like Team Fortress 2 or whatever the game is.

1864
02:20:48,055 --> 02:20:53,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think people want to keep remaking or Guitar Hero has had tons of these like in the Commodore 64 and stuff.

1865
02:20:53,499 --> 02:20:56,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do people want to remake these games on old systems?

1866
02:20:56,261 --> 02:20:57,642
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think is the allure of it?

1867
02:20:59,042 --> 02:20:59,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's kind of like

1868
02:21:00,387 --> 02:21:02,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost the opposite of the, what was that?

1869
02:21:04,688 --> 02:21:16,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the opposite of, say, just a second here, how Mega Man X, one of the later X games, took the classic Mega Man action to a pseudo-3D view.

1870
02:21:17,692 --> 02:21:21,773
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of strange seeing a new medium exactly like with the Guitar Hero Commodore remake.

1871
02:21:23,073 --> 02:21:23,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1872
02:21:25,495 --> 02:21:25,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1873
02:21:26,075 --> 02:21:27,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get into a whole lot of these.

1874
02:21:27,896 --> 02:21:34,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I necessarily... Usually I'm just kind of like, oh, hmm, that's neat, but I don't really have to play the whole thing in its entirety.

1875
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:38,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of interesting that there's this whole kind of community around there, around the demakes.

1876
02:21:39,422 --> 02:21:40,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I always thought it was interesting.

1877
02:21:41,143 --> 02:21:42,664
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a Silent Hill 2 demake.

1878
02:21:42,804 --> 02:21:45,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was like Soundless Mountain 2.

1879
02:21:46,306 --> 02:21:46,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1880
02:21:46,866 --> 02:21:47,586
[SPEAKER_06]: For what system?

1881
02:21:47,666 --> 02:21:47,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1882
02:21:49,327 --> 02:21:49,747
[SPEAKER_09]: PC.

1883
02:21:50,468 --> 02:21:50,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

1884
02:21:51,528 --> 02:21:52,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1885
02:21:52,029 --> 02:21:54,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Google TIG source.

1886
02:21:55,202 --> 02:21:58,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how they pulled that off.

1887
02:21:58,064 --> 02:21:58,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Dig Dug Demake?

1888
02:21:58,485 --> 02:22:01,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't Dig Dug kind of an old-ass game to begin with?

1889
02:22:01,587 --> 02:22:01,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

1890
02:22:01,707 --> 02:22:01,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1891
02:22:01,927 --> 02:22:04,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure they had a Bioshock Demake, too.

1892
02:22:24,690 --> 02:22:26,872
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I've seen the Bioshock demake.

1893
02:22:26,952 --> 02:22:27,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1894
02:22:27,553 --> 02:22:28,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, there's a whole lot.

1895
02:22:28,774 --> 02:22:31,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, lots of positive feedback to Cave Story in our chatroom.

1896
02:22:32,097 --> 02:22:35,801
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru says, but yeah, Cave Story is a Metroidvania worth buying and it's free on PC.

1897
02:22:36,021 --> 02:22:37,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Any PC gamer should own it.

1898
02:22:38,263 --> 02:22:39,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to just seek that out.

1899
02:22:40,265 --> 02:22:42,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So you found that amongst all the chat about Wang?

1900
02:22:43,868 --> 02:22:44,269
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1901
02:22:44,929 --> 02:22:46,911
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I haven't been paying attention to chat.

1902
02:22:46,931 --> 02:22:47,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1903
02:22:48,123 --> 02:22:49,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I have, but I haven't.

1904
02:22:49,544 --> 02:22:50,644
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the big deal with Wang?

1905
02:22:50,844 --> 02:22:51,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nothing.

1906
02:22:51,265 --> 02:22:52,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a discussion about Watchmen.

1907
02:22:52,766 --> 02:22:53,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, jeez.

1908
02:22:53,746 --> 02:22:53,986
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1909
02:22:54,426 --> 02:22:55,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I saw Watchmen.

1910
02:22:55,367 --> 02:22:56,448
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an amazing movie.

1911
02:22:56,608 --> 02:22:57,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you read the comics?

1912
02:22:58,669 --> 02:22:59,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I've read the comic.

1913
02:22:59,949 --> 02:23:02,431
[SPEAKER_09]: They almost used the book as a shooting script.

1914
02:23:03,251 --> 02:23:06,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of disappointed it left out the death of the first night owl, but they had to make room.

1915
02:23:07,353 --> 02:23:08,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, question for you.

1916
02:23:09,334 --> 02:23:12,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the movie ending was better or the comic ending?

1917
02:23:12,716 --> 02:23:14,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't spoil it, because I haven't seen it.

1918
02:23:14,057 --> 02:23:14,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't spoil it.

1919
02:23:14,597 --> 02:23:15,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say which one you prefer.

1920
02:23:16,405 --> 02:23:19,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly think that the movie ending better fits the audience today.

1921
02:23:19,207 --> 02:23:19,767
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my opinion.

1922
02:23:19,787 --> 02:23:22,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Without going into how hokey the comic one was.

1923
02:23:22,268 --> 02:23:23,349
[SPEAKER_09]: All my friends gave it bad reviews.

1924
02:23:23,369 --> 02:23:24,890
[SPEAKER_09]: They went in there expecting Spider-Man or Dark Knight.

1925
02:23:47,521 --> 02:23:49,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It's its own thing.

1926
02:23:49,423 --> 02:23:50,764
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is R-rated, folks.

1927
02:23:51,404 --> 02:23:53,186
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie ending doesn't make any sense.

1928
02:23:54,087 --> 02:23:54,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it does.

1929
02:23:54,847 --> 02:23:55,288
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't.

1930
02:23:55,308 --> 02:23:56,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you read the comics?

1931
02:23:56,149 --> 02:23:56,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

1932
02:23:58,791 --> 02:24:00,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Difference of opinion.

1933
02:24:00,352 --> 02:24:04,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make any sense because... I will go see it and be the Tyvo.

1934
02:24:05,016 --> 02:24:08,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Without trying to explain too much of the ending of the movie...

1935
02:24:09,858 --> 02:24:10,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1936
02:24:23,732 --> 02:24:25,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Except that it happened within the one country, too.

1937
02:24:25,854 --> 02:24:26,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so confused right now.

1938
02:24:26,774 --> 02:24:27,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter, though.

1939
02:24:28,195 --> 02:24:28,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1940
02:24:28,635 --> 02:24:28,896
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1941
02:24:29,576 --> 02:24:30,477
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll let them argue later.

1942
02:24:30,557 --> 02:24:31,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Another discussion.

1943
02:24:31,637 --> 02:24:33,319
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do a movie cast.

1944
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:33,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Someday.

1945
02:24:33,719 --> 02:24:34,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe as a one-off.

1946
02:24:34,419 --> 02:24:36,200
[SPEAKER_02]: We should call it Ultimate Spoiler Cast.

1947
02:24:37,321 --> 02:24:37,581
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1948
02:24:38,102 --> 02:24:40,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Ray, I've got to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show.

1949
02:24:40,763 --> 02:24:44,066
[SPEAKER_06]: But thanks so much, and I hope you had a good time on your first call.

1950
02:24:44,086 --> 02:24:45,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And call again sometime, okay?

1951
02:24:45,887 --> 02:24:46,107
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1952
02:24:46,127 --> 02:24:46,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.

1953
02:24:46,267 --> 02:24:47,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll call back next week.

1954
02:24:47,248 --> 02:24:47,508
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1955
02:24:47,568 --> 02:24:47,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Later, dude.

1956
02:24:48,148 --> 02:24:49,850
[SPEAKER_06]: We may not be here next week, but in two weeks.

1957
02:24:50,910 --> 02:24:51,231
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1958
02:24:51,251 --> 02:24:51,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1959
02:24:51,451 --> 02:24:51,651
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1960
02:24:51,691 --> 02:24:51,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1961
02:24:51,871 --> 02:24:51,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1962
02:24:53,368 --> 02:24:54,409
[SPEAKER_06]: We like first-time callers.

1963
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:56,011
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good note to end on tonight, I think.

1964
02:24:56,091 --> 02:24:57,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So sorry, guys, who didn't get through.

1965
02:24:57,613 --> 02:24:58,955
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to close up the Skype line for now.

1966
02:24:59,676 --> 02:25:03,981
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always send us emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, or, of course, we will continue to read chat comments throughout the night.

1967
02:25:04,261 --> 02:25:05,442
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have some last-minute stories.

1968
02:25:05,723 --> 02:25:10,248
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I'm sorry we didn't get to you, but, hey, if I hadn't taken that call, it wouldn't have been a first-time caller.

1969
02:25:10,889 --> 02:25:12,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have been burping.

1970
02:25:14,173 --> 02:25:22,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so there is a marketing stunt that went kind of nuts.

1971
02:25:23,416 --> 02:25:29,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually by Monument PR for Friday the 13th for the launch of Resident Evil 5.

1972
02:25:31,138 --> 02:25:33,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically the big stunt was a treasure hunt.

1973
02:25:34,359 --> 02:25:44,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, where about 50 members of the public would go and retrieve arms, legs, heads, and torsos from a number of different areas.

1974
02:25:45,568 --> 02:25:48,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, um,

1975
02:25:51,371 --> 02:25:55,896
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically part of the big campaign.

1976
02:25:56,596 --> 02:26:01,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So they hid all the body parts within a square mile of London.

1977
02:26:01,762 --> 02:26:04,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in bins and on window ledges.

1978
02:26:05,145 --> 02:26:06,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And 100 people signed up.

1979
02:26:09,169 --> 02:26:10,631
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically...

1980
02:26:12,899 --> 02:26:19,868
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually said that the people paying attention to it, passers-by, complained to the police.

1981
02:26:20,529 --> 02:26:26,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And officers were there at the finishing line to greet the people who were trying to assemble the bodies.

1982
02:26:26,877 --> 02:26:28,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's...

1983
02:26:30,921 --> 02:26:34,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I read about this earlier in the week and the whole thing sounded stupid.

1984
02:26:34,264 --> 02:26:35,725
[SPEAKER_06]: It did look kind of gross.

1985
02:26:36,125 --> 02:26:41,430
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just certain things that you gotta wonder who the hell thought this was a good idea, right?

1986
02:26:42,010 --> 02:26:42,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was just me.

1987
02:26:43,471 --> 02:26:43,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1988
02:26:44,252 --> 02:26:47,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, well thank you to our emailer and to Jamie for that one.

1989
02:26:47,815 --> 02:26:48,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, did you have anything tonight?

1990
02:26:49,475 --> 02:26:50,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Just some small stuff.

1991
02:26:51,236 --> 02:26:58,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Watchmen The End of Nigh 2 has been announced, and apparently it is more of the same.

1992
02:26:58,601 --> 02:27:02,544
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it's supposed to be a little bit racier.

1993
02:27:02,884 --> 02:27:09,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's been rated by the ESRB and describes some sexual content in there, including... Nice.

1994
02:27:10,088 --> 02:27:12,190
[SPEAKER_05]: There's... Let's see here.

1995
02:27:14,111 --> 02:27:16,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, basically the sexual content, I guess, is the more racier part.

1996
02:27:17,553 --> 02:27:18,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't know the blue peen.

1997
02:27:19,591 --> 02:27:21,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not necessarily in there.

1998
02:27:21,692 --> 02:27:30,575
[SPEAKER_05]: As a Watchmen, I guess you'll fight in a strip club that includes go-go dancers in cages, peep show booths, and a pornographic film in the background.

1999
02:27:32,276 --> 02:27:37,798
[SPEAKER_05]: However, in case you haven't played the first Watchmen, it sucks.

2000
02:27:38,118 --> 02:27:40,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if it's more of the same, it's more of the suck.

2001
02:27:40,879 --> 02:27:41,779
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't buy it.

2002
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:44,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least try the demo.

2003
02:27:46,042 --> 02:27:54,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, apparently Peter Moore of EA is saying that Wii Motion Plus is going to put an end to lazy Wiimote gaming.

2004
02:27:54,808 --> 02:28:05,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, apparently the 1.1 motion capture that is part of Wii Motion Plus requires you to actually make the full swing when playing a golf game or a tennis game.

2005
02:28:05,276 --> 02:28:07,357
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't just, like, move your wrists a little bit.

2006
02:28:08,818 --> 02:28:11,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is great, because that will encourage more people to throw stuff through their TV.

2007
02:28:12,321 --> 02:28:12,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

2008
02:28:14,242 --> 02:28:14,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

2009
02:28:15,339 --> 02:28:19,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Now of course we talked about earlier a free PopCap game you can get on St.

2010
02:28:19,523 --> 02:28:27,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Paddy's Day, but of course there's going to be some more stuff coming out as well, including LittleBigPlanet is going to be giving away a free St.

2011
02:28:27,551 --> 02:28:29,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Paddy's Day costume.

2012
02:28:30,154 --> 02:28:38,682
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll include a beard, a shiny green suit, a green top hat, and other stuff to make your character look like a leprechaun.

2013
02:28:40,164 --> 02:28:45,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, in April, there's going to be another free costume that's a Monkey King costume.

2014
02:28:45,348 --> 02:28:50,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, it was the winning entry of the PlayStation Asia contest, the design costume contest.

2015
02:28:51,492 --> 02:29:00,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's some more paid costumes coming out later, including a Killzone minipack, Buzz minipack, Patapon costume, and a Heavenly Sword minipack as well.

2016
02:29:01,941 --> 02:29:03,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want some more damn expansions.

2017
02:29:03,562 --> 02:29:04,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I want.

2018
02:29:05,303 --> 02:29:07,185
[SPEAKER_05]: More stuff like Metal Gear Solid, because that's awesome.

2019
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:12,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, Resident Evil 5 is already going to get some download content.

2020
02:29:12,566 --> 02:29:14,088
[SPEAKER_05]: The versus download content.

2021
02:29:14,208 --> 02:29:15,610
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been dated in Japan.

2022
02:29:16,391 --> 02:29:20,256
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be available for 250 yen and 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live.

2023
02:29:20,296 --> 02:29:20,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It is...

2024
02:29:26,783 --> 02:29:27,063
[SPEAKER_05]: That is it.

2025
02:29:27,083 --> 02:29:27,303
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2026
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:49,941
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I'll start with you.

2027
02:29:49,961 --> 02:29:50,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Your final thought.

2028
02:29:50,941 --> 02:29:51,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Blarg.

2029
02:29:51,102 --> 02:29:54,063
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is Cherry 7-Up is delicious, and I've had two cans tonight during the show.

2030
02:29:54,083 --> 02:29:54,764
[SPEAKER_06]: That can't be healthy.

2031
02:29:54,804 --> 02:29:55,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought.

2032
02:29:55,404 --> 02:29:56,405
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is Peggle is fun.

2033
02:30:17,362 --> 02:30:18,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's going to do it.

2034
02:30:18,683 --> 02:30:22,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting Independent Radio.

2035
02:30:22,164 --> 02:30:24,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, if you like what you hear, we do this for free.

2036
02:30:24,225 --> 02:30:24,945
[SPEAKER_06]: We do it for fun.

2037
02:30:24,986 --> 02:30:25,566
[SPEAKER_06]: We do it for you.

2038
02:30:25,946 --> 02:30:27,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tell two people you know about the show.

2039
02:30:27,907 --> 02:30:33,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Help us spread the word because word of mouth is how we are able to spread the word about our show.

2040
02:30:34,090 --> 02:30:34,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it.

2041
02:30:35,350 --> 02:30:37,951
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be back maybe next week.

2042
02:30:38,031 --> 02:30:40,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned to the website for updates on the show.

2043
02:30:40,893 --> 02:30:43,494
[SPEAKER_06]: But for sure in two weeks we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2044
02:30:43,514 --> 02:30:44,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So until then, thank you guys.

2045
02:30:45,075 --> 02:30:45,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great night.

2046
02:30:46,607 --> 02:30:49,368

2047
02:30:49,888 --> 02:30:53,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

[SPEAKER_03]: See you next week!
