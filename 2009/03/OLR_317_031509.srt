00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,880
Today, March 15, 2009, GamePro goes game publisher, Call of Duty passes a landmark for online

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,760
play, and which company is giving away a free game this week?

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,960
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,200
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
lifestyle.

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,920
And we tape live every Sunday night on allgames.com.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,680
That's www.allgames.com, All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show about

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,680
six o'clock Pacific Standard Time on the West Coast, nine o'clock Eastern for the East Coast.

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,640
My name is Robert, I'm just joining you here every week.

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,080
Joining us also every week, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
How's it going?

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm good.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
How are you, Tech Master Loki?

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Doing good.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,480
All right, excellent.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,560
And also joining us tonight, running fresh in from inside the house, live radio.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,040
Say hello to the one and only, Jamie Summers, how you doing?

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,520
I had beer last night and I feel good.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Did you?

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Congratulations.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
Much beer was had.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
But you always drink responsibly, correct?

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,600
Yep, that's why I have someone else be responsible for me.

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
All right, excellent.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,320
All right, and of course, not only do we tape live on All Games Radio, but you can also

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,240
watch our video feed on Justin TV.

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,560
Just before the show went live tonight, we were taking a peek at Madworld on the Nintendo

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
Wii, which I guess has quickly become one of Loki's favorite games?

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Yes.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,720
And what is it about Madworld that you're loving?

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Everything.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,520
You brutally murder people.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,040
Yeah, I saw you throw the guy into the air jet or something like that, just blood everywhere.

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,440
Describe this game a little bit for those that have no idea what this game is or the

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,320
fact that a game like this exists on the Nintendo Wii of all things, try to describe this game

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
real quick.

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,800
This game is sort of like, um, a little bit like The Running Man.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Basically, you are... the terrorists have taken over this one city and they've kind

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,840
of created this giant murder game show out of it.

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,120
And you're this guy, Jack, who decides to go ahead and enter this.

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,040
And basically all the contestants have a poison that's in them and they have to win the competition

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,700
to get the antidote.

43
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,520
So that's what he's doing is trying to kill everybody to get to rank number one.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,880
Was this a Stephen King novel?

45
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
No.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,200
Except they were running.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,920
That was the Long Walk, Rob.

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Similar.

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Similarities, though.

50
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,560
But basically, the whole game looks like it's a black and white comic book with lots of

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,360
splashes of red when you brutally murder people.

52
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,200
And I mean, everything from snapping people in half at their spine to cutting them in

53
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,760
half with a chainsaw in multiple ways, to throwing them against a spike wall, to setting

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,440
them on fire, stabbing them with, you know, street signs.

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,160
There's so many different ways to kill people.

56
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,480
It's like, yeah, the graphics are like that old joke.

57
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,600
You know the old joke, what's black and white and red all over?

58
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,960
But, you know, it's like the newspaper is like the riddle or if you're a smart ass,

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,320
it's a zebra that just got shot.

60
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,000
But now you could say what's black and white and red all over.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,560
Mad World is really what the graphics look like.

62
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,200
You are black and white and occasionally red.

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
It's very red.

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,560
As it is, you know, the game would be awesome just with that.

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,760
But oh no, Sega does not just stop there.

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,280
They decide that we need sports commentators as well.

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
And who'd they get?

68
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,400
Greg Proops and John DiMaggio.

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,640
John DiMaggio you might remember as the voice of Bender and Greg Proops from Whose Line.

70
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,560
They should have gotten Madden.

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
John Madden?

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,240
John, or at least Frank Caliendo.

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,920
You gotta, that would be awesome.

74
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
You gotta save something for the sequel though.

75
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
And I can guarantee there will be a sequel.

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,460
And honestly, Greg Proops is amazing and, you know, he was the announcer in Star Wars

77
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,800
Phantom Menace during the podrace, right?

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
I think so.

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,520
Anyhow, enough fanboy over Mad World.

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,680
I'm sure Loki will talk about this a little more in just a minute.

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,800
But first, we're gonna get to how was your gaming week and we do always start it off

82
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
ladies first.

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,960
Um, I played some Ragnarok.

85
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
That's really about it.

86
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,480
We've actually been having a different sort of gaming experience in my house, which is

87
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,120
called Cleaning Out the Vault.

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,360
I found so much E3 swag and no one, no one wants any of it, guys, trust me, it's shit.

89
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,640
Um, but we've been piling up our systems and realized that we have four Saturns, two Coleco

90
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Visions.

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,240
Dude, I want a Saturn.

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Talk to my husband.

93
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I have two Saturns.

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
No, I don't, I don't.

95
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I don't know why I would.

96
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
I have two Saturns I don't play.

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
What would I play on the Saturn, seriously?

98
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,000
But we're debating taking one of our systems and doing a giveaway with it and having, you

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,240
know, us autograph it or something, you know, maybe who wants a Coleco Vision?

100
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Hey.

101
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Uh, okay.

102
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,920
Good luck getting that shit to work.

103
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
It works just fine.

104
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Does it really?

105
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Coleco Visions are awesome.

106
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,560
Can you even hook those up to newer TVs?

107
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,720
We actually would be, yes, you can do, they have the, um, RCA or not RCA, the, uh, RF.

108
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,100
Yeah, they have an RF, but, um, but we also have, um, uh, drive two driving wheels.

109
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,920
So we'd have a spare driving wheel.

110
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,720
One of ours is Canadian.

111
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,200
Um, we have my Super Nintendo, which was the very first system I bought with my own money.

112
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
That was cool.

113
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,040
And the person who owned it before me smoked because it's all yellow.

114
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,880
Um, so yeah, we've got piles of stuff just hanging around and so, hey.

115
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,920
All right, maybe a giveaway, maybe.

116
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:41,060
Maybe, but we, we did also, um, we have a stack of old, um, strategy guides.

117
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,760
A number of them from the eighties.

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,700
Hey, some of that stuff goes for money on eBay.

119
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,280
We have how to win at Castlevania.

120
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
That's funny.

121
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Nice.

122
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,440
You win at Castlevania, buy a Dracula, whoo, like in a car.

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,600
Uh, I'm going to also introduce the chat room right now at this time, chat.orangelandraday.com

124
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,700
always when we're taping live on Sunday nights, you know, the listener experience and getting

125
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,040
to interact with the show is really what makes this show unique.

126
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,320
Um, just kind of reading some comments here from the chat room, um, Tigerclaw says Greg

127
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,920
Proops is awesome.

128
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,280
Black Wolf points out John DiMaggio is also the voice of Marcus Fenix and he should have

129
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,000
done it, and I'm sorry, Quiltipo says John DiMaggio should have done it in his Waka voice.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,040
Maybe, I don't know about that.

131
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,920
Waka kind of got on my, oh, Waka kind of got on my nerves by the end of Final Fantasy X,

132
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,360
but maybe that's just me.

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,920
Uh, let's see, other thoughts on gaming week.

134
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,560
Loki, how was your gaming week?

135
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,760
My gaming week was good, I, um, played a few things actually this week, um, starting off

136
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,880
with an, I don't know why I decided to try this, Pagle DS.

137
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,080
Why have I, you know, it's sad that I found Pagle now, because it is quite addicting.

138
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,320
Um, Yeah, wait, I don't know why you're knocking it, isn't it?

139
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Isn't this a good thing?

140
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm not knocking it, I'm saying, ah, Pagle, there's something else to be addicted to,

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
okay.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh, okay, I gotcha.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,800
It was kind of fun, um, so, that's pretty cool, and, um, have you checked out the one

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
on Xbox yet?

145
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
No.

146
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,440
Okay, because I was going to ask you, how is it different on the DS, well, have you

147
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,840
played any other version of Pagle?

148
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
No.

149
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Okay, then never mind, you can't answer my question.

150
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,480
I was going to ask, is it, how is it different on the DS, but I guess you can't answer that.

151
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,500
It's not really that different, I don't think, from anything else, it's, I mean, basically,

152
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,880
you control it with the stylus to aim, and then when you hold the stylus in one spot,

153
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,080
it'll zoom in, and then you can fine aim with that.

154
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Oh, that's pretty cool.

155
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,880
And then, um, you know, you stop, button, and it'll shoot, and that's it.

156
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Um.

157
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,440
SSJ100Matt asks the wife test question, asking would Nellie play Pagle?

158
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,920
Maybe, I haven't shown it to her yet.

159
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
You've got cookies!

160
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Um.

161
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,880
For those that are randomly yelling out, my roommate just popped in the studio here, um,

162
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,240
and it has a really big smirk on his face, I'm trying to figure out, oh boy, okay, John

163
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,960
wants to speak on the show.

164
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,440
Did we give you a nickname on this show, John?

165
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
My roommate?

166
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,280
My secret nickname is either Roommate or John.

167
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,480
Okay, your secret nickname is Roommate or John, we gotta get you a mic here.

168
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Alright.

169
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,760
Your superhero name would be the roomie.

170
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,480
I'm gonna make this short, um, I don't usually play tons and tons of video games, but iPhone

171
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,960
game app called Arveil, completely amazing, old school Final Fantasy style game, haven't

172
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,520
been able to stop playing it for like three days, and it's fantastic, and I actually paid

173
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,240
for the paid version, which is unspeakable and unheard of.

174
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
So that's my little plug.

175
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,160
Wait, tell us a little, how'd you find this game?

176
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,640
Tell us a little more about how it plays, because this is unheard of that you actually

177
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,800
want to participate in the show, and about video games, and not making fun of me, so

178
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,600
I'm, I definitely want to know a little bit more about how you found this and how it plays

179
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,320
and all that, like, you know, how do you control it on an iPhone?

180
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,880
It's pretty simple, there's a little action button for most things, and there's a little

181
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,200
control pad, so it's, you know, left, right, up, down, diagonals, um, found it going through

182
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,920
strategy games that were free on the iPhone, and then liked it so much I bought the paid

183
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
version.

184
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,080
It plays like an old school Final Fantasy, like, maybe Final Fantasy 5 or so, I think,

185
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
and...

186
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,240
Wait, am I filling in for Jamie?

187
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,480
Am I supposed to, like, grow tits tonight, or be extra sassy?

188
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,920
She's just going to the loo, I think.

189
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,240
She's going to the soda, which is kind of like the loo?

190
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,480
Maybe we should keep the soda in the bathroom.

191
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,520
Okay, um, what else was I going to ask, though?

192
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,520
Is this game available anywhere else that you know of, or, because some folks in our

193
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,040
chat room are saying, I don't have an iPhone, so are they just screwed?

194
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Then I would say that their life is incomplete and they need to go buy an iPhone.

195
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
These are obvious things.

196
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,720
I don't know why I'm having to tell your listeners this.

197
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,520
Apple thanks you for the free plug.

198
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
All right.

199
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,800
All right, well, thank you, John, for your contributions.

200
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,560
Wait, you forgot to wave to Justin.TV.

201
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
They're very mad.

202
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,160
They had to look at your butt the whole time you were talking, and now they want some recognition.

203
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
All right.

204
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,960
Anyhow, uh, Loki.

205
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm so sorry about that.

206
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,040
Anyways, that's okay, that's okay.

207
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,240
Other than Pagel DS, I also played Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, which is interesting.

208
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,480
It's definitely a different take on Grand Theft Auto, well, not that different, I mean,

209
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,360
it's very similar to 1 and 2, but having come off of 4 and Lost and Damned, it is kind of

210
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,800
hard to go back to the 2D stuff, or top-down Grand Theft Auto games, but it's okay.

211
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,160
Very similar to the older games, they did add some neat touch screen stuff into it as

212
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,400
well.

213
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,960
Haven't played a whole lot of it yet, so I can't give a full impression on it yet, but

214
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,000
it's okay so far.

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,560
Storyline's kind of, eh, but we'll see, I mean, it might get better, but right now it's

216
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
kind of cheesy.

217
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,200
And then, other than DS stuff, I have also played, of course, more Lost and Damned, still

218
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,860
lots of multiplayer in that.

219
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,880
Playing around with the glitch of the game, there's a spot where pedestrians spawn in

220
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,200
the middle of the air and fall from the sky.

221
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,640
Sounds kind of fun.

222
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,720
And then, I played a little bit of PS3 today, I went ahead and finally got around to playing

223
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,640
the little big planet Contra levels, so that was kind of fun.

224
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,000
And I also went and played Nobby, Nobby Boy for a few, I would say, yeah, a few seconds

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,880
until Nelly's like, that bass sound when you're stretching is really fucking annoying, so

226
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,360
I had to turn it off, so I stopped playing that.

227
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,600
Yeah, pretty much.

228
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
She cracked the whip, you had to stop playing.

229
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,640
And then, of course, you know, Mad World, you know, that game's awesome in all sorts

230
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,440
of ways, and unfortunately I haven't really made it past the first level, because I haven't

231
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,920
gotten a chance to actually sit down and play it for a long enough time, so.

232
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,600
The first level's really cool, though, so I can't wait.

233
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,920
Alright.

234
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,400
Well, my gaming week was actually pretty busy, considering I was out of town for like three

235
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,680
days, I didn't think I'd have a very busy gaming week, the only thing I really played

236
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,840
on the plane was Metroid Zero.

237
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes, I went back, and it's my second favorite Metroid game, next to Super Metroid, I went

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,560
back and played on my DS, the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot, Metroid Zero, because that

239
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,160
game is pretty fantastic, especially because I'm such a fan of Super Metroid, of course

240
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm going to like Metroid Zero, it's practically the same thing, but, you know, with different

241
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,440
levels and a different layout.

242
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,480
So if, you know, you need an oldie but goodie to check out, because this game's probably

243
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,240
about five years old now, I think it's from 04, check out Metroid Zero, it was one of

244
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,880
the last Advance games, I think, before they started switching over to DS stuff.

245
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,620
Otherwise, as far as other stuff goes, I actually took a trip last night with Rice Princess,

246
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,160
we went out to Roseville Golf Land, which is the local arcade, and we've given it a

247
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,480
lot of crap on this show, because Roseville Golf Land is the place where games go to die.

248
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,040
That's what we've always talked about here on the show, because you go there and, you

249
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,160
know, you just have to imagine, for those, you know, I know not everybody lives where

250
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,280
we live and knows this place, but it's a giant castle with a big golf course and a big water

251
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,880
park that they're known for, but it's just like they let little kids just run the frickin'

252
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,560
place because of it, and, of course, they don't know how to treat machines, parents

253
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
don't know how to police their children in a place like that, so the machines-

254
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,240
And they change their diapers on the machines.

255
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,760
Are always, yeah, oh god, and if you think she's lying, that's a completely true story,

256
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,960
that a diaper was once changed on a keyboard mania machine, but regardless, the machines

257
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,280
run down, broken, bleh, but we heard they got a BeatMania 2DX machine, so we had to

258
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,540
go check it out, and you know what?

259
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:44,260
We went, and I hadn't been in like a year, 18 months or so, and color me shocked, but

260
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,440
the place looked really nice.

261
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,600
Like they remodeled or something, they did some repainting in there, I didn't find a

262
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,440
machine that was broken, everything looked to be in a good state, I mean, granted, I

263
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,260
saw a Supernova 2, the monitor was a little junky, but honestly, considering all the parts

264
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,920
worked, the Max2 pads worked great, 2DX was in awesome condition, they've come a long

265
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
way.

266
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,640
I don't know if they're under new management or what the hell's going on over there, but

267
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,200
we have to admit when things change for the better, and I think that-

268
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,880
It's winter, that's why, no money for the water park.

269
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,320
Maybe, I don't know, but I've been there in winter before and been extremely disappointed,

270
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,360
so I don't know what's going on, but it's working, whatever they're doing, so props

271
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,560
to those guys, and sorry for giving you so much crap, but I guess it worked, because

272
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,480
the place was in a good state, so I played BeatMania 2DX Distorted, which I played before

273
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,880
because I had it at E3 a few years ago, but I haven't really touched BeatMania 2DX in

274
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,160
a long time, like it's been a long, long time, probably since this show took a more general

275
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,080
gaming approach as opposed to just music video games that we used to do, but I missed it,

276
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
it was fun.

277
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,820
Granted, I found myself playing all old songs, but yeah, I definitely want to go back and

278
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
play some more.

279
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,000
I had a really good time playing BeatMania 2DX, although I still think the newer songs

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,440
are not nearly as good as the older songs, I'm sorry to say.

281
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,200
Questions from chat, Floatwalk wants to know, does R. Vigal still have Disney's Rave?

282
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,120
Yes they do, I didn't play it though, but they do have Disney's Rave, and Rice Princess

283
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,000
is actually in chat right now saying 2DX was in excellent shape and loud, so yeah, the

284
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
machine was nice and loud, because you could turn the effectors on and all that.

285
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,840
So tell them about, was it Guitar Hero Arcade?

286
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,560
Yes, they had Guitar Hero Arcade which I played, I only played it once, so I can't really give

287
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,600
a full review on it, I can just tell you I got pissed off, because Roseville Golf Land

288
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,640
also switched to cards, they don't use tokens anymore, but cards, and when I was swiping

289
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,960
the card through and everything, I somehow hit the button an extra time to start the

290
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,000
game and I accidentally got on easy mode, and you can't switch it once you're on easy

291
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
mode.

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,160
But to me, honestly, it just looked like the freaking home game, except a smaller song

293
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,040
list, and it was just basically Guitar Hero 3 with a slightly smaller song list, and prettier

294
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,760
because there's lights on the machine and it spins around and the TV they use is very

295
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,820
very crisp, it's a very sharp image, but I don't know, would you want to pay a dollar

296
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,200
a game for something you can get at home?

297
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,480
But I understand there is an audience for this thing, and it's kind of cool to go out

298
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,220
and play with your friends and all that stuff, so I can see where this machine might do decent,

299
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:23,280
but if you have Guitar Hero at home, I don't see the point in this game, honestly.

300
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,200
Let's see, what else did I do in my gaming week this week?

301
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,720
I played the demo of The Last Remnant on the PC, and I was a little disappointed at how

302
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,320
choppy it was, and I just bought this PC back in August, so I know it's not like old parts

303
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,800
or anything, but I was a little disappointed at how choppy it was, but the game itself

304
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,720
seemed kind of fun, so I might try to check it out on Xbox 360, although the PC wasn't

305
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
supposed to have all the extra stuff.

306
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,040
Pagle on Xbox Live Arcade, I downloaded and played for a while, and good times.

307
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,160
You know, I was already addicted to the one online, it's Sparkles and Rainbows and Plinko,

308
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,500
it's fun.

309
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,520
I need to play some more of the multiplayer though before I can kind of give my full impressions

310
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,680
on that, but I had fun playing Pagle, and I think a lot of people are going to check

311
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
this out.

312
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,880
What I like about Pagle versus PopCap's other efforts on Xbox Live, such as Bejeweled 2

313
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,280
and Zuma, is that this doesn't just feel like a port of their PC game, the full one, it

314
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,080
feels like they've really tinkered some stuff to work with Xbox Live, hence the multiplayer,

315
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,280
and they've really kind of made it special for Xbox Live, and I think that's what's kind

316
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,120
of cool about Pagle, it makes it really stand out amongst some of PopCap's other games they've

317
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,360
had on Xbox Live so far.

318
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,820
Not to say the other stuff was bad, but it was just kind of the same thing that I'd already

319
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:39,120
played on PC if I'd had the full version, and Pagle's kind of a step above that.

320
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,960
The last game I will mention that I played this week, Dance Dance Revolution Universe

321
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,120
3 was on sale, so I figured, what the heck, I picked it up, I bought it, because I got

322
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,000
a new dance mat for Xbox, whatever, and got to play Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3.

323
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Do you want to know what the most hilarious thing about Dance Dance Revolution Universe

324
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
3 is?

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,160
Okay, they, on the back of the box, they advertise these songs that are in the game, one of them

326
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,000
being harder, better, faster, stronger, right?

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,180
So I was like, okay, I want to check that song out.

328
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,680
It's not in the game.

329
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,320
In fact, of all the songs that are mentioned on the back of the box, apparently only one

330
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,880
of them is actually in the game, and no, it's not, like, I looked on web forums, DDR Freak,

331
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,800
which is still kicking after all these years, who knew, DDR Freak apparently confirms these

332
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,280
songs are not in the game, but they're advertised on the back of the box.

333
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Well, that's false advertising.

334
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
I know!

335
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,920
I say, we sue Konami.

336
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
What's up with that?

337
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,280
We'll turn it around on him.

338
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Look, I understand.

339
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,760
No, we will sue Konami.

340
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,800
I understand mistakes happen and all, but this is a pretty fucking big mistake.

341
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,160
You know what I mean?

342
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
I don't know.

343
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,200
That's, that's, I'm surprised they're not trying to send out stickers to Critter.

344
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,960
How does something like that happen?

345
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,280
Like, who fucked up that bad?

346
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,440
It's been out for a while, they probably just figured no one has noticed, you know?

347
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
My god.

348
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,040
Um, but look, look, the game itself, look, putting the box aside and all that trite crap,

349
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,740
you know, the game itself is okay.

350
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,880
It's not my favorite home version of a DDR game.

351
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,720
In fact, I think I even preferred the song list in Universe 1.

352
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,400
It's definitely no Ultramix 2.

353
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,800
But it's not bad.

354
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:19,360
The interface is pretty slick, very crisp, very vibrant graphics, funny background animations,

355
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,680
2DX fan service, because they have the actual music video for Murmur Twins and some of that

356
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,240
stuff in the game, decent licensed songs, some really cute kind of original stuff.

357
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,360
A little heavy on certain in-house artists of Konami.

358
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,400
I guess maybe there's just been a shift over there where they're starting to use people

359
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,080
like Diamashura and 0039.com and some of these people are using them more often, it seems

360
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,760
like, than your Naoki, your Takus, and all these guys that probably left, which is why

361
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,000
they're having a shift.

362
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,420
Also I thought it was strange, the download content, the interface, you can't preview

363
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,800
the songs, I never heard of any of them, so I don't know what I want to download.

364
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,480
Do they even have download content?

365
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,640
My Universe, yeah they do.

366
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,920
My Universe 1 songs though did not come into Universe 3, but apparently there's a Universe

367
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,840
pack available, so I'm not sure if it's trying to make me re-buy the songs I already bought

368
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,480
with Universe 1, and if that's the case, that's kind of crappy.

369
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,560
There's a crap load of songs to unlock, so I'll give them a plus there.

370
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,360
There's tons and tons of songs to unlock.

371
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,260
Quest mode is a little silly though, and I hate how everybody speaks.

372
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,920
Everybody talks like people think ghetto people talk.

373
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,880
That's how the dialogue has gone, like the whole yo-dog type stuff, like, oh everybody,

374
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
it's just bad.

375
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,360
Dialogue by Randy Jackson.

376
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
It's bad.

377
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,840
Leo Shan asks, was the quest mode like you got served Sky?

378
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
No, it's weird.

379
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,760
It's like this big circular thing, and you go to these different places, and in the first

380
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,200
circle you gain coins to challenge people in the second circle, and if you beat them

381
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,320
you get the song.

382
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,840
It wasn't incredibly difficult.

383
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,280
I unlocked the entire second circle in one night, but now it won't let me go to the third

384
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,160
circle because I haven't played enough in the first circle, but I don't want to play

385
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,680
the easy stuff, but whatever.

386
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,720
Eventually you'll get to the seventh ring of hell.

387
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,840
It's just like, here's the thing, I don't want to necessarily give this game a negative

388
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,520
review because I don't think it's necessarily bad, and I do encourage people to play DDR

389
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,480
because I think it's a way to stay fit and exercise, and again, I think everything's

390
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
pretty sharp.

391
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,120
I don't necessarily like some of the creative direction they took in it.

392
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,560
I don't think the new quest mode is anything that exciting.

393
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,920
I don't think the new interface is that great.

394
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,960
I think having the giant CD cover box art thing in the wheels is a bit much.

395
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,840
I don't go for it.

396
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,960
I'm telling you, if you make me the production director of this series, I could bring it

397
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,560
around like nothing.

398
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,040
It's not necessarily bad.

399
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:53,720
It's just another DDR game, and at this point these things are a dime a dozen, so I really

400
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,720
want to see the DDR teams at Konami really try to reinvent this stuff, and for the love

401
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,080
of God, whoever made that big mistake about putting songs on there that weren't actually

402
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:12,040
in the game, that just kind of speaks as to how lazy they're getting.

403
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,460
It's not necessarily a big deal, okay, so somebody made a mistake, whatever, but it

404
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,000
just speaks volume as to how lazy it feels like they're getting with DDR, which is sad

405
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,760
because I know there's a lot of people that work very hard on this series.

406
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,080
I've had friends who worked for the series that work very hard on it.

407
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,880
It's some of these creative things coming up from the top level.

408
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,720
I'm surprised they didn't make a big deal about that everywhere, because hell, they

409
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,240
made a big deal out of the IGN watermark being on the Okami cover, and that was something

410
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,520
really stupid and small and had no impact really on the game.

411
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,880
I don't know, and then there was Super Stardust Portable that was missing modes and stuff

412
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,020
that were advertised on there.

413
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,200
This is kind of a big deal that there's songs missing from the game that are advertised

414
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,320
on there, because that right there, say if you bought it for that song, you're being

415
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,080
ripped off right there, and the fact that it's not available for...

416
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,840
I don't think even download content would cut it, and it would have to be free download

417
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,240
content or a patch or something that would get automatically added to the game or something

418
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,360
when you connect it live, but I don't know, it's just cheap and they could have easily

419
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,800
affixed it with a sticker or something to go over that part of the box, that way it's

420
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,240
gone or something, say at the last minute they decided to pull the rights to it or something.

421
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,280
It screams lazy, that's all it is.

422
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,960
And I'm just saying, companies, don't think we don't notice when y'all get lazy.

423
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:42,000
There are people that notice and there are people that go, okay, I'm spending $60 of

424
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,840
my money on this game, take five seconds to...

425
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,720
It's like Nintendo again.

426
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,560
Or delay it, that's what every other company does.

427
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:57,320
The problem is, in their quest to branch out to people that haven't tried their games before,

428
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,360
or people that normally don't play their games, they have in turn lost the people that do

429
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,640
play their games, because they just don't care anymore.

430
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,480
It's like shifting your focus to actually increase your market share with groups of

431
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,680
people that don't normally play your games, and ignoring your core players and thinking

432
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,200
they're just going to stick around is not the way to be thinking.

433
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,600
Here's my challenge, this is my last thing I want to say, because I know there are people

434
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,480
at Konami that listen to this program, and I'm not just talking about people that are

435
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,800
like my personal friends and what have you, but I know there's people higher up.

436
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,000
Look, less than three is one of the songs in freaking DDR Universe 3, the same song

437
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,020
that was a theme song to Rice Princess' show she had on the old station, okay?

438
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,160
If that doesn't prove somebody at Konami is looking out for us, I don't know what does,

439
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
okay?

440
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,520
Here's the thing I want to say to y'all, look, I love DDR, DDR has introduced me to a lot

441
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,520
of great people, I would not know Loki, I would not know Dark Soccer if it were not

442
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,000
for DDR, however, that being said, do not throw away a good thing, do not be afraid

443
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,820
to reinvent yourselves, and I challenge you, step away from making, resist the temptation

444
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:11,000
of doing a Universe 4, or X2, or Disney 3, I want you to nuke your code and start from

445
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,560
the ground up, build a new DDR game from the ground up, no recycled code, make a brand

446
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,120
new DDR game, and really try to push the limits of what you're doing with it, I think you

447
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,820
would really stand to win back a lot of people that are starting to think you're getting

448
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
a little lazy.

449
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,480
They did it before, and what did it do for the community for a while, I mean it really

450
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,960
rejuvenated everything when we got the Max series, remember when it was new?

451
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,440
And honestly, DDR UltraMix, especially 2, not so much UltraMix 1, but UltraMix 2, and

452
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,080
they really were getting in their groove, no pun intended, sold me on an Xbox, it really

453
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
did.

454
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,880
And that was all new code, because they had to make it for the Xbox.

455
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,760
Also the other thing too, I think, is the way that they're treating their series, I

456
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,880
mean look at Pump It Up, and the new versions of that game, there's a lot of excitement

457
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,320
behind it, they bring it out, it's like, BAM, it's a new game, it's awesome, it's got all

458
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,280
these things in it, and people get excited about it, but DDR, it's like, oh, new DDR,

459
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:14,960
hooray, this time it's got more Disney characters, hurrah, it's just that no one cares anymore,

460
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,960
and they need to really change it up, I'm serious, I have a way to fix this, but no

461
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,320
one wants to listen, and I don't feel like explaining it, because, well, it's just, it's

462
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
all in my head, and unfortunately I can't put it on paper very, you know, but I can

463
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,800
explain it, basically the whole quest mode thing, taking a totally different approach

464
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,000
to that, basically you have stuff that goes along, because the problem with quest mode

465
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,020
is they don't know how to make it where it actually matters, I mean, you can't obviously

466
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,440
do it as like a dance off competition thing, because it doesn't make any sense, it's just,

467
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,840
you can't do that in DDR, because it's a technical game, it's not based on, you know, doing moves

468
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,520
and that kind of crap, but if you make it as something different, like say for example,

469
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,220
how well you're doing in a song affects the performance of say, something else that's

470
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,280
going on, totally separate things, you know, just basically instead of, you know, your

471
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,960
actions on a gamepad or something like that, it's based on the accuracy of, you know, the

472
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,640
steps that you're hitting and that kind of stuff, if you make that interact with the

473
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,160
other thing that's going on, you can make the quest mode about anything you want, and

474
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,440
it doesn't have to be about DDR or anything, you can just really broaden it out there.

475
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,160
Alright, we'll see if anyone's listening, you can contact Loki directly at loki at orange

476
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,280
launch reader dot com, I'm sure he'll talk your ear off about it. Let me read some comments

477
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,880
from chat, I don't want to spend too much more time on DDR, because since we have branched

478
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,760
out the scope of our show, I know there's some people that listen that don't really

479
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,400
care as much about the music games, but I will say this though, good exercise, you know,

480
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,520
if you've never played DDR, try it for the exercise alone. Let's see, comments from chat,

481
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,040
Float Walk says two words, national tournament, that's definitely what Pump It Up does, you

482
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,120
know, the tournaments they do in Korea are huge, and Float Walk says for crying out loud

483
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,720
the tournament scene made DDR's popularity in the states, true facts. Acidic Vampire

484
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:12,160
says what DDR needs is violence like Madworld. DDR does not need violence, at least not that

485
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,280
level of violence, I mean, no, it doesn't need that. DDR needs fatalities. But I do

486
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,840
agree that you could take the quest mode and literally make it like an RPG type thing,

487
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:29,840
you know, like it's, I don't know, it's, it's hard. No, no, no, no, no, no, I will tell

488
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,420
you a reason why RPG stuff will never work with Dance Dance Revolution, and it all goes

489
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:41,440
back to a little known game called Dance Dance Dance. No. I think I remember that game, yeah.

490
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,560
Yes, I've played it, and yes it sucks. Alright, anyhow, let's move on, I don't want to spend

491
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,640
too much time re-re-reminiscing the old days, although that's kind of what I did this week

492
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,000
by going to Golf Land, so there you go. Alright, since that does it for our gaming week, let's

493
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,680
get to some housekeeping. Alright, so look, we've sat here and kind of been critical of

494
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,920
DDR for the last few minutes, but I will say this, you know, at our heart we do love Konami,

495
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:13,160
and so on, on our website www.orangelandrater.com, they actually have been polling all of our

496
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,840
listeners all week long about your top three favorite Konami games since their 40th birthday

497
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,580
is coming up, and we're giving them a present now with this week long feature of the best

498
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,880
games as selected by you guys, the listeners, from Konami's archives. 1500 Konami games

499
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:34,320
over the years, if you can believe it. Speaking of voting, March Madness is almost over, it's

500
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,600
down to the final four, and right now you have Rock Band versus Super Mario Bros. 3,

501
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,960
and you have Chrono Trigger versus Zelda Link to the Past, and I believe voting time is

502
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,720
going to be up very, very soon, so if you're listening live here on this Sunday evening,

503
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,880
you're going to want to go try to get in your last minute votes, and the final two will

504
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,920
probably be decided tonight. March 22nd, next week, I'm not going to be here, so I'm not

505
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,440
sure if there's going to be a show or not. Stay tuned to our website www.orangelandrater.com

506
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,640
for more details, I think they might try to find a way to tape elsewhere, but I will not

507
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,220
be here next week, I'm going to be on a trip, but I will be back in two weeks, so we'll

508
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,320
keep you posted. Alright, that's really it for housekeeping, just stay tuned to our website.

509
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,760
Actually I want to say something about the website real fast, actually. I feel like I've

510
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,560
kind of been slacking off, because I haven't been doing a lot of articles for the website

511
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,840
or what have you, but it has been so refreshing to go to orangelandrater.com, and I'm seeing

512
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:35,660
new stuff every day, it's completely unreal, but some of our long-time listeners, like

513
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,280
Deakman, ActDeaf, DarkTedTsuya, and I'm sure the list goes on, I don't mean to leave people

514
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,840
out, but they've been writing articles about indie game spotlights, games you ought to

515
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,600
be playing, but you probably aren't, and highlighting music from video games, and it's been actually

516
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,520
really cool to kind of go to the site and see this stuff. And what I love about it,

517
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,920
is that in a way it's because we're not doing it, it's kind of what this show is all about,

518
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,240
letting the listeners have control, and the community, and what the community wants to

519
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,040
hear about, so props to you guys who've all been working hard on the website, it's been

520
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,520
pretty awesome. And I have an idea for a feature too that I'm hoping to contribute very soon,

521
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:19,080
and I'll be back on posting regular updates very soon. Okay, now I think that's it for

522
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,040
housekeeping, let's get into some gaming news, we're only like 30 minutes into the show,

523
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,960
let's get to it. Loki, start us off with some gaming news. Yes, so anyways, there has been

524
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:41,960
some concern by MTV's Totillo that there might not be enough exclusives during 2009 for the

525
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:48,320
Xbox 360. Now, unfortunately what Steven doesn't realize is that there are, but he just doesn't

526
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,000
understand that there are a lot of things coming out that people think that aren't exclusive

527
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
are exclusive, and that they think that are exclusive that aren't exclusive, so it's kind

528
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,400
of confusing. For example, he says the loss of Xbox exclusive franchises like Mass Effect,

529
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:11,880
unfortunately for him, Mass Effect, I don't think, as of right now, is not, well it is

530
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,620
multi-platform, but not with the PS3. So, you know, because right now I think there's

531
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:23,360
only a SKU listing for the Xbox 360 version, I think the other platform they're talking

532
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,000
about was PC, which makes sense, because they've released them both, but I think it is going

533
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,600
to be exclusive for Xbox 360 right now. And Project Gotham Racing, well, Project Gotham

534
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,680
Racing I don't think is even going to be existing anymore, at least if they are going to do

535
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,080
another Project Gotham Racing game, I think it's not going to be called Project Gotham

536
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,320
Racing, it'll probably be something different, but hey, who cares. And then of course Splinter

537
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,960
Cell Conviction, whenever the hell that comes out, you know, obviously it might be one that's

538
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,480
going to be on 360, and Alan Wake, also whenever that comes out as well. Then of course there's

539
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:03,000
also Halo 3 ODST, or whatever they're calling it now, and I mean that's just for right now.

540
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,360
Obviously they haven't really been talking much about their 2009 lineup, which they're

541
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,180
probably saving for E3, you know, they're just going to be like, bam bam bam bam, here's

542
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:16,320
all this shit, you know, that's coming out. But, do you think they are going to, at E3,

543
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,720
just blow us away? Um, maybe. I mean, because there's, I can kind of see where this guy

544
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,040
has some concerns for Xbox 360, because even, you know, they don't have a big Halo 3 this

545
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,360
year or anything of that caliber, I mean, granted you had Halo Wars, but it's not the

546
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,900
same thing. You know, there's no big, big must-have title, it feels like we got a lot

547
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:41,200
of that last year. Well, they're not going to let us down with just, you know, the Halo

548
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,340
ODST, and that could be what they consider their big title, but then again, that's also

549
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,800
right now for September, that's scheduled for September. I mean, we very well could

550
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,520
get something else, I don't know if they were going to get another Gears of War, to be honest

551
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,920
I hope not, you know, give it some space, but I think there's going to be other things

552
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:03,800
coming out for sure, because they definitely don't like leaving in a lot of months without

553
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,240
a Microsoft game coming out, and you know, right now we just had Halo Wars come out,

554
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,520
Ninja Blade's coming out pretty soon, you know, there's still a lot more months that

555
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,560
there's nothing been announced yet, and I wouldn't be surprised if there's other things,

556
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,680
and that's only first-party exclusives, we're not even talking about third-party exclusives

557
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:25,120
yet, but you know, right now, there are a lot of companies that just don't want to develop

558
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,640
for the PS3, or they're having trouble developing on the PS3, and it's taken them a lot longer

559
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,960
to put out the PS3 version. For example, this isn't a great game, but Leisure Suit Larry

560
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,760
boxed off his bus, coming out on 360 in a couple weeks, and the PS3 version's been delayed

561
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,640
to May. Another one that people thought is also going to be exclusive to the Xbox 360,

562
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,280
at least a timed exclusive, is Bioshock 2, right now I'm not seeing that, right now it's

563
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,920
day and date with the PS3 version, but of course, that can change, that's months off

564
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:02,200
right now, so I wouldn't be surprised if there is going to be a lot more stuff announced,

565
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,920
and Bioshock 2 is going to be a huge Christmas title, but it's not specific to any system.

566
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,240
Yeah, well, I think it actually is going to be coming out in August, just like it did

567
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,560
the first time, but there's tons of stuff coming out that we don't know about yet, that

568
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:21,840
are going to be big titles, and I'm sure that each side, both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 are

569
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,760
both going to have exclusive titles that are going to be really awesome, so I don't really

570
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,520
think it matters about the exclusive titles, because there's just more titles coming out

571
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:39,640
on the Xbox 360 right now, period. Alright, you know, and also, one thing that Microsoft

572
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,200
usually does, and I'm sure Nintendo and Sony are going to do this too, especially speaking

573
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,960
of E3, you know, they like to unveil things to these big events that are available on

574
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,360
live right now, or on PlayStation Network right now. There's something else too that

575
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,080
I totally forgot about, Game Developers Conference, which I think is what, next week? Oh yeah.

576
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,120
Yeah, so I mean, there's going to be announcements probably there as well, I mean, there's lots

577
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,200
of stuff, and not only that, but they're not only focusing on just console stuff, I mean,

578
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,320
you've got XNA, which is really hitting its strides now, Xbox Live Arcade, who knows what

579
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
they're going to go with. I don't think at Game Developers Conference, though, you're

580
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,840
going to get huge game announcements, but I think you'll get, like, infrastructure type

581
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,440
things. Like, remember, Game Developers Conference was where, like, Home was announced. That

582
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,600
was kind of an enhancement to Sony's platform. I don't think XNA was announced at, or no,

583
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,600
I mean, XNA was, I mean, NXC, the new Xbox experience, I don't think that was announced

584
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,240
at Game Developers Conference, but I could see that being the type of thing, you know,

585
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,880
things that affect the developers, you know, things that affect the backbones of these

586
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,200
systems, or the types of announcements I would expect to see, you know, upgrades and things

587
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,500
of that note. Maybe this would be a great time for Nintendo to finally put out that

588
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,080
SD card thing they've been talking about. That would be great. I've got a 2GB card right

589
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:55,800
here, right here, just waiting to go in the Wii, to store all my crap. So, I'm hoping

590
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,920
that thing will come out soon. Alright, well, there will be, actually, wait, I've got to

591
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,160
read, there will be some comments from chat right now, that's the one I've got to read

592
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,600
right now. AcidicVampire is betting at E3 this year, Microsoft will reveal that Final

593
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:16,120
Fantasy XIII Versus will be on the Xbox 360. Hmm. I doubt that. You never know. GameGuru

594
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,520
says, Microsoft at E3 will announce that the best non-Sony games that are appearing on

595
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,040
PlayStation 3 will also be on the Xbox 360. Amazetatsuma corrects me and says, Microsoft

596
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,120
did Gears 2 was announced at Game Developers Conference. So, it is not unheard of for games

597
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,320
to be announced at E3. Yeah, because they're talking about the enhancements to Unreal 3,

598
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,520
that stuff. You might hear something about Unreal 4, maybe, I don't know, that might

599
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,240
be interesting. That could be. Maybe some stuff from id from about Doom 4, because I

600
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,480
think they're going to be talking about that and probably rage a little bit. What was I

601
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,200
going to say, though, yeah, the whole rumor thing about, like, Final Fantasy Versus, Square

602
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,840
has kind of already done that with Xbox 360. If you notice, the last few games that they

603
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:08,000
put out have been only on Xbox 360, and have been exclusive. Star Ocean, Last Hope, The

604
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Last Remnant, before that, oh gosh, I'm forgetting now, but yeah, a lot of their RPGs are going

605
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,200
to be, you know, strictly on the Xbox 360, but now they're going to start getting some

606
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,600
PS3 ones. Infinite Undiscovery, was the other one you were talking about? Yeah, Infinite

607
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:30,120
Undiscovery, that was what I was thinking. Stuff I did not buy. I don't know, so there's

608
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,080
going to be a lot of companies that are going to be developing for them, because it's easier

609
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:39,080
to develop on that platform, unless Sony figures out a way to educate these guys a lot faster

610
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,000
and figure out how to develop for a lot easier, you know, that's going to be the problems

611
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,400
they're going to face, and right now, being this far into the console cycle, it's probably

612
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,520
not going to change. So we'll just have to wait for the next round, and we'll see how

613
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,880
it goes there. Alright, well let's keep moving with the news here, because we're running

614
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,040
kind of long tonight, but that's alright, good discussion, right DarkSakura? What else

615
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,640
is new, huh? I know, we're always running long, we're a big fat bloated shell. Hey,

616
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,360
let's talk about some other Xbox 360 releases, but this is actually one for Japan, this is

617
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,360
something that's going to be coming out in Japan. Obviously, Microsoft's had a little

618
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,800
difficulty trying to penetrate the market in Japan, and you know, thanks to some of

619
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,360
these, you know, role playing games that Loki was talking about earlier, they've had a little

620
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,200
bit of luck, but they still have yet to really just break through and be massive over there.

621
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,280
Maybe this will help, because the Japanese love their shmups, shoot em up, shmup. This

622
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,640
one is called Mamoru-kun Has Been Cursed, that would be the English translation of this

623
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:37,720
title. It is coming out on the Xbox 360, it's going to come with a soundtrack CD and a super

624
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,000
play DVD, that's a limited edition that's coming out on the Xbox 360, coming out for

625
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,920
8500 yen, but if you want the regular edition, it's 5980 yen. Now let me tell you a little

626
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,360
bit about this game here, it's been developed by G-Rev, and apparently it does some type

627
00:39:52,360 --> 00:40:00,320
of, it has character designs in it by Mizuki Takayama, he did some other famous shmup games.

628
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,400
This is actually a translation of an arcade game. Looks like you play a little dude, you're

629
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,760
not actually a ship, but it looks like you're actually a little person that's walking around

630
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,560
kind of doing the fighting, so kind of interesting. It's about an elementary school student who

631
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,000
finds themselves in a nightmarish underworld, so it definitely looks kind of cool. The interesting

632
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,620
thing though about these shmups, they don't translate well for widescreen systems, because

633
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,080
you know, shmups are usually very vertical-oriented, you can't really turn your TV on its side,

634
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,080
so you only end up using a very small portion of the screen. You can if you have a really

635
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,240
kick-ass mounting setup. That's true, but people don't usually have that. Well, my husband's

636
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,720
new monitor, the widescreen HDMI, has access to PivotOn, and actually a lot more that you're

637
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,940
finding these days are built to shift position. And I think some of the games, even the Xbox

638
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,840
Live arcade games like Ikaruga I think did support that as well. We have a few Saturn

639
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,880
games that actually will let you do that, I can think Thunderblade, one of the Thunderblade

640
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,880
games will do it. Well, just to give you an idea of some of the other things that G-Rev

641
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,920
has developed, because it's coming out here, they did do some work with Ikaruga and Gradius

642
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,200
5, just so you know. They did some programming and background graphic design for Ikaruga

643
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,920
and same thing for Gradius 5, so they have touched those games, and they've also done

644
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,280
some work with Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker, which is an old school Dreamcast game. So

645
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,320
there you go! This game, a shmup coming out in Japan, no word if it's coming out over

646
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,280
here, although I gotta be honest, probably not. Well, how about we shift gears a little

647
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:35,360
bit? Ah ha ha! Cause it's Gears of War 2 patches! Isn't that fun, Rob? Cool! Well, there's going

648
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,840
to be a premium map pack called Snowblind that's coming out on March 31st, and it'll

649
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:48,400
have three new maps and a remake of Fuel Depot from the first Gears of War, and it's supposed

650
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,880
to bring in experience-based ranking and rebalance the gameplay a bit more, try to give everyone

651
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,120
a better sense of progression, and you'll still be using the true skill system, but

652
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:06,720
it's sort of background now. It's really just something to make people feel more, you know,

653
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,320
rewarded for how well they do. So you can earn your experience in matches that will

654
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:19,400
get you through 100 levels, you get milestones for, you know, each level, I think, each certain

655
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,480
level that you get, so you get an achievement for it, as well as, of course, the packs.

656
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,960
So there's a possibility of getting another 250 gamer score points. There's an auto-balancing

657
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:38,320
feature that will put a bot in place if you fall out during mid-match, although you also

658
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:51,040
get an XP penalty, and it will correct scoring issues. So there's no real price on the map

659
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:59,800
pack yet, but as comparison, the combustible map pack is 800 Microsoft points. So the maps

660
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:07,800
that are coming with this, one's called Grindyard, that's a wintery junkyard processing plant

661
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:15,800
thing. It's supposed to be a spiritual successor to Gridlock. There's Underhill and Courtyard

662
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:23,000
also, in addition to the Fuel Depot remake. Very nice. And ActDeft approves in our chat

663
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,280
room, Fuel Depot was the best map of the first Gears of War, says ActDeft. That's probably

664
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,080
why they're bringing it back. That's probably why it's coming back for another round, absolutely.

665
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,780
We like it! Okay, here. Yay! And of course people are going to be excited that they can

666
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,560
increase their gamer score by another 250 points. Here goes your E-peen! Well, I just

667
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,840
want to say, my E-peen hit a landmark today. Where's your E-peen at? Just today. I crossed

668
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,840
10,000 gamer score today. Woo-hoo! I don't think I'm even nearly there. I think I'm like

669
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,400
under 1,000 still. That's alright, slow and steady wins the race. Took me a few years

670
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,400
to get here. Slow and steady means Jamie's got other stuff to do. Well, you have to play

671
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,600
games with really easy gamer score too, like DDR, like you get an A on a song, you get

672
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,560
50 points, you know things like this. You have entered a shop, champagne! Exactly. So

673
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:16,900
apparently, there's a good use for some of your Xbox 360 systems that may be broken.

674
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,600
One use, of course, would be to convert it into a bong, and that's what someone has done,

675
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,720
actually. They have converted their Xbox 360 system into a bong. Obviously, it doesn't

676
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,960
work anymore, and I'm sure it's been gutted, but yes, now it is a bong, and you can smoke

677
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,280
out of it. Awesome. But, of course, you would only smoke tobacco out of it, right? Of course,

678
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,200
because anything else would be illegal. Because, you know, everybody smokes tobacco out of

679
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:51,560
bongs. Right. Actually, I do know people who actually will do tobacco in a bong, but I

680
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,760
don't do ginseng and other stuff. Is that like a hookah type thing? Yeah, it's pretty

681
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,280
much just a modified hookah, but it's the same difference. But, I'm looking at the picture

682
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:08,560
of it, and I would do better with that. I mean, would you really want to turn your Xbox

683
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,000
360, of all things, into a bong? I'd be calling it the Xbox 420. Well, to be honest, you wouldn't

684
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,320
have to necessarily have an Xbox 360. You could buy a replacement case, and it's like,

685
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,600
just buy a bong. I mean, seriously, it's not even worth, you know, just setting it up.

686
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,040
Class, you get a hookah. It's like, why bother, you know? Why bother other than, oh, look,

687
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,720
I did that. Okay, great. Now one person's converted their system into a bong, no one

688
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,000
else needs to do it, because it's a waste of time. Alright, alright. Am I the only person

689
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,640
here who's reminded of Dennis Leary? How so? Saying that smoking pot doesn't lead to other

690
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,160
drugs, it leads to carpentry? Perhaps. AcidicVampire in chat says, if you use your

691
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:54,080
360 as a bong, you will see Yaris. This is possible. This is very possible. Alright,

692
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,820
look, look. Don't turn your 360 into a bong. Get it to work again so that you can get new

693
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:04,100
games on it. Although this game is not on the 360, but it's a developer that makes a

694
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:11,680
lot of games for 360. PopCap is giving away a free game. That's right, a free game. It's

695
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,480
actually, I believe, going on right now. It's kind of like a St. Patrick's Day promotion.

696
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,440
It's going to go through March 24th. The game you can get is Big Money. You can get the

697
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,400
game for free on PopCap. So go check it out. Big Money, kind of like the game Poppet, if

698
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,480
you've ever played it with the balloons. You're basically trying to make, you know, like four

699
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,200
of the same color that touch, and it has a money theme going to it, yeah. It's just like

700
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,120
the balloon game if you've ever played it, but kind of like, oh no, don't you click them

701
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,120
away in this one. When you see matches of four, you click on it, and then they go away

702
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,680
and everything compresses together. I think that's this one. That's how the balloon one

703
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:56,440
is. So there it is. You click on them, and then it compresses together, and you don't

704
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,640
want it to go past the top of the screen. I've played this before, like a long time

705
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,680
ago, but it's free, so now I can go play it again, unlimited, but I have to get it before

706
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:10,720
the 24th. So check it out. And as Zach Def says in chat, Big Money, Big Money, no whammies,

707
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:17,560
stop! No, it's not that kind of big money, sorry to say. Maybe someday on one of those

708
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,440
live. You need to play your gift. I want to get people over and play the pressure. It'll

709
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,280
be fun. I have the Press Your Luck DVD game. That's what Dark Sakura's talking about. It'll

710
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,160
be fun. Alright. How about some release dates? How about it, Rob? Let's start in the UK with

711
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,600
Dark Sakura. Well, there's really, um, most of them are on the 20th. There is a game being

712
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:43,140
released on the 18th, which is The Path on PC, which I know nothing about. Um, then there's

713
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:48,600
some stuff on the 20th. As I said, there's Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on DS, Mad

714
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:55,600
World on Wii, which is beautiful and completely bloodlicious. There's Ready to Rumble Revolution

715
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:01,520
on Wii, Rhapsody a musical- didn't Rhapsody already come out? I don't know. No, Rhapsody

716
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:10,200
a musical adventure on DS, The Last Remnant on PC, The Wheelman on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation

717
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:17,000
3. And that's it. The US doesn't have much coming out, unfortunately, this week. Starting

718
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,560
things off, of course, we have, um, you know, on the DS, and I think this is held over from

719
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:28,100
last week, but World Championship Games, a track and field event, um, it got delayed

720
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:35,360
to, um, Monday. And that's on the DS, also Valkyrie Profile coming in the plume, also

721
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:41,440
coming out on Monday on the DS. Um, Tuesday is when we have most of the stuff coming out,

722
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:47,520
including, um, another DS game, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Also on the DS, Henry

723
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,720
Hatsworth in a Puzzling Adventure, which is pretty cool, kind of combines puzzle and platforming

724
00:48:52,720 --> 00:49:00,520
there. Um, also on the DS, Mind, Body, and Soul Big World Puzzle Book. Um, on another

725
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:06,720
Nintendo platform, on the Wii, we have Ready the Rumble Revolution, also Provolution Soccer

726
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:17,160
2009 on the Wii as well. Um, also have Rune Factory Frontier, and some more DS titles.

727
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:26,120
We have on the DS and PSP Scrabble, on PlayStation 2, Sing Star Queen, also on the DS, Suicoden

728
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:37,360
T-Crease, um, Trackmania DS, also on the DS, and on the Wii, Crayola Adventures Colorful

729
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:46,360
World. Wow, that sounds awesome. Not. Awesomely bad. Awesomely bad, yes. Um, let's see, this

730
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:52,580
week on Xbox Live Arcade, we're supposed to be getting Hasbro Family Game Night, also

731
00:49:52,580 --> 00:50:02,040
on DS, SBK08, Superbike World Championship. On PC, a few things, The Path, Runes of Magic,

732
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:12,320
Grand Ages Rome, Ether Saga Online, Tom Clancy's Hawks, and Woman's Murder Club, A Darker Shade

733
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:19,320
of Grey, oh, and Men of War. That's it, pretty kind of lame release week, but, oh, and on

734
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:24,480
PSP, how could I forget this, I was actually going to play this, Resistance Retribution.

735
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,520
Can't wait to check out the, like, linking stuff on that. Actually, I can't wait to finish

736
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,640
Resistance 2, since I haven't really played much of that. Hey, quick question for you,

737
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,480
completely random, but since you know about, you know, games that are in demand and all

738
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,840
that stuff, um, what's up with the Retro Game Challenge? I tried to go to Best Buy to get

739
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,880
it the other day, and they said they had none in stock, and they weren't expecting any more.

740
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,760
Is this, is this like a hard to find game now? I guess. It's Atlas, so Atlas puts out

741
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,320
their games in very limited quantities, and a lot of these places, you know, think it's

742
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,820
going to be too niche of a title, and so they don't bring it in. And then people start asking

743
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:01,160
for it, and then you can't find it. Interesting. I know, because I actually was hearing Bobby

744
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,960
say good things about it last week, and he's not the only one, so my other friends are

745
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,420
talking about how they enjoyed Retro Game Challenge, so I was actually going to pick

746
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,360
it up on the DS, and then I can't find it. Oh well. I'll just get it on Amazon or something,

747
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,920
I guess, if I have to. Alright, let's go over to Japanese release dates, and actually also

748
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:22,680
Slow Week in Japan. On the Xbox 360, nothing. On the Playstation 3, MLB 09 The Show is coming

749
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,600
out in other Asian regions, not just Japan. It's kind of making an Asia release, so otherwise

750
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:34,080
as far as Japanese only games, nothing. How about the Nintendo Wii? Now you get some stuff

751
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:40,040
for Japan. Darts Wii Deluxe, Monopoly Here and Now the World Edition, Tiger Woods PGA

752
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,480
Tour 09 All Play, and Winter Sports 2009 The Next Challenge, all of those titles coming

753
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,640
out on the 19th of March. Checking the handhelds out, actually first I want to mention on the

754
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:56,200
Playstation 2, there's a couple price reductions on the games Naraku no Shiro and Sankokushi

755
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:04,080
X get price reductions on the Playstation 2. As far as the Nintendo DS goes, Dengeki

756
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:11,020
Gakuken Cross of Venus RPG is coming out on March 19th, as well as Gardening Mama makes

757
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:17,000
its Japanese debut on March 19th. Are you interested in Gardening Mama, Dark Sakura?

758
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,440
Because I knew you were a big fan of a Cookie Mama. I would rather just cook it and have

759
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:28,240
someone else do my gardening for me. Let's see, also coming out, Kuroshitsuji Phantom

760
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:35,000
and Ghost comes out from Squeenix on the 19th of March, and the Pets series also making

761
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,440
its way to Japan. Cats, Dogs, Horses and Monkeys, those are all separate games making their

762
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,500
release in Japan. Zookeeper gets a price reduction, that game's been out forever. You finally

763
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,800
get that in Japan. Let's take a quick look at the PSP, see if there's anything I want

764
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:56,000
to mention on the PSP. Yeah, Dragon Ball Evolution comes out on the PSP this week in Japan. Yeah,

765
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,600
that's gonna suck. A game based on live action Dragon Ball Z, well, Dragon Ball movie. I

766
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:07,840
don't make them, I just report them. Not gonna see it. You can get PSPs now in bright yellow

767
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,040
and what they call Spirited Green. Those are some new things that are coming out this week

768
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:17,280
as well. Those actually look pretty hot. Are the PSPs region free? Yes. That green one's

769
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:23,080
really good looking actually. I wouldn't mind one of those. They're region free as far as

770
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:29,160
games go, not UMDs. Although, if you put a custom firmware on there, that's not an issue,

771
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:37,560
so. Tempting. Yes. That's it for release dates. So, let's go back into the gaming news, Dark

772
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:44,740
Sakura. Well, you know, Amazon's been having a new deal now with their game downloads where

773
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:54,520
you can basically buy a game to download for $9.99 or less according to their ad. And a

774
00:53:54,520 --> 00:54:00,760
bunch of game developers are not happy about it because they think that their games should

775
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:07,740
be sold for more. So, PopCap and iWin actually pulled a lot of their games off of Amazon

776
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:15,220
saying that it was completely unacceptable. For example, they'd want to put like Jewel

777
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:22,520
Quest for $19.99 and think that $9.99 is way, way too low. That 20 bucks is an acceptable

778
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:28,720
price, 10 bucks is not. So, you can't get those anymore and from what I understand,

779
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:39,040
the rest of the selection is kind of ass. Interesting. Hmm. Oh well. There's a pretty

780
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:49,960
cool update, I guess, possibly in the, I guess, rumored future here for Burnout Paradise.

781
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:56,640
Now you may remember, I think at CES they were showing off a little bit of the 3D technology

782
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,360
you know with those special glasses that you can wear and stuff like that. That can be

783
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,360
used in say different computer games. I believe they're also showing some of the PS3 games

784
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,040
off in it as well like Wipeout HD and stuff like that. Well, one game that may get this

785
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:20,120
upgrade in the future, and this might be something we'll see at GDC, would be Burnout Paradise.

786
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,980
And of course, Burnout Paradise, I mean, I love all the upgrades and updates that they're

787
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:31,600
doing to it. It's really awesome. So, adding 3D to it would be pretty awesome as well.

788
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,120
And if only they could use those polarized glasses that they hand out in the 3D movies

789
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,160
and stuff, because I have a few pairs of those sitting at home. Aren't you supposed to return

790
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,140
those as you leave the theater? You don't have to. The fancy IMAX ones you do. Let me

791
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,780
put it this way. Well, the fancy IMAX ones I can understand because they're like shutter

792
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,340
glasses and stuff like that, but the polarized glasses, they can go fuck themselves because

793
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:56,640
I have to pay for those glasses. I'm keeping that shit, okay? I can understand that. So,

794
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,320
you know, I'm not recycling crap because they're just going to put that back in a package and

795
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:06,400
sell it to me again. No, screw it. Not to say that you can't take the glasses out of

796
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,480
Disneyland either because they have the Honey I Shrunk the Audience or whatever. You can

797
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,600
get the 3D glasses for that. No, they actually have a cast member waiting there for you to

798
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:17,480
dump them off. That's fine. But the Muppet show one's freaking awesome. But I'm saying,

799
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,320
you know, if I have to pay for the glasses, like they're like, oh, the glasses are an

800
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:28,920
extra $5, I'm keeping the glasses. That I can understand. So, all right. Well, I guess

801
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,120
kind of changing topics here a little bit. Talking about this story out of the UK, there's

802
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,960
this campaign called the Change for Life campaign over in the UK. What's interesting about this

803
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,060
is it's trying to, I guess you could say it's a campaign, an ad campaign trying to get folks

804
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:51,520
to not play video games, basically insinuating that video games cause obesity, diabetes,

805
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,440
cancer and so on and so on. Just all these bad things. And basically trying to get people

806
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,660
to go out and about. For instance, let me read the text on one of their ads here. Risk

807
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:06,240
an early death. Do nothing. 9 out of 10 kids risk growing up to have unhealthy amounts

808
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,080
of fat in their bodies. Even if you think they look healthy today, adult could bring

809
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,400
an early death from heart disease, type 2 diabetes or cancer. So make sure your kids

810
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,640
are active for an hour a day. Reduce how much fat they eat. For more advice, visit this

811
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,280
website. And what's interesting about this particular ad that I'm reading from in particular

812
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,560
is it features a little kid sitting on the couch holding a PlayStation controller in

813
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:33,520
their hand. Like, oh, I'm just sitting here lazy looking, you know, half dead. Yeah. Well,

814
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,440
but he definitely looks bored playing PlayStation games, which, you know, there, there are quite

815
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,120
a lot of boring PlayStation 3 games are out right now. However, that's not the problem.

816
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:47,220
What's going on here. Sony's pissed about this. And Sony is to the point where, um,

817
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:52,820
they are actually thinking about possibly filing a lawsuit. Apparently the agency who

818
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:58,880
made the ad, the gate, they did not get permission from Sony to use the controller, uh, in the

819
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:05,680
ad. And so it is possible that they're talking about, uh, uh, possibly Sony Computer Entertainment

820
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,720
Europe is considering legal action against the folks that made the ad.

821
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,040
And here's the thing, you know, yes, kids need to get up off the couch. Kids should

822
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:21,240
not sit and play video games all day. What's there to say that video games aren't actually

823
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:26,280
a healthy thing to incorporate into a lifestyle, you know, just, you know, maybe an hour a

824
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,800
day or a couple hours a week. You know, if you limit it in your kid's life, I don't think

825
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,000
it's necessarily such a bad thing at all. You know, right. Kind of gets them to think

826
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,840
it challenges them, gives them a sense of accomplishment. I think there's a lot of good

827
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,320
things, you know, the old hand-eye coordination riff that we all used growing up. Right. I

828
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,680
do still think though that kids need to go outside and play. Oh, I absolutely don't get

829
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:55,040
me wrong, but come on, look at this ad risk and early death sitting here playing. I'd

830
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,040
be pissed.

831
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,880
I'd be as uninteresting as this kid. They're also though not factoring in the fact that

832
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,440
there are many people who may be clinically overweight who are actually in better health

833
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:12,200
than, like say that you've got the person who's in their BMI range, correct? Right.

834
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:19,280
And they don't eat properly, they don't exercise, they can't lift much, but you've got the person

835
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,240
that maybe you say a little over their BMI, which by the way, BMI is bullshit, you know,

836
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,120
are overweight, but yet they go out and, you know, bike, go swimming, do things, are active

837
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:35,280
people and have much better cardiovascular system than the, you know, stupid little anorexic

838
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:42,320
cheerleader type. I mean, you can also have, you know, someone incredibly muscle bound

839
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:49,360
who's the same BMI as someone 300 pounds overweight. I mean, really, it's, you've got to look at

840
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:56,360
the factors of biology, genetics, and more than that. It's, just sitting in front of

841
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,600
the couch playing video games all day is not going to make you die.

842
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,520
Comments from chat. I have to read chat.orangelaundryradio.com. Xlink says, it's good hand-eye, but so is

843
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,360
masturbation. Good point.

844
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:11,640
SHJ100Matt says, go outside and play Dragon's Lair in the backyard. Xbandit says, you can

845
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,360
be fat and happy. It's true, you can be fat and happy, but you know, you just got to make

846
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,560
sure you're not fat and unhealthy. There's, there's the difference.

847
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:25,460
You know, so you can be a triathlete and, you know, or let's see, you can be a professional

848
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:33,840
bicyclist and get cancer. True. True. You can be a triathlete who gets hit by a car.

849
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,480
You know, what does it matter? Then you die an ironic death. Here's the thing is that

850
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,100
I think a better ad might be instead of the big text up there that says risk an early

851
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:50,440
death, do just nothing. How about one that says stop using games to babysit your children?

852
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,520
That would be an effective ad in my opinion. That, that would be one because the kid looks

853
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:59,280
bored and everything. So how about stop using games to babysit your children?

854
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:06,880
A responsible parent is going to look beyond, you know, there, and this is something that

855
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,280
I've had to think of a lot myself lately. If you're going to be a responsible parent,

856
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:19,640
you need to be 100% for your kid, including taking them outside to get them some activity,

857
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,880
including telling them, you know, I think you've played enough. You need to go do this

858
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,560
now. You've got to set, you know, the, uh, you have to do the things that are good for

859
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,880
them, not just the things that are convenient for you.

860
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,840
That's an awfully nice way to phrase it as a parent is that, you know, I think you've

861
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:40,760
played enough cause I know my mom would have said, turn it off and go outside.

862
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,320
Well, you know what I mean?

863
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,080
No, I know what you mean.

864
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:49,480
My mom would be just like, you're not on that thing again, are you? And then I'd go out

865
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,320
and play, come back and she'd be playing my Nintendo.

866
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:59,000
Nice. That's how she got her turn. Go outside. It's my turn.

867
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,440
That's pretty much it.

868
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,840
All right, so we'll see what happens. We'll see if Sony does end up suing over this or

869
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,680
not. I'm not sure what's going to end up happening.

870
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,680
You know who else will sue?

871
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,680
Who?

872
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:15,480
They won't, but speaking of Sony, we have some stuff about nobi nobi boy, um, Takahashi

873
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:22,720
Keita said that there's going to be an offline multiplayer mode on the way and that he wants

874
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:29,000
people to enjoy the game. So they're working on an update. Um, there's, uh, it's, it's

875
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,820
all going to be though offline though, specifically offline and, um, they're saying that it should

876
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,720
be roughly around the 18th of April.

877
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,000
Well, I mean, not boo. I mean, multiplayer is better than none at all, but you know,

878
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,960
I wish, you know, it's not like the Sony's not connected to the internet, you know?

879
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,660
I know, right?

880
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,660
So whatever.

881
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:55,500
Hmm. I don't know. I played that, like I said today, and I still don't get the game.

882
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,960
I have yet to check it out. I keep forgetting. And every time I do go on the PlayStation

883
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,760
to play, I'm going back to Flower.

884
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,680
I hate the camera so bad in the game.

885
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,480
The Sony camera? Oh, for Flower?

886
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:14,720
No, in No We Know You. The camera is a pain in the ass. And whatever. Um, so, it's interesting.

887
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:19,160
Um, of course, a lot of people are familiar with GamePro, the magazine. Um, it's still

888
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:24,420
around, surprisingly. Um, well, GamePro is actually going to publish indie games now

889
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:29,300
under their new label, GamePro Labs. And, uh, you may see some of these games coming

890
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:38,040
to XNA, PC, Zune, iPhone, etc. Um, basically, they're going to sort of act as a middleman

891
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,520
between indie devs and platform holders.

892
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,640
Um, what's also interesting is GamePro is going to announce that they're planning to

893
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:51,060
produce a free custom edition of its magazine for distribution exclusively at 7-Eleven.

894
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:59,100
So when you get your Slurpee, you can get a free copy of your modified GamePro magazine.

895
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,780
Is this going to be in addition to their print- the current subscription magazine?

896
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:06,100
Yes, and also, I'd like to add growing in this economy.

897
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:11,620
I'd like to add as a further dip at, um, the crap that is 7-Eleven. You can go pick up

898
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:16,460
your free magazine when you're picking up a game that's broken the street again, you

899
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,860
know, because 7-Eleven doesn't-

900
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,500
You make it sound like it's an issue.

901
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:24,560
7-Eleven doesn't hear street dates, nor do I.

902
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:29,020
I know, what's the problem? I thought you were in full support of this.

903
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:33,260
I'm in full support of Slurpees, and if- God damn it, if I became rich, I'm getting a

904
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,260
Slurpee machine.

905
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:37,940
I miss vanilla Coke Slurpees. Those were the bomb. What the hell do I have to do to get

906
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,860
those to come back?

907
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,780
GamePro doing their own game publishing. Do you think we're going to see anything big

908
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,780
come out of this?

909
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,780
Nope.

910
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,400
Or do you think it's just going to be of the caliber of the types of things that come free

911
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,140
with the magazine?

912
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:55,260
You know, that would be kind of interesting to have exclusive games for the magazine,

913
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,260
you know, just indie developers.

914
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,220
I know, I'm surprised these Xbox magazines aren't giving away some of these community

915
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:03,360
games on their discs.

916
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:08,740
That's because they have to give away demos that are already available on Live. Woo! Demos!

917
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,740
I can't download-

918
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,740
For those three people that are connected to the internet.

919
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:16,140
See, here's the thing. I used to subscribe to Xbox Magazine back when they used to have

920
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:20,180
demos, way before they ever came out, you know, like Saints Row, because that was awesome.

921
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:27,220
Saints Row demo, hell yeah, but now it's like demos for old shit that have been out on Live

922
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,780
for a long time now.

923
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:32,300
Yeah, no thanks, I don't need to subscribe to your magazine anymore. I already get a

924
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:38,780
free membership to stupid, well not even technically free, but I get a membership to Game Informer

925
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,980
because I have that stupid card at GameStop because, you know, it gives me an extra 10%

926
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:43,980
or whatever.

927
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:47,820
Who cares? It's paid for itself, but hey, I get a magazine out of it, and actually the

928
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:51,700
magazine's not bad, so I'm not buying Xbox Magazine.

929
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:56,780
Well, if you've ever wanted to make your own iPhone game, as a lot of people have been

930
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,900
lately, I think the iPhone passed some obscene amount of applications that are now available

931
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,660
in the store, like 10,000 apps or something are now available in the store.

932
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,940
How many of them are good?

933
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:09,620
Probably 10. But anyhow, here's the thing, is that now any idiot's going to be able to

934
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:15,980
make their own iPhone game. It's a game called GameSalad. Yes, that's right, it's GameSalad,

935
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:20,020
it's this new software that's coming out from Gendai Games. It's going to be something that

936
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,900
will help you develop your own iPhone games.

937
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,700
Apparently though, it's not just going to stop there. I guess in the future, what have

938
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:31,540
you, it's going to be open to Facebook, and then possibly the Wii and the DS someday.

939
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:35,440
So yeah, GameSalad is coming out of this, I guess they were showing more about this

940
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:40,020
at the South by Southwest festival that's going on right now this weekend. Kind of interesting,

941
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:43,180
you make your own little 2D games, these screenshots I'm looking at, somebody's putting together

942
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,420
their own little shooter game. I don't know though, is this just going to be the quality

943
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:49,340
of RPG Maker, or what? I don't know.

944
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:55,700
Don't knock RPG Maker, it's still pretty good actually. But no, it's not going to be any

945
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:02,160
good at all. I mean, RPG Maker's pretty awesome, but I've seen some of these games, like how

946
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:08,500
like Click and Play, there's just so many limitations to it, and I don't know, I think

947
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,500
it's just-

948
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,040
Well, here's the thing though, it's not just for shooters, like some of the games they

949
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,420
say have been made on this that are pretty good. A game called Darkwood that's like a

950
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:23,660
Zelda-ish type of RPG that was made by 3 students in a week's time, and then DRFT, a 2D racing

951
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,780
game that's kind of like the original Grand Theft Auto.

952
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:29,460
Yeah, it sounds like everything that Click and Play could have done, because that's the

953
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:34,000
type of stuff you could do in it, and it's just very limited, and yeah, you can make

954
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,620
these wonderful little racing games and stuff, but they're just not great. And I hope to

955
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:43,140
God that you can't publish these on the Apple Store, because that's all they want. Let's

956
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:47,340
put out a game-making program so any idiot can create all this crap and then we can pad

957
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:52,540
our numbers on the App Store and use that in our next commercial that, you know-

958
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:57,060
Why not? Any idiot can make a podcast and get it listed on the iTunes Store. Hey, how

959
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,060
you doing?

960
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:04,340
Yeah, but iTunes doesn't go, hey, we've got X million podcasts, look at us, we're so awesome.

961
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,300
They don't really care.

962
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,660
Apple doesn't care about podcasts?

963
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:15,460
Apple doesn't care about a lot of things except getting you to buy their crappy products.

964
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:20,380
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news. We're almost to the end of part A of

965
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,620
the Classic Game of the Week, coming up in just a little bit, we've got a couple more

966
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,020
stories for you guys.

967
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:31,580
That we do. In fact, something about Resident Evil 5. There's supposed to be a versus download

968
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:44,340
content and it's supposed to be out for 160 Microsoft points or 250 yen on a Playstation

969
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:50,260
network, which we're probably going to be getting it for twice as much or something

970
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:57,980
like that, but they're basically saying in Japan it's going to be out March 26th, so.

971
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:06,220
Very cool. So there's, of course, we were talking a little bit earlier about exclusives

972
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:12,260
and that kind of stuff and mentioned Bioshock 2. Well, of course, this month in Game Informer,

973
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:18,300
which also goes back to another story, man, we're transitioning from two different stories.

974
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:26,020
Bioshock 2 was the cover story and, of course, they showed, or revealed, I should say, the

975
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:34,100
Big Sister is a new Big Daddy-esque creature that you're going to be fighting against in

976
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:39,340
the game. Now, there are no real details, at least, that have leaked out yet about what

977
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:45,700
exactly you're going to be doing, but the second game, apparently, you will be playing

978
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:51,660
as the first Big Daddy, the original. They'll be kind of a renegade Big Daddy that's actually

979
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:57,900
on the hunt for his own little sister and that you'll be able to take out rival daddies

980
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:03,620
with your hand drill. Plasmid powers, apparently, are going to be making a return as well as

981
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:10,380
some other interesting things. And, apparently, this little sister is looking to kidnap your

982
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:16,500
little sisters as well. And it's very interesting, but, of course, it's going to be an awesome

983
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:27,900
game. Bioshock 1 was really sweet and I can't see that it's going to be any less than that.

984
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,300
This game has an awful lot to live up to. Do you think it's going to meet the hype?

985
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,220
I think it will. I think they're going to have to do some interesting stuff with it.

986
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:37,740
I thought that it was going to be more above ground and stuff like that. The fact that

987
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:43,420
you're playing as a Big Daddy from the beginning is kind of ehhh. I'm not too sure if I like

988
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:52,460
that idea, but we'll see. Alright, well, hey, let's take a trip back to the past here. I'm

989
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:55,740
not talking about the Classic Game of the Week just yet, but here's the interesting

990
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:59,940
thing is that the Genesis, of course, is a system that's been featured many times in

991
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:06,100
the Classic Game of the Week. Apparently, there is this new kind of like third party

992
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:11,860
Sega Genesis coming out here. Blaze is the company that is producing this. I guess it's

993
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:15,780
kind of like a knockoff of the Genesis that came out kind of later. They're calling it

994
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,500
the Mega Drive because I don't think they're actually releasing it here. It's something

995
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:25,700
that is being sold at Play in Britain. It's going for about $53 and with the system comes

996
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:32,240
about 15 games. Sonic and Knuckles, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd, Golden Axe. So all these

997
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:36,960
old school games. And I guess what you start to see is as these consoles age, I guess the

998
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,180
patents expire or something like that. And now third party remake these old ass consoles,

999
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:45,700
which is interesting. And the best part about this though, because they did release something

1000
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,780
before they've done handhelds and that kind of thing. The best part about this though

1001
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:54,740
is it does have its own cartridge slot that will play Mega Drive and Genesis games. So

1002
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:58,660
not only do you have the 15 that are built in, but you can put in new ones. Yeah. Very

1003
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:04,680
cool. Very cool. Alright, well, now what we're going to do, we're going to take a trip back

1004
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:08,420
to the past and I don't know if Dark Soccer has picked a Genesis game this week. She might

1005
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:13,820
have picked something else. Not a while. Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane and see

1006
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:18,460
what the classic game of the week is that all you kids should check out this week by

1007
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:27,460
Dark Soccer. Well, the secret, the secret. The game of the week is Secret of Mana, which

1008
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:35,900
was known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2. And I picked music for it that is actually some

1009
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:46,900
of the overworld music, which is my favorite. Well, I thought it was going to be a little

1010
01:12:46,900 --> 01:13:03,460
different. The game came out, it was actually developed by Square, which is now Squeenix,

1011
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:11,180
and came out on the Super Nintendo and we eventually got it on Virtual Console. It's

1012
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:16,420
actually, as I said, Seiken Densetsu 2. The first one was called Seiken Densetsu Final

1013
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:25,180
Fantasy Gaiden for the Game Boy, and we got it as Final Fantasy Adventure. It was kind

1014
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:31,060
of an interesting little game there, but going back to Secret of Mana, it didn't use the

1015
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:39,220
turn based system, it used a real time battle, more like how it was in Zelda, but you also

1016
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:47,700
had an AI that you could actually control to be either attacking, defense, or somewhere

1017
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:53,660
in the middle, and a second player could come in and play one of your other characters.

1018
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:59,820
So it was pretty much a two player RPG. I personally have not tried to do it with the

1019
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:05,300
multitap to see if you can do three people, so if anyone has let me know. It just never

1020
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:18,740
occurred to me until I was an adult. So the game itself, in the American version, is basically,

1021
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:24,060
you're kicked out of town and you have to go and you hook up with a princess and a sprite

1022
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:31,320
and you run around trying to get a different, well first of all you get your experience

1023
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:39,420
in battle and you level up and you can level up your spells as you, you know, as you attract

1024
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:44,140
them. And by the way, the multitap does work. Thought I would mention that. And the virtual

1025
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:49,800
console version will let you use three people. But anyway, you have to rescue different elementals

1026
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:57,780
and they give you different attacks, different skills, different things that you can do.

1027
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:08,620
But the magic is your party's mana power which will increase as the game goes on. So, really

1028
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:15,020
it's just you go through different places. You can also get Flammie. You remember Flammie?

1029
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:18,940
Yes. The second thing I put on there, Rob, was

1030
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:22,260
Flammie's music. Let me queue that up here real quick.

1031
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:36,580
The best way I can describe Flammie is like Falcor from The Never Ending Story, really.

1032
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:41,940
It's the same concept. You ride on this big white dragon thingy's back and then you can

1033
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:52,300
land in different places. But hey, it's mode seven-tastic. So you can go over the background

1034
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:57,900
and you can move and the map will move with you and you can land and it's pretty cool.

1035
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:02,580
So it's just a cool little game. I think it's funny though, the way that you call them is

1036
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:09,860
by doing the little drum with the balls on the string. I forgot what they're called.

1037
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:19,620
But anyway, it's super cool. But at the end you get the mana sword and kick ass and game

1038
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:35,300
over. So the game was designed by Ishikoichi and was actually released after Final Fantasy

1039
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:44,500
3. They wanted to actually use the system from Final Fantasy 4, but it wouldn't work

1040
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:49,180
in the series, so they did it all for Secret of Mana. It was originally going to be an

1041
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:55,740
SNES CD add-on, but when they dropped that they just did it all to fit on the cartridge.

1042
01:16:55,740 --> 01:17:04,660
I actually had one of the faster localization. It only took 30 days to translate the game.

1043
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:15,580
And we got it. It was also stated that they were going to bring it out for the Wonderswan

1044
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:29,580
Color and they cancelled it when Square decided to tell Bondi WTF, we don't like you anymore.

1045
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:35,780
So that's really it. It's been one of the most popular games. It's been considered by

1046
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:42,540
Nintendo Power it was number 42 in their top 200 games of all time. And it's one of my

1047
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:47,500
favorites. And it's actually because of this that I went nuts trying to find Saikens and

1048
01:17:47,500 --> 01:18:00,220
Senzu 3 and played the most of it on a fully translated bomb hack. I wish I could find it.

1049
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,220
It's a very worthwhile game. If you haven't played it, play the hell out of it and then

1050
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:11,180
play Saikens and Senzu 3 because it just evolves all the awesome. So go for it. I don't even

1051
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,580
know why I hadn't reviewed this earlier.

1052
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:17,980
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Secret of Mana. And what a classic

1053
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:22,100
game it is. I wonder if they'll ever be highlighting Secret of Evermore.

1054
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:28,060
Well, ow, sorry. You know what gave me the idea to do that, Rob? I found my game.

1055
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,060
What's that?

1056
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:30,060
Secret of Mana.

1057
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,060
Oh, did you?

1058
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,060
In the box.

1059
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,060
Ah.

1060
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:36,940
With the instruction manual and everything. And then I was just thinking, damn. It's a

1061
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,500
shame that I'm so attached to this thing.

1062
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:40,500
Nice.

1063
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,940
That would pay for my Disneyland.

1064
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:47,100
Right, right. Alright, well we are going to take a break here. We've got plenty more Orange

1065
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,740
Lounge Radio coming up, though, in Orange Lounge Radio Part B. So stay tuned. Don't

1066
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:58,940
go anywhere. We will be right back.

1067
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:02,740
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March

1068
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:10,140
15th of 2009, where we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night on AllGames.com. All Games

1069
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:14,300
Radio, bringing you lots and lots of great gaming shows throughout the week. We're on

1070
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:17,620
right after another great gaming show called The Bobby Black Wolf Show, and we run for

1071
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:22,700
about three hours, until we're tired and we want to go home, is basically how long we

1072
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,900
do the show.

1073
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:27,060
We have plenty more gaming news to get to in this segment. First, though, I want to

1074
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:30,460
kind of give a plug for this. You might remember a few weeks ago, actually it was a couple

1075
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:36,780
months ago now at this point, we had Aaron from the Snake 360 development team, or he

1076
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:42,100
is the Snake 360 development team, really, all by his little self, was here on the show

1077
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:46,100
to talk about his community game, Snake 360. Well, I just got word that now apparently

1078
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:53,680
there is a new game called Snake 360 Lite on Xbox Live Marketplace, and it's the same

1079
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:58,420
game as pretty much what was up there before, except now it's half the price. Now, of course,

1080
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,740
since it is half the price, there's a little less features than what you have in the full

1081
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:07,660
game, but now I guess you get some two different multiplayer modes now, three single player

1082
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:13,420
courses, three difficulty levels, multiples of control schemes, just like in the other

1083
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:17,420
game, you still get some of the soundtrack from the same recording, and so on and so

1084
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:22,620
on. So, pretty cool, check that out, support independent game development, Snake 360 Lite.

1085
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:26,460
Alright, now we're going to get back into some other gaming news, yes, Loki?

1086
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:34,580
Yes, we are. Some pretty cool stuff, I don't know, this is kind of weird. Nintendo has

1087
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:40,700
addressed complaints that they had not that many games coming out, they're low output

1088
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:46,660
of first party titles. Apparently, it says this year, Nintendo seems to be getting some

1089
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:54,700
more games coming out, including the equally awaited Punch Out. Of course, they've been

1090
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:58,380
having the new play control games and stuff like that, but it says until now, there have

1091
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:03,420
been complaints that Nintendo actually makes too many games, or Nintendo dictates too much

1092
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:08,940
leadership. I think they're talking about publishers complaining that their games, the

1093
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:13,260
first party games seem to be so successful, it's actually overshadowing the third party

1094
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:18,300
games, and then also it says that there's also people complaining that Nintendo makes

1095
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:25,260
far too few games. And they're like, well, we don't know what to do. So now that they're

1096
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,820
putting out more games, they're trying to make sure people are going to be happy. The

1097
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:35,020
thing though, you ask me, they're not really putting out that many new games. I mean, porting

1098
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:40,540
over a game that was on the GameCube that they had sitting in a shelf for quite a long

1099
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:47,540
time, some of the Mario Tennis and the Pikmin games and the new Donkey Kong, was it Jungle

1100
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:51,900
Beat and that kind of stuff. Those aren't new games. You're just adding stuff to it

1101
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:57,020
and you're adding new controls to it. I mean, really, that does not count. Putting old things

1102
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:02,860
in new packaging. That doesn't count at all. Excite Bots and Punch Out, that does count

1103
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:07,420
because those are brand new. But these new play control games, I'm sorry, I'm getting

1104
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:11,740
a little sick of them. And they've just started coming out, but just tell people to stop buying

1105
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:16,460
them. But the thing is, that's all that's coming out now. It's like, people are so hungry

1106
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:20,860
for Nintendo games, like, oh god, I want a new Pikmin game. Well, now you're going to

1107
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:26,140
buy the re-release of Pikmin 1 and 2. I mean, that's fine if you want to play them or if

1108
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:31,180
you haven't played them before, but it's kind of encouraging them not to put any effort

1109
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:35,100
into it. It's just like, I don't know if you remember back on the Game Boy Advance, when

1110
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:40,940
they started porting NES games to it. You know, that was cool, but at the same time,

1111
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:48,660
it's like, let's make something new now. Anytime now. GameGuru in our chatroom says Punch Out

1112
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:55,180
is very much a remake. It is, but it is adding new characters, and it's not so much, it may

1113
01:22:55,180 --> 01:23:00,080
be a remake, but it's not a port. It's a Super Nintendo game too, and it's at least kind

1114
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:04,020
of redone from the ground up, and there are some new things in it. And it's not a port.

1115
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:08,500
It's not like, oh, I took the GameCube game, didn't really change anything to it, and then

1116
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:14,380
just poured it over. Now, Pikmin 1 and Mario Power Tennis, they didn't really add anything

1117
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:18,860
to it. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, from what I hear, they're adding some additional levels

1118
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,420
to it. I don't know if it was in the Japanese version or if these are brand new levels,

1119
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:26,020
but they're adding something to it. And then Pikmin 2 are supposed to have two different

1120
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:30,140
types of Pikmin that weren't originally in the game. So they are adding something to

1121
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:38,820
it. But still, it's a port of a game that's been out for a long time now. GS68 in chat

1122
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:44,660
asks, where's my new play control Custer's Revenge? That wasn't on the GameCube. It wasn't,

1123
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:48,700
but maybe it's a game that he's thinking needs to make a comeback, I don't know. Alright,

1124
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:53,180
well look, if you want to look for some new Wii games that actually look kind of interesting,

1125
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:56,700
and you want to talk about a remake, I don't know if this is really a remake though. This

1126
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:01,060
is like a reinvention completely of the old game Pong. I'm going to actually play a little

1127
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:06,060
clip here from the little trailer that we have here in studio, because this actually

1128
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:15,380
looks kind of neat. Let me see if I can play a little clip here. It's like a music-based

1129
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:23,900
game. It's called Bit.Trip.Beat, and it's by a company called Axis. And it's actually

1130
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:28,380
coming out to WiiWare on Monday, and it's like, all these little Pong balls consistently

1131
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:31,740
are coming at your little paddle, and you have to bounce them back. And when you do,

1132
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:37,340
it makes little beat music, like the 8-bit weapon type of chiptunes music, that's what

1133
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:41,340
I was looking for. I guess this game's coming out, it's going to be 600 points. Here's the

1134
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:44,860
thing, the controls, you just tilt the control back and forth, tilt the little Wiimote back

1135
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:48,800
and forth to make the little paddle go up and down the screen. And the graphics, they're

1136
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:55,300
not even 8-bit, they're like Atari 2600, but with these really trippy New Age backgrounds.

1137
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:59,260
So it looks kind of neat. I'm actually thinking I have to play this. This should be on the

1138
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:04,540
DS. No, I like the idea of only having to pay $6 for this. But this should be on the

1139
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:10,220
DS. Who knows, maybe if this does well, it will be. But like, this boss stage looks just

1140
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:16,100
like a freakin' regular Breakout or something like that, it's crazy. Trippy. Very trippy.

1141
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:20,980
Hence the name, haha. Exactly, so you can check that out, it'll be out on WiiWare on

1142
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:25,140
Monday it sounds like. By the time most of you hear this podcast, it'll already be out.

1143
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:32,140
ActDeft in chat says, BitTripBeat is basically Pong and Rez's bastard child. Kinda. Kinda.

1144
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:42,260
Well, I have bad, bad news. Actually, not really bad news. Hmm, what's that? It's not

1145
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:50,620
likely news, but Capcom US is hoping that we get a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which I think

1146
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:59,300
would be freakin' fantastic. And I mean, it's got Gatchamon. What else do you need, right?

1147
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:04,460
They're saying, it was basically a quote by Christian Svensson, who is the developer,

1148
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:09,180
the business developer and strategic planning VP at Capcom, said, do not rule out, do not

1149
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:13,300
rule a Western release out. That's all I can say right now. We are still actively working

1150
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:17,300
on having that happening. I can't say it's happening definitely. I couldn't give you

1151
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:21,580
a time, but as badly as the fans want it, we want to bring it. The problem that they're

1152
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:30,900
running into is, what do we all say, licensing. Right? Mm-hmm. Tatsunoko rights are actually

1153
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:37,380
split among several companies in the US, whereas of course in Japan, Tatsunoko Pro has all

1154
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:44,300
of them. You don't have to worry about it. But here, it's like, you know, whoever had,

1155
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:49,340
you know, Gatchamon 2 has Eagle Riders here. You know, there was Battle of the Planets,

1156
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:57,500
there was G-Force, you know, for all the Gatchamon franchises. I don't know if we ever got Tekkaban

1157
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:03,540
on TV here at all. Some anime companies got the rights to Kachan. Yeah, we had it as it

1158
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:09,180
was Technoman over here. But just all those different characters, the ones that were either

1159
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:15,580
converted to, you know, tunes that we watched as a kid or in later anime, you know, home

1160
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:21,060
releases, you know, different things like that. Or even, you know, people who just thought

1161
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:26,580
about bringing it out over here and paid the licensing rights. That does happen. It's gonna

1162
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:32,700
be a pain to get everything together, so they're actually gonna have to do a lot of work for

1163
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:39,820
us to get the game over here, and it's all down to freakin' licensing. Well, that's not

1164
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:43,020
a surprise, but kinda, you know, I think we all, at least I accepted the fact that we

1165
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,400
probably weren't gonna be getting this game quite some time ago. You know, I wouldn't

1166
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:51,480
expect to see this game over here because of the licensing, which is just a darn shame

1167
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:55,400
because the game's a lot of fun. You almost just kinda wish, you know, if the Japanese

1168
01:27:55,400 --> 01:28:00,340
companies created them, they just would release it out here and say, fuck all y'all. These

1169
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:04,900
were originally our characters, so I forget it. But I guess, sadly, in a sue-happy world,

1170
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:10,100
that's not what can be done. Well, the way that it is is that once Tatsunoko's given

1171
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:15,100
up the rights, they have to abide by contract. Yeah, no, I get it. It just sucks. And Tatsunoko

1172
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:21,140
Pro I don't think really has any holdings in the US, so it'd be nice. So then they couldn't

1173
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:25,500
be sued in a US court. But I guess Capcom could be. But Tatsunoko wouldn't legally be

1174
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:30,300
able to give the approval, which they clearly did in Japan, they just would not legally

1175
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:34,700
be able to do approval in the United States. No, I know, I get it. It just sucks. That's

1176
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:40,600
all. It just sucks. Hmm. So. It's still pretty cool though that might have a chance to actually

1177
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:45,240
come out over here. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't bet money on it. Here's what I would

1178
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:49,220
bet. If anything, they would just use the engine for something else. You know, like

1179
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:55,380
port, new maybe Capcom vs Street Fighter game. That'd be kinda cool, you know, with some

1180
01:28:55,380 --> 01:29:01,100
new Capcom characters in there and stuff. You know, get a, what's his name, Frank West

1181
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:07,140
from Dead Rising in there and stuff as a character. Sadly, I'm not gonna hold my breath. They'd

1182
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:12,740
need Gatchaman Fighter. Always. Just Gatchaman. Whatever. And they'd need to make it, for

1183
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:18,060
me specifically, and say, because Jamie demanded it, we give you- And it would actually say

1184
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:25,820
that in the opening credits. Exactly. We give you Gatchaman the battle. Okay. I would be

1185
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:32,580
very gratified as a fangirl. And then you wake up. Yeah, not gonna happen. What is gonna

1186
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:39,220
happen though are three more Wii games in the Resident Evil series, including the, it's

1187
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:44,940
never gonna be released in the United States, Resident Evil 0, which now is gonna be released

1188
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:50,180
in the United States, and of course already out in Japan. However, a new game that will

1189
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:55,380
be coming out, Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles, which will be a sequel to the Umbrella Chronicles

1190
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:00,660
game. It's gonna be a rail shooter, and is based on the Resident Evil 2 timeline starring

1191
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:07,300
Leon and Claire. They're gonna add, I guess, some new co-op stuff and a new evade system,

1192
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:12,100
which is supposed to be pretty cool. Then they're also gonna do a Resident Evil remake

1193
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:19,340
that's gonna be coming out as well, titled, I guess, Resident Evil Classics. And, not

1194
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:24,100
sure if that's gonna be kinda like a new play control game or something like that, but that's

1195
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:39,740
gonna be, I guess, coming out for a $30 price point. The studio is haunted. We're having

1196
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:52,100
the attack of the random beeping noise. Here, just give that to me. I'll turn that off.

1197
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:57,220
Live radio, everybody. It's my sensor bar. Batteries are going out. Sorry about that,

1198
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:00,660
guys. It's warning you that it's turning off. We had random beeping going on in the studio,

1199
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:03,980
and it was from the Wii that Loki was playing during the breaks there, showing Madworld

1200
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:08,420
on Justintv. The wireless bar was beeping. That was crazy. I think the timer, I had set

1201
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:14,780
it to a two-hour timer, so I think it was turning off. Okay, sorry about the crazy dead

1202
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:21,460
air there, but live radio, that happens. Yeah, so I'm sorry. Resident Evil rail shooter is

1203
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:25,860
coming out. And it makes me think about, you know, Silent Hill had a rail shooter that

1204
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:29,100
hit arcades and what have you, so it's like all these scary games are getting shooters.

1205
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:32,660
You know what scary thing I wanna see get turned into a shooter, though? Hot girls in

1206
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:37,740
scary places. Have you seen this show on E? I thought you were gonna say showgirls. No.

1207
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:41,940
That is scary in itself, but have you seen this on E? It's a show on E, and they put

1208
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:45,220
hot girls and they put them in scary places, and they have to spend the night in abandoned

1209
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:49,740
hospitals and stuff. What, like, you know, next to nerdy guys or something? No, they

1210
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:52,780
have to do all these gross tasks and they get money and stuff like that, you know, if

1211
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:57,040
they're able to actually... Hot girls in scary places, yes. That's the game they need that's

1212
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:03,700
a rail shooter of a completely different kind. Alright. Anyhow, forget it. Moving on. More

1213
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,700
news on Excitebots. It seems like every week we have new news on Excitebots, but here's

1214
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:14,160
the interesting thing about Excitebots. Apparently now the blogs are reporting that Super Sandwich

1215
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:18,740
is a move that you can have in the game, and that's from this giant screenshot coming from

1216
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:24,180
the game there. Super Sandwich, five stars. It's basically, what they've done is they've

1217
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:28,500
have a bunch of different things that are going on during the races, like, you know,

1218
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,660
you'll have to collect parts of a sandwich and then when you collect them you have Super

1219
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,500
Sandwich. You know, it was funny, remember? I don't know if you remember when Christopher

1220
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:39,420
used to, like, kind of sing the different, like, achievements that he got in there. He

1221
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,980
was like, Super Tree Run! So that's what I pictured when I saw that. I was, like, picturing

1222
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:48,340
him singing Super Sandwich. Nice. Which would be funny. Sadly you will not be having an

1223
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:53,220
actual sandwich, which is most unfortunate if you ask me. The game looks crazy and Nelly

1224
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:58,300
keeps asking me why it's coming out, so. And we don't know, right? Or is it... Uh, 20.

1225
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:05,300
22nd or 20th of April? Yeah. Oh. Alright. Not too far out. Not too far out. Hey, it's

1226
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:10,780
in time for a birthday present. For me! It's always got to be about you now, doesn't it?

1227
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:19,780
Yes, it always must be about me. I have to have the show's ego after all. Anyway, um,

1228
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:32,260
how about something related to Namco, maybe? Okay. Well, Namco is actually registered Excalibur

1229
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:40,860
as a trademark. They're not really saying much about it, but it actually has an ESRB

1230
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:49,820
listing some achievements revealed. The, like I said, the registered trademark. And so it's

1231
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:56,780
there. Namco Bandai is releasing Excalibur. So, of course the theory is that, you know,

1232
01:33:56,780 --> 01:34:04,300
it's about King Arthur, but maybe it's another in the Soulcalibur family? Or maybe a fighting

1233
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:16,100
game using the same engine? Or a remake of that old game Excalibur 2555 AD? I have a

1234
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:22,300
feeling that whatever it is, it's going to be lame and disappointing. It's going to be

1235
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:26,860
about Pac-Man! Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. No, that's Namco for you. It's either going

1236
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:32,700
to be really awesome or really lame. And it's usually nothing in between, so. I'm voting

1237
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:38,460
really lame. I don't know. Without a screenshot, nothing? I mean, this could be anything. It

1238
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:45,180
could be a role-playing game. Who knows? Nothing. It sounds a little bit like Soulcalibur, but

1239
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:50,340
you know, Excalibur is also an old, you know, legend and all that stuff. It may have nothing

1240
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:56,020
to do with Soulcalibur. Excalibur is the storyline based on fighters that have dropped out of

1241
01:34:56,020 --> 01:35:01,620
the Soulcalibur series and now have to find real daytime jobs, including working faster

1242
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:10,740
at restaurants. I get it. Excalibur. Ha ha. You're funny. What a fun guy. Ha ha ha. Or,

1243
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:17,900
or it's a fighting game featuring all the exes in the relationship. Alright, I think

1244
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:24,340
now's a good time to just go to the next story. I'll stop now. We do know what this game is

1245
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:29,620
though. We Rock Drum King. It's a brand new drumming game for the Wii. Of course, not

1246
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:34,220
using any actual peripherals other than the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, or possibly two remotes

1247
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:39,060
if you have those. What it does have though is a pretty cool song list. And the track

1248
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:46,140
list was revealed this week, including some stuff that you would not normally see in a

1249
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:51,940
music game like this. Now of course you've got classic rock songs like We Will Rock You

1250
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:57,420
by Queen, The Final Countdown by Europe. You've got some kind of alternative stuff,

1251
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:03,100
Song 2 by Blur. Then some other stuff that they've thrown in there as well. Feel Good

1252
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:12,040
Ink by Gorillaz. But one of the weird ones though that was in there, they had Organ Donor,

1253
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:16,360
the instrumental version by DJ Shadow. You normally wouldn't see that kind of in like

1254
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:21,980
a rock game like this. Some other songs that are in there as well. They have All Star by

1255
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:30,540
Smash Mouth. No One Knows by the Queens of the Stone Age. The Takeover, The Break's Over

1256
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:39,900
by Fall Out Boy. Can't Stand Losing You by the Police. Spoon Man by Soundgarden. And

1257
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:50,260
Click Click Boom by Saliva, as featured in numerous movie trailers. You know, I was still

1258
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:53,600
tempted to get Rock Revolution this week. It's only 20 bucks. There's tons of them sitting

1259
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,660
on the shelf. I'm almost thinking it's going to drop to $9.99 before too long. It won't

1260
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:04,380
drop officially to $9.99, but just let's sit there and fester a while and it's eventually

1261
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:11,140
going to drop down. So bad, they actually cancelled the Wii version. Ouch. Ouch. Because

1262
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:16,380
that was actually supposedly slated for April, still coming out at $50 retail. I'm like,

1263
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:21,620
yeah, no one's gonna buy that. Wow. So, yeah, they just cancelled it. Wow. I wonder if there's

1264
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:26,700
sales figures on how much that game actually sold. Oh, I'm sure there are. In fact, I have

1265
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:30,820
an idea where to look. Alright, well, while you do that, let me talk about some other

1266
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:35,580
games that aren't necessarily just there to be sold. It's actually kind of neat. This

1267
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:39,900
is over in Japan. There's a Nintendo game seminar program, and if you're a student of

1268
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:43,800
this, you get to make your own DS game, basically, as a part of the program. Well, Nintendo's

1269
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,380
actually taken these games that were created, and now they're available at DS download stations

1270
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:53,340
throughout Japan. And you can also get them through the Wii Nintendo channel. There's

1271
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:57,500
four games available. One of them is a mic controlled game in which you blow to kind

1272
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:02,780
of create air that sends stars up in the sky. Another one is where you are a voice artist

1273
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:07,920
that reads lines, and then when they're played back, they're given by like a weird character

1274
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:13,180
on screen, a random one or something. Another one is an action game where you move around

1275
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:17,380
and you pose, but I'm not sure exactly how that's done because they didn't say these

1276
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:22,700
were for the DSi, although, you know, I'm sure these will show up on the DSi, you know,

1277
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,880
eventually. Sure, if they can charge like two bucks for them, why not? And then the

1278
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:31,620
last one is a game about making faces. You shape weird things on these heads that don't

1279
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:35,860
have bodies and etc. So, but it's just kind of cool, you know, despite the fact that the

1280
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:39,780
games all sound like little one-trick ponies, it's kind of cool that, you know, they have

1281
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:44,740
this program where students can make these games over in Japan and, you know, not just

1282
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:47,540
that, but now they have kind of a way to get it out there. It's almost kind of like a little

1283
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:52,860
bit XNA-ish, so I don't know if that's something maybe this is a sign that Nintendo might use

1284
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:56,960
the DSi download service for this or some of their other distribution channels, but

1285
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:03,020
that is kind of an interesting thought, right? Yeah, although it could just be a bunch of

1286
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:09,400
crapware, I don't know. Okay, I've got the sales figures on Rock Revolution. Alright,

1287
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:16,820
can you source them or...? Yes, these are coming from VGcharts.com, and this is up-to-date

1288
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:20,740
sales figures. Although they have sales figures for Wii version of Rock Revolution, I guess

1289
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:30,180
it never came out over here, but whatever. 0.5 million copies were sold for the Xbox

1290
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:36,460
360 version. That is the highest of the three. That's not bad, that's a half million, right?

1291
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:45,540
0.5 million, or 0.05? 0.05 million. Oh, so 50,000. 50,000. And that is the best one out

1292
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:54,140
of all three versions. The PS3 version sold 0.02 million copies, or 20,000, and then finally

1293
01:39:54,140 --> 01:40:01,900
the DS version only sold 10,000 copies. Youch. Well, that's sad because the DS version seemed

1294
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:06,500
like the only one that made sense out of the bunch. But whatever. Alright, well thanks

1295
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,340
for looking that up for me. Alright, well, now we're going to get to the part of the

1296
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:14,340
show where you can always send us some questions and have them answered here live on air. It's

1297
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:18,940
the mailbag segment every week you guys send us emails. Mailbag at orangelauncher.com and

1298
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:22,460
we read our favorites live on air and respond to them. DarkSira, did we actually get some

1299
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:25,900
emails this week? I know you had to clean out the spam. Amongst the spam, yeah, really.

1300
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:35,740
Um, we got one from Cheeseburger. Aight. Dongle. It made me giggle. Smack. Inside, in a painful

1301
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:44,380
way. Did we get any emails of substance? Yes. Alright. Um, first of all, this is, it says

1302
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:50,860
Dear Sea Wow and Wow Bar and Dark Sakura Sky and Loki. So this is a multiple email. First,

1303
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:57,980
where, um, are my shows and, two, boy do I have a slew of reviews for you. Okay. Alright,

1304
01:40:57,980 --> 01:41:02,060
first, um, Tony Hawk's Project 8, another Tony Hawk title for the PSP, but this time

1305
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:09,260
around it is a bit more challenging. No auto-kick. The story is cheesy as always. But anyways

1306
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:17,220
it's awesome and if you are a skater, wanna be by this. I'm sorry I really can't read

1307
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:23,660
this. Yeah, I'm looking at this, it looks like it was written on a PSP. I'm going to

1308
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:32,380
try. Alright. Okay, I'm, I'm going to translate into English, okay? Will that be fine? Okay,

1309
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:39,100
Wipeout Pure. A lot of us, uh, kids who own a DS and own a GBA, um, know of F-Zero and

1310
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:45,460
GX. They have not released anything for a long time and I own a PSP. I thought that

1311
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:49,940
it would be a good idea. Instead, it was, and I'll tell you it was more of a challenge

1312
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:56,100
than F-Zero. GTA Liberty City, okay. I know you're thinking what a 15 year old is doing

1313
01:41:56,100 --> 01:42:01,700
with a GTA game. I bought it on Amazon using my debit card and got it a few weeks. I popped

1314
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:06,300
it in and I instantly love it. The custom soundtrack stuff takes some work, but once

1315
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:10,980
you do it, it's awesome. Killing police from my safe house with a sniper rifle and racking

1316
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:17,200
up a six star rating is so fun. Definitely recommend it to a first time PSP buyer. Lords

1317
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:21,920
of Dogtown, I love skateboarding and surfing stuff. This movie combined a little bit of

1318
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:29,020
both with a story about Jay Adams, Tony Alva, and Stacy Peralta. Okay. Um, alright, last

1319
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:33,200
thing. I have one question. Have you guys ever heard of Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment

1320
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:37,500
System or the Neo Geo CD King of Fighters is Better Than Street Fighter? Peace out,

1321
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:44,540
DS lover. Okay. First of all, I own, um, a Neo Geo and I, um, I have a Neo Geo CD as

1322
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:52,100
well and I have, um, a Neo Geo pocket color and a Neo Geo pocket. Um, so I'm really not

1323
01:42:52,100 --> 01:43:00,400
sure which one you're asking about, but King of Fighters, um, it really depends on what

1324
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:04,460
you're into. I love the King of Fighters series. I mean, talk about your cheap bitches and

1325
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:09,060
hard to pull off attacks. I mean, Street Fighter's a little bit more gratifying to play, but

1326
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:13,500
King of Fighters is just a little bit more, sometimes there's a bit more of a fun factor

1327
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:17,580
involved with the King of Fighters games. And I do have to say that if you've got it

1328
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:23,420
on the Neo Geo, you've got it arcade perfect and you have also paid for it. So that's all

1329
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:29,640
I can say about that. Rob? Um, you know, yeah, King of Fighters is sort of like an evolution

1330
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:35,100
of, uh, Fatal Fury and King, um, Art of Fighting in those games. And it's, it's okay. Like

1331
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:39,540
it's not something I really can usually tolerate long-term though, the SNK games, but they

1332
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:42,740
do have that whole, like, you know, foreground and background thing, which is kind of what

1333
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:47,240
made them famous. But, um, that was just, um, Fatal Fury. I don't, oh, was it just Fatal

1334
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:52,060
Fury? I thought King of Fighters had it too. My bad. Did Art of Fighting have it? No, I

1335
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,980
think just Fatal Fury. No, Art of Fighting had the weird zoom in and out thing. That

1336
01:43:54,980 --> 01:44:00,540
was our fighting did it too. The first one did at least. So it was Fatal Fury that had

1337
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:05,660
the background foreground. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, it's, it's, it's different and worth

1338
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:10,260
the play, but it, I don't think it's necessarily better. Does that make sense? But I love Capcom

1339
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:14,940
versus SNK. That's one of my favorite fighters right there. So Matt, what's your preference

1340
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:20,020
Street Fighter or King of Fighting? King of Fighters. Do you have a preference, Loki?

1341
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:25,300
Ron Street Fighter versus King of Fighters? No. You hate them all? Not hate, but I just

1342
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:30,220
don't really care. I will tell you this. Any of the King of Fighters games on Saturn have

1343
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:43,220
a bitch of a load time. Seriously. In between rounds. Load time. So, next email. Um, hi

1344
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:47,540
all. I was just wondering if it was possible for you guys to create a widget for Samsung

1345
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:51,980
phones for your podcast, as I would love to be able to listen to you on the go and download

1346
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:58,980
your shows wherever I am. Thanks Simil. Um, I've not even heard of the Samsung phones

1347
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:03,100
widget thing. That's not something I'm familiar with. Send us more information on how to make

1348
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:06,220
one. If it's just used doing a simple website or something, I'm sure we can figure it out

1349
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:10,620
if it involves programming like an iPhone application. Well, I don't know so much about

1350
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:14,780
that. Um, if it's something you can connect to iTunes, I don't know if your phone, I don't

1351
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:18,980
know because there's a lot of Samsung phones. Um, if your phone, my old phone was a Samsung

1352
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:22,580
and if it has a memory card, like my old one, you can put your own songs or your own music

1353
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:26,420
on it basically. Um, you should be able to just sync it up with iTunes and download our

1354
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:31,060
podcast on iTunes and do it that way. That's the best thing I can think of. If all fails,

1355
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:36,260
we can look in to see what that is. Yeah, if it's easy enough, why not? Um, we also

1356
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:41,060
got one, um, these are actually put in, that last one and this one that I'm about to actually

1357
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:45,860
put in through the website. Cool. So that's pretty cool. Um, first of all, the catch thing

1358
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:51,060
you got here is fucking terrible. Okay. Um, I got it wrong because it's really confusing

1359
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:55,900
and erased my whole goddamn message. Um, I don't really think that's the fault of the

1360
01:45:55,900 --> 01:46:01,260
program. Um, anyway, I was just wondering why the show takes so long to go up now. It

1361
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:05,700
used to go up the day after recording. Do not take this as a complaint. I am just curious.

1362
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:11,820
Um, just because we, my set up here changed and I have two computers now that I have to

1363
01:46:11,820 --> 01:46:15,660
go back and forth between and then also this week I was on a work trip. So it's just, I

1364
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:21,500
try to do it as I can. Other people are offering to help make the process go faster. So we'll

1365
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:27,340
hopefully get on that. So sorry. Last email and actually, you know what, I'm going to

1366
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:32,660
save this one for a last minute story, Rob. Okay. But I am going to go ahead and credit

1367
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:39,140
the story to, um, well they didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say, um, Nigel, thank

1368
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:45,500
you. All right. And it will be one of our last minute stories. Congrats. You have contributed

1369
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:50,860
to the show. All right. Level up. The winner is you. Here's a no prize. All right. If you

1370
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:55,820
want to send us emails, mailbag orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send them to. Let's get back

1371
01:46:55,820 --> 01:47:02,180
into some gaming news. Loki. Yes. Um, so there's some really neat download content that's going

1372
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:09,780
to be coming out very soon for F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin. It's called the Toy Soldiers

1373
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:14,460
download content. And what it is is it's a few multiplayer maps that they're adding in,

1374
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:18,700
but what's kind of neat about it is it's all done from the perspective that you're small

1375
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:24,860
little toy soldiers fighting in these giant areas. So for example, some of the maps that

1376
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:30,660
they have, they have, um, you know, a hospital room that you'll actually fight around in.

1377
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:35,740
They have a playground. And then finally, one that Jamie, I think, will like. They have

1378
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:42,980
one that you fight inside of a pinball machine. Sweet! Um, so yeah. Very cool. Kind of a unique,

1379
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:46,740
you know, twist to the whole multiplayer stuff. And I'm glad that they're actually kind of

1380
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:50,220
having a little bit of fun with it. But, um, looks pretty sweet. I have to say that the

1381
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:55,220
pinball machine looks the best out of all of them. Now only if the giant, you know,

1382
01:47:55,220 --> 01:48:03,500
metal balls rolling around in there too. That'd be cool. Hmm. But, um, no word on when exactly

1383
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:09,260
these will be available. Oh, I guess it'll be in April and it will be free. So that's

1384
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:16,580
awesome. Free stuff is always welcome. That's the best kind of download content is free.

1385
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:23,680
Well, a new trademark has been filed this week. Sing Hero is the trademark. Of course,

1386
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:30,940
you know, that was by Activision and Blizzard, the folks behind Guitar Hero and DJ Hero.

1387
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:35,940
Apparently now Sing Hero has been patented. Um, what do you think? Is this going to be

1388
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:44,900
their version of Sing Star or Karaoke Revolution or Milk of a Hero franchise? Mm hmm. Uh, although

1389
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:49,800
I will say though, keep in mind this company also trademarked Drum Villain and I don't

1390
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:54,060
think that ever happened. No. So just because they trademarked it doesn't mean the game

1391
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:59,060
is actually going to happen. Yeah, but they also could mean just because, you know, they

1392
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:04,360
trademarked Drum Villain, maybe they just rolled that into Guitar Hero World Tour. But

1393
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:07,900
Singing is in Guitar Hero World Tour, so I'm not sure why they are going to have this whole

1394
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:12,700
separate game. Well, maybe this is going to have more pop music. That could be. Oh boy.

1395
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:17,620
Well, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear stories like this, I can just hear

1396
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:22,100
the sounds of the Guitar Hero franchise being milked even more and that's like after seeing

1397
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:25,740
the arcade game this week and everything and it's just like, I'm starting to get pretty

1398
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:30,300
sick of all this stuff and it just makes me angsty because, you know, it used to be such

1399
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:34,500
a good game, but now it's just getting, like beating a dead horse. So I get angsty and

1400
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:54,420
that's why the FUs of the week happen. I have a couple of FUs, but one of them is a very

1401
01:49:54,420 --> 01:50:02,300
big, very major one and it's directed towards my body for reasons that I choose not to disclose

1402
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:08,180
publicly at this time, but certain people know what I'm talking about. And the second

1403
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:19,180
one goes towards a lack of tact. I'm dead. Loki! Happy to Burger King for burning my

1404
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:25,300
fries. I have never, honestly I'd expect this kind of thing from McDonald's because they

1405
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:30,420
fuck up their fries more times than not, but Burger King, come on man, your fries are usually

1406
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:35,940
pretty tasteless and they're fixed by ketchup, but these fries were burnt. I mean, they were

1407
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:41,980
brown. Oh, and the other thing too, if you ask me if I want ketchup with my fries, don't

1408
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:47,040
just not give me ketchup. Don't ask me the question and just say, oh, here's no ketchup

1409
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:51,340
for you. You'd like some ketchup, wouldn't you? But I'm not giving you any. I'm not giving

1410
01:50:51,340 --> 01:51:01,060
you any. So F you to minimum wage Burger King workers. Well, geez, and as GS68 in chat says,

1411
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:06,260
poor, poor Loki's fries. I don't really have anything that major this week. I guess two

1412
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:11,460
F yous. One F you goes to jet lag because that sucks and my sleep has been all screwed

1413
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:15,500
up like for the past four days because of it. I was in Washington DC this week, by the

1414
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:20,180
way, just for a few days. If you were following me on Twitter, you probably saw some of that

1415
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:25,020
video. Otherwise my only other F you would go to the fact that we have no Dunkin Donuts

1416
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:31,100
here in California, at least in NorCal. And that's sad because I fricking love their coffee.

1417
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:36,220
But I actually, I actually brought back a Dunkin Donut for my roommate on the plane

1418
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:40,940
from Texas because I always gush about, you know, Dunkin Donuts, even though the donuts,

1419
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:44,780
the donuts are only okay. Like to me, I'm not as huge on the donut. It's the coffee.

1420
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:51,620
I love the coffee. They're not bad. If my five year old memory serves me right. They're

1421
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:57,500
not bad at all. So that's really it. Those are my not so serious F yous of the week,

1422
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:00,780
but that's what I've got. I guess the jet, the jet lag one's actually pretty serious.

1423
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:05,020
That really was annoying. I did want to say though about a Sing Hero. I wanted to read

1424
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:09,140
some comments here in chat about that because I thought one of these in particular was pretty

1425
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:15,660
good. Game Guru, I believe said that they might just be trying to protect their trademark.

1426
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:19,580
I think it's just protecting trademarks says Game Guru about Sing Hero. And that could

1427
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:22,540
be the case. Do you think they're just trying to trademark the name so nobody else tries

1428
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:29,020
to use it? That could be. Maybe. I hope that's the case. If that's the case, then I remember

1429
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:35,140
a Game Guru also says, I always remember that Dunkin Donut cereal. Me too. Hmm. I actually

1430
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:39,980
remember that too. They sold that here too. And they don't have Dunkin Donuts. Oh, whatever.

1431
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:44,260
Hit stun says F you Sky. You have arcades with Street Fighter four and we don't. I do.

1432
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:49,140
Oh, I guess here in California. Yeah. I just haven't driven to them. Not around us. Not

1433
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:55,100
here in SAC, but we do have the Guitar Hero arcade now and they have Mario Kart too, which

1434
01:52:55,100 --> 01:53:00,100
I didn't check out, but they have that. I thought that would be fun. You can go play

1435
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:06,180
it. Yeah, but I don't know. I didn't really care for Mario Kart arcade. It was kind of

1436
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:10,740
lame. It was, but maybe the sequel has fixed some things. You never know. No doubt it.

1437
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:17,900
All right, let's get into another story. They need more F-Zero GX. They do need more F-Zero

1438
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:23,500
GX. Well, there is another interesting thing. You know how all these Lego games been coming

1439
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:30,900
out? There's more. More, more, more. Which means people must be buying all the ones that

1440
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:35,020
are out there now. You know what though? They're doing it for a good reason because they are

1441
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:41,100
pretty damn fun. But once it's sort of a late franchise now, they're doing a Harry Potter

1442
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:46,420
Lego. It's never too late. I'm not saying what exactly it's going to be, but maybe it's

1443
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:54,940
going to be a walk through some of the other books. And then there is a Lego Indiana Jones

1444
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:59,980
2 The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. As long as you don't have the fucking ending crap

1445
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:06,540
in it. God damn it. And they're also pitching to Peter Jackson for a game based off of the

1446
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:14,300
upcoming Hobbit movie. Lego Hobbits? Lego Hobbits. I totally saw the whole Harry Potter

1447
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:18,740
thing coming out. After all, they do have the Lego Harry Potter toys. And Lego Indiana

1448
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:24,860
Jones 2 or whatever they're going to be doing. I love Lego Hobbit. As much as the fourth

1449
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:30,420
movie sucked, the first game really, really sold well for them and still continues to

1450
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:37,020
sell well for them. I'm not surprised at one bit. But basing your game, I would have to

1451
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:44,220
guess it would probably be the original game plus the new stuff as well. I don't know.

1452
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:47,300
They're kind of fun. I mean, I understand why they're coming out. It's not like one

1453
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:52,060
of these games I look at and go, WTF? Why are we getting this? But I get this. So it's

1454
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:55,500
not really a surprise at all. And you've been speculating, Loki, for quite some time that

1455
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:59,660
the Harry Potter game is going to be the next Lego thing. Of course. This is no surprise

1456
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:03,460
at all. If they've got a toy for it, they're going to make a game for it. Now, if you see

1457
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:08,140
like all of a sudden Lego Halo, you know, stuffed toys coming out, then you better believe

1458
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:11,020
that there's going to be a Lego Halo game at some point. But otherwise it's an April

1459
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:15,700
Fools joke. Yes, otherwise it's an April Fools joke. Fair enough. I wouldn't be surprised

1460
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:18,500
if we see another Lego Batman game because that's something that they can keep adding

1461
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:27,900
to and basically have unlimited content for because they're not basing off movies. So

1462
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:31,420
that's a problem basing stuff off movies. They don't make any more movies. You have

1463
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:35,860
no more games. Another comment from Game Guru in chat. Unfortunately, Lego Prince of Persia

1464
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:41,460
will likely be next when the toys come out. Will it though? Because they rebooted the

1465
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:46,940
Prince of Persia franchise recently. Won't they make this sequel in that kind of way?

1466
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:51,540
I don't know if they'll do a Lego Prince of Persia game. The problem being is that it's

1467
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:57,520
a Warner Brothers own franchise. Well, the Lego Star Wars stuff that was LucasArts, but

1468
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:04,500
you know, basically they're doing Warner Brothers stuff. So, maybe. I mean, if they do, if the

1469
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:08,420
movie comes out and it's really popular and stuff and everyone's interested in it, I don't

1470
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:11,900
know if they're really going to do it. It would all depend on how many toys come out

1471
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:16,460
and how well the toys do. Rice Princess in chat says, I love Lego games. I love Harry

1472
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:24,540
Potter games. The two combined would make my head asplode. Let's see. Gio Vaidya says,

1473
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:30,020
Lego doesn't sell the HP sets anymore. You can't even get the sets off Lego.com. That's

1474
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:37,900
true. Hmm. Interesting. Dark Tetsuya says, still waiting on Lego Watchmen. Yeah, I don't

1475
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:43,860
know about that one. Will it come complete with a detachable penis? For Dr. Manhattan.

1476
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:49,060
Special soundtrack by King Missile. No, he'll have, he'll have his little like, you know,

1477
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:57,580
molecular underpants, which I did not understand because, you know, they, he could wear underpants

1478
01:56:57,580 --> 01:57:02,020
but he didn't and he doesn't really exist. I never saw the movie. The whole point was

1479
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:08,180
that he's detached from humanity and humanity's standard so it doesn't matter to him if he's

1480
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:12,420
dressed or not. Because, I mean, seriously, if you think about it, one of the Viet Cong

1481
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:16,540
will be really scared of a giant glowing blue penis that's coming towards them. I mean,

1482
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:22,500
you know why? I am so down with Dr. Manhattan. He was wearing his black pants. Exactly, that's

1483
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,700
what I'm saying. He should have just been buck wild there. I mean, I'm just going to

1484
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:29,020
do the show naked from now on. I agree with what Dr. Manhattan said. Really, it doesn't

1485
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:34,940
matter, you know, no amount of blue penis makes that movie any good, so, oh well. Sad

1486
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:40,220
trombone. Sad trombone, yes, very much so. Something that's not so sad though is the

1487
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:46,420
popularity of Call of Duty 4. It has reached 15 million online players now, which is no

1488
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:51,260
surprise for anybody that plays Call of Duty 4 and of course, you know, this will be good

1489
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:55,780
for the new Call of Duty game that's scheduled to come out this year later, Call of Duty

1490
01:57:55,780 --> 01:58:02,260
Modern Warfare 2. So, that should do just as well, since it's going to be Infinity Ward

1491
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:08,580
again, because everyone knows that Treyarch sucks. I know a lot of people who play Call

1492
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:16,260
of Duty 4. This number doesn't surprise me one bit. No. Well, as if there weren't enough

1493
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:19,820
people that were going to be lining up to buy the new Beatles Rock Band game. I'm not

1494
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:24,700
lining up to buy this game. Well, you're one of not many, because there's a lot of people

1495
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:28,660
who are very interested in this game. Apparently though, Danny Harrison, that would be the

1496
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:34,460
son of George Harrison, one of the Beatles who passed away a few years ago, he was interviewed

1497
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:39,820
by Billboard recently, and they were talking about the Beatles Rock Band game. Apparently,

1498
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:45,220
what Danny said is that, or it might be Donnie, sorry, it's going to come with some new material,

1499
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:53,380
stuff that has never been heard and never released. Huh. That could be very interesting.

1500
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:56,420
So that, I mean, as if this game wasn't going to sell to the Beatles collectors already,

1501
01:58:56,420 --> 01:59:00,740
imagine if this game has never before heard Beatles stuff. I couldn't believe that anything

1502
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:07,260
like that still exists, to be honest, but there you go. Apparently, by the way, Donnie,

1503
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:11,460
who's the son of, of course, George Harrison, he's been a big part of actually trying to

1504
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:15,300
get the Beatles Rock Band to happen. He's in a band of his own who has an album coming

1505
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:20,100
out this month. He actually took the project to Apple and sort of convinced everyone, because

1506
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:26,500
of course, not Apple as in the iPhone people, but Apple Music, right, and convinced everyone

1507
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:32,380
to sort of have a presentation. The game has been in the making for two years. They say

1508
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:37,980
it's historically accurate, a real headache, but it's the most enjoyable work that he's

1509
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:43,620
been a part of apparently. So it sounds like it could be interesting. Could be. 9-9-0-9

1510
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:48,620
is when this game's coming out. It's pretty hard to forget that release date. Well, hey,

1511
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:53,820
all we have to do is remember Dreamcast. Or that. Yep. Which, oh, you know, I forgot to

1512
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:57,380
mention in the gaming week, we actually did bust out the Dreamcast and go through some

1513
01:59:57,380 --> 02:00:03,500
Sonic Adventure. Nice. Yeah. All of our VMUs still work. Oh my gosh. We have all of our

1514
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:13,060
Samba files too. So, here's some other news. You know, Wallace and Gromit, still out there.

1515
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:19,580
There is actually a game coming out on March 24th with a demo on the 16th. Telltale Games

1516
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:26,700
is putting this out. But it's part of, as far as I'm aware, the episodic Wallace and

1517
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:35,700
Gromit's Grand Adventures. So, hey, keep your eyes open for it. And there's also gonna be

1518
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:44,060
another Strong Bad game. If you pre-order Wallace and Gromit, you'll get a full episode

1519
02:00:44,060 --> 02:00:51,740
of actually Sam and Max and Strong Bad. So there you go. That's pretty cool. Nice. Nice

1520
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:59,700
little bonus there. I like full games as bonuses. That's a good deal. Definitely. Now this is

1521
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:07,900
kind of not new to the MMO scene, but Final Fantasy XI has finally jumped on board, much

1522
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:12,900
like the Blizzard Authenticator. They now have something very similar to that that will

1523
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:21,860
generate random passcodes every few minutes, I guess. It's the Final Fantasy XI security

1524
02:01:21,860 --> 02:01:27,380
token. And, of course, the constantly changing login passwords will apparently protect your

1525
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:35,620
account from hackers. And the only thing, though, is they haven't released a price for

1526
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:42,900
it yet. But it will come with some in-game exclusive items when you purchase this token.

1527
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:52,300
Huh. Okay. So you get special stuff in the actual game? Yes. You get, like, stuff in

1528
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:58,300
the game. Hm. Nah, I'm still not interested in going back. Sorry. Alright. One more story

1529
02:01:58,300 --> 02:02:02,100
for you guys, then we're gonna open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on

1530
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:06,060
Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Oh, I was gonna, real quickly, I was gonna mention the Van

1531
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:13,020
Deal Collection. Yeah, $14.99 now. Oh my gosh, on Xbox 360? And Windows. Wow, they're really

1532
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:18,860
trying to get new crack addicts on that game, because, you know, you pay that once, they

1533
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:22,740
might as well just give the game away, because you get 30 days for free with that, and $14.99

1534
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:27,140
is how much it costs a month, right? Yeah. I'm surprised they haven't gone the route

1535
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:30,260
of just doing a downloadable demo, or have they, and I just missed that. I don't know.

1536
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,780
Maybe they did, and I might have missed that. Alright, look, one more story for you guys,

1537
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:38,980
completely different side note here, but something also to kind of take a note. Here's the thing.

1538
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:43,940
This guy from a Yale University, he's a Yale University student, so you know he's smart.

1539
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:49,700
His name is Jesse Meiman. Or is connected. Yeah, could be. There's a report in the Cincinnati

1540
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:55,580
Enquirer that Jesse's a little pissed off, because he flew US Airways, and he was flying

1541
02:02:55,580 --> 02:03:01,500
them in December from Connecticut to Ohio, and they basically lost his Xbox 360. He went

1542
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:05,420
to pick up his luggage after he landed, and he noticed that everything was there except

1543
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:10,780
for the Xbox 360 and all the accompanying components, so I'm assuming he believes that

1544
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:17,940
it was theft. His suit says after that that he got weeks of an unconscionable runaround,

1545
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:24,640
so you know what happened next, right? He's suing them. He's suing US Airways for a million

1546
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:32,860
dollars for the loss of the Xbox. That apparently is the maximal amount allowable by law. One

1547
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:39,380
million dollars is what he's suing for. He says that thing was his DVD player. He's a

1548
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:43,740
film studies major. I don't know why you're using the Xbox 360 issue. Well, I guess I

1549
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:47,980
can see that. Don't you have a Blu-ray player? Upscale on the HD, right? I guess. But anyway,

1550
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:51,580
here's the thing. He wants the airline to pay him $1,700 for the loss of the gaming

1551
02:03:51,580 --> 02:03:56,020
system because apparently he probably had his own editions on it. I don't know. And

1552
02:03:56,020 --> 02:04:03,620
for non-economic distress of at least $25,000, but he's seeking the maximum, one million.

1553
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:08,140
Go figure. I don't know exactly how that works. But here's the thing. US Air would like to

1554
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:15,860
point out their policy state that the federal loss limits are capped out at $3,300 per bag,

1555
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:22,260
and the airline's luggage policy excludes liability for electronics. So something you

1556
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:25,900
might want to think about before you take these expensive electronics online. But if

1557
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:29,660
that specific thing is missing, then it's clearly a case of theft. Yeah. I could see

1558
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:37,340
if maybe he, you know, and the other thing they could do too is they have his bag, you

1559
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:43,380
know, they have it scaled in there, they know what the weight of the bag was, and then when

1560
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:47,860
the bag gets to wherever they should have scaled it again, oh, there's a clear difference

1561
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:54,300
in weight in the bag. I mean, those Xbox 360s weigh like 15 pounds, you know. Obviously

1562
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:59,060
they stole it. I mean, there's no way that it didn't break, you know, during the flight,

1563
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:04,020
which, you know, that I don't see really being the airline's fault. I mean, but the fact

1564
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:08,420
that it was stolen is a little different. But at that same time, he should only get

1565
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:14,740
compensated for the replacement of the system. Not a million dollars, not even $3,300. Some

1566
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:19,220
comments from chat, because of course you know the chat is interested in this. SSJ100Matt

1567
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:24,060
says, I always bring my console on the plane with me or not at all. True, he could have

1568
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:28,660
brought it in just to carry on, right, if it was that important. Dekeman says, if it

1569
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:32,900
was broken, yes, but it was stolen. If you ask for a million, though, suddenly a settlement

1570
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:37,220
of $500,000 is looking pretty good. So maybe this guy's just trying to highball it, I don't

1571
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:45,220
know. You just try to highball it. Gripper01 says, God help Microsoft if it ever red rings.

1572
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:51,320
What a good point. So, alright. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username

1573
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:54,980
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to open up the Skype line, take a couple of

1574
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:59,060
calls. Probably not too many tonight, because we are running a little long tonight, but

1575
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:03,660
we also want to get to last minute stories here in just a little bit, and all that fun

1576
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:07,620
stuff. So, go ahead and give us a call now. We do have a call, we'll go to that. Hi, you're

1577
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:16,380
on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? It's GS68. Hey, GS68, what's on your mind? Hold on. Okay,

1578
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:24,420
I'll wait. I got Gradius Rebirth this week. What? I got Gradius Rebirth this week. It

1579
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:31,900
came out this Monday, much to my surprise. Oh, Gradius 3, tell us, wait, Gradius Rebirth

1580
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:38,020
or Gradius 3? Rebirth. Ooh, tell us a little bit about Gradius Rebirth. I'm going to put

1581
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:43,900
you on with Loki here, I got to take care of something in the studio. Alright, then.

1582
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:51,820
So, tell us about the game, what do you think of it? Yeah, basically, it's a new Gradius

1583
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:57,420
title, and it looks more like a 16-bit or 32-bit Gradius game, kind of like Gradius

1584
02:06:57,420 --> 02:07:06,500
for your, a bit like Gradius Gaiden, and it's more of a remix of older Gradius games rather

1585
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:13,380
than a completely new title. I'm watching a replay of myself right now, and my replay

1586
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:23,140
is on stage 2, which looks like a level from the MSX and MSX game. Okay. Sounds pretty

1587
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:30,980
cool. But, yeah, it's only five stages, though. For 1,000 waypoints, that might turn off a

1588
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:38,940
few players, but as a result, Gradius 3, I just had to get in the game. And one of my

1589
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:45,420
favorite things is on stage 1, there are two enemies, and it destroys either one first,

1590
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:50,060
you can change the entire stage depending on which enemies are, like, if you don't destroy

1591
02:07:50,060 --> 02:07:55,500
either, the stage continues as normal, but if you destroy the top enemy, the stage becomes

1592
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:59,780
frozen. If you destroy the bottom enemy, all the units in the stage become active and the

1593
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:10,020
stage gets harder. Huh. That's kind of neat. Yeah. And then, looking at the weaponry sort

1594
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:15,020
of game, you have the usual Gradius title, which is like regular missile and double and

1595
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:21,580
laser, and then you have another one where you have a bomb attack, and then a twin laser

1596
02:08:21,580 --> 02:08:27,020
that's weaker than the, it's not as powerful as the regular laser, but it shoots faster,

1597
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:33,900
and then there's two unlockable setups that are more or less for more challenging players,

1598
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:40,300
I guess. Hmm. Well, that was pretty cool. I was actually kind of thinking of checking

1599
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:46,940
this out, I just haven't gotten a chance to download it yet, that and that new one that's

1600
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:51,580
coming out on Monday here, Bit Trip, or was it Bit Trip Beat or whatever, it looks pretty

1601
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:58,420
awesome. But hopefully, you know, I know they've been probably a little bit inspired by the

1602
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:03,060
Mega Man 9 stuff, so hopefully we see more of these retro remakes that aren't exactly,

1603
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:10,300
you know, retro, I guess. That's kind of cool. It still kind of feels like a new Gradius

1604
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:17,380
to me, at least. It was Mega Man 9, it felt like it was playing an old NES game. Yeah.

1605
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:24,860
You know, I always... Yeah, because it got, for a game that some say looks like 16-bit,

1606
02:09:24,860 --> 02:09:33,580
the graphics are a little, on the more colorful side. Hmm. I hope they bring some of this

1607
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:38,420
stuff out, you know, I can see you make, they should do a Gradius collection on like DS

1608
02:09:38,420 --> 02:09:42,940
or something, and have this in there. They have a Gradius collection on PSP in Japan.

1609
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:47,620
I know, but they, well they have it here too, but they all have... They have a Parodius collection.

1610
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:53,380
But they need it on DS as well. I'll use Salamander collection, but the fact that it's my old

1611
02:09:53,380 --> 02:10:00,380
PSP has a crappy D-pad, it's turning me off from it. Hmm. And I don't want to get a new

1612
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:05,820
PSP, because then I'll have to restart my DKMax save files, because they're locked at

1613
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:14,900
a current PSP. Yeah. Well, cool. Is there any other WiiWare games you're looking forward

1614
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:23,460
to checking out? Um, don't think so. I have a few favorites that I want to buy. I have

1615
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:36,820
a few older games that I've been wanting to buy. Cool. So, crisis averted? I guess. Oh,

1616
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:42,460
no, we have Rob trying to find his microphone. Yes, we're back to normal, sorry, but I'm

1617
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:48,860
sorry I missed the review, but let me just quickly ask for a summary. Is it worth breaking

1618
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:58,380
my boycott over? Hmm. It's certainly not the best... Well, it depends on what game is enough

1619
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:04,820
to make you break your boycott. I mean, there's more of a game for hardcore Gradius fans,

1620
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:09,380
like, I mean, most people feel like it's part of the fact that it's only five stages, and

1621
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:15,300
it doesn't really add much to the series. Hmm. Well, yeah, I know, and there's some

1622
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:19,300
comments from chat, like GameGuru says, Final Fantasy IV, the after years will be cool as

1623
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:23,060
well, and yeah, those are other types of games I'm looking forward to, so I just hope Nintendo

1624
02:11:23,060 --> 02:11:26,540
will fix their freaking storage problems sooner rather than later, because, you know, even

1625
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:34,380
I admit my boycott is getting stupid. I'd like Defender Castle to get this game. We'll

1626
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:37,300
see, we'll see. I do love Defender Castle, though. Alright, we're gonna let you go so

1627
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:39,820
we can get some more calls, but thank you for the review. Sorry I wasn't here to hear

1628
02:11:39,820 --> 02:11:45,560
it all. Alright. Alright. Yeah, it's cool. Later. Alright, yeah. We had, like, an insect

1629
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:48,760
outbreak here in studio, because a piece of my sandwich fell on the ground, so all the

1630
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:53,480
ants rose up from the ground and were like, rah! They rise from the grave. They rise from

1631
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:58,580
your grave, and so they all decided to, yeah, have a piece of that. I thought it was cute

1632
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:02,580
how you took care of it. Well, I took care of it right away, right? Alright, let's take

1633
02:12:02,580 --> 02:12:06,140
a couple more calls here tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this? Hey, that

1634
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:11,460
was pretty quick. It's me, Ranma. Hi, Ranma. Hey, what's up, everyone? Not much. We're

1635
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:17,100
ant-free now. What's up? I just want you guys to know that I took one for the team two weeks

1636
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:21,100
ago, and I want some type of compensation for it. Oh, dear. What's this about? We don't

1637
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:26,940
have compensation. We don't get compensated, so this has got to be good. I actually sat

1638
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:31,940
there and watched Street Fighter, The Legend of Chun-Li. Hey, no one made you do that.

1639
02:12:31,940 --> 02:12:35,900
We warned you in advance. Yeah, that's right. We told everybody that was gonna be a pretty

1640
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:41,060
shitty movie. See, the fact of the matter is I didn't even pay for it. I went and downloaded

1641
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:45,940
it, because I said I am not spending $1,125 on this piece of crap. Not that we would usually

1642
02:12:45,940 --> 02:12:53,180
advocate piracy, but maybe in that case it'll be okay. Yeah. I mean, they made the movie

1643
02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:57,620
a little bit too realistic, and I don't care if I give spoilers or not, because that's

1644
02:12:57,620 --> 02:13:04,400
how bad this movie was. Alright. Number one. Bison should not be walking around in a mustache

1645
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:14,100
and a goatee. Okay. Number two. Vega's mask should not look like a cross between Vader

1646
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:23,220
and Shy Guy. Ew. Number three. In the fight sequence in the club, Chun-Li could have at

1647
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:29,100
least had some type of blue dress or something to signify her traditional outfit, you know?

1648
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:33,940
And how the hell does she have injuries on her when you didn't look like she had any

1649
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:42,180
in the movie when she was fighting? I don't know. Not for nothing, I'll say this. After

1650
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:49,140
seeing this movie, the original Street Fighter is ten times better, and I am so looking forward

1651
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:58,540
to Dragon Ball Evolution after this. I don't know, it doesn't look, well, Dragon Ball Evolution

1652
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:04,860
doesn't look as bad. Pretty much. I'm just saying, I think after seeing this, that's

1653
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:10,340
gonna be a lot better. Maybe he could do both in one day, and then if you watch them back-to-back

1654
02:14:10,340 --> 02:14:14,220
and you watch this first one that's really craptacular, the second one won't seem so

1655
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:22,900
bad. Do you think it's a shoo-in to win all the Razzie awards next year? No, I don't think

1656
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:33,100
it's that bad. Now if U.A. Boyle had anything to do with it, by default, it would. Okay.

1657
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:39,060
Do you think U.A. Boyle makes better movies than this? I can make better movies than this,

1658
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:50,180
and I have an amateur digital camcorder I got from Joe Dea that I'm borrowing. Well, congratulations.

1659
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:58,140
My sister, who is graduating from Hofstra as a degree in Filming, she could do something

1660
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:07,500
better than this. I've seen her do better work than this, you know? Well, every actor,

1661
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:14,740
every director usually has a stinker somewhere in their career, so what can you do? I know,

1662
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:18,780
I know, and it does help the fact that my roommate is a big Chun-Li fan, and I warned

1663
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:24,820
him, so, yeah. Well, you know, we all told you it would suck, and I have yet to hear

1664
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:29,140
anybody say it's good. I want to hear a good review on this movie. Has Rotten Tomatoes,

1665
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:34,460
is it zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes? I think it is, somebody just linked Rotten Tomatoes

1666
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:37,480
there in chat, I'm gonna look at this, see if it still has a zero percent from all the

1667
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:45,140
critics out there. I don't wanna see your stupid ad, come on. I'm skipping the ad right

1668
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:52,900
now. Yeah, I'm trying to skip it too, but it's so frickin' slow. Alright. Four percent.

1669
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:58,180
Somebody gave it a positive review. Here it is from Variety, of course it's Variety. Neither

1670
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:01,980
the best nor the worst of movies derived from video games, Street Fighter, The Legend of

1671
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:10,140
Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to oogle besides the titular heroine. Huh.

1672
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:14,420
Well there you go. A whopping four percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, Rama, nobody forced

1673
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:18,100
you to watch it, I don't know what to tell you. I was bored, what can I tell you, I couldn't

1674
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:24,740
get any alcohol. No compensation for Morison's Radio, sorry. Our compensation is go watch

1675
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:30,920
Silent Hill again and see a good game movie. Yes. Or the original Mortal Kombat if you

1676
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:35,780
ask me. The first Mortal Kombat was fantastic. Yeah, it's not bad. Yes it was. I'd even,

1677
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:44,180
I would even say it was really close to theme. The second one is Time Is Life, you know,

1678
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:50,500
I wish I had back. I hope the third one comes out some day. Alright, Rama we're gonna let

1679
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:54,540
you go so we can get some more calls, but take care buddy, okay? You too, alright, later

1680
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:58,620
everyone. We'll try to do at least one more call here. Do we have any last minute stories?

1681
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:05,740
Dark Sakura, I know you had one. You alright over there? Dark Sakura's gonna hopefully

1682
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:11,620
give us a last minute story here. Anyway, I'm glad the microphone didn't catch that.

1683
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:14,260
Let me actually go ahead and take a call because our phone's ringing off the hook here. It

1684
02:17:14,260 --> 02:17:18,860
just took a little bit. Hi Aaron, I'll show you, who's this? Sorry. Hey, this is Ray,

1685
02:17:18,860 --> 02:17:23,020
this is actually my first time calling, I've been listening to this show for four years

1686
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:27,760
now I guess. Well. Two years now, I've missed once. It's good to hear from you, I'm sorry

1687
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:32,540
I missed your name because you're a little quiet. What was your name again? Oh, Ray.

1688
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:39,780
Ry? R-A-Y. Oh. R-A-Y, yeah, it's my real name, heaven forbid. Okay. Well what is up, Ray?

1689
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:44,420
Uh, nothing really, it's 11 o'clock on spring break, all my friends are away, I have nothing

1690
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:49,100
to do but stay up till 11 o'clock and listen to this show, I love it. I don't think I've

1691
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:53,100
missed a week. Well, thank you very much, we appreciate you listening to the show. Did

1692
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:56,700
you hear something on tonight's show that you wanted to comment on? Any of the stories?

1693
02:17:56,700 --> 02:18:02,980
Yeah, actually, uh, indie games pretty much. I can't remember the specifics because I was

1694
02:18:02,980 --> 02:18:05,580
just thinking of something to call about, so I'm not just here battling like an idiot

1695
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:10,260
on the internet, but Cave Story, has anyone played it? I'm pretty sure it's low-key, might

1696
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:15,140
have. Um, no, tell us a little more about this game, I don't think I've heard of this.

1697
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:21,980
Uh, Cave Story. Have you ever heard of Cave Story? It's a PC title, it's pretty cool.

1698
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:26,260
Oh, I guess it's coming to the Wii. Oh, okay. It is coming to the Wii, that's why I brought

1699
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:31,020
it up, because it's getting a graphical redesign, but on the PC, it's free, it's translated

1700
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:37,300
from Japanese, and it's kind of a, I want to say classic style shooter, sort of like

1701
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:42,300
Mega Man, but a whole lot harder. No, wait, I'm lying, no, it's a little easier, because

1702
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:47,860
I beat it, and I'm not that good at Mega Man games. I thought I'd notice that Google Cave

1703
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:53,660
Story or English translation should come up one of the first few topics. Well, our chat

1704
02:18:53,660 --> 02:18:57,120
room sure seems to know this game, and I'm actually trying to look up a little bit online

1705
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:01,220
to see if I know anything about this, and sadly, no, I don't know how I missed this,

1706
02:19:01,220 --> 02:19:05,260
I guess I just, I'm not cool. I've talked about Cave Story before. Have you? Yeah, a

1707
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:09,500
couple times, I don't care for it, but it's neat. Um, I guess they're making a version

1708
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:16,380
on PSP as well, it looks like? Homebrew. It's a Homebrew project. Oh, okay. Huh, interesting

1709
02:19:16,380 --> 02:19:22,580
though. How did you find this game? I was looking through a list of Homebrew PSP games,

1710
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:27,740
and I found it there, and I learned more about it, and it had a PC version, which was really

1711
02:19:27,740 --> 02:19:31,780
good. Really good. It's the same game, almost, but it looks bigger, better. I don't know

1712
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:39,780
why, is it just me, or does this game look very, like, old-school 8-bit NES-style graphics?

1713
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:47,900
Precisely. Another thing I wanted to mention was, um, Team Fortress 2 had an 8-bit demake

1714
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:55,660
called Gang Garrison 2. I have not seen this. Oh, it's a side-scrolling, isometric shooter,

1715
02:19:55,660 --> 02:20:01,060
but it's team-based online, and it's anywhere from 10 players at a time to 100 players at

1716
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:06,660
a time. Huh. Yeah, you can play as all nine major classes, and it's kind of simplified,

1717
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:11,500
but there's still technique to it, like, uh, the Pyro has the Puffer instead of the Backbringer,

1718
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:15,980
there's none of the special extra weapons, and you can deflect rockets back, and 50 on

1719
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:21,100
50 matches are crazy. I've installed it on the computer lab at, uh, my school. It's pretty

1720
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:27,340
neat. Do they let you do that? We have a kind of lax administrator, and we put it on thumb

1721
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:33,180
drives anyway, so it's alright. It's only five megs. Gotcha. Alright, alright. Um,

1722
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:36,700
here's my question. I noticed, you mentioned this game as a demake, and we've talked about,

1723
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:39,700
I know last week's show we were talking about, like, a Final Fantasy X demake and some of

1724
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:44,260
this stuff. What do you think makes these demakes so popular, where people go back in

1725
02:20:44,260 --> 02:20:47,460
time and remake games such as, like, you know, Team Fortress 2 or whatever, whatever the

1726
02:20:47,460 --> 02:20:51,860
game is? Why do you think people want to keep remaking, or Guitar Hero has had tons of these,

1727
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:56,340
like, in the Commodore 64 and stuff. Why do people want to remake these games on old systems?

1728
02:20:56,340 --> 02:21:01,540
What do you think is the allure of it? Well, it's kind of like, almost the opposite of,

1729
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:09,620
uh, the, what was that? I think it's the opposite of, uh, say, just a second here, how Mega

1730
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:17,700
Man X, one of the later X games, took the classic Mega Man action from a pseudo-3D view.

1731
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:21,300
It's sort of strange seeing the new medium, exactly as with the Guitar Hero Commodore

1732
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:29,540
remake. Hmm. I don't know, I don't get into a whole lot of these. I don't know if I necessarily,

1733
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:33,060
usually I'm just kind of like, oh, hmm, that's neat, but I don't really have to, like, play

1734
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:36,020
the whole thing in its entirety, so it's just kind of, it's kind of interesting that there's

1735
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:40,260
this whole kind of community around there, around the demakes. I always thought it was interesting.

1736
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:45,380
There's a Silent Hill 2 remake, I think it was, like, Soundless Mountain 2.

1737
02:21:46,180 --> 02:21:49,620
Really? For what system? I know. PC.

1738
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:51,860
Huh. Interesting.

1739
02:21:51,860 --> 02:21:58,820
Look up, uh, Google TIG source demake composition, or, uh, Competition Camera Witch,

1740
02:21:59,380 --> 02:22:04,980
these funny titles sometimes. They had one for, uh, like a Dig Dug demake, I wonder how they

1741
02:22:04,980 --> 02:22:07,620
pulled that off. I don't know how they pulled that off.

1742
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:10,660
Dig Dug demake? Wasn't Dig Dug kind of an old-ass game to begin with?

1743
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:15,940
Yeah, that's what I was wondering. They have one for Left 4 Dead called Left 4K Dead,

1744
02:22:15,940 --> 02:22:20,180
which is Java-based, and it's 4K at 4 kilobytes already.

1745
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:22,340
Huh. Wow.

1746
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:24,580
Pretty sure they had a Bioshock demake, too.

1747
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:28,580
Nah, I've seen the Bioshock demake. Interesting. Wow, there's a whole lot.

1748
02:22:28,580 --> 02:22:32,660
And again, lots of positive feedback to Cave Story in our chatroom. GameGuru says,

1749
02:22:32,660 --> 02:22:36,820
but yeah, Cave Story is a Metroidvania worth buying and it's free on PC. Any PC gamer should

1750
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:42,180
own it. I might have to just seek that out. So you found that amongst all the chat about Wang?

1751
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:44,740
What? In the chatroom?

1752
02:22:44,740 --> 02:22:49,380
No, I didn't. I haven't been paying attention to chat, sorry. Well, I mean, I have, but I haven't.

1753
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:52,580
What's the big deal with Wang? Oh, nothing. Just discussion about Watchmen.

1754
02:22:52,580 --> 02:22:54,020
Oh, jeez. Alright.

1755
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:56,420
Oh, well, I saw Watchmen. That was an amazing movie.

1756
02:22:56,420 --> 02:23:01,220
Did you read the comics? I've read the comic. They almost used the

1757
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:04,740
book as a shooting script. Well, I'm kind of disappointed it left out the death of

1758
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:09,860
the first Night Owl, but they had to make room. Well, question for you. Do you think

1759
02:23:09,860 --> 02:23:13,860
the movie ending was better or the comic ending? And don't spoil it because I haven't seen it.

1760
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:18,180
Don't spoil it. Just say which one you prefer. They could not have pulled off the comic ending.

1761
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:22,980
They would have left so many people scratching their heads and to fit the missing writer plot

1762
02:23:22,980 --> 02:23:28,020
into there would have added another hour. The comic ending, the movie ending was so

1763
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:33,780
streamlined and it worked. I honestly think that the movie ending better fits the audience today.

1764
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:38,260
That's my opinion. Yeah. Without going into how hokey the comic one was.

1765
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:45,860
All my friends gave it bad reviews. They went in there expecting like Spider-Man or Dark Knight.

1766
02:23:47,300 --> 02:23:50,660
It's its own own thing. No, this is R-rated, folks.

1767
02:23:51,220 --> 02:23:54,660
The movie ending doesn't make any sense. Yes, it does.

1768
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:56,020
No, it doesn't. Did you read the comics?

1769
02:23:56,020 --> 02:23:59,860
Yes, I did. A difference of opinion.

1770
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:04,900
It doesn't make any sense because. I will go see it and be the tie vote.

1771
02:24:04,900 --> 02:24:08,340
Without trying to explain too much of the ending of the movie.

1772
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:15,380
It's because a certain character is aligned with a certain country and if that certain,

1773
02:24:15,380 --> 02:24:19,780
you know, thing happened, then everyone would blame the certain country and no world peace

1774
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:22,900
would happen. It would just be all everybody against the one country.

1775
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:25,700
Except that it happened within the one country too.

1776
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:27,220
I'm so confused. It doesn't matter though.

1777
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:28,820
Anyway. All right.

1778
02:24:29,620 --> 02:24:33,220
Another discussion. We should do a movie cast.

1779
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:34,260
Someday. Maybe as a one-off.

1780
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:36,100
We should call it ultimate spoiler cast.

1781
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:40,580
All right. Ray, I got to wrap up and let you go so we can wrap up the show,

1782
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:44,980
but thanks so much. And I hope you had a good time on your first call and call again sometime. Okay.

1783
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:47,060
All right. Sweet. I'll call back next week.

1784
02:24:47,060 --> 02:24:49,780
All right. Later. We may not be here next week, but in two weeks.

1785
02:24:50,660 --> 02:24:51,220
All right. Bye.

1786
02:24:51,220 --> 02:24:51,860
All right. Later.

1787
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:56,180
All right. We like first time callers. That's a good note to end on tonight, I think. So

1788
02:24:56,180 --> 02:24:58,900
sorry guys who didn't get through. We're going to close up the Skypline for now.

1789
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:02,740
You can always send us emails, mailbag orange launch, radio.com, or of course we will continue

1790
02:25:02,740 --> 02:25:06,100
to read chat comments throughout the night. We still have some last minute stories, dark soccer.

1791
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:09,220
I'm sorry. We didn't get to you, but Hey, if I hadn't taken that call, it wouldn't have been

1792
02:25:09,220 --> 02:25:12,580
a first time caller. So I wouldn't have been burping.

1793
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:24,820
Okay. So, um, there is a, uh, a marketing stunt that went kind of, uh, nuts and it was, um,

1794
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:30,340
actually by monument PR, um, for Friday the 13th for the launch of resident evil five.

1795
02:25:30,900 --> 02:25:36,660
And the, basically the big stunt was a treasure hunt, um, where about 50, uh,

1796
02:25:36,660 --> 02:25:43,300
members of the public would go and retrieve arms, legs, heads, and torsos from a number of

1797
02:25:43,300 --> 02:25:54,740
different areas. Um, so, um, it was basically, um, part of, you know, like I said, part of the,

1798
02:25:54,740 --> 02:26:01,620
the big campaign. Um, so they, uh, hid all the body parts, um, within the square mile of London,

1799
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:10,500
like, um, in bins and on window ledges and a hundred people signed up. Um, so, um, basically

1800
02:26:12,740 --> 02:26:19,220
it actually said that, um, the people paying attention to it, passers by complained to the

1801
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:25,700
police and officers were there at the finishing line, um, to greet the people who are trying to

1802
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:32,340
assemble bodies. So it's the whole thing. I read about this earlier on the weekend,

1803
02:26:32,340 --> 02:26:36,020
the whole thing sounded stupid and like, it did look kind of gross. Like, you know,

1804
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:40,180
there's just certain things that, you know, you gotta wonder who the hell thought this was a good

1805
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:46,980
idea, right? Maybe it was just me. I don't know. Loki. Well, thank you to our emailer and to Jamie

1806
02:26:46,980 --> 02:26:51,140
for that one. Loki, did you have anything tonight? Uh, just some small stuff. Um,

1807
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:59,540
Watchmen, The End of Nigh 2 has been announced and apparently it is more of the same. However,

1808
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:05,620
um, it's supposed to be a little bit racier. Apparently it's been rated by the ESRB and

1809
02:27:05,620 --> 02:27:12,100
describes, uh, some sexual content in there, including, um, nice. There's a, let's see here.

1810
02:27:13,540 --> 02:27:17,220
Uh, well basically the sexual content, I guess, is the more racier part.

1811
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:22,900
Oh, I don't know the blue peen. Well, that's not necessarily in there. As a watch, I guess you'll,

1812
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:28,580
um, fight in a strip club that includes, uh, go-go dancers in cages, peep show booths,

1813
02:27:28,580 --> 02:27:35,220
and a pornographic film in the background. However, um, in case you haven't played the

1814
02:27:35,220 --> 02:27:40,740
first Watchmen, The End of Nigh, it sucks. And so if it's more of the same, it's more of the suck.

1815
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:50,260
So don't buy it. Or at least try the demo. Um, apparently Peter Moore of EA is saying that

1816
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:57,380
Wii Motion Plus is going to put an end to lazy Wiimote gaming. Um, apparently the 1-1, uh, motion

1817
02:27:57,380 --> 02:28:03,540
capture that is part of, um, Wii Motion Plus requires you to actually make the full swing

1818
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:07,220
when playing a golf game or tennis game. You can't just, like, move your wrists a little bit.

1819
02:28:07,220 --> 02:28:11,620
Which is great, because that'll encourage more people to throw stuff through their TV. Sweet.

1820
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:19,060
Um, now of course we talked about earlier a free PopCap game you can get on St. Patty's Day,

1821
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:22,900
but of course there's going to be some more stuff coming out as well, including Little Big Planet

1822
02:28:22,900 --> 02:28:30,660
is going to be giving away a free, um, St. Patty's Day costume. That'll include a beard,

1823
02:28:30,660 --> 02:28:38,660
a shiny green suit, a green top hat, and other stuff to make your character look like a leprechaun.

1824
02:28:39,380 --> 02:28:45,220
Um, also in April there's going to be another free costume that's a Monkey King costume.

1825
02:28:45,220 --> 02:28:50,340
Apparently it was the winning entry of the PlayStation Asia contest, the design costume

1826
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:55,140
contest. And then there's some more paid costumes coming out later, including a Killzone mini pack,

1827
02:28:55,140 --> 02:29:02,500
Buzz mini pack, Patapon costume, and a Heavenly Sword mini pack as well. But I want some more

1828
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:07,140
damn expansions, that's what I want. More stuff like Metal Gear Solid, because that's awesome.

1829
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:12,420
And then finally, um, Resident Evil 5 is already going to get some download content.

1830
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:20,660
The VS download content, it's been dated in Japan. It's going to be available for, um, 250 yen

1831
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:28,020
and 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live. It is, um, apparently coming out in a few weeks.

1832
02:29:28,740 --> 02:29:35,220
And we'll add in some new online co-op modes, as well as some competitive online options.

1833
02:29:35,220 --> 02:29:40,420
Uh, I guess some four player, um, game modes and stuff like that as well. So that's kind of neat.

1834
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:44,740
And I'm sure it'll be coming out over here around the same time. That is it.

1835
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:50,580
All right. Lots and lots of last minute stuff, but it's been a little bit of a busy week. Well,

1836
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:54,260
we're going to try to wrap things up and get on out of here for the evening. So we got to go

1837
02:29:54,260 --> 02:29:58,740
around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night. Um, brings us to the end of the show.

1838
02:29:58,740 --> 02:30:04,740
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. Your final thought. Blarg. My final thought is Cherry 7-Up

1839
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:09,540
is delicious. And I've had two cans tonight during the show. That can't be healthy. Loki,

1840
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:16,660
your final thought. Um, my final thought is Pagel is fun. All right. That's going to do it. Thank

1841
02:30:16,660 --> 02:30:20,340
you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting independent radio. Remember,

1842
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:23,780
if you like what you hear, we do this for free. We do it for fun. We do it for you.

1843
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:27,860

1845
02:30:34,180 --> 02:30:39,140
maybe next week. Stay tuned to the website for updates on the show. Uh, but for sure in two

weeks, we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. So until then, thank you guys. Have a great
