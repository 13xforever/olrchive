00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that podcast, radio show dedicated to video games

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you every week

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here on All Games Radio

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And joining me as always say hello to the one and only

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yo

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How you doing DarkSakura?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Mmm, interesting

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, interesting?

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Interesting

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, I get interesting good or interesting bad

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because interesting is a very, uh, interesting term

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Interesting neutral

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, fair enough

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Suddenly I feel like we're talking about D&D alignments or something

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're chaotic interesting

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's funny, I took a D&D alignment test

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And I had taken the same one before

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Right

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I came out chaotic good before

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Last time I came out true neutral

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But, you know, feelings change

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How long ago was it that you took the test?

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
About a couple years ago

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
People change, you know

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
People sometimes shift their political ideals

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Over years and years, you know

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
People change

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We change our opinions on games

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I remember a time on this show

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We've been doing this show a long time

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
About seven years, right?

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And I remember a time on this show where it was like

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Xbox was the butt of all our jokes we ever made on this show

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like the ginormous controllers of the original Xbox

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And now Xbox is pretty cool

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think all of us can agree

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
360's got a lot of great stuff on it

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So it's just interesting

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Right, Tech Master Loki?

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And it's also not the size of a house

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How you doing, Tech Master Loki?

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Fine

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah?

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You have a good week?

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, it was a pretty good week

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I understand you finally got to Airsoft today

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, finally

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How was that?

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It was fun

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know, we played like three games

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We played at a different place than normal

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Because I didn't want to drive an hour to where we normally play

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So we played at a field next to my work

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And it was pretty nice

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And there's lots of rocks

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because people might not know

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But Folsom used to be a big mining town

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And, well, they used to dredge and stuff in the river

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And there are piles and piles of cobblestones

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
All over the place out there

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And that's all the ground is, is cobblestones

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thankfully there was some dirt on there

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So it wasn't so bad

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But there's cobblestone hills that we were on top of

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And there's a bunch of eucalyptus trees that they planted there for some reason

81
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So it's like a big jungle out there

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
First person shooters for real, right?

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yep

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I got to try out one of my new guns

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And it's so awesome

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My other guns, my older ones, not so awesome

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And of course there's always you guys who join us here every week

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
On Orange Lounge Radio when we tape live

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And you can join us in our chatroom live chat.orangeloungeradio.com

90

Or on the Game Surge Network for you IRC fans

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
At channel Orange Lounge

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And the first comment tonight from Shadowrunner

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Xbox is awesome until the Red Ring of Death and then it's fail

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Good point

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You know, the Xbox has taken a lot of crap for the Red Ring

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And sure, Microsoft's, you know, kind of done the whole

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oops, our bad, we're going to extend the warranties and all that on that

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But it makes me think of an article, if I can work in a cheap plug here

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
For the new orangeloungeradio.com website

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Which has actually been, you know, thanks to our new writing staff

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Has had a pretty constant stream of new articles

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I got to say it's pretty awesome

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
One of them was written by Bresloll earlier this week

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And he was kind of talking about, is it just me

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Or are these new console systems just not built to last

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Like the old ones

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Like he was kind of saying, you know, I could probably still find a Nintendo that works

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Or a Super Nintendo that works

109
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And come to think of it, you know, I was kind of reading the article

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And, you know, yeah, I don't think I ever, ever had a console break

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Until the Xbox 360

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But then there's also another argument that says, well look

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Consoles broke all the time, you just didn't hear about it

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because now the internet culture, you know, one person's console breaks

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In a, you know, over the top way

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And it hits every game blog on the internet

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And, you know, millions of people read about it

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Kind of different interesting schools of thought

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But, I don't know, you know, old school 8-bit NESs might still work

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But you still have to blow on the cartridge

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And blow in the system to get it to work, you know

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Unless you're lucky enough to have a top loader

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, with the 360, it's basically praying that it's not gonna break

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because, you know, it's like if you look at it funny, it's like

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm gonna die now

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I hope you're happy

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I know, you just kind of hope that it's gonna last, you know, the full three years

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, it's just like the 360 that I fixed that's modded

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm just surprised each day that it works

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Because it's like, there's no reason that this should work, but it is

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Every day is a new gift

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, exactly

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
GS68 in chat says, hey, some of my Super Nintendo games don't work anymore

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Here's what I'm curious about

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Does those batteries, remember how batteries were only supposed to last like five years

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The batteries that they have in like the Zelda games or the battery backup

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Did anybody ever read the fine print that those things were only supposed to last five years

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I wonder, do some of those still work

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I've never heard of those batteries really failing

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
My Zelda cartridge finally died

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Did it really?

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It did

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Also, the same batteries, the lithium batteries are used in the Sega Saturn

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mine have had to be replaced a couple times

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wow

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
BlackWolf, plugging his other show in chat

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We learned on Friday Night Gaming that blowing on the cartridge actually does nothing

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It was the readjusting into the cartridge slot that fixed it

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
See, I always thought it was the moisture that you, when you were blowing on the cartridge

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It was the moisture from your breath that was helping with the contacts

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's what I always thought was the

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The moisture would corrode contact

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, interesting

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We used to just take alcohol swabs

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It all depends on how, what condition your console is in

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know, in your games

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you leave your games out and they're super dusty

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Then blowing in it, I can imagine, would fix that a little bit

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But yeah, usually it was the contacts on the inside that were really dirty

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And thankfully they did have the NES cleaning kit

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And you could, you know, do that and then you see the contacts and they come out all black and you're like, wow

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
One more comment from chat and then we'll get to how was your gaming week

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We have Say in chat says, I've only ever had my PS1 break caught on fire

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't, I would freak the hell out if that ever happened when a gaming system

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Can you imagine a gaming system like catching fire?

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Dude, what did you do with that system?

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Was it like a 48 hour Final Fantasy 7 marathon or something?

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Like how does your system catch fire?

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Or maybe it wasn't properly vented, I don't know

170
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But, you know, because some of those systems

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Or he poured gasoline on it and set it on fire

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't think that would be a, you know, whoops mistake

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know

174
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Alright, let's, breaking these consoles in all these intricate ways makes me think back

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you guys remember the SmashMyWee.com or whatever it was

176
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I could be mistaken

177
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Where they stood in line all night long to buy a Wii

178
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Only so they could break it

179
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, they'd be there all the time

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The novelty is worn off

181
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What a bunch of assholes, yeah the novelty is worn off

182
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Now what they should do though

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I totally approve of this

184
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is like smash my scion or something

185
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Something more expensive that it takes a while to smash this

186
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You know, like you can actually do some serious damage to it

187
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Because, you know, and what they do is get people to donate money so that they can go smash it

188
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why are we allowing these people to have the fun of smashing something

189
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You know, I want to be able to smash something for free

190
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Wow, and Sage just followed up in chat, it was some 24 hour thing

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, there you go

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Alright, let's get to how was your gaming week

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week, what kind of games did you play this week

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I played Ragnarok online and that's about it

195
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Getting back into the Ragnarok, huh

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Off and on, I've really been spending a lot more time doing, reorganizing our video game collection at my house

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Which is actually what my husband is doing right now

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We have a lot of games, a lot of games

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Didn't you upload some of the pictures to our picture feed, I thought

200
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Just one of the stacks, and that's like a small part of the vault

201
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We've actually moved out a lot of our boxes into the garage and are going through everything

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And Dan found all of our Guilty Gear figures today

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And a few Mega Drive cartridges and stuff

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Awesome

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I found our copy of Policenauts

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Wow, that's random

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hey, I got a question, I haven't asked this in a while, what ever happened with Ragnarok 2, I haven't heard anything on that in a while

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Did that ever like release

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't care

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You weren't a fan

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Still in beta, I don't care

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
After all this time, it's been like beta for like two years

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
How long was the first Ragnarok in beta

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I guess that's true

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You played with me in the beta

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I remember, yeah, it was a long time ago

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
With your mage with a bow

218
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Deathwishing in chat at chat.org.com says Ragnarok is way too confusing

219
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What do you think this guy is doing wrong

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Maybe he didn't translate the game yet, I don't know

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Is it confusing, is it hard to get into

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Is it about Ragnarok 2 or the first one

223
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No, the first one

224
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The first one is not at all confusing

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's really easy

226
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I mean, it's just a matter of using common sense and combining your skills and what matches what you want to do

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If you want to be a fighter, you can either go strong, tough, or fast

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But it's also a different kind of game, right

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Because if you go to this game after playing something like, I don't know, Warcraft, it's different

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's easier

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Ragnarok Online is infinitely easier than World of Warcraft

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But the thing that I think that people don't like about it is that you don't have someone holding your hand and allocating your points for you

233
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Maybe it's because they expect you to fucking use your brain to allocate your points

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You know

235
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Alright

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Am I right or am I right?

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's been so long since I've played, I honestly can't tell you

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't even remember how the damn game works

239
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I remember the porings were really cute, that's what I remember

240
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
World of Warcraft

241
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, I wouldn't say it necessarily hand holds you and how to distribute your point

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But here's the thing, Warcraft is so infinitely popular

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You can go onto websites upon websites to tell you how to build your character

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And then you get these, you know, elitist raiders that if you don't shape your character a certain way, then you are suck

245
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But in the end, it's all basically your armor

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Or the stuff you've got on you that controls it

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In Ragnarok, it's if you kill creature, creature, creature

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You can go put all of it in your intelligence and have a mage, you know

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Intelligence and dex

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you want, like say if you're playing an assassin

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You put it all in your agility, a little bit in strength and a lot of it in dex

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And boom, you can hit and hit a lot

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So, you know, and on top of that, your armor and your accessories are all in addition to what you do

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So it's not really that confusing, you just have to know what you want

255
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Blackwolf in chat, if I wanted to use my brain, I wouldn't rot them away playing a video game

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He says with a little hint of sarcasm

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I played loss and damage

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And that's it

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Just multiplayer, I didn't get around to doing much of anything

261
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm trying to figure out why that was

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh yeah, I remember now

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Because I was trying to hack the loss and damage and it's fucking hard

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So, yeah

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So no luck there

266
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Because apparently they have these SHA-1 hashes in a file

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And if you change one byte of the file, it changes the whole hash

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So you have to figure out where they need to be updated and for what blocks

269
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's so complicated that it just fries my brain thinking about it

270
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But I want to do it because you can edit it just like the PC

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Because it has the same format and stuff, so that'll be fun

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But yeah, that's pretty much that

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And then I did find my DS Lite finally

274
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Buried amongst the stuff that was on my coffee table

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And so I kind of went through there and I'm going to be playing some games on that now

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So, hopefully I'll have a little bit more to play

277
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And I know next week for sure I'm going to have some stuff to play

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm getting from work a Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Killzone 2

279
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Not that I'm really excited about it because I don't give a shit about Resident Evil

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But I'll play it anyways or whatever

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Killzone 2 looks interesting, I wasn't going to buy it though

282
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So thank god I don't have to pay for it

283
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But Mad World, holy shit, I can't wait to play that game

284
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So that'll be one I'll be playing next week

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But lots of fun stuff coming up

286
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
My gaming week, I didn't have time to play a whole lot

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I did check out Quake Live for a brief little bit

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Now that the queues apparently aren't such an issue

289
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The first couple of days you try to get in there

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You had these queues that were thousands of people long

291
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's just like, yeah right, you're not going to get in there

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But finally I snuck in there one night and got to play

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Because I think they finally eliminated the queues

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Or really opened up the servers or something

295
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Or the fever just died down, so it's really easy to get in there now

296
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So I did play for a little bit

297
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was surprised because I don't know why

298
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But I was under the impression that Quake Live was a new version of the original Quake

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's not, it's based off Quake 3

300
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Even the same voice and all that stuff

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So I was pleasantly surprised

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I like how it does that skill match in the beginning

303
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
In the very beginning when you sign onto Quake Live

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You have to play a 10 minute match against a computer opponent

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That gets a little harder as you start kicking her butt

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And then it gets a little easier if she starts killing you a lot

307
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So it's supposed to skill match you with other opponents

308
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So considering the whole thing is free

309
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's definitely worth checking out

310
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If I suck really bad on that then I could play really hardcore against noobs

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I would think so, but I would think that as you do that

312
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Your skill rating is going to go up

313
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So you don't get to do that for very long

314
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I would imagine there's people

315
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So I actually tried

316
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Because I was thinking, oh I should just suck at this

317
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I can just get matched against really easy players

318
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So I can feel better about myself

319
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But then I thought no, because there's going to be a lot of other people thinking that same thing

320
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So I'm going to just actually try

321
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Because I know I'm not that great at Quake

322
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And it was an even match between me and the computer opponent

323
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So it was just kind of fun

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And some comments from chat

325
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Tigerclaw says, Quake Live also works in full screen

326
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And that's true, Quake Live does run pretty well in full screen

327
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Tigerclaw says, it's Quake 3 minus the blood and gore

328
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah, the blood's missing and all that stuff

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But again, it's all free in the browser

330
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's very hard to complain

331
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I had a good time with Quake Live

332
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The little time I spent with it

333
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I want to go back and revisit it

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I also played some Rock Band 2

335
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Because I love me some Rock Band

336
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I spend an obscene amount of money on new songs

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know why I waste my money like that, but I do

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I was like, oh, I have to play No Doubt and New

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And I really want to play White Zombie

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I have two drum sets and I use neither of them

341
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh my gosh

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Maybe I should borrow one

343
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I need to get my drum achievements

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know

345
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I've got one, it's the wireless one with the cymbals

346
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I have the cymbals for it

347
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Really?

348
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, and they're kind of, eh

349
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I might have to

350
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And I have a drum bag, or a bag to carry the drums

351
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I was thinking about getting that little portable one

352
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't know how well they work

353
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't get that

354
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Is it terrible?

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It looks like crap

356
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, I don't know, but I like the idea that it doesn't take up all this freaking space in my house

357
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You know, you kind of just put it out on the table and play

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Seriously, if you got a bag for the drums

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The one that they actually make for it

360
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It doesn't take up that much space at all

361
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's like a small suitcase

362
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And you can just put it down somewhere

363
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I have my one set broken down in that

364
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And then I have my other one that if I were to play Rock Band

365
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I would use that set, but

366
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
They're both at work

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So I don't, you know, because I've run out of space in my house

368
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And here's the other thing

369
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Also in my gaming week

370
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I downloaded the demo for The Last Remnant

371
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But I haven't checked it out yet, so

372
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know why I mentioned it

373
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But I'm going to check that out this next week

374
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because I'm curious

375
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If it's really, really good, I might just get it on 360

376
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I'm also kind of curious how it's going to run on PC

377
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And then also

378
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I wanted to go back and play Civilization 4

379
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Because, you know, after video games live and everything

380
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And seeing the little slideshow

381
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I was like, oh, I need to get back into Civilization and play this game again

382
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So I remembered it was on GameTap

383
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So I went to GameTap and found it in their library

384
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And tried to launch Civilization 4

385
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It doesn't work

386
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Because it doesn't work in Windows Vista

387
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And come to find out, quite a few of their games don't work in Windows Vista

388
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Also come to find out, GameTap's going through some major changes

389
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
In the next couple weeks

390
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
As they kind of shift to their new ownership or whatever

391
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Whatever, I got this email about new pricing arrangements or whatever

392
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And, you know, I'm locked into their current ones

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So I'm not going to get shifted or whatever

394
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But I don't know if I really like the direction GameTap's heading

395
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I have to be honest

396
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You know, as a fair critic

397
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't know if I necessarily like

398
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I can't really judge until it happens

399
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But now they have this whole thing where the arcade games

400
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Are going to actually be playable in the browser window

401
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And, you know, some of the classic games

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And now some of the other stuff

403
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Like, they're kind of turning into this hybrid of Steam

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And, like, what sounds to me like Pogo games

405
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And, like, I don't want to pay for Pogo games

406
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You know what I mean?

407
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So, I don't know

408
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm going to withhold my full judgement

409
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Until it comes out

410
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But, I don't know, I'm just not happy either

411
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That, like, some of these things just won't work in Vista

412
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And I understand the games are old

413
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
They were made for a certain Windows system

414
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's my fault for being stupid and having Vista

415
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But, look, that's what my computer came with

416
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So that's all I have

417
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I keep seeing advertisements for good old gaming

418
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's a, I don't know if it's a website

419
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's like Steam or something

420
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But they have, you know, older games in there advertising

421
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Rise of the Triad on there and stuff

422
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So I think that's kind of neat

423
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That they have the old games

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If they would run or not

425
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Because I know Duke Nukem 3D, for example

426
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Won't run on, you know, XP

427
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Unless you've got, you know, something special for it

428
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So, I don't know

429
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Dr. Tetsuya in chat says

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I agree, we haven't used it in a long time

431
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Especially since they're all about PC ports nowadays

432
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Now, you know, call me stupid if you want

433
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't care

434
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I made an impulse buy a few months ago

435
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Not that you've ever made impulse buys, Loki

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I bought a full year of GameTap up front

437
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I'm locked into this thing for a year

438
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Whether I like it or not

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So, at least, you know, I'll have a chance to give it a full review

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And maybe it'll win me over

441
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I just don't like what I'm hearing, that's all

442
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So, you know, I kind of look at these changes

443
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I go, oh boy, alright, I'm going to have to see this in motion

444
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But, you know, I guess in the end it is all about the games

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And if they can make it so that Civ 4 will magically work in Windows Vista

446
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know what they have to do

447
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I imagine if they emulate all these old games, there's got to be a way to do it

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Civ 4 is not, like, an obscure game

449
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Couldn't you run it, like, say in the compatibility mode with XP or something like that?

450
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Run GameTap?

451
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Possibly, I haven't looked into how it works

452
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, I finally got to

453
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Maybe there's a listener that's thinking, Rob, you're so stupid

454
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There is totally a way you get it to work in Windows Vista

455
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But then again, shouldn't GameTap just kind of be able to tell me that?

456
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
How about compatibility mode?

457
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I just said that

458
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, I don't know

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Well, I finally got to use Vista

460
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, I had my wife's co-worker want me to find her some stuff to put onto her system

461
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You know, all legit software, of course

462
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So, I hate Vista. It sucks really bad

463
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's just, the hand-holding stuff really pisses me off

464
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I disagree

465
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't know, I'm iffy on it

466
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
These compatibility type issues make me a little irked with Vista

467
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I think I'm more looking forward to the new Windows than I am

468
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm kind of like, uh, Vista's a stepping stone for me

469
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't like Vista now

470
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
My system is completely tailored around running it

471
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So, that's just how it was when I bought it

472
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So, it runs like a dream on my computer

473
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah, it's fast

474
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I mean, on my computer, it's well optimized and everything

475
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But it's just, I don't know

476
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I disabled all the touchscreen stuff because it was fucking with my tablet

477
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And I disabled a few things here and there

478
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But then again, I've always tweaked XP to get it to run how I want it to

479
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I tweak every OS I get my hands on to make it run the way I want it to

480
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And guess what? Right now, my Vista runs like XP with a few goodies

481
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But I bet you wouldn't be able to play Civ IV either

482
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Actually, I probably would be able to

483
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If you can get it to work, let me know

484
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
City of Heroes gave me compatibility issues and I just changed it to run in compatibility mode

485
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And boom, no problem

486
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'll check it out, maybe it is something that simple and I'm just being stupid

487
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
All it did was change my resolution

488
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's certainly a possibility

489
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And then it changes it back when it's done

490
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Alright, we'll see

491
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll try it, I'll try it

492
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll try to dig into compatibility mode

493
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And then I'll get all those emails this week, you idiot, it was super easy

494
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And then GameTap will email me, you idiot, stop talking negative about our service and you can't figure it out

495
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But at the same time, I would think

496
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If GameTap is going to give me an error message about not being able to start the game

497
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It should tell me, hey, you should think about running in compatibility mode

498
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Of course it could have been right in front of my face and I was just too pissed off not to see it

499
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Anyhow

500
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Alright, let's get into

501
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, next link in chat says I have Civ IV and I run it off Vista

502
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So I don't know

503
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, we'll see

504
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I can fully admit, look, I'm not the biggest computer genius in the world

505
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I can just get Civ IV, you know, so that you could play it without GameTap

506
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Maybe that's what I'll be forced to do

507
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Because I will feel that sense of entitlement

508
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's right

509
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Not stealing

510
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
GameTap forced you

511
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They forced you into this, okay

512
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Alright

513
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's move on with the show

514
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We have some housekeeping to get into

515
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And then we're going to get into tonight's show

516
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hey, I'm over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com right now live tonight during the show

517
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Orange Lounge Radio March Madness The Elite 8 is wrapping up right now

518
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And check that out

519
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You can vote

520
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
There's some pretty epic matchups going on in the top 8 right now

521
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Final Fantasy VI vs Chrono Trigger

522
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Before the show tonight, Chrono Trigger was leading

523
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But, you know, a lot can change

524
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's a pretty epic matchup

525
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So you can go vote in that

526
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And the Final Four will be announced a little later tonight after the show

527
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And keep an eye on OrangeLoungeRadio.com for that throughout the week

528
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Also, we have some more people writing on OrangeLoungeRadio.com

529
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And now we have some new segments that showed up out of the blue that I'm loving

530
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I heart that song

531
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They've actually kind of been, I guess, using the classic game of the week a little bit as an inspiration

532
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Some of our staff writers have been writing these tributes to great songs in gaming

533
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Which has been kind of cool

534
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And, you know, just some other great segments on OrangeLoungeRadio.com

535
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Very happy with the direction the new site's going

536
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Alright, I guess that's it for housekeeping

537
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't forget, you know, LiveJournal, Facebook, MySpace, all that good stuff

538
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki

539
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Well, there's interesting stuff coming out from Microsoft

540
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You may remember last year during August that they did the, what was it, Summer of Arcade

541
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It was a promotion where they had a bunch of really cool arcade games coming out back to back

542
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You know, each week there'd be a really highly anticipated Xbox Live Arcade game

543
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Well, I don't know if this is exactly the same type of thing

544
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But they're doing one that's going to start on March 18th

545
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's the Days of Arcade promotion

546
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't know why they couldn't have done Spring of Arcade

547
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But Days of Arcade

548
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And similar to the event that happened last year

549
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They're going to have a bunch of different games coming out

550
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Starting with the release of Hasbro Family Game Night

551
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And if I remember correctly, I think Hasbro Family Game Night is actually like five different games

552
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah, it is. It's like Sari and a bunch of the old classic games

553
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So I don't know if on the 18th they're going to get like five games all of a sudden

554
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
But whatever

555
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Also coming out will be the Dishwasher Dead Samurai

556
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Which, if you remember, was that really kickass XNA game

557
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Finally now an actual game

558
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Flock, which was Capcom's kind of sheep herding type of game

559
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Outrun Online Arcade, which is pretty awesome

560
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Puzzle Quest Galact...

561
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Like Old School Sega Outrun?

562
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yes, like Outrun

563
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Could be fun

564
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Puzzle Quest Galactrix

565
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Uno Rush

566
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And Lode Runner

567
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Those all sound pretty awesome, actually

568
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You know, I don't know though, I don't get the same thrill out of Hasbro Family Game Night

569
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That I did out of like Geometry Wars 2

570
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And some of the things that came out in the summer

571
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But I understand

572
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Xbox has a family friendly niche they need to fill pretty badly to compete with Nintendo

573
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So I'm okay with it, I understand why they need stuff like that

574
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It all depends on what games

575
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I can't remember what they had in the Hasbro Family Game Night

576
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
If they actually had, you know...

577
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Battleship might be fun

578
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Well also look, what's like the number one Xbox Live Arcade game

579
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
After all this time, like Uno

580
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Maybe not number one, I have nothing to back that up

581
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But it's still like in the top five at least

582
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
After all this time, Uno is still there

583
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You know, tons of people still play Uno

584
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So you can't say that there's not a demand for something like this

585
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Especially if it's well done, so you know

586
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And the Hasbro Family Game Night sells really well in every other system that it's out on

587
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So I can see that

588
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah, I can see it too

589
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
There's a lot of love being lavished upon Galaga Legion in our chat room

590
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Son of Dad says Galaga Legion was the best last year

591
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Sonic M88, I loved Galaga Legion

592
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That was a pretty good release in the last batch too

593
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
No I didn't actually... I think I downloaded that

594
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm not sure if I bought it or not, but

595
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I downloaded it and played the demo, it was pretty cool

596
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But that was like right around the same time that I also got Space Invaders Extreme on my PSP

597
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And I just kind of ended up playing that instead

598
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah

599
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I think didn't Duke Nukem 3D come out during that time too?

600
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I think it did

601
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah, I think that was one of the big releases too

602
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, that was another one like Doom where I was like

603
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Oh my god, it's Doom!

604
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And it played multiplayer online like once

605
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And I was like, okay I'm going on to other things now

606
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But aren't they making a Galaga Legion 2?

607
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Didn't we have a story on the show a few weeks ago about that?

608
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That they're doing a second one?

609
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't know about that

610
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Some type of other reiteration of Galaga?

611
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I don't know

612
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It would be pretty awesome if they did

613
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Hey, the Xbox Elite is being phased out apparently

614
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This is the rumor going around the internet this week

615
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Apparently the Xbox 360 is going to be more of like a limited edition type of console

616
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's not going to be so readily available

617
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's because retailers are not as happy about the Elite apparently

618
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You know, the economy the way it is

619
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
A system that costs what, $200 more than the entry level system

620
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's not doing too well

621
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So apparently Microsoft might actually be limiting the console sales

622
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
To only select retailers across North America and Europe

623
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Apparently the Elite might just phase out altogether in Quarter 2

624
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, I don't know about that

625
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I mean, at least as far as when I'm selling it

626
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
We have tons of it on hand

627
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So it won't be going away anytime soon

628
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But I know they do

629
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And some thought is that maybe they're phasing this out in favor of

630
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The Elites will be out for the Resident Evil 5 Red Box Elite system

631
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And then when that phases away and the next big Xbox game comes out

632
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
There'll be a limited edition system for that

633
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
They could be treating it like Sony's doing with their higher end systems

634
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Like the 160GB system now that's bundled with the game

635
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
They may be doing that

636
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And I can see, because right now the Elite by itself doesn't seem like a great deal

637
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But when you have the Resident Evil Elite there

638
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You get an arcade game and you also get a game with it for the same price

639
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So that seems a little bit better of a deal to me

640
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And yeah, I can totally see them doing a Halo ODST game

641
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And bundle and I don't know what other games they have coming out in the pipeline here

642
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I know this is such a cliche bitch about the Xbox 360

643
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But how about a quiet edition console?

644
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I might pay an extra $100 for a freaking quiet Xbox 360

645
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean, especially compared to the Playstation 3

646
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Which, you know, obviously it has its own shortcomings

647
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But one thing, it's freaking quiet

648
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's why you install games to your hard drive

649
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Even when you do that, you still hear the vroom

650
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You don't hear the drive spin up

651
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But the machine itself is incredibly loud

652
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Well, it's either that or it red rings on you because it overheats

653
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Would you rather it be loud or would you rather it be dead?

654
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I would rather they just fix the problem and redo the console or whatever

655
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You know, Sony does it with the PS2 and the PS1

656
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You can hack in there and manually change the voltage of your fan

657
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I shouldn't have to hack

658
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
They should just do it

659
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And then it'll be nice and cook food on it and stuff

660
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I don't know

661
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Open the case on it and take the fans out, I don't know

662
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I don't want to break the damn thing

663
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I just want it to shut the hell up sometimes

664
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Because it's kind of loud

665
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
They should make a fan case that would go over the loudest parts

666
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Or something, or a noise filter, I don't know

667
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Maybe you should find some sort of noise trapping material

668
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Like some sort of...

669
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Like how metal would reflect a rubber mat or something

670
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
To put underneath it

671
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Or maybe finding a different type of...

672
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Some cabinets that you can put your systems in

673
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Actually can put a glass window in front of it

674
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
With just the little thing for the cords and that kind of filters out the sound

675
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I don't know

676
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Or you get the integrated audio video setup

677
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Where it's actually a plug in your wall

678
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And you put another one in another room

679
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And then you put your system in the other room

680
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Since the wireless controllers can reach within 30 feet

681
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Then you go, it's another room and you don't have to hear it

682
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Or I could just fucking deal with it as I have to

683
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes, that's definitely the way to go

684
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But then I can't hear the game

685
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Or I could get headphones

686
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah, that's another thing, headphones are good

687
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Or you set it next to a PC that's even louder

688
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And then it doesn't matter

689
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Like the Orange Lounge Radio PC

690
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Oh, that's nothing compared to...

691
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I don't know if you can hear the monster fan on this thing

692
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It is... I have the loudest...

693
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Have you seen my PC?

694
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Not in a long time

695
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
With its 200mm fan on top of it

696
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And it's got like, you know

697
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
8 different fans that are on it

698
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Plus there's 3 more inside the case

699
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Plus there's a fan on each of the graphics cards

700
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That are also hacked to be 100% all the time

701
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's like a jet engine

702
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Alright, I don't want to bitch about noise anymore

703
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
People are probably sick of it

704
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But I do want to read a comment from chatroom

705
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Because this made me lull a little bit

706
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
The comment from chat was from SonOfDad

707
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Says, Hannah Montana Xbox 360 Elite Skew for me please

708
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
PSP's doing it

709
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
There you go

710
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Baby, baby poop purple

711
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Xbox 360

712
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
If you want to join us in our chatroom

713
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000

714
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Well you know, Rob, that her new movie

715
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
She's gonna have to choose

716
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Whether she's gonna be Miley Cyrus or Hannah Montana

717
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
How about she chooses to go jump in a lake

718
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That would be...

719
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Or deaf

720
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
She's deaf

721
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Amazing

722
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Alright

723
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
If I can't be both then I won't be any deaf

724
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'll just have to chop myself in half

725
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Alright

726
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Let's move on with more gaming news please

727
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Do not let Loki ruin my show with Hannah Montana

728
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Dear God no

729
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Well how about something that I'm sure a lot of people have been waiting for

730
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Rob, maybe you've been waiting for this, I don't know

731
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
What's that?

732
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The Beatles on Rock Band

733
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Actually it's the Beatles Rock Band Edition

734
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
A collaboration between Apple Corps, Harmonic, and MTV Games

735
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And it's going to be all Beatles music

736
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
They're basically saying that they don't have any plans yet for downloadable content

737
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But it is going to be stand alone, dedicated, just to the Beatles

738
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So no importing your songs into other rock band games or any of that stuff is what it seems to imply

739
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It's going to be all by itself

740
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Which you know, it's the Beatles, they can do that

741
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They're like the biggest band ever

742
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Ever

743
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And if you doubt this, of course I'm excited about a Beatles rock band game

744
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I mean especially more so than some of these other bands

745
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We've heard Metallica, Aerosmith, I'm sorry they're not the Beatles

746
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
They're good bands in their own way but I'm not as excited about that as the Beatles

747
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Songs have lasted forever, sorry

748
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Actually you're also going to be doing a limited edition premium bundle for $250

749
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
On all platforms, that would be Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii

750
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
That will have instruments modeled after the ones that the band actually played

751
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So hey, that might mean Hofner bass

752
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That's a little excessive for me

753
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I wouldn't get it but I can see where collectors and hardcore Beatles fans would be all over that crap

754
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So that's not a surprise

755
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
For me, I just want the game

756
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But that's good for that audience, that they're doing something like that

757
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But yeah, I think this game is going to be pretty epic in that regard

758
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And if you doubt that the Beatles are still huge

759
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
One site I finally started using again this past week was last.fm

760
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I know we have an Orange Islands Radio group on last.fm

761
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
If you haven't seen it, it's linked from our site

762
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But I finally re-signed up for this site because I was trying to discover some new music

763
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And if you look at the top bands that are played on last.fm

764
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
The Beatles are still there in the top ten

765
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And that's all the music out of anywhere

766
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So if you doubt that the Beatles are still huge

767
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You're wrong

768
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But Miley Cyrus is bigger

769
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
No, Miley Cyrus is not bigger

770
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
At least according to last.fm

771
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Granted, not everybody on the planet uses last.fm

772
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But it certainly

773
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
$250 seems an awful lot of money for, I don't know, Beatles rock band stuff

774
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I mean, am I going to get part of some of the Beatles corpses in there?

775
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Or the hair that you used to get, that they used to sell

776
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
No, I can understand why it's going to command a higher price

777
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Because they can get away with it

778
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
There's going to be people that are willing to pay it for the Beatles

779
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I just probably won't be one of them

780
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But I'm still excited about the game

781
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Did you hear the controversy on how people think that the Wii version is going to be $59.99 for just the software only?

782
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
They're like, $59.99? What the hell?

783
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Everything is only $50!

784
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
That is the cap for Wii games

785
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Not $59.99, it's $49.99

786
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Says who?

787
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Well, says the world

788
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I don't know

789
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I think back a long, long time ago on the Super Nintendo to when Street Fighter II came out

790
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
If I remember right, I could be wrong

791
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But if I remember right, Street Fighter II when it first came out was like $79.99 on the Super Nintendo

792
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That was, I mean, and this was years ago

793
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This isn't counting for inflation, granted in the current economy

794
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I think we're back to where we were when that game came out

795
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But all that aside, you know, $79.99 was a lot of money

796
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And it certainly was more money than you were seeing for other games at the time

797
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I believe a lot of Super Nintendo games at the time were going for the $49.59

798
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
No, I think they were like $39 or $49 back then

799
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But I remember Street Fighter II especially was very expensive

800
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Maybe it was only $69.99

801
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I just remember it was much more expensive

802
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But it was Street Fighter II!

803
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Who didn't want to buy that game back in that day when that first came out?

804
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I honestly don't think it's going to come out for $59.99

805
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I think that's actually a misprint

806
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
But whatever, people are going to stick with it for now

807
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And they'll have a big controversy

808
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But I don't see a lot of people picking it up for $60 if that's the case

809
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Even if it is the Beatles, because who gives a shit?

810
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's the Beatles

811
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I know I'm not picking it up

812
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I don't give a shit about the Beatles, so whatever

813
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
A couple chatters are correcting saying it was $69.99

814
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Maybe there's, I'm thinking like $70 in my mind

815
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Rama says Sky at Toys R Us it was $69

816
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Local Shops had it for $79

817
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And Game Guru says it was $69.99

818
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Son of Dad said it was $69.99 at KB Toys

819
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't know how you guys remember that

820
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Or if you just looked it up on the internet real quick

821
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But still, still, they don't charge $69.99 for games now

822
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I can't think of any games that aren't collector's editions that go for that price

823
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So you know, I'm just saying

824
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Who's to say they can't charge whatever they want for the game

825
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
If they know it's going to be in high demand

826
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And that people are willing to pay that for

827
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You know, what is arguably going to be a premium game

828
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I mean it's not like we're talking about

829
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You know, Carnival Games 2

830
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Trying to command a price of $59.99

831
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
We're talking about the frickin' Beatles

832
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So, you know, I don't know

833
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I won't buy it for the Wii

834
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Why are you talking crap about Carnival Games 2?

835
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I don't know

836
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I want to know

837
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm not talking crap

838
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm just saying I won't pay $69.99 for it

839
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Carnival Games 2, it's worth that kind of money

840
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Interesting comment from Marissa Cungusto in the chat

841
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And I know that's the lovely Marissa

842
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Who hasn't been on our show in a long time

843
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But I think she needs to grace us with her presence again sometimes

844
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
True Beatles fans are more nuts about the music than gimmicks

845
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But people do get nuts

846
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Look at all the Elvis crap

847
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Interesting perspective

848
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Alright, let's move on

849
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
By the way, the release date of this game, 9-9-9

850
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Ten years after the release of the Dreamcast

851
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
What a fun day to release stuff

852
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And I believe, as I was hearing on a Bobby show earlier tonight

853
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
One of their chatters said something

854
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Final Fantasy VIII was out on that same day too

855
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So September 9th is a fun day

856
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Really?

857
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
9-9-9

858
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Final Fantasy VIII was out on that day too

859
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
No, I think it was out on September 9th of a different year

860
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's not the same

861
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's not quite the same

862
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Anyways, so there's another rumor

863
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Honestly, this isn't actually a rumor

864
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I've seen it

865
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Activision is preparing to release Guitar Hero Van Halen

866
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Later this year

867
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
August, to be exact

868
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And it will be coming out, of course, with some of the more popular Van Halen tracks

869
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You know, Jump, Panama, Hot for Teacher

870
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And also other bands' music are gonna be in there

871
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Just like the Metallica stuff and Aerosmith

872
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
How can you have Jump without keyboards?

873
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
How?

874
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I don't get that

875
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
How can you do that without keyboards?

876
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I mean, I know, but I always thought of Jump as a keyboard song

877
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
In fact, there's a local store in town

878
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't remember if it was Guitar Center or Skip's or one of those stores

879
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You had the keyboards all on display at the store, right?

880
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But they had these big songs that the following songs are banned

881
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Do not play them on these keyboards or we will kick you out of the store

882
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
One of them was Jump

883
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You couldn't play the chords

884
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Like you couldn't play it, like that and for release

885
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And all the other stuff

886
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Like they would kick you out of the store if you played that

887
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That's hilarious

888
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
It reminds me of that scene from Wayne's World

889
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
No stairway, tonight

890
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Exactly, it totally reminded me of that

891
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
No stairway, denied

892
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
No chopsticks, I know chopsticks had to be one of them

893
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Other stuff, other songs that might be in there as well

894
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Juice Priest's Painkiller, Tenacious D's Master Exploder

895
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Which you might remember was from Rock Band 2

896
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And Weezer's Dope Nose

897
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Of course, this is all to be taken as rumor right now

898
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But no, it's not a rumor, it's actually coming out

899
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's gonna be just like Guitar Hero, Metallica

900
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So expect that later on this year

901
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
However, that is not all that you can expect later on this year

902
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Cause that's one of the millions of different Guitar Hero games that are coming out this year

903
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Well actually Hero games

904
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Including the previously announced Guitar Hero Modern Hits

905
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Also supposedly this year, Guitar Hero 5 or whatever they're gonna call it

906
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Band Hero, how that is any different than Guitar Hero 5 is beyond me

907
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Another Guitar Hero on tour game for the DS and DJ Hero

908
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I guess they weren't kidding when they were talking about the whole 5 Guitar Hero games in a year or something like that

909
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I think it's a little overkill if you ask me

910
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But I know I'm not buying any of these, except for DJ Hero maybe

911
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That's a maybe

912
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Marissa in chat again says it's true about Stairway, try playing it in Guitar Center

913
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't doubt it, I'm sure they would get very angry at having to hear that song

914
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's just like I hear on American Idol, certain songs are banned from the auditions too

915
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like you can't sing Alicia Keys' Falling in your audition

916
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't know why I know that, I must have read it on Wikipedia or something

917
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Robert M on the last story makes it funny about the release date of the Beatles Rock Band game

918
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
The Beatles Rock Band release date, number 9, number 9, number 9

919
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It's kind of a real nerdy joke there

920
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's also the same day as The Nine is released by Tim Burton

921
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Which looks awesome

922
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Is that a game or a movie?

923
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's going to be a movie and a game

924
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Oh of course, I had to ask, of course if it's a big movie it's going to be a game as well

925
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I thought the next Tim Burton movie was the Alice in Wonderland movie

926
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
No, the Nine is the next one

927
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Unless Alice in Wonderland, I don't think Alice is coming out this year

928
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
No I think it's out in 2010

929
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I love Alice in Wonderland and all that stuff, I'm really excited about the new movie

930
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Anyway, more Guitar Hero

931
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And this is a follow up to a story we reported on a couple, probably a few months ago at this point

932
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm sure our FUs of the Week came right after this particular story

933
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Do you remember when Gibson sued the makers of Guitar Hero?

934
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:59,000
That's right, Gibson had sued over the whole patent they had on musicians simulating participation in a concert

935
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And all this stuff, like they tried to claim basically that they invented Guitar Hero

936
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Even though Guitar Hero worked with them to make the controllers or what have you

937
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Well guess what?

938
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It was lost, their patent suit was lost

939
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And essentially was practically laughed out of court

940
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Is what happened with that

941
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Let's see, this was from the US District Court for the Central District of California

942
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Let's see, the court said it's toys that represent other items there

943
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Also apparently Gibson's patent only originally applied to devices which use the analog audio signals

944
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Not MIDI signals or any other types of control signals

945
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So, there it is

946
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Suck it Gibson

947
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah, it was a little bit silly of them in the first place as we discussed previously

948
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But I guess you could say justice was served

949
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I guess you could say they hacked the Gibson

950
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Aha, aha, aha, give me that

951
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Sad trombone

952
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Well, while we're on the subject of the guitar games, whatever

953
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Guitar Hero Greatest Hits will be out in June

954
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And should have 48 songs, including Them Bones by Alice in Chains, Killer Queen

955
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Killing in the Name, Through the Fire and the Flames

956
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's basically pulling songs from the other Guitar Hero games and putting them in one game

957
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I guess the only cool thing about this is that now they're gonna get the band treatment

958
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Like I was reading somewhere that Through the Fire and the Flames is supposed to have crazy hard drums on it

959
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
To match the crazy hard guitar part

960
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But still

961
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I wanna play the vocals for that

962
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Still, if you listen carefully, listen carefully

963
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And you might be able to hear the sounds of this franchise getting milked to death

964
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Cause that's what's happening, I mean really

965
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It's a slurping noise

966
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That's like, okay, the other day I was looking on iTunes

967
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And they have like greatest hits for like Wilson Phillips

968
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Wilson Phillips had what, like two big songs and two CDs

969
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Does this really necessitate a greatest hits album?

970
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That's how I feel about this whole Guitar Hero thing

971
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Is there really enough out there that necessitates this Guitar Hero Greatest Hits album?

972
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
How about this for more milking, Rob? It's gonna be out on Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, and PS2

973
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm not surprised though, all the Guitar Hero stuff is milked on all the systems

974
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But seriously, it's amazing, you go into stores now, like Fries and Best Buy

975
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There's an entire aisle practically dedicated to these games now

976
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And I mean it's because they sell, obviously

977
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And because they're huge, like literally the boxes are huge

978
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
One day though, one day the bottom's gonna fall out from this market

979
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It's gonna be kinda sad

980
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And it's gonna be Activision's fault

981
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Don't be like Konami, don't hoard DDR

982
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I just, you know, again, at least bring a keyboard or something like that

983
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And Rama says in chat, Sky, if Rick Astley can have a greatest hits album, so can Wilson Phillips

984
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Good statement, good statement

985
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
That could possibly be the chat comment of the evening, we'll see

986
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Alright, let's get into some release dates from around the world, lowkey

987
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Alright, well in the US, we have a few games coming out this week

988
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Starting off with Stuff for the Wii

989
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
We've got New Play Control Pikmin and New Play Control Mario Tennis

990
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Slightly old but yet new

991
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
My Pet Shop for the Nintendo DS, which is being released by Taito

992
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And features Mama from Cooking Mama

993
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Except now she's working in a pet shop

994
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Is there anything Mama can fix?

995
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I don't want to know

996
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I need Mama to fix my life

997
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I don't know, maybe she's hunting for ingredients

998
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
We need Relationship Mama, that's what I need

999
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I need Mama to fix my dating life

1000
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
That's what I want, no I'm kidding

1001
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It's a weird game with some giant mushroom, I don't know

1010
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Can we say that again?

1011
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Docomo Dake Boing

1012
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000

Mad World on the Wii, that game looks awesome

1015
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Gotta love a game with chainsaws

1016
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And yes, that's an awesome looking game on the Wii

1017
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000

00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yes, that's a game for people that don't speak English

1025
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And that's on the DS

1026
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
World in Conflict, the complete edition on PC coming out this week

1027
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And a few more things here, Vacation Sports on the Wii

1028
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Another party game collection

1029
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And finally Save the Best for Last, Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Xbox 360

1030
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And speaking of Xbox 360, you can get your limited edition

1031
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Red Xbox 360 Elite System

1032
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Some praise for Mad World in chat, Lazy Days, Mad World looks cool

1033
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Deep Man, can't wait for Mad World

1034
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It's nice to see a Wii game getting some fanboy lovin'

1035
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
There you go

1036
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's got John DiMaggio in it, I mean the voice of Bender

1037
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And Greg Proops from Whose Line doing sports commentary while you murder people with a chainsaw

1038
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
What more do you want?

1039
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That's pretty amazing

1040
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I randomly met Greg Proops like years ago

1041
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's nice to see that he still do it, because he had that game show

1042
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I met him right around the time he had that game show going on

1043
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And then that got cancelled, and then Whose Line wasn't on anymore

1044
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So I'm really glad to see he's around still

1045
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It's so awesome

1046
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Can't wait to play this game

1047
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You need to bring it over, I want to check it out

1048
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I don't know enough about this game, but you follow the chainsaw

1049
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's like the Running Man meets Sin City

1050
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
You follow those types of games better than I do, I will readily admit

1051
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Anyhow, let's move over to Japan and check out the Japanese release dates

1052
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm being distracted though with pictures

1053
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
The Dark Sakura is showing me of her old cosplay

1054
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I actually found a lot of old photos that I'm actually sorting through

1055
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And going to throw away the really bad ones

1056
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
But I just found my pictures that I took at a cemetery in Alabama

1057
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
There was one of you cosplaying as Emi though, I thought that one was really cute

1058
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
This particular photo that I will go and put on the camera in a second

1059
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Is from the Churchreach Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama

1060
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Of the only Revolutionary War veteran buried there

1061
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So that means that he had to have been listed when he was 15

1062
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Lots of love for Greg Proops in our chatroom apparently

1063
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
That's awesome!

1064
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
We should try to get him on the show or something

1065
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Nah, I don't know about that, that's like stretching the boundaries of you

1066
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Well, why not?

1067
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
He's a voice actor in a video game, maybe he wants to sell the game

1068
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
If the game does well, he'll want him back for a sequel

1069
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You never know

1070
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Alright, anyway, forget it

1071
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Let's move on to some Japanese release dates

1072
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Coming out in Japan, of course since we're getting it over here

1073
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
You know Japan's gonna be getting Resident Evil 5 over there

1074
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Actually, I think that just came out this last week

1075
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yeah, it came out last week

1076
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But, they are getting, I know this is new

1077
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
The Idolmaster Twins is new on the Xbox 360

1078
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Idolmaster is a pretty big franchise over there

1079
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And now it's got twins

1080
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So, on the Playstation 3, Army of Two gets a price reduction

1081
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
As it goes into EA's best hits collection as does Need for Speed Pro Street

1082
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
But if you want to get some new games in Japan, Resistance 2 is actually new for Japan

1083
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
In some DualShock packs

1084
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Musou Orochi Z is coming out from Koei this week as well

1085
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Over on the Playstation 3, and Skate also getting a price reduction

1086
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii

1087
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Phantom Brave Wii is coming out this week on March the 12th

1088
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
As is Sonic Tokunokishi comes out as well

1089
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm not sure what this, oh this is Sonic and the Black Knight

1090
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Over in Japan

1091
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Wii Cheer gets its release in Japan this week as well

1092
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Because I know you guys can't wait for a Wii Cheer over there

1093
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And Boku to Sim no Machi Party comes out as well from EA

1094
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
My Sims Party

1095
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Is this My Sims Party?

1096
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah

1097
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That is, that is

1098
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Also coming out on the Playstation 2, Galaxy Angel 2

1099
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Need for Speed Pro Street getting a reduction

1100
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And that's it for the Playstation 2 this week

1101
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Let's look at the handhelds real quick on the Nintendo DS

1102
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Tokumiki Memorial Girls' Side First Love Plus comes out from Konami this week

1103
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Also coming out from Konami, or I'm sorry, a price reduction for Survival Kids

1104
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Also coming out Konami Dual Spirits, the DS game

1105
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Actually that's another price reduction, I was going to say that game's been out a while

1106
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
The Sims Party game also coming out from EA on the DS this week

1107
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Retai Picross comes out from Nintendo this week

1108
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
First party game on the Nintendo DS

1109
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And quickly looking to see if the PSP is getting any love this week

1110
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well they are, you get Ever17, the Out of Infinity Premium Edition comes out from Cyberfront this week

1111
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
As well as Never7, the End of Infinity

1112
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Resistance Restribution also coming out on the PSP this week

1113
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And that looks to be about it, unless you're looking for a price reduction on Need for Speed Pro Street

1114
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So that's it for the Japanese release dates

1115
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Well how about some UK release dates, as soon as I set my photos down

1116
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Sure, let me read a quick chat comment while you're doing your photos

1117
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
AcidicVampire in chat says, when I play Wii Cheer, I actually attach streamers to my Wiimote to make them feel like real pom poms

1118
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You joke, you joke, but they sell those things for the Wiis

1119
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I was going to say, I'm surprised they don't sell those

1120
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
No, they do sell those, they sell Wii pom pom attachments for your damn remotes

1121
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yes, people are that retarded

1122
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I kind of want one for some reason, but I'm going to make mine

1123
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Well remember, you can use it for every game, so you know

1124
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Because I want to play MadWorld with my pom poms, yay, go cheer, cut you in half

1125
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
That's hilarious

1126
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I'll put this on the camera in a moment or if you want to do it for me

1127
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
This cat is 27 years old

1128
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Oh my heck, alright, get to the release dates

1129
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Okay, let me give you the photo, his name is Sean

1130
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's my cat from Alabama

1131
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Anyway, coming out on

1132
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I think he's a zombie

1133
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
That's the only way we can explain that he's lived that long

1134
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
He's alive by the power of evil

1135
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I've already said last week on the 8th and 9th that Flock was out

1136
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
The 10th, Tomb Raider, Underworld, Lara's Shadow on Xbox 360

1137
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Bleach Dark Souls, Codename Panzer's Cold War on PC, Persona 4

1138
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Oh, by the way, those last few were on the 13th

1139
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Resident Evil 5 on the 13th, Resistance Retribution

1140
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Ocom, Frontation, Sonic and the Black Knight, Tom Clancy's Hawks on PC

1141
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Cool

1142
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Tigerclaw just linked in chat

1143
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Sorry, I just saw a picture of those stupid attachments

1144
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Oh god, I almost want them just for the sheer gayness of it

1145
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I feel like I need to own it

1146
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I don't know what it is, but I'm just compelled to purchase it

1147
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Even though it only has a 1.5 star rating

1148
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Dude, $19.99 for two little pieces of plastic that you tape on to the ends of your Wiimotes

1149
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That's amazing

1150
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
We finally got a SKU for the Wii Music Instruments

1151
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
They have attachments for all those too

1152
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So you can look like a douchebag playing those

1153
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I want to point out, Amazon looks like they're having a sale

1154
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You can get that and a Wii Cheer and All Star Cheer Squad

1155
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Play together $84.97 for the Ultimate Cheerleader Pack

1156
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Oh god, alright

1157
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Waaaaaame

1158
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Anyways, there's going to be a new Pac-Man game on the way

1159
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
This is to celebrate the game's 30th anniversary

1160
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Good lord, you know, I remember just a few years ago when we were at E3

1161
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
when they were celebrating the 25th anniversary

1162
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Now, of course, the 30th anniversary will become 2010

1163
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So, not surprising there

1164
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And, no word on exactly what it is

1165
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I guess Namco Bandai, America's Makoto Iwai

1166
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
said, as a group, we feel that we should do something to make him come back

1167
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So there's one project that we've started working on

1168
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And I guess Yasu Hara is part of it

1169
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And says the new game design was sort of meeting his wish 100%

1170
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So, I have no idea what the hell that means, but it's going to be a Pac-Man game

1171
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So, set your expectations low

1172
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Well, I mean, the last Pac-Man game that came out was really awesome

1173
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Pac-Man Championship Edition is pretty great

1174
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Even Pac-Man Versus was pretty fun too

1175
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
But, yeah, I mean, not every Pac-Man game has been a winner

1176
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's Pac-Man, I mean, it's like

1177
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
If Pac-Man ran faster, we'd be having the same problem as Sonic

1178
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But, uh, I'm kind of curious to see how they're going to reinvent Pac-Man

1179
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
There are Pac-Pics, that seemed like a good idea

1180
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I love Pac-Pics

1181
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Until you played it, then you're like, wow, this sucks

1182
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah, Pac-Pics, it was one of those things that was neat in a small dose

1183
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Like, it was a great demo to show the DS off with

1184
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
But, as a game, eh, nah, didn't hold my attention

1185
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Pac could roll, that was kind of lame

1186
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You know what, Pac-Man, that Pac-Pics game

1187
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Like, you know how they're doing this DSI download service

1188
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Where games are only going to be a couple of bucks

1189
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
You know, their whole little digital distribution thing

1190
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Pac-Pics would have been a great candidate for, like, a little $5 game there

1191
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
That would have been, I think, where it would have been best served

1192
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But, obviously, they didn't have that at the time, so whatever

1193
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Um, anyhow

1194
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Just found a picture of Jason

1195
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
What? Our webmaster Jason?

1196
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
How old are these pictures? What are these all from?

1197
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
E3, O, almost

1198
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
O4, probably, right?

1199
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah, I found a really bad picture of us

1200
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Oh, boy

1201
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Oh, I remember that picture

1202
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
That's blurry

1203
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I look cute

1204
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Alright, hey, talking about pictures makes for great radio, doesn't it?

1205
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Hey, uh, Konami

1206
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You know our friends at Konami, they are turning 40 years old this week

1207
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
If you can believe it

1208
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You're over the hill!

1209
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Congratulations, Konami, you're old

1210
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
No, Konami has officially turned 40 this week

1211
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And, uh, quoting on the age of the company and how they did it

1212
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
The European president, Kuno Nio, says

1213
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Consistency plays a major part in everything Konami does

1214
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I don't know if that means, you know, rehashing their games over and over

1215
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
No, I'm kidding

1216
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Obviously, Konami's put out a lot of great games that we've loved very much over the years

1217
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So, there you have it

1218
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Konami also promises that there are a wealth of other new titles in development

1219
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
By the way, a game that I left out of my gaming week was the DDR on the iPhone

1220
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Was a game that I actually played this week, the brand new one

1221
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
They have DDR on iPhone now

1222
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Um, it's alright

1223
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You know, considering it's DDR on your iPhone

1224
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I mean, you don't actually dance

1225
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But, um, here's the thing

1226
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
There's this new mode they have called shake mode

1227
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Where you actually play DDR by tilting your iPhone to the left and to the right and up and back

1228
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You know, which is kind of stupid but cute

1229
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
But here's the weird thing

1230
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You only can play the tutorial song in shake mode

1231
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Like, is that a bug? Seriously?

1232
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Like, you were only meant to play the tutorial song and nothing else?

1233
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Like, did somebody forget to put that pointer in that says

1234
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Oh, after the tutorial, go back to the song select and not the main menu

1235
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So, I don't know

1236
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
A little strange

1237
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But, the game has a lot of songs, I guess

1238
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You know, it's got like 26 songs or something like that

1239
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But you only have like 9 to start

1240
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
You have to unlock them all slowly but surely

1241
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And I don't know, I hope there's an unlock code or something

1242
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Because I don't know if I can stand to just play these songs over and over again on the iPhone

1243
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But, you know, it is a lot of newer DDR songs

1244
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
There's some old ass stuff mixed in there

1245
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
But here's the thing that surprised me most

1246
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Did you know Brilliant To You now has a vocal version?

1247
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It's kind of scary

1248
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
That's all I have to say

1249
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Like, I've been out of the DDR loop for so long

1250
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I had no idea there was a Brilliant To You now with vocals

1251
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Is it voluntary singing?

1252
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
No, it's not voluntary, it's a dude

1253
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Or is it that really awful dude that like

1254
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
What was it, did that crappy rap that was in uh

1255
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It could very well be for all I know

1256
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
But, yeah, there's

1257
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You know, DDR music is interesting now

1258
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It's, you know, back in my day

1259
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It was a lot different

1260
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Getting these kids off your damn lawn?

1261
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Although, there was a Naoki and Smile DK song that was kind of cool

1262
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Because like, hey, Smile DK, you know

1263
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
They kind of weren't around in Bamani for a long, long time

1264
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Well, there is

1265
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
There is new DDR coming out

1266
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Like, later this month

1267
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Yeah, there's the, what, Hottest Party 2?

1268
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
No, it's Disney Grooves

1269
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That's right, the DDR Disney

1270
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I keep getting emails about another one too that's still in development

1271
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I thought it was another Hottest Party game

1272
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
No, well, I'm sure there will be another Hottest Party game of me

1273
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Because they keep putting that crap out

1274
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I don't know, it's just

1275
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Can't be excited about this stuff anymore

1276
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I will be more excited about DDR when there's something that's really reinvented it

1277
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
You know, I don't know, even just going to different versions of music

1278
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I have a way to do it, but no one wants to give me the money to do it

1279
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I know

1280
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Alright, let's move on, some more gaming news

1281
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Enough reminiscing about the past 40 years of Konami

1282
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
But, but, but, but, but we like the past

1283
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah, that's true, and I think back to the Konami of the 80s

1284
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
The old school Metal Gear game was amazing

1285
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
But anyway

1286
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Well, how about some different news

1287
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Ubisoft has actually pulled a game called I Am Alive

1288
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
That's being developed by Darkworks

1289
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
From their lineup

1290
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
They announced it at E3 that they wanted to release it

1291
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
This spring, but it's actually been delayed until March 2010

1292
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Because it's apparently such an ambitious title that they want to do it justice

1293
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So, let's hope so

1294
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
It was funny though, actually they announced it

1295
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Yeah, it's coming out in March

1296
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And they're like, uh, yeah, about that

1297
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It's actually financial year 2010

1298
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Oopsie

1299
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
We jumped the gun there

1300
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
So, sometime between now and March

1301
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Sweet

1302
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Anyways, there's something else that's kind of interesting

1303
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You remember we talked a little bit about it

1304
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
That Square Enix was starting to buy up some shares of Eidos

1305
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Well, Square Enix is hoping to finish buying the rest of Eidos by May

1306
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And they're actually expected to approve a deal with the Eidos shareholders

1307
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Later this month

1308
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And hopefully by May 6th

1309
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
There will be, I don't know

1310
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I guess they'll be under the ownership of Square Enix

1311
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
That's kind of interesting though

1312
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Because my thoughts are, why would you want Eidos?

1313
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I mean, really, it's Eidos

1314
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Well, they do own Tomb Raider rights

1315
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And there's a new Tomb Raider movie coming out

1316
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So maybe they're going to try and do a different type of Tomb Raider game for it

1317
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I don't know

1318
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Maybe try to reboot some of the franchises

1319
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Doesn't Eidos also have, uh, is it Hitman that they have?

1320
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Yeah

1321
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That was another big one they have

1322
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You know, that was a fairly successful number one movie

1323
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I suppose

1324
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
They have some big franchises that just need a swift kick in the butt

1325
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Well, maybe they can just pick up this company

1326
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So that they can just develop straight RPGs for, you know

1327
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
From Square Enix

1328
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And they all have to worry about branching out into other games

1329
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Because they can have Eidos do the other game genres

1330
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Now what are we going to call them?

1331
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Game Guru in our chat room suggests Squeenix Titos

1332
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
You know, here's funny though

1333
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
They actually had it on this article here

1334
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It's Square Idocs

1335
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Game Guru in chat says

1336
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Square Enix wants franchises that aren't JRPGs

1337
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And that could be, you know, there has been those stories

1338
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
About they want to get more into, you know, the more American style of the game development

1339
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So why not?

1340
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah, but I mean, this is about like half a step from, you know

1341
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Buying out Atari or something

1342
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I mean, no offense, it's just like

1343
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Eidos is not what they used to be

1344
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Tomb Raider is definitely not what it used to be

1345
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And, you know, there are other franchises, you know

1346
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
The ones that they still put out aren't what they used to be

1347
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And they haven't been really that great

1348
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Well, they obviously see something in it that maybe they can turn around

1349
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Maybe that's why they're able to buy them out

1350
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Because the shares are so low

1351
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I don't know, it's just

1352
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Whatever, I mean, if you're Square and you've got lots of money then

1353
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I guess it's fine to buy out Eidos

1354
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Well, hey, this game company seems to be doing something right

1355
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Because apparently, according to Nintendo Power's recent issue

1356
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
A boy and his blob is coming back on the Wii pretty soon

1357
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
That's kind of cool, this is coming from WayForward

1358
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Is the company that's making this game

1359
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Now, you might remember a little while ago

1360
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
They were kind of testing this on the DS

1361
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
There was a DS version of the game that was under development

1362
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But then it ended up getting cancelled

1363
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I remember playing this at E3 going like

1364
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Wow, it's a boy and his blob

1365
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
But now, apparently

1366
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
It's going to be reinvented on the Wii

1367
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And there's more information in this month's Nintendo Power magazine

1368
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
So that could be interesting

1369
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Remember a boy and his blob?

1370
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yes

1371
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It's kind of a neat game

1372
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
A little bit of a short game

1373
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
But, you know, back on the NES

1374
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It was kind of okay

1375
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Because it took a long time to figure out how to beat it

1376
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And get a cheat guide

1377
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
But this could be kind of cool

1378
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I don't think it's a remake of the first game though

1379
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I think it's probably a whole new thing

1380
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
But it definitely was an interesting concept

1381
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
If you don't remember what a boy and his blob was

1382
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Basically, it was kind of a puzzle game

1383
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
You had the blob and you were the boy

1384
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And you could walk around and the little blob would follow you

1385
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
And if you fed the blob different flavors of jelly beans

1386
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Then the blob would turn into different objects

1387
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Like the blob could turn into a ladder

1388
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
The blob could turn into a trampoline

1389
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Or a key

1390
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
You know, it would just basically shape shift all these different things

1391
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So you were kind of

1392
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It was a puzzle game basically

1393
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And you really had just enough jelly beans

1394
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
To figure out the answer to the puzzle

1395
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And get to the exit or whatever it was you were doing

1396
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So, it could be interesting to see how this plays out

1397
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
In, you know, many many years later

1398
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Or what, probably like 20 years since this game was first out

1399
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
It does look really cool that it's all hand drawn

1400
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Yeah, that could be very cool

1401
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
So

1402
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Hitstun in chat points out the way forward also made Contra 4

1403
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
So

1404
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Dark Tetsuya asks about the brick wall trick

1405
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
No, I don't remember that

1406
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I do seem to remember there was a really easy way you could cheat

1407
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
In Boy and His Blobs, that must be what he's talking about

1408
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So

1409
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Dan Shadow asks, is Jelly Belly paying for this?

1410
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't know, it could be a good sponsorship

1411
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I love Jelly Bellys

1412
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
No, they have Jelly Belly ballistic beans

1413
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Do they really have a game like that?

1414
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
They have a game that's coming out in April

1415
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
In April or May

1416
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
It's Jelly Belly ballistic beans

1417
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It's like, um

1418
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Bust a move

1419
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Um

1420
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
You know, the

1421
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Puzzle Bobble type of game

1422
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Um, you know Jelly Belly

1423
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Doesn't make the Harry Potter beans anymore

1424
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
They, uh, I guess lost the licensing agreement with that

1425
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
So now they have their own, like, sad flavor of Jelly Beans lined

1426
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Like, have you ever had those nasty Jelly Bellys?

1427
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Like in the, you know, vomit flavor and all that stuff?

1428
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Blah

1429
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I love Jelly Bellys

1430
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Anyway, alright

1431
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Sorry, I guess the Boy and His Blob story is making me hungry

1432
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Uh, we're almost to a little break here

1433
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
If you are craving food

1434
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
We just have a few more stories to get through

1435
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And then we're gonna be taking a break

1436
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And of course we also have the classic game of the week

1437
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Which we'll be getting to in just a little bit

1438
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
After a few more stories

1439
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Right, Dark Sakura?

1440
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Right, Rob!

1441
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Hey, hey

1442
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I actually just saw something that made me laugh

1443
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
That I'm gonna post in the chat room

1444
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And what is that, may I ask?

1445
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Here, look for yourself

1446
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Okay

1447
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Hold on, let's see

1448
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Someone did a parody of what the Watchmen ending was gonna be like

1449
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Oh, is this gonna spoil the actual movie?

1450
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Cause I haven't seen it yet

1451
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
No, Rob, it won't

1452
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Hahaha

1453
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Candy Mountain

1454
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Yeah

1455
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Nice

1456
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Okay

1457
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That's fantastic

1458
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Sorry, that's terrible radio

1459
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It's bas- nevermind

1460
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
At least our live listeners can look at that

1461
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Anyway, um

1462
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
How about some UK Virtual Console stuff?

1463
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
And this makes me happy

1464
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It's fun stuff

1465
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It's Clu Clu Land!

1466
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
We remember Clu Clu Land

1467
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I do, I remember playing it in Animal Crossing on the GameCube

1468
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Yep, and I played it on the Nintendo when it was new

1469
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Back in the day

1470
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Um, basically you just have to turn bubbles and make gems and stuff

1471
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And it's 500 Wii Points

1472
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And then Mega Drive title

1473
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Wonder Boy 3 Monster Lair

1474
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
So, um

1475
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Which I think as we got it was Wonder Boy Monster Land

1476
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I think we just got that on Virtual Console ourselves over here too

1477
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah

1478
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
That's 800 Wii Points

1479
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
So, go get em!

1480
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Go get em!

1481
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
280 games for the Virtual Console available now

1482
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah, then I'm not interested in any

1483
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Oh my god

1484
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Unfortunately

1485
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That's a lot

1486
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Still no Guardian Legend

1487
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
You wanna know what?

1488
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I probably have that many in the vault

1489
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I wish I was joking

1490
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
No, I wouldn't doubt it

1491
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It's just, you know, a lot of

1492
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I probably have that many ROMs, no I'm kidding

1493
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You know kinda why I wish I was joking?

1494
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Why?

1495
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Cause we're sorting them all

1496
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Fun

1497
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Lord

1498
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You need to get some big plastic bins

1499
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
We got em actually

1500
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Well, while I may not be interested in

1501
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The Virtual Console

1502
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I am interested in something else that's coming out on the Wii

1503
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
That would be Excitebots Trick Racing

1504
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And we actually got some details on it

1505
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Other than just a name now

1506
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
We have pictures of the box art that came out

1507
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Which looks interesting

1508
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Which was promptly stolen and put all around the rest of the internet

1509
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Yeah, because I don't give a shit

1510
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
So, whatever

1511
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
So anyways, yeah, box art

1512
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Which shows robotic animals

1513
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah, with wheels and stuff

1514
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That's kinda neat

1515
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Another interesting stuff

1516
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Before I was kinda worried

1517
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
The description made it sound like a party game and stuff

1518
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
It actually looks like Excite Truck

1519
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And it looks pretty sweet

1520
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Although there is weird stuff in there

1521
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Like there's a robotic turtle carrying a tambourine for some reason

1522
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And I'm not sure why

1523
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And then there's some other stuff that I saw with like

1524
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Throwing pies at clowns and stuff like that

1525
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So that's weird

1526
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
But it's still Excite Truck

1527
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Can I throw rocks at clowns?

1528
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
No, just pies

1529
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
But they're big pies

1530
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
But it's just

1531
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
They're rock pies?

1532
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
No, they're big pies

1533
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
But the game basically plays very similar to Excite Truck

1534
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It's based on a star system

1535
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Not necessarily

1536
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You can get in first place

1537
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Obviously helps you

1538
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But if you don't get in first place

1539
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
It doesn't really matter

1540
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Because it's all about who has the most star points

1541
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
At the end of the race

1542
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And you get points for doing different things like

1543
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Tree runs

1544
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Catching air, doing air tricks

1545
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Jumps, whatnot

1546
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So very similar to Excite Truck

1547
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
The controls are going to be exactly the same

1548
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
And they've added a few different things in there as well

1549
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Now they have these new energy poles

1550
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
That you can swing around

1551
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And gain a boost off of that

1552
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Lots of fun stuff

1553
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And then there's also some other game modes in there as well

1554
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Hopefully optional

1555
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
That you can play poker by

1556
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Driving through cards

1557
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Based on what you get

1558
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
You get points on the hands

1559
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And then also the clown thing

1560
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Which I don't know how that plays

1561
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
But you basically throw a pie at a clown

1562
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
As you're driving around

1563
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Nonetheless

1564
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
It looks interesting

1565
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
They've got vehicles flying through the air

1566
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And stuff like that

1567
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Plus you get a power up where your character

1568
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Is able to run with its legs and stuff

1569
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Any word about internet play like Mario Kart?

1570
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
There was no word on that

1571
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
But as I remember mentioning before

1572
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Two to six players online

1573
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Interesting

1574
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
And one to two players split screen

1575
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Local

1576
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Very very interested in checking this out

1577
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And the wife is extremely excited

1578
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It looks interesting

1579
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
But here's the thing about it

1580
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Didn't we hear that this developer

1581
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Was working on something that was so secret

1582
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
They had to have the secret screens and all this stuff

1583
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And I don't know if maybe somebody was just embellishing it or whatever

1584
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
But I'm really thinking in the back of my mind

1585
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Is this game really that big of a deal

1586
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
That they had to keep it super top secret?

1587
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It looks good

1588
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
It really does look good compared to Excite Truck

1589
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And actually the graphics are a lot better

1590
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I don't know, I'm very interested

1591
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
To check it out

1592
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
They could have a really good game on their hands

1593
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I think the robotic lizard

1594
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Frog thing is kind of cool

1595
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
They're going to have a mouse in there that they can play as

1596
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
A robotic mouse, but the turtle looks retarded

1597
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I'm sorry, he's got this retarded

1598
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Look on him

1599
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Like he's been touched in the head or something

1600
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I don't know, but

1601
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I don't have to play as a turtle

1602
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And there's also Ladybug that flies through the air

1603
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Alright, well some

1604
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
New details about another anticipated Wii game

1605
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Has hit the internet this week

1606
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It's about Punch-Out!

1607
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Punch-Out is coming out in May

1608
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But apparently some other new details have leaked out

1609
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
About the game, including the fact that some

1610
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Of the best of the original Punch-Out!

1611
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Cast will be returning

1612
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
King Hippo obviously was seen in some screenshots

1613
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Glass Joe is going to be in there

1614
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Von Kaiser apparently is going to be making a comeback

1615
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Not exactly one of the fighters

1616
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I would have thought would be the best of the original

1617
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Which started Make Me Fearful

1618
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Because I think somebody said on this show a couple weeks ago

1619
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Maybe this is just going to be a complete remake of the first game

1620
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
No, they're actually going to have new characters in there

1621
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's even says

1622
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
There's going to be some new characters in the game

1623
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Star Punches are coming back into the game

1624
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
No word on how you get them yet

1625
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
But that could be interesting

1626
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
By the way, Punch-Out! is also going to have two

1627
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Different control schemes

1628
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Of course there is the one

1629
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
That will be the whole, you know, waving your arms

1630
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Around in the air, but apparently

1631
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Also classic NES

1632
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Style controls

1633
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
If you flip your Wii remote on the side

1634
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And play the game, you can play the game that way

1635
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
So that's kind of cool

1636
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
For those of us that don't want to flail our arms around everywhere

1637
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
You can still have some fun with Punch-Out!

1638
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So there you go

1639
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Well, obviously Punch-Out!

1640
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Is a very classic video game

1641
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
But we like to put the spotlight on the classic game

1642
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Every week here on Orange Laundrio

1643
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And I can tell you this week it's not Punch-Out!

1644
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
But it is some game that you should definitely be checking out

1645
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And it's Dark Sakura's classic game of the week

1646
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
She's going to dig through her archives

1647
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And pull out a game

1648
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That she wants to share with all of you

1649
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic video game

1650
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Of the week this week?

1651
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
The classic game is Plio Plio

1652
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
It is a puzzle game

1653
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
That was created

1654
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
By Compile for the MSX2

1655
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And

1656
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It actually uses

1657
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Characters from

1658
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Mado Monogatari

1659
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
So it's just a fun little game

1660
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
That's where you drop

1661
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
These bean shaped thingies

1662
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And have to match them up

1663
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
But you can do drops

1664
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And make chain combos

1665
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And I think it's been

1666
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
One of the

1667
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I'd say

1668
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Blueprints for many other

1669
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Puzzle games to come out since

1670
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Sort of like Puzzle Fighter, remember?

1671
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Where you had your chains and everything

1672
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Basically

1673
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It's

1674
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
We got it in the US as Puyo Pop

1675
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And we first

1676
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Saw it though as Dr. Robotnik's

1677
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Mean Bean Machine

1678
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Genesis and Good Drive

1679
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Came out of Game Gear and Master System

1680
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Which that version actually came out in Europe

1681
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
And Brazil

1682
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And then we got it as

1683
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Kirby's Ghost Trap

1684
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Which was the

1685
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
European SNES version

1686
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And Kirby's Avalanche

1687
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Which was our version of it

1688
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
So

1689
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Basically

1690
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
The whole point of it

1691
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Is that you have to stack up

1692
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
The Puyo

1693
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And you have to

1694
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Match them up and

1695
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Get them in certain combos so that

1696
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You can throw that many

1697
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Number of lines

1698
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Over on your enemy

1699
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Who is also playing simultaneous

1700
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Either the enemy or the computer

1701
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And they can block your moves by getting

1702
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Combos of their own, but basically

1703
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Whoever has a higher combo

1704
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Then they get to

1705
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Sit over there, it's actually called

1706
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Rensa

1707
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
The chain

1708
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Of how they pop and fall

1709
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Is called Rensa

1710
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
So you can have any different kind of

1711
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Variety of it for how they fall

1712
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
And the blocks that fall on the other side

1713
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Are called

1714
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Ojama

1715
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Which are garbage blocks

1716
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Or as we get them

1717
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
They're new sets of Puyo

1718
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
So

1719
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Basically, like I said, the higher that you get

1720
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
The more that you drop on your opponent

1721
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
That they do not block

1722
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I'm sorry, this battle I'm watching on YouTube

1723
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Is quite epic

1724
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
My god, these players are amazing

1725
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
They're setting up chains left and right

1726
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I have seen the 19

1727
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Chain

1728
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Rob that someone managed to get

1729
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
That's pretty freaking epic

1730
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And actually this version of the music is from Puyo Puyo 2

1731
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
That I thought was cool

1732
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But basically

1733
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
You've got single Puyo

1734
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Where basically you just fight the computer

1735
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And then you have the versus mode

1736
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Which is double Puyo Puyo

1737
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
You've got characters in the game

1738
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Which we've seen a few of them in other games

1739
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Because actually, Carp Uncle made his way

1740
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Made a brief appearance in Dr. Robotnik's

1741
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
B&B machine

1742
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And it was called Has-Been

1743
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
In that game

1744
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
But you have

1745
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Maja who is the main character

1746
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Blue girl with brown hair wearing a blue dress

1747
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And um

1748
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
You also

1749
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
You know, also some of her chains

1750
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
She calls out different spells

1751
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Because her character is apparently a sorceress

1752
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And then you've got Carp Uncle

1753
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Carp Uncle is cute

1754
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And then

1755
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
For the first Puyo Puyo

1756
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You get Skeleton Tea, Nasu Grave, Mummy

1757
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Drako Centauros

1758
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Sukeidodora

1759
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Um

1760
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Skia Podes

1761
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Harpy

1762
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
You actually have Zombie too

1763
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Which I think is cool

1764
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And my favorite name here is Zodamaio

1765
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
And your boss is Satan

1766
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And you have to fight him

1767
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Because he likes Arl

1768
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
But he really likes Carp Uncle

1769
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
As far as other versions

1770
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
That have come out

1771
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Like I said, we've had the US ones

1772
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
That was Dr. Robotnik's

1773
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
BB Machine, Koopa's Avalanche

1774
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Um

1775
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
They're uh

1776
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
They actually say that the

1777
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Puyo were

1778
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Supposed to be like how the

1779
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Slimes were in Dragon Quest

1780
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
They're actually from that

1781
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
RPG game Madou Monogatari

1782
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Which if anyone's played it, I'd love to know

1783
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Um, I haven't

1784
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
But anyway, as other games came out

1785
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
There was the

1786
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Puyo Puyo Pocket

1787
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And you had your Pocket Color one

1788
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
So we've had Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2

1789
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
We've had Puyo Pop over here

1790
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
In Japan it was Vina De Puyo Puyo

1791
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Which means Everybody Puyo Puyo

1792
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Um

1793
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
We've had Puyo Puyo Sun

1794
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Which there was actually a Nintendo 64 version

1795
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Puyo Puyo Sun 64

1796
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And a Saturn version

1797
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And Puyo Piyon

1798
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Which was um, pretty much the second one

1799
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
We also had Puyo Puyo Fever

1800
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Which we got as Puyo Puyo Pop Fever

1801
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Um, that was on

1802
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Uh, actually that was

1803
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
The last game that was released for the Dreamcast

1804
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
So we've had

1805
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Versions on Xbox, Playstation 2

1806
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
GBA, GameCube

1807
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
DS, PSP

1808
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Even Mac versions, Widow versions

1809
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Pocket PC, Palm versions

1810
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
DS, you know, all other

1811
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Kinds of versions, so

1812
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
It's been pretty cool

1813
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I actually have the TurboGrafx version

1814
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
At home

1815
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Which my friend gave me

1816
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
They made this game on every damn system basically

1817
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Yeah, and you know there was actually

1818
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
A music game sequel

1819
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Yeah, I remember, I think you showed it to me once

1820
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah, you showed it to me once

1821
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Puyo Da

1822
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I thought it was just you

1823
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It's a fun little game

1824
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
With Puyo Da, it's like

1825
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
You have to hit the buttons at the right time

1826
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Sort of like, you know, Parappa-ish thing

1827
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
But depending on how many you get right

1828
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
You know, you get more points

1829
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And they get bombed

1830
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So it's an interesting little spinoff

1831
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Alright

1832
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Well that's going to do it, is that it?

1833
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I just had the line in there though

1834
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
That I know that

1835
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
It's not what she's saying

1836
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
It's like the game psychic storm

1837
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And you translate the line the same way as I get pissed off

1838
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
My husband's crazy

1839
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So it's the same

1840
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Alright

1841
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I believe that is going to do it

1842
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I hope he's listening because I picked this for him

1843
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Puyo Puyo

1844
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And apart from me because I love Puyo Puyo

1845
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Puyo Puyo is like my favorite puzzle game ever

1846
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
You do bring it up on the show quite often

1847
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So I'm glad it's finally had a chance to be the game of the week

1848
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I'll link this other one

1849
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Because there's actually a Puyo Puyo anime

1850
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
That was supposed to have been out too

1851
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
And a lot of people do

1852
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Really freaky cosplay from it

1853
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And also I would say

1854
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
If you want to get a recent version

1855
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Of Puyo Puyo

1856
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I got the Sonic Genesis collection

1857
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Because it has Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine

1858
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Which granted isn't a pure

1859
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Quote unquote version of Puyo Puyo

1860
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
But you get at least the gist of the game itself

1861
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And you know it's part of that big collection

1862
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So there you go

1863
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
There it is your classic game of the week Puyo Puyo

1864
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
We're going to take a quick break here on Orange Launch Radio

1865
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
But we will be back with plenty more in part B

1866
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
We're going to talk about other companies getting into used game businesses

1867
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
That should be interesting

1868
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Another game rental methods

1869
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And some classic fighting games

1870
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
For fighters in the wake of Street Fighter IV

1871
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
We're going to be talking about some of that

1872
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Coming up next here on Orange Launch Radio

1873
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Stay tuned

1874
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio

1875
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
On this Sunday evening

1876
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
March the 8th of 2009

1877
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Where we are taping live on AllGames.com

1878
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
www.AllGames.com is the radio network that we are a part of

1879
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Or if you want to check out our show specifically

1880
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
You can check out www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

1881
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
You really should though check out both

1882
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
You know you get a lot of time to surf the internet

1883
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I'm sure so you should check both sites out

1884
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Because they're both great

1885
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Alright we've been talking a lot about the latest and greatest in gaming

1886
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
We're not done yet we've got plenty more

1887
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Let's talk a little more business now Loki

1888
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yes let's talk business

1889
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Toys R Us is actually going to try to get into the used game business

1890
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
They're going to start doing trade-ins I guess

1891
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Apparently an in-store advertisement

1892
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Which was snapped by one of the cheap ass gamer forum members

1893
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Actually showed that they're starting to do used game sales

1894
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
In some select stores I guess like a trial period

1895
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Apparently you'll be able to return your games for I guess Jeffrey bucks

1896
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I'm sure it will be kind of similar to the gift certificate right?

1897
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Yes Jeffrey the giraffe dollars

1898
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Which have no currency whatsoever in the real world

1899
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
But yes you will be able to sell your used games back

1900
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And receive store credit and no word on any pricing tiers

1901
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Or whether they're going to be competitive or not

1902
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
But hey you know another option for trading in your used games is always welcome

1903
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Although to be honest man the last time I went into the Toys R Us it was sad

1904
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Like half the store was converted into a baby's R Us and that was really sad

1905
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Well I don't know if that's what sells you know

1906
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I remember those Toys R Us was the shit when I was a kid

1907
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It was amazing

1908
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
It was so amazing

1909
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
But you know now they have baby's R Us in there

1910
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Well you know if it sells it sells right?

1911
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I just remember back in the day they used to have like the Atari 2600 thing set up

1912
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
You could play the old school games on there

1913
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
But it's cutting into my Lego aisle you know

1914
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Well maybe that's because they have a Lego store at the mall you know

1915
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Well fuck the- wait what mall?

1916
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Arden mall they have like a full Lego store now

1917
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Are you shitting me?

1918
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I am not shitting you

1919
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
That's so awesome

1920
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
It's apparently like a chain of stores now

1921
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Good! We need a Lego store

1922
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
They can get rid of the Apple store anytime though

1923
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
But Lego store is awesome

1924
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I did not know you had such a fan boner for Legos

1925
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I have 10 gallons of Legos

1926
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I measure my Legos in volume now

1927
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Oh my god

1928
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Between her video game vault and your Legos like I feel like I need something

1929
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
You know what I do have? I have a full dresser drawer

1930
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Full dresser drawer full of PEZ dispensers

1931
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I do have that

1932
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I guess that's my thing I don't know

1933
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
One of these days I'll take them all out and put them on display again

1934
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
But it was getting to be a hassle

1935
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
They'd always fall over

1936
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
People would come over and knock them over to be funny

1937
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Or they'd get punched over when somebody was drunk

1938
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
That's messed up

1939
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Do you have one of those PEZ dispensers that dispenses like the whole like rolls of PEZ?

1940
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
No I've seen those for sale though

1941
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I kind of quit PEZ collecting for a little while

1942
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Something I did like in high school and for a little while after that

1943
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
But you know what the nice thing is since I stopped for so long

1944
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Now I have a lot of old PEZ dispensers that have just been sitting in a desk drawer

1945
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Not getting any sunlight or anything

1946
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
They're in good condition I'm sure

1947
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
But it's not that I'm in the buying and selling business of PEZ dispensers

1948
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:39,000
You don't want to be one of those dudes on the food network during unwrapped or something

1949
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Like I watched one last night and they were talking about some guy that collected Mr. Peanut stuff

1950
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And he doesn't even like peanuts

1951
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,000
He's just a douchebag that collects Mr. Peanut crap

1952
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
It's like really? Okay

1953
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Of course some might argue that I collect Hello Kitty stuff

1954
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Because even like I'm making coffee right now

1955
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Like for those listening live that heard me during the break in the middle there

1956
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I'm brewing some coffee right now on my Hello Kitty coffee maker

1957
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
With your Hello Kitty toaster that makes the Hello Kitty

1958
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Hey it works, don't hate

1959
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
It brews a damn fine cup of coffee

1960
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
And it was cheap, 20 bucks

1961
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So, whatever

1962
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Anyway, I don't know how we got from video games to Hello Kitty

1963
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
But we can go back to talking about used games a little bit

1964
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
You know what's interesting is that Toys R Us is kind of in cahoots with Amazon

1965
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
So to kind of hear this

1966
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
You know, because if you go to Amazon.com

1967
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Their toy section is all Toys R Us

1968
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Well Amazon.com is also running a trade-in program

1969
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Which would make sense if Toys R Us is doing this

1970
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Because they kind of have a little working agreement or whatever's going on

1971
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
What you do, you can actually trade in games

1972
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
You select games on their website apparently

1973
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
They have to be in good condition

1974
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
You send in a shipment or whatever

1975
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
You print a shipping label on your computer

1976
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And you can actually send these games in

1977
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
And they will actually send you an Amazon.com gift card

1978
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
For however much the games were worth

1979
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Which is kind of interesting

1980
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Now this is something apparently I think is just being tested right now

1981
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I don't think it's actually starting just yet

1982
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
But, yeah

1983
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I don't know

1984
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
No, I guess it is up and live now

1985
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
There you go, you can actually check it out on Amazon.com

1986
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I'm looking at the link right now

1987
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And yeah, you can actually look up on their site

1988
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Things you want to trade in

1989
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And sell back to Amazon.com and you'll get a gift card

1990
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Which, you know, considering that Amazon.com is much more than video games

1991
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I think this is where it could prove to be an interesting competitor to GameStop

1992
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Granted, GameStop, you can get cash for your games

1993
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
You don't get a lot of cash

1994
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
You get more if you go for the gift card

1995
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
On Amazon.com, you can get

1996
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Books, DVDs

1997
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Heck, you can get appliances and stuff on the site

1998
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
You can get airsoft guns

1999
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
You can get a lot of stuff on Amazon.com

2000
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So it does open up this whole new door for that

2001
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You don't have to just trade in games for games

2002
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Oh yeah, and they also sell books

2003
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
AgDeftInChat, chat.orangelandraday.com says

2004
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Rob sounds excited

2005
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
I don't know, I don't ever sell games back

2006
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I probably should

2007
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I have a lot

2008
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I'm going to miss Drive Unlimited

2009
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I realize I had it sitting on my shelf collecting dust

2010
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I had no idea you even had it

2011
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Well, that's great, I'll plug that in and try it this week or something

2012
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
But yeah, I don't know

2013
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
DarkTotemic in chat says

2014
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Sky, really, the only thing GameStop has over these is

2015
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
When you trade in a game, you can get a new one right away

2016
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Amazon, you'll have to wait for shipping

2017
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And that is a good counterpoint

2018
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Because yeah, I don't like to wait for shipping and all this stuff

2019
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I don't even like Netflix, because it's too slow

2020
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
When I want to watch a movie, I want to watch it now

2021
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
That's why I like Netflix Instant Queues, but let's face it, not everything is available on the Instant Queue

2022
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So, I don't know

2023
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
DJ Rama S in chat says

2024
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Now at GameStop, you get the same amount if it's cash or credit

2025
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
That must be a new thing

2026
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I don't know about that

2027
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
It could be a promotion or something they're running right now

2028
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
But it didn't used to be that way

2029
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Yeah, it seems kind of fishy

2030
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Because I'd be getting cash every time

2031
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Why now, do you think that they're getting into this?

2032
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Do you think it's just the state of the economy?

2033
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
There's more of a demand for used games

2034
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Because $60 is a really high price point to get games

2035
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I don't know

2036
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Probably it's a big margin item

2037
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It's a business that has a good margin on it

2038
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Why not try to get into it?

2039
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Amazon is a powerful name

2040
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Online merchants

2041
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:13,000
If they can put together a really valuable system that people want to check out

2042
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Because I remember reading the trade-in values for some of these games

2043
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And they were a few bucks higher than GameStop

2044
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
But you've got to wait

2045
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
A little bit longer

2046
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
If you want to go that route

2047
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I guess you could

2048
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
If you're kind of patient

2049
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I may look up some of my games to see if they're worth anything

2050
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
If you're really patient

2051
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Just put them on eBay

2052
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Seriously

2053
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Did you know Beautiful Katamari is a rare game now?

2054
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
On Xbox 360

2055
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I guess they don't print it anymore

2056
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
When you find it online

2057
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
It's actually kind of pricey

2058
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Kind of interesting

2059
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Damn

2060
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
That's what I heard earlier today

2061
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
DarkSoccer, I would ask for your opinion on this whole thing

2062
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
But then I kind of realized you have a museum in your house

2063
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
You probably never sell back video games

2064
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Do you?

2065
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Sometimes we do, but we just sell back the newer crap

2066
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Like sports games and shit

2067
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I see

2068
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Is this something that interests you at all?

2069
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Let's assume, hypothetically, your husband didn't manage

2070
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Direct competition of this whole thing

2071
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Do you think this Amazon.com thing is something that would be interesting?

2072
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I don't think so

2073
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
We don't trade books at a video game store

2074
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
We just take them back to his store

2075
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And trade them in for games at his store

2076
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Right, but let's say hypothetically

2077
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
He didn't have that

2078
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Because not everybody has a husband that does that

2079
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I just thought I'd ask

2080
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Any more you want to add to this DarkSagra?

2081
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Good idea in theory

2082
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I think Chegg.com started the trend actually

2083
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
For doing it online

2084
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
For having schoolbooks that you could rent

2085
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And then trade in your old schoolbooks online

2086
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
To them and then get credit

2087
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
For stuff for your next

2088
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Semester schoolbooks

2089
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
It is interesting how the internet will do this sometimes

2090
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Is that, you know, they might take an idea

2091
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Like, for instance, Gamefly was essentially

2092
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Kind of a rip-off of Netflix in a way

2093
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
But it was, you know, for video games

2094
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
So it's kind of interesting how you might take an idea

2095
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
For one industry and kind of make it your own industry

2096
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And then, you know

2097
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
That's your new business

2098
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
But I don't know, anyway

2099
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Let's go on to the next story

2100
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Well, in other news

2101
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Speaking of GameStop

2102
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
They've actually dropped

2103
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
13%

2104
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
In their stock value

2105
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Ever since Amazon announced

2106
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Their little trade-in deal

2107
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
They actually

2108
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Ended

2109
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
The day

2110
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
On Thursday trading in at $3.54

2111
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Lower than it had before

2112
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
So it looks like

2113
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
That their investors are actually

2114
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Getting kind of worried about

2115
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Amazon's little plan

2116
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Even though GameStop themselves aren't

2117
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And looking at this

2118
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
It's a fairly significant

2119
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Drop from what it was

2120
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Interesting

2121
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Another company

2122
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Is actually trying something a little bit different

2123
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
As far as games go

2124
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Is actually Gamefly

2125
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Now Gamefly is testing out this brand new kiosk

2126
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Called the GBox

2127
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
It's a game rental kiosk

2128
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
It's gonna be

2129
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
It's been spotted at Texas Tech University

2130
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
They're probably gonna be launching

2131
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
This

2132
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Probably on a limited basis right now

2133
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
To check it out

2134
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
It will allow you to rent

2135
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Games

2136
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
For $2.49 a day

2137
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
For, you know, Xbox 360

2138
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
And PS3

2139
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
And $1.99 a day for Wii

2140
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
And it's gonna have new titles

2141
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
And they're gonna carry them for, I guess, a short period of time

2142
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And apparently

2143
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Now no word yet

2144
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
If this is gonna tie into

2145
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Your Gamefly subscription

2146
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Because that would be pretty cool

2147
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
If you could actually have your

2148
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Gamefly subscription

2149
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
And be able to say

2150
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Take these back to a kiosk

2151
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Instead of mailing them back in

2152
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
That might be pretty cool

2153
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
But I know definitely kiosk rentals

2154
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And stuff like that are pretty popular

2155
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
They've, you know, hell with Redbox

2156
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
And stuff and almost all the McDonalds

2157
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And all the grocery stores out there

2158
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
It's not surprising that they're

2159
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Gonna do something like this

2160
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And actually I'm kind of interested in that

2161
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Hopefully they do put that out

2162
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Because $2.49 a night is not too bad actually

2163
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
But if you compare it to

2164
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Say $8 for 5 days

2165
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I guess

2166
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
It could become expensive

2167
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
But if you just want a taste of a game

2168
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
For like a day or something

2169
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Might not be a bad idea

2170
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I'm kind of dumb, the ones I see at Walmart

2171
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And stuff with the, you know, DVDs

2172
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
But I have Netflix, I have Instant Netflix

2173
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
You know, I have other ways to access movies

2174
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
But then I think about this whole concept for games

2175
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And I'm kind of like, well, you know, if

2176
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Walmart right by my house had a box like this

2177
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I might be tempted to rent games

2178
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Rather than just

2179
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
You know, purchasing them

2180
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
For like $60

2181
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
But you can kind of already do that at Blockbuster

2182
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And stuff, so I wonder what it is about these kiosks

2183
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
That makes it so appealing

2184
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I don't know why I rent a new movie from a kiosk

2185
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Because you can get it at the same thing at Blockbuster

2186
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
For the same price

2187
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Or, you know, for a longer period of time

2188
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Obviously, but you know, if you want to do it by night

2189
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
It's all about convenience

2190
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Because once, you know, if something like this takes off

2191
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Then you're going to see a lot more of these people

2192
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Doing it, and I bet you anything

2193
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
If Gamefly has good success with this

2194
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
You'll probably see Redbox doing it

2195
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
They'll probably just have some sort of hybrid kiosk

2196
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Where you can rent games and movies

2197
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And trust me, companies like that

2198
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Have thought about doing it

2199
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And they've tested it in some markets

2200
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
But the problem is, though, is

2201
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
They're retarded, and they think that they can

2202
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Make their money back on a game

2203
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Charging 99 cents a night

2204
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Well, that ain't the case, because games cost $60

2205
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Where movies cost $20

2206
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
So it's obviously not going to make sense for them

2207
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You try to tell to them, they don't understand

2208
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Some comments from Chatroom, AcidicVampire

2209
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Kind of said the same thing you did

2210
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Redbox, the video game edition

2211
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So, perhaps just a matter of time

2212
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Blockbuster is still around, LOL

2213
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
That's true, you know, these big box stores

2214
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Are having a hard time kind of staying in business

2215
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Because of just the competition they're getting from Netflix

2216
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And so on and so on

2217
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
You know, I don't know, I think Blockbuster has a really interesting

2218
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Setup with the fact that they have

2219
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Their Netflix slash, what do they call it?

2220
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Blockbuster Total Access or something

2221
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It's like basically Netflix, okay

2222
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
But it's Blockbuster stuff

2223
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
And you can trade in the store

2224
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So that way they get around the whole shipping thing

2225
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
If you don't want to wait for shipping, you can trade in the store

2226
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
It's cool, but the thing that Netflix has on them

2227
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Is that Netflix has the streaming

2228
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And Blockbuster doesn't

2229
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Like if Blockbuster teamed up with PS3 or something

2230
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I would leave Netflix

2231
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And go to Blockbuster

2232
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
You know, that was one of the rumors floating around

2233
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
My own

2234
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
That would be pretty big

2235
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
You know, Blockbusters and stuff like that

2236
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
The kiosks are good if you know what you're looking for

2237
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
But a lot of the times

2238
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
If you don't know what you're looking for

2239
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
The kiosks are not really good

2240
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Because then you can't just browse stuff

2241
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I mean, they do have stuff

2242
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
You can look at

2243
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
But there's going to be a lot of people

2244
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Waiting for the stupid kiosk

2245
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
And you kind of feel pressured

2246
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Let me ask a question to chat and everybody here

2247
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Kind of a little bit of a deeper question about this

2248
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
And everybody in the studio and those in chat too

2249
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Is this type of announcement

2250
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Really a good thing for the gaming industry

2251
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Because if we're sitting here

2252
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Loki and I talking about

2253
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Maybe we'll stop making these $60 impulse buys

2254
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
If we could just rent the game for $2.50

2255
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Out of one of these kiosks

2256
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
In the long run, is this going to be a good thing

2257
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
For the gaming industry

2258
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Or is this setting up the gaming industry to get shot in the foot

2259
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
No, I think it is a good thing

2260
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And the reason why is because if this kiosk

2261
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Is going to be set up similar to say

2262
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
A red box kiosk

2263
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Not only can you rent stuff from them

2264
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
You can buy stuff from them

2265
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
And so, just because they put stuff in there

2266
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
People might like it

2267
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And they can purchase it from the kiosk

2268
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
However though

2269
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
On kind of the DVD movie side

2270
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Not everyone is on board with the whole kiosk things

2271
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
In fact, there's a deal going on right now

2272
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
With Universal

2273
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Where all their product is basically banned

2274
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
From red box kiosks

2275
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
They will not sell to red box

2276
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And they will find anybody that sells to them

2277
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
And basically ruin any sort of deals

2278
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
That have gone on

2279
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
So, red box

2280
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
The people that run those

2281
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Have to go out and actually purchase movies

2282
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
From say a big box retailer

2283
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
And then put them in their kiosk

2284
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
But they can't purchase them directly

2285
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
So they think that it's affecting their

2286
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Sell through business

2287
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
By having these red box kiosks

2288
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Really when you look at the facts

2289
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
That's not really the case

2290
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
It's not really having a large impact on it

2291
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
But that's the fear

2292
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
But the thing is

2293
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
With $60 games nowadays

2294
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I think a lot more people are renting things

2295
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
But there's still those other rental avenues

2296
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
You know, you don't necessarily

2297
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Need to use this kiosk

2298
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And right now this kiosk thing is very limited

2299
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Question from Robert M. in Chat

2300
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And I don't know if you know this because it involves Apple

2301
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
But didn't Universal pull their videos from iTunes at one point?

2302
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I think they did because I soon remember like Heroes

2303
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And the NBC shows

2304
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
But I think that was more of an NBC thing

2305
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And NBC and Universal are in cahoots

2306
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
So I think, I don't know if it's necessarily related to the red box thing

2307
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I think it was always a money thing

2308
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Right?

2309
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Other great comments from chat, thank you chatters

2310
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Breslull, no

2311
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
This was the same thing as Blockbuster renting games

2312
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
And Nintendo got all pissy back in the late 80s, early 90s

2313
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Acidic Vampire

2314
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
It's a great thing because people will still buy the game

2315
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
If they like it, especially gamers

2316
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
DJ Rama S

2317
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
This could force the gaming industry to lower the price of the PlayStation 3

2318
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
360 games

2319
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
ActDeft, sounds interesting but I really don't know if it'll work or not

2320
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
XLink

2321
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
It can be a pro because you can try to see if you want to buy the game

2322
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Yeah, I mean I get that

2323
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I see the pro for us

2324
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I don't know if I see the pro for the developers

2325
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
You know what I'm surprised hasn't happened yet

2326
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
GameStop doing rentals

2327
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet

2328
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Who knows

2329
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Son of Dad

2330
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
It might bring down game prices for retail as a whole

2331
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I would buy a used game from a red box for 25 bucks

2332
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
If it was available

2333
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Superdude in chat says

2334
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Wouldn't it be great if you could just stream new releases games

2335
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Like you do with Netflix on Xbox Live

2336
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I bet you something like that is coming

2337
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
There's those rumors going around that the PSP 2

2338
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Or whatever they're going to call it

2339
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
New PSP is going to not have a UMD slot

2340
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I think we had a story on that a couple weeks ago

2341
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Imagine if you could only download games

2342
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I don't use my UMD slot

2343
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Well

2344
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
It's a little different for you

2345
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
But you know what I'm saying

2346
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
You kind of are seeing this shift towards digital distribution

2347
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I think there was a lot of

2348
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I seem to remember

2349
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
We've been doing this show long enough now

2350
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I seem to remember in the last generation

2351
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
When it was new and all this stuff was new

2352
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
When we first started our show

2353
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
There was talk that this round of systems

2354
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
We're in now

2355
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Was going to be all digital distribution

2356
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And certainly with things like Xbox Live Arcade

2357
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
PlayStation Network

2358
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
There's a gigantic foot in the door

2359
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
But we haven't seen a complete shift to that yet

2360
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
But the games on Xbox Live are getting bigger and bigger

2361
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
You know they got rid of those limits on Xbox Live

2362
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
That Watchmen game is what

2363
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Like a gig or something

2364
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I mean that's the size of a DVD

2365
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I don't know

2366
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
You know

2367
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I would think maybe something like that is coming

2368
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Where you could stream games like that

2369
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
But I don't think it's going to be

2370
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
The retail games

2371
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
It's going to be a long time before you see the retail games

2372
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Buy into that

2373
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
But certainly

2374
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Digital distribution has games all its own

2375
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Sony's on board with it

2376
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
They're doing their first party games

2377
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Available for PSP as digital downloads

2378
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
At the same time as release

2379
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
And they've kind of

2380
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Tested the waters a little bit with Gran Turismo 5

2381
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Prologue, Warhawk

2382
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
You know, Burnout Paradise

2383
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
So

2384
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
If they can find a way that

2385
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
People would be interested

2386
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
In purchasing these games

2387
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Heck a lot of Xbox Live Arcade games

2388
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I could see that you know

2389
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
They could have released them as a disc version

2390
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
But they decided not to

2391
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
And they just released it as an Xbox Live Arcade title

2392
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
And it's still done very well

2393
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I'm not surprised

2394
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Alright, we're going to move on to another story

2395
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
But if you want to give your comments on this

2396
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Mailbag at orangelauncherator.com

2397
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Send us an email especially

2398
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I really want to hear from

2399
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
And I know we have a few that listen to this show

2400
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I want to hear from the people that work for the developers and publishers

2401
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
What do you think about these boxes?

2402
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
What do you see as the impact to your business?

2403
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I want to kind of hear from those guys

2404
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
If you need to stay anonymous for whatever reason

2405
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Then put it in your email

2406
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
We'll be happy to stay anonymous

2407
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I want to hear from that side of things

2408
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Because I don't think we have anybody

2409
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
In the chat tonight

2410
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about

2411
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Maybe games that you might rant through these kiosks someday

2412
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Arc System Works

2413
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
They are the folks that put together Guilty Gear

2414
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
They are doing a new high def 2D fighter

2415
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
The game is called Blaze Blue

2416
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I don't know how exactly you pronounce that

2417
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
It's Blaze Blue I would imagine

2418
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's coming out on the Xbox 360

2419
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
And the Playstation 3

2420
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Right now the game is out in Japanese arcades

2421
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
It's coming out to home consoles over in Japan

2422
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
And it's going to be coming out on the Xbox 360

2423
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
And PS3 as well

2424
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Apparently over the Japanese arcade release

2425
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
In the console versions there will now be a story mode

2426
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Some individual stories for each character

2427
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
And so on

2428
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
30 hours of gameplay according to the director Toshimichi Mori

2429
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Also there's going to be

2430
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Of course online support

2431
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Which you can expect in this current generation of games

2432
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
And download content as well

2433
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Although they haven't said is that just going to be outfits

2434
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
New characters, moves, backgrounds

2435
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Whatever

2436
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Kind of interesting especially if you're into

2437
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Those Japanese fighting games

2438
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I know there's a few sprinkled throughout the country

2439
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Those Japanese style arcades where you can go play those machines

2440
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I'm sure for fighting games

2441
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Fans there's a few of this

2442
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
But it's interesting now that you're starting to hear

2443
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
A little bit about a resurgence of 2D fighters

2444
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I wonder if Street Fighter 4 is to thank for any of that

2445
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Although I imagine something like this

2446
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Had to be in development

2447
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
For a long long time

2448
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Shadow Charlie in chat says

2449
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Yeah I played Blaze Blue in Chinatown

2450
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
What'd you think? I'm curious

2451
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I had not heard of this game before tonight

2452
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Seeing that news bit

2453
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
They showed it off a while ago

2454
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
It looks pretty sweet

2455
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
It's all hand drawn

2456
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
100,000 animations per character

2457
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Nice

2458
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Dan Shadow I agree with his comment in chat

2459
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
When are we going to have a new Marvel vs Capcom

2460
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
That's the one I'd like to see

2461
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Or Capcom vs SNK

2462
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Would be the one I'd really like to see

2463
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
A few weeks ago on the show about how Street Fighter 4

2464
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Feels a little bit like there's a slight SNK influence

2465
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Like Crimson Viper

2466
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Totally feels like she's lifted out of an SNK

2467
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
But anyhow

2468
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Go listen to a previous show

2469
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
If you want to listen to that

2470
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Other 2D fighter news Dark Sakura

2471
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Well we have

2472
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Actually it's funny you mentioned SNK

2473
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
We actually have news

2474
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
On King of Fighters 12

2475
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
How long has it been out?

2476
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
12 years maybe

2477
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Lucky guess

2478
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Well it's actually the

2479
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
First HD version

2480
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
That's going to be on

2481
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
From SNK Playmore

2482
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
It's supposed to be on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3

2483
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
It has 20 playable characters

2484
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
And they're all

2485
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Freshly redrawn

2486
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
And the backgrounds are all new and pretty

2487
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And

2488
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Supposed to really kick a bunch of ass

2489
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
There's supposed to be preview footage

2490
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And images

2491
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Included with the PS2 release of

2492
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match

2493
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Let us know if you see them

2494
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
My's in it right?

2495
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
That's all I want to know

2496
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Well of course we already heard boobs

2497
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Alright me bouncy

2498
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
That's all I need

2499
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Anyways

2500
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
So

2501
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Interesting

2502
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Of course there's a lot of

2503
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Piracy and flashcard developers

2504
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
On

2505
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
The DS and one of those would be

2506
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
The Cyclo DS or

2507
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
The CycloWiz which is the flash

2508
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Not flashcard but the modchip I have on my Wii actually

2509
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
They have developed

2510
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
A new

2511
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Program or update to their

2512
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Program that bypasses

2513
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
The anti-piracy

2514
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Features in a lot of these games

2515
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
And apparently now works on all the current games

2516
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
That feature some sort of anti-piracy

2517
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Lockout

2518
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Yeah

2519
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
There's no way to spin that

2520
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
That's only for piracy

2521
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
So I guess

2522
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
If you're interested in pirating games

2523
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
The Cyclo DS is the way to go

2524
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
For now

2525
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
But interesting though

2526
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Is this something we should really be encouraging?

2527
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
No

2528
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
But it's one of those things that you know

2529
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
One reason I like to report on this on the show

2530
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Is I know we all do is

2531
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
It's out there

2532
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So you can't deny its existence

2533
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
So it's kind of interesting to see what

2534
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
That scene does to always compensate for what

2535
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
The developers of the systems do and back and forth

2536
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Yeah

2537
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Alright

2538
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Talking a little bit

2539
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
About Metal Gear Online

2540
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Kind of moving over a little bit

2541
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
It's a new expansion coming out on St.

2542
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Patrick's Day March 17th

2543
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
It's Metal Gear Online scene expansion

2544
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Three brand new maps

2545
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Coming to the game

2546
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Two new characters are going to be coming as well

2547
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Raiden and Vamp apparently are the new characters

2548
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
That you're going to see in the Metal Gear Online

2549
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Also some new special gear

2550
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Which I think is kind of funny because now you can

2551
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Apparently wear a bikini if you want

2552
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Or you can dress yourself up in clown face or whatever

2553
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Or you can wear the head of

2554
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Robbie the Rabbit if you want to be extra creepy

2555
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
That would be from Silent Hill

2556
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So there you go

2557
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Or if you just want to encourage people to shoot you I don't know

2558
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Also there's going to be a brand new game type

2559
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Of Metal Gear Online

2560
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
It's free if you get the pack or not

2561
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
It's solo capture

2562
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
It's just like team capture

2563
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
But you know you're by yourself

2564
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Because it's solo capture

2565
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
This expansion will cost you $9.99

2566
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
If you want to get all the costumes and the characters

2567
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
And all that stuff

2568
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Yep there you go

2569
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Pre-order start on the 10th

2570
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
And there's some screenshots floating around the internet there

2571
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Some other items

2572
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
You can get a visor for Raiden

2573
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Etc, etc

2574
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I don't know anyone that plays Metal Gear Online

2575
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
But I bet it has a pretty rabid community

2576
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Because I can't think of many games like it

2577
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
So there you go

2578
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Alright let's move on with some more gaming news

2579
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Well I would say this also doubles as pet news

2580
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Well I would say this also doubles as pet news

2581
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Um, Etsy

2582
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Which is a site that has all kinds of sellers

2583
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
That sell cute hand crafts

2584
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
And clothes and stuff like that

2585
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
There is um

2586
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
A series of

2587
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Cat toys

2588
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Um, they look like controllers

2589
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
They have one that's a um

2590
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Guitar Hero controller

2591
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
They have a Wiimote

2592
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Um, a Gameboy

2593
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
An old school Gameboy

2594
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Like the brick

2595
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
They have a 360 controller

2596
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
And a uh

2597
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
NES controller

2598
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
And they look like they're made out of felt

2599
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
And they are for the kitties

2600
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
They're so cute

2601
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I was gonna say and above all

2602
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
They're just cute

2603
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Adorable for little kitties

2604
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I have to show this picture to the chat room

2605
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Uh, might Shermie be getting one of these?

2606
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
No

2607
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
She don't play with any of the shit I buy her

2608
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
You know what she plays with?

2609
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
She plays with twist ties

2610
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Nice

2611
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
How about your kitty, Loki?

2612
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
I know you got a kitty a couple years ago

2613
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Is this something that my cat would play with?

2614
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
No, she'd probably look at it and go

2615
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Does she still play with like that stick?

2616
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Uh

2617
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Oh, like the feather and stuff?

2618
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Yeah, she loves the feather

2619
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
No, her thing right now, what she's been doing

2620
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Um, she likes it when we make her tents

2621
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Or like little forts on the couch

2622
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Like every time we go to bed now

2623
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
We build her a fort

2624
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Using the blankets on the couch

2625
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
And she loves that

2626
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
She's really easy to

2627
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Um, entertain

2628
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
She likes the milk rings

2629
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
You know, the little rings on the uh, milk cartons

2630
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Shermie likes those too

2631
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Yeah, she has like 90 of them in the house

2632
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
And there's like, she dumps them all in her food

2633
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
And water for some reason, I'm not sure why

2634
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
But

2635
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I don't know

2636
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
She's making tea, making plastic tea

2637
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I guess

2638
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I always say Shermie puts her food in her water bowl

2639
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Because she wants tea, or gravy

2640
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I want a kitty, I don't have any cute kitty stories like you guys do

2641
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I want a kitty

2642
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
The roommate doesn't want a kitty though, so I'll have to wait

2643
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
But, someday

2644
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Oh well

2645
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Um, now

2646
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Not necessarily something for Kat

2647
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
But um, the Playstation Network

2648
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Um, Sony is I guess

2649
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Trying to make this more like

2650
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
The Virtual Console

2651
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Now, the rumor is I guess that

2652
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
They're going to try to

2653
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Put more

2654
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Non-PS1 titles on the

2655
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Playstation Network

2656
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
No word on exactly

2657
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Um

2658
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
What systems they're talking about

2659
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
It's got to be arcade games

2660
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
It's got to be, just through process of elimination

2661
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
They can't put Nintendo games on there

2662
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
It would be pointless then to put Sega games on there

2663
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Now that they have that collection out

2664
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Maybe they could strike a deal for TurboGrafx games

2665
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Or something, but I'm thinking arcade games

2666
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
You know, we have like Mortal Kombat 2 on Playstation Network

2667
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Right? So, I'm thinking arcade games

2668
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Yeah

2669
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Um, yeah basically

2670
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
They're promising more PS1 titles

2671
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
And also more pre-PS1

2672
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Retro titles

2673
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
So I'm guessing those will be the arcade games

2674
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
You can't really play

2675
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Games like Mortal Kombat

2676
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Over the PSP thing, right?

2677
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Because I remember Mortal Kombat 2 was one of the first games

2678
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
That came out on Playstation Network, but you can play it on the PS3

2679
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
But you can't play that on the PSP, can you?

2680
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
It doesn't have that whole functionality, does it?

2681
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
You can't play like multiplayer over

2682
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Wi-Fi or anything like that

2683
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
The emulator that it uses to run those

2684
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Doesn't work that way

2685
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Yeah, any Playstation 1 games

2686
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
That are on the PS3

2687
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Can be played on the PSP

2688
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I don't know if Mortal Kombat 2 counts, though

2689
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I'm talking specifically that one

2690
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
That might have been an Xbox

2691
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Like a Playstation Network game

2692
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
So that might not work

2693
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
But if it's a PS1 classic title

2694
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Then yes, that can be ported over

2695
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
If I would get a memory card for my PSP

2696
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I could play sweet code on the go

2697
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
But anyhow

2698
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Going on to a completely different note here

2699
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
This story has to do

2700
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
With censorship

2701
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Who doesn't love censorship, right?

2702
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Although, I don't know if you could

2703
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Directly say it's like censorship

2704
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
But apparently, over in New Zealand

2705
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
There's a guy

2706
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
That wants to actually

2707
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I guess

2708
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Jail adults who allow their kids

2709
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
To play video games that are violent

2710
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Yeah, this is according to

2711
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Chief Censor Bill Hastings

2712
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
From New Zealand

2713
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
You might think the offense is silly

2714
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
But it ain't

2715
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Apparently, if you were to, let's say, let your kid

2716
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Play a violent video game

2717
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Shoot him up, blow some hookers in Grand Theft Auto

2718
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Whatever

2719
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Apparently, if you were the parent

2720
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
You let your kid play this game

2721
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
You could face up to three months in prison

2722
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Or a $10,000 fine

2723
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
This law is set up to send a message

2724
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
How about

2725
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Just let people raise their children?

2726
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
The way they want

2727
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
To read something like that, I'm like

2728
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
A big brother is watching you, how are they gonna catch you?

2729
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Are they gonna be watching me in my house

2730
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Or rely on people, tattling on other people?

2731
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
This doesn't make sense at all

2732
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Dan and I had a conversation about this earlier today, actually

2733
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Really?

2734
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
That we actually wouldn't mind if our kids play violent games

2735
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
As long as, you know, we balanced it

2736
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
And had, you know, talks to them

2737
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And everything

2738
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
We're actually going to do it

2739
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Intelligently

2740
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
There's no way

2741
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
You can just

2742
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Shield and shelter them all the time

2743
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Or else they don't grow up to be balanced

2744
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Individuals

2745
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
You know

2746
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
GS68 in chat says

2747
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Parents, not government, should be in charge of what their kids play

2748
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I think a very well-rounded statement

2749
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Interesting though

2750
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
So you would probably let your kids play

2751
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Violent video games, I don't know

2752
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I'd probably play it with them

2753
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Well no, I would play it with them

2754
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
In the right context

2755
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I think it would be alright

2756
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I'm trying to think about myself

2757
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Maybe someday I'll have a kid somehow or whatever

2758
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
But I don't know if

2759
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Part of me says

2760
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
If you don't let them play it

2761
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
They're going to find a way to do it

2762
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
And you're right, if you're not the one playing it with them

2763
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Then they might not get it in the right context

2764
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
If that makes sense

2765
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Well on top of that, and this goes true for just about anybody

2766
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Child, adult, whatever

2767
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
The things that people are not allowed to do

2768
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Tend to be the things

2769
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
That they want to do just because they're not allowed to

2770
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Do you know what I mean?

2771
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Like for

2772
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I'll use this as an example

2773
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
There's a method of eating called the intuitive diet

2774
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Where you don't

2775
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Disallow yourself anything to eat

2776
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Because that increases your craving for it

2777
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Because you're fixated on finding everything but that

2778
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
But meanwhile the thing that you want is fixated

2779
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
But you can't have it

2780
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
But you really want it

2781
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
So when you do have it, you just go all out

2782
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Well, you know, the same

2783
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
The sort of logic

2784
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Applies to just about anything that people are told they can't do

2785
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Like, okay

2786
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
For example

2787
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Let's actually use the recent

2788
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Prop 8 crap

2789
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
People are told they can't do something, what happens?

2790
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
People come out and force and protest it, right?

2791
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
And people

2792
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
They get it done

2793
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
While they can't or find other ways to get it done

2794
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
That's what I'm saying is that

2795
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
It's there, you know what I mean?

2796
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Whenever someone says you can't do something

2797
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
That's a very big part of human nature

2798
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
That indignation that someone has

2799
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
The audacity to tell you you can't do something

2800
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
You know?

2801
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Ever since we were little kids, don't you agree, Rob?

2802
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Oh yeah, I mean, you know, and it's funny

2803
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Because, you know, sometimes for laughs I'll go read

2804
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
You know, specifically you're talking about Prop 8

2805
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Which obviously is an issue I'm quite passionate about

2806
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
If you don't know why, you know, you need to listen to the show more

2807
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
But here's the thing

2808
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Is that I'll sometimes follow it on one of the local news sites

2809
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Where people can comment on it

2810
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
A lot of comments I see are

2811
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
They report on this issue too much

2812
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
It seems like every day you're reporting on some protest

2813
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
That's because people are not going to shut up

2814
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
About this, ever

2815
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
You take away people's rights

2816
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
They're not going to be happy about it

2817
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
We're not going to shut up

2818
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Until it's equal

2819
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
But my point was

2820
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I know, I'm sorry, I got on a tangent

2821
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
But no, that actually has to go with what I was saying

2822
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Is that you tell people they can't do something

2823
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
And that's going to rise up indignation

2824
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
You know, people

2825
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Don't want to be controlled

2826
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
People don't want to be told no

2827
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
People, you know

2828
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
And the reason why I'm comparing

2829
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Something as strong as a civil rights movement

2830
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
To something as arbitrary as food

2831
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
You know

2832
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Is that it all comes from the same

2833
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
The same sort of

2834
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
You know, even if you may not consciously recognize it

2835
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
It all comes from

2836
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Someone's telling me no

2837
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I don't want to be told no

2838
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I can have this if I want to

2839
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
It's a necessity

2840
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
You know what I mean

2841
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And I think that's why

2842
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
People have a problem with

2843
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Bad language because we're taught

2844
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
That it's bad and that we shouldn't say it

2845
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
So what do you think

2846
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
The first thing that people learn in other languages

2847
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Is curse words

2848
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Don't be gay Sparky, don't be gay

2849
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Or

2850
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
You know, why do you think little kids

2851
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Think it's so awesome to go and sneak around

2852
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
And do stuff behind their parents' back

2853
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Because they know their parents are gonna make a big deal

2854
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Out of it, it's part of its attention too

2855
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Or, you know, why is it that people

2856
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Get, you know

2857
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Let's rate this very R, why do people get turned on

2858
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Doing it in places that they know they're not supposed to

2859
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Seriously

2860
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Like the couple who was doing the

2861
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Whoa

2862
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
No, for real, there was a contest that was going around

2863
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
About, you know, who could do it

2864
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
In what area, and there were points you'd get

2865
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
For touching

2866
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Oh, wasn't that a big radio contest?

2867
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
That was the thing that got them kicked off the air, right

2868
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Where they had sex in a church or something

2869
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Yeah, yeah, I remember that

2870
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
But why would it be such a big deal if they weren't allowed

2871
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Because you're not supposed to have sex in a house of God

2872
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Exactly

2873
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
When you're yelling, oh God, oh God, that's not praying

2874
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
So, really

2875
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Where would the allure be

2876
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Of the kid sneaking around behind his parents' back

2877
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
If there's no harm in it

2878
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
If the parents are gonna be like

2879
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Okay

2880
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Do you see what my logic is?

2881
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
No, I get it

2882
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I'm gonna be like that with my kid

2883
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
It's not that I'm gonna

2884
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I'm going to teach them the right and wrong

2885
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
But video games are video games

2886
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
My whole plan is to teach them the difference between

2887
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Reality and unreality

2888
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
And I also don't care if they curse

2889
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Alright, obviously

2890
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
This is soliciting a huge

2891
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Response from chat

2892
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I wanna read some of the chat comments we have here

2893
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Game Guru says

2894
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I'll allow my kid to play any game

2895
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
If it's rated for older people

2896
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Superdude says no flower for my kids

2897
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Can't play a game

2898
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
As tame as flower

2899
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
SSJ100Matt says

2900
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Jamie will teach your kids to play pinball

2901
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Hell fuck yeah

2902
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
AcidicVampire says

2903
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
And all the lyrics to Pinball Wizard

2904
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
AcidicVampire says Jamie wants to play manhunt with her kids

2905
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
No, I wanna play good games with my kids

2906
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
GS68 says

2907
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
If your kids can differentiate between reality and fantasy

2908
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
At an early age, by all means, let them play

2909
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Game Guru says

2910
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Government is full of idiots

2911
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
And I don't want idiots to raise kids

2912
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
DeakMan

2913
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Has an interesting plan in chat

2914
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com

2915
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Live on Sunday night says

2916
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
When my girl gets older

2917
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
I plan on setting up an NES in her room

2918
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
And only letting her play NES games for two months

2919
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Then SNES for two months

2920
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
And so on

2921
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
So she gets an appreciation for classics

2922
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Maybe

2923
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Maybe I also have this expectation

2924
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
That my child will be like me and my husband were

2925
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
And not be stupid

2926
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Because I've watched all kinds of crap

2927
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
And played all kinds of crap

2928
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
And as long as I

2929
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
As long as the difference was

2930
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I don't think a five year old should play Silent Hill

2931
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Right

2932
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
But what five year old is gonna be interested

2933
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
In Silent Hill

2934
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Right

2935
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
But like, you know, when I was

2936
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
For example, I don't look at it any different

2937
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
As me being allowed to read

2938
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
The books I was allowed to read as a child

2939
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
You know

2940
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
The Scarlet Letter had to do

2941
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
With, you know

2942
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
A woman conceiving an

2943
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Illegitimate child by having an affair

2944
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
How old were we when we read this?

2945
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
You know

2946
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
How about the Grapes of Wrath dealing with

2947
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
You know, the depression

2948
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
That's certainly an adult theme

2949
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I read Atlas Shrugged when I was in ninth grade

2950
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
You know, that actually

2951
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Deals with a lot of sex

2952
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Catcher in the Rye is like the quintessential

2953
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Sophomore year of high school book

2954
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Right? I never read it

2955
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
A lot of kids around here

2956
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
I read The Odyssey

2957
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
When I was in middle school

2958
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I read The Inferno when I was in middle school

2959
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Alright

2960
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
But I look at it

2961
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
It's gotta be down to the parent's

2962
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Judgment. I look at it the same way

2963
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
And yeah, they're classic books

2964
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Whatever people

2965
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Situations dealt with are

2966
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
For a different level

2967
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Of intellect and maturity

2968
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
And certainly, if I don't detect

2969
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
The level of maturity that I think is gonna

2970
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Be able to handle that

2971
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Then, I'm, you know, I'm not

2972
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Going to be the one to introduce it to them

2973
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
You know what I mean?

2974
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
If it comes out that, yeah

2975
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I was at my friend's house and I saw

2976
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
This thing, then I'll be like, okay

2977
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Well, let's have a talk. You know, that's not real

2978
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Right? Okay, don't do that

2979
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Let's get some chat comments. This is a great discussion

2980
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Breslull says, Jamie read Playboy

2981
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Too. I don't know about that

2982
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
For the articles, though, right?

2983
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Bochikawa in chat says, Catcher in the Rye is like 6th grade now

2984
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
They grow up so fast

2985
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Dan Shadow says, you know with all these rainbows

2986
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
And unicorns, 5 year olds will really be into

2987
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Diablo 3

2988
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Possibly

2989
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Alright, some more serious comments in chat

2990
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Deathwishing says, I personally think it's good

2991
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
To show kids M-rated games

2992
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Because it shows like Grand Theft Auto

2993
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Because it shows them that if they do something wrong

2994
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
They get fucked by the police

2995
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I don't know about that

2996
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
And what people are taking out of context

2997
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
There was an XD after that

2998
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
So I think there was a little tongue in cheek

2999
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
But I also think that what some people are taking out of context

3000
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Is that I'm not gonna take

3001
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
A 5 year old, like I said

3002
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
And play Silent Hill with them

3003
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
It's a lot of it is parents

3004
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Discretion

3005
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
And, you know, like when

3006
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
When my little sister, okay

3007
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
My little sister was little, little

3008
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
We played video games with her

3009
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
You know, to those days it was

3010
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Nintendo and Super Nintendo, but we sat down

3011
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
And played with her

3012
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
And, you know, she knew what was real

3013
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
And what wasn't, like she knew that if she

3014
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Sat on a sewer pipe, she likely wouldn't go into

3015
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
A cavern with gold coins

3016
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
You know

3017
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
There's

3018
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
There's a difference, you know, you just have to

3019
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Trust sometimes that

3020
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
The kids are smarter than you give them credit for

3021
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
And I actually had this discussion

3022
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
With Dan's stepmother

3023
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
And I'm not gonna go into too detailed, but I was like

3024
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
We can't expect the government to do

3025
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
A parent's job for them

3026
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
The parent's responsibility

3027
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Is to that child until they are

3028
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Of age and can leave

3029
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
From

3030
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
A person is a parent before

3031
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Conception

3032
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
That's how I see it

3033
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
A couple last comments from chat here

3034
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
And then we'll try to go ahead and move on for tonight

3035
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
We're having a good discussion, and I'm sure we'll probably get some emails

3036
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
About this one, can't wait

3037
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Superdude in chat says, if kids can get their hands

3038
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Into R-rated movies, it's not that hard

3039
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
For them to get the M-rated games either

3040
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Kids will always find a way to get the M-rated games

3041
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Because they know M-rated games are the shit

3042
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Deathwishing in chat

3043
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Last comment here I'm gonna read

3044
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
I play video games and I haven't killed anything except

3045
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Ants, fucking ants

3046
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
There you go

3047
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Alright, if you want to join in

3048
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
On our chat sometime

3049
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com

3050
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Live here on a Sunday night

3051
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
But for right now, obviously this oversensorship

3052
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I have to agree with Marissa

3053
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
What did she say?

3054
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
When I was 12 I found my mom's

3055
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
College level human sexuality book

3056
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Only damage it did was give me some very happy

3057
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Boyfriends later in life

3058
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Alright

3059
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Look, we gotta make some time here since

3060
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
We did just read about a really ludicrous

3061
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Story, obviously these types of stories

3062
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Put us into a fit of rage

3063
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
This is the part of the show that we like to call

3064
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
The FUs of the Week

3065
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
My first FU goes to people

3066
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Making assumptions

3067
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
This is

3068
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Directed

3069
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Towards certain people

3070
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
In my house

3071
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Who

3072
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Will not

3073
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Name names

3074
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
And also

3075
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I'd actually have to direct that towards

3076
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Myself too because I've made a couple of

3077
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Assumptions too

3078
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
My second

3079
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
I was about to say my second assumption

3080
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
My second FU

3081
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Actually has to do

3082
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
With semis trying to do

3083
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
U-turns and intersections

3084
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Too small for them

3085
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
And my third one

3086
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Has to do with

3087
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
The Watchmen movie

3088
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
It should have been a fucking miniseries, not a movie

3089
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
That means I didn't like it

3090
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
I just meant the story

3091
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Would have been better told through a miniseries

3092
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
You just wanted more of it

3093
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I wanted it better paced

3094
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I'll put it that way

3095
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
It needed better pacing

3096
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Alright, I don't really have a lot of FUs

3097
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I guess FU to Daylight Savings Time

3098
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Does that really screw it up my weekend

3099
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Otherwise, just an FU to the fact

3100
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
That I'm flying to Washington DC this

3101
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Week and I'm only going to be there for a day

3102
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I'm flying there on Tuesday

3103
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I'm going to be there Wednesday, I'm flying back on Thursday

3104
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
So FU to not getting to spend quality time

3105
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
In a far away town

3106
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
FU to Couple Stones because they suck to walk on

3107
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
They're round and awkward

3108
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Round and awkward

3109
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Fair enough

3110
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
That's going to do it for the FUs of the Week

3111
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Segment we've done for the past

3112
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Many, many years here on Orange Lounge Radio

3113
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Let's get back into some gaming news

3114
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
We do have the mailbag coming up and the Skype line

3115
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Soon enough as well where we'll be taking your calls

3116
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
1877 Game OLR

3117
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
But not just yet, we'll let you know when the phones are open

3118
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
We do still have some more stories we want to get to before then

3119
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Right, Jamie?

3120
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Yes, and this one's about Penny Arcade

3121
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Washington State has passed a bill

3122
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Which is pretty much like Damn You Guys Rock

3123
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
To the Penny Arcade founders

3124
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Jerry Hulkins and Mike Krahulik

3125
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Is that how it's pronounced?

3126
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
But basically they were honored for their contribution

3127
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
To their state's industry

3128
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Because there are about

3129
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
48 video game companies

3130
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
In Washington

3131
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
And also they run

3132
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
A really, really excellent

3133
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Charity, the Child's Play

3134
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Which has raised over 4.5 million dollars

3135
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
For children's hospitals

3136
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
So very good

3137
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
And they also bring people to the state

3138
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Like Penny Arcade Expo does

3139
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Yeah, and just obviously

3140
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Yeah, Penny Arcade Expo is probably a huge

3141
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Economy boost for the state

3142
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Especially for the restaurants

3143
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
And the bars

3144
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
They're very happy about that

3145
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Well, you may remember me talking about

3146
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Eat, Lead, The Return of Matt Hazard

3147
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
A game that came out

3148
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
A couple weeks ago, actually last week

3149
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
And kind of

3150
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Was a parody on the old

3151
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Video game genre

3152
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Everything from old

3153
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Shareware games

3154
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
You know, RPGs and that kind of stuff

3155
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Well now, they have a

3156
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
New Flash game that you can try out

3157
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
That actually recreates one of these

3158
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Fictional games in

3159
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
The history of Matt Hazard

3160
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
And the game of course

3161
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Is Matt Hazard

3162
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
In Land Extreme

3163
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Alpha Advance

3164
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
And it's a

3165
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Game you can check out at

3166
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
MattHazardExtreme.com

3167
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Kind of a parody of a 16-bit

3168
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Game

3169
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
And they have a nice photo of Matt Hazard

3170
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Destroying what looks like a robotic

3171
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Pegasus

3172
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Huh

3173
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
You know, Dan Shadow in chat says

3174
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Matt Hazard is not good, quite simply

3175
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Um

3176
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Were you a fan of Eat, Lead, eventually?

3177
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
I know a couple weeks ago we were playing it

3178
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
It was okay, it wasn't great

3179
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
The game itself is funny, but the way it

3180
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Plays is kinda crap

3181
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
So it's just, it's not

3182
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I don't know, it was like

3183
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
A good idea on paper and then they tried to

3184
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Make it and it just wasn't working

3185
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
It didn't work

3186
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Well, one game that's worked for some people, I know this game

3187
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Has their fans, I'm gonna be honest, I've never played this game

3188
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
But Eve Online does have a very

3189
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Rabid fan base, I know we have a couple callers that play this game

3190
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Um, online, hey guess what?

3191
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
There is an expansion coming out, I'm sure the fans

3192
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Of the game must know this, it's Eve Online

3193
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
And I'm probably gonna butcher the name

3194
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Of this, but it's Apokripa

3195
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Apokripa? I don't know how exactly

3196
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
You say that, Apokripa

3197
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Apokripa, I don't know how you say that

3198
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
But that is the expansion that's

3199
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Coming out this week, and apparently

3200
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
It's gonna kinda change some things about the game

3201
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
If you're a new player in the game

3202
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
You get some new epic mission arcs that are

3203
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Gonna help guide you through the different factions

3204
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
In the Eve Online game, and so this means it's gonna be

3205
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
A little more new player friendly, probably to

3206
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Address some of those things that Eve Online is too damn

3207
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Difficult, or I've heard a lot of people have gotten into

3208
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
This game and they get blown away because I guess the whole thing

3209
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Is PVP, so this will kinda help

3210
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
But if you're a veteran player and you wanna get into

3211
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
This game, there will be some new wormholes

3212
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
That are gonna show up in the game

3213
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
And you'll get some new enemies and some new items

3214
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
And things of that nature

3215
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
The enemies will now change their tactics

3216
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Based on your performance

3217
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
They might even call in backup, change

3218
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Some targets, use debuffs

3219
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Whatever they're gonna have to do to

3220
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Blow you up

3221
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
So check out that Eve Online expansion

3222
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
For Apokripa

3223
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
A-P-O-C-R-Y-P-H-A

3224
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Apokripa

3225
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Apokripa, that sounds right, Apokripa

3226
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
There you go

3227
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Uh, Eve Online coming out soon

3228
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Coming up right now, the Orange Lounge Radio

3229
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Mailbag, every week you guys send us your emails

3230
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
At mailbag.orangeloungeradio.com

3231
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
We pick a few of our favorites and read them live

3232
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Here on the show, so DarkSakura

3233
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Why don't you dive into the mailbag

3234
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Mailbag.orangeloungeradio.com

3235
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Pick out some emails and reinforce us

3236
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Right now

3237
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Well, do I gotta?

3238
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Yes you do

3239
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
First email is

3240
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Hello to everyone

3241
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
At the Orange Lounge, including random guests

3242
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
If there is one this week

3243
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
That would just be Harvey, who is invisible

3244
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Or Pikachu, if you're watching Justin TV

3245
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
We do have Pikachu and he's armed with a sword tonight

3246
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Which Loki's kind of sitting in front of us

3247
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
He can't really see, but he does have a sword

3248
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
That's Pimp and Pikachu

3249
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
That's right, with his pimp hat tonight

3250
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
The other week you were talking about British tele

3251
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
It wasn't worth watching on the BBC

3252
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
If you can access the BBC iPlayer

3253
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Please, please, please make some time to watch

3254
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
A phenomenal new series called Being Human

3255
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
It's about a vampire, werewolf, and a ghost

3256
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
That share a house in Bristol

3257
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
It really is the best thing on TV at the moment

3258
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
It was Master Chef

3259
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
But that's finished now

3260
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
I would love to know your thoughts

3261
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I feel like I should inject something

3262
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Game related here, so here's my gaming week

3263
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Slash month

3264
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
COD World at War on the Wii

3265
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Tony the Tiger says it's great

3266
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Not sure if Tony the Tiger owns a Wii though

3267
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I'm going now, bye, love from Chard

3268
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Age 23 and a half

3269
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
No wait, I'm nearly 33, fuck

3270
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Where did that come from?

3271
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
That is what the email said, by the way

3272
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Which was beautiful

3273
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Wow, the next one's big

3274
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Thank you spazzinator

3275
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Hi folks, if you three didn't mind

3276
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I have a few questions for you

3277
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
First of all, as of right now

3278
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I'm trying to change up

3279
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
How my 360 Elite is hooked up to my TV

3280
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Mainly for convenience sake

3281
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
More than anything

3282
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
However, I'm running into issues

3283
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Right now it's hooked up to my 32 inch

3284
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
1080i HD TV via component cables

3285
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
That like to be hooked up by HDMI

3286
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
And passing through an HDMI switch

3287
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
On its way to my TV

3288
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
As nearly as I can tell, it should be a no brainer

3289
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
All this

3290
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
All this seating seems correct

3291
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
And it's just a matter of swapping cables

3292
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
However, every time I do attempt to switch my TV

3293
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
It tells me it's receiving an invalid signal

3294
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
I read the 360's instructions

3295
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
And it seems like I'm doing everything right

3296
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Am I overlooking something obvious here

3297
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Before you say it, I know I won't see an improvement

3298
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
In picture, I'd just like to

3299
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Like the convenience of using my

3300
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
HDMI switch to switch

3301
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Between my cable box PS3 and PS3

3302
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Um, you said PS3 twice

3303
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Anyone care to tackle that?

3304
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I ran out for just a minute

3305
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
That was the heart of the question

3306
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Because I wanted to get a refill on my coffee

3307
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Something about not getting the right picture?

3308
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
He wants to hook up his Xbox 360

3309
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Elite through the HDMI switch

3310
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
But it's getting an invalid signal

3311
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Um

3312
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Hmm

3313
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
I'm not sure, this might be a question

3314
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Better left for a Best Buy employee

3315
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Do you have any thoughts, Loki?

3316
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I'm not sure, it's okay

3317
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
You should just hook it up and it should work

3318
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Yeah, it should just kind of work

3319
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
It should be via component cables

3320
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
But I want it to be hooked up by HDMI

3321
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
But it should be a no brainer

3322
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Yeah, it should be a no brainer

3323
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Every time I do attempt it, my switch TV says I'm getting an invalid signal

3324
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Try new cables

3325
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Yeah, it's gotta be the switch, the cable

3326
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Something weird's going on there

3327
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
You're right, it should be a no brainer

3328
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
It ought to just work

3329
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Should just be able to plug it in and go

3330
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Um, some thoughts from our chat room

3331
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Because of course when we can't think of the answer

3332
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Usually our chatters can

3333
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Because Microsoft wants you to buy a new cable

3334
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
AcidicVampire says you might have to use a

3335
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Microsoft HDMI cable

3336
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Nah, it doesn't matter, it's just an HDMI cable

3337
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
But it sounds like, I don't know, some issue

3338
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
If you've got cheap cables though

3339
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Then that might be the problem

3340
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
We actually pretty much use them

3341
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I think we pretty much stick with the monster cables at my house

3342
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Monsters, crap

3343
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
But just any HDMI cable

3344
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Maybe that one doesn't

3345
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I don't know if you've used that HDMI cable on anything else

3346
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Maybe I've had issues

3347
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
It might be just poor shielded or something

3348
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
For some reason it's getting the wrong signal

3349
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
To it

3350
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
There's another thing you can do

3351
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Maybe with it hooked up

3352
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Where you can reset the

3353
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Your video settings

3354
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
On it and you might try that

3355
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Maybe booting up with the HDMI cable

3356
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
I think you hold

3357
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I want to say it's either the right shoulder button

3358
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Or the right trigger and why

3359
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
While you're booting up the system

3360
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I'm sure if you look on Game Facts or something like that

3361
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
One of them will reset the video

3362
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
The other will format your hard drive

3363
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
No, one will not format your hard drive

3364
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
That's something different

3365
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
That's a reset

3366
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
There's another one to reset your cache also

3367
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Yeah, I think it's

3368
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
The shoulder button or the right trigger

3369
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
It's one of those and why

3370
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Oh, is the little thing on the

3371
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Oh no, it doesn't, nevermind

3372
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I'm thinking the little switch on the back of the core

3373
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
And it's also important that you have to turn on your console

3374
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
With your controller if you do that

3375
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
But

3376
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
I don't know why that would affect anything

3377
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
But maybe you could try that and see if that works

3378
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Other thoughts from our chat

3379
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Again, thank you guys very much

3380
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
SSJ100Matt suggested he update it

3381
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Because they just updated the HDMI on Xbox Live

3382
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
AcidicVampire says

3383
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I tried a generic cable and it didn't work

3384
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
But it works on my Playstation 3

3385
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Dan Shadow says don't buy monsters

3386
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
SSJ100Matt says I got an HDMI cable

3387
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
For less than a dollar and it works great

3388
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Tony Tony Tony suggests

3389
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
HDMI input

3390
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Cablewholesale.com, that's a good place

3391
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
To check for cables on HDMI

3392
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I think this might be the best advice yet

3393
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
TigerClaw suggests maybe it's a handshake issue

3394
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
The HDMI switch must support

3395
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
HDCP

3396
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
So maybe the switch is not

3397
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Good enough, that's a good thought

3398
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
And then lastly

3399
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Another thing to test, SSJ100Matt says

3400
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Try plugging the HDMI cable directly into the TV

3401
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
And then a recruit

3402
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Who has not changed their name

3403
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
They need to make sure their 360 is configured correctly

3404
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
So wow, that's like a million different options

3405
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Hope it works out for you buddy

3406
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Let us know what happens

3407
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Next part

3408
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
In regards to last week's story about the lesbian

3409
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
That got banned from Xbox Live after reporting being

3410
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Harassed by others

3411
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
I have a bit of an odd nagging question which honestly

3412
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
I'm surprised no one else has asked

3413
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Not to suggest in any way shape or form

3414
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
That Microsoft or the bullies were right

3415
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
They obviously weren't by a long shot

3416
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
But what exactly is the point of

3417
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
One's orientation on one's online profile

3418
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
On either Xbox Live or PSN

3419
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Granted, I'm still fairly

3420
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
New to the whole Xbox Live scene and all

3421
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
But as nearly as I can tell the bio section

3422
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Of Xbox Live profile is geared

3423
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
To inputting info about yourself

3424
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
That's gaming or gamer lifestyle related

3425
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Such as what systems you

3426
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Own, what game genre

3427
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Players

3428
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
How long one has been gaming, etc

3429
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I don't see how one's orientation

3430
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Regardless of what it is has anything to do with gaming

3431
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
True

3432
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
As I stated on the show last year

3433
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
The one where there was a talk about the so called offensive

3434
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Retooling of space invaders for the art

3435
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
commentary purposes

3436
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
I'm all for the first amendment rights

3437
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Regardless of whether or not others are offended

3438
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
But somehow talk of one's orientation

3439
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
On Xbox Live seems a bit out of place

3440
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Although it's not perfect

3441
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
The only analogy that comes to mind

3442
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
At the moment would be like

3443
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Going to an AA meeting and talking about all things

3444
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

3445
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
With the analogy AA meetings are for dealing

3446
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
With alcoholic issues not TMNT

3447
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
And as nearly as I figure

3448
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Bios on Xbox Live profile are meant to be gaming

3449
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Related

3450
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Am I missing something here? Am I way

3451
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Off the mark or missing the point here?

3452
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I do hope that she

3453
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Gets her profile back and that she's not turned off

3454
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
From online gaming

3455
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Frankly even though there are A holes

3456
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Online gaming on Xbox Live or PSN

3457
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Can be a lot of fun

3458
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I kind of get what

3459
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
It's Spaz who sent the emailer

3460
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
I kind of get what Spaz is saying here

3461
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
About the whole like you know why did she

3462
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Even need to say it in the first place and you know

3463
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I don't get it, you don't get it

3464
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I don't think any of us really understand why she has to

3465
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Say it but at the same time

3466
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
If that's what she wants to do

3467
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
If that's what she wants to put in her profile

3468
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Shouldn't she be able to put it?

3469
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
I mean it's not like she put I like to stab kittens in the face

3470
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
She's a lesbian

3471
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
I wonder though if

3472
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
I love the stab kittens in the face would be

3473
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Considered offensive and if that would get banned

3474
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
You probably would I wouldn't try it

3475
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I mean if that's what she really

3476
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Wants to put in her profile

3477
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Who am I to judge?

3478
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Maybe I should create a profile a silver account

3479
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Or something like that that says I love the stab kittens

3480
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
In the face

3481
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
My profile on Xbox Live says I host a radio show

3482
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
On the internet called Orange Lounge Radio.com

3483
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Oh my god banned

3484
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Do you think half the people that punch me in the face

3485
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
In Street Fighter 4 and just kill me

3486
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
To the ground do you think they give a shit?

3487
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
That I'm another person with a podcast on the internet

3488
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
How many people actually read their profiles?

3489
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Welcome to the Fantasy Zone get ready

3490
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
And do you think

3491
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
99% of the people that you run into

3492
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
On Xbox Live know what the fuck that is?

3493
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Only the old school gamers

3494
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Exactly

3495
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
You know what it's from

3496
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I know what it's from it's from Space Harrier

3497
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Not Fantasy Zone common misconception but still

3498
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
You know what I mean

3499
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Oh completely off topic I actually found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone

3500
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Congrats

3501
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
You're a winner

3502
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
I am

3503
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Ponzi scheme in chat says

3504
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I listened to the interview on Major Nelson's podcast

3505
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Microsoft is being ultra PC with this issue

3506
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Of course

3507
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Of course they have to be ultra PC with this issue

3508
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
They don't want to get the pink mafia

3509
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Sicked on them which I completely understand

3510
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
And obviously

3511
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
I think they realize this situation

3512
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Has been blown completely out of

3513
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Proportion thank you internet

3514
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
But it's something that needs to be addressed

3515
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
So it'll be interesting to see what happens

3516
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
As a result

3517
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Alright ready?

3518
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Next email

3519
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
I'm sorry I have to say this one other comment from Ponzi scheme in chat

3520
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I like Olive Garden's never ending pasta

3521
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Will I get banned for that?

3522
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
No but you might get fat

3523
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Or diarrhea

3524
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Hey OLR crew

3525
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I've listened to your show for the past 3 years or so

3526
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
And I thought it would be nice to give you some thanks

3527
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Thank you for helping me get through my customer service job

3528
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
For entertaining me on long bus rides

3529
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
And for keeping me sane

3530
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Your podcast was the first one I ever listened to

3531
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
And it's one that I look forward to listening to

3532
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Every week

3533
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
There's another reason why I'm sending this email

3534
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
You see I am sick and tired of people sending emails

3535
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
With crappy punctuation, grammar, and spelling

3536
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Laziness is no excuse

3537
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I thought it would be nice for Dark Sakura to finally get

3538
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
A well written nearly error free email for once

3539
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
In addition

3540
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Just for the sake of proof of concept

3541
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
This email is written from my iPod touch with auto correct

3542
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Turned off so you see people

3543
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
It can be done

3544
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I love you

3545
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Alright I'm stepping off my soapbox

3546
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Maybe one day I'll email you with something video game related

3547
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
But that will have to wait for another day

3548
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Midnight skies

3549
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
This presentation of Grammar Nazi has concluded

3550
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
We now return you to your Orange Jones radio already in progress

3551
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Actually I've found no errors

3552
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Congratulations

3553
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
What do you want a cookie?

3554
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Fanfare

3555
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Oh god don't make me dig up the soundboard

3556
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Oh well you were already doing it

3557
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Thank you

3558
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Thank you thank you thank you

3559
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Midnight skies

3560
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
And I think it was Sasa that pointed this out to me before

3561
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
But I tend to read the emails like they're sent to me

3562
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Including you know bad grammar run on sentences and all

3563
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:33,000
So you can tell from the fluid way in which this email was read

3564
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
That it was properly phrased and properly punctuated

3565
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
That it didn't make my heart hurt

3566
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Okay what's the email on his name Midnight Skies

3567
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Midnight Skies

3568
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Congratulations

3569
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
You get a cookie

3570
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:57,000
This email is getting saved never delete it or I'll stab a kitten in the face

3571
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Alright any more emails

3572
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Next

3573
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
This is an inquiry email

3574
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Via orangejonesradio.com

3575
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:09,000
From oh dude we have that cool thing set up don't we

3576
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
What?

3577
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
I guess this is through the website

3578
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Oh no this is me just going

3579
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Okay

3580
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
It's from Irene

3581
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Let's just do the rest of the radio show

3582
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
That was my tribute to Irene the fart princess

3583
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Hey there OLR crew this be Lexo and Yo

3584
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Or Leoxon Lao Shen

3585
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:33,000
I think it's Leo Shen that's what I've always said

3586
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
First of all

3587
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:39,000
First off I'd like to say that OLR has got to be my favorite video game show of all time

3588
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
That aside

3589
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Recently on your show I've heard the constant complaint that industry fighter force Seth

3590
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
The final boss is a cheap bitch

3591
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I'd like to show you all a fighting game boss that is even worse than Seth

3592
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Someone with the definition of a cheap bitch in fighting games who has the dreaded SNK boss syndrome times 10

3593
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Okay so I need to take a look at this

3594
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Oh fuck

3595
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:09,000
I'd like to mention that the boss in Tatsunoko vs Capcom is also a cheap bitch

3596
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Yes

3597
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,000
We are looking at a video here in studio of a fight from Arcana Heart 2

3598
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
That's brand new

3599
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
And I'm trying to, the video is buffering

3600
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
It's all chick fighting

3601
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Well that's not anything new

3602
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Alright

3603
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Alright so yes I'm looking at this boss fight

3604
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Yes we're watching

3605
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
It's pretty

3606
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
I mean I can't falter for that

3607
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
She's way too covered though

3608
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
At least the one on the left is

3609
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
So the video is a little bit of a low quality

3610
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
That's what I was saying, the one on the right

3611
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Alright anyway I'm sorry

3612
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Exactly that's what I'm saying

3613
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
That's her bouncy

3614
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Alright sorry what's the rest of the email

3615
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:53,000
I'm actually just watching the, oh my god, cheap bitch much

3616
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Damn

3617
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Okay so

3618
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:01,000
They have a special pink controller that you can get for this

3619
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Who cares I want it

3620
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
I want this game

3621
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
I think I'm gonna have to get this game

3622
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Alright

3623
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:13,000
So anyway, back to the email that was currently in progress

3624
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:17,000
She happens to come from the all girl fighter called Sugoi Arcana Heart 2

3625
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Sugoi means wow

3626
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Her name is

3627
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
I think that's what Loki said when he saw those boobies

3628
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Her name is Paraslycia

3629
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,000
And she just happens to be an elven woman who can summon four elemental spheres to take you down

3630
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
What makes her so bad you may ask

3631
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Well first off she has an auto regen super meter

3632
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Some special attacks that when they connect it spells an instant 70% or more off your health depleted

3633
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Has a special where she can restore most of her health and you can't really stop her from doing it all too well

3634
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:51,000
And she has a nasty little instant kill ultra move as demonstrated over and over in the video included

3635
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:56,000
She also has a bit jiggle of her breasts when she unleashes her special moves

3636
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Although to some people that wouldn't hurt to see when their ass is handed to them

3637
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
We did notice that emailer

3638
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:06,000
She can be beaten but you need some mad skills to do so

3639
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
The video shows her on normal mode

3640
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I can honestly say that she's just as bad on easier modes

3641
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Imagine if Seth was like that OLR

3642
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I bet some people would have stopped playing Street Fighter 4 arcade mode altogether if Seth was that tough

3643
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Well you know I do have to mention that Seth is sort of like you know wearing just like a thong type thing

3644
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I would be fine if she was just wearing just a thong

3645
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Let her finish

3646
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Well just wanted to show a boss that would make Seth her bitch

3647
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Keep up the great work with the show but Seth does gut suck

3648
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,000
You're fighting game addicted listener Leoshen

3649
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:46,000
P.S. this message is brought to you by Sugoi Arcana Hearts 2

3650
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
It's so good you'll slap your mama

3651
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
And of course I love you mama peace out OLR

3652
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
That was a pretty funny email

3653
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Every other sequel that comes out we should all say Sugoi in front of it

3654
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Like wow

3655
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Hey guys

3656
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Oh sorry I was on the next email

3657
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Dan Shadow in chat says well who doesn't have a jiggle in their breast when unleashing their special

3658
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I can't be the only one without problem

3659
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I think that the next email is from Dan Shadow

3660
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Oh well then let's hear it

3661
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Hey guys Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is one of my most cherished games

3662
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:24,000
After school my friends and I would go to the local pizza place and just rock that arcade

3663
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Every day I hope that a new one will be made

3664
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,000
To get to the point what new Marvel fighters do you think should make it into a new game if one was made today

3665
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Which characters deserve to get scrapped

3666
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
I personally hope Dante from Devil May Cry

3667
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,000
The Bionic Commando and Bucky as Captain America would be in it

3668
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Keep it real guys the cold stone is delicious

3669
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I want Deadpool

3670
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I want Deadpool in the Dan fighting game

3671
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
And he has to

3672
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Could you imagine Deadpool vs. Dan

3673
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:57,000
That would be funny as fuck because it would be taunting back and forth the whole time

3674
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Except Deadpool would pull out a gun

3675
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,000
I don't have the comic book knowledge to really answer that question from the Marvel standpoint

3676
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,000
But from the Capcom standpoint I agree with the Bionic Commando guy with the arm

3677
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
That would be pretty hilarious

3678
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,000
That's a good suggestion

3679
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
He was a helper in the first Marvel vs. Capcom

3680
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:14,000
This is who I would see in my dream

3681
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
From Capcom characters

3682
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:19,000
I would actually totally believe Strider Hiryu in it

3683
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
But I would actually have a palette swap for Hien

3684
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
From Strider 2

3685
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Also you should totally have

3686
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,000
For playable I agree with the new Captain America

3687
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
I agree we should have

3688
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Well I would totally say put Luke Cage in it

3689
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
How about Arthur from Ghouls and Ghosts

3690
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:43,000
He was a helper and I honestly don't see him doing the fighting type

3691
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Unless maybe if he was on a second bard he fought in his underwear

3692
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I was just going to say when he gets down to low life his suit gets knocked off

3693
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Or he has the gold armor during a power up

3694
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I don't know I'm stupid

3695
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
I want Forte

3696
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Or

3697
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Bass

3698
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Rob from Rockman

3699
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Um

3700
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
I also

3701
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
I'd actually like to see Ingrid

3702
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,000
And I definitely want Sakura in the game

3703
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
But um

3704
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
I don't know

3705
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
You could really there's just so much to choose from

3706
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Alright enough fanboy wank

3707
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,000
That's it

3708
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Alright

3709
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Wank wank wank

3710
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Speaking of wank I'm sorry that was wang

3711
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Today

3712
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Oh and the Watchmen movie

3713
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Yeah I've heard I've heard

3714
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Big blue cock

3715
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
I think it's all CGI though

3716
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Actually I will go ahead and tell everybody this who's going to see the movie

3717
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Unless you're like looking at his crotch

3718
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
The cock is not distracting

3719
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Unless you're looking for it

3720
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Cock is always distracting I don't know dark Sakura

3721
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:52,000
It glowed with the rest of him so it was kind of hard to see

3722
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Alright I'm waiting to see the movie on IMAX

3723
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
So I can have you know a six story tall cock

3724
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
That would be

3725
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Is that like Disneyland?

3726
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
It's an IMAX at Eldorado Hills

3727
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Is it really?

3728
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I know they had IMAX out there

3729
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Yeah I know they just added it but um

3730
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Yeah it's playing there

3731
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Alright

3732
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
The Irish gangster in chat says

3733
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
In Soviet Russia cock looks at you

3734
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Do you want six story cock?

3735
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Uh sure

3736
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Do you want to be blue and radioactive?

3737
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Yes please

3738
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Okay

3739
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Alright let's

3740
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Let's get one more story and then we're going to open up the skype line to your calls

3741
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:30,000
At 1-877-GAME-OLR

3742
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Yeah

3743
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:37,000
So let's see there's some possible announcements that are going to happen

3744
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Later this week actually

3745
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Supposedly on March 12th

3746
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Kind of going along with their whole launch event for Resident Evil 5 in San Francisco

3747
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:54,000
There is some evidence suggesting that they're going to announce a brand new Resident Evil title for the Wii

3748
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:00,000
And that Resident Evil title just might be a port or remake of Resident Evil Code Veronica

3749
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:07,000
And apparently there's been a lot of rumors going around saying you know

3750
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Hey if you're a Resident Evil Wii fan we've got some great news for you

3751
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:20,000
And I don't know I mean honestly I didn't think Code Veronica was that great

3752
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:24,000
From what I remember reading as far as reviews go and stuff

3753
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:31,000
I don't know Code Veronica did come out though on the GameCube back in 2003

3754
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:37,000
So maybe they're doing a Resident Evil 4 Wii version type thing for this

3755
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
I don't know maybe just adding the Wii controls to it

3756
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I don't think that would be that exciting if that's what they're doing

3757
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
But maybe a brand new Code Veronica game who knows

3758
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
But maybe a brand new Resident Evil game for the Wii

3759
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Anything I guess is pretty good

3760
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:56,000
AcidicVampire wonders aloud in our chat room why Veronica why not Resident Evil 2

3761
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
I don't know

3762
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Maybe because you know not that many people had a Dreamcast

3763
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:08,000
But compared to the Wii not that many people had a Dreamcast

3764
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:14,000
And the Rob D in chat says the reviews for the Code Veronica were all pretty good on the Dreamcast

3765
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Alright hey if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3766
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
We are going to open up the phone lines right now to take your calls

3767
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Do we have any last minute stories while we're waiting?

3768
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:30,000
I think we hit out almost everything that was in the show roll thread this week

3769
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
But I don't know Loki did anything come up last minute tonight or Dark Soccer?

3770
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Cock

3771
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,000
I waited for you to take a sip I timed it wrong

3772
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Yeah I had coffee

3773
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:44,000
I ran in during that last story because I drank two cups of coffee so you know why I had to run in the house

3774
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Drop head to tinkle

3775
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Yes

3776
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:56,000
I guess like a small thing I guess some of the cars from Burnout are going to be in Godfather 2

3777
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Interesting

3778
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
That doesn't make any sense to me but okay

3779
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Alright we got a call on the line

3780
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this?

3781
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Breslau how you guys doing?

3782
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Breslau damn we haven't heard from you in the show in a long time

3783
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
You know in chat you never shut up but it's nice to hear your actual voice how have you been?

3784
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
I don't know what you're talking about

3785
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
How have you been sir?

3786
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I have been well except for my Xbox Red Ringing which is the complete stem of that little rant I wrote on our news page

3787
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:28,000
But before it Red Ringed a mini review of a game that's been out for a while

3788
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,000
The Sega Sonic Genesis Mega Collection

3789
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Yes

3790
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I don't know if you guys have talked about this

3791
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:40,000
We have we lavished fanboy wank upon it a few weeks ago that's my tip of the evening fanboy wank

3792
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:46,000
It's probably the best bang for your buck on the Xbox right now it's almost 50 games for 30 bucks

3793
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:52,000
And you can get a lot of play out of it you get two shining forces four fantasy stars all the Sonics

3794
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I mean there's at least 80 hours of gameplay in there

3795
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:05,000
What I didn't really like is you can change the video settings but it's only within each game there's not a global setting

3796
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
That gets kind of annoying

3797
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:15,000
The games also just like everything else that's happened with you know old ports they don't look good in 720p

3798
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:20,000
No they don't and you know what though I agree maybe a global setting would be nice

3799
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,000
But you know the game does remember from game to game how you have it set

3800
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:28,000
So some games look better like with that stretched you know faux 16x9 than others

3801
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Other games were not meant to be played in that stretched 16x9

3802
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:35,000
But games like Sonic Spinball actually work really well in the stretched 16x9

3803
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Absolutely I agree with that I mean a lot of those Sonic games look good in 16x9

3804
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:44,000
You know the smoothing feature is probably one of the worst things I've seen

3805
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:48,000
But there's two games that actually look good with them and there's Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles

3806
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:52,000
But overall it's 30 bucks go get it

3807
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Yeah it's not bad I actually reviewed it on Playstation 3 because when I went to get it they didn't have it on 360

3808
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:01,000
So I just said what the hell it's the same game so I got it on Playstation 3 but you know same same

3809
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
And it's a great collection

3810
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Yeah absolutely and if any of you haven't heard I have to plug the other thing I do besides the USO March Madness

3811
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Which the Final Four has been announced blah blah blah

3812
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
You want to tell us what the Final Four is real quick?

3813
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Sure why not the Final Four as of right now are Super Mario Bros. 3 vs. Rock Band

3814
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:30,000
And I know at least one person on the air right now voted Rock Band very protest like

3815
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Yes but that was me just because I wanted revenge on Tetris for it beating Super Metroid

3816
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:40,000
But I still believe Rock Band has no business being in the top four games of all time

3817
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Mario 3 I can see that I can see that

3818
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Well that comes from you know this show's roots as a music game show

3819
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Sure I understand that I understand that it's not please I spent like most of my gaming week playing Rock Band

3820
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:01,000
It's not that I dislike Rock Band by any means but it's no Mario 3 it's no Super Metroid

3821
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
It's no Final Four game and it's no one seed

3822
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Maybe in a couple years it needs to age like a wine a little bit

3823
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Yeah and then the battle of the Super Nintendo games on the other side of the bracket is Chrono Trigger vs. Link to the Past

3824
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Link to the Past almost got beat by Sonic 2 which has been the dark horse of the entire tournament

3825
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Yeah it's been very interesting I don't know how Sonic 2 has been doing

3826
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Who are the Sonic fans that are voting that game up? Nobody's really professed

3827
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I did it a couple rounds but not against Link to the Past not against that

3828
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I didn't do it against Ocarina of Time

3829
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I still have a hard time accepting that Chrono Trigger beat Final Fantasy 6

3830
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:41,000
But that's my own because I love Final Fantasy 6 but I understand there is so much fanboy wank

3831
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:45,000
For lack of a better term out there for Chrono Trigger especially with the recent release

3832
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:50,000
I can see that but I'm a little disappointed that Final Fantasy 6 didn't pull through

3833
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:56,000
But I guess if it's going to be beat at least it didn't get beat by like DDR or something

3834
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,000
If Final Fantasy 6 is going to get beaten by a game at least it was Chrono Trigger

3835
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
At least I can say okay I understand that

3836
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Yeah and it's the same thing along Mario 3 beating DDR finally

3837
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:14,000
But also if you haven't heard and you are in the Pacific Northwest area

3838
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:18,000
The convention that I staff at Sakura Con is going to have Smile DK there

3839
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
It's their second North American appearance ever

3840
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:27,000
So it's in a month so I think preregistration closes next Sunday

3841
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:32,000
And I think it's $45 for all three days so if you want to go and meet Smile DK

3842
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:37,000
And also we're going to be doing under sedation live on location so

3843
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Is Travis going out there for that?

3844
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Travis is not but we have an internet connection and there's sure to be a lot of fun involved with that

3845
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:50,000
You know what if the Southwest prices stay low I might just have to consider it

3846
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Because my friend can get me a really good discount on rooms and stuff

3847
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,000
I might have to consider it press lol

3848
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Because especially if you can get us an interview with Smile DK I might really have to do it

3849
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Oh dude absolutely

3850
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Interesting I don't know I can't speak for the other two but I will always take an excuse to go to Seattle

3851
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Absolutely I took an excuse to move here

3852
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,000
I don't know but at the same time I've also been promising Chicago for years and years

3853
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:20,000
And I kind of feel like an obligation that if I'm going to do one I kind of need to make ASEN happen

3854
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
But we'll see

3855
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Alrighty well that's it really from here in Seattle so nice hearing from you guys again

3856
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Alright thank you as well Bresl and keep writing those articles for the website

3857
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Good time

3858
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
And by the way

3859
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,000
He hung up on us little bastard

3860
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:45,000
By the way speaking of articles on the website while we're waiting for another call

3861
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:49,000
At 1877 Game OLR username on Skype Orange Launch Radio

3862
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
I wanted to plug something on the website real quick

3863
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:54,000
It's an article that was just posted and I thought this was actually a pretty good idea

3864
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Something that was posted by Dekeman

3865
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Kind of a different contest here for the best Konami games

3866
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Because you know Konami's 40th birthday is coming up in a couple weeks

3867
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:06,000
We are going to actually do on OrangeLaunchRadio.com

3868
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,000
The top three favorite Konami games is what you post

3869
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:14,000
And then we're going to count down like the top five games in special highlight articles

3870
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
That's kind of fun

3871
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
So kind of counting down the top Konami games

3872
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Obviously we have a history with Konami here at this station

3873
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:25,000
So I fully expect that BeatMania 2DX will be the number one

3874
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
How can it not?

3875
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,000
With our audience I would be shocked and odd if BeatMania 2DX is not number one

3876
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
I'll tell you that wouldn't be my number one

3877
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
I don't know

3878
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I'd have to sit down and think long and hard

3879
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
I really have to look at like a big list of Konami games

3880
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I would put some obscure shit in there though

3881
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
I would tell you that

3882
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
You know what the top of my list would be Rob?

3883
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
What's that?

3884
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Dracula X

3885
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Oh that is Castlevania

3886
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Now it's tough

3887
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
You're on our website www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

3888
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Let's go back to the phones because it's been ringing

3889
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
And I'm sorry guys if I haven't been picking up

3890
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
But I wanted to get that out there

3891
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

3892
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Hey it's Ron what's up everyone?

3893
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Not much how you doing Rama?

3894
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Good I'm recovering from restoring windows on my computer

3895
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
But other than that life's been pretty good

3896
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Yeah

3897
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Good good

3898
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
What do we owe this phone call to tonight?

3899
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Some information that I happened to come across

3900
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I meant to discuss the last time I spoke to you guys

3901
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Now

3902
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
As you know Sega was at

3903
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Comic Con back in February

3904
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
It seems

3905
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
That another video game

3906
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Company is looking into going

3907
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
At the conventions as well

3908
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
How so?

3909
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Well as you guys know

3910
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
I work for a company where we go to cons

3911
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
We set up booths and we sell items

3912
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Now we're doing

3913
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Anime Boston in May

3914
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
And we just got information about

3915
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
A couple of weeks ago

3916
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
About two or three weeks ago

3917
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
About our location and where we're going to be

3918
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
It seems that our booth is going to be

3919
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
You ready for this?

3920
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Directly across from Nintendo

3921
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Huh

3922
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Interesting

3923
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Wow okay

3924
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
So Nintendo is going around the cons

3925
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
What do you think they're going to be showing off?

3926
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Do you think it's just the Wii or what?

3927
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
I really don't know

3928
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I'm thinking either

3929
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
It's going to be like a booth version of

3930
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Nintendo World set up there

3931
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Or um

3932
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Actually Nintendo will be coming down with kiosks

3933
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
With the displays that show off

3934
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
A lot of games

3935
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Hmm

3936
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Considering the business that you're in

3937
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
If it's what I think it is, if it's still the same

3938
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
I think that's very funny that you're going to be directly across from Nintendo actually

3939
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Well

3940
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Because they kind of screwed us

3941
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Over at one convention

3942
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
They gave us first dibs and when we picked it

3943
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
We found out afterwards that Nintendo is directly

3944
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Across from us so

3945
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Everyone at the booth will be doing Nintendo themed

3946
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Cosplays

3947
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Ha ha, I see, okay

3948
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Trying to get some attention, very smart

3949
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Well we try

3950
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Very smart

3951
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Well I expect a full report and pictures

3952
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Because sadly Anime Boston, I don't think

3953
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Considering I've got two other cons

3954
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I'm trying to weigh between, I don't think Anime Boston is going to happen

3955
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
However

3956
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
However, PAX East Coast

3957
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
You know I want to go to that

3958
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Well you best be there man

3959
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
That will be my arrival in Boston

3960
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
And I have internet friends in that area that I want to go visit anyway

3961
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
So it works out

3962
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
So we'll see

3963
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Well good luck with that

3964
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Any other conventions coming up that we ought to know about are our listeners

3965
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Well if you're in

3966
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
New York, New Jersey, Tri-State area

3967
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Coming up we have

3968
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Castle Point Anime Convention, Hoboken, New Jersey

3969
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
And ICON

3970
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
29 I believe

3971
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
One of East Coast's biggest

3972
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
sci-fi conventions

3973
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
It's sci-fi and medieval arts

3974
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Alright

3975
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Sci-fi and medieval arts

3976
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
It reminds me of that whole

3977
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Margaret Cho joke about

3978
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Why is it that, you know, Star Trek

3979
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Always seems to go hand in hand with the Ren Faire

3980
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
I don't know, sorry

3981
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Random thought

3982
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
I don't know about you but Star Trek can go with

3983
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Almost anything, you know

3984
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
It really can, it really can

3985
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
I'm gonna get some more calls but thank you so much

3986
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Alright, later

3987
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
There's a lot of you guys hammering the line tonight

3988
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I just don't want to try to get to as many calls as I can

3989
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3990
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
DS Master 26

3991
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Hi DS Master 26, what's on your mind?

3992
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Much more game review

3993
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
For ya, and uh

3994
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
A few comments and suggestions for the show

3995
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
Alrighty

3996
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Well, um

3997
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Cause I'm an F-Zero fan

3998
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
I mean, who isn't in this house, you know

3999
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Love F-Zero, wish they would

4000
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Put a new one out on the Wii already, yeah

4001
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
And just to fill the time

4002
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I'm waiting for a friggin' DS version

4003
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
To come out, I have a PSP here

4004
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
As you can tell, and so I'm like

4005
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
You know, it's a lot better to fill it than wipe out

4006
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Pure, right?

4007
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
So, I'm like

4008
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Okay

4009
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
I storied up everything, I have

4010
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
My friend Gamesafe who had all the classic

4011
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Packs and everything, cause I can't tell them

4012
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
For some weirdo reason, they closed the site

4013
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
To download stuff from

4014
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
But uh, it's a little bit more challenging

4015
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Than F-Zero, I'll tell you that

4016
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
It is, I've played the Wipeout

4017
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
On uh, Playstation Network, I can't remember the

4018
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Name of it, I think it's just Wipeout HD

4019
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
And uh, it's a little harder

4020
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Than F-Zero, it's such a different style

4021
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Too, F-Zero to me is a little more

4022
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Cartoony, but don't take that

4023
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Too literally, you know what I mean? Like

4024
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
F-Zero GX especially, which is one of my favorite

4025
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Racing games ever, is not definitely

4026
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
A cartoony looking game, but Wipeout feels a little

4027
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
More, I don't know, just a little more

4028
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
Edgy than F-Zero, but that doesn't

4029
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Usually that's a term that means

4030
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
One's better than the other, not in this case

4031
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Yeah, and uh

4032
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
I don't know, but like

4033
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
It's so hard to get on your

4034
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Channel sometimes, uh

4035
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Have you guys ever thought of like, you know, doing

4036
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Open mic or conference call

4037
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
With Skype?

4038
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Like AGI and DPL did?

4039
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
What do you mean like

4040
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Just opening it up so that every

4041
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Person can come on and chat and stuff?

4042
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Perhaps

4043
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
We like that, yeah

4044
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
I think the only problem with that is that, you know

4045
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
We try to cover a lot of ground during the show

4046
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
And I think if we did that, we would

4047
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Just, it would just kind of turn into this giant

4048
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
You know, cluster of a show

4049
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
What I would love, I would love to take calls

4050
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Throughout the show, but we need like

4051
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Somebody to screen the calls in order to be able

4052
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
To do that to make sure people are gonna stay on topic

4053
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Again, so the show can flow

4054
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
One of the feedback I hear about the show very often is that

4055
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
It's almost a little too long

4056
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
So I would just be afraid that if we did kind of just

4057
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
I mean, we got on enough tangents as it is

4058
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
If we let it get on even more tangents

4059
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
I'd just be afraid we'd be here for six hours

4060
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Which, you know, I do love this show

4061
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
But, um

4062
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
You know, I also love going to bed at a decent hour

4063
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
So, but you know

4064
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
That's why we do at least a Skype line, try to get the feedback

4065
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
And I know not everybody can always get through

4066
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
We try to do the emails and chat room comments

4067
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
And we'd like to think, out of all the gaming

4068
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Podcasts out there, we're one of the

4069
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
More interactive ones that are out there

4070
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
But I know there's other shows doing their thing

4071
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
But speaking of all games and all that stuff

4072
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
You know, look forward to

4073
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
At E3

4074
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
More of that kind of working together type of stuff

4075
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
That maybe you saw at Penny Arcade Expo

4076
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
I don't have anything down in writing for sure yet

4077
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
But you can definitely see that

4078
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
There will be some joining of the independent

4079
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Podcast to do some stuff

4080
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Come E3 this year, I would say that is

4081
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Inevitable, and working

4082
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
With the listeners for listener feedback

4083
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
I mean, I would love to do

4084
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Like live E3 shows

4085
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Where the listeners can call in and ask us questions

4086
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
And all that, but I don't know

4087
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
If without the E3

4088
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
What do they call that, E3 Arena this year

4089
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
I don't know if that's going to be as possible

4090
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
It's going to be interesting

4091
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
SSG100, Matt

4092
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Go ahead

4093
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
I also saw an episode of

4094
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Sessler's soapbox at Dollar Day

4095
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
And actually, strange enough

4096
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
I didn't get it from the

4097
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
E3, E4 TV side of my PSP

4098
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
Because, get this, they closed down

4099
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
The RSS feeds for PSP users

4100
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Which kind of sucks

4101
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
That's why I don't know if there's stuff on here before

4102
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
But yeah, so I had to

4103
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Go off iTunes and everything

4104
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
I had to convert, it's crud

4105
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
But the topic

4106
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
I'm sorry, I don't understand why

4107
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
You'd want to close out one of your

4108
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Why would you want to shut the door on your listeners?

4109
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
I mean, I guess when you're a TV station

4110
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
And you have that type of money, you can make those types of decisions

4111
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
But I just think it's crazy talk

4112
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
To close the door

4113
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
I mean, maybe it was costing them too much to produce

4114
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
But how much can it cost

4115
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
To translate a movie into PSP for

4116
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
It seems a little silly, a little silly

4117
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Yeah, and

4118
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Sessler's soapbox was going on

4119
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
About, you know, kids playing Emory games

4120
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
And how, you know, it's no different

4121
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Than some kid possibly

4122
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
You know, seeing a radar movie

4123
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
I mean, heck, when I was

4124
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Eleven, I saw The Matrix

4125
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
And I was, you know

4126
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Radar, did I end up

4127
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Going sniping people? No

4128
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Frickin' Chad Thompson

4129
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Who's

4130
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Well, thank God, disbarred

4131
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Um

4132
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Needs to get head screwed on straight

4133
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
I know, you know,

4134
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Unfortunately, these guys

4135
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Run with the one bad apple

4136
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
That ruins it for the rest of us normal people

4137
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
You know what I mean?

4138
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Yeah, because of that, I mean, the only

4139
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Way I was able to get my hands on

4140
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
GTA LCS

4141
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Was on Amazon with my debit card

4142
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Yes, I have one

4143
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
I used to have a job

4144
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
But now I'm dead broke with only

4145
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
One dollar twenty cents on my account

4146
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Don't have enough to pay taxes, I am so screwed

4147
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Oh no

4148
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Starting to get a little depressing

4149
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Alright, well

4150
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Is there anything else you wanted to comment on

4151
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Before we try to get some more calls?

4152
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Um, yeah

4153
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
You know, I kind of

4154
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Listened back to episode 3, 12 and what

4155
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Dan said, I went over to Game Shop

4156
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
And whatever

4157
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Like, sorry, we still can't give you a

4158
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Replacement or whatever

4159
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
And so

4160
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Basically, I don't know

4161
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
What else to go at here

4162
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Other than spend twenty bucks

4163
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
On a faceplate and whatever and replace

4164
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Next, I think that might be the issue

4165
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Yeah, it might be what you're gonna have to

4166
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Yeah, unfortunately it might be what you're gonna have to do at this

4167
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Point, I mean, I

4168
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
No, no, I remember

4169
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Yeah, I think this was

4170
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
The same one, but I remember the email a while back

4171
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
That Dan was responding to

4172
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
About the, yeah

4173
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
And it was kind of no guarantee

4174
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
That it was gonna work, so unfortunately

4175
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Yeah, you might just have to try and explore those

4176
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Options that are gonna cost a little bit of money

4177
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
I know you say you don't have no money right now

4178
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
But, you know, I guess there

4179
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Are some more things important than games

4180
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Prioritize

4181
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Yeah, because I spent

4182
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
A bunch of money on my

4183
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Prom date with my girlfriend who also

4184
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Plays Destroy All Humans and says

4185
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
That's better than GTA because she says

4186
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Flying saucers are better than

4187
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Pinks, but I don't know

4188
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
What's your view on that?

4189
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Prioritize

4190
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Since I've been a prom date

4191
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Before, I wouldn't have wanted a whole lot of money

4192
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Spent on me if it was at the expense

4193
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Of someone being able to pay their bills

4194
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
But, you know, it's all gonna be worth it

4195
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Because we're gonna be watching Twilight

4196
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Alright, well anyway, DS Master

4197
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
We gotta let you go, we gotta get some more calls

4198
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Before we end up, but thank you so much for your call

4199
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
And good luck with the monies

4200
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
I know it's a tight time for a lot of people right now

4201
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
But things will work out, they always do

4202
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Alright, good luck buddy

4203
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Peace out and keep rocking the show

4204
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Alright, we'll try, see ya

4205
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Alright, we'll probably take like one more call on the

4206
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Skypline of 1877 Game OLR

4207
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I wanted to read some comments

4208
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
That were in chat

4209
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
And now I can't find them, darn it

4210
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
It was a little while ago

4211
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
Oh, SSU100Matt says

4212
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
OLR was the first show to use Skype

4213
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
I still believe to this day that that is true

4214
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
That we were, but

4215
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Nobody probably believes me, anyway, we got one more call

4216
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
We'll take it, and then we're gonna wrap up the show

4217
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?

4218
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
It's Death Wishing

4219
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Hi, Death Wishing, what's on your mind?

4220
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
First, I'd like to say, no more cock jokes

4221
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Sure, you got a whole chat storm of cock jokes

4222
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
And it was very, um

4223
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Alright

4224
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
Unfortunately that happens sometimes

4225
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Is that one funny thing is said and the chat just won't let it die

4226
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
But that's just part of the

4227
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
It's a revival of the old big black cock

4228
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
It's, it's, it's not a big black cock

4229
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
It's charm?

4230
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
I don't know?

4231
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Oh, I forget, what did you call in about tonight?

4232
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Um, I would like to comment on the guitar hero

4233
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
You know, holy crap, there's a lot of them

4234
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
For real, right?

4235
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
I mean, did you hear earlier

4236
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
When we were saying, can you hear the milking of the franchise?

4237
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
I personally call it

4238
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
You know the weird 30 year old guy

4239
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
That stays in his mom's basement

4240
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
And has an addiction to porn

4241
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
It's pretty much, he's running out of Vaseline

4242
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
You better watch it, because I've got two of those three

4243
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
I'm 30 years old and addicted to porn

4244
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
But do you live with your mom?

4245
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
No, I don't, thankfully

4246
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Alright

4247
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Wait, so what about the guys that live with their mom?

4248
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
These are the guys that are gonna be buying the games?

4249
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
No, no, I'm just saying

4250
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
That's like an example

4251
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
That's an example of what they're doing to it

4252
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
My problem is that the guitar hero games

4253
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Aren't exactly the same as like Rock Band

4254
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
Whereas Rock Band, say for example

4255
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
You know, someone was actually

4256
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Doing a comparison with the amount of games

4257
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
That Rock Band releases, and to be honest

4258
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
The games that they release, like the track packs

4259
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Or whatever, it's just download content

4260
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
That's available now on disc

4261
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
It's not something that you necessarily need to buy

4262
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
It's nothing new, unless you don't have internet

4263
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:30,000
But the guitar hero games

4264
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:33,000
They're all these different new tracks

4265
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
That you can't dump together

4266
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
So you have to buy all these games

4267
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
And each one has to be played separately

4268
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
And that's retarded

4269
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
And that's one thing I really like about Rock Band 2 as well

4270
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Is that it seems like the developers of Rock Band

4271
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Are continuing to add to Rock Band 2

4272
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Granted, yeah, you got the ACDC game

4273
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
But they didn't really bother to promote that that much

4274
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
It was just kind of a one-off thing

4275
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Like, hey, this is out there, you can get this

4276
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:58,000
And then everything is pouring into Rock Band 2

4277
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
They have all this regular content

4278
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:03,000
And sure, okay, the Beatles game is going to be

4279
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
A completely separate game

4280
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
But it's the fucking Beatles, they're allowed

4281
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Well, that's the deal that they had

4282
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
They would have done it as a Rock Band track pack

4283
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
But the people that have the Beatles license

4284
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
They're like, uh, no

4285
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Which, again, it's the Beatles, they're allowed

4286
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
There's not a lot of bands I'd say that for

4287
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
But with Guitar Hero, yeah, I mean, come on

4288
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
The greatest hits

4289
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
The sub-par 80s game

4290
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Pretty much, if you want greatest hits

4291
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
Just pick up the

4292
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Dish, you'll probably be able to get it cheaper

4293
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Well, even the greatest hits isn't so bad

4294
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Because they're expanding on it

4295
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
And that's fine, but

4296
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
I don't know, it's just

4297
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
It's all these games

4298
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
And all these artist-specific games

4299
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
To me, it sounds very risky

4300
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Because not everyone loves Metallica

4301
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Not everyone loves Van Halen

4302
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Not everyone loves Aerosmith

4303
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
I mean, so

4304
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
And the other thing, too, they're all

4305
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Well, you know, you get like 40-some tracks

4306
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
For, you know, 60 bucks or whatever

4307
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
That's a great deal

4308
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
I might not want all those tracks

4309
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
At least with Rock Band, I can pick and choose what I want

4310
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
And that's why I love Rock Band

4311
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
You know, yeah, from a gamer standpoint

4312
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Right now, I, you know

4313
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Somebody who's been playing music

4314
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Games for about 10 years now

4315
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
I definitely prefer Rock Band to Guitar Hero

4316
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
At this point in time

4317
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
For these reasons that we've been stating

4318
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
It's just

4319
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
A better package to me

4320
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
And plus, also, consider this

4321
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
The Guitar Hero on tour, the DS one

4322
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Eh, you know, what are they trying to do with that?

4323
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
DS one gives you carpal tunnel

4324
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Yeah, they're trying to condense

4325
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
The guitar playing experience into the DS

4326
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Which just doesn't really work

4327
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
And honestly, those DS games, they're about

4328
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
As different with each other as, unfortunately

4329
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
The guitar-free schemes in their arcades

4330
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Trackless update, trackless update

4331
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Let's reskin it a little bit, done

4332
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
But, the Rock Band game that's coming out

4333
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
For PSP, where they're kind of

4334
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
Now taking this different approach to it

4335
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Where it's gonna be more like frequency or amplitude

4336
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
If the rumors are to be believed

4337
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
That sounds awesome!

4338
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
No stupid peripheral to plug in my PSP

4339
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Just making music

4340
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
And in a way

4341
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
That's just different from

4342
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
It sounds great

4343
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Dang moment

4344
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Here's a thought, this would be kind of cool

4345
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Can you imagine if they were to do

4346
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
A game like that, for say the 360

4347
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Or whatever, and the PS3

4348
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Kind of like this amplitude Rock Band thing

4349
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
But, it took all the music that you

4350
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Downloaded from Rock Band and allowed you to

4351
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
Use that

4352
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Jizz in my pants

4353
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Isn't that pretty much audio surf?

4354
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
It basically is, sort of

4355
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
Audio surf is more of just a game that's a rhythm

4356
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
Stuff, it doesn't add elements

4357
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
To the music, you don't

4358
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Play the drum track and play something else

4359
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Yeah, audio surf also

4360
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Can kind of be a little hit and miss

4361
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
If you play a song with a very strong beat

4362
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
It'll be a lot better than just

4363
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
It's just like those

4364
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
DDR games, what was like the Codemasters

4365
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Game where you could play any CD

4366
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Dance Factory or whatever

4367
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
A lot of songs in Dance Factory

4368
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I've not really heard of that

4369
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
We know a lot of obscure shit here, but there was a

4370
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
DDR knock off where you could put in your own CD

4371
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
And get the arrows generated

4372
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
And it was very hit and miss, mostly miss

4373
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Dude

4374
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Alright, well hey, any other

4375
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Final thoughts before we get on out of here?

4376
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
I went to UCLA

4377
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
And they have two street fighter cabinets

4378
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Four cabinets there

4379
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
At UCLA, really?

4380
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Big scene there? Were they busy?

4381
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Well, I went there when it was lunch

4382
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Because I'm not that old, I'm only 16

4383
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
I went on a field trip there

4384
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
And there was like

4385
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
It was lunch time, there was about

4386
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Maybe 10 people

4387
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
In there, I guess at lunch, you know, some people

4388
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Could be in classes or something, but they also had

4389
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
King of Fighters and Street Fighter 3

4390
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
You know, and it was just like

4391
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
They all

4392
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
It was pretty much like the

4393
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
All the Asian games you want to play

4394
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
Since you're in the LA area, have you ever been to an arcade out there

4395
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Called Arcade Infinity?

4396
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
No. It's out in City of

4397
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Industry, and actually we've

4398
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Back in the day when we were much more into the DDR

4399
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
And Beatmania, we would drive all the way from Sacramento

4400
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Where we're based, to go to this arcade

4401
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
To play some of the legendary games

4402
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
There was the Gundam game

4403
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
That was epic

4404
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
There were just so many epic games

4405
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
I haven't been there in a long time, but I imagine they've got

4406
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Quite a crowd of people, too, around these fighting games

4407
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
So, you know, there's definitely an audience

4408
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
For it, and it's

4409
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
The only arcades I ever really went to were like

4410
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
I think the Sega one I knew

4411
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Oh, Gameworks?

4412
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
No, it was all Sega

4413
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But then it got turned into Gameworks, I think

4414
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Oh, because I knew that Gameworks was a Sega arcade

4415
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
I think I know what he's talking about

4416
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
I can't remember

4417
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
I might have been there once, but anyway

4418
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
It had this awesome helicopter game where you rolled around

4419
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
The Sega 360

4420
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
Was that the Tatsu?

4421
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Was that a Sega thing?

4422
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
That's the Sega 360

4423
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
It's a lot better than the Tatsu thing

4424
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Oh, okay. A little different

4425
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
But arcades are pretty much dead now

4426
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
And it's sad, because

4427
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
All the online gaming

4428
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Has really put a dent in it

4429
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
It's gonna take something epic to bring people back

4430
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
But who knows? Maybe when the recession

4431
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
I know a way to bring back arcades

4432
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Real quick, what is it?

4433
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
Boobs

4434
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
We'll see what happens

4435
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
Alright, Deathwishing, we gotta let you go to wrap up this show

4436
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
Good luck on your quest for boobs in arcades

4437
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Alright

4438
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
I'll be a millionaire one day, just watch

4439
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Alright, you heard it here first

4440
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Alright, take care, buddy

4441
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
Bye

4442
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
I think everybody's thought about trying that

4443
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Like mixing a strip club with an arcade

4444
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
With, I don't know, maybe there's local laws

4445
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
I approve

4446
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
No, I mean

4447
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
That's just a strip club with an arcade in it

4448
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
The problem is, though, is you really want

4449
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
I mean, they don't want

4450
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Arcade games in a strip club

4451
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Because one, you have to pay money to get into a strip club

4452
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
And two, it takes away from the time

4453
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
That the strippers have with you, so they can't get paid

4454
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
What if you got a lap dance

4455
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
While playing, you know, Street Fighter IV

4456
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
That'd be distracting

4457
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Yeah, it would be a little distracting

4458
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
I tried

4459
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
Alright, we're gonna take a minute to wrap up the show here

4460
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
But a strip club with video game themes

4461
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
That could be dual

4462
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Or video games and anime themes

4463
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
That could be dual

4464
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Alright

4465
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
That sounds like a bad convention

4466
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
Like a cosplay strip club

4467
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
But not with nasty looking chicks

4468
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
It's not like when Consumer Electronics Show is going on

4469
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
At the same time as the adult video convention

4470
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
That kind of thing

4471
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Remember they just need to combine them into one

4472
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Alright, we gotta wrap up the show

4473
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Enough silly talk, we need to wrap up the show

4474
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
We're running a little long tonight, which is fine

4475
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
We've had a good show, a lot of good discussion tonight

4476
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
And yeah, it was a good show, good calls, good discussion

4477
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Good chat, I'm feeling good about tonight's show

4478
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
So thank you all for making it a success

4479
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Let's get some, I don't think there's any more

4480
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
Last minute stories, right Loki?

4481
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Yeah, there's some Guitar Hero stuff

4482
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Coming out this month, including Queen

4483
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
No, well, download tracks

4484
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Including Queen

4485
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Oh, well, that is epic

4486
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
I will promise a story for Queen

4487
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Yeah, so there's some interesting songs

4488
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Including, I'm trying to think what they were now

4489
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
As I pull this up

4490
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
I think Killer Queen was one of them

4491
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Which is interesting

4492
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
And then

4493
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Let's see here

4494
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
It was nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody

4495
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Or anything cool like that, unfortunately

4496
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Um

4497
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
Sorry

4498
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Let me just pull this up here

4499
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Killer Queen

4500
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
That's interesting, because there was a cover

4501
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Of that in Guitar Freaks back in the day

4502
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Maybe that was the only

4503
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Um

4504
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Maybe that was the only Queen song

4505
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
From the download content

4506
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
I think there was only one or two, wasn't Bicycle in it?

4507
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
I don't remember, Fat Bottom Girls or something

4508
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
I don't know, they need them all

4509
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
This is interesting, because Queen's

4510
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
Supposed to be in SingStar too

4511
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
They had

4512
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Yeah, Killer Queen

4513
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
Which is going to be part of

4514
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
The Queen Track Pack

4515
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
We Are the Champions

4516
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Actually, no, Killer Queen isn't in that

4517
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
It's We Are the Champions, Fat Bottom Girls

4518
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
And Celebrity

4519
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
And those are all going to be available in the Queen Track Pack

4520
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
On March 26th

4521
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
The week before that, they're going to have the Jimi Hendrix

4522
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Track Pack with Freedom, Angel, and

4523
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Foxy Lady, the live version

4524
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Nice, on March 19th

4525
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Also available on March 19th would be the European

4526
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Track Pack

4527
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
I'm not sure if these were available in Europe

4528
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
I'm sure it might be just European bands

4529
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
With What Have You Done

4530
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
By Within Temptation

4531
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
I Are Comet Alex

4532
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
By Dai Toten Hosen

4533
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
And Carolina

4534
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
By MClan

4535
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
And then finally, available last week

4536
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000

4537
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
In the Shadows by

4538
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Rasmus

4539
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
And Cies Komesa

4540
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
By Lesrita

4541
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Mitsuko

4542
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
I don't know, I think I butchered that last name

4543
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Mitsuko

4544
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Yeah

4545
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
Alright

4546
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Ok, we gotta wrap up, we're gonna get all the closing

4547
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
thoughts and wrap on out of here for tonight

4548
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
We are running a little long tonight

4549
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Show's very, very long, but that's alright, it was a good show

4550
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
Dark Sakura, your final thought for us tonight

4551
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Happy birthday, Chris

4552
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
I agree, happy birthday, Chris

4553
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
How dare I not say anything, I left her message on Facebook

4554
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
earlier, but you know, just got sidetracked with the show

4555
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
Yes, happy birthday

4556
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Chris, one of the OLR lesbians

4557
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
My final thought

4558
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
would be, I

4559
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
am craving

4560
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
Pringles

4561
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
And no, this isn't a G4 show

4562
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
back in the day, we're all sponsored by Pringles

4563
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
but I really am craving Pringles, Loki, your final thought

4564
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
I am not craving

4565
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Pringles, Pringles are nasty

4566
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Pringles are not nasty, you're nasty

4567
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Alright, we're done, we're out of here

4568
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000

02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because we do

4578
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
rely on word of mouth to get the word out there

4579
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
