1
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:18,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, March 8th, 2009, are Xbox elites on their way out?

2
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:23,722
[SPEAKER_01]: New King of Fighters 12 details are revealed, and are our boy and his blob set to make a comeback?

3
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:31,907
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

4
00:00:59,162 --> 00:00:59,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

5
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:00,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting?

6
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:01,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

7
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:03,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting good or interesting bad?

8
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:06,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Because interesting is a very interesting term.

9
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:07,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting neutral.

10
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fair enough.

11
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:12,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Suddenly I feel like we're talking about D&D alignments or something.

12
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:13,855
[SPEAKER_05]: You're chaotic interesting.

13
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:14,536
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny.

14
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:19,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I took a D&D alignment test and I'd taken the same one before and it came out chaotic good before.

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,222
[SPEAKER_08]: This last time I came out true neutral.

16
00:01:21,902 --> 00:01:23,143
[SPEAKER_05]: But feelings change.

17
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,965
[SPEAKER_05]: How long ago was it that you took the test?

18
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:26,793
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

19
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:55,668
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Techmaster Loki?

20
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:56,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

21
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:56,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

22
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:57,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

23
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:57,970
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a good week?

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was a pretty good week.

25
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand you finally got to Airsoft today.

26
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:03,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, finally.

27
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:03,614
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that?

28
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:04,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

29
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, we played like three games.

30
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:14,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We played at a different place than normal because I didn't want to drive an hour to where we normally play.

31
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:17,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So we played at a field next to my work.

32
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:20,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was pretty nice.

33
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:22,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's lots of rocks because...

34
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,190
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

35
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:54,898
[SPEAKER_04]: There's cobblestone hills that we were on top of and there's a bunch of eucalyptus trees that they planted there for some reason so it's like a big jungle out there.

36
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,680
[SPEAKER_04]: First person shooters for real, right?

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to try out one of my new guns and it's so awesome.

39
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,544
[SPEAKER_04]: My other guns, my older ones, not so awesome.

40
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:25,651
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course there's always you guys who join us here every week on Orange Lounge Radio when we tape live and you can join us in our chat room live chat.orangeloungeradio.com or we're on the Game Surge Network for you IRC fans at channel Orange Lounge and the first comment tonight from Shadowrunner Xbox is awesome until the red ring of death and then it's fail

41
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

42
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,031
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the Xbox has taken a lot of crap for the Red Ring.

43
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:36,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure, Microsoft's, you know, kind of done the whole, you know, oops, our bad, we're going to extend the warranties and all that on that.

44
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:45,883
[SPEAKER_05]: But it makes me think of an article, if I can work in a cheap plug here, for the neworangeontradio.com website, which has actually been, you know, thanks to our new writing staff, has had a pretty constant stream of new articles.

45
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:46,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I say, it's pretty awesome.

46
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:53,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them was written by Breslow earlier this week, and he was kind of talking about, is it just me, or are these new console systems...

47
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Just not built to last, like the old ones.

48
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:02,316
[SPEAKER_05]: He was kind of saying, I could probably still find a Nintendo that works, or a Super Nintendo that works.

49
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:09,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And come to think of it, I was kind of reading the article and thinking, yeah, I don't think I ever, ever had a console break until the Xbox 360.

50
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:27,395
[SPEAKER_05]: but then there's also another argument that says well look consoles broke all the time you just didn't hear about it because now the internet culture you know one person's console breaks in a you know over the top way and it hits every game blog on the internet and you know millions of people read about it kind of different interesting schools of thought

51
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:29,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

52
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:37,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Old school 8-bit NESs might still work, but you still have to blow on the cartridge and blow in the system to get it to work.

53
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:40,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're lucky enough to have a top loader.

54
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,100
[SPEAKER_04]: With the 360, it's basically praying that it's not going to break.

55
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if you look at it funny, it's like, I'm going to die now.

56
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:53,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're happy.

57
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:58,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, you just kind of hope that it's going to last the full three years or whatever.

58
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:01,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just like the 360 that I fixed that's modded.

59
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just surprised each day that it works.

60
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:09,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's like, there's no reason that this should work, but it is.

61
00:05:09,752 --> 00:05:10,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day is a new gift.

62
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:11,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.

63
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:16,984
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 in chat says, hey, some of my Super Nintendo games don't work anymore.

64
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:18,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I'm curious about.

65
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:23,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Those batteries, remember how batteries were only supposed to last like five years?

66
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,927
[SPEAKER_05]: The batteries that they have in the Zelda games or the battery backup?

67
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:30,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody ever read the fine print that those things were only supposed to last five years?

68
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:32,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Do some of those still work?

69
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:33,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of those batteries really failing.

70
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:34,949
[SPEAKER_08]: My Zelda cartridge finally died.

71
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:35,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it really?

72
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:35,949
[SPEAKER_05]: It did.

73
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the same lithium batteries are used in the Sega Saturn.

74
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:43,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine have had to be replaced a couple times.

75
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:45,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

76
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:52,358
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf, plugging his other show in chat, we learned on Friday Night Gaming that blowing on the cartridge actually does nothing.

77
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:55,560
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the readjusting into the cartridge slot that fixed it.

78
00:05:55,881 --> 00:06:01,304
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I always thought it was the moisture that you, when you were blowing on the cartridge, it was the moisture from your breath was helping with the contacts.

79
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:03,946
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I always thought was the... Oh, interesting.

80
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:05,767
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to just take alcohol swabs.

81
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:07,509
[SPEAKER_04]: It all depends on how...

82
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:11,249
[SPEAKER_04]: What condition are your consoles in, you know, in your games?

83
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:17,693
[SPEAKER_04]: If you leave your games out and they're super dusty, then blowing in it, I can imagine, would, you know, fix that a little bit.

84
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:30,201
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, usually it's the contacts on the inside that are really dirty, and thankfully they did have the NES cleaning kit, and you could, you know, do that, and then you see the contacts, and they come out all black, and you're like, wow.

85
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:33,123
[SPEAKER_05]: One more comment from chat, and then we'll get to how was your gaming week.

86
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:38,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Say in chat says, I've only ever had my PS1 break caught on fire.

87
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't... I would freak the hell out if that ever happened with a gaming system.

88
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:45,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine a gaming system catching fire?

89
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, what did you do with that system?

90
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it like a 48-hour Final Fantasy VII marathon or something?

91
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:51,218
[SPEAKER_05]: How did your system catch fire?

92
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:53,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe it wasn't properly vented.

93
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

94
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:59,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those systems... Or he poured gasoline on it and set it on fire.

95
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:03,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that would be a whoops mistake.

96
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:03,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

97
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:04,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's...

98
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:09,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Breaking these consoles in all these intricate ways makes me think back.

99
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:13,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys remember the SmashMyWii.com or whatever it was?

100
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:15,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be mistaken.

101
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:19,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Where they stood in line all night long to buy a Wii only so they could break it.

102
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they do that all the time.

103
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: The novelty is worn off.

104
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,190
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

105
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:53,042
[SPEAKER_05]: and Sage just followed up in chat.

106
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:54,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It was some 24-hour thing.

107
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:55,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

108
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:58,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to how was your gaming week.

109
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,945
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

110
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:02,125
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of games did you play this week?

111
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:04,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Played Ragnarok Online and that's about it.

112
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting back into the Ragnarok, huh?

113
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:10,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan found all of our Guilty Gear figures today and a few Mega Drive cartridges and stuff.

114
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:38,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

115
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I found a copy of Policenauts.

116
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:41,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

117
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:42,915
[SPEAKER_05]: That's random.

118
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I got a question.

119
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't asked this in a while.

120
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened with Ragnarok 2?

121
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:48,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard anything on that in a while.

122
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:49,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Did that ever release?

123
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:50,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

124
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:51,899
[SPEAKER_05]: You weren't a fan?

125
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:52,679
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still in beta.

126
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

127
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,700
[SPEAKER_05]: After all this time?

128
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,221
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been in beta for like two years.

129
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:58,482
[SPEAKER_08]: How long was the first Ragnarok in beta?

130
00:08:59,463 --> 00:08:59,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

131
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:01,744
[SPEAKER_08]: You played with me in the beta.

132
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:02,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember, yeah.

133
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:03,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a long time ago.

134
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:04,165
[SPEAKER_08]: With your mage with a bow.

135
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:04,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

136
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:10,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Deathwishing in chat says Ragnarok is way too confusing

137
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,691
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

138
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:38,207
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also a different kind of game, right?

139
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:42,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you go to this game after playing something like, I don't know, Warcraft, it's different.

140
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:43,069
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easier.

141
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragnarok Online is infinitely easier than World of Warcraft.

142
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:57,892
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing that I think that people don't like about it is that you don't have someone holding your hand and allocating your points for you.

143
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:03,574
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not, you know, maybe it's because they expect you to fucking use your brain to allocate your points.

144
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:04,834
[SPEAKER_08]: You know.

145
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,720
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

146
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I right or am I right?

147
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:11,104
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been so long since I've played.

148
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:12,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly can't tell you.

149
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember how the damn game works.

150
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:15,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the porings were really cute.

151
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:16,027
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I remember.

152
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:16,908
[SPEAKER_08]: World of Warcraft.

153
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't want to say it necessarily handholds you in how to distribute your point, but here's the thing.

154
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:34,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Warcraft is so infinitely popular, you can go onto websites upon websites to tell you how to build your character, and then you get these elitist raiders that if you don't shape your character a certain way, then you are suck.

155
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:37,443
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the end, it's all basically your armor.

156
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:40,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the stuff you've got on you that controls it.

157
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:48,329
[SPEAKER_08]: In Ragnarok, if you kill creature, creature, creature, you can go put all of it in your intelligence and have a mage.

158
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:49,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Intelligence and dex.

159
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:57,434
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want, say if you're playing an assassin, you put it all in your agility, a little bit in strength, and a lot of it in dex, and boom!

160
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,536
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hit and hit a lot.

161
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:01,457
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know...

162
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:08,921
[SPEAKER_08]: And on top of that, your armor and your accessories are all in addition to what you do.

163
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not really that confusing.

164
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:13,504
[SPEAKER_08]: You just have to know what you want.

165
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:19,348
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf in chat, If I wanted to use my brain, I wouldn't rot them away playing a video game.

166
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,489
[SPEAKER_05]: He says with a little hint of sarcasm.

167
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

168
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:26,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Lost and Damned.

169
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

170
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Just multiplayer.

171
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:32,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get around to doing much of anything.

172
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:36,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to figure out why that was.

173
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:38,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I remember now.

174
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:44,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was trying to hack the Lost and Damned, and it's fucking hard.

175
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:48,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

176
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:50,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So no luck there.

177
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:51,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Because apparently they have...

178
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,341
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

179
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,713
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so complicated that it just fries my brain thinking about it.

180
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:20,317
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to do it because you can edit it just like the PC because it has the same format and stuff, so that'll be fun.

181
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:23,739
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's pretty much that.

182
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I did find my...

183
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:35,448
[SPEAKER_04]: DS Lite I'm getting from work Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Killzone 2 Not that I'm really excited about it because I don't give a shit about Resident Evil but I'll play it anyways, whatever

184
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Killzone 2 looks interesting.

185
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:58,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't going to buy it, though, so thank God I don't have to pay for it.

186
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:02,651
[SPEAKER_04]: But Mad World, holy shit, I can't wait to play that game.

187
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be one I'll be playing next week.

188
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:06,597
[SPEAKER_04]: But lots of fun stuff coming up.

189
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:11,534
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week, I didn't have time to play a whole lot.

190
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:14,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I did check out Quake Live for a brief little bit.

191
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:17,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that the queues apparently aren't such an issue.

192
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:21,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, the first couple days you try to get in there, you had these queues that were like thousands of people long.

193
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:22,479
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, yeah, right, you're not going to get in there.

194
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: But finally I snuck in there one night and got to play because I think they finally eliminated the queues or really opened up the servers or something or the fever just died down.

195
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:31,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really easy to get in there now.

196
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:32,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did play for a little bit.

197
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:33,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't...

198
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:40,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I was surprised because I don't know why, but I was under the impression that Quake Live was a new version of the original Quake.

199
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:40,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

200
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:41,708
[SPEAKER_05]: It's based off Quake 3.

201
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Even, like, the same voice, you know, and all that stuff.

202
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was, you know, kind of pleasantly surprised.

203
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:50,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how it does that skill match in the beginning.

204
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:54,214
[SPEAKER_05]: In the very beginning, when you sign on to Quake Live, you have to play a 10-minute match against a computer opponent.

205
00:13:54,515 --> 00:14:00,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets a little harder as you, you know, start kicking her butt, and then, you know, it gets a little easier if she starts killing you a lot.

206
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:02,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's supposed to skill match you with other opponents.

207
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:02,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know...

208
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:03,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

209
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:28,925
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

210
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:59,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a good time with Quake Live, the little time I spent with it.

211
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:00,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go back and revisit it.

212
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I also played some Rock Band, too, because I love me some Rock Band.

213
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:05,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Spent an obscene amount of money on new songs.

214
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:06,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I waste my money like that, but I do.

215
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:10,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, I have to play No Doubt and New, and I really want to play White Zombie.

216
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:13,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two drum sets, and I use neither of them.

217
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

218
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I should borrow one.

219
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get my drum achievements.

220
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:16,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

221
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got one.

222
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the wireless one with the cymbals.

223
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:21,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the cymbals for it.

224
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:22,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

225
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:22,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

226
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:28,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and they're kind of... And I have a drum bag to carry the drums.

227
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking about getting that little portable one.

228
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:31,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how well they work.

229
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:32,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get that.

230
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:33,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it terrible?

231
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:34,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like crap.

232
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know, but it looks... You know, I like the idea that it doesn't take up all this freaking space in my house.

233
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,135
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you kind of just put it out on the table and play.

234
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:43,076
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

235
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:05,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the other thing.

236
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:13,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Also in my gaming week, I downloaded the demo for The Last Remnant, but I haven't checked it out yet, so I don't know why I mentioned it, but I'm going to check that out this next week because I'm curious.

237
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:17,744
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's really, really good, I might just get it on 360, but I'm also kind of curious how it's going to run on PC.

238
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:29,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also, I wanted to go back and play Civilization IV because, you know, after video games live and everything and seeing little slideshows, I was like, oh, I need to get back into Civilization and play this game again.

239
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So I remembered it was on GameTap.

240
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:31,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

241
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm locked into their current ones, so I'm not going to get shifted or whatever.

242
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if I really like the direction game tab setting.

243
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:56,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be honest.

244
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,940
[SPEAKER_05]: As a fair critic, I don't know if I necessarily like.

245
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't really judge until it happens.

246
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,981
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they have this whole thing where the arcade games are going to actually be playable in the browser window.

247
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:11,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the classic games, and now some of the other stuff.

248
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:17,263
[SPEAKER_05]: They're kind of turning into this hybrid of Steam and what sounds to me like Pogo games.

249
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to pay for Pogo games.

250
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:19,984
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

251
00:17:20,424 --> 00:17:20,884
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

252
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:25,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to withhold my full judgment until it comes out.

253
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:25,967
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

254
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:28,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not happy either that some of these things just won't work in Vista.

255
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand the games are old.

256
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,510
[SPEAKER_05]: They were made for a certain Windows system.

257
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,471
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my fault for being stupid and having Vista.

258
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:36,952
[SPEAKER_05]: But look, that's what my computer came with.

259
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:37,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all I have.

260
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:40,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep seeing advertisements for good old gaming.

261
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's a website.

262
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Steam or something.

263
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:44,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

264
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:45,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

265
00:18:02,218 --> 00:18:03,959
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in chat says, I agree.

266
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:07,400
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't used it in a long time, especially since they're all about PC ports nowadays.

267
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know, call me stupid if you want.

268
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

269
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I made an impulse buy a few months ago.

270
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:12,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that you've ever made impulse buys, Loki.

271
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:14,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought a full year of GameTap up front.

272
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm locked into this thing for a year, whether I like it or not.

273
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So at least, you know, I'll have a chance to give it a full review, and maybe it'll win me over.

274
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't like what I'm hearing.

275
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:23,525
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

276
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:28,489
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I kind of look at these changes and I go, oh boy, alright, I'm going to have to see this in motion.

277
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:30,910
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I guess in the end it is all about the games.

278
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:35,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they can make it so that Civ 4 will magically work in Windows Vista, I don't know what they have to do.

279
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:38,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine if they emulate all these old games, there's got to be a way to do it.

280
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:40,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Civ 4 is not like an obscure game.

281
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't you run it, like, say in the compatibility mode with XP or something like that?

282
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Run GameTap?

283
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:47,824
[SPEAKER_04]: How about compatibility mode?

284
00:18:58,857 --> 00:18:59,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said that.

285
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:00,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

286
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:02,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I finally got to use Vista.

287
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:11,702
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife's co-worker wanted me to find her some stuff to put onto her system.

288
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:13,643
[SPEAKER_04]: All legit software, of course.

289
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:16,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hate Vista.

290
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:19,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks really bad.

291
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:23,527
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the hand-holding stuff really pisses me off.

292
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:24,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I disagree.

293
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:26,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

294
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm iffy on it.

295
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:31,347
[SPEAKER_05]: These compatibility type issues make me a little irked with Vista.

296
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:33,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm more looking forward to the new Windows than I am.

297
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:35,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of like, Vista's a stepping stone for me.

298
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:37,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like Vista now.

299
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:41,271
[SPEAKER_08]: My system is completely tailored around running it.

300
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:43,732
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just how it was when I bought it.

301
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:46,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So it runs like a dream on my computer.

302
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:47,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's fast.

303
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, on my computer it's well optimized and everything, but it's just, I don't know.

304
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:55,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I disabled all the touchscreen stuff because it was fucking with my tablet.

305
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:01,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And I disabled a few things here and there, but then again, I've always tweaked XP to get it to run how I want it to.

306
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:05,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I tweak every OS I get my hands on to make it run the way I want it to.

307
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:06,397
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?

308
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, my Vista runs like XP with a few goodies.

309
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:14,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you wouldn't be able to play Civ 4 either.

310
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I probably would be able to.

311
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:19,361
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can get it to work, let me know.

312
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:25,463
[SPEAKER_08]: City of Heroes gave me compatibility issues and I just changed it to run in compatibility mode and boom, no problem.

313
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:26,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check it out.

314
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it is something that simple and I'm just being stupid.

315
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:30,265
[SPEAKER_08]: All it did was change my resolution.

316
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:31,665
[SPEAKER_05]: That's certainly a possibility.

317
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:33,026
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it changes it back when it's done.

318
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:34,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll see.

319
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:35,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try it, I'll try it.

320
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:40,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to dig into compatibility mode, so, and then I'll get all those emails this week, you idiot, it was super easy.

321
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:45,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Then GameTap will email me, you idiot, stop talking negative about our service and you can't figure it out.

322
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:53,472
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I would think, if GameTap's going to give me an error message about not being able to start the game, it should tell me, hey, you should think about running in compatibility mode.

323
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:56,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it could have been right in front of my face and I was just too pissed off not to see it.

324
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:56,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

325
00:20:57,415 --> 00:21:03,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into... Yeah, an ex-Link in chat says, I have Civ 4 and I run it off Vista.

326
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,000
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

327
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm doing something wrong, we'll see.

328
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:09,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can fully admit, look, I'm not the biggest computer genius in the world.

329
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:13,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just get you Civ 4, you know, so that you could play it without GameTap.

330
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's what I'll be forced to do.

331
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:18,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I will feel that sense of entitlement.

332
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:19,192
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right!

333
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,154
[SPEAKER_05]: GameTap forced you!

334
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:24,236
[SPEAKER_05]: They forced you into this, okay?

335
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:24,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

336
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:27,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with the show.

337
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:30,971
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some housekeeping to get into, and then we're going to get into tonight's show.

338
00:21:31,352 --> 00:21:40,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com right now, live tonight during the show, Orange Lounge Radio March Madness, the Elite Eight is wrapping up right now.

339
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:42,279
[SPEAKER_05]: And check that out.

340
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:43,279
[SPEAKER_05]: You can vote.

341
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,442
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some pretty epic matchups going on in the top eight right now.

342
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:49,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy VI versus Chrono Trigger.

343
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:53,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Before the show tonight, Chrono Trigger was leading, but a lot can change.

344
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:54,307
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty epic matchup.

345
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:59,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can go vote in that and the final four will be announced a little later tonight after the show.

346
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:03,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And keep an eye on OrangeLaunchRadio.com for that throughout the week.

347
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:10,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we have some more people writing on OrangeLaunchRadio.com and now we have some new segments that showed up out of the blue that I'm loving.

348
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I heart that song.

349
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:16,911
[SPEAKER_05]: They've actually kind of been, I guess, using the classic game of the week a little bit as an inspiration.

350
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:22,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our staff writers have been writing these tributes to great songs in gaming, which has been kind of cool.

351
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:24,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, just some

352
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:28,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Other great segments on OrangeLaunchRadio.com Very happy with the direction the new site's going.

353
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:31,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I guess that's it for housekeeping.

354
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:35,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget LiveJournal, Facebook, MySpace, all that good stuff.

355
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki.

356
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,683
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

357
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live Arcade Game Night

358
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:29,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I remember correctly, I think Hasbro Family Game Night is actually like five different games.

359
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.

360
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:32,909
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Sorry and a bunch of the old classic games.

361
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,770
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if on the 18th they're going to get like five games all of a sudden, but whatever.

362
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:45,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming out will be The Dishwasher Dead Samurai, which if you remember was that really kick-ass XNA game.

363
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally now an actual game.

364
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:51,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Flock, Outrun Online Arcade, Puzzle Quest Galactrix, Uno Rush, and Lode Runner.

365
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:12,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Those all sound pretty awesome, actually.

366
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:13,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, though.

367
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:20,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get the same thrill out of Hasbro Family Game Night that I did out of Geometry Wars 2 and some of the things that came out this summer.

368
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:29,276
[SPEAKER_05]: But I understand Xbox has a family-friendly niche they need to fill pretty badly to compete with Nintendo, so I'm okay with it.

369
00:24:29,316 --> 00:24:30,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand why they need stuff like that.

370
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:31,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It all depends what games.

371
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:35,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what they had in the Hasbro Family Game Night if they actually had...

372
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:38,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Battleship might be fun

373
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:02,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that.

374
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I could see it too.

375
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,700
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of love being lavished upon Galaga Legions in our chatroom.

376
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,021
[SPEAKER_05]: SonofDad says Galaga Legions was the best last year.

377
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:12,901
[SPEAKER_05]: SonicM88, I loved Galaga Legions.

378
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:14,502
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a pretty good release in the last batch too.

379
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:17,222
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't actually... I think I downloaded that.

380
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:18,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if I bought it or not.

381
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded it and played the demo.

382
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:21,883
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

383
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:26,724
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was right around the same time that I also got Space Invaders Extreme on my PSP and I just kind of ended up playing that instead.

384
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:28,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah...

385
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:32,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, didn't Duke Nukem 3D come out during that time too?

386
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:33,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it did.

387
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:34,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

388
00:25:34,318 --> 00:25:35,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was one of the big releases too.

389
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:39,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was another one like Doom where I was like, oh my god, it's Doom!

390
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,682
[SPEAKER_04]: They played multiplayer online like once and I was like, okay, I'm going on to other things now.

391
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:47,744
[SPEAKER_05]: But I heard, aren't they making like a Galaga Legions 2?

392
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:49,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't we have a story on the show a few weeks ago about that?

393
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:50,465
[SPEAKER_05]: That they're doing like a second one?

394
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that.

395
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there some type of other reiteration in Galaga?

396
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:54,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

397
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:56,032
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be pretty awesome if they did.

398
00:25:56,873 --> 00:26:01,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, the Xbox Elite is being phased out apparently.

399
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,775
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the rumor going around the internet this week.

400
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:06,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the Xbox 360 is going to be more of like a limited edition type of console.

401
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be so readily available.

402
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:11,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because retailers are not as happy about the Elite apparently.

403
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,320
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the economy the way it is.

404
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,542
[SPEAKER_05]: A system that costs, what, $200 more than the entry level system.

405
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:16,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

406
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:18,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not doing too well.

407
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:27,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently Microsoft might actually be limiting the console sales to only select retailers across North America and Europe.

408
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the Elite might just phase out altogether in quarter two.

409
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:32,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know about that.

410
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:38,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, at least as far as when I'm selling it, we have tons of it on hand.

411
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:40,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So it won't be going away anytime soon.

412
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:52,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know they're doing... Well, I've also... And some thought is that maybe they're phasing this out in favor of the elites will be out for the Resident Evil 5 red box elite system.

413
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:57,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when that phases away and the next big Xbox game comes out, there'll be a limited edition system for that.

414
00:26:57,927 --> 00:26:58,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that they're going to...

415
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:08,496
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be treating it like Sony's doing with their higher end systems like the 160GB system now that's bundled with a game.

416
00:27:09,496 --> 00:27:10,197
[SPEAKER_04]: They may be doing that.

417
00:27:10,557 --> 00:27:14,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see because right now the Elite by itself doesn't seem like a great deal.

418
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:18,944
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you have the Resident Evil release

419
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:19,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

420
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

421
00:27:57,406 --> 00:27:58,046
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

422
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:26,931
[SPEAKER_04]: They should just do it.

423
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:49,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Or something, or a noise filter, I don't know.

424
00:28:49,950 --> 00:29:02,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you should find some sort of noise trapping material, like some sort of, not like how metal would reflect, but maybe a rubber mat or something to put underneath it.

425
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:12,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe finding a different type of... Some cabinets that you can put your systems in actually can put a glass window in front of it with just the little thing for the cords and that kind of filters out the sound.

426
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:13,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

427
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:25,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you get the integrated audio-video setup where it's actually a plug in your wall and you put another one in another room and then you put your system in the other room since the wireless controllers can reach within 30 feet.

428
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:28,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you go, it's another room and you don't have to hear it.

429
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:31,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I could just fucking deal with it as I have for the past few years.

430
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:32,908
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely the way to go.

431
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:34,909
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I can't hear the game.

432
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:36,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I can get headphones.

433
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's another thing.

434
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:39,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Headphones are good.

435
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:43,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you set it next to a PC that's even louder and then it doesn't matter.

436
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Orange Lounge Radio PC.

437
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:48,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's nothing compared to... I don't know if you can hear the monster fan on this thing.

438
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,902
[SPEAKER_05]: It is... I have the loudest... Have you seen my PC?

439
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:53,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in a long time.

440
00:29:54,024 --> 00:29:56,386
[SPEAKER_04]: With its 200mm fan on top of it?

441
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:57,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-mm.

442
00:29:57,927 --> 00:29:59,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got like, you know...

443
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:11,091
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 different fans that are on it, plus there's 3 more inside the case, plus there's a fan on each of the graphics cards that are also hacked to be 100% all the time.

444
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:13,992
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a jet engine.

445
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:16,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I don't want to bitch about noise anymore.

446
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:19,953
[SPEAKER_05]: People are probably sick of it, but I do want to read a comment from chatroom because this made me lull a little bit.

447
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:27,195
[SPEAKER_05]: The comment from chat was from SonOfDad says, Hannah Montana, Xbox 360 Elite SKU for me, please.

448
00:30:27,295 --> 00:30:28,055
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP's doing it.

449
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:30,055
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

450
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Baby poop purple.

451
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:32,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360.

452
00:30:33,896 --> 00:30:43,139
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to join us in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com Well, you know, Rob, that her new movie, she's going to have to choose whether she's going to be Miley Cyrus or Hannah Montana.

453
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:45,379
[SPEAKER_04]: How about she chooses to go jump in a lake?

454
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,080
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be... Or death.

455
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Chooses death.

456
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:52,877
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can't be both, then I won't be any.

457
00:30:54,697 --> 00:30:56,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just have to chop myself in half.

458
00:30:57,218 --> 00:30:58,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with more gaming news.

459
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:01,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do not let Loki ruin my show with Hannah Montana.

460
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:03,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear God, no.

461
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:08,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about something that I'm sure a lot of people have been waiting for.

462
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:11,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, maybe you've been waiting for this.

463
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:11,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

464
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:12,005
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

465
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:14,905
[SPEAKER_08]: The Beatles on Rock Band.

466
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's the Beatles Rock Band Edition.

467
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:21,851
[SPEAKER_08]: A collaboration between AppleCore, Harmonic, and MTV Games.

468
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:26,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be all Beatles music.

469
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:32,662
[SPEAKER_08]: They're basically saying that they don't have any plans yet for downloadable content.

470
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:38,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is going to be standalone, dedicated, just to the Beatles.

471
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:43,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So no importing your songs into other rock band games or any of that stuff is what it seems to imply.

472
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:44,769
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be all by itself.

473
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:47,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, it's the Beatles.

474
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:47,971
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do that.

475
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,052
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like the biggest band ever.

476
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:51,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

477
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:55,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you doubt this, of course I'm excited about a Beatles rock band game.

478
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:58,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially more so than some of these other bands.

479
00:31:58,197 --> 00:32:00,318
[SPEAKER_05]: We've heard Metallica, Aerosmith.

480
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, they're not the Beatles.

481
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,983
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good bands in their own way, but I'm not as excited about that as the Beatles, whose songs have lasted forever.

482
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:07,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

483
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:14,137
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually are also going to be doing a limited edition premium bundle for $250 on all platforms.

484
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:21,244
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii that will have instruments modeled after the ones that the band actually played.

485
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:24,228
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hey, that might mean Hofner bass.

486
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:27,366
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little excessive for me.

487
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:28,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd get it.

488
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:33,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't get it, but I can see where collectors and hardcore Beatles fans would be all over that crap.

489
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,771
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not a surprise.

490
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:36,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for me, I just want the game.

491
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:39,734
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's good for that audience, that they're doing something like that.

492
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:42,695
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

493
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:12,969
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

494
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

495
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:53,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear a controversy on how people think that the Wii version is going to be $59.99 for just the software only?

496
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:54,323
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, $59.99?

497
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:54,724
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

498
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:55,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is only $50.

499
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:56,705
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the cap for Wii games.

500
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:56,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Not $59.99.

501
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:56,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $49.99.

502
00:33:57,006 --> 00:33:57,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Says who?

503
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:11,116
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

504
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:36,720
[SPEAKER_05]: All that aside, you know, $79.99 was a lot of money.

505
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And it certainly was more money than you were seeing for other games at the time.

506
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:41,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe a lot of Super Nintendo games at the time were going for the $49.59.

507
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:46,149
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think they were like $39 or $49 back then.

508
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:48,851
[SPEAKER_05]: But I remember Street Fighter II especially was very expensive.

509
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:49,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was only $69.99.

510
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:52,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remember it was much more expensive.

511
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:53,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was Street Fighter II!

512
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Who didn't want to buy that game back in that day?

513
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:59,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly don't think it's going to come out for $59.99.

514
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:03,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's actually a misprint, but whatever.

515
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:13,569
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to stick with it for now, and they'll have a big controversy, but I don't see a lot of people picking it up for $60 if that's the case, even if it is the Beatles, because who gives a shit?

516
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:14,390
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Beatles.

517
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm not picking it up.

518
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:18,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit about the Beatles, so whatever.

519
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:22,186
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple chatters are correcting, saying it was $69.99.

520
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking like $70 in my mind.

521
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:27,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, Sky, at Toys R Us it was $69.

522
00:35:27,352 --> 00:35:30,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Local shops had it for $79, and GameGuru says it was $69.99.

523
00:35:30,935 --> 00:35:33,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Son of Dad said it was $69.99 at KB Toys.

524
00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:37,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you guys remember that, or if you just looked it up on the internet real quick, but still...

525
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:41,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, they don't charge $69.99 for games now.

526
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:44,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of many games that aren't collector's editions that go for that price.

527
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:53,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm just saying, who's to say they can't charge whatever they want for the game if they know it's going to be in high demand and that people are willing to pay that for, you know, what is arguably going to be a premium game.

528
00:35:53,975 --> 00:36:00,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not like we're talking about, you know, Carnival Games 2 trying to command a price of $59.99.

529
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:03,983
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about the frickin' Beatles.

530
00:36:05,544 --> 00:36:06,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I don't know.

531
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:07,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

532
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:09,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't buy it for the Wii.

533
00:36:10,063 --> 00:36:12,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you talking crap about Carnival Games 2?

534
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:14,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know.

535
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:16,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking crap.

536
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:18,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying I wouldn't pay $69.99 for it.

537
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:21,810
[SPEAKER_05]: If Carnival Games 2, it's worth that kind of money.

538
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:29,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comment from Marissa Congusto in the chat, and I know that's the lovely Marissa who hasn't been on our show in a long time, but I think she needs to grace us with her presence again sometimes.

539
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:34,117
[SPEAKER_05]: True Beatles fans are more nuts about the music than gimmicks.

540
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:35,718
[SPEAKER_05]: But people do get nuts.

541
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:36,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at all the Elvis crap.

542
00:36:37,762 --> 00:37:06,537
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting perspective alright let's move on by the way the release date of this game 999 10 years after the release of the Dreamcast what a fun day to release stuff and I believe as I was hearing on a Bobby show earlier tonight one of their chatters said something Final Fantasy 8 was out on that same day too so September 9th is a fun day for releases 999 Final Fantasy 8 was out on that day too no I think it was out on September 9th of a different year it's not the same it's not quite the same

543
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:11,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so there's another rumor.

544
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:14,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, this isn't actually a rumor.

545
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:16,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it.

546
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:24,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision is preparing to release Guitar Hero Van Halen later this year, August to be exact.

547
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:39,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will be coming out, of course, with some of the more popular Van Halen tracks, Jump, Panama, Hot for Teacher, and also other bands' music are going to be in there, just like the Metallica stuff and Aerosmith.

548
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,245
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you have Jump without keyboards?

549
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:43,105
[SPEAKER_05]: How?

550
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:45,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get that.

551
00:37:45,186 --> 00:37:46,607
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you do that without keyboards?

552
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:49,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know, but I always thought of Jump as a keyboard song.

553
00:37:49,848 --> 00:37:51,469
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, there's a local store in town.

554
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:55,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember if it was Guitar Center or Skips or one of those stores.

555
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,773
[SPEAKER_05]: You had the keyboards all on display at the store, right?

556
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:02,194
[SPEAKER_05]: But they had these big songs that the following songs are banned.

557
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:04,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not play them on these keyboards or we will kick you out of the store.

558
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:05,536
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them was Jump.

559
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't play the chorus.

560
00:38:08,237 --> 00:38:09,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, like you couldn't play it.

561
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that and Fur Elise and all the other stuff.

562
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:14,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they would kick you out of the store if you played that.

563
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:15,342
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hilarious.

564
00:38:16,923 --> 00:38:19,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminds me of that scene from Wayne's World.

565
00:38:19,244 --> 00:38:19,724
[SPEAKER_05]: No stairway.

566
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Denied.

567
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:21,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

568
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:22,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It totally reminded me of that.

569
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:23,587
[SPEAKER_05]: No stairway.

570
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:24,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Denied.

571
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:27,224
[SPEAKER_05]: No Chopsticks.

572
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:28,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Chopsticks had to be one of them.

573
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:39,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Other stuff, other songs that might be in there as well, Juice Priest's Painkiller, Tenacious D's Master Exploder, which you might remember was from Rock Band 2, and Weezer's Dope Nose.

574
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:45,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this is all to be taken as rumor right now, but no, it's not a rumor.

575
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:46,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually coming out.

576
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be just like Guitar Hero Metallica.

577
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:51,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So expect that later on this year.

578
00:38:51,673 --> 00:39:00,181
[SPEAKER_04]: However, that is not all that you can expect later on this year, because that's one of the millions of different Guitar Hero games that are coming out this year.

579
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:02,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, Hero games, including...

580
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:25,585
[SPEAKER_04]: The previously announced Guitar Hero Modern Hits Also supposedly this year Guitar Hero 5 or whatever they're going to call it Band Hero, how that is any different than Guitar Hero 5 is beyond me Another Guitar Hero on Tour game for the DS and DJ Hero

581
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:31,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they weren't kidding when they were talking about the whole five Guitar Hero games in a year or something like that.

582
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:34,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a little overkill if you ask me.

583
00:39:35,885 --> 00:40:05,115
[SPEAKER_05]: but I know I'm not buying any of these so except for DJ Hero maybe that's a maybe Marissa in chat again says it's true about Stairway try playing it in Guitar Center I don't doubt it I'm sure they would get very angry at having to hear that song it's just like I hear on American Idol certain songs are banned from the auditions too like you can't sing Alicia Keys Falling in your audition I don't know why I know that I must have read it on Wikipedia or something Robert M on the last story makes a funny about the release date of the Beatles rock band game the Beatles rock band release date number 9 number 9

584
00:40:05,775 --> 00:40:05,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 9.

585
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:09,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a real nerdy joke there.

586
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:16,702
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also the same day as the 9 is released by Tim Burton, which looks awesome.

587
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a game or a movie?

588
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:19,964
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a movie and a game.

589
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:20,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, of course.

590
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:22,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to ask.

591
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:24,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, if it's a big movie, it's going to be a game as well.

592
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:27,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the next Tim Burton movie was the Alice in Wonderland movie.

593
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,250
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

594
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,431
[SPEAKER_04]: The 9 is the next one.

595
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:30,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

596
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:31,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless Alice in Wonderland.

597
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:32,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Alice is coming out this year.

598
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:33,653
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it's out in 2010.

599
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:33,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

600
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:36,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Alice in Wonderland and all that stuff.

601
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:37,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited about the new movie.

602
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, more Guitar Hero.

603
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:44,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a follow-up to a story we reported on probably a few months ago at this point.

604
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:47,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure our FUs of the Week came right after this particular story.

605
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:50,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember when Gibson sued the makers of Guitar Hero?

606
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:51,087
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

607
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:54,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Gibson had sued over the whole patent they had on

608
00:40:56,432 --> 00:41:00,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Musicians simulating participation in a concert and all this stuff.

609
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,923
[SPEAKER_05]: They tried to claim basically that they invented Guitar Hero.

610
00:41:03,283 --> 00:41:06,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though Guitar Hero worked with them to make the controllers or what have you.

611
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:07,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

612
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:10,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It was lost.

613
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:17,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Their patent suit was lost and essentially was practically laughed out of court is what happened with that.

614
00:41:18,503 --> 00:41:18,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

615
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,204
[SPEAKER_05]: This was from the U.S.

616
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:22,945
[SPEAKER_05]: District Court for the Central District of California.

617
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:24,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

618
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:28,288
[SPEAKER_05]: The court said it's toys that represent other items there.

619
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:37,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, apparently Gibson's patent only originally applied to devices which use the analog audio signals, not MIDI signals or any other types of control signals.

620
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:38,393
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

621
00:41:39,153 --> 00:41:39,594
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

622
00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:42,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Suck it, Gibson.

623
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:47,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was a little bit silly of them in the first place, as we discussed previously.

624
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:49,643
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess you could say justice was served.

625
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:52,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you could say they hacked the Gibson.

626
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:57,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me that.

627
00:41:57,931 --> 00:41:58,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad trombone.

628
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:20,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, while we're on the subject of the guitar games, whatever, Guitar Hero Greatest Hits will be out in June and should have 48 songs including Them Bones by Alice in Chains, Killer Queen, Killing in the Name, Through the Fire and the Flames.

629
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:27,727
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically pulling songs from the other Guitar Hero games and putting them in one game.

630
00:42:29,392 --> 00:42:33,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the only cool thing about this is that now they're going to get the band treatment.

631
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:40,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was reading somewhere that Through the Fire and the Flames is supposed to have crazy hard drums on it to match the crazy hard guitar part.

632
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:41,295
[SPEAKER_05]: But still.

633
00:42:41,455 --> 00:42:42,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play the vocals for that.

634
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:53,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, if you listen carefully, listen carefully, and you might be able to hear the sounds of this franchise getting milked to death.

635
00:42:54,398 --> 00:42:55,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's what's happening.

636
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really.

637
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:56,979
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a slurping noise.

638
00:43:00,054 --> 00:43:09,465
[SPEAKER_05]: The other day I was looking on iTunes, and they have greatest hits for Wilson Phillips.

639
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:14,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Wilson Phillips had two big songs and two CDs.

640
00:43:15,032 --> 00:43:17,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Does this really necessitate a greatest hits album?

641
00:43:18,584 --> 00:43:20,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I feel about this whole Guitar Hero thing.

642
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:25,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there really enough out there that necessitates this Guitar Hero greatest hits album?

643
00:43:25,468 --> 00:43:26,928
[SPEAKER_08]: How about this for more milking, Rob?

644
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:28,369
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be out on Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, and PS2.

645
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,911
[SPEAKER_05]: All the Guitar Hero stuff is milked on all the systems.

646
00:43:58,908 --> 00:44:00,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be like Konami.

647
00:44:00,949 --> 00:44:03,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't hoard DDR.

648
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, at least bring a keyboard or something like that.

649
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:11,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ranma says in chat, Sky, if Rick Astley can have a Greatest Hits album, so can Wilson Phillips.

650
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Good statement, good statement.

651
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,750
[SPEAKER_05]: That could possibly be the chat comment of the evening.

652
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:16,090
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

653
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,651
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into some release dates from around the world, Loki.

654
00:44:20,132 --> 00:44:26,174
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, in the U.S., we have a few games coming out this week, starting off with stuff for the Wii.

655
00:44:26,694 --> 00:44:33,456
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got New Play Control Pikmin and New Play Control Mario Tennis, slightly old but yet new.

656
00:44:34,677 --> 00:44:41,419
[SPEAKER_04]: My Pet Shop for the Nintendo DS, which is being released by Taito, and features Mama from Cooking Mama.

657
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Except now she's working in a pet shop.

658
00:44:45,503 --> 00:44:47,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything I don't want to know?

659
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:49,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I need Mama to fix my life.

660
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:51,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

661
00:44:52,151 --> 00:44:54,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe she's hunting for ingredients.

662
00:44:55,615 --> 00:44:57,036
[SPEAKER_05]: We need relationship, Mama.

663
00:44:57,096 --> 00:44:57,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I need.

664
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:59,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I need Mama to fix my dating life.

665
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:00,300
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I want.

666
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:00,861
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

667
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:05,177
[SPEAKER_04]: EVE Online Special Edition coming out on PC.

668
00:45:06,197 --> 00:45:09,578

00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet another pet fixing sim.

671
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:16,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally.

672
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,820
[SPEAKER_04]: My Sims Party on the DS and on the Wii.

[SPEAKER_04]: Totally Spies, Totally Party on the Wii and on PS2.

675
00:45:28,718 --> 00:45:32,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Docomo, um, Docomo Dake Boing on DS.

676
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a weird game with some giant mushroom, I don't know.

677
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:36,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say that again?

678
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Docomo Dake Boing.

679
00:45:38,343 --> 00:45:46,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Trivial Pursuit coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.

680
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:49,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Mad World on the Wii.

681
00:45:49,648 --> 00:45:50,989

[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, save the best for last, Resident Evil 5 on PS3 and Xbox 360.

688
00:46:53,693 --> 00:46:56,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of Xbox 360, you can get your limited edition

689
00:46:57,874 --> 00:47:00,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Red, Xbox 360 Elite System.

690
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Some praise for MadWorld in chat.

691
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Lazy Days, MadWorld looks cool.

692
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:07,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Deekman, can't wait for MadWorld.

693
00:47:07,363 --> 00:47:11,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's nice to see a Wii game getting some fanboy loving.

694
00:47:11,668 --> 00:47:12,048
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

695
00:47:12,501 --> 00:47:15,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got, okay, it's got John DiMaggio in it.

696
00:47:15,823 --> 00:47:17,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the voice of Bender.

697
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:23,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And Greg Proops from Who's Line doing sports commentary while you murder people with a chainsaw.

698
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:25,089
[SPEAKER_05]: What more do you want?

699
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,290
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty amazing.

700
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I randomly met Greg Proops like years ago.

701
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:31,954
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to see that he's still doing it because, you know, he had that game show.

702
00:47:31,994 --> 00:47:33,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I met him like right around the time he had that game show going on.

703
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:35,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that got canceled.

704
00:47:35,996 --> 00:47:37,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Who's Line wasn't on anymore.

705
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:39,359
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really glad to see he's around still.

706
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so awesome.

707
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

708
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,041
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

709
00:48:03,038 --> 00:48:06,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually found a lot of old photos that I'm actually sorting through and going to throw away the really bad ones.

710
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:10,603
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just found my pictures that I took at a cemetery in Alabama.

711
00:48:11,964 --> 00:48:13,585
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one of you cosplaying as Emmy, though.

712
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that one was really cute.

713
00:48:14,906 --> 00:48:24,313
[SPEAKER_08]: This particular photo that I will go and put on the camera in a second is from the Church Street Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama of the only Revolutionary War veteran buried there.

714
00:48:25,513 --> 00:48:27,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means that he had to have enlisted when he was 15.

715
00:48:29,016 --> 00:48:32,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of love for Greg Proops in our chat room, apparently.

716
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,261
[SPEAKER_05]: He's awesome.

717
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:35,404
[SPEAKER_05]: We should try to get him on the show or something.

718
00:48:35,424 --> 00:48:37,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, I don't know about that.

719
00:48:37,806 --> 00:48:39,909
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like stretching the boundaries of, you know.

720
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:40,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

721
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:41,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

722
00:48:41,371 --> 00:48:43,113
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a voice actor in a video game.

723
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:44,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he wants to sell the game.

724
00:48:44,434 --> 00:48:46,617
[SPEAKER_05]: If the game does well, they'll want him back for a sequel.

725
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:49,686
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know!

726
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:51,127

[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about some UK release dates as soon as I set my photos down?

756
00:51:14,314 --> 00:51:16,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, let me read a quick chat comment while you're doing your photos.

757
00:51:16,755 --> 00:51:23,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire in chat says, When I play Wii Cheer, I actually attach streamers to my Wiimote to make them feel like real pom-poms.

758
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:24,700
[SPEAKER_04]: You joke!

759
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Dork!

760
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,103
[SPEAKER_04]: You joke, but they sell those things for the Wiis.

761
00:51:30,343 --> 00:51:32,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, I'm surprised they don't sell those.

762
00:51:32,164 --> 00:51:33,645
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they do sell those.

763
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:37,748
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell Wii pom-pom attachments for your damn remotes.

764
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:41,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, people are that retarded.

765
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:44,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of want one for some reason, but I'm cheap.

766
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, remember, you can use it for every game.

767
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:50,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I want to play Mad World with my pom-poms.

768
00:51:50,913 --> 00:51:51,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

769
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:52,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Go cheer!

770
00:51:52,473 --> 00:51:52,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

771
00:51:53,054 --> 00:51:53,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Cut you in half.

772
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:54,474
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hilarious.

773
00:51:55,254 --> 00:51:57,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put this on the camera in a moment, or if you want to do it for me.

774
00:51:57,695 --> 00:51:57,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

775
00:51:58,256 --> 00:51:59,696
[SPEAKER_08]: This cat is 27 years old.

776
00:51:59,956 --> 00:52:00,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my heck.

777
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:01,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, get to the release dates.

778
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:03,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me give you the photo.

779
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:04,739
[SPEAKER_08]: His name is Sean.

780
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,821
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my cat from Alabama.

781
00:52:07,242 --> 00:52:11,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, coming out on... I think he's a zombie.

782
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:16,612
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way we can explain that he's lived that long.

783
00:52:16,652 --> 00:52:18,253
[SPEAKER_08]: He's alive by the power of evil.

784
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:22,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already said last week on the 8th and 9th that Flock was out.

785
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:33,442
[SPEAKER_08]: The 10th, Tomb Raider, Underworld, Lara's Shadow on Xbox 360, Bleach, Dark Souls, Codename Panzer's Cold War on PC, Persona 4.

786
00:52:34,103 --> 00:52:35,263
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, those last few were on the 13th.

787
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:50,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Resident Evil 5 on the 13th Resistance Retribution, So Come Frontation, Sonic and the Black Knight, Tom Clancy's Hawks on PC Tiger Claw just linked in chat

788
00:52:51,934 --> 00:52:55,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just saw a picture of those stupid attachments.

789
00:52:59,696 --> 00:53:03,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, I almost want them just for the sheer gayness of it.

790
00:53:03,777 --> 00:53:05,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I feel like I need to own it.

791
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:10,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is, but I'm just compelled to purchase it, even though it only has a one and a half star rating.

792
00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:17,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, $19.99 for two little pieces of plastic that you tape on to the ends of your Wiimotes.

793
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:18,461
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.

794
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:22,762
[SPEAKER_04]: We finally got a skew for the Wii music instruments.

795
00:53:23,263 --> 00:53:28,384
[SPEAKER_04]: They have attachments for all those, too, so you can look like a douchebag playing those.

796
00:53:28,825 --> 00:53:30,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to point out, Amazon looks like they're having a sale.

797
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:38,108
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that and a Wii Cheer and All-Star Cheer Squad, all three together, $84.97 for the Ultimate Cheerleader.

798
00:53:41,271 --> 00:53:41,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

799
00:53:41,872 --> 00:53:42,172
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

800
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:43,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

801
00:53:44,473 --> 00:53:48,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, there's going to be a new Pac-Man game on the way.

802
00:53:49,316 --> 00:53:52,938
[SPEAKER_04]: This is to celebrate the game's 30th anniversary.

803
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:53,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Good Lord.

804
00:53:54,038 --> 00:53:58,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I remember just a few years ago when we were at E3 when they were celebrating the 25th anniversary.

805
00:53:59,982 --> 00:54:02,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, the 30th anniversary will become...

806
00:54:02,603 --> 00:54:06,046
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

807
00:54:27,203 --> 00:54:45,540
[SPEAKER_04]: and I guess Yasuhara is part of it and says the new game design was sort of meeting his wish 100% so I have no idea what the hell that means but it's going to be a Pac-Man game so set your expectations low!

808
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, the last Pac-Man game that came out was really awesome.

809
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:50,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man Championship Edition was pretty great.

810
00:54:50,942 --> 00:54:52,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Even Pac-Man Versus was pretty fun, too.

811
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:55,924
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, I mean, not every Pac-Man game has been a winner.

812
00:54:56,144 --> 00:54:56,884
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Pac-Man.

813
00:54:56,924 --> 00:55:02,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like, if Pac-Man ran faster, we'd be having the same problem as Sonic.

814
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:04,886
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh...

815
00:55:06,634 --> 00:55:08,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious to see how they're going to reinvent Pac-Man.

816
00:55:09,136 --> 00:55:10,256
[SPEAKER_04]: There were Pac-Pix.

817
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:11,977
[SPEAKER_04]: That seemed like a good idea.

818
00:55:12,478 --> 00:55:13,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Pac-Pix.

819
00:55:13,278 --> 00:55:15,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Until you played it, and then you're like, wow, this sucks.

820
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:20,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Pac-Pix, it was one of those things that was neat in a small dose.

821
00:55:20,302 --> 00:55:24,524
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great demo to show the DS off with, but as a game...

822
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I just found a picture of Jason

823
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:52,006
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

824
00:55:52,447 --> 00:55:53,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Our webmaster, Jason?

825
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:55,029
[SPEAKER_05]: How old are these pictures?

826
00:55:55,049 --> 00:55:55,689
[SPEAKER_05]: What are these all from?

827
00:55:55,729 --> 00:55:55,789
[SPEAKER_05]: E3.

828
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:57,210
[SPEAKER_08]: You dig up.

829
00:55:57,971 --> 00:55:58,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost.

830
00:55:58,832 --> 00:55:59,532
[SPEAKER_05]: 04, probably, right?

831
00:55:59,812 --> 00:56:00,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

832
00:56:00,313 --> 00:56:01,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I found a really bad picture of us.

833
00:56:02,274 --> 00:56:02,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, boy.

834
00:56:03,855 --> 00:56:04,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I remember that picture.

835
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:05,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Blurry.

836
00:56:05,517 --> 00:56:05,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I look cute.

837
00:56:06,277 --> 00:56:06,758
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, hey.

838
00:56:07,518 --> 00:56:09,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about pictures makes for great radio, doesn't it?

839
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:09,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it does.

840
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Konami.

841
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,163
[SPEAKER_05]: You know our friends at Konami, they are turning 40 years old this week, if you can believe it.

842
00:56:16,183 --> 00:56:17,244
[SPEAKER_05]: You're over the hill!

843
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:19,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, Konami, you're old.

844
00:56:19,966 --> 00:56:25,629
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Konami has officially turned 40 this week, and quoting on the age of the company and how they did it,

845
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:32,294
[SPEAKER_05]: President Kuno Nio says, Consistency plays a major part in everything Konami does.

846
00:56:32,374 --> 00:56:34,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that means rehashing their games over and over.

847
00:56:34,836 --> 00:56:35,357
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

848
00:56:35,777 --> 00:56:40,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, Konami's put out a lot of great games that we've loved very much over the years, so there you have it.

849
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami also promises that there are a wealth of other new titles in development.

850
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:52,690
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, a game that I left out of my gaming week was the DDR on the iPhone was a game that I actually played this week, the brand new one.

851
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,431
[SPEAKER_05]: They have DDR on iPhone now.

852
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:55,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

853
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,496
[SPEAKER_05]: It's alright, you know, considering it's DDR on your iPhone.

854
00:56:59,536 --> 00:57:01,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you don't actually dance.

855
00:57:01,238 --> 00:57:02,559
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

856
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:09,967
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this new mode they have called Shake Mode where you actually play DDR by tilting your iPhone to the left and to the right and up and back.

857
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:11,549
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, which is kind of stupid but cute.

858
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:12,930
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the weird thing.

859
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,934
[SPEAKER_05]: You only can play the tutorial song in Shake Mode.

860
00:57:16,735 --> 00:57:17,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a bug?

861
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:18,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously?

862
00:57:18,698 --> 00:57:20,942
[SPEAKER_05]: You were only meant to play the tutorial song and nothing else?

863
00:57:21,122 --> 00:57:27,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Did somebody forget to put that pointer in that says, Oh, after the tutorial, go back to the song select and not the main menu.

864
00:57:27,774 --> 00:57:28,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

865
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:32,614
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

866
00:57:50,749 --> 00:57:52,929
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a lot of newer DDR songs.

867
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:55,290
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some old-ass stuff mixed in there.

868
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing that surprised me most.

869
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know Brilliant 2 U now has a vocal version?

870
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:02,111
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of scary.

871
00:58:02,431 --> 00:58:03,132
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say.

872
00:58:03,552 --> 00:58:09,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been out of the DDR loop for so long, I had no idea there was a Brilliant 2 U now with vocals.

873
00:58:09,513 --> 00:58:10,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Paul Terry singing?

874
00:58:10,933 --> 00:58:18,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it that really awful dude that did that crappy rap that was in... It could very well be, for all I know.

875
00:58:19,505 --> 00:58:22,414
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

876
00:58:27,669 --> 00:58:30,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Get these kids off your damn lawn

877
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:03,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's just... I can't be excited about this stuff anymore.

878
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:07,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be more excited about DDR when there's something that's really reinvented it.

879
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:12,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't know, even just going to different... I have a way to do it, but no one wants to give me the money to do it.

880
00:59:14,192 --> 00:59:14,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

881
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

882
00:59:16,413 --> 00:59:17,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Some more gaming news.

883
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:20,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough reminiscing about the past 40 years of Konami.

884
00:59:21,136 --> 00:59:23,338
[SPEAKER_08]: But we like the past.

885
00:59:23,985 --> 00:59:24,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.

886
00:59:24,487 --> 00:59:28,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I think back to the Konami of the 80s, the old school Metal Gear game was amazing.

887
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:28,721
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway...

888
00:59:29,124 --> 00:59:33,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about some different news?

889
00:59:33,426 --> 00:59:42,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubisoft has actually pulled a game called I Am Alive that's being developed by Darkworks from their lineup.

890
00:59:42,191 --> 00:59:53,317
[SPEAKER_08]: They announced at E3 that they wanted to release it this spring, but it's actually been delayed until March 2010 because it's apparently such an ambitious title that they want to do it justice.

891
00:59:54,538 --> 00:59:56,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's hope so.

892
00:59:56,587 --> 00:59:57,367
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny, though.

893
00:59:57,407 --> 00:59:58,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, they announced it.

894
00:59:58,308 --> 00:59:59,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's coming out in March.

895
00:59:59,749 --> 01:00:03,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're like, uh, yeah, about that.

896
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually financial year 2010.

897
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:05,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Oopsie.

898
01:00:07,072 --> 01:00:10,374
[SPEAKER_04]: We jumped the gun there.

899
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometime between now and March.

900
01:00:14,116 --> 01:00:14,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

901
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:15,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

902
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,294
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something else that's kind of interesting.

903
01:00:19,334 --> 01:00:23,917
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember we talked a little bit about it that Square Enix was starting to buy up some shares of Eidos.

904
01:00:24,478 --> 01:00:29,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Square Enix is hoping to finish buying the rest of Eidos by May.

905
01:00:29,941 --> 01:00:37,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're actually expected to approve a deal with the Eidos shareholders later this month.

906
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:44,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully by, I guess, May 6th, there will be...

907
01:00:46,525 --> 01:00:46,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

908
01:00:49,468 --> 01:00:51,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they'll be under the ownership of Square Enix.

909
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:53,031
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of interesting, though.

910
01:00:53,671 --> 01:00:56,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my thoughts are, why would you want Eidos?

911
01:00:56,614 --> 01:00:58,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, it's Eidos.

912
01:01:00,096 --> 01:01:01,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they do own Tomb Raider, right?

913
01:01:01,718 --> 01:01:07,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a new Tomb Raider movie coming out, so maybe they're going to try and do a different type of Tomb Raider game for it.

914
01:01:08,303 --> 01:01:08,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

915
01:01:09,504 --> 01:01:11,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe try to reboot some of the franchises.

916
01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:13,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't Eidos also have a Hitman that they have?

917
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:14,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Square Eidox Square Eidox

918
01:01:44,944 --> 01:01:48,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Guru in chat says Square Enix wants franchises that aren't JRPGs.

919
01:01:48,947 --> 01:01:55,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And that could be, you know, there has been those stories about they want to get more into, you know, the more American style of the game development.

920
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:55,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So why not?

921
01:01:57,668 --> 01:02:03,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I mean, this is about like half a step from, you know, buying out Atari or something.

922
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:07,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no offense, it's just like, Eidos is not what they used to be.

923
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:09,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomb Raider is definitely not what it used to be.

924
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:15,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, their other franchises, you know, the ones that they still put out aren't what they used to be.

925
01:02:15,312 --> 01:02:16,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And they haven't been really that great.

926
01:02:16,993 --> 01:02:19,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they obviously see something in it that maybe they can turn around.

927
01:02:19,774 --> 01:02:21,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's why they're able to buy them out.

928
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:22,937
[SPEAKER_04]: The shares are so low.

929
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:23,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

930
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just whatever.

931
01:02:25,903 --> 01:02:32,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're square and you've got lots of money, then I guess it's fine to buy Eidos.

932
01:02:34,093 --> 01:02:44,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hey, this game company seems to be doing something right, because apparently, according to Nintendo Power's recent issue, A Boy and His Blob is coming back on the Wii pretty soon.

933
01:02:44,739 --> 01:02:45,379
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

934
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:48,621
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming from WayForward, is the company that's making this game.

935
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:52,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you might remember, a little while ago, they were kind of testing this on the DS.

936
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:57,025
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a DS version of the game that was under development, but then it ended up getting cancelled.

937
01:02:57,045 --> 01:02:59,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember playing this at E3, going like, wow, it's A Boy and His Blob.

938
01:03:00,287 --> 01:03:01,387
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, apparently...

939
01:03:02,828 --> 01:03:08,191
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be reinvented on the Wii, and there's more information in this month's Nintendo Power Magazine, so that could be interesting.

940
01:03:08,331 --> 01:03:09,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember A Boy and His Blob?

941
01:03:09,532 --> 01:03:09,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

942
01:03:09,612 --> 01:03:10,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a neat game.

943
01:03:10,773 --> 01:03:16,636
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of a short game, but you know, back on the NES, it was kind of okay, because it took a long time to figure out how to beat it unless you had a cheat guide.

944
01:03:17,056 --> 01:03:18,037
[SPEAKER_05]: But this could be kind of cool.

945
01:03:19,437 --> 01:03:21,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's a remake of the first game, though.

946
01:03:21,318 --> 01:03:23,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's probably a whole new thing.

947
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:25,400
[SPEAKER_05]: But it definitely was an interesting concept.

948
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,982
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't remember what A Boy and His Blob was, basically, it was kind of a puzzle game.

949
01:03:30,042 --> 01:03:43,268
[SPEAKER_05]: You had the blob, and you were the boy, and you could walk around, the little blob would follow you, and if you fed the blob different flavors of jelly beans, then the blob would turn into different objects, like the blob could turn into a ladder, the blob could turn into a trampoline, or a key.

950
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:46,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It would just basically shapeshift all these different things, so you were kind of

951
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:47,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

952
01:04:09,368 --> 01:04:11,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun in chat points out that WayForward also made Contra 4.

953
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:15,595
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTatooia asks about the brick wall trick.

954
01:04:15,655 --> 01:04:16,476
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't remember that.

955
01:04:16,516 --> 01:04:19,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I do seem to remember there was a really easy way you could cheat in Boy and His Blobs.

956
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That must be what he's talking about.

957
01:04:22,222 --> 01:04:24,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Shadow asks, is Jelly Belly paying for this?

958
01:04:24,165 --> 01:04:24,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

959
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:25,586
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a good sponsorship.

960
01:04:26,127 --> 01:04:26,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Jelly Bellys.

961
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:27,849
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they have Jelly Belly.

962
01:04:28,676 --> 01:04:29,177
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

963
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:49,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know Jelly Belly doesn't make the Harry Potter beans anymore.

964
01:04:50,122 --> 01:04:55,906
[SPEAKER_05]: They, uh, I guess lost the licensing agreement with that, so now they have their own, like, sad flavor of jelly beans lined.

965
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:59,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, have you ever had those nasty Jelly Bellys, like in the, you know, vomit flavor and all that stuff?

966
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:00,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know any Jelly Bellys.

967
01:05:01,459 --> 01:05:01,799
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

968
01:05:26,272 --> 01:05:27,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, look for yourself.

969
01:05:27,773 --> 01:05:28,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

970
01:05:29,314 --> 01:05:30,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, let's see.

971
01:05:30,756 --> 01:05:34,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone did a parody of what the Watchmen ending was going to be like.

972
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:37,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is this going to spoil the actual movie because I haven't seen it yet?

973
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:37,841
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Rob, it won't.

974
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Candy Mountain.

975
01:05:41,661 --> 01:05:42,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

976
01:05:42,602 --> 01:05:43,603
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fantastic.

977
01:05:43,623 --> 01:05:44,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that's terrible radio.

978
01:05:46,024 --> 01:05:47,485
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically, never mind.

979
01:05:47,505 --> 01:05:49,067
[SPEAKER_05]: At least our live listeners can look at that.

980
01:05:49,747 --> 01:05:53,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, how about some UK Virtual Console stuff?

981
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,071
[SPEAKER_08]: And this makes me happy.

982
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun stuff.

983
01:05:56,692 --> 01:05:57,913
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Clu Clu Land.

984
01:05:59,114 --> 01:06:00,274
[SPEAKER_08]: We remember Clu Clu Land.

985
01:06:00,795 --> 01:06:01,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

986
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:03,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember playing Animal Crossing on the GameCube.

987
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:08,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, and I played it on the Nintendo when it was new, back in the day.

988
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:15,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, you just have to turn bubbles and make gems and stuff, and it's 500 Wii Points.

989
01:06:15,952 --> 01:06:20,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, Mega Drive title, Wonder Boy 3 Monster Lair.

990
01:06:22,015 --> 01:06:26,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So, which I think we got it was Wonder Boy Monster Land.

991
01:06:26,136 --> 01:06:29,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we just got that on Virtual Console ourselves over here, too.

992
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:31,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's 800 Wii Points.

993
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:33,239
[SPEAKER_08]: So, go get them!

994
01:06:36,222 --> 01:06:38,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Go get them!

995
01:06:38,524 --> 01:06:40,386
[SPEAKER_08]: 280 games for the Virtual Console available now.

996
01:06:41,227 --> 01:06:44,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I'm not interested in any of them, unfortunately.

997
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:45,450
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot.

998
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:46,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Still no Guardian Legend.

999
01:06:47,072 --> 01:06:47,712
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to know what?

1000
01:06:48,113 --> 01:06:49,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably have that many in the vault.

1001
01:06:51,996 --> 01:06:52,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I was joking.

1002
01:06:53,317 --> 01:06:54,739
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I wouldn't doubt it.

1003
01:06:54,759 --> 01:06:57,681
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, a lot of... I probably have that many ROMs.

1004
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:58,162
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

1005
01:06:58,242 --> 01:06:59,683
[SPEAKER_08]: You know kind of why I wish I was joking?

1006
01:07:00,023 --> 01:07:00,223
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1007
01:07:00,243 --> 01:07:01,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're sorting them all.

1008
01:07:02,592 --> 01:07:04,295
[SPEAKER_05]: ExciteBots Trick Racing

1009
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:20,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually got some details on it, other than just the name now.

1010
01:07:21,828 --> 01:07:27,433
[SPEAKER_04]: We have pictures of the box art that came out, which looks interesting.

1011
01:07:27,553 --> 01:07:30,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was promptly stolen and put all around the rest of the internet.

1012
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:32,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I don't give a shit, so whatever.

1013
01:07:33,798 --> 01:07:37,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, yeah, box art which shows robotic animals and...

1014
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:41,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with wheels and stuff.

1015
01:07:41,284 --> 01:07:41,804
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of neat.

1016
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:48,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And another interesting stuff, and before I was kind of worried, the description made it sound like a party game and stuff.

1017
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually looks like Excite Truck, and it looks pretty sweet.

1018
01:07:52,473 --> 01:08:01,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there is weird stuff in there, like there's a robotic turtle carrying a tambourine for some reason, and I'm not sure why.

1019
01:08:02,722 --> 01:08:05,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's some other stuff that I saw with, like...

1020
01:08:06,513 --> 01:08:08,195
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1021
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:24,670
[SPEAKER_04]: The game basically plays very similar to Excite Truck.

1022
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It's based on a star system.

1023
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:38,032
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get in first place, which obviously helps you, but if you don't get in first place, it doesn't really matter because it's all about who has the most star points at the end of the race.

1024
01:08:38,173 --> 01:08:44,514
[SPEAKER_04]: You get points for doing different things like tree runs, catching air, doing air tricks, etc.

1025
01:08:45,034 --> 01:09:13,810
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, jumps, whatnot So, very similar to Excite Truck The controls are going to be exactly the same And they've added a few different things in there as well Now they have these new, like, energy pulls That you can swing around and gain a boost off of that Lots of fun stuff And then there's also some other game modes in there as well Hopefully optional That you can play poker by driving through cards And then, you know, based on what you get You get points on, you know, the hands or something like that

1026
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:21,226
[SPEAKER_04]: and then also the clown thing which I don't know what how that plays but you basically throw a pie at a clown as you're driving around but um

1027
01:09:22,532 --> 01:09:24,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Nonetheless, it looks interesting.

1028
01:09:24,353 --> 01:09:27,574
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got vehicles flying through the air and stuff like that.

1029
01:09:27,754 --> 01:09:32,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, you get a power-up where your character is able to run with its legs and stuff.

1030
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Any word about internet play, like Mario Kart?

1031
01:09:36,577 --> 01:09:41,478
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no word on that, but as I remember mentioning before, two to six players online.

1032
01:09:42,218 --> 01:09:42,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1033
01:09:44,199 --> 01:09:47,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And one to two players split-screen local.

1034
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very interested in checking this out.

1035
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:52,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And the wife is extremely excited.

1036
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:55,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks interesting, but here's the thing about it.

1037
01:09:55,655 --> 01:10:00,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't we hear that this developer was working on something that was so secret they had to have the secret screens and all this stuff?

1038
01:10:00,798 --> 01:10:08,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if maybe somebody was just embellishing it or whatever, but I'm really thinking in the back of my mind, okay, is this game really that big of a deal that they had to keep it super top secret?

1039
01:10:09,488 --> 01:10:10,148
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks good.

1040
01:10:10,589 --> 01:10:12,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does look good compared to Excite Truck.

1041
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, the graphics are a lot better.

1042
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:16,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1043
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:17,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very interested to check it out.

1044
01:10:18,092 --> 01:10:19,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they could have a really good game on their hands.

1045
01:10:20,413 --> 01:10:24,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think the robotic lizard frog thing is kind of cool.

1046
01:10:24,955 --> 01:10:27,876
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have a mouse in there they can play as, a robotic mouse.

1047
01:10:27,916 --> 01:10:29,137
[SPEAKER_04]: But the turtle looks retarded.

1048
01:10:29,197 --> 01:10:29,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1049
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:30,938
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got this retarded, like...

1050
01:10:31,892 --> 01:10:33,874
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1051
01:10:58,616 --> 01:11:01,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, King Hippo, obviously we've seen in some screenshots.

1052
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:02,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Glass Joe, you know, is going to be in there.

1053
01:11:02,919 --> 01:11:05,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Von Kaiser, apparently, is going to be making a comeback.

1054
01:11:06,121 --> 01:11:10,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Not exactly one of the fighters I would have thought would be the best of the original, which started to make me fearful.

1055
01:11:11,365 --> 01:11:15,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think somebody said on this show a couple weeks ago, maybe this is just going to be a complete remake of the first game.

1056
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:16,528
[SPEAKER_04]: PUNCH OUT PUNCH OUT

1057
01:11:37,643 --> 01:11:40,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, classic NES style controls.

1058
01:11:40,905 --> 01:11:45,408
[SPEAKER_05]: If you flip your Wii remote on the side and play the game, you can play the game that way.

1059
01:11:45,788 --> 01:11:49,270
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of cool for those of us that don't want to flail our arms around everywhere.

1060
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:51,412
[SPEAKER_05]: You can still have some fun with Punch-Out!

1061
01:11:52,132 --> 01:11:52,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1062
01:11:53,533 --> 01:11:55,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, obviously Punch-Out!!

1063
01:11:55,074 --> 01:12:02,316
[SPEAKER_05]: is a very classic video game, but we like to put the spotlight on a classic game every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I can tell you this week it's not Punch-Out!!

1064
01:12:02,716 --> 01:12:07,698
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is some game that you should definitely be checking out, and it's DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

1065
01:12:07,818 --> 01:12:09,599
[SPEAKER_05]: She's gonna dig through her archives.

1066
01:12:10,635 --> 01:12:12,656
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what is the classic video game of the week?

1067
01:12:30,443 --> 01:12:32,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Characters from Madomonogatari.

1068
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:40,755
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just a fun little game where you drop these bean-shaped thingies and have to match them up.

1069
01:12:40,855 --> 01:12:45,380
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can do drops and make chain combos.

1070
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,742
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's been one of the...

1071
01:12:49,684 --> 01:12:54,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I say blueprints for many other puzzle games to come out since.

1072
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:57,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of like Puzzle Fighter, remember?

1073
01:12:57,793 --> 01:12:59,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you had your chains and everything.

1074
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:05,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, we got it at the USS Puyo Pop.

1075
01:13:06,501 --> 01:13:12,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And we first saw it, though, as Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine for the Genesis Mega Drive.

1076
01:13:12,283 --> 01:13:17,624
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out on Game Gear and Master System, but that version actually only came out in Europe and Brazil.

1077
01:13:18,325 --> 01:13:28,988
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we got it as Kirby's Ghost Trap, which was the European SNES version, and Kirby's Avalanche, which was our version over here.

1078
01:13:31,551 --> 01:13:56,094
[SPEAKER_08]: So, basically, the whole point of it is that you have to stack up, like I said, you have to stack up Puyo, and you have to match them up and get them in certain combos so that you can throw that many number of lines over on your enemy, who is also playing simultaneously with the enemy or the computer.

1079
01:13:56,494 --> 01:14:05,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And they can block your moves by getting combos of their own, but basically whoever has a higher combo, then they get to sit over there.

1080
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:09,083
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually called Rensa.

1081
01:14:10,824 --> 01:14:13,866
[SPEAKER_08]: The chain of how they pop and fall is called Rensa.

1082
01:14:14,647 --> 01:14:19,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can have any different kind of variety of it for how they fall.

1083
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:29,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and the blocks that fall on the other side are called, um, Ojama, which, um, are garbage blocks, pretty much.

1084
01:14:30,116 --> 01:14:32,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, or as we get them, they're new sets of Puyo.

1085
01:14:32,897 --> 01:14:41,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, basically, like I said, the higher that you get, the, you know, the more that you drop on your opponent that they do not block, you know.

1086
01:14:42,703 --> 01:14:42,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1087
01:14:45,322 --> 01:14:48,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, this battle I'm watching on YouTube is quite epic.

1088
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:51,227
[SPEAKER_05]: My god, these players are amazing.

1089
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:53,488
[SPEAKER_05]: They're setting up chains left and right.

1090
01:14:53,688 --> 01:14:58,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I have seen the 19 chain rob that someone managed to get.

1091
01:14:58,892 --> 01:14:59,793
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty freaking epic.

1092
01:15:00,093 --> 01:15:02,155
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, this version of the music is from Puyo Puyo 2.

1093
01:15:03,596 --> 01:15:05,597
[SPEAKER_08]: But I thought it was cool.

1094
01:15:05,998 --> 01:15:08,519
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically, you've got a single P.O.

1095
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:13,722
[SPEAKER_08]: where basically you just fight the computer, and then you have the versus mode, which is double P.O.P.O.

1096
01:15:14,523 --> 01:15:27,211
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got characters in the game, which we've seen a few of them in other games, because actually, Carbuncle made his way, made a brief appearance in Dr. Robotnik's B&B Machine, and it was called Has-Been in that game.

1097
01:15:27,811 --> 01:15:44,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but you have, um, uh, Arl, um, Naja, who is the main character, the blue girl with brown hair wearing a blue dress, and, um, you also, you know, also some of her, uh, chains, she calls out different spells because her character is apparently a sorceress.

1098
01:15:46,246 --> 01:15:47,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yep, and then you've got Carbuncle.

1099
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:49,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Carbuncle is cute.

1100
01:15:50,367 --> 01:15:52,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, for the first P.O.P.O.

1101
01:15:52,607 --> 01:16:07,110
[SPEAKER_08]: you go through Skeleton T, Nasu Grave, Mummy, uh, Draco Centauros, um, Skadoldora, um, Skiapodes, um, Parpy, you know, you've got, you actually have Zombie too, which I think is cool.

1102
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, my favorite name here is Zodamayo.

1103
01:16:11,271 --> 01:16:12,831
[SPEAKER_08]: And your end boss is Satan.

1104
01:16:14,877 --> 01:16:19,602
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and you have to fight him because, um, he likes Arl, but he really likes Carbuckle.

1105
01:16:21,364 --> 01:16:34,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, as far as other versions that have come out, like I said, we've had the US ones, um, that was, uh, Dr. Robotnik's B&B Machine, Kirby's Avalanche, um, there, uh,

1106
01:16:36,067 --> 01:16:43,838
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually say that the Puyo were supposed to be like how the slimes were in Dragon Quest.

1107
01:16:43,898 --> 01:16:49,926
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually from that RPG game Mago Monogatari, which if anyone's played it, I'd love to know.

1108
01:16:50,026 --> 01:16:50,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't.

1109
01:16:50,987 --> 01:17:06,855
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, as other games came out, there was the Neo Geo Pocket, Neo Geo Pocket Color one, so we've had Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, we've had Puyo Pop over here in Japan, it was Mina de Puyo Puyo, which means Everybody Puyo Puyo.

1110
01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:20,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we've had Puyo Puyo Sun, which there's actually a Nintendo 64 version, Puyo Puyo Sun 64, and a Saturn version, and Puyo Puyon, which was, um, pretty much the second one.

1111
01:17:20,526 --> 01:17:24,470
[SPEAKER_08]: We also had Puyo Puyo Fever, um, which we got as Puyo Puyo Pop Fever.

1112
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:31,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that was on, uh, actually that was the last game that was released for Dreamcast.

1113
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:48,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox, PlayStation 2, GBA, GameCube, DS, PSP, Mac, Windows, Pocket PC, Palm, DS, etc.

1114
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:54,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have the TurboGrafx version at home.

1115
01:17:54,982 --> 01:17:56,863
[SPEAKER_05]: They made this game on every damn system, basically.

1116
01:17:57,103 --> 01:18:00,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and you know there was actually a music game sequel...

1117
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:01,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember.

1118
01:18:01,845 --> 01:18:03,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you showed it to me once.

1119
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:03,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you showed it to me once.

1120
01:18:03,827 --> 01:18:05,329
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Puyo Da.

1121
01:18:05,529 --> 01:18:07,551
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't the greatest, but it was... I thought it was cute.

1122
01:18:07,611 --> 01:18:08,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was different.

1123
01:18:08,812 --> 01:18:10,033
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fun little game.

1124
01:18:10,113 --> 01:18:10,573
[SPEAKER_05]: It was different.

1125
01:18:10,874 --> 01:18:16,319
[SPEAKER_08]: With Puyo Da, it's like you have to hit the buttons at the right time, sort of like a Parappa-ish thing.

1126
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:22,284
[SPEAKER_08]: But depending on how many you get right and how many they get right, you get more points than they get bombed.

1127
01:18:22,604 --> 01:18:25,047
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's an interesting little spinoff.

1128
01:18:26,809 --> 01:18:28,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well that's going to do it.

1129
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:28,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

1130
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:36,233
[SPEAKER_08]: This had the line in there, though, that I know that it's not what she's saying, but it's like the game Psychic Storm.

1131
01:18:36,373 --> 01:18:38,754
[SPEAKER_08]: You translate the line the same way as I get pissed off.

1132
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:43,916
[SPEAKER_08]: My husband's crazy.

1133
01:18:44,856 --> 01:18:47,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I believe that is going to do it for your Classic Game of the Week.

1134
01:18:47,677 --> 01:18:49,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope he's listening because I picked this for him.

1135
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Puyo Puyo Puyo Puyo Puyo

1136
01:19:10,004 --> 01:19:27,170
[SPEAKER_05]: and also I would say if you want to get like a recent version of Puyo Puyo check out the Sonic Genesis collection because it has you know Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine which granted isn't a pure quote unquote version of Puyo Puyo but you get at least the gist of the game itself and you know it's part of that big collection so

1137
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:28,371
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go!

1138
01:19:28,751 --> 01:19:29,932
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1139
01:19:29,972 --> 01:19:30,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Puyo Puyo.

1140
01:19:30,753 --> 01:19:37,320
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back with plenty more in Part B. We're going to talk about other companies getting into used game businesses.

1141
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,061
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be interesting.

1142
01:19:38,101 --> 01:19:39,322
[SPEAKER_05]: And other game rental methods.

1143
01:19:39,703 --> 01:19:41,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And some classic fighting games.

1144
01:19:41,865 --> 01:19:44,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of some more 2D fighters in the wake of Street Fighter 4.

1145
01:19:44,548 --> 01:19:49,053
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be talking about some of that coming up next here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1146
01:19:49,133 --> 01:19:49,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned!

1147
01:19:56,018 --> 01:20:03,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, March the 8th of 2009, where we are taping live on allgames.com.

1148
01:20:04,123 --> 01:20:12,607
[SPEAKER_05]: www.allgames.com is the radio network that we are a part of, or if you want to check out our show specifically, you can check out www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1149
01:20:12,647 --> 01:20:14,228
[SPEAKER_05]: You really should, though, check out both.

1150
01:20:14,589 --> 01:20:18,511
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you get a lot of time to surf the internet, I'm sure, so you should check both sites out because they're both great.

1151
01:20:19,071 --> 01:20:22,013
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we've been talking a lot about the latest and greatest in gaming.

1152
01:20:22,033 --> 01:20:22,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not done yet.

1153
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:23,694
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got plenty more.

1154
01:20:24,035 --> 01:20:26,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk a little more business now, Loki.

1155
01:20:26,816 --> 01:20:28,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, let's talk business.

1156
01:20:29,418 --> 01:20:34,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Toys R Us is actually going to try to get into the used game business.

1157
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:38,164
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to start doing trade-ins, I guess.

1158
01:20:39,425 --> 01:20:45,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, an in-store advertisement, which was snapped by one of the CheapAssGamer fans,

1159
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:47,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1160
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:07,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, you'll be able to return your games for, I guess, Jeffrey Bucks, maybe?

1161
01:21:07,783 --> 01:21:08,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

1162
01:21:08,844 --> 01:21:11,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it'll be kind of similar to the other... That means like a gift certificate, right?

1163
01:21:11,487 --> 01:21:12,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

1164
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:17,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeffrey the Giraffe Dollars, which, you know, have no currency whatsoever in...

1165
01:21:17,952 --> 01:21:18,452
[SPEAKER_04]: The Real World.

1166
01:21:18,933 --> 01:21:29,901
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, you will be able to sell your used games back and receive store credits and no word on any pricing tiers or whether they're going to be competitive or not.

1167
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:34,865
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, another option for trading in your used games is always welcome.

1168
01:21:36,314 --> 01:21:40,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, to be honest, man, the last time I went to the Toys R Us, it was sad.

1169
01:21:40,616 --> 01:21:45,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, half the store was converted into a Baby's R Us, and that was really sad.

1170
01:21:46,218 --> 01:21:47,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that's what sells, you know.

1171
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a crap about it.

1172
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the Toys R Us was the shit when I was a kid.

1173
01:21:51,521 --> 01:21:51,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It was!

1174
01:21:52,001 --> 01:21:52,881
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing.

1175
01:21:53,022 --> 01:21:54,162
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so amazing.

1176
01:21:54,922 --> 01:21:57,804
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, now they have Baby's R Us in there.

1177
01:21:59,004 --> 01:22:00,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, if it sells, it sells, right?

1178
01:22:02,187 --> 01:22:17,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remember back in the day, they used to have the Atari 2600 thing set up, you could play the old school games on there But it's cutting into my LEGO aisle Maybe that's because they have a LEGO store at the mall Wait, what mall?

1179
01:22:17,578 --> 01:22:19,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Arden Mall, they have a full LEGO store now

1180
01:22:20,745 --> 01:22:21,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you shitting me?

1181
01:22:21,446 --> 01:22:22,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not shitting you.

1182
01:22:22,206 --> 01:22:23,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I gotta go!

1183
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:25,589
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so awesome!

1184
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:27,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It's apparently like a chain of stores now.

1185
01:22:27,531 --> 01:22:27,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Good!

1186
01:22:28,352 --> 01:22:29,313
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a Lego store.

1187
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:31,174
[SPEAKER_04]: They can get rid of the Apple store anytime, though.

1188
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:32,956
[SPEAKER_04]: But Lego store is awesome.

1189
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:35,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not know you had such a fan boner for Legos.

1190
01:22:35,998 --> 01:22:37,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I have 10 gallons of Legos.

1191
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I measure my Legos in volume now.

1192
01:22:40,883 --> 01:22:41,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1193
01:22:41,844 --> 01:22:46,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Between her video game vault and your Legos, I feel like I need something.

1194
01:22:46,388 --> 01:22:47,108
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I do have?

1195
01:22:47,249 --> 01:22:49,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a full dresser drawer.

1196
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:51,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Full dresser drawer full of Pez dispensers.

1197
01:22:52,473 --> 01:22:52,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have that.

1198
01:22:53,114 --> 01:22:53,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1199
01:22:53,414 --> 01:22:54,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's my thing.

1200
01:22:54,355 --> 01:22:54,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1201
01:22:55,674 --> 01:22:56,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1202
01:23:12,942 --> 01:23:14,903
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've seen those for sale, though.

1203
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:16,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of quit Pez collecting for a little while.

1204
01:23:17,023 --> 01:23:19,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Something I did in high school and for a little while after that.

1205
01:23:19,384 --> 01:23:26,347
[SPEAKER_05]: But the nice thing is, since I stopped for so long, now I have a lot of old Pez dispensers that have just been sitting in a desk drawer, not getting any sunlight or anything.

1206
01:23:27,307 --> 01:23:32,569
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in good condition, I'm sure, but it's not that I'm in the buying and selling business of Pez dispensers.

1207
01:23:34,465 --> 01:23:39,188
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to be one of those dudes on the Food Network during Unwrapped or something.

1208
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:45,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched one last night and they were talking about some guy that collected Mr. Peanut stuff and he doesn't even like peanuts.

1209
01:23:45,673 --> 01:23:49,196
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a douchebag that collects Mr. Peanut crap.

1210
01:23:49,396 --> 01:23:50,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, really?

1211
01:23:52,136 --> 01:23:53,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1212
01:24:09,389 --> 01:24:31,950
[SPEAKER_05]: so whatever anyway I don't know how we got from video games to Hello Kitty but we can go back to talking about used games a little bit you know what's interesting is that Toys R Us is kind of in cahoots with Amazon so to kind of hear this you know because if you go to Amazon.com their toy section is all Toys R Us well Amazon.com is also running a trade-in program which would make sense if Toys R Us is doing this because they kind of have a little working agreement or whatever's going on

1213
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:35,132
[SPEAKER_05]: What you do, you can actually trade in games.

1214
01:24:35,152 --> 01:24:36,834
[SPEAKER_05]: You select games on their website apparently.

1215
01:24:36,854 --> 01:24:38,255
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be in good condition.

1216
01:24:38,575 --> 01:24:40,197
[SPEAKER_05]: You send in a shipment or whatever.

1217
01:24:40,437 --> 01:24:44,260
[SPEAKER_05]: You print a shipping label on your computer and you can actually send these games in.

1218
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:50,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And they will actually send you an Amazon.com gift card for however much the games were worth.

1219
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:51,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is kind of interesting.

1220
01:24:52,927 --> 01:24:55,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is something apparently I think is just being tested right now.

1221
01:24:55,569 --> 01:24:57,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's actually starting just yet.

1222
01:24:57,831 --> 01:24:58,892
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

1223
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:00,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1224
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:24,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1225
01:25:46,588 --> 01:25:47,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, and they also sell books.

1226
01:25:48,809 --> 01:25:51,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in chat, chat.orangelaundryday.com says, Rob sounds excited.

1227
01:25:52,011 --> 01:25:52,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1228
01:25:52,652 --> 01:25:53,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

1229
01:25:53,352 --> 01:25:55,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really, I don't ever sell games back.

1230
01:25:55,433 --> 01:25:56,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably should.

1231
01:25:56,754 --> 01:25:57,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot.

1232
01:25:57,494 --> 01:25:59,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of which, I brought back your Test Drive Unlimited.

1233
01:25:59,876 --> 01:26:02,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I realized I had it sitting on my shelf collecting dust.

1234
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:03,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea you even had it.

1235
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:04,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's...

1236
01:26:04,338 --> 01:26:08,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, I'll plug that in and try it this week or something, but yeah, I don't know.

1237
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:13,705
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTatooine in chat says, Sky, really, the only thing GameStop has over these is when you trade in a game, you can get a new one right away.

1238
01:26:14,145 --> 01:26:18,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazon, you'll have to wait for shipping, and that is a good counterpoint, because yeah, I don't like to wait for shipping and all this stuff.

1239
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:21,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even like Netflix, because it's too slow.

1240
01:26:22,871 --> 01:26:24,672
[SPEAKER_05]: When I want to watch a movie, I want to watch it now.

1241
01:26:24,872 --> 01:26:29,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's why, so I like Netflix Instant Queues, but let's face it, not everything is available on the Instant Queue.

1242
01:26:30,056 --> 01:26:30,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1243
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:35,912
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S in chat says, now at GameStop you get the same amount if it's cash or credit.

1244
01:26:36,012 --> 01:26:36,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That must be a new thing.

1245
01:26:37,855 --> 01:26:39,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that.

1246
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:40,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a promotion or something they're running right now.

1247
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:42,381
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't used to be that way.

1248
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:47,087
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems kind of fishy because I'd be getting cash every time.

1249
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:49,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Why now do you think that they're getting into this?

1250
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's just the state of the economy?

1251
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:55,674
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more of a demand for used games because $60 is a really high price point to get games?

1252
01:26:56,014 --> 01:26:56,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1253
01:26:56,614 --> 01:26:59,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably it's a big margin item.

1254
01:26:59,276 --> 01:27:02,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a business that has a good margin on it.

1255
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:04,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not try to get into it?

1256
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:10,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because Amazon's a powerful name and online merchants and...

1257
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:15,904
[SPEAKER_04]: If they can put together a really valuable system that people want to check out.

1258
01:27:16,104 --> 01:27:23,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember reading the trading values for some of these games, and they were a few bucks higher than GameStop, but you've got to wait a little bit longer.

1259
01:27:24,329 --> 01:27:24,549
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

1260
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:29,693
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to go that route, I guess you could, if you're kind of patient.

1261
01:27:29,933 --> 01:27:32,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I might look up some of my games and see if they're worth anything in the background.

1262
01:27:33,035 --> 01:27:34,356
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1263
01:28:00,057 --> 01:28:04,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we do, but we just sell back the newer crap, like sports games and shit.

1264
01:28:04,818 --> 01:28:05,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

1265
01:28:05,638 --> 01:28:07,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know, is this something that interests you at all?

1266
01:28:07,578 --> 01:28:11,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, let's assume hypothetically your husband didn't manage direct competition of this whole thing.

1267
01:28:11,999 --> 01:28:14,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this Amazon.com thing is something that would be interesting?

1268
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

1269
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:17,960
[SPEAKER_08]: He works at a video game store.

1270
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:22,721
[SPEAKER_08]: We just take them back to his store and trade them in for games at his store.

1271
01:28:23,081 --> 01:28:27,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but let's say hypothetically he didn't have that, because not everybody has a husband that does that.

1272
01:28:27,482 --> 01:28:27,642
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

1273
01:28:28,482 --> 01:28:28,722
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1274
01:28:29,698 --> 01:28:32,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more you want to add to this, DarkSakura?

1275
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:34,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Good idea in theory.

1276
01:28:34,961 --> 01:28:48,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Chegg.com started the trend actually for doing it online for having school books that you could rent and then trade in your old school books online to them and then get credit for stuff for your next semester's school books.

1277
01:28:48,996 --> 01:28:49,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1278
01:29:09,545 --> 01:29:24,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in other news, speaking of GameStop, they've actually dropped 13% in their stock value ever since Amazon announced their little trade-in deal.

1279
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:37,023
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually ended the day on Thursday trading in at $3.54, lower than it had before.

1280
01:29:38,645 --> 01:29:46,672
[SPEAKER_08]: So it looks like their investors are actually getting kind of worried about Amazon's little plan, even though GameStop themselves aren't.

1281
01:29:47,393 --> 01:29:51,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And looking at this, it's a fairly significant drop from what it was.

1282
01:29:52,257 --> 01:29:52,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1283
01:29:59,108 --> 01:30:06,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamefly Gamefly is testing out this brand new kiosk called the G-Box.

1284
01:30:06,796 --> 01:30:13,403
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game rental kiosk that I believe is going to be spotted at Texas Tech University.

1285
01:30:13,983 --> 01:30:16,065
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably going to be launching this soon.

1286
01:30:17,113 --> 01:30:19,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably on a limited basis right now to check it out.

1287
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:32,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It will allow you to rent games for $2.49 a day for Xbox 360 and PS3 and $1.99 a day for Wii.

1288
01:30:33,025 --> 01:30:37,308
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have new titles and they're going to carry them for a short period of time.

1289
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,352
[SPEAKER_04]: No word yet if this is going to tie into...

1290
01:30:44,193 --> 01:30:45,433
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

1291
01:31:09,741 --> 01:31:10,221
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1292
01:31:30,367 --> 01:31:49,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it could be interesting, which is weird, because I always thought those kiosks were kind of dumb, the ones I see at Walmart and stuff with the DVDs, but I have Netflix, I have Instant Netflix, I have other ways to access movies, but then I think about this whole concept for games, and I'm kind of like, well, you know, if Walmart right by my house had a box like this, I might be tempted to rent games, rather than just...

1293
01:31:51,147 --> 01:31:52,127
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1294
01:32:08,453 --> 01:32:12,657
[SPEAKER_04]: For a longer period of time, obviously, but if you want to do it by night, it's all about convenience.

1295
01:32:12,677 --> 01:32:17,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Because once something like this takes off, then you're going to see a lot more of these people doing it.

1296
01:32:17,761 --> 01:32:22,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bet you anything, if Gamefly has good success with this, you'll probably see Redbox doing it.

1297
01:32:22,926 --> 01:32:26,469
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll probably just have some sort of hybrid kiosk where you can rent games and movies.

1298
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:32,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And trust me, companies like that have thought about doing it, and they've tested it in some markets.

1299
01:32:33,396 --> 01:32:34,396
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem is, though, is...

1300
01:32:35,017 --> 01:32:35,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1301
01:32:53,550 --> 01:32:54,691
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1302
01:33:15,124 --> 01:33:19,926
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically Netflix, but it's Blockbuster stuff, and you can trade in the store.

1303
01:33:20,026 --> 01:33:22,027
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way they get around the whole shipping thing.

1304
01:33:22,287 --> 01:33:25,169
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't want to wait for shipping, you can trade in the store, which I think is really cool.

1305
01:33:25,569 --> 01:33:30,511
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing that Netflix has on them is that Netflix has the streaming, and Blockbuster doesn't.

1306
01:33:30,871 --> 01:33:36,234
[SPEAKER_05]: If Blockbuster teamed up with PS3 or something, I would leave Netflix and go to Blockbuster.

1307
01:33:36,354 --> 01:33:39,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that was one of the rumors floating around.

1308
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:39,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1309
01:33:41,036 --> 01:33:42,056
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty big.

1310
01:33:42,256 --> 01:33:43,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing, I mean...

1311
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:44,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1312
01:33:59,815 --> 01:34:00,275
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1313
01:34:16,305 --> 01:34:25,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, if we're sitting here, Loki and I, talking about, you know, maybe we'll stop making these $60 impulse buys if we could just rent the game for $2.50 out of one of these kiosks.

1314
01:34:25,991 --> 01:34:31,455
[SPEAKER_05]: In the long run, is this going to be a good thing for the gaming industry, or is this setting up the gaming industry to get shot in the foot?

1315
01:34:32,217 --> 01:34:34,498
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1316
01:34:49,764 --> 01:34:57,491
[SPEAKER_04]: However, though, on, you know, kind of the DVD movie side, not everyone is on board with the whole kiosk things.

1317
01:34:57,571 --> 01:35:04,577
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, there's a deal going on right now with Universal where all their product is basically banned from Redbox kiosks.

1318
01:35:04,617 --> 01:35:09,501
[SPEAKER_04]: They will not sell to Redbox, and they will fine anybody that sells to them.

1319
01:35:09,801 --> 01:35:12,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, you know, ruining sort of deals that have gone on.

1320
01:35:13,044 --> 01:35:13,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1321
01:35:13,985 --> 01:35:21,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Redbox, the people that run those, have to go out and actually purchase movies from a big box retailer and then put them in their kiosk.

1322
01:35:22,171 --> 01:35:23,531
[SPEAKER_04]: But they can't purchase them directly.

1323
01:35:23,872 --> 01:35:31,056
[SPEAKER_04]: They think that it's affecting their sell-through business by having these Redbox kiosks.

1324
01:35:31,877 --> 01:35:34,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, when you look at the facts, though, that's not really the case.

1325
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:37,381
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really having a large impact on it, but

1326
01:35:38,462 --> 01:35:39,444
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

1327
01:35:53,322 --> 01:35:53,843
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1328
01:36:12,034 --> 01:36:14,315
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's look at other great comments from chat.

1329
01:36:14,335 --> 01:36:14,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, chatters.

1330
01:36:14,975 --> 01:36:21,176
[SPEAKER_05]: BreastLol, no, this was the same thing as blockbuster-ready games that Nintendo got all pissy back in the late 80s, early 90s.

1331
01:36:21,856 --> 01:36:26,637
[SPEAKER_05]: AcidicVampire, it's a great thing because people will still buy the game if they like it, especially gamers.

1332
01:36:27,197 --> 01:36:31,838
[SPEAKER_05]: DJRamaS, this could force the gaming industry to lower the price of the PlayStation 3 360 games.

1333
01:36:32,338 --> 01:36:35,339
[SPEAKER_05]: ActDeft, sounds interesting, but I really don't know if it'll work or not.

1334
01:36:35,879 --> 01:36:39,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Xlink, it can be a pro because you can try to see if you want to buy the game.

1335
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:40,281
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStop doing rentals.

1336
01:36:40,341 --> 01:36:41,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet.

1337
01:36:53,755 --> 01:36:56,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Son of Dad, it might bring down game prices for retail as a whole.

1338
01:36:57,058 --> 01:36:59,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I would buy a used game from a Redbox for $25 if it was available.

1339
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:06,565
[SPEAKER_05]: SuperDude in chat says, wouldn't it be great if you could just stream new releases games like you do with Netflix on Xbox Live?

1340
01:37:07,106 --> 01:37:08,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you something like that is coming.

1341
01:37:08,947 --> 01:37:15,252
[SPEAKER_05]: There's those rumors going around that the PSP 2, or whatever they're going to call it, new PSP, is going to not have a UMD slot.

1342
01:37:15,272 --> 01:37:16,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we had a story on that a couple weeks ago.

1343
01:37:17,514 --> 01:37:19,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine if you could only download games.

1344
01:37:20,276 --> 01:37:21,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't use my UMD slot.

1345
01:37:23,818 --> 01:37:25,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little different for you, but you know what I'm saying.

1346
01:37:26,559 --> 01:37:29,861
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of are seeing this shift towards digital distribution.

1347
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:46,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember, we've been doing this show long enough now, I seem to remember in the last generation when the PS2 was new and all this stuff was new when we first started our show, there was talk that this round of systems we're in now was going to be all digital distribution.

1348
01:37:46,566 --> 01:37:51,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly with things like Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, there's a gigantic foot in the door

1349
01:37:52,697 --> 01:37:53,078
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

1350
01:38:09,276 --> 01:38:16,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think maybe something like that is coming where you could stream games like that, but I don't think it's going to be the retail games.

1351
01:38:16,282 --> 01:38:23,289
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a long time before you see the retail games buy into that, but certainly digital distribution has...

1352
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:25,071
[SPEAKER_04]: games all its own.

1353
01:38:25,171 --> 01:38:26,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony's on board with it.

1354
01:38:26,152 --> 01:38:32,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're doing their first party games available for PSP as digital downloads at the same time as release.

1355
01:38:33,478 --> 01:38:41,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've kind of tested the waters a little bit with Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Warhawk, Burnout Paradise.

1356
01:38:42,526 --> 01:38:44,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if they can find a way that

1357
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:46,110
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1358
01:39:02,105 --> 01:39:07,431
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to move on to another story, but if you want to give your comments on this, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1359
01:39:07,451 --> 01:39:08,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us an email.

1360
01:39:08,091 --> 01:39:11,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially, I really want to hear from, and I know we have a few that listen to this show.

1361
01:39:12,176 --> 01:39:14,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear from the people that work for the developers and publishers.

1362
01:39:14,498 --> 01:39:15,940
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about these boxes?

1363
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:17,621
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you see as the impact to your business?

1364
01:39:17,741 --> 01:39:18,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to kind of hear from those guys.

1365
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:21,666
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need to stay anonymous for whatever reason, then put it in your email.

1366
01:39:21,686 --> 01:39:22,747
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be happy to stay anonymous.

1367
01:39:22,787 --> 01:39:23,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, Dark Sakura?

1368
01:39:23,588 --> 01:39:23,948
[SPEAKER_05]: You would be.

1369
01:39:24,088 --> 01:39:24,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Just say it right up front.

1370
01:39:25,069 --> 01:39:32,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, so, and yeah, because I would really like to hear from that side of things because I don't think we have anybody working or in the chat tonight.

1371
01:39:33,471 --> 01:39:37,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on and talk about maybe games that you might rent through these kiosks someday.

1372
01:39:38,132 --> 01:39:41,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Arc System Works, they are the folks that put together Guilty Gear.

1373
01:39:41,613 --> 01:39:44,454
[SPEAKER_05]: They are doing a new high-def 2D fighter.

1374
01:39:44,494 --> 01:39:46,774
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is called BlazBlue or BlazBlue.

1375
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:50,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how exactly you pronounce that because there's no E. It's BlazBlue, I would imagine.

1376
01:39:50,575 --> 01:39:51,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360 and PS3 Story Mode

1377
01:40:07,106 --> 01:40:09,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Some individual stories for each characters and so on.

1378
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:13,213
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 hours of gameplay, according to the director, Toshimichi Mori.

1379
01:40:14,234 --> 01:40:25,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there's going to be, of course, online support, which you can expect in this current generation of games, and download content as well, although they haven't said, is that just going to be outfits, new characters, moves, backgrounds, whatever.

1380
01:40:27,509 --> 01:40:28,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1381
01:40:52,257 --> 01:40:54,961
[SPEAKER_05]: ShadowCharlie in chat says, yeah, I played BlazBlue in Chinatown.

1382
01:40:54,981 --> 01:40:55,422
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you think?

1383
01:40:55,802 --> 01:40:56,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious.

1384
01:40:56,163 --> 01:40:59,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I had not heard of this game before tonight, seeing that news bit.

1385
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:01,030
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed it off a while ago.

1386
01:41:01,691 --> 01:41:02,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty sweet.

1387
01:41:02,972 --> 01:41:05,976
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all hand-drawn, 100,000 animations per character.

1388
01:41:08,302 --> 01:41:09,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Shadow Street Fighter IV

1389
01:41:26,448 --> 01:41:27,128
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1390
01:41:48,076 --> 01:41:48,596
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 years, maybe?

1391
01:41:48,616 --> 01:41:58,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's actually the first HD version that's going to be from SNK Playmore.

1392
01:41:58,064 --> 01:42:00,766
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1393
01:42:01,347 --> 01:42:08,753
[SPEAKER_08]: It has 20 playable characters, and they're all freshly redrawn, and the backgrounds are all new and pretty.

1394
01:42:09,693 --> 01:42:13,757
[SPEAKER_08]: and, uh, supposed to really kick a bunch of ass.

1395
01:42:14,137 --> 01:42:22,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's supposed to be, um, preview footage and images, um, included with the PS2 release of, uh, King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match.

1396
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:25,005
[SPEAKER_08]: So, let us know if you see him.

1397
01:42:26,586 --> 01:42:27,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Mai's in it, right?

1398
01:42:27,347 --> 01:42:28,008
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I want to know.

1399
01:42:28,048 --> 01:42:29,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, of course, her and her boobs.

1400
01:42:30,349 --> 01:42:30,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right.

1401
01:42:30,990 --> 01:42:31,350
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1402
01:42:31,370 --> 01:42:31,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Me bouncy.

1403
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:33,646
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I need.

1404
01:42:59,031 --> 01:43:12,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Program or update to their program that bypasses the anti-piracy features in a lot of these games and apparently now works on all the current games that feature some sort of anti-piracy lockout.

1405
01:43:15,697 --> 01:43:17,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's no way to spin that.

1406
01:43:17,178 --> 01:43:18,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That's only for piracy.

1407
01:43:18,758 --> 01:43:25,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess if you're interested in pirating games, the Cyclo DS is the way to go for now.

1408
01:43:26,761 --> 01:43:28,122
[SPEAKER_04]: But interesting though.

1409
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:32,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something we should really be encouraging?

1410
01:43:34,169 --> 01:43:34,329
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1411
01:43:34,890 --> 01:43:44,135
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's one of those things that, you know, and one reason I like to report on this on the show, as I know we all do, is, you know, it's out there, so you can't deny its existence.

1412
01:43:44,475 --> 01:43:51,179
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of interesting to see what that scene does to always compensate for what the developers of the systems do and back and forth.

1413
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:51,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1414
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:54,121
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1415
01:43:56,007 --> 01:43:59,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Talkin' a little bit about Metal Gear Online.

1416
01:43:59,389 --> 01:44:00,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of movin' over a little bit.

1417
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:02,952
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a new expansion coming out on St.

1418
01:44:02,972 --> 01:44:04,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick's Day, March 17th.

1419
01:44:04,493 --> 01:44:06,995
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Metal Gear Online Scene Expansion.

1420
01:44:07,515 --> 01:44:09,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Three brand new maps coming to the game.

1421
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:12,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Two new characters are gonna be coming as well.

1422
01:44:12,858 --> 01:44:16,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Raiden and Vamp, apparently, are the new characters that you're gonna see in the Metal Gear Online.

1423
01:44:17,362 --> 01:44:25,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Also some new special gear, which I think is kind of funny because now you can apparently wear a bikini if you want, or you can dress yourself up in clown face or whatever.

1424
01:44:25,547 --> 01:44:29,129
[SPEAKER_05]: or you can wear the head of Robbie the Rabbit if you want to be extra creepy.

1425
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:30,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be from Silent Hill.

1426
01:44:30,851 --> 01:44:31,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1427
01:44:31,531 --> 01:44:33,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you just want to encourage people to shoot you, I don't know.

1428
01:44:34,633 --> 01:44:37,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there's going to be a brand new game type introduced to Metal Gear Online.

1429
01:44:38,396 --> 01:44:40,837
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free if you get the pack or not.

1430
01:44:41,197 --> 01:44:42,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Solo Capture.

1431
01:44:42,678 --> 01:44:47,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like Team Capture, but you're by yourself because it's Solo Capture.

1432
01:44:47,742 --> 01:44:53,105
[SPEAKER_05]: This expansion will cost you $9.99 if you want to get all the costumes and the characters and all that stuff.

1433
01:44:54,186 --> 01:44:54,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1434
01:44:55,466 --> 01:44:59,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-order start on the 10th and there's some screenshots floating around the internet there.

1435
01:45:00,308 --> 01:45:06,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other items, you can get a visor for write-in and some special actions, etc.

1436
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:13,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know anyone that plays Metal Gear Online, but I bet it has a pretty rabid community because I can't think of many games like it.

1437
01:45:15,292 --> 01:45:16,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

1438
01:45:17,672 --> 01:45:19,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1439
01:45:20,256 --> 01:45:21,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Cat Toys Controllers

1440
01:45:40,606 --> 01:45:43,508
[SPEAKER_08]: They have one that's a Guitar Hero controller.

1441
01:45:44,209 --> 01:45:51,355
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a Wiimote, a Game Boy, an old school Game Boy, like the brick.

1442
01:45:51,995 --> 01:45:56,699
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a 360 controller and a NES controller.

1443
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:01,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And they look like they're made out of felt and they are for the kitties.

1444
01:46:01,823 --> 01:46:03,024
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so cute.

1445
01:46:03,044 --> 01:46:07,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, and above all, they're just cute, adorable for the little kitties.

1446
01:46:07,468 --> 01:46:09,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to show this picture to the chat room.

1447
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:11,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Might Shermie be getting one of these?

1448
01:46:11,714 --> 01:46:11,894
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1449
01:46:11,914 --> 01:46:14,356
[SPEAKER_08]: She don't play with any of the shit I buy her.

1450
01:46:14,397 --> 01:46:14,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Grinch.

1451
01:46:15,017 --> 01:46:15,938
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what she plays with?

1452
01:46:16,158 --> 01:46:16,358
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1453
01:46:16,839 --> 01:46:17,980
[SPEAKER_08]: She plays with twist ties.

1454
01:46:19,942 --> 01:46:20,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1455
01:46:20,943 --> 01:46:21,964
[SPEAKER_05]: How about your kitty, Loki?

1456
01:46:22,044 --> 01:46:23,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you got a kitty a couple years ago.

1457
01:46:23,786 --> 01:46:24,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something?

1458
01:46:24,727 --> 01:46:26,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that my cat would play with?

1459
01:46:26,288 --> 01:46:29,131
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she'd probably look at it and go, I don't think so.

1460
01:46:29,932 --> 01:46:31,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Does she still play with that stick?

1461
01:46:33,914 --> 01:46:35,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like the feather and stuff?

1462
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she loves the feather.

1463
01:46:36,816 --> 01:46:44,183
[SPEAKER_04]: No, her thing right now, what she's been doing, she likes it when we make her tents or little forts on the couch.

1464
01:46:44,223 --> 01:46:50,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time we go to bed now, we build her a fort using the blankets on the couch, and she loves that.

1465
01:46:50,808 --> 01:46:55,572
[SPEAKER_04]: She's really easy to entertain.

1466
01:46:55,672 --> 01:46:59,415
[SPEAKER_04]: She likes the milk rings, the little rings on the milk cartons.

1467
01:47:00,336 --> 01:47:03,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she has like 90 of them in the house.

1468
01:47:03,537 --> 01:47:06,238
[SPEAKER_04]: She dumps them all in her food and water for some reason.

1469
01:47:06,298 --> 01:47:07,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure why.

1470
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:09,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I don't know.

1471
01:47:10,519 --> 01:47:11,399
[SPEAKER_08]: She's making tea.

1472
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:13,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Making plastic tea.

1473
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:14,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

1474
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:17,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I always say Shermie puts her food in her water bowl because she wants tea.

1475
01:47:17,942 --> 01:47:18,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a kitty.

1476
01:47:19,042 --> 01:47:21,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any cute kitty stories like you guys do.

1477
01:47:21,283 --> 01:47:22,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a kitty.

1478
01:47:22,543 --> 01:47:24,804
[SPEAKER_05]: The roommate doesn't want a kitty though, so I'll have to wait.

1479
01:47:25,044 --> 01:47:25,844
[SPEAKER_05]: But, someday.

1480
01:47:27,688 --> 01:47:28,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

1481
01:47:29,388 --> 01:47:40,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, not necessarily something for a cat, but the PlayStation Network, Sony is, I guess, trying to make this more like the virtual console.

1482
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:51,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the rumor is, I guess, that they're going to try to put more non-PS1 titles on the PlayStation Network.

1483
01:47:52,114 --> 01:47:53,295
[SPEAKER_04]: No word on exactly...

1484
01:47:55,239 --> 01:47:57,001
[SPEAKER_04]: What systems are you talking about?

1485
01:47:57,421 --> 01:47:58,782
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be arcade games.

1486
01:47:58,942 --> 01:47:59,363
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be.

1487
01:47:59,383 --> 01:48:00,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Just through process of elimination.

1488
01:48:00,584 --> 01:48:02,245
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't put Nintendo games on there.

1489
01:48:02,886 --> 01:48:06,189
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be pointless to then put Sega games on there now that they have that collection out.

1490
01:48:06,669 --> 01:48:11,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they could strike a deal for TurboGrafx games or something, but I'm thinking arcade games.

1491
01:48:11,093 --> 01:48:13,475
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Mortal Kombat 2 on PlayStation Network, right?

1492
01:48:13,956 --> 01:48:15,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm thinking arcade games.

1493
01:48:16,311 --> 01:48:24,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, basically they're promising more PS1 titles and also more pre-PS1 retro titles.

1494
01:48:24,755 --> 01:48:26,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm guessing those will be the arcade games.

1495
01:48:27,036 --> 01:48:28,116
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really play...

1496
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:33,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Games like Mortal Kombat over the PSP thing, right?

1497
01:48:33,273 --> 01:48:38,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember Mortal Kombat 2 was one of the first games that came out on PlayStation Network, but you can play it on PS3, but you can't play that on PSP, can you?

1498
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:40,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have that whole functionality, does it?

1499
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:44,204
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't play multiplayer over Wi-Fi or anything like that.

1500
01:48:44,284 --> 01:48:48,027
[SPEAKER_04]: The emulator that it uses to run those doesn't work that way.

1501
01:48:48,167 --> 01:48:49,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you even download it to the...

1502
01:48:50,089 --> 01:48:54,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, any PlayStation 1 games that are on the PS3 can be played on the PSP.

1503
01:48:54,153 --> 01:48:55,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Mortal Kombat 2 counts, though.

1504
01:48:55,835 --> 01:48:58,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking specifically that one, because it wasn't a PlayStation 1 port.

1505
01:48:58,598 --> 01:49:02,842
[SPEAKER_04]: That might have been an Xbox, or not an Xbox, like a PlayStation Network game.

1506
01:49:03,022 --> 01:49:03,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it was.

1507
01:49:04,464 --> 01:49:08,307
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's a PS1 classic title, then yes, that can be ported over.

1508
01:49:08,468 --> 01:49:10,149
[SPEAKER_05]: If I would get a memory card for my PSP.

1509
01:49:10,510 --> 01:49:11,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I could play Suikoden on the go.

1510
01:49:12,492 --> 01:49:12,952
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyhow...

1511
01:49:14,773 --> 01:49:17,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Jail Adults Who Allow Their Kids To Play Video Games That Are Violent

1512
01:49:39,901 --> 01:49:44,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is according to Chief Censor Bill Hastings from New Zealand.

1513
01:49:44,782 --> 01:49:47,263
[SPEAKER_05]: They might think the offense is silly, but it ain't.

1514
01:49:48,203 --> 01:50:01,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, if you were to, let's say, let your kid play a violent video game, you know, shoot him up, blow some hookers in Grand Theft Auto, whatever, apparently, if you were the parent and you let your kid play this game, you could face up to three months in prison or a $10,000 fine.

1515
01:50:02,247 --> 01:50:04,908
[SPEAKER_05]: This law is set up to send a message.

1516
01:50:07,109 --> 01:50:07,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1517
01:50:08,388 --> 01:50:10,609
[SPEAKER_08]: How about just let people raise their children?

1518
01:50:11,029 --> 01:50:11,629
[SPEAKER_05]: The way they want?

1519
01:50:11,949 --> 01:50:15,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I read something like that, I'm like, a big brother is watching you.

1520
01:50:15,309 --> 01:50:16,270
[SPEAKER_05]: How are they going to catch you?

1521
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:20,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to be watching me in my house or rely on people tattling on other people?

1522
01:50:20,730 --> 01:50:21,751
[SPEAKER_05]: This doesn't make sense at all.

1523
01:50:21,931 --> 01:50:24,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan and I had a conversation about this earlier today, actually.

1524
01:50:24,511 --> 01:50:24,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1525
01:50:25,031 --> 01:50:33,393
[SPEAKER_08]: That we actually wouldn't mind if our kids played violent games as long as we balanced it and had talks to them and everything.

1526
01:50:34,153 --> 01:50:38,456
[SPEAKER_08]: GS68 in chat says, Parents, not government, should be in charge of what their kids play.

1527
01:50:38,476 --> 01:50:40,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a very well-rounded statement.

1528
01:50:41,337 --> 01:50:41,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1529
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:59,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting, though.

1530
01:50:59,261 --> 01:51:01,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So you would probably let your kids play violent video games.

1531
01:51:02,061 --> 01:51:02,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1532
01:51:02,482 --> 01:51:03,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd probably play it with them.

1533
01:51:04,242 --> 01:51:04,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no.

1534
01:51:05,002 --> 01:51:06,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I would play it with them.

1535
01:51:07,223 --> 01:51:08,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1536
01:51:08,103 --> 01:51:10,524
[SPEAKER_05]: In the right context, I think it would be all right.

1537
01:51:10,544 --> 01:51:14,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think about myself because maybe someday I'll have a kid somehow or whatever.

1538
01:51:15,025 --> 01:51:21,387
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if – part of me says if you don't let them play it, they're going to find a way to do it.

1539
01:51:21,507 --> 01:51:21,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're right.

1540
01:51:21,988 --> 01:51:26,849
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not the one playing it with them, then they might not get it in the right context, if that makes sense.

1541
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:39,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, on top of that, and this goes true for just about anybody, child, adult, whatever, the things that people are not allowed to do tend to be the things that they want to do just because they're not allowed to.

1542
01:51:39,515 --> 01:51:40,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know what I mean?

1543
01:51:42,259 --> 01:51:43,280
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1544
01:52:03,357 --> 01:52:09,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, the same sort of logic applies to just about anything that people are told they can't do.

1545
01:52:09,742 --> 01:52:15,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, okay, for example, let's actually use the recent Prop 8 crap.

1546
01:52:16,327 --> 01:52:17,788
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people are told they can't do something.

1547
01:52:17,828 --> 01:52:18,248
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens?

1548
01:52:18,269 --> 01:52:20,050
[SPEAKER_08]: People come out and force and protest it, right?

1549
01:52:21,722 --> 01:52:26,787
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and people, you know, they get it done while they can or find other ways to get it done.

1550
01:52:26,827 --> 01:52:29,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's what I'm saying is that it's there, you know what I mean?

1551
01:52:30,671 --> 01:52:34,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever someone says you can't do something, spite is a very big part of human nature.

1552
01:52:35,075 --> 01:52:40,500
[SPEAKER_08]: That indignation that someone has the audacity to tell you you can't do something, you know?

1553
01:52:40,961 --> 01:52:42,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever since we're little kids, don't you agree, Rob?

1554
01:52:43,365 --> 01:52:51,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, and it's funny because sometimes for laughs I'll go read, specifically you're talking about Prop 8, which obviously is an issue I'm quite passionate about.

1555
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:53,371
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know why, you need to listen to the show more.

1556
01:52:53,891 --> 01:52:58,754
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing, I'll sometimes follow it on one of the local news sites where people can comment on it.

1557
01:52:58,774 --> 01:53:02,156
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of comments I see are, you guys report on this issue too much.

1558
01:53:02,196 --> 01:53:04,617
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like every day you're reporting on some protest.

1559
01:53:05,158 --> 01:53:07,379
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because people are not going to shut up.

1560
01:53:07,919 --> 01:53:08,480
[SPEAKER_05]: My point was...

1561
01:53:18,453 --> 01:53:19,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I'm sorry, I got on a tangent.

1562
01:53:20,034 --> 01:53:28,542
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, that actually has to go with what I was saying is that you tell people they can't do something and that's going to rise up indignation.

1563
01:53:28,602 --> 01:53:31,044
[SPEAKER_08]: People don't want to be controlled.

1564
01:53:31,104 --> 01:53:34,246
[SPEAKER_08]: People don't want to be told no.

1565
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:45,075
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why I'm comparing something as strong as a civil rights movement to something as arbitrary as food is that it all comes from the same...

1566
01:53:46,136 --> 01:53:47,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now food is a necessity.

1567
01:53:58,288 --> 01:53:59,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be gay, Sparky.

1568
01:53:59,148 --> 01:53:59,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be gay.

1569
01:54:17,768 --> 01:54:24,473
[SPEAKER_08]: or, you know, why do you think little kids think it's so awesome to go and sneak around and do stuff behind their parents' back?

1570
01:54:25,214 --> 01:54:27,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they know their parents are going to make a big deal out of it.

1571
01:54:27,576 --> 01:54:28,897
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of its attention, too.

1572
01:54:29,577 --> 01:54:37,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, why is it that people get, you know, let's rate this very R, why do people get turned on doing it in places that they know they're not supposed to?

1573
01:54:38,507 --> 01:54:42,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, like the couple who was doing the... Whoa!

1574
01:54:43,329 --> 01:54:49,771
[SPEAKER_08]: No, for real, there was a contest that was going around about, you know, who could do it in what area, and there were like points you'd get for touching.

1575
01:54:49,871 --> 01:54:51,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wasn't that a big radio contest?

1576
01:54:51,612 --> 01:54:51,872
[SPEAKER_05]: It was.

1577
01:54:51,992 --> 01:54:54,373
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the Opie and Anthony thing that got them kicked off the air, right?

1578
01:54:54,413 --> 01:54:56,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Where they had sex in a church or something?

1579
01:54:56,174 --> 01:54:57,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

1580
01:54:57,114 --> 01:55:00,235
[SPEAKER_08]: But why would it be such a big deal if they weren't allowed to do it?

1581
01:55:00,255 --> 01:55:02,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're not supposed to have sex in a house of God.

1582
01:55:02,296 --> 01:55:02,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1583
01:55:04,117 --> 01:55:06,998
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're yelling, oh God, oh God, that's not praying.

1584
01:55:07,882 --> 01:55:15,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So, really, where would the allure be of a kid sneaking around behind his parents' back if there's no harm in it?

1585
01:55:15,705 --> 01:55:18,666
[SPEAKER_08]: If the parents are going to be like, okay.

1586
01:55:20,327 --> 01:55:21,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you see what my logic is?

1587
01:55:21,468 --> 01:55:22,508
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I get it.

1588
01:55:22,568 --> 01:55:24,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be like that with my kid.

1589
01:55:24,069 --> 01:55:29,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's not that I'm going to, you know, I'm going to teach them the right and wrong, but video games are video games.

1590
01:55:30,231 --> 01:55:35,293
[SPEAKER_08]: My whole plan is to teach them the difference between reality and unreality.

1591
01:55:35,913 --> 01:55:37,214
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also don't care if they curse.

1592
01:55:38,305 --> 01:55:42,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, obviously this is soliciting a huge response from chat.

1593
01:55:42,167 --> 01:55:44,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to read some of the chat comments we have here.

1594
01:55:45,749 --> 01:55:50,231
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru says, I'll allow my kid to play any game but have talks if it's rated for older people.

1595
01:55:51,271 --> 01:55:53,372
[SPEAKER_05]: SuperDude says, no flour for my kids.

1596
01:55:54,633 --> 01:55:57,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't play a game as tame as flour.

1597
01:55:57,955 --> 01:56:00,336
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, Jamie will teach your kids to play pinball.

1598
01:56:01,327 --> 01:56:02,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell fuck yeah!

1599
01:56:02,408 --> 01:56:04,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the lyrics to Pinball Wizard.

1600
01:56:04,731 --> 01:56:06,533
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I want to play good games with my kids.

1601
01:56:06,553 --> 01:56:09,997
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru says, Government is full of idiots and I don't want idiots to raise kids.

1602
01:56:24,612 --> 01:56:41,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Deekman has an interesting plan in chat chat.orangelunchradio.com live on Sunday night says when my girl gets older I plan on setting up an NES in her room and only letting her play NES games for two months then SNES for two months and so on so she gets an appreciation for classics

1603
01:56:45,008 --> 01:56:49,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I also have this expectation that my child will be like me and my husband were and not be stupid.

1604
01:56:51,051 --> 01:56:54,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I watched all kinds of crap and played all kinds of crap.

1605
01:56:54,552 --> 01:57:01,154
[SPEAKER_08]: And as long as the difference was... I don't think a five-year-old should play Silent Hill.

1606
01:57:02,195 --> 01:57:02,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1607
01:57:02,995 --> 01:57:06,937
[SPEAKER_08]: But what five-year-old is going to be interested in Silent Hill?

1608
01:57:07,217 --> 01:57:07,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1609
01:57:08,709 --> 01:57:17,694
[SPEAKER_08]: But like, you know, when I was, for example, I don't look at it any different as me being allowed to read the books I was allowed to read as a child.

1610
01:57:18,475 --> 01:57:27,200
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the Scarlet Letter had to do with, you know, a woman conceiving an illegitimate child by having an affair.

1611
01:57:28,081 --> 01:57:29,422
[SPEAKER_08]: How old were we when we read this?

1612
01:57:30,712 --> 01:57:34,494
[SPEAKER_08]: How about the Grapes of Wrath dealing with the depression?

1613
01:57:34,514 --> 01:57:35,834
[SPEAKER_08]: That's certainly an adult theme.

1614
01:57:36,254 --> 01:57:40,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I read Atlas Shrugged when I was in 9th grade.

1615
01:57:40,596 --> 01:57:42,577
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually deals with a lot of sex.

1616
01:57:43,137 --> 01:57:47,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Catcher in the Rye is like the Quinta Shenshul sophomore year of high school book, right?

1617
01:57:48,119 --> 01:57:48,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I never read it.

1618
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:55,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I read the Odyssey when I was in middle school.

1619
01:57:55,152 --> 01:57:57,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I read the Inferno when I was in middle school.

1620
01:57:58,893 --> 01:58:03,475
[SPEAKER_08]: But I look at it, it's got to be down to the parent's judgment.

1621
01:58:03,975 --> 01:58:07,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I look at it the same way as, yeah, they're classic books, whatever people.

1622
01:58:08,317 --> 01:58:14,439
[SPEAKER_08]: But the situations dealt with are for a different level of intellect and maturity.

1623
01:58:15,359 --> 01:58:24,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly, if I don't detect the level of maturity that I think is going to be able to handle that, then I'm not going to be the one to introduce it to them.

1624
01:58:25,204 --> 01:58:25,704
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1625
01:58:26,825 --> 01:58:34,089
[SPEAKER_08]: If it comes out that, yeah, I was at my friend's house and I saw this thing, then I'll be like, okay, well, let's have a talk.

1626
01:58:34,189 --> 01:58:35,269
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's not real, right?

1627
01:58:35,429 --> 01:58:36,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, don't do that.

1628
01:58:37,507 --> 01:58:38,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get some chat comments.

1629
01:58:38,508 --> 01:58:39,349
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great discussion.

1630
01:58:39,550 --> 01:58:41,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Bress Lowell says, Jamie read Playboy too.

1631
01:58:41,532 --> 01:58:42,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that.

1632
01:58:42,473 --> 01:58:43,374
[SPEAKER_05]: For the articles though, right?

1633
01:58:43,954 --> 01:58:46,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Bochikawa in chat says, Catcher in the Rye is like 6th grade now.

1634
01:58:48,134 --> 01:58:48,934
[SPEAKER_05]: They grow up so fast.

1635
01:58:49,354 --> 01:58:53,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Shadow says, you know, with all these rainbows and unicorns, five-year-olds will really be into Diablo 3.

1636
01:58:54,536 --> 01:58:54,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.

1637
01:58:55,856 --> 01:58:57,576
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, some more serious comments in chat.

1638
01:58:58,857 --> 01:59:08,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Death Wishing says, I personally think it's good to show kids M-rated games because it shows like Grand Theft Auto because it shows them that if they do something wrong, they get fucked by the police.

1639
01:59:09,915 --> 01:59:10,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that.

1640
01:59:11,676 --> 01:59:16,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And what people are taking out of context is that... There was an XD after that, so I think there was a little tongue-in-cheek.

1641
01:59:16,219 --> 01:59:24,083
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also think that what some people are taking out of context is that I'm not going to take a five-year-old, like I said, and play Silent Hill with them.

1642
01:59:25,224 --> 01:59:27,906
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of it is parents' discretion.

1643
01:59:28,826 --> 01:59:34,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, like when my little sister... Okay, when my little sister was little, little...

1644
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:36,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1645
01:59:53,091 --> 01:59:55,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's, there's a difference.

1646
01:59:55,893 --> 02:00:01,216
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you just have to trust sometimes that the kids are smarter than you give them credit for.

1647
02:00:01,557 --> 02:00:11,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And I actually had this discussion with Dan's stepmother, and I'm not going to go into too detail, but I was like, we can't expect the government to do a parent's job for them.

1648
02:00:11,643 --> 02:00:16,646
[SPEAKER_08]: The parent's responsibility is to that child until they are of age and can leave.

1649
02:00:19,417 --> 02:00:22,061
[SPEAKER_08]: A person is a parent before conception.

1650
02:00:23,143 --> 02:00:23,944
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I see it.

1651
02:00:25,509 --> 02:00:28,470
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple last comments from chat here and then we'll try to go ahead and move on for tonight.

1652
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:31,590
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a good discussion and I'm sure we'll probably get some emails about this one.

1653
02:00:31,630 --> 02:00:31,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

1654
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:38,512
[SPEAKER_05]: SuperDude in chat says, If kids can get their hands into R-rated movies, it's not that hard for them to get the M-rated games either.

1655
02:00:38,632 --> 02:00:42,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Kids will always find a way to get the M-rated games because they know M-rated games are the shit.

1656
02:00:43,933 --> 02:00:49,354
[SPEAKER_05]: DeathWishing in chat, last comment here I'm going to read, I play video games and I haven't killed anything except ants.

1657
02:00:49,874 --> 02:00:50,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking ants.

1658
02:00:52,554 --> 02:00:54,756
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was 12 I found my mom's college level human sexuality book.

1659
02:00:54,876 --> 02:00:58,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Only damage it did was give me some very happy boyfriends later in life.

1660
02:01:16,621 --> 02:01:21,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look, we gotta make some time here since we did just read about a really ludicrous story.

1661
02:01:21,812 --> 02:01:27,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously these types of stories put us into a fit of rage and it's a part of the show that we like to call the FUs of the Week.

1662
02:01:42,671 --> 02:01:46,554
[SPEAKER_08]: My first FU goes to people making assumptions.

1663
02:01:48,475 --> 02:02:01,224
[SPEAKER_08]: This is directed towards certain people in my house who will not name names of.

1664
02:02:02,765 --> 02:02:08,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I'd actually have to direct that towards myself too because I've made a couple of assumptions too, so...

1665
02:02:09,189 --> 02:02:38,063
[SPEAKER_08]: my second I was about to say my second assumption I meant my second F you actually has to do with semis trying to do U-turns and intersections too small for them and my third one has to do with the Watchmen movie it should have been a fucking miniseries not a movie it's not means I didn't like it I just meant the story would have been better told through a miniseries you just wanted more of it

1666
02:02:39,446 --> 02:02:40,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted it better paced.

1667
02:02:41,988 --> 02:02:42,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put it that way.

1668
02:02:42,808 --> 02:02:43,909
[SPEAKER_08]: It needed better pacing.

1669
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:45,510
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1670
02:02:45,711 --> 02:02:47,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a lot of FUs.

1671
02:02:47,432 --> 02:02:51,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess FU to Daylight Savings Time because that really screwed up my weekend.

1672
02:02:51,655 --> 02:02:54,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, just an FU to the fact that I'm flying to Washington, D.C.

1673
02:02:54,957 --> 02:02:56,518
[SPEAKER_05]: this week and I'm only going to be there for a day.

1674
02:02:57,219 --> 02:02:58,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm flying there on Tuesday.

1675
02:02:58,580 --> 02:02:59,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be there Wednesday.

1676
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:00,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm flying back on Thursday.

1677
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:03,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So FU to not getting to spend quality time in a faraway town.

1678
02:03:03,823 --> 02:03:04,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1679
02:03:04,904 --> 02:03:07,406
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to Cobblestones because they suck to walk on.

1680
02:03:07,895 --> 02:03:09,456
[SPEAKER_04]: The Round and Awkward.

1681
02:03:09,476 --> 02:03:12,539
[SPEAKER_04]: The Round and Awkward.

1682
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:14,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

1683
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:16,162
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it for the FUs of the Week.

1684
02:03:17,083 --> 02:03:20,946
[SPEAKER_05]: A segment we've done for the past many, many years here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1685
02:03:20,966 --> 02:03:22,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back into some gaming news.

1686
02:03:22,488 --> 02:03:28,933
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have the mailbag coming up and the Skype line soon enough as well where we'll be taking your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR but not just yet.

1687
02:03:28,973 --> 02:03:30,294
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let you know when the phones are open.

1688
02:03:30,574 --> 02:03:32,896
[SPEAKER_05]: We do still have some more stories we want to get to though before then.

1689
02:03:32,956 --> 02:03:33,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, Jamie?

1690
02:03:33,677 --> 02:03:35,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and this one's about Penny Arcade.

1691
02:03:36,139 --> 02:03:45,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Washington State has passed a bill which is pretty much like damn you guys rock to the Penny Arcade founders Jerry Hulkins and Mike Krahulik.

1692
02:03:45,527 --> 02:03:56,637
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically they were honored for their contribution to their state's industry because there are about 48 video game companies in Washington state.

1693
02:03:57,357 --> 02:04:06,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And also they run a really, really excellent charity, The Child's Play, which has raised over $4.5 million for children's hospitals.

1694
02:04:07,445 --> 02:04:08,065
[SPEAKER_08]: So very good.

1695
02:04:09,686 --> 02:04:13,329
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, they also bring people to the state, like Penny Arcade Expo does.

1696
02:04:14,249 --> 02:04:18,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and, you know, just obviously, yeah, Penny Arcade Expo is probably a huge economy boost for the state, you know.

1697
02:04:18,713 --> 02:04:21,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially for the restaurants and the bars.

1698
02:04:21,915 --> 02:04:22,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1699
02:04:22,315 --> 02:04:23,276
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very happy about that.

1700
02:04:24,622 --> 02:04:44,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you may remember me talking about Eat Lead, The Return of Matt Hazard, a game that came out a couple weeks ago, actually last week, and kind of was a parody on the old video game genre and everything from old shareware games and RPGs and that kind of stuff.

1701
02:04:45,327 --> 02:04:51,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now they have a new Flash game that you can try out that actually recreates one of these fictional games

1702
02:04:52,328 --> 02:04:54,970
[SPEAKER_04]: in the history of Matt Hazard.

1703
02:04:55,931 --> 02:05:02,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game, of course, is Matt Hazard in Land Extreme Alpha Advance.

1704
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:08,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a game you can check out at MattHazardExtreme.com.

1705
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:11,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a parody of a 16-bit game.

1706
02:05:12,782 --> 02:05:18,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a nice photo of Matt Hazard destroying what looks like a robotic Pegasus.

1707
02:05:20,388 --> 02:05:20,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1708
02:05:21,918 --> 02:05:25,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Shadow in chat says, Matt Hazard is not good, quite simply.

1709
02:05:26,959 --> 02:05:28,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you a fan of Eat Lead eventually?

1710
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:31,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

1711
02:05:31,221 --> 02:05:32,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't great.

1712
02:05:33,061 --> 02:05:38,623
[SPEAKER_04]: The game itself is funny, but the way it plays is kind of crap.

1713
02:05:38,823 --> 02:05:44,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good idea on paper, and then they tried to make it, and it just wasn't working.

1714
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:46,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't work.

1715
02:05:46,886 --> 02:05:47,287
[SPEAKER_05]: ApoCrippa?

1716
02:06:05,508 --> 02:06:05,989
[SPEAKER_05]: AppleCrippa?

1717
02:06:06,309 --> 02:06:07,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how exactly you say that.

1718
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:08,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Apocrippa.

1719
02:06:08,971 --> 02:06:09,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Apocrippa.

1720
02:06:10,313 --> 02:06:11,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you say that.

1721
02:06:11,534 --> 02:06:17,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is the expansion that's coming out this week, and apparently it's going to kind of change some things about the game.

1722
02:06:17,559 --> 02:06:26,287
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a new player in the game, you get some new epic mission arcs that are going to help guide you through the different factions in the EVE Online game, and so this means it's going to be a little more new player-friendly.

1723
02:06:26,607 --> 02:06:29,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably to address some of those things that EVE Online is too damn difficult.

1724
02:06:29,869 --> 02:06:33,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot of people have gotten into this game and they get blown away because I guess the whole thing is PvP.

1725
02:06:33,932 --> 02:06:34,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will kind of help.

1726
02:06:34,973 --> 02:06:44,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're a veteran player and you want to get into this game, there will be some new wormholes that are going to show up in the game and you'll get some new enemies and some new items and things of that nature.

1727
02:06:45,219 --> 02:06:48,922
[SPEAKER_05]: The enemies will now change their tactics based on your performance.

1728
02:06:49,202 --> 02:06:55,847
[SPEAKER_05]: They might even call in backup, change some targets, use debuffs, whatever they're going to have to do to blow you up.

1729
02:06:56,747 --> 02:07:00,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So check out that EVE Online expansion for Apocrypha.

1730
02:07:01,511 --> 02:07:03,413
[SPEAKER_05]: A-P-O-C-R-Y-P-H-A.

1731
02:07:05,114 --> 02:07:05,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Apocrypha.

1732
02:07:05,815 --> 02:07:06,876
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds right, Apocrypha.

1733
02:07:08,017 --> 02:07:08,417
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1734
02:07:09,518 --> 02:07:10,779
[SPEAKER_05]: EVE Online, coming out soon.

1735
02:07:10,959 --> 02:07:13,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming up right now, the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

1736
02:07:13,882 --> 02:07:16,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send us your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1737
02:07:17,245 --> 02:07:20,387
[SPEAKER_05]: We pick a few of our favorites and read them live here on the show.

1738
02:07:20,508 --> 02:07:22,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura, why don't you dive into the mailbag?

1739
02:07:23,479 --> 02:07:27,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Pick out some emails and read them for us right now.

1740
02:07:28,881 --> 02:07:29,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, do I gotta?

1741
02:07:30,481 --> 02:07:30,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you do.

1742
02:07:31,622 --> 02:07:32,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1743
02:07:32,822 --> 02:07:38,544
[SPEAKER_08]: First email is... Hello to everyone at the Orange Lounge, including random guests.

1744
02:07:38,584 --> 02:07:42,185
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is one this week, that would just be Harvey, who is invisible.

1745
02:07:43,085 --> 02:07:45,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Pikachu, if you're watching Justin TV.

1746
02:07:45,026 --> 02:07:48,567
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have Pikachu, and he's armed with a sword tonight, which Loki's kind of sitting in front of us.

1747
02:07:48,587 --> 02:07:49,767
[SPEAKER_05]: He can't really see, but he does have a sword.

1748
02:07:49,787 --> 02:07:50,707
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Pimpin' Pikachu.

1749
02:07:50,727 --> 02:07:52,368
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, with his pimp hat tonight.

1750
02:07:54,043 --> 02:07:58,625
[SPEAKER_08]: The other week you were talking about British telly and stuff that isn't worth watching on the BBC.

1751
02:07:59,125 --> 02:08:04,648
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can access the BBC iPlayer, please, please, please make some time to watch a phenomenal new series called Being Human.

1752
02:08:05,108 --> 02:08:07,969
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about a vampire werewolf and a ghost that share a house in Bristol.

1753
02:08:08,589 --> 02:08:10,570
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is the best thing on TV at the moment.

1754
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:14,712
[SPEAKER_08]: It was MasterChef, but that's finished now.

1755
02:08:15,852 --> 02:08:17,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to know your thoughts.

1756
02:08:17,533 --> 02:08:21,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I should inject something game-related here, so here's my gaming week slash month.

1757
02:08:22,595 --> 02:08:23,076
[SPEAKER_08]: C.O.D.

1758
02:08:23,096 --> 02:08:25,498
[SPEAKER_08]: World at War on the Wii, as Tony the Tiger says.

1759
02:08:25,618 --> 02:08:26,399
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.

1760
02:08:26,859 --> 02:08:28,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Not sure if Tony the Tiger owns a Wii, though.

1761
02:08:28,921 --> 02:08:29,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going now.

1762
02:08:29,682 --> 02:08:29,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1763
02:08:30,342 --> 02:08:32,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Love from Chard, age 23 and a half.

1764
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:33,765
[SPEAKER_08]: No, wait, I'm nearly 33.

1765
02:08:34,466 --> 02:08:35,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck, where did that come from?

1766
02:08:36,828 --> 02:08:38,269
[SPEAKER_08]: That is what the email said, by the way.

1767
02:08:39,711 --> 02:08:40,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Which was beautiful.

1768
02:08:42,586 --> 02:08:44,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, the next one's big.

1769
02:08:45,149 --> 02:08:46,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Spousinator.

1770
02:08:47,651 --> 02:08:48,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, folks.

1771
02:08:48,712 --> 02:08:50,974
[SPEAKER_08]: If you three didn't mind, I have a few questions for you.

1772
02:08:51,434 --> 02:08:59,282
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, as of right now, I'm trying to change up how my 360 Elite is hooked up to my TV, mainly for convenience sake more than anything.

1773
02:08:59,742 --> 02:09:01,164
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I'm running into issues.

1774
02:09:01,304 --> 02:09:12,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, it's hooked up to my 32-inch 1080i HD TV via component cables, but I'd like to be hooked up by HDMI and passing through an HDMI switch on its way to my TV.

1775
02:09:12,998 --> 02:09:15,321
[SPEAKER_08]: As nearly as I can tell, it should be a no-brainer.

1776
02:09:16,122 --> 02:09:16,362
[SPEAKER_08]: All this...

1777
02:09:18,023 --> 02:09:20,825
[SPEAKER_08]: The seating seems correct, and it's just a matter of swapping cables.

1778
02:09:21,165 --> 02:09:24,908
[SPEAKER_08]: However, every time I do attempt to switch my TV, it tells me it's receiving an invalid signal.

1779
02:09:25,608 --> 02:09:28,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I read the 360's instructions, and it seems like I'm doing everything right.

1780
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:30,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I overlooking something obvious here?

1781
02:09:31,211 --> 02:09:33,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Before you say it, I know I won't see an improvement in picture.

1782
02:09:34,313 --> 02:09:41,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd just like the convenience of using my HDMI switch to switch between my cable box PS3 and PS3.

1783
02:09:42,278 --> 02:09:42,959
[SPEAKER_08]: You said PS3 twice.

1784
02:09:45,427 --> 02:09:46,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone care to tackle that?

1785
02:09:46,667 --> 02:09:48,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran out for just a minute.

1786
02:09:48,668 --> 02:09:49,968
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the heart of the question?

1787
02:09:49,988 --> 02:09:51,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I wanted to get a refill on my coffee.

1788
02:09:51,589 --> 02:09:53,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Something about not getting the right picture?

1789
02:09:53,569 --> 02:10:00,011
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to hook up his Xbox 360 Elite through the HDMI switch, but it's getting invalid signal.

1790
02:10:05,133 --> 02:10:05,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

1791
02:10:05,753 --> 02:10:08,414
[SPEAKER_05]: This might be a question better left for a Best Buy employee.

1792
02:10:08,474 --> 02:10:09,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any thoughts, Loki?

1793
02:10:09,614 --> 02:10:09,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1794
02:10:10,478 --> 02:10:10,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

1795
02:10:11,279 --> 02:10:13,160
[SPEAKER_05]: You should just hook it up and it should work.

1796
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:14,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it should just kind of work.

1797
02:10:14,782 --> 02:10:20,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now it's hooked up to my 32-inch HDTV via component cables, but I want it to be hooked up by HDMI.

1798
02:10:21,467 --> 02:10:22,648
[SPEAKER_05]: But it should be a no-brainer.

1799
02:10:22,668 --> 02:10:23,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it should be a no-brainer.

1800
02:10:23,869 --> 02:10:26,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I do attempt it, my Switch TV says I'm getting an invalid signal.

1801
02:10:27,352 --> 02:10:28,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Try new cables.

1802
02:10:28,513 --> 02:10:30,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's got to be the Switch, the cable.

1803
02:10:31,515 --> 02:10:32,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Something weird's going on there.

1804
02:10:32,676 --> 02:10:33,057
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

1805
02:10:33,157 --> 02:10:34,018
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be a no-brainer.

1806
02:10:34,058 --> 02:10:34,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It ought to just work.

1807
02:10:35,038 --> 02:10:36,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you probably thought of everything I might think of.

1808
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:39,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Should just be able to plug it in and go.

1809
02:10:40,082 --> 02:10:43,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Some thoughts from our chat room, because of course when we can't think of the answer, usually our chatters can.

1810
02:10:44,005 --> 02:10:46,507
[SPEAKER_05]: The Irish Gangster says, Microsoft wants you to buy a new cable.

1811
02:10:47,427 --> 02:10:50,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire says, you might have to use a Microsoft HDMI cable.

1812
02:10:50,309 --> 02:10:51,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, it doesn't matter.

1813
02:10:51,330 --> 02:10:55,292
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just an HDMI cable, but it sounds like, I don't know, some issue there.

1814
02:10:55,312 --> 02:10:58,274
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got cheap cables, though, then that might be the problem.

1815
02:10:59,615 --> 02:11:00,816
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually pretty much use them.

1816
02:11:00,916 --> 02:11:03,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we pretty much stick with the Monster cables at my house.

1817
02:11:03,057 --> 02:11:03,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1818
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:13,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've used that HDMI cable on anything else and maybe I've had issues.

1819
02:11:13,345 --> 02:11:18,869
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be just poor shielded or something and for some reason it's getting the wrong signal to it.

1820
02:11:18,929 --> 02:11:30,458
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another thing you can do maybe with it hooked up where you can reset your video settings on it and you might try that maybe booting up with the HDMI cable.

1821
02:11:30,478 --> 02:11:31,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you hold...

1822
02:11:32,469 --> 02:11:37,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it's either the right shoulder button or the right trigger and why, while you're booting up the system.

1823
02:11:37,693 --> 02:11:40,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure if you look on GameFAQs or something like that, it should say how to do it.

1824
02:11:41,135 --> 02:11:44,358
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them will reset the video, the other will format your hard drive, so be careful.

1825
02:11:44,418 --> 02:11:46,279
[SPEAKER_04]: No, one will not format your hard drive.

1826
02:11:46,579 --> 02:11:47,620
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something different.

1827
02:11:48,661 --> 02:11:49,421
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a reset.

1828
02:11:50,142 --> 02:11:52,263
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another one to reset your cache also.

1829
02:11:54,084 --> 02:11:57,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's the shoulder button or the right trigger.

1830
02:11:57,787 --> 02:11:59,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those and why.

1831
02:11:59,408 --> 02:12:00,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is the little...

1832
02:12:00,865 --> 02:12:01,165
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1833
02:12:16,786 --> 02:12:22,669
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt suggested he update it because they just updated the HDMI on Xbox Live.

1834
02:12:23,729 --> 02:12:27,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire says, I tried a generic cable and it didn't work, but it works on my PlayStation 3.

1835
02:12:28,112 --> 02:12:29,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Shadow says, don't buy monsters.

1836
02:12:30,893 --> 02:12:34,795
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt says, I got an HDMI cable for less than a dollar and it works great.

1837
02:12:35,195 --> 02:12:37,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony Tony Tony suggests switch to HDMI input.

1838
02:12:38,977 --> 02:12:43,000
[SPEAKER_05]: CableWholesale.com, that's a good place to check for cables on HDMI.

1839
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:44,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this might be the best advice yet.

1840
02:12:45,081 --> 02:12:47,343
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw suggests maybe it's a handshake issue.

1841
02:12:47,403 --> 02:12:53,927
[SPEAKER_05]: The HDMI switch must support HDCP, so maybe the switch is not good enough.

1842
02:12:54,288 --> 02:12:54,988
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good thought.

1843
02:12:55,768 --> 02:13:00,612
[SPEAKER_05]: And then lastly, another thing to test, SSJ100Matt says, try plugging the HDMI cable directly into the TV.

1844
02:13:01,572 --> 02:13:07,376
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a recruit who has not changed their name suggests they need to make sure their 360 is configured correctly.

1845
02:13:07,437 --> 02:13:09,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So, wow, that's like a million different options.

1846
02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:11,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope it works out for you, buddy.

1847
02:13:11,399 --> 02:13:12,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Let us know what happens.

1848
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:13,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to Jamie.

1849
02:13:13,501 --> 02:13:14,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Next part.

1850
02:13:14,361 --> 02:13:24,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, in regards to last week's story about the lesbian that got banned from Xbox Live after reporting being harassed by others, I have a bit of an odd nagging question, which honestly I'm surprised no one else has asked.

1851
02:13:25,362 --> 02:13:36,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to suggest in any way, shape, or form that Microsoft or the bullies were right, they obviously weren't by a long shot, but what exactly is the point of putting one's orientation on one's online profile on either Xbox Live or PSN?

1852
02:13:37,832 --> 02:13:53,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, I'm still fairly new to the whole Xbox Live scene and all, but as nearly as I can tell, the bio section of Xbox Live Profile is geared to inputting info about yourself that's gaming or gamer lifestyle related, such as what systems you own, what game genre players

1853
02:13:55,046 --> 02:13:56,752
[SPEAKER_08]: How long one has been gaming, etc.

1854
02:13:57,775 --> 02:14:01,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see how one's orientation, regardless of what it is, has anything to do with gaming.

1855
02:14:01,506 --> 02:14:01,767
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

1856
02:14:03,317 --> 02:14:18,947
[SPEAKER_08]: As I stated on the show last year, the one where there was the talk about the so-called offensive retooling of space invaders for the art slash commentary purposes, I'm all for the First Amendment rights regardless of whether or not others are offended, but somehow talk of one's orientation in Xbox Live seems a bit out of place.

1857
02:14:19,528 --> 02:14:28,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Although it's not perfect, the only analogy that comes to mind at the moment would be like going to an AA meeting and talking about all things Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1858
02:14:28,714 --> 02:14:32,717
[SPEAKER_08]: As with the analogy, AA meetings are for dealing with alcoholic issues, not TMNT.

1859
02:14:33,737 --> 02:14:37,339
[SPEAKER_08]: and as nearly as I figure BIOS and Xbox Live profile are meant to be gaming related.

1860
02:14:38,980 --> 02:14:40,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I missing something here?

1861
02:14:40,461 --> 02:14:42,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I way off the mark or missing the point here?

1862
02:14:44,043 --> 02:14:47,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I do hope that she gets her profile back and that she's not turned off from online gaming.

1863
02:14:48,746 --> 02:14:53,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Frankly, even though there are a-holes online, gaming on Xbox Live or PSN can be a lot of fun.

1864
02:14:56,161 --> 02:14:58,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to stab kittens in the face.

1865
02:14:58,963 --> 02:14:59,443
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a lesbian.

1866
02:15:21,858 --> 02:15:27,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder though if I Love the Stab Kittens in the Face would be considered offensive and if that would get banned.

1867
02:15:27,363 --> 02:15:28,124
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably would.

1868
02:15:28,204 --> 02:15:28,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't try it.

1869
02:15:29,565 --> 02:15:32,328
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, if that's what she really wants to put in her profile...

1870
02:15:33,783 --> 02:15:34,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Who am I to judge?

1871
02:15:34,564 --> 02:15:36,325
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people actually read their profiles?

1872
02:15:36,345 --> 02:15:36,426
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1873
02:15:57,318 --> 02:15:58,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

1874
02:15:58,519 --> 02:15:58,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Get ready.

1875
02:15:58,899 --> 02:16:00,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Only the old school gamers.

1876
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:00,520
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sega fans.

1877
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:01,761
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what it's from.

1878
02:16:01,841 --> 02:16:02,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, completely off topic.

1879
02:16:02,482 --> 02:16:03,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually found my copy of Space Fantasy Zone.

1880
02:16:19,670 --> 02:16:20,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats.

1881
02:16:20,891 --> 02:16:21,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a winner.

1882
02:16:21,752 --> 02:16:22,013
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.

1883
02:16:22,313 --> 02:16:22,533
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1884
02:16:22,573 --> 02:16:25,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I, you know, and, and somebody else has said, uh, what is it?

1885
02:16:25,497 --> 02:16:29,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Ponzi scheme in chat says, I listened to the interview on Major Nelson's podcast.

1886
02:16:29,441 --> 02:16:31,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft is being ultra PC with this issue.

1887
02:16:32,144 --> 02:16:34,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, of course they have to be ultra PC with this issue.

1888
02:16:34,647 --> 02:16:39,072
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to get, they don't want to get the pink mafia sick on them, which I completely understand.

1889
02:16:39,532 --> 02:16:45,716
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and obviously I think they realize this situation has been blown completely out of proportion.

1890
02:16:45,776 --> 02:16:46,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Internet.

1891
02:16:46,636 --> 02:16:48,537
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's something that needs to be addressed.

1892
02:16:48,697 --> 02:16:51,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be interesting to see what happens as a result.

1893
02:16:52,359 --> 02:16:52,639
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1894
02:16:52,739 --> 02:16:52,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Ready?

1895
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:53,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1896
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:55,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email.

1897
02:16:56,401 --> 02:16:56,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1898
02:16:56,702 --> 02:16:58,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say this one other comment from Ponzi Schema Chat.

1899
02:16:59,383 --> 02:17:01,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Olive Garden's never-ending pasta.

1900
02:17:01,344 --> 02:17:02,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I get banned for that?

1901
02:17:03,485 --> 02:17:04,526
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but you might get fat.

1902
02:17:05,807 --> 02:17:06,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Or diarrhea.

1903
02:17:07,242 --> 02:17:12,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey OLR Crew, I've listened to your show for the past three years or so and I thought it would be nice to give you some thanks.

1904
02:17:13,190 --> 02:17:18,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for helping me get through my customer service job, for entertaining me on long bus rides, and for keeping me sane.

1905
02:17:18,716 --> 02:17:23,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Your podcast was the first one I ever listened to and it's one that I look forward to listening to every week.

1906
02:17:24,884 --> 02:17:26,566
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another reason why I'm sending this email.

1907
02:17:26,786 --> 02:17:31,011
[SPEAKER_08]: You see, I am sick and tired of people sending emails with crappy punctuation, grammar, and spelling.

1908
02:17:31,371 --> 02:17:32,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Laziness is no excuse.

1909
02:17:33,133 --> 02:17:37,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it would be nice for DarkSakura to finally get a well-written, nearly error-free email for once.

1910
02:17:38,419 --> 02:17:43,885
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition, just for the sake of proof of concept, this email is written from my iPod Touch with autocorrect turned off.

1911
02:17:44,266 --> 02:17:46,208
[SPEAKER_08]: So you see people, it can be done.

1912
02:17:47,717 --> 02:17:48,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you.

1913
02:17:49,418 --> 02:17:51,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm stepping off my soapbox.

1914
02:17:51,099 --> 02:17:53,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe one day I'll email you with something video game related.

1915
02:17:53,701 --> 02:17:55,161
[SPEAKER_08]: But that will have to wait for another day.

1916
02:17:55,362 --> 02:17:56,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Midnight Skies.

1917
02:17:56,502 --> 02:17:58,483
[SPEAKER_08]: This presentation of Grammar Nazi has concluded.

1918
02:17:58,523 --> 02:18:00,965
[SPEAKER_08]: We now return you to your Orange Lounge Radio already in progress.

1919
02:18:02,386 --> 02:18:03,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I've found no errors.

1920
02:18:05,047 --> 02:18:05,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It was beautiful.

1921
02:18:06,228 --> 02:18:07,028
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want, a cookie?

1922
02:18:07,068 --> 02:18:07,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Fanfare!

1923
02:18:09,410 --> 02:18:13,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, don't make me dig up the soundboard.

1924
02:18:13,312 --> 02:18:14,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well you were already doing it.

1925
02:18:16,294 --> 02:18:19,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Midnight Skies.

1926
02:18:19,476 --> 02:18:28,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And, okay, and I think it was Sauce that pointed this out to me before, but I tend to read the emails like they're sent to me, including, you know, bad grammar, run-on sentences and all.

1927
02:18:30,081 --> 02:18:38,745
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you can tell from the fluid way in which this email was read that it was properly phrased and properly punctuated, that it didn't make my heart hurt.

1928
02:18:39,206 --> 02:18:40,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what's the emailer's name, Midnight Skies?

1929
02:18:41,027 --> 02:18:41,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Midnight Skies.

1930
02:18:41,507 --> 02:18:43,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Midnight Skies, congratulations!

1931
02:18:51,061 --> 02:18:51,702
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a cookie.

1932
02:18:52,502 --> 02:18:53,744
[SPEAKER_08]: This email is getting saved.

1933
02:18:53,804 --> 02:18:55,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Never delete it or I'll stab a kitten in the face.

1934
02:18:58,168 --> 02:18:59,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, any more emails?

1935
02:19:00,630 --> 02:19:01,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Next!

1936
02:19:01,771 --> 02:19:08,257
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an inquiry email via OrangeZonesRadio.com from, oh dude, we have that cool thing set up, don't we?

1937
02:19:09,418 --> 02:19:09,598
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1938
02:19:09,969 --> 02:19:11,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess this is through the website.

1939
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:12,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, anyway.

1940
02:19:12,970 --> 02:19:15,431
[SPEAKER_08]: This is me just going... Okay.

1941
02:19:15,771 --> 02:19:18,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey there, OLR... It's from Irene.

1942
02:19:18,812 --> 02:19:20,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just do the rest of the radio show.

1943
02:19:21,012 --> 02:19:23,233
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my tribute to Irene, the fart princess.

1944
02:19:24,913 --> 02:19:26,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey there, OLR crew.

1945
02:19:26,174 --> 02:19:27,754
[SPEAKER_08]: This be Lexo and yo.

1946
02:19:28,574 --> 02:19:28,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Leoxen?

1947
02:19:29,095 --> 02:19:29,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Laoxen?

1948
02:19:30,745 --> 02:19:31,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's Leo Shen.

1949
02:19:31,485 --> 02:19:33,086
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I've always said.

1950
02:19:34,147 --> 02:19:39,370
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I'd like to say that OLR has got to be my favorite video game show of all time.

1951
02:19:39,550 --> 02:19:46,154
[SPEAKER_08]: That aside, recently on your show I've heard the constant complaint that in Street Fighter 4, Seth, the final boss, is a cheap bitch.

1952
02:19:46,954 --> 02:19:50,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to show you all a fighting game boss that is even worse than Seth.

1953
02:19:50,955 --> 02:19:58,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone with the definition of a cheap bitch in fighting games who has the dreaded SNK boss syndrome times 10.

1954
02:19:59,718 --> 02:20:01,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I need to take a look at this.

1955
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:08,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also like to mention that the boss in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is also a cheap bitch.

1956
02:20:09,222 --> 02:20:09,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1957
02:20:09,902 --> 02:20:14,123
[SPEAKER_04]: We are looking at a video here in studio of a fight from Arcana Heart 2.

1958
02:20:15,264 --> 02:20:15,864
[SPEAKER_05]: That's brand new.

1959
02:20:17,139 --> 02:20:18,700
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm trying to, the video's buffering.

1960
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:19,760
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all chick fighting.

1961
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:21,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's not anything new.

1962
02:20:24,382 --> 02:20:24,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1963
02:20:25,342 --> 02:20:27,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so yes, I'm looking at this boss fight.

1964
02:20:27,763 --> 02:20:28,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're watching.

1965
02:20:28,383 --> 02:20:28,803
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a pretty game.

1966
02:20:29,364 --> 02:20:31,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty, but she's got nice boobies.

1967
02:20:31,524 --> 02:20:33,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can't, I can't falter for that.

1968
02:20:33,785 --> 02:20:34,806
[SPEAKER_04]: She's way too covered, though.

1969
02:20:34,906 --> 02:20:35,886
[SPEAKER_04]: At least the one on the left is.

1970
02:20:36,666 --> 02:20:38,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So the video's a little bit of a low quality.

1971
02:20:38,087 --> 02:20:39,948
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm saying, the one on the right.

1972
02:20:40,208 --> 02:20:42,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway, I'm sorry.

1973
02:20:42,228 --> 02:20:43,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did you see those?

1974
02:20:43,549 --> 02:20:44,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

1975
02:20:44,549 --> 02:20:46,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That's her, like, knee bouncy.

1976
02:20:47,011 --> 02:20:47,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sorry, what's the rest of the email?

1977
02:20:48,695 --> 02:20:52,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually just watching the... Oh my god, cheat bitch much?

1978
02:20:53,747 --> 02:20:54,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn!

1979
02:20:56,533 --> 02:20:57,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so...

1980
02:20:58,837 --> 02:21:01,039
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a special pink controller that you can get for this.

1981
02:21:01,719 --> 02:21:02,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1982
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:03,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I want it.

1983
02:21:04,001 --> 02:21:04,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I want this game.

1984
02:21:05,722 --> 02:21:07,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm going to have to get this game.

1985
02:21:07,344 --> 02:21:07,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1986
02:21:08,284 --> 02:21:12,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, back to the email that was currently in progress.

1987
02:21:13,668 --> 02:21:17,111
[SPEAKER_08]: She happens to come from the all-girl fighter called Sugoi Arcana Heart 2.

1988
02:21:17,511 --> 02:21:19,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Sugoi means WOW!

1989
02:21:20,374 --> 02:21:22,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name is... I think that's what Loki said when he saw those boobies.

1990
02:21:22,956 --> 02:21:23,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1991
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:27,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Her name is Paraslesia, I guess.

1992
02:21:27,803 --> 02:21:31,525
[SPEAKER_08]: And she just happens to be an elven woman who can summon four elemental spheres to take you down.

1993
02:21:31,805 --> 02:21:33,226
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes her so bad, you may ask?

1994
02:21:33,346 --> 02:21:40,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first off, she has an auto-regen super meter, some special attacks that when they connect, it spells an instant 70% or more of your health depleted.

1995
02:21:41,511 --> 02:21:42,032
[SPEAKER_08]: We did notice that.

1996
02:21:42,052 --> 02:21:42,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Email her.

1997
02:22:02,214 --> 02:22:05,655
[SPEAKER_08]: She can be beaten, but you need some mad skills to do so.

1998
02:22:06,016 --> 02:22:07,876
[SPEAKER_08]: The video shows her on normal mode.

1999
02:22:08,417 --> 02:22:11,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I can honestly say that she's just as bad on easier modes.

2000
02:22:11,958 --> 02:22:13,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine if Seth was like that, OLR.

2001
02:22:14,379 --> 02:22:19,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet some people would have stopped playing Street Fighter 4 arcade mode altogether if Seth was that tough.

2002
02:22:20,061 --> 02:22:26,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I do have to mention that Seth is sort of like, you know, wearing just like a thong type thing.

2003
02:22:26,984 --> 02:22:29,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be fine if she was just wearing just a thong.

2004
02:22:31,431 --> 02:22:31,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Let her finish.

2005
02:22:31,791 --> 02:22:34,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just wanted to show a boss that would make Seth her bitch.

2006
02:22:35,354 --> 02:22:38,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep up the great work with the show, but Seth does gut suck.

2007
02:22:39,456 --> 02:22:42,098
[SPEAKER_08]: You're fighting game addicted listener, Lioshen.

2008
02:22:42,999 --> 02:22:43,339
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

2009
02:22:43,359 --> 02:22:45,420
[SPEAKER_08]: This message is brought to you by Sugoi Arcana Hearts 2.

2010
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:47,141
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so good, you'll slap your mama.

2011
02:22:47,662 --> 02:22:48,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Kidding, of course.

2012
02:22:48,582 --> 02:22:49,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you, mama.

2013
02:22:49,543 --> 02:22:50,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace out, OLR.

2014
02:22:52,105 --> 02:22:53,025
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a pretty funny email, I think.

2015
02:22:53,045 --> 02:22:57,989
[SPEAKER_08]: That means that almost every other sequel that comes out, we should all say Sugoi in front of it.

2016
02:22:59,129 --> 02:22:59,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, wow.

2017
02:23:01,016 --> 02:23:01,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys!

2018
02:23:01,977 --> 02:23:04,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, sorry, I was on the next email.

2019
02:23:04,418 --> 02:23:08,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Shadow in chat says, Well, who doesn't have a jiggle in their breast when unleashing their special?

2020
02:23:08,621 --> 02:23:10,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't be the only one without problem.

2021
02:23:10,682 --> 02:23:14,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the next email is from Dan Shadow.

2022
02:23:14,644 --> 02:23:15,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well then let's hear it.

2023
02:23:16,175 --> 02:23:19,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is one of my most cherished games.

2024
02:23:20,319 --> 02:23:25,163
[SPEAKER_08]: After school, my friends and I would go to the local pizza place and just rock that arcade every day.

2025
02:23:25,283 --> 02:23:26,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that a new one will be made.

2026
02:23:27,224 --> 02:23:31,608
[SPEAKER_08]: To get to the point, what new Marvel fighters do you think should make it into a new game if one was made today?

2027
02:23:32,108 --> 02:23:33,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Which characters deserve to get scrapped?

2028
02:23:33,710 --> 02:23:39,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally hope Dante from Devil May Cry, the Bionic Commando, and Bucky as Captain America would be in it.

2029
02:23:39,655 --> 02:23:42,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep it real guys, the Cold Stone is delicious.

2030
02:23:42,777 --> 02:23:43,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Deadpool!

2031
02:23:45,059 --> 02:23:47,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Deadpool in my damn fighting game.

2032
02:23:49,243 --> 02:23:51,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you imagine Deadpool versus Dan?

2033
02:23:52,646 --> 02:23:56,550
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be funny as fuck because it would be taunting back and forth the whole time.

2034
02:23:57,131 --> 02:23:58,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Except Deadpool would pull out a gun.

2035
02:23:58,912 --> 02:24:05,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the comic book knowledge to really answer that question from the Marvel standpoint, but from the Capcom standpoint, I agree with the Bionic Commando guy with the arm.

2036
02:24:05,979 --> 02:24:06,920
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be pretty hilarious.

2037
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:08,441
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good suggestion.

2038
02:24:08,661 --> 02:24:10,582
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a helper in the first Marvel vs. Capcom.

2039
02:24:11,622 --> 02:24:15,363
[SPEAKER_08]: This is who I would see, though, in my dream from Capcom characters.

2040
02:24:16,203 --> 02:24:23,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I would actually... You totally need to leave Strider Hero in it, but I would actually have a palette swap for He-In from Strider 2.

2041
02:24:25,566 --> 02:24:30,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, you should totally have... For playable, I agree with the new Captain America.

2042
02:24:31,447 --> 02:24:31,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

2043
02:24:31,927 --> 02:24:36,989
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have... Well, I would totally say put Luke Cage in it, because...

2044
02:24:37,742 --> 02:24:39,303
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Arthur from Ghouls N' Ghosts?

2045
02:24:39,383 --> 02:24:42,905
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a helper, and honestly, I don't see him doing the fighting type.

2046
02:24:43,005 --> 02:24:45,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless maybe if he was on a second bard, he fought in his underwear.

2047
02:24:45,727 --> 02:24:50,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was just going to say, when he gets down to low life, his suit gets knocked off or whatever.

2048
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:52,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Or he has the gold armor during a power-up.

2049
02:24:52,952 --> 02:24:53,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2050
02:24:53,412 --> 02:24:54,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm stupid.

2051
02:24:54,033 --> 02:24:54,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Forte.

2052
02:24:56,014 --> 02:24:58,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Or... Bass.

2053
02:25:00,056 --> 02:25:00,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

2054
02:25:00,697 --> 02:25:01,978
[SPEAKER_08]: From Rockman.

2055
02:25:02,178 --> 02:25:02,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

2056
02:25:03,279 --> 02:25:03,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

2057
02:25:07,951 --> 02:25:09,653
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd actually like to see Ingrid.

2058
02:25:11,214 --> 02:25:12,716
[SPEAKER_08]: And I definitely want Sakura in the game.

2059
02:25:13,877 --> 02:25:18,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2060
02:25:18,262 --> 02:25:19,464
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just so much to choose from.

2061
02:25:20,305 --> 02:25:21,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, enough fanboy wank.

2062
02:25:21,847 --> 02:25:22,167
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2063
02:25:23,468 --> 02:25:24,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Wank, wank, wank.

2064
02:25:24,509 --> 02:25:27,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of wank, oh, I'm sorry, that was wang today.

2065
02:25:28,311 --> 02:25:29,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, in the Watchmen movie?

2066
02:25:29,591 --> 02:25:29,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2067
02:25:29,891 --> 02:25:30,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard, I've heard.

2068
02:25:30,592 --> 02:25:32,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Big blue cock.

2069
02:25:32,513 --> 02:25:34,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's all CGI, though.

2070
02:25:34,434 --> 02:25:37,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I will go ahead and tell everybody this who's going to see the movie.

2071
02:25:39,016 --> 02:25:43,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you're like looking at his crotch, the cock is not distracting.

2072
02:25:45,179 --> 02:25:46,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you're looking for it.

2073
02:25:46,059 --> 02:25:47,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Cock is always distracting.

2074
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:48,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, DarkSakura.

2075
02:25:49,121 --> 02:25:51,662
[SPEAKER_08]: It glowed with the rest of him, so it was kind of hard to see.

2076
02:25:52,648 --> 02:25:53,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want six-story cock?

2077
02:26:16,820 --> 02:26:18,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want it to be blue and radioactive?

2078
02:26:18,863 --> 02:26:19,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.

2079
02:26:23,348 --> 02:26:27,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get one more story and then we're going to open up the Skype line to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR

2080
02:26:30,575 --> 02:26:39,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, let's see, there's some possible announcements that are going to happen later this week, actually.

2081
02:26:40,082 --> 02:26:53,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposedly on March 12th, kind of going along with their whole launch event for Resident Evil 5 in San Francisco, there is some evidence suggesting that they're going to announce a brand new Resident Evil title for the Wii.

2082
02:26:54,213 --> 02:26:59,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And that Resident Evil title just might be a port or remake of Resident Evil Code Veronica.

2083
02:26:59,938 --> 02:27:00,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2084
02:27:00,618 --> 02:27:12,663
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently there's been a lot of rumors going around saying, hey, if you're a Resident Evil Wii fan, we've got some great news for you.

2085
02:27:15,265 --> 02:27:15,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2086
02:27:15,705 --> 02:27:23,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, I didn't think Code Veronica was that great from what I remember reading as far as reviews go and stuff.

2087
02:27:24,691 --> 02:27:25,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2088
02:27:26,132 --> 02:27:30,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Code Veronica did come out, though, on the GameCube back in 2003.

2089
02:27:31,015 --> 02:27:36,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they're doing a Resident Evil 4 Wii version type thing for this.

2090
02:27:37,859 --> 02:27:38,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2091
02:27:38,159 --> 02:27:39,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe just adding the Wii controls to it.

2092
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:42,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that would be that exciting if that's what they're doing.

2093
02:27:43,462 --> 02:27:46,263
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe a brand new Code Veronica game.

2094
02:27:46,303 --> 02:27:46,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

2095
02:27:46,804 --> 02:27:48,664
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe a brand new Resident Evil game for the Wii.

2096
02:27:48,684 --> 02:27:49,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything, I guess, is pretty good.

2097
02:27:52,266 --> 02:27:55,167
[SPEAKER_05]: AcidicVampire wonders aloud in our chat room, why Veronica?

2098
02:27:55,207 --> 02:27:56,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not Resident Evil 2?

2099
02:27:57,268 --> 02:27:57,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2100
02:27:58,349 --> 02:28:07,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe because, you know, not that... I want to say not that many people had a Dreamcast, but compared to the Wii, not that many people had a Dreamcast.

2101
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:14,354
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Rob D in chat says the reviews for the Code Veronica were all pretty good on the Dreamcast.

2102
02:28:15,415 --> 02:28:20,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, hey, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2103
02:28:20,999 --> 02:28:23,541
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to open up the phone lines right now to take your calls.

2104
02:28:24,121 --> 02:28:25,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any last minute stories while we're waiting?

2105
02:28:25,983 --> 02:28:31,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we hit out almost everything that was in the show roll thread this week, but I don't know, Loki, did anything come up last minute tonight?

2106
02:28:32,028 --> 02:28:32,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Or DarkSakura?

2107
02:28:33,108 --> 02:28:33,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Cock.

2108
02:28:33,489 --> 02:28:36,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I was waiting for you to take a sip.

2109
02:28:36,931 --> 02:28:37,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I timed it wrong.

2110
02:28:39,209 --> 02:28:39,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had coffee.

2111
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:44,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran in during that last story because I've drank two cups of coffee, so you know why I had to run in the house.

2112
02:28:44,652 --> 02:28:45,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to explain.

2113
02:28:45,253 --> 02:28:46,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob had to tinkle.

2114
02:28:46,213 --> 02:28:46,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2115
02:28:48,875 --> 02:28:49,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2116
02:28:50,076 --> 02:28:55,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess like a small thing, I guess some of the cars from Burnout are going to be in Godfather 2.

2117
02:28:56,619 --> 02:28:57,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2118
02:28:57,240 --> 02:28:59,141
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't make any sense to me, but okay.

2119
02:28:59,361 --> 02:28:59,601
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2120
02:28:59,621 --> 02:29:00,442
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a call on the line.

2121
02:29:00,482 --> 02:29:01,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2122
02:29:01,502 --> 02:29:01,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2123
02:29:02,762 --> 02:29:04,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Brest Law, how you guys doing?

2124
02:29:04,102 --> 02:29:05,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Brest Law!

2125
02:29:05,103 --> 02:29:07,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, we haven't heard from you on the show in a long time.

2126
02:29:07,244 --> 02:29:10,145
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in chat, you never shut up, but it's nice to hear your actual voice.

2127
02:29:10,165 --> 02:29:10,725
[SPEAKER_02]: How have you been?

2128
02:29:10,745 --> 02:29:11,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you're talking about.

2129
02:29:13,106 --> 02:29:13,706
[SPEAKER_02]: How have you been, sir?

2130
02:29:14,486 --> 02:29:20,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been well, except for my Xbox red-ringing, which is the complete stem of that little rant I wrote on our news page.

2131
02:29:22,669 --> 02:29:31,492
[SPEAKER_02]: But before it red-ringed, a mini-review of a game that's been out for a while, the Sega Sonic Genesis Mega Collection.

2132
02:29:31,692 --> 02:29:31,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2133
02:29:33,257 --> 02:29:34,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys have talked about this.

2134
02:29:35,138 --> 02:29:35,498
[SPEAKER_02]: We have.

2135
02:29:35,558 --> 02:29:38,099
[SPEAKER_05]: We lavished Fanboy Wank upon it a few weeks ago.

2136
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:43,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the best bang for your buck on the Xbox right now.

2137
02:29:44,122 --> 02:29:45,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost 50 games for $30.

2138
02:29:47,743 --> 02:29:48,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get a lot of play out of it.

2139
02:29:49,004 --> 02:29:52,245
[SPEAKER_02]: You get two Shining Forces, four Phantasy Stars, all the Sonics.

2140
02:29:53,506 --> 02:29:56,187
[SPEAKER_02]: There's at least 80 hours of gameplay in there.

2141
02:29:58,088 --> 02:29:59,848
[SPEAKER_02]: What I didn't really like is...

2142
02:30:01,488 --> 02:30:04,452
[SPEAKER_02]: You can change the video settings, but it's only within each game.

2143
02:30:04,632 --> 02:30:05,634
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a global setting.

2144
02:30:05,994 --> 02:30:06,996
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets kind of annoying.

2145
02:30:08,398 --> 02:30:15,347
[SPEAKER_02]: The games also, just like everything else that's happened with old ports, they don't look good in 720p.

2146
02:30:15,708 --> 02:30:16,149
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they don't.

2147
02:30:16,389 --> 02:30:16,950
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

2148
02:30:18,131 --> 02:30:23,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree maybe a global setting would be nice, but the game does remember from game to game how you have it set.

2149
02:30:23,313 --> 02:30:28,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So some games look better with that stretched faux 16x9 than others.

2150
02:30:28,896 --> 02:30:34,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Other games were not meant to be played in that stretched 16x9, but games like Sonic Spinball actually work really well in the stretched 16x9.

2151
02:30:36,249 --> 02:31:05,770
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely I agree with that I mean a lot of those Sonic games look good in 16x9 and you know the smoothing feature is probably one of the worst things I've seen but there's two games that actually look good with them and they're Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles but overall it's 30 bucks go get it yeah it's not bad I actually reviewed it on PlayStation 3 because I when I went to get it they didn't have it on 360 so I just said eh what the hell it's the same game so I got it on PlayStation 3 but you know same same and it's a great collection yeah absolutely and um

2152
02:31:06,974 --> 02:31:07,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario Bros.

2153
02:31:07,615 --> 02:31:08,155
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 vs. Rock Band

2154
02:31:23,573 --> 02:31:29,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know at least one person on the air right now voted Rock Band very protest-like.

2155
02:31:30,399 --> 02:31:30,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2156
02:31:31,459 --> 02:31:33,061
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was me.

2157
02:31:33,941 --> 02:31:40,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I wanted revenge on Tetris for it beating Super Metroid, but I still believe Rock Band has no business being in the top four games of all time.

2158
02:31:40,707 --> 02:31:42,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario 3, I can see that.

2159
02:31:42,868 --> 02:31:43,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that.

2160
02:31:45,116 --> 02:31:49,079
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes from this show's roots as a music game show.

2161
02:31:49,099 --> 02:31:50,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, I understand that.

2162
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:54,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, I spent most of my gaming week playing Rock Band.

2163
02:31:54,622 --> 02:31:59,284
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that I dislike Rock Band by any means, but it's no Mario 3.

2164
02:31:59,705 --> 02:32:03,567
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no Final Four game, and it's no One Seed.

2165
02:32:04,207 --> 02:32:05,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe in a couple years.

2166
02:32:05,268 --> 02:32:07,069
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to age like a wine a little bit.

2167
02:32:07,591 --> 02:32:09,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Link to the Past

2168
02:32:31,592 --> 02:32:44,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have a hard time accepting that Chrono Trigger beat Final Fantasy 6, but that's my own, because I love Final Fantasy 6, but I understand there is so much fanboy wank, for lack of a better term, out there for Chrono Trigger, especially with the recent release.

2169
02:32:45,324 --> 02:32:54,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that, but I'm a little disappointed that Final Fantasy 6 didn't pull through, but I guess if it's going to be beat, at least it didn't get beat by like...

2170
02:32:54,813 --> 02:32:55,954
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR or something.

2171
02:32:55,974 --> 02:32:56,495
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

2172
02:32:56,575 --> 02:32:59,298
[SPEAKER_05]: If Final Fantasy 6 is going to get beaten by a game, at least it was Chrono Trigger.

2173
02:32:59,338 --> 02:33:01,721
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I can say, okay, I understand that.

2174
02:33:02,061 --> 02:33:02,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

2175
02:33:03,183 --> 02:33:06,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's the same thing along Mario 3 beating DDR, finally.

2176
02:33:07,147 --> 02:33:07,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2177
02:33:09,909 --> 02:33:18,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you haven't heard and you are in the Pacific Northwest area, the convention that I staff at, SakuraCon, is going to have SmileDK there.

2178
02:33:18,675 --> 02:33:21,997
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their second North American appearance ever.

2179
02:33:22,818 --> 02:33:27,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a month, so I think pre-registration closes next Sunday.

2180
02:33:28,381 --> 02:33:32,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's $45 for all three days, so if you want to go and meet SmileDK.

2181
02:33:33,204 --> 02:33:36,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we're going to be doing Under Sedation Live on location.

2182
02:33:37,407 --> 02:33:38,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Travis going out there for that?

2183
02:33:39,147 --> 02:33:45,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Travis is not, but we have an internet connection and they're sure to be a lot of fun involved with that.

2184
02:33:46,352 --> 02:33:46,632
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2185
02:33:46,692 --> 02:33:53,456
[SPEAKER_05]: If the Southwest prices stay low, I might just have to consider it because my friend can give me a really good discount on rooms and stuff.

2186
02:33:54,117 --> 02:34:00,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have to consider it, Press Low, because especially if you can get us an interview with SmileDK, I might really have to do it.

2187
02:34:00,921 --> 02:34:01,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, absolutely.

2188
02:34:03,055 --> 02:34:03,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2189
02:34:04,276 --> 02:34:04,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2190
02:34:04,816 --> 02:34:08,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't speak for the other two, but I will always take an excuse to go to Seattle.

2191
02:34:09,499 --> 02:34:09,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

2192
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:11,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I took an excuse to move here.

2193
02:34:12,001 --> 02:34:20,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but then at the same time, I've also been promising Chicago for years and years, and I kind of feel like an obligation that if I'm going to do one, I kind of need to make ASEN happen, but we'll see.

2194
02:34:22,079 --> 02:34:22,399
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.

2195
02:34:22,859 --> 02:34:26,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's it, really, from here in Seattle.

2196
02:34:26,321 --> 02:34:28,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So, nice hearing from you guys again.

2197
02:34:28,301 --> 02:34:28,682
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2198
02:34:28,762 --> 02:34:30,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you as well, Breslow.

2199
02:34:30,422 --> 02:34:32,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And keep writing those articles for the website.

2200
02:34:32,783 --> 02:34:33,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Good time.

2201
02:34:33,123 --> 02:34:33,363
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2202
02:34:34,064 --> 02:34:35,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way... Yes.

2203
02:34:37,345 --> 02:34:38,865
[SPEAKER_05]: He hung up on us, little bastard.

2204
02:34:39,265 --> 02:34:39,526
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2205
02:34:42,519 --> 02:34:50,984
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, speaking of articles on the website, while we're waiting for another call at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, I wanted to plug something on the website real quick.

2206
02:34:51,004 --> 02:34:56,027
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an article that was just posted, and I thought this was actually a pretty good idea, something that was posted by Deekman.

2207
02:34:56,327 --> 02:35:02,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a different contest here for the best Konami games, because Konami's 40th birthday is coming up in a couple weeks.

2208
02:35:03,951 --> 02:35:14,477
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to actually do on OrangeLoungeRadio.com the top three favorite Konami games is what you post, and then we're going to count down the top five games in special highlight articles.

2209
02:35:14,897 --> 02:35:15,517
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of fun.

2210
02:35:15,898 --> 02:35:17,738
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of counting down the top Konami games.

2211
02:35:18,219 --> 02:35:25,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we have a history with Konami here at this station, so I fully expect that Beatmania 2DX will be the number one.

2212
02:35:25,182 --> 02:35:25,883
[SPEAKER_05]: How can it not?

2213
02:35:26,583 --> 02:35:31,105
[SPEAKER_05]: With our audience, I would be shocked and awed if Beatmania 2DX is not number one.

2214
02:35:31,125 --> 02:35:32,126
[SPEAKER_08]: That wouldn't be my number one.

2215
02:35:32,914 --> 02:35:35,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2216
02:35:35,395 --> 02:35:36,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to sit down and think long and hard.

2217
02:35:36,996 --> 02:35:39,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd really have to look at a big list of Konami games.

2218
02:35:39,578 --> 02:35:41,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I would put some obscure shit in there, though.

2219
02:35:41,679 --> 02:35:42,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I would tell you that.

2220
02:35:42,239 --> 02:35:43,620
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what the top of my list would be, Rob?

2221
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:44,020
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

2222
02:35:44,300 --> 02:35:47,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Dracula X. Ah, ooh, that is Castlevania.

2223
02:35:47,702 --> 02:35:48,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's tough.

2224
02:35:48,583 --> 02:35:49,743
[SPEAKER_08]: That one specifically.

2225
02:35:50,304 --> 02:35:51,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

2226
02:35:52,485 --> 02:35:55,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

2227
02:35:55,486 --> 02:36:00,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go back to the phones because it's been ringing, and I'm sorry, guys, if I haven't been picking up, but I wanted to get that out there.

2228
02:36:00,589 --> 02:36:01,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2229
02:36:01,570 --> 02:36:01,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2230
02:36:02,711 --> 02:36:03,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's Ranma.

2231
02:36:03,532 --> 02:36:04,272
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everyone?

2232
02:36:04,472 --> 02:36:04,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much.

2233
02:36:04,812 --> 02:36:05,453
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, Ranma?

2234
02:36:06,734 --> 02:36:06,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

2235
02:36:06,994 --> 02:36:09,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recovering from restoring windows on my computer.

2236
02:36:10,036 --> 02:36:11,497
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, life's been pretty good.

2237
02:36:11,677 --> 02:36:11,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2238
02:36:13,258 --> 02:36:13,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, good.

2239
02:36:13,938 --> 02:36:15,480
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we owe this phone call to tonight?

2240
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:18,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Some information that I happened to come across.

2241
02:36:18,642 --> 02:36:21,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant to discuss the last time I spoke to you guys.

2242
02:36:22,204 --> 02:36:26,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you know, Sega was at Comic-Con back in February.

2243
02:36:27,728 --> 02:36:28,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

2244
02:36:28,846 --> 02:36:34,352
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that another video game company is looking into going at the conventions as well.

2245
02:36:35,413 --> 02:36:35,793
[SPEAKER_00]: How so?

2246
02:36:37,215 --> 02:36:43,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you guys know, I work for a company where we go to cons, we set up booths, and we sell items.

2247
02:36:43,521 --> 02:36:43,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Now...

2248
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:54,203
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing Anime Boston in May, and we just got information about a couple of weeks ago, about two, three weeks ago, about our location, where we're going to be.

2249
02:36:54,923 --> 02:37:01,585
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that our booth is going to be, you ready for this, directly across from Nintendo.

2250
02:37:02,626 --> 02:37:04,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh, interesting.

2251
02:37:06,607 --> 02:37:09,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, okay, so Nintendo is going around the cons.

2252
02:37:09,328 --> 02:37:10,708
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think they're going to be showing off?

2253
02:37:10,868 --> 02:37:12,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's just the Wii, or what?

2254
02:37:13,664 --> 02:37:14,685
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.

2255
02:37:14,865 --> 02:37:27,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking either they're going to be like a booth version of Nintendo World set up there, or actually Nintendo will be coming down with kiosks with the displays that show off a lot of games.

2256
02:37:30,481 --> 02:37:37,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering the business that you're in, if it's what I think it is, if it's still the same, I think that's very funny that you're going to be directly across from Nintendo, actually.

2257
02:37:38,860 --> 02:37:51,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because they kind of screwed us over at one convention, they gave us first dibs, and when we picked it, that's when we found out afterwards that Nintendo's directly across from us, so everyone at the booth will be doing Nintendo-themed cosplays.

2258
02:37:52,876 --> 02:37:54,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha, I see.

2259
02:37:54,237 --> 02:37:55,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, trying to get some attention.

2260
02:37:55,937 --> 02:37:56,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Very smart.

2261
02:37:57,258 --> 02:37:57,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we try.

2262
02:37:58,078 --> 02:37:58,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Very smart.

2263
02:37:59,159 --> 02:38:08,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I expect a full report and pictures because sadly, Anime Boston, I don't think, you know, considering I've got two other cons I'm trying to weigh between, I don't think Anime Boston's going to happen.

2264
02:38:09,203 --> 02:38:14,505
[SPEAKER_05]: However, however, PAX East Coast in 2010, you know I want to go to that.

2265
02:38:14,985 --> 02:38:16,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you best be there, man.

2266
02:38:16,606 --> 02:38:18,286
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be my arrival in Boston.

2267
02:38:18,326 --> 02:38:21,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have internet friends in that area that I want to go visit anyway, so it works out.

2268
02:38:23,106 --> 02:38:23,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

2269
02:38:24,267 --> 02:38:25,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good luck with that.

2270
02:38:25,688 --> 02:38:28,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other conventions coming up that we ought to know about or our listeners?

2271
02:38:29,331 --> 02:38:45,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're in New York, New Jersey, Tri-State area coming up, we have Castle Point Anime Convention, Hoboken, New Jersey, and Icon 29, I believe, which is one of the East Coast's biggest sci-fi conventions.

2272
02:38:45,144 --> 02:38:47,246
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sci-fi and medieval arts.

2273
02:38:48,891 --> 02:38:51,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sci-fi and medieval arts.

2274
02:38:52,273 --> 02:38:59,256
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminds me of that whole Margaret Cho joke about why is it that Star Trek always seems to go hand-in-hand with the Ren Faire.

2275
02:39:00,657 --> 02:39:01,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, sorry, random thought.

2276
02:39:02,478 --> 02:39:06,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you, but Star Trek can go with almost anything, you know?

2277
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:07,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It really can, it really can.

2278
02:39:07,801 --> 02:39:10,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much.

2279
02:39:10,622 --> 02:39:11,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, cool.

2280
02:39:11,183 --> 02:39:12,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, later.

2281
02:39:13,024 --> 02:39:15,905
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of you guys hammering the line tonight, so I want to try to get to as many calls as I can.

2282
02:39:15,965 --> 02:39:17,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2283
02:39:18,422 --> 02:39:21,424
[SPEAKER_05]: DSMaster26 Hi DSMaster26, what's on your mind?

2284
02:39:22,765 --> 02:39:36,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much more game review for you and a few comments and suggestions for the show Alrighty Well, um, cause I'm an F-Zero fan, I mean, who isn't in this house, you know?

2285
02:39:37,577 --> 02:39:40,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Love F-Zero, wish they would put a new one out on the Wii already, yeah?

2286
02:39:41,880 --> 02:39:47,605
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to fill the time, I'm waiting for a freaking DS version to come out I have a PSP here, as you can tell

2287
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:52,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm like, you know, it's a lot better to fill it than wipe out pure, right?

2288
02:39:53,563 --> 02:39:55,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, okay.

2289
02:39:57,025 --> 02:39:58,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I stored up everything.

2290
02:39:58,506 --> 02:40:04,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I have all my friend's game saves who had all the classic packs and everything because I can't download them for some weirdo reason.

2291
02:40:04,170 --> 02:40:06,291
[SPEAKER_06]: They closed the site to download stuff for them.

2292
02:40:07,052 --> 02:40:10,654
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a little bit more challenging than that, so I'll tell you that.

2293
02:40:11,903 --> 02:40:12,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

2294
02:40:12,203 --> 02:40:14,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played the Wipeout on PlayStation Network.

2295
02:40:14,604 --> 02:40:15,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the name of it.

2296
02:40:15,525 --> 02:40:16,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just Wipeout HD.

2297
02:40:17,245 --> 02:40:19,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a little harder than F-Zero.

2298
02:40:19,827 --> 02:40:21,507
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a different style, too.

2299
02:40:21,667 --> 02:40:25,769
[SPEAKER_05]: F-Zero to me is a little more cartoony, but don't take that too literally.

2300
02:40:25,949 --> 02:40:26,470
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

2301
02:40:26,550 --> 02:40:31,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Like F-Zero GX especially, which is one of my favorite racing games ever, is not definitely a cartoony-looking game.

2302
02:40:31,952 --> 02:40:36,774
[SPEAKER_05]: But Wipeout feels a little more, I don't know, just a little more edgy than F-Zero.

2303
02:40:38,335 --> 02:40:40,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually that's a term that means one's better than the other.

2304
02:40:40,196 --> 02:40:40,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in this case.

2305
02:40:44,322 --> 02:40:47,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but it's so hard to get on your show sometimes.

2306
02:40:49,065 --> 02:40:54,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you guys ever thought of doing an open mic or conference call with Skype?

2307
02:40:54,868 --> 02:40:57,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Like AGI and DPL did?

2308
02:40:58,530 --> 02:40:58,950
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean?

2309
02:40:59,011 --> 02:41:03,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just opening it up so that every person can come on and chat and stuff?

2310
02:41:06,935 --> 02:41:16,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the only problem with that is that we try to cover a lot of ground during the show, and I think if we did that, it would just kind of turn into this giant cluster of a show.

2311
02:41:16,897 --> 02:41:26,239
[SPEAKER_05]: What I would love, I would love to take calls throughout the show, but we need somebody to screen the calls in order to be able to do that to make sure people are going to stay on topic again so the show can flow.

2312
02:41:26,719 --> 02:41:30,440
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the feedback I hear about the show very often is that it's almost a little too long.

2313
02:41:30,860 --> 02:41:34,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would just be afraid that if we did kind of just... I mean, we got on enough tangents as it is.

2314
02:41:34,601 --> 02:41:39,103
[SPEAKER_05]: If we let it get on even more tangents, I'd just be afraid we'd be here for six hours.

2315
02:41:39,563 --> 02:41:45,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, I do love this show, but I also love going to bed at a decent hour.

2316
02:41:46,145 --> 02:41:49,446
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, that's why we do at least a Skype line, try to get the feedback.

2317
02:41:49,506 --> 02:41:53,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know not everybody can always get through, but we try to do the emails and chat room comments.

2318
02:41:53,048 --> 02:41:59,290
[SPEAKER_05]: And we like to think, out of all the gaming podcasts out there, we're one of the more interactive ones that are out there.

2319
02:41:59,310 --> 02:42:00,791
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know there's other shows doing their thing.

2320
02:42:01,091 --> 02:42:05,313
[SPEAKER_05]: But speaking of all games and all that stuff, you know, look forward to at E3...

2321
02:42:07,017 --> 02:42:07,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2322
02:42:26,142 --> 02:42:31,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to do live E3 shows where the listeners can call in and ask us questions and all that.

2323
02:42:32,007 --> 02:42:39,193
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if without the E3X, or what do they call it, the E3 Arena this year, I don't know if that's going to be as possible.

2324
02:42:39,233 --> 02:42:40,194
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be interesting.

2325
02:42:41,174 --> 02:42:48,961
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I also saw an episode of Sessler's Soapbox a dollar a day.

2326
02:42:49,761 --> 02:42:55,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, strange enough, I didn't get it from the G4 TV set of my PSP, because get this,

2327
02:42:56,072 --> 02:42:56,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

2328
02:43:11,791 --> 02:43:17,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I don't understand why you'd want to close out one of your... Why would you want to shut the door on your listeners?

2329
02:43:17,233 --> 02:43:24,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess when you're a TV station and you have that type of money, you can make those types of decisions, but I just think it's crazy talk to close the door.

2330
02:43:24,836 --> 02:43:30,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe it was costing them too much to produce, but how much can it cost to translate a movie into PSP format?

2331
02:43:30,839 --> 02:43:31,579
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems a little silly.

2332
02:43:31,599 --> 02:43:32,319
[SPEAKER_05]: A little silly.

2333
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:39,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Fessler's Soapbox was going on about kids playing Emory games and how, you know,

2334
02:43:40,014 --> 02:43:45,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no different than some kid possibly, you know, seen in a Radar movie.

2335
02:43:45,695 --> 02:43:51,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, heck, when I was 11, I saw The Matrix and I was, you know, Radar.

2336
02:43:52,557 --> 02:43:54,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I end up doing sniping people?

2337
02:43:54,777 --> 02:43:55,037
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2338
02:43:55,718 --> 02:44:01,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Frickin' Chad Thompson, who's, well, thank God, disbarred, um...

2339
02:44:03,203 --> 02:44:04,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Music is head screwed up straight.

2340
02:44:05,905 --> 02:44:06,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2341
02:44:06,426 --> 02:44:13,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, these guys run with the one bad apple that ruins it for the rest of us normal people.

2342
02:44:13,372 --> 02:44:13,832
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

2343
02:44:15,394 --> 02:44:23,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because of that, the only other way I was able to get my hands on GTA LCS was on Amazon with my debit card.

2344
02:44:24,061 --> 02:44:25,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have one.

2345
02:44:26,120 --> 02:44:30,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have a job, but now I'm dead broke with only $1.20 in my account.

2346
02:44:30,804 --> 02:44:32,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have enough to pay taxes.

2347
02:44:32,486 --> 02:44:33,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so screwed.

2348
02:44:34,507 --> 02:44:35,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

2349
02:44:35,028 --> 02:44:37,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting to get a little depressing.

2350
02:44:37,270 --> 02:44:37,510
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2351
02:44:38,371 --> 02:44:42,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, is there anything else you wanted to comment on before we try to get some more calls?

2352
02:44:44,516 --> 02:44:44,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2353
02:44:45,116 --> 02:44:49,860
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I kind of listened back to episode 312 and what Dan said.

2354
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:51,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I went over to GameStop and whatever.

2355
02:44:51,682 --> 02:44:52,923
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like,

2356
02:44:53,633 --> 02:44:56,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, we still can't give you a replacement or whatever.

2357
02:44:57,295 --> 02:45:07,361
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, basically, I don't know what else to go at here other than spend $20 on a faceplate and whatever and replace next.

2358
02:45:07,421 --> 02:45:08,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that might be the issue.

2359
02:45:10,243 --> 02:45:13,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be what you're going to have to do at this point.

2360
02:45:13,525 --> 02:45:15,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you using it in the shower?

2361
02:45:16,096 --> 02:45:16,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Prioritize.

2362
02:45:16,836 --> 02:45:17,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Prioritize.

2363
02:45:17,296 --> 02:45:17,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Prioritize.

2364
02:45:41,843 --> 02:45:54,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I spent a bunch of money on my prom date with my girlfriend who also plays Destroy All Humans and says that's better than GTA because she says flying saucers are better than tanks, but I don't know.

2365
02:45:54,848 --> 02:45:55,789
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your view on that?

2366
02:45:56,549 --> 02:45:57,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Prioritize.

2367
02:46:00,230 --> 02:46:06,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Since I've been a prom date before, I wouldn't have wanted a whole lot of money spent on me if it was at the expense of someone being able to pay their bills.

2368
02:46:09,210 --> 02:46:12,612
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's all going to be worth it because we're going to be watching Twilight.

2369
02:46:14,412 --> 02:46:14,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2370
02:46:14,992 --> 02:46:16,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, DS Master, we've got to let you go.

2371
02:46:16,393 --> 02:46:18,694
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to get some more calls before we end up.

2372
02:46:18,714 --> 02:46:21,155
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you so much for your call, and good luck with the monies.

2373
02:46:21,375 --> 02:46:24,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a tight time for a lot of people right now, but things will work out.

2374
02:46:24,556 --> 02:46:25,456
[SPEAKER_06]: They always do.

2375
02:46:25,916 --> 02:46:26,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, good luck, buddy.

2376
02:46:27,277 --> 02:46:29,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace out, and keep rocking the show.

2377
02:46:29,178 --> 02:46:29,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll try.

2378
02:46:29,998 --> 02:46:30,258
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

2379
02:46:31,055 --> 02:46:34,656
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll probably take like one more call on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2380
02:46:34,776 --> 02:46:40,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to read some comments that were in chat, and now I can't find them.

2381
02:46:40,898 --> 02:46:41,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Darn it.

2382
02:46:41,898 --> 02:46:42,979
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little while ago.

2383
02:46:44,039 --> 02:46:46,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, SSJ100Matt says, OLR was the first show to use Skype.

2384
02:46:47,100 --> 02:46:51,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I still believe to this day that that is true, that we were, but nobody probably believes me.

2385
02:46:51,682 --> 02:46:52,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we got one more call.

2386
02:46:52,722 --> 02:46:54,442
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take it, and then we're going to wrap up the show.

2387
02:46:54,502 --> 02:46:55,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2388
02:46:55,503 --> 02:46:55,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2389
02:46:56,727 --> 02:46:57,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Deathwishing.

2390
02:46:57,648 --> 02:46:58,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Deathwishing.

2391
02:46:58,408 --> 02:46:58,929
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

2392
02:47:00,010 --> 02:47:03,092
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'd like to say no more cock jokes, DarkSakura.

2393
02:47:03,112 --> 02:47:05,674
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a whole chat storm of cock jokes, and it was very...

2394
02:47:07,501 --> 02:47:07,801
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2395
02:47:08,041 --> 02:47:17,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, that happens sometimes, is that one funny thing is said and the chat just won't let it die, but that's just part of the... It's a revival of the old Big Black Cock.

2396
02:47:18,387 --> 02:47:18,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

2397
02:47:19,407 --> 02:47:20,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Charm?

2398
02:47:20,768 --> 02:47:21,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2399
02:47:22,169 --> 02:47:22,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I forget it.

2400
02:47:22,729 --> 02:47:23,710
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you call in about tonight?

2401
02:47:25,331 --> 02:47:27,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to comment on the Guitar Hero, you know.

2402
02:47:28,172 --> 02:47:29,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap, there's a lot of them.

2403
02:47:30,892 --> 02:47:32,233
[SPEAKER_05]: For real, right?

2404
02:47:32,893 --> 02:47:36,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear earlier when we were saying can you hear the milking of the franchise?

2405
02:47:36,435 --> 02:47:42,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally call it, you know the weird 30-year-old guy that stays in his mom's basement and has an addiction to porn?

2406
02:47:42,877 --> 02:47:44,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much he's running out of Vaseline.

2407
02:47:44,618 --> 02:47:46,839
[SPEAKER_05]: You better watch it because I've got two of those three.

2408
02:47:46,899 --> 02:47:48,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm 30 years old and addicted to porn.

2409
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:50,361
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you live with your mom?

2410
02:47:50,441 --> 02:47:51,341
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't, thankfully.

2411
02:47:51,601 --> 02:47:52,282
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.

2412
02:47:55,563 --> 02:47:57,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, so what about the guys that live with their mom?

2413
02:47:58,384 --> 02:47:59,885
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the guys that are going to be buying the games?

2414
02:48:00,618 --> 02:48:02,679
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I'm just saying that's like an example.

2415
02:48:02,779 --> 02:48:04,460
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an example of what they're doing to it.

2416
02:48:05,401 --> 02:48:09,263
[SPEAKER_04]: My problem is that the Guitar Hero games aren't exactly the same as like Rock Band.

2417
02:48:09,283 --> 02:48:16,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas Rock Band, say for example, someone was actually doing a comparison with the amount of games that Rock Band releases.

2418
02:48:16,367 --> 02:48:22,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, the games that they release, like the track packs or whatever, it's just download content that's available now on disc.

2419
02:48:22,910 --> 02:48:24,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something that you necessarily need to buy.

2420
02:48:24,911 --> 02:48:27,233
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nothing new unless you don't have internet.

2421
02:48:27,853 --> 02:48:34,697
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Guitar Hero games, they're all these different new tracks that you can't dump together.

2422
02:48:34,917 --> 02:48:40,220
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to buy all these games, and each one has to be played separate, and that's retarded.

2423
02:48:40,801 --> 02:48:46,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one thing I really like about Rock Band 2 as well, is that it seems like the developers of Rock Band are continuing to add to Rock Band 2.

2424
02:48:46,764 --> 02:48:51,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, yeah, you got the ACDC game, but they didn't really bother to promote that that much.

2425
02:48:51,167 --> 02:48:54,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just kind of a one-off thing, like, hey, this is out there, you can get this.

2426
02:48:54,189 --> 02:48:54,529
[SPEAKER_05]: You want it?

2427
02:48:54,589 --> 02:48:54,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get it.

2428
02:48:54,989 --> 02:48:58,072
[SPEAKER_05]: And then everything is pouring into Rock Band 2.

2429
02:48:58,112 --> 02:49:00,434
[SPEAKER_05]: They have all this regular content and so on and so on.

2430
02:49:00,755 --> 02:49:04,478
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure, okay, the Beatles game is going to be a completely separate game.

2431
02:49:04,678 --> 02:49:05,839
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the fucking Beatles.

2432
02:49:05,859 --> 02:49:06,420
[SPEAKER_05]: They're allowed.

2433
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:08,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and that's the deal that they had.

2434
02:49:08,502 --> 02:49:14,668
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have done it as a Rock Band track pack, but the people that have the Beatles license, they're like, uh, no.

2435
02:49:14,868 --> 02:49:16,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, again, it's the Beatles.

2436
02:49:16,550 --> 02:49:17,110
[SPEAKER_05]: They're allowed.

2437
02:49:17,250 --> 02:49:18,752
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot of bands I'd say that for.

2438
02:49:20,509 --> 02:49:21,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2439
02:49:41,678 --> 02:49:45,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's all these games, all these artist-specific games.

2440
02:49:45,939 --> 02:49:53,501
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, it sounds very risky because not everyone loves Metallica, not everyone loves Van Halen, not everyone loves Aerosmith.

2441
02:49:53,601 --> 02:49:55,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate Smith.

2442
02:49:55,641 --> 02:50:01,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing, too, they're all, well, you get 40-some tracks for $60 or whatever, that's a great deal.

2443
02:50:02,062 --> 02:50:03,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I might not want all those tracks.

2444
02:50:03,823 --> 02:50:06,123
[SPEAKER_04]: At least with Rock Band, I can pick and choose what I want.

2445
02:50:07,644 --> 02:50:08,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I love Rock Band.

2446
02:50:10,562 --> 02:50:26,094
[SPEAKER_05]: from a gamer standpoint right now somebody who's been playing music games for about 10 years now I definitely prefer Rock Band to Guitar Hero at this point in time for these reasons that we've been stating it's just a better package to me

2447
02:50:27,615 --> 02:50:33,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus, also consider this, the Guitar Hero on tour, the DS one, eh, you know, what are they trying to do with that?

2448
02:50:33,421 --> 02:50:35,343
[SPEAKER_03]: The DS one gives you carpal tunnel.

2449
02:50:35,363 --> 02:50:40,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and they're trying to condense the guitar playing experience into the DS, which just doesn't really work.

2450
02:50:40,147 --> 02:50:46,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, those DS games, they're about as different with each other as, unfortunately, the guitar-freeze games in the arcades.

2451
02:50:46,253 --> 02:50:50,918
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically trackless update, trackless update, let's reskin it a little bit, done.

2452
02:50:51,058 --> 02:50:52,280
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2453
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:10,304
[SPEAKER_05]: No stupid peripheral to plug in my PSP, just making music in a way that's just different.

2454
02:51:11,205 --> 02:51:12,746
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds great.

2455
02:51:13,026 --> 02:51:15,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's a thought.

2456
02:51:16,189 --> 02:51:17,030
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be kind of cool.

2457
02:51:17,390 --> 02:51:29,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine if they were to do a game like that for, say, the 360 or whatever, and the PS3 kind of like this amplitude rock band thing, but it took all the music that you downloaded from rock band and allowed you to use that?

2458
02:51:30,612 --> 02:51:32,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Jizz in my pants

2459
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:47,121
[SPEAKER_05]: AudioSurf AudioSurf

2460
02:52:15,819 --> 02:52:19,482
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, hey, any other final thoughts before we get on out of here and wrap up the show?

2461
02:52:19,502 --> 02:52:23,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to UCLA, and they have two Street Fighter cabinets, four cabinets there.

2462
02:52:24,507 --> 02:52:25,728
[SPEAKER_03]: At UCLA, really?

2463
02:52:26,169 --> 02:52:26,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2464
02:52:26,609 --> 02:52:27,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Big scene there?

2465
02:52:27,670 --> 02:52:28,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Were they busy?

2466
02:52:29,271 --> 02:52:32,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I went there when it was lunch because I'm not that old.

2467
02:52:32,154 --> 02:52:32,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only 16.

2468
02:52:32,554 --> 02:52:34,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I went on a field trip there.

2469
02:52:34,937 --> 02:52:38,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was, like, it was lunchtime.

2470
02:52:38,460 --> 02:52:39,100
[SPEAKER_03]: There was about, like...

2471
02:52:39,963 --> 02:52:41,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade Infinity Arcade Infinity

2472
02:53:00,018 --> 02:53:28,532
[SPEAKER_05]: it's out in City of Industry and actually we've back in the day when we were much more into the DDR and Beatmania we would drive all the way from Sacramento where we're based to go to this arcade to play some of the legendary games I think it was the Gundam game that was epic there was just so many epic games I haven't been there in a long time but I imagine they've got quite a crowd of people too around these fighting games so you know there's definitely an audience for it the only arcades I ever really went to were like I think the Sega one I knew near me

2473
02:53:29,572 --> 02:53:30,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, GameWorks.

2474
02:53:30,293 --> 02:53:31,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Which has gone now.

2475
02:53:31,114 --> 02:53:31,834
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's all Sega.

2476
02:53:31,874 --> 02:53:34,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all Sega, but then it got turned into GameWorks, I think.

2477
02:53:35,237 --> 02:53:37,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, because I knew that GameWorks was a Sega arcade.

2478
02:53:37,919 --> 02:53:39,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I know what he's talking about.

2479
02:53:39,921 --> 02:53:41,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

2480
02:53:41,102 --> 02:53:42,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have been there once, but anyway.

2481
02:53:42,403 --> 02:53:45,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It had this awesome helicopter game where you rolled around and stuff.

2482
02:53:45,766 --> 02:53:46,327
[SPEAKER_08]: The Sega 360.

2483
02:53:47,448 --> 02:53:48,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the Tatsu?

2484
02:53:49,349 --> 02:53:50,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that a Sega thing?

2485
02:53:50,090 --> 02:53:51,211
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the Sega 360.

2486
02:53:51,371 --> 02:53:51,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it?

2487
02:53:51,931 --> 02:53:54,253
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot better than the Tatsu thing.

2488
02:53:54,754 --> 02:53:55,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

2489
02:53:55,114 --> 02:53:55,875
[SPEAKER_03]: A little different.

2490
02:53:56,550 --> 02:53:58,511
[SPEAKER_03]: But arcades are pretty much dead now.

2491
02:53:59,051 --> 02:54:04,034
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sad because, you know, all the online gaming has really put a dent in it.

2492
02:54:04,174 --> 02:54:06,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take something epic to bring people back.

2493
02:54:06,156 --> 02:54:06,636
[SPEAKER_05]: But who knows?

2494
02:54:06,736 --> 02:54:07,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe when the recession wraps up.

2495
02:54:08,017 --> 02:54:09,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a way to bring back arcades.

2496
02:54:09,738 --> 02:54:10,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick, what is it?

2497
02:54:11,218 --> 02:54:11,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Boobs.

2498
02:54:15,221 --> 02:54:16,061
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

2499
02:54:16,101 --> 02:54:18,342
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Deathwishing, we've got to let you go to wrap up this show.

2500
02:54:18,663 --> 02:54:20,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck on your quest for boobs in arcades.

2501
02:54:21,963 --> 02:54:22,223
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2502
02:54:22,924 --> 02:54:23,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be a millionaire one day.

2503
02:54:23,984 --> 02:54:24,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Just watch.

2504
02:54:24,565 --> 02:54:24,905
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2505
02:54:25,525 --> 02:54:26,406
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard it here first.

2506
02:54:26,526 --> 02:54:26,806
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2507
02:54:27,467 --> 02:54:28,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

2508
02:54:28,807 --> 02:54:29,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2509
02:54:30,749 --> 02:54:37,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if anybody's thought about trying that, like mixing a strip club with an arcade with, I don't know, maybe there's local laws.

2510
02:54:37,113 --> 02:54:37,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I approve.

2511
02:54:37,673 --> 02:54:37,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2512
02:54:39,454 --> 02:54:42,696
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, that's just a strip club with an arcade in it.

2513
02:54:42,736 --> 02:54:44,898
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, though, is you really want, I mean...

2514
02:54:46,019 --> 02:54:54,864
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want arcade games in a strip club because one, you have to pay money to get into a strip club and two, it takes away from the time that the strippers have with you so they can't get paid.

2515
02:54:55,765 --> 02:54:58,907
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you got a lap dance while playing Street Fighter 4?

2516
02:54:59,027 --> 02:54:59,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be distracting.

2517
02:54:59,807 --> 02:55:00,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be a little distracting.

2518
02:55:02,248 --> 02:55:02,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried.

2519
02:55:03,549 --> 02:55:06,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to take a minute to wrap up the show here.

2520
02:55:06,671 --> 02:55:10,573
[SPEAKER_04]: But a strip club with video game themes, that could be doable.

2521
02:55:11,914 --> 02:55:14,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Or video games and anime themes, that could be doable.

2522
02:55:16,249 --> 02:55:17,830
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like a bad convention.

2523
02:55:17,930 --> 02:55:19,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a cosplay strip club.

2524
02:55:20,291 --> 02:55:22,072
[SPEAKER_04]: But not with nasty looking chicks.

2525
02:55:22,112 --> 02:55:27,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like when Consumer Electronics Show is going on at the same time as the adult video convention?

2526
02:55:27,695 --> 02:55:28,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that, yeah.

2527
02:55:28,516 --> 02:55:29,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember they just need to combine them into one?

2528
02:55:31,798 --> 02:55:33,259
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we've got to wrap up the show.

2529
02:55:33,299 --> 02:55:34,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough silly talk.

2530
02:55:34,060 --> 02:55:35,021
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to wrap up the show.

2531
02:55:35,061 --> 02:55:36,863
[SPEAKER_05]: We were running a little long tonight, which is fine.

2532
02:55:36,883 --> 02:55:38,684
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a good show, a lot of good discussion tonight.

2533
02:55:39,245 --> 02:55:40,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was a good show.

2534
02:55:40,226 --> 02:55:42,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Good calls, good discussion, good chat.

2535
02:55:42,448 --> 02:55:45,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling good about tonight's show, so thank you all for making it a success.

2536
02:55:45,470 --> 02:55:48,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's any more last-minute stories, right, Loki?

2537
02:55:48,393 --> 02:55:49,354
[SPEAKER_05]: You said you had them all wrapped up.

2538
02:55:49,374 --> 02:55:52,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's some Guitar Hero stuff coming out this month, including Queen.

2539
02:55:53,498 --> 02:55:55,800
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we'll download tracks, including Queen.

2540
02:55:56,380 --> 02:55:57,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, that is epic.

2541
02:55:57,601 --> 02:55:59,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I will premise a story for Queen.

2542
02:55:59,863 --> 02:56:07,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there's some interesting songs, including, I'm trying to think what they were now, as I pull this up.

2543
02:56:08,051 --> 02:56:11,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Killer Queen was one of them, which is interesting.

2544
02:56:11,935 --> 02:56:14,757
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see here.

2545
02:56:15,138 --> 02:56:18,781
[SPEAKER_04]: It was nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody or anything cool like that, unfortunately.

2546
02:56:20,403 --> 02:56:21,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go, here we go.

2547
02:56:50,168 --> 02:56:56,813
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Killer Queen, which is going to be part of the Queen Track Pack.

2548
02:56:57,134 --> 02:56:58,275
[SPEAKER_04]: We Are The Champions.

2549
02:56:59,135 --> 02:57:00,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, Killer Queen isn't in that.

2550
02:57:00,636 --> 02:57:04,500
[SPEAKER_04]: It's We Are The Champions, Fat Bottom Girls, and Sea Liberty.

2551
02:57:05,160 --> 02:57:08,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are all going to be available in the Queen Track Pack on March 26th.

2552
02:57:09,023 --> 02:57:14,608
[SPEAKER_04]: The week before that, they're going to have the Jimi Hendrix Track Pack with Freedom, Angel, and Foxy Lady, the live version.

2553
02:57:14,748 --> 02:57:15,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

2554
02:57:15,569 --> 02:57:16,830
[SPEAKER_04]: On March 19th.

2555
02:57:16,910 --> 02:57:19,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Also available March 19th would be the European Track Pack.

2556
02:57:19,972 --> 02:57:21,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if these were available in Europe.

2557
02:57:21,873 --> 02:57:23,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it might be just European bands.

2558
02:57:24,354 --> 02:57:36,001
[SPEAKER_04]: With What Have You Done by Within Temptation, I Are Comet Alex by Dai Toten Hosen, and Carolina by M-Klan.

2559
02:57:36,461 --> 02:57:44,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, available last week, Break It Out by Vanilla Sky, In The Shadows by Rasmus, and C.S.

2560
02:57:44,626 --> 02:57:45,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Comey's

2561
02:57:46,947 --> 02:57:51,068
[SPEAKER_04]: by Lesrita Mitsuko.

2562
02:57:51,248 --> 02:57:51,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2563
02:57:51,648 --> 02:57:53,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I butchered that last name.

2564
02:57:54,009 --> 02:57:55,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Mitsuko.

2565
02:57:55,490 --> 02:57:55,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2566
02:57:56,870 --> 02:57:57,170
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2567
02:57:58,351 --> 02:57:58,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2568
02:57:58,671 --> 02:57:59,331
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to wrap up.

2569
02:57:59,451 --> 02:58:03,112
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get all the closing thoughts and wrap on out of here for tonight.

2570
02:58:03,392 --> 02:58:04,633
[SPEAKER_05]: We are running a little long tonight.

2571
02:58:04,793 --> 02:58:06,434
[SPEAKER_05]: The show is very, very long, but that's all right.

2572
02:58:06,454 --> 02:58:06,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good show.

2573
02:58:07,494 --> 02:58:09,134
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight.

2574
02:58:09,295 --> 02:58:10,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday, Chris.

2575
02:58:11,368 --> 02:58:11,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree!

2576
02:58:11,829 --> 02:58:12,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, Chris!

2577
02:58:13,210 --> 02:58:14,051
[SPEAKER_05]: How dare I not say anything?

2578
02:58:14,071 --> 02:58:17,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I left her a message on Facebook earlier, but, you know, just got sidetracked with the show.

2579
02:58:18,355 --> 02:58:20,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, happy birthday, Chris, one of the OLR lesbians.

2580
02:58:22,058 --> 02:58:27,484
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought would be I am craving Pringles.

2581
02:58:29,265 --> 02:58:33,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, this isn't a G4 show back in the day that were all sponsored by Pringles, but I really am craving Pringles.

2582
02:58:34,070 --> 02:58:34,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

2583
02:58:36,118 --> 02:58:37,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not craving Pringles.

2584
02:58:37,959 --> 02:58:38,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Pringles are nasty.

2585
02:58:38,979 --> 02:58:39,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Pringles are not nasty.

2586
02:58:39,839 --> 02:58:40,660
[SPEAKER_04]: You're nasty.

2587
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:42,400
[SPEAKER_05]: We're done.

2588
02:58:42,480 --> 02:58:43,041
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out of here.

2589
02:58:43,121 --> 02:58:43,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great week.

[SPEAKER_05]: and that's all we ask.
