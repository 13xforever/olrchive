13985	24528	Tonight, March 1st, 2009, the R4 DS card gets smacked down in Japan, Cooking Mama is ready to fix it on your iPhone, and could a remake of Silent Hill be made for the Wii?
31325	36067	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36107	42711	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42811	48314	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48734	49294	I have beef.
50075	51015	Congratulations.
52036	55958	Hopefully you don't get E. coli or any of the mad cow disease or anything like that.
55978	56078	No!
58120	58500	How are you?
58520	58640	Beefy!
58660	58760	Beefy!
81388	85832	You're listening to Cheeseburger Radio where you can have all the time.
85852	88695	I have a cheese pizza because I haven't eaten anything all day long.
88895	89596	All day long?
89836	91117	Yeah, because I was busy.
91257	94220	I woke up early because Nathan had to call me early to...
94810	100054	GoToFries, and we were building a computer all day, and I didn't have a chance to stop and eat something.
100074	102916	So you got rained out for your thing once again, didn't you?
103156	105438	And next week, and the week after next.
106118	108840	Yeah, don't get me started on that.
109681	115705	It's funny because it'll be clear all fucking week long, and then Sunday, POUR!
116966	123691	You look at the weather for next week, it's the same way, except it's pouring all week, and then it has a break, and then pouring some more on Sunday.
123711	123791	Okay.
123971	125712	At least it's not snowing here.
125832	129314	On my Twitter today, all my friends on the East Coast are like, OMG snow, OMG snow.
129354	130594	It's snowing in Alabama.
130614	132756	It's snowing all over the Southeast.
132876	133116	What?
133136	135157	I have to tell you something else really cool.
135177	137018	I had cheeseburgers for breakfast, too.
138817	139177	Denny's, Denny's
155814	158675	Who's very excited, saying, yay, Cheeseburger Radio.
159716	164758	We also like to broadcast the show on Justin.TV, which you can see as we're taping live on Sunday nights as well.
165078	166858	Justin.TV slash Orange Lounge Radio.
167098	170240	Although people are supposed to be clipping parts of the show, making clips for us.
170480	172521	So I can put them on YouTube, but there's like one clip.
172781	175302	But I want to show this on Justin.TV, so I apologize.
175322	177082	This is going to be horrible radio.
177162	180004	But DarkSakura, talk about the donations you've made to the studios.
182045	184566	Dan and I are doing uber cleaning.
184786	186847	This is like spring cleaning for the millennium.
187668	195072	And we found a bunch of our old posters and wall scrolls and some of them are kind of smashed but I don't think Rob cares about smashed posters on the wall.
195993	202036	So I decided to donate a number of our posters that we were just going to get rid of.
202276	203696	It's hard to see on the TV, anyway.
203796	205497	To the wall.
205937	209498	Not only that wall, but the other wall, and probably that wall, too.
210138	211658	And the ceiling, maybe.
211938	212378	Who knows?
212478	214019	We might be able to really decorate in here.
214039	215039	I'm sure our landlords will love that.
215059	218220	But I wanted to show this one in particular, because this is one of the coolest donations, I think.
218500	221081	And a lot of our longtime fans are going to get a kick out of this.
221441	222621	But tell them what I'm opening up right now.
223503	230068	Rob is opening up a DDR second mix marquee, which I have had for quite some time.
230248	233270	And that's like an actual, like used in a machine type thing.
233290	235511	And if you put tacks in that thing, I will shoot you.
236172	237613	Alright, then I can't put tacks in it.
237873	238834	You can use sticky tacks.
238874	239654	I'll figure something out.
239674	244277	But look at that, there's even an official Konami seal there in the corner that shows you it's the real deal.
244417	245298	It means nothing!
247690	250171	I don't think they really pirated second mix, though.
250371	252612	No, that one actually is a legit second mix marquee.
253192	255793	So, it's my baby.
255933	259614	It was going to go in the vault, but now the vault is completely empty.
260714	262195	I have the metal thing from the machine.
262235	264415	I don't remember the faceplate or whatever.
265176	266596	I never did use that for anything.
267756	268597	But it's around somewhere.
268737	269257	Bring it on over.
269297	270037	We'll put it in studio.
270057	274719	But what would the listeners be most excited about that you're planning to do with some of your stuff, Dark Sakura?
274879	275599	Well, um...
277232	277857	I don't know yet.
277897	279349	It's not really official, Rob.
280217	280637	Oh, sorry.
280857	281737	Then I won't say anything else.
281757	282578	Well, I'll say something.
282758	282978	Okay.
283378	284418	Burn it on air!
284978	287619	Yes, we're going to burn some of it live on air.
287819	292700	Well, as I'm sure our listeners know, Dan and I have a whole lot of shit.
293400	295601	A lot of stuff, really.
296321	307604	And because we're going to be thinning out the collection, some of it, I'm thinking that some of the neater things that we just won't be able to eBay or anything, I might make a big grab bag for Who Wants My Shit?
309187	317931	So if anyone is interested in that, then quick, quick vote in the chat room, wire in or fire.
318671	319772	Who wants my shit?
321412	322453	I hope fire wins.
322973	329096	And I'm talking leftover stuff like Hello Kitty stationery from six years ago.
329896	330296	Awesome.
330877	333878	And Rurouni Kenshin stationery from eight years ago.
334554	335798	Who Wants Jamie's Crap?
341341	342802	I see a lot of Ys popping up in chat.
342922	343483	People want your shit.
343503	344423	God, you want my crap.
344504	345825	Actdeft, I want your shit.
346105	347707	Misty wants your shit.
348107	350709	Old E3 swag, you know, just crap.
350929	353592	So DJ Ranma S wants to know, where's the whiteboard?
354653	355674	The whiteboard is here.
355794	358236	It's down for repairs before we remodel the studio.
358256	361299	I used it for a side project on Thursday, and I need to clean it up.
361319	362280	Rob used it for Big Brother.
362660	362921	I did.
362961	364202	I used it for the Big Brother game.
364222	365062	I was just guessing.
365103	365583	That's great.
365924	369813	I actually did on my own personal J... I don't know if I want to give out the link.
369853	370995	I'll put it out in chat or something.
371015	374503	But on my own personal JTV channel you can see the whiteboard being used earlier this week.
375145	375506	There you go.
376465	377946	DarkSakura did, and some of us were...
405959	407119	I mean, the venue was really nice.
407660	409340	We went to the Fox Theater in Oakland.
409680	410741	It was a pretty venue.
410761	413022	I was taking pictures of the freaking architecture.
413062	414042	Is it a new venue?
414102	415683	I'd never seen anything there before.
415703	416283	They're remodeling it.
416963	417383	Oh, okay.
417443	417823	That makes sense.
417843	418464	It's fairly old.
418524	419964	It's the Fox Theater in Oakland.
420865	421325	Oh, okay.
421425	421985	On Telegraph.
422506	422886	Gotcha.
423326	430170	Well, yeah, we went to Video Games Live, and we had Tommy on the show probably about, what, nine months ago?
430230	432791	Tommy Tallarico, the guy that is really the mastermind behind it.
432811	434092	Long enough to have a baby!
434272	437673	Yeah, he talked for a long time when he was on the show.
438394	443956	But no, we really got some insight as to what was going on, so we finally got to check it out, because the show's been going for, what, three, four years?
444597	446998	I never had a chance to check it out, and Bobby reminded me,
447538	450740	Bobby Blackwolf is the show that's on before us on All Games Radio when we tape live.
451681	460107	Bobby reminded me that I had been hazing Pong as one of the selections for inclusion in video games live.
460147	461087	And actually, it works.
462028	462808	I can eat my words.
462989	463429	It works.
463949	470233	The whole classic game medley thing was actually one of my favorite pieces they did because it did time the music very well when it was on the screen.
470273	471855	I, in turn, will stay...
475371	476791	You need to see it, though, Loki.
476851	478292	It's like for five seconds.
478392	479272	It's not even that bad.
479392	481633	I say that the Pong idea is stupid.
481853	482853	It was fantastic.
482933	486274	I go on the record saying it's retarded and not fantastic in any way.
486294	487294	Yeah, but your opinion doesn't count.
487314	488354	You're just an asshole.
488634	488894	All right.
489815	491475	No, actually, it was good, though.
491495	493856	The whole classic game medley was actually one of my favorite pieces that they did.
493896	494856	It was a good way to start the show.
494876	499377	I want my medley of that trick, you know, the buzzing from the screen.
499397	499477	Okay.
500157	502878	Well, they did have some really random stuff in there.
502918	504278	Like, they had this... Rastan!
504638	506459	Well, that... No, but I'm talking about some of the pieces.
506479	509280	They did the interactive Space Invaders thing last night.
509460	510320	That was fun!
510420	522064	They had a guy get up on stage, and he would run to the left, and the ship would move left, and he'd run to the right, the ship would move right, but you can tell it's just some dude in the back with a joystick moving it in the direction that the guy's running, because there's a huge, massive lag.
522264	526045	But no matter what he did, the Space Invaders destroyed the two...
526785	527885	and World Trade Center.
528406	529086	Shut up.
529606	535688	But he didn't win because Tommy was yelling, shoot the sides, you idiot, shoot the sides.
535708	537248	Not like that, but he's yelling, shoot the sides.
537568	538749	And the guy didn't figure out how to do it.
538989	543010	But I was thinking to myself, I was like, you know, there's really not a lot of music in Space Invaders.
543530	547051	It's literally three notes that the orchestra is playing faster.
547311	553233	Okay, sorry, four notes that the orchestra is playing faster and faster with one person assigned to be the UFO.
553333	553933	Beep, beep, beep.
554313	556274	I think the chorus was singing with it though
577783	580224	That whole thing is more like a night at the orchestra.
580324	591931	Granted, there's a little more clapping and cheering and interactivity, but if video game's live, Tommy just comes right out and says, you just scream right along, you cheer for your favorite stuff, we just want everybody to have fun.
592271	595773	So you can tell right off the bat they're going for a totally different type of setup.
595793	596473	Did anyone go, what?
596673	596853	Woo!
596913	597914	Intermission!
598414	599435	My favorite part!
599535	601376	No, I don't think anyone cheered for the intermission.
601396	602857	There was applause for the intermission.
602877	603458	Was there?
603498	605039	There was applause for the intermission.
605059	606720	Well, because they had like a loading screen, which was really funny.
606740	607560	I know, that was cool.
607580	608061	That was funny.
608521	614445	I liked that they had before the show and during the intermission, they would have little YouTubes, like that Ms.
614465	621109	Pac-Man for Reels thing, and some of these things would show up randomly during the usually dead parts, and it was cool.
621570	622810	Okay, so I had a good time.
622830	626353	It was like a mini convention, and obviously a lot of the arrangements were beautiful.
627013	629574	I forgot just how awesome the music is in Civ 4.
629774	633256	I'm so happy they included that piece because Civilization 4 was amazing.
633356	635016	The singer was very nervous.
635337	636497	The singer was very nervous.
636937	638658	But he did a good job.
638718	641179	He's got a gorgeous voice.
641359	641999	Oh yeah.
642019	642760	The God of War.
643260	644960	Not a series I've ever really been into.
645301	646081	Her voice was impressive.
646161	646701	Amazing.
646761	648022	Her voice was amazing.
648042	650223	Until he makes me want to play that game now.
650383	653944	The Metroid thing gave me a huge fan boner, obviously, if you've listened to the show long enough.
654044	655305	The Sonic thing kind of wasn't mine.
656365	657005	Thanks for watching!
671122	672363	Crono Trigger, Crono Cross
693560	696704	and the first guy gets up and goes, for the Horde!
696744	698045	And there's people, ah!
698065	698906	Everybody's cheering.
699027	700128	And then, for the Alliance!
700969	701710	Boo!
702030	703032	Our area was booing.
703112	703713	It was amazing.
704914	706316	Okay, parts I didn't like.
706356	707718	And Jamie disagrees with me on this.
707798	708339	Here's the thing.
709600	712241	When I say I didn't like it, this is like constructive criticism.
712341	713761	Overall, I thought the show was great.
713841	714441	I had a good time.
714501	715141	I enjoyed myself.
715281	724563	But if there's one thing I could have replaced with something else, because he goes up there and he says, hey, we have like 60 things we could choose from, and it's really hard to pick 20 that we can do here at night.
724623	730044	So my suggestion, lose the Guitar Hero Aerosmith thing, because it didn't fit to me.
730084	731664	It did not fit with the rest of the night.
731684	733944	And yes, I understand Guitar Hero is a video game too, blah, blah, blah.
733964	736805	And yes, we understand Tommy Tallarico is related to...
738406	739426	But here's the thing.
739947	742849	I didn't go to Video Games Live to hear Sweet Emotion.
743229	743689	You know what I mean?
743709	744470	Dude, I sure did.
745770	747532	It just was not what I wanted to hear.
747912	752595	It felt like I could watch a dude play Guitar Hero any day of the week on YouTube or any of that stuff.
752635	754897	I just didn't care for that.
755177	761201	And then when I go online and see, oh, I could have heard Bioshock, and instead they gave me that, I was a little disappointed.
761261	766244	I understand they wanted to give more stuff away, do another interactive cheer, cheer, cheer thing, but for me, it didn't work.
766624	767145	I didn't like it.
767725	772527	I think the best thing to have done with that would be to have brought the guy out and said, here, here's your prize.
772767	773847	This is the dude that won!
774487	774948	Yay!
775268	775688	Bye!
776048	784271	And maybe I would even go for like a music game tribute that does like Guitar Hero and Rock Band little pieces of the songs or something.
784791	786672	You know, maybe even incorporate some DDR.
786732	787132	I don't know.
787652	788692	There could be a cool Space Channel 5.
791453	796195	Okay, when they said that they were about to do a tribute to the Sega game, was I the only one that yelled out Space Channel 5?
799434	800475	We all knew it would be Sonic.
816881	820964	I'm like, I don't have to use the subtitles.
821364	822204	I'll tell you what, though.
823005	829329	What I did, I had a fun time with this part was when he came out with the guitar before the Chrono Trigger bit.
830369	833151	And like, so what do you, so, you know, we're going to hear both of this.
833191	835212	It's like, play some Skinner, man.
835232	836933	And I was like, Freebird.
837033	839875	Yeah, the minute he came out with his guitar, everybody started yelling Freebird.
840255	841656	He's like, I'm not going to play Freebird.
842639	845201	And then after the song was over, he says, okay, now I'm going to play Freebird.
846701	851464	Actually, there was somebody in our section that called for Sweet Emotion.
852445	853485	No, called for Dream On.
853565	853926	That was it.
854006	854366	Really?
854966	856147	See, somebody else knew, I guess.
856387	860029	BlackWolsonChat right now says, I've got the Video Games Live Chrono Trigger song up on YouTube.
860089	860950	This is a good arrangement.
860990	862291	Has it really hit YouTube already?
863211	865492	Dude, he said, get that on YouTube tonight.
865953	866493	That's true.
867374	868874	Now, that's what I thought was great.
869795	871076	Cameras were encouraged.
872386	874387	Video taping was encouraged.
874567	875367	It was fun.
876168	877948	There's no stick up the ass.
877968	881270	Because keep in mind, every concert is different.
881290	882190	Wow, okay, here we go.
882530	883571	Yeah, this is from last night.
883591	888713	This is from user GBPMike has put up some of the arrangement.
888753	889893	Yeah, this is from last night.
896716	899237	And you can hear everybody cheering and yelling in the back.
902413	906774	I felt really bad for the flute player She missed a note big time
925598	927800	So anyway, yeah, the flute player missed a note.
927900	929842	I think even Martin Lern missed a note at one point.
929902	930623	I heard the piano.
930643	931904	I don't know if it was him on piano.
931944	933485	I heard a bad piano note at one point.
933786	934346	I was like, don't.
934706	935767	But, you know, mistakes happen.
935808	937509	I'm not going to be like that critical.
937569	941413	That's just that's, you know, it didn't ruin the night.
941453	941653	Come on.
941673	942173	No, it didn't.
942294	943054	No, I am.
943154	944616	It ruined the night completely.
945416	947278	How dare they miss a note?
948199	949620	I come for a perfect performance.
949640	951262	It's a little different when you're the soloist.
951758	952438	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
973471	979918	You know, considering no doubt tickets are going for like 80 bucks right now, it's I guess what concert tickets are going for these days.
979998	981139	But you know what?
981219	984002	If you have the money, if you have the time, check it out when it goes to your town.
984082	992291	I wouldn't follow it around like a dead tour or anything like that, or I don't think I'd drive like a huge distance to see it, but I would definitely make it a point to see it when it comes to my town again.
993226	994507	I might actually, you know.
995068	995768	Well, it's going to be at E3.
995788	997170	I want to see different shows.
997210	1001914	They just announced, if you go to their site, they just announced like 45 new tour dates or something like that.
1002374	1008140	And they are going to be playing a show in LA on June 4th during E3.
1009221	1011583	So, it's, you know, they love to do that.
1011623	1015066	They love to kind of sync up with big nerd conventions and things of that sort.
1015967	1017508	WonderCon was this one.
1017648	1017828	Yes.
1019023	1020965	and Actdeft asked, did they play the Metal Gear Solid song?
1020985	1021486	Yes, they did.
1021546	1025890	And they even had David Hayter doing intros for each part.
1026390	1030574	And Tommy Tallarico came out in the orange box and he was hiding in the box that said orange on it.
1031995	1033477	Lots of tour dates announced for Canada.
1033717	1035439	If you're in Canada, you're very happy right now.
1035479	1039462	They're going to Saskatchewan on May 11th, Alberta, Calgary 15th, 16th, Edmonton 18th,
1043126	1068605	British Columbia the 20th and 21st all those dates in May so like they're doing a huge sweep of Canada in May and like even Winnipeg in July as well Singapore they're gonna be in Singapore Romania France in November later on this year they'll be in Portland Oregon for a couple of shows in November San Diego July 23rd New York Lewiston July 31st so they're gonna be all over later this year
1069446	1097624	so, alright, so that was our experience of video games live, otherwise, as far as my gaming week goes, personally, I didn't have a whole lot else to do with my week that was new, didn't play a lot of new stuff still the old standby favorites but I'm definitely this week going back to playing some Civ 4, I have to remember how awesome the music is this week, I was like, oh god I need to play this again, especially the video and everything, it just, it makes you all warm and tingly like a video game fan so, DarkSakura, any anything else in your gaming week besides video game live?
1098731	1122241	I actually, right before the show, when I was getting my slab of beef with two crackers on either side I was playing Raiden 2 and Marvel vs. Capcom And oh my god, I hate when an arcade machine is in such bad repair Oh god I was using the dragon though in Raiden 2, that was pretty fun
1123960	1129682	I was just going to say, speaking of arcade machines, this is going to seem completely random, but I saw a news story on this this week.
1129722	1134663	Did you hear about that they're auctioning off all the arcade games that they had at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch?
1135263	1136984	They're going to try to sell all these games.
1137524	1140524	The dude had a Hip Hop Mania machine.
1140965	1141705	He had a Sega 360.
1142731	1143351	He had one of those too.
1143411	1146493	He had a lot of different types of machines, but he actually had a Hip Hop Mania cabinet.
1146813	1147573	I kind of want it.
1148173	1151595	Like, the starting price I think was only like $400 to $600.
1151635	1153516	I'm thinking about putting a bid on it just for fun.
1153556	1153916	Do it.
1154056	1160439	Dude, wouldn't that be awesome to have a freaking Hip Hop Mania cabinet in here that was like once owned by Michael Jackson?
1160759	1161499	That would be kind of funny.
1161519	1163160	Dude, that is not auctioning off his Moonwalker.
1165141	1167362	I don't know why, but I think that's one of those random awesome things.
1167622	1169163	Dude, he had a Jumbo Safari machine.
1169983	1170744	Well, keep in mind.
1171124	1171284	Hmm.
1172159	1175361	Who was his biggest video game buddy?
1175521	1175941	Oh, Sega.
1176301	1176741	Exactly.
1176781	1177302	Absolutely.
1177722	1179303	He was in Space Channel 5 Part 2.
1180683	1181524	Shut up, Loki.
1182624	1183645	I said video game buddy.
1185506	1185786	What?
1185806	1186726	He played video games with him.
1186746	1188367	Macaulay Culkin is not a video game company.
1189808	1190528	We said buddy.
1190788	1191929	You did not specify.
1192609	1195110	TigerClaw says, I wonder, did Michael Jackson even play those games?
1195150	1195671	Probably not.
1197371	1198372	Well, maybe a couple of them.
1199540	1200740	But, um, who knows?
1201101	1204802	I doubt he played them all, but it would still be kind of cool to own a machine that was once at Neverland Ranch.
1204842	1205162	Come on.
1205562	1205902	Come on.
1206363	1207903	Who doesn't want to own a piece of history like that?
1207963	1209904	I think I'm seriously going to try to buy one of the machines.
1210424	1213866	I can't spend a lot of money, but, you know, I'll try to get something.
1213906	1214186	Why not?
1215687	1220011	DJ Ranma S in our chatroom says, if you win that arcade machine, you better check it with a black light.
1220211	1222593	They had a hip-hop media machine local.
1223054	1223574	Did they?
1224295	1226337	It was a beat media machine or something.
1226357	1230241	I sent Jamie the link to it on Twitter like a while ago.
1230541	1231142	That poor...
1232298	1233439	And it was about the same price.
1234159	1234559	Interesting.
1234819	1235840	Not from Golfland, though.
1236620	1241963	I thought for sure Roseville, you know, Hip Hop Mania, it's gotta be from Golfland, but no.
1242123	1247526	I swear to God, though, if other Bomani fans out there try to outbid me on the Hip Hop Mania machine from Neverland Ranch, I will cut you.
1248206	1253669	Anyway, Jamie, anything else with your... I can't say names right tonight.
1254089	1255229	Anything else with your gaming week?
1256350	1256430	Um...
1258797	1263900	No, City of Heroes, which my thing expired now, so I don't know if I'm going to play.
1266021	1270123	And the really stupid Flash game that I can't remember.
1270884	1274185	Oh, yeah, I played with my virtual pet on Facebook today.
1274886	1277227	I also want to say that was the worst no answer I've ever heard.
1278147	1278368	What?
1278808	1281049	Because you said, I said, is there anything else in your gaming week?
1281069	1285231	You said no, but City of Heroes and Facebook games.
1285511	1287613	Oh, Rob.
1288113	1288293	What?
1291212	1292453	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1292854	1293935	Oh, I didn't play anything.
1294516	1299040	Except for, you know, Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned.
1300582	1301843	You're a little feisty tonight, Loki.
1301903	1302144	I like this.
1302224	1304346	No, I'm getting over a cold, actually.
1304526	1304967	Again.
1305327	1306408	It's like cold the sequel.
1306448	1311173	You know, I first got sick, and then I got better, and then I got the flu, and then I got better.
1311774	1312675	But now I'm coughing again.
1314580	1317082	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1339113	1341674	And it's kind of cheesy, but I kind of like it.
1342054	1344136	It's got achievements like crazy.
1344576	1347477	For the most redundant, stupid things ever.
1347797	1350919	Like you start the game and you get an achievement immediately.
1351899	1352440	It's awesome.
1352620	1354741	You pause the game and you get an achievement.
1357382	1357742	It's great.
1358202	1362305	But then the whole game is just very...
1363485	1364025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1390373	1391053	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1406823	1407664	Thanks for watching!
1425845	1427146	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
1448314	1449274	One game at a time, right?
1471061	1472522	I might be getting a new car soon.
1472562	1474763	One of the things I did this weekend was I went car shopping.
1474783	1476523	It kept me away from video games for a little while.
1476563	1483466	And the reason why I bring that up is that if I do end up getting a car and have to factor in a car payment into my budget now, I'm probably going to have to really cut back on the amount of new video games I buy.
1483566	1488427	So I can definitely feel the pain of, you know, I don't have to get Killzone 2 just because it's new.
1488728	1491028	No, and seriously, that is the thing too.
1491208	1496490	I kind of almost feel like peer pressure based on all the advertisements and all the hype and stuff.
1496530	1497511	And when I look at it, it's like...
1498720	1500721	You know, it's just another shooter game.
1500801	1502182	Do I really need to play this?
1502402	1503082	And no, I don't.
1503422	1504963	It's the same with Star Ocean.
1505003	1505744	I was going to buy that.
1505764	1507765	I'm like, do I need to really play this right now?
1507925	1508565	No, I don't.
1509025	1514568	And the more I keep evaluating stuff like that, the less I'm buying, which is fine.
1515448	1524053	Eat Lead was one of those games that looked funny, and I wanted to play it, and I didn't really give a crap about the production value or anything of the game.
1524093	1524273	Because
1525322	1528584	You know, it's not an excellent game, but it's fun.
1529204	1531365	So that's why I decided to play that one.
1531866	1539010	And then, of course, I'm waiting for Mad World to come out because it's a lot of blood and killing, which is going to be so awesome.
1539690	1541851	Actdeft in chat jokes, Sky, you're getting a Yaris?
1542372	1543112	I'm considering it.
1543472	1545033	It's not high up on my list anymore, though.
1545093	1548755	It was before, but right now I'm torn between another Corolla and a Jetta.
1548875	1550616	Rob, if you get a Yaris, the terrorists win.
1553826	1556407	And by terrorists, I mean people that made the Yars game.
1556707	1557347	Oh, shut up.
1557928	1561029	Alright, anything else, Loki, in your gaming week?
1562489	1571813	I was actually also looking at hacking Lost and Damned, but I haven't gotten around to actually doing it yet, but I've...
1573254	1574135	and I'll see you next time.
1591718	1593839	All right, maybe you do, and that's why we put it out as a podcast.
1593879	1598862	But check it out, chat.orange.com live on Sunday nights when we tape at allgames.com.
1599902	1603024	I also wanted to show us your tweets segment.
1604045	1609147	You guys sometimes respond to our Twitter requests at username OLR on Twitter.
1609167	1615451	And just before the show, I asked, hey, Twitter, when and if Video Games Live comes to your town, what do you hope they'll play?
1615911	1616352	Thanks for watching!
1627802	1629383	I would love to hear the Wild Arms intro.
1649492	1654034	Actdeft says, when they came to Mexicali, I hoped they would play a Kirby song.
1654054	1656515	Sadly, they didn't, but Kirby plus orchestra equals awesome.
1667300	1669362	Crows says they're coming to Houston late 2009.
1669983	1673867	I want to hear a crapload of Ace Combat 5 songs and the main theme of Fallout 3.
1674747	1677110	Ooh, that makes me think Bethesda, Oblivion.
1677410	1679132	Oblivion would be an awesome one to hear.
1680213	1682435	Pigruuno says the Let's Tap theme tune.
1683175	1686358	And Harry AKA says some of the beautiful music from Braid.
1687139	1688420	That's not a bad suggestion either.
1688820	1692161	Braid had a very kind of ambient soundtrack that might be pretty awesome to hear live.
1692961	1698763	And since they're always adding new stuff, kind of shuffling it up, keeping it fresh, who knows what's going to come to that in the future.
1700524	1703445	Show us your tweets by following us on Twitter, username OLR.
1703625	1704365	You know what?
1704506	1712929	I was going to mention something that I was going to play this week, but I didn't get a chance to, and I really, really sad.
1713109	1716210	Oh, I also play more Nomi Nobi Boy, and I still don't get any, you know...
1717074	1718057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1727009	1728570	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1750267	1750828	Thanks for watching!
1768243	1773326	Yeah, so they have all of them, including the levels where you're inside the bases and stuff.
1773386	1775788	And it's in that same perspective and everything.
1776508	1777549	So that was pretty awesome.
1777569	1778810	So definitely go check those out.
1778830	1780551	I'm planning on downloading them all and playing them.
1782032	1783793	But yeah, that's it.
1783833	1788636	And hopefully, I'm hoping that this whole hacking Lost and Damned thing works.
1789136	1791818	To have some more funny videos coming out.
1793739	1796160	It's funny, if you break open the Lost and Damned...
1797887	1798568	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1819531	1820452	Thanks for watching!
1844646	1847068	I never say never.
1848610	1851694	Things that we thought would never happen have happened.
1852415	1857440	Whoever thought we would boot up our Nintendo GameCube and see a Sega logo, right?
1858722	1861365	Whoever thought there would have been a Marvel DC crossover.
1861445	1863127	Wait, that was old.
1863720	1864000	All right.
1864280	1866681	Anyhow, other housekeeping this week.
1866701	1869501	I don't really have a whole lot of housekeeping this week.
1869561	1870642	I did housekeeping.
1870662	1871842	Yeah.
1871942	1874162	Just, you know, continue to support us on the web.
1874863	1878724	Again, if you've not visited the new orangelaunchradio.com, you need to check it out.
1878884	1882284	DarkSakura uploaded some of the pictures she took from Video Games Live, actually.
1882845	1885045	I uploaded the one to the main page there of the marquee.
1885145	1888806	But if you go into the OL Army pics on the gallery page,
1889306	1890227	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1913055	1915517	Some of these are a little blurry, but that one and that one are really good.
1915637	1916318	You should send those in.
1916358	1916999	I bet they'd use those.
1917039	1917919	I took them with my iPhone.
1918420	1918660	I know.
1918700	1920342	For iPhone pictures, it's not bad.
1920622	1924425	And then somebody apparently uploaded a thing that says, Rob is officially gayer than Christmas.
1925787	1926647	Rob versus Christmas.
1926667	1927548	You'll just have to check it out.
1927568	1929390	He asked me if it was me, and I said no.
1929550	1933073	No, I bet anything it was Travis and John last night on Understation Live.
1933093	1934374	This just seems like something they'd do.
1935515	1939018	This reeks of John and Travis somehow.
1940540	1942441	How can we fuck with the new OrangeLoungeRadio.com?
1942501	1945082	I know, let's make a Robbis Gay joke.
1946202	1948083	See, isn't it fun being friends with them?
1948583	1949544	I know, I know.
1949864	1951084	Those little bastards.
1952265	1952745	But I love them.
1953545	1954746	In a totally homosexual way.
1955286	1958407	Alright, let's get to some gaming news, Loki.
1958787	1963768	Well, you may remember last week Capcom was teasing something that they were going to announce on Monday.
1964268	1966929	Well, that announcement was Lost Planet 2.
1967769	1973771	And Lost Planet 2 looks very epic, very cold still, yet strangely enough is like in a jungle.
1974251	1975491	It's a frozen jungle.
1976572	1978472	But they have a bunch of other cool stuff.
1978572	1979592	It looks pretty sweet.
1980513	1980973	Right now...
1982349	1984091	4Player Online Co-op
1999617	2023006	which is pretty neat and I don't know I think the game looks really cool different environments they even have like some sort of mech thing because you before you can get like the mech suits well now these mech suits can get into a bigger mech suit that's like uh Voltron-esque so that looked kind of neat but uh very exciting but uh no word on when this is planning on um
2023854	2024695	Dead Rising 2 Lost Planet 2
2047883	2049164	I guess that's not too big of a surprise.
2049544	2056929	I was going to chat, by the way, Travis says it was not us that did the Rob is Gayer Than Christmas picture, so that'll just forever remain a mystery.
2057270	2061112	And now he's also saying Under Station Live... What if it was Fart Princess?
2061612	2062113	It could have been.
2063013	2064995	Now he's also saying Under Station Live is coming to an end.
2066064	2067185	and I'm just like, huh?
2067945	2070547	So I want more information on what this is all about.
2071128	2072329	I'm going to call you later, Travis.
2072549	2073850	You better call in later, Travis.
2073870	2075011	I want details.
2075051	2075851	What the hell is going on?
2076352	2078433	All right, anyhow, back to video games for now.
2078814	2080955	Assassin's Creed on the PSP.
2080995	2087020	A lot of announcements coming out of Sony camp this week about the PSP at one of their destination PlayStation events.
2087600	2090563	Assassin's Creed is going to be coming to the PSP.
2091463	2094766	Ubisoft will be putting it out on the Sony portable system a little later this year.
2095346	2101775	So apparently there's also going to be an Assassin's Creed bundle coming out as well with a PSP with it.
2102436	2104258	So there you go.
2104298	2110887	Assassin's Creed coming out a little later this year for you fans of that game and also for fans of having games on the PSP.
2112349	2112790	So there you go.
2115097	2122480	In other news, speaking of PSP stuff, you know there's actually something about LittleBigPlanet.
2122740	2128943	It's going to be on PSP, because I said so, and because apparently Sony says so too.
2129563	2140108	And it's going to be sometime before the end of the year, but it is in conjunction with Media Molecule, and it's supposed to be very much like the PS3 version, where you can...
2141888	2147910	Make your levels and share them and play the game and play everybody else's crap but just take it with you.
2147930	2149831	You know what I think?
2150211	2150431	What?
2151751	2165216	I think that it's going to be you would download everything through the PlayStation like you do through the PS3 like you do now with whatever link to the PSP.
2166095	2169196	I think this is one of the biggest does to come out of the PlayStation event.
2169236	2172877	I mean, LittleBigPlanet's been a huge new IP for them.
2172937	2176158	Although, I don't know how well it's been selling here in the U.S., but I think it's been doing much better overseas.
2177178	2181499	But, you know, I think this is no surprise at all that they're putting a port of this on the PSP.
2181519	2183039	We had rumors about this a few months ago.
2183880	2184520	No surprise here.
2184940	2187901	I guess I am surprised, though, that Media Molecule's not doing it themselves.
2188101	2188781	That's kind of...
2190602	2195866	I'm not surprised because they're busy doing expansions and stuff for the main game.
2196486	2197647	Just have someone else port it.
2197927	2198387	That's fine.
2199108	2200229	As long as it turns out alright.
2200249	2208075	I was going to say also that I think it's pretty cool that they're actually taking the PSP seriously this year.
2208955	2210697	Putting out some pretty strong games because I remember...
2211741	2212721	I don't know, I think it's kind of cool.
2212741	2217843	Something else that's going to be coming to the PSP, another PS3 franchise there, Motorstorm Arctic Edge, which is of course going to be more...
2236311	2237032	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2267335	2271737	The game will also be ported to the PlayStation 2 as well.
2272878	2276679	Because they tend to port a lot of those PSP games to the PS2 and vice versa.
2277099	2277540	Makes sense.
2277680	2279601	They're still cranking out PS2 games.
2280381	2280761	Still.
2281481	2284583	Still selling well, so why not?
2284743	2285743	I guess the price is right.
2285943	2289505	And it's probably pretty easy for them to port stuff like that to the PS2.
2290325	2291105	Might as well.
2291705	2292726	Get some more sales that way.
2294249	2298934	All right, well, if none of those games sounded interesting to you at all, maybe this is a little more up your alley.
2299534	2302197	A new Hannah Montana PSP bundle.
2302697	2303338	Oh, joy!
2303498	2303919	That's right.
2303959	2305600	This is coming out in July.
2305680	2308703	It's going to be a PSP in a brand new color called Lilac.
2309264	2309985	and DarkSakura.com.
2327945	2332170	But also it's coming out with a UMD of episodes from Hannah Montana.
2332590	2335113	Also a two gigabyte memory stick coming with it.
2335373	2341360	And, and, and, stickers to decorate your PSP with Hannah Montana.
2342141	2342681	So there you go.
2344029	2367654	apparently some also casual other things coming to the PSP Ubisoft has his Pets series coming to the PSP Pets Saddle Club being one of the first releases in September obviously this is happening to compete with the DS a little bit you know because they have the whole Carrie Underwood playing a pink DS commercial so you know Sony has now tapped into Hannah Montana which is you know what
2368374	2372136	Lover or hater, it's a huge brand for tween girls.
2372636	2375177	So I guess this is the way to go, right?
2375197	2376738	To try and sell some of these at Christmas time?
2377759	2379499	That they've tapped Hannah Montana?
2380260	2381100	Isn't that illegal?
2381260	2383261	You know what I mean, you ass.
2383661	2384882	La la la la la la.
2385002	2385702	Exactly.
2386543	2388303	So I don't know though.
2389064	2393306	I kind of want a baby shit purple PSP because I don't think anybody else would have one.
2394420	2409225	it is an interesting color but I want one of the blue ones more I think I'll get the Madden pack that came with the blue PSP even though I have a perfectly fine and functioning PSP right now I kind of want the lilac one but not bad enough to go for Hannah Montana I'm also just kind of like
2410103	2413605	You know the PSP2 announcement's coming, probably at E3.
2413725	2420448	So if I can at least make myself wait until E3 to upgrade my PSP, then I'll have motivation to just wait even longer until PSP2 comes out.
2420468	2422509	I don't think there is going to be PSP2 at E3.
2422650	2423450	I think there'll be something.
2423470	2429973	There'll be another revision, but from what I heard, it was supposed to be even slimmer with a sliding screen, but that's about it.
2430514	2430894	We'll see.
2430914	2432415	It'll just be the same thing.
2433035	2433835	Whatever, who cares?
2433935	2434876	It's not going to help.
2436437	2440519	GeoVidea in chat says, Tap, Ass, and Hannah Montana should not be said in the same sentence.
2440639	2442180	I apologize to any listener that was offended.
2444742	2445082	All right.
2445222	2446142	Enough Hannah Montana.
2446202	2448304	Please, DarkSakura, help us change the subject.
2448604	2449584	How about release dates?
2449664	2450605	How about release dates?
2451045	2458370	Well, we've got quite a bit for the UK, and I'm going to go on and go through next Sunday since it will already be after that by the time they get this.
2459070	2462232	So on March 4th, we have Empire Total War.
2463800	2464680	That's for PC.
2465221	2466942	On the 6th, Battle Fantasia.
2468382	2479428	There's also New Play, Control, Mario Power Tennis, Patapon 2, Tenchu, Shadow Assassins, Tom Clancy's Hawks, Watchmen, The End is Nigh.
2479468	2481629	That's for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
2482689	2485030	And Flock for Xbox 360.
2485971	2488212	The PlayStation 3 version says it's out on the 9th.
2488232	2489713	Yeah, those are the...
2490948	2492028	Live Arcade Games.
2492508	2493029	Gotcha.
2493309	2494809	Or PlayStation Network games.
2496610	2496910	Is that it?
2497230	2497630	That's it.
2497970	2498230	Okay.
2498690	2501611	Well, in the US, there's actually quite a bit coming out this week.
2502531	2509133	Lots of stuff, including, of course, the big title, Halo Wars, coming out on Xbox 360.
2511134	2518256	On PSP, we're getting Phantasy Star Portable, which is the remake of the Ambition of the Illuminous expansion.
2519316	2524939	We've also got MLB, both 09 and 2K9.
2524959	2541946	09, of course, coming out on all Sony platforms, and then 2K9 coming out on pretty much everything but the DS, because the DS version is getting MLB 2K9 Fantasy All-Stars, which is a weird-looking game, but whatever.
2542987	2545107	Empire Total War coming out on PC.
2547068	2557891	Also that week, we've got SBK Superbike World Championship coming out on PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii and PlayStation 2, I believe.
2561312	2567173	Also, Tom Clancy's Hawks on Xbox 360 and on PS3.
2568213	2574895	Wii Ski and Snowboard on the Nintendo Wii, kind of a sequel to that Wii Ski game that came out last year.
2576175	2579784	Also, coming out as well...
2581415	2585257	Littlest Pet Shop Spring because there's just not enough of those games.
2586137	2589639	King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match coming out on PlayStation 2.
2589719	2592461	A little retro fighting action there.
2593401	2599524	And then Spongebob vs. the Big One Beach Party Cook-Off, your Spongebob-themed Cookie Mama game.
2600645	2601645	And let's see here.
2601745	2604146	Sonic and the Black Knight on the Wii.
2605867	2607208	And finally...
2610424	2612166	It's not going to do well.
2612346	2613748	I can tell you right now.
2629960	2630841	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2651283	2652063	Resident Evil, not your mom.
2672461	2689399	PlayStation 3 also getting Biohazard 5 which seems to be dominating the week over there this week but don't count out MLB09 the show and Senju no Valkyria is getting a price reduction as well which is just you know Valkyria Chronicles over here in the US um
2690965	2703171	On the Nintendo Wii on March 5th, only one big release is Relaxuma Mina de Goryuri Sekatsu is coming out, which looks like a game with cute little animals.
2705012	2709675	There's no screenshots, just cute little finger-painted... Wouldn't that be awesome if that was a survivor horror game?
2712341	2713562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2735082	2742106	Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Kimo Koei and Simple DS Volume 47.
2742146	2745428	Because every week it seems like over there there's another Simple DS game coming out.
2746228	2756734	Lastly on the PSP, it looks like they're getting the 3000 in blue this week in Japan and red.
2758198	2760959	and a lot of matching gear coming out to match that.
2761099	2765661	Otherwise, Mineno Golf Portable, which is just Hot Shots Golf, is getting a price reduction.
2766282	2766662	There you go.
2766722	2769183	Not a lot of huge stuff in Japan this week since you have Resident Evil 5.
2769223	2771944	Did you see their new colors that they have for the DSi?
2773545	2775906	Just the black and the crappy blue.
2776406	2779688	No, they have the new colors for Japan.
2779808	2780548	No, I have not seen it.
2780568	2784530	They have this weird, not even maroon, it's like a...
2786257	2790700	I don't know, pinkish-purple, magenta-colored system.
2790800	2794083	They got this weird lime-green and then a dark blue.
2796225	2797525	It's probably better than the colors here.
2798186	2799447	That light blue is terrible.
2799507	2801068	I don't want a DSi in that color.
2801088	2802609	Well, I don't really want a DSi anyway.
2804351	2805251	I'm not sold on it yet.
2805972	2806372	Me neither.
2806552	2808474	Maybe when some of the DSi games start coming out.
2808594	2812497	I hardly ever play handhelds unless I'm in bed sick or something.
2812897	2813978	I'm just not a big handheld fan.
2814406	2816827	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2839502	2839822	Snowboard Riot
2866451	2867952	We'll see you next time.
2892970	2897552	And spoiler alert, beer pong's not worth it for 800 points there.
2897592	2898052	Damn it!
2899113	2902854	I was wanting to play it for myself and find that out, Loki.
2904095	2904555	Jerk.
2905095	2908336	Seriously, you can buy cups and a ping pong ball for cheaper.
2908717	2909797	And you can get drunk.
2910517	2911978	But only if you're 21 or over, please.
2914135	2924444	I was going to say, I don't know if you noticed, this week actually was the first week that they started offering, I guess over here, I thought they were available over here already, but Commodore 64 games on the virtual console.
2924764	2926185	I thought we mentioned it last week's show?
2926325	2926805	I don't remember.
2926886	2927446	Maybe we didn't.
2928387	2930028	Because I remember getting into a conversation about it.
2930048	2930528	No, I guess not.
2930809	2933431	If they just came out on Monday, I guess we wouldn't have brought it up yet.
2933911	2936972	But, um, yeah, no, I saw that they were there.
2937092	2941653	I haven't downloaded any yet, because I'm still on my stupid little I'm not downloading anything else kick.
2941673	2945013	Well, seriously, I mean, what, they announced a solution how long ago now?
2945213	2945714	Uh-huh.
2946454	2947754	And, uh, here's the thing.
2947814	2950054	Well, there is one thing that will break it.
2950375	2952795	When Impossible Mission comes out, I have to get it.
2953515	2954035	I have to.
2954815	2956296	Because I loved that game on the Commodore 64.
2957236	2958876	So, that'll be the thing that gets me to break.
2958896	2959657	You gotta stand strong.
2959677	2961577	But that didn't come out yet, so we'll see.
2962157	2978535	I never agreed to do it well if I conveniently forget to turn on the Nintendo Wii 2 I probably won't even remember to download it and if I just stay away from blog sites on Monday I won't ever hear it's out but now that I said that I'll get a million emails from listeners saying hey Rob did you break your thing yet?
2978595	2980878	Impossible Mission came out today jerk
2982195	2985556	Seriously, though, when are they going to... They're probably going to make this big announcement at E3.
2985616	2988437	It's like, yes, we're going to have a storage solution.
2988577	2990418	You know, we totally never announced this before.
2990498	2992438	Or you're going to have to buy this new system to get it.
2992958	2994279	Yeah, you're going to have to buy... Yeah.
2995779	2995899	Ugh.
2997100	2997460	Hate them.
2998740	2999320	Hate them all.
2999600	3000861	I love Nintendo.
3001861	3002961	Because we have Choaniki.
3004242	3004642	Whatever.
3005322	3007723	Anyways, not even Choaniki broke my ban.
3008322	3012808	ExciteBots Trick Racing is coming out on the Nintendo Wii April 20th.
3023722	3042890	and um no one seems to know what it is it's so crazy what exactly is excite truck or excite uh bots you know it is being made by uh the people that did excite truck and the excite bike fan or franchises i've never heard this game this is completely no this is i've never this is a shock
3043914	3044975	Absolutely new news to me.
3044995	3046035	Complete utter shock to me.
3046376	3048077	Okay, no, really, I have heard about this.
3048137	3052979	But it's funny that no one seems to know what the game is about.
3053280	3056201	And probably better that they don't.
3056562	3062985	I mean, surely it wouldn't be something as stupid as, like, the bots, like, battle each other or something.
3063025	3067608	Like, it's a racing, like, robot thing where they actually, like, a mech thing.
3067628	3068929	It wouldn't be that stupid, would it?
3069787	3072448	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
3095237	3096678	It would be crazy.
3096718	3099160	They could have a weird synopsis for it or something.
3099180	3102943	I'm just trying to think of what exactly we would say.
3106645	3107186	I don't know.
3107866	3108687	Make something up.
3108867	3113871	Try to make up what a possible synopsis for ExciteBots might read.
3114451	3115272	ExciteBots.
3116232	3117073	Let me think here.
3119435	3119595	Um...
3122246	3123026	Ah, let's see.
3123806	3140850	If I were to guess an Excitebots trick racing synopsis, I would say that Excitebots trick racing takes the big air thrills and simple controls of Excite Truck and ramps up the fun with a non-stop barrage of funky challenges and minigames performed at a blinding speed.
3141250	3150892	You won't believe your eyes when you find yourself shooting goals, throwing pies, even playing poker in the middle of racing robotic animals, insects, around off-road tracks.
3152162	3154643	Goddamn, Loki, you are one hell of an improv artist.
3154863	3155963	I know, it's so crazy.
3155983	3156643	That's amazing.
3156723	3158184	How poetic in your description.
3158384	3158664	I know.
3158684	3162985	And I also might say that it will support two to six players over Wi-Fi.
3163025	3164766	Why can't you be that eloquent normally?
3167067	3168027	I just don't have it in me.
3170282	3199985	you just got excited you're just too full of cheese sadly enough I do want to play this game but I'm really I'm scared that they fucked this up and you know it's like I've been waiting so long for an Excite Truck sequel and I know they fucked this up it's like you can't fuck this up you just do the same thing put out the same damn game just change the tracks add different cars you don't have to do anything it's sold okay but I know they fucked this up and it's really scaring me
3202338	3205140	So I'm loading up this to read this comment in chat.
3207541	3210523	X-Link says, Excitebox, it will make you shit your pants.
3211284	3216567	Which, by the way, this is a game I played a ton of this week, that Flash game, Don't Shit Your Pants.
3220530	3223652	That's my favorite new little sound I've heard in a Flash game.
3227034	3229216	Just Google it if you have no idea what I'm talking about.
3230657	3230717	Um...
3231832	3235695	Anyhow, uh, comments from chat, I'm sorry, no more comments from chat.
3235976	3237177	Oh, well, no, okay, some comments from chat.
3237237	3239479	TigerClaw says, why can't they do a sequel to Excite Bike?
3240400	3242141	Excite Bike, not Excite Truck, but Excite Bike.
3243202	3244824	Um, they could do that!
3245164	3247186	Excite Truck with Excite Bikes in there!
3247586	3250509	Oh my god, look at that, it's expanding on the franchise!
3250829	3252771	Do it like MotorStorm, I mean, come on!
3253531	3254672	GS68 suggests Excite Pants.
3267449	3273331	Mix the magic of Excite Truck with the suspense of Don't Shit Your Pants the game and you have Excite Pants.
3274411	3275131	Let me put it this way.
3275311	3276811	We have a toilet at one end of the course.
3276951	3278592	I'm still going to play this game.
3278792	3280052	I'm still going to try it out.
3281192	3290135	The description so far and the fact that I haven't seen any screenshots or know anything about it, it kind of scares me right now.
3290615	3294596	But I don't understand how playing poker and driving really fast...
3295495	3296016	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3315197	3321922	It was recently trademarked here in America, Final Fantasy IV The After Years, and that's a cell phone series over in Japan.
3321962	3322662	Well, guess what?
3322722	3327625	It has been announced this week that it's going to be coming out for the Wii.
3327725	3332849	Well, I guess it hasn't really been announced, but the ESRB has rated the title an E on the Wii.
3334147	3337350	Final Fantasy 4 The After Years Final Fantasy 4 The After Years
3351421	3352983	I think so, because it was a cell phone game.
3353023	3356767	So I'm kind of curious to see if they still keep it looking like that on the Wii.
3356827	3358869	It could be a download thing.
3358889	3359710	It might be WiiWare.
3359730	3361312	It might not necessarily be a disc.
3361492	3363354	It could be something that's going to be released WiiWare.
3363374	3364295	That's what it was supposed to be.
3364435	3367939	That could be kind of cool then, because it could be in the style of Mega Man 9.
3368640	3368840	Right?
3369180	3369581	That'd be cool.
3369701	3370502	That makes a lot of sense.
3371894	3377499	So that could also be something that makes me want to break my little band.
3377939	3380661	But seriously, I am so pissed off at Nintendo.
3380721	3382263	I mean, come on.
3382343	3385685	If they fuck this up, I'm out for blood.
3387587	3388388	You heard it here first.
3389408	3390289	Alright, so there you go.
3390329	3391370	Final Fantasy IV The After Years.
3391390	3392411	I want to definitely check that out.
3393402	3407926	Well, there's a device that we've discussed on the show a number of times, and I have one myself in the family of it, which I will not name nor say or let anyone know where I'm hiding it, because I actually just found it while I was cleaning.
3407946	3410846	Yeah, I can't find my DS... Thingy.
3412167	3414887	No, I can't find my DS, too, and the thingy that's in the DS.
3414927	3415728	I found my thingy.
3416628	3418468	I found the thingy in the box.
3418488	3418808	What thingy?
3419469	3420669	Okay, I have a Ninja Pass.
3422162	3423443	I have not used it.
3423784	3424764	I have nothing on it.
3424945	3425565	I just have one.
3426286	3430730	I have an R4 DS and an M3 and I put tons of pirated games on both of them.
3431250	3433612	But to be honest, I haven't played my DS in forever.
3433972	3436274	So much so that it's buried in a room somewhere.
3437295	3438096	Back to my story.
3438977	3440638	And it's funny that you mentioned the R4.
3440658	3444882	That's why I bought it too because it, you know.
3446445	3450546	The R4 is now officially outlawed in Japan.
3451586	3467410	There's actually an injunction filed against the Chinese manufacturer put out by the Tokyo District Court, and it's now illegal to sell anywhere in Japan.
3469573	3473556	In fact, you can't find them in stores anymore at all.
3474256	3493228	Squeenix, Capcom, Nintendo, the big guys, they're saying that because of the illegal sales, they're going to also make sure that they're going to try to knock down anyone who's selling the other types that are like the R4.
3495790	3497111	But who knows?
3497251	3499512	The other countries might be following suit.
3502914	3503415	Interesting.
3504075	3506417	We haven't heard about a lot of devices getting banned over there.
3506497	3512320	So this is... And now Loki, you're breaking the law of another country.
3514161	3515842	You know what, Rob?
3516483	3516663	Huh?
3518031	3520093	You see that cup on the floor?
3520293	3520513	What?
3520973	3521073	Yeah.
3521093	3522594	You'd get caned for that in Singapore.
3523395	3523795	Oh, gee.
3524435	3524756	Oh, no.
3525136	3526657	So you're breaking the law of another country.
3527317	3527918	It doesn't matter.
3528058	3532260	Like I said, you know, I don't even play my DS right now.
3534041	3534962	Or my PSP.
3535883	3541866	Out of curiosity, is there anyone in chat who owns one of these who thinks this is, you know, interesting, surprising?
3542727	3544548	Are you scared because now you have one?
3544608	3545789	Or are you just, like, whatever?
3545809	3546009	Whatever.
3546693	3548454	I'm totally not surprised, to be honest.
3548955	3549775	Yeah, I know.
3549835	3555059	It's not totally surprising, but... Oh, well.
3555800	3563926	Unfortunately, with the DS, they can't really flash it to not work with or to basically break it or anything.
3563946	3566808	They can't do any firmware updates like they can with the PSP.
3567428	3568769	What if it means they'll stop selling it?
3569690	3571031	Or if you'll still be able to get them over here?
3573253	3574854	Well, they've already made them pretty hard to get.
3575679	3603560	um in fact when I was buying mine um they were pretty hard to get and you know they were starting to pull them off you know shelves online and stuff like that so that you know they wouldn't get in any lawsuit trouble but uh luckily I got both of mine actually the M3 and R4 are almost identical in fact I think there's like one little point that you change on each chip that you can convert them back and forth and um
3605066	3606727	I don't know, they work okay.
3606928	3616535	The one I bought the M3 for, for Game Boy Advance, Homebrew stuff, because there was this one motocross game I wanted to try out, and there was some other Zelda-type game I wanted to try out that was kind of cool.
3617476	3624201	I haven't really played any ROMs for the Game Boy Advance, so I'm just not really interested in that.
3624882	3629766	And DS stuff, it's fun to check stuff out every now and then, but really nothing holds my interest for...
3631286	3636690	Hardly any time, so I just don't see the point in spending $20 on each of these games.
3636710	3643736	And that's on a cheap game, unless you get something Square Enix, which is like $40 for a fucking DS game, which is retarded.
3645397	3651662	I just can't see myself spending that kind of money on a game that I'm only going to play for a few hours and just kind of throw to the side.
3652773	3653654	It's just my own thing.
3653834	3655175	Economy's tough, you know what?
3655375	3662399	And I wasn't going to buy your game anyway, so... But hey, I spend my money... I spend plenty of money on other things, you know?
3662939	3671125	Like I said, you know, what, the last week or so, or a couple weeks ago, I... Five copies of Lost and Damned, so... You know, I'm paying my money.
3671145	3674287	Alright, let's move on with more news.
3674307	3675948	We've got to wrap up Part A, get to Part B tonight.
3676868	3677068	Yes.
3678209	3680370	So, kind of a game that I like...
3682512	3683853	Thanks for watching!
3697625	3702349	This sounds like an okay idea to me, but not that great.
3702409	3702689	I don't know.
3703009	3719703	There are some actual characters in Saints Row, so it works, but then again, the whole game is very sandbox-ish, and you can make your own main characters, so designing who the main character is going to be is a little bit tough, I think, but as far as an actual storyline that goes, it's kind of compelling.
3720264	3721304	There is one, but...
3722498	3731966	I don't know, I think that type, anything that's sandbox-ish, as far as gameplay goes, it's going to be very hard to make a movie out of.
3732486	3747919	But anyways, he's interested in it, and he says according to 50 Cent, he said that his relationship with THQ is very good, and you'll see Saints Row, I'm optioning the rights for that right now.
3748868	3751209	Dude, I hope the plot is as awesome as Blood on the Sand.
3752389	3756651	You know, Blood on the Sand, I think, to be honest, is just fun.
3756911	3757812	That's the whole point.
3757912	3759913	It wasn't like he was trying to be serious.
3759973	3760873	I think it was just fun.
3761233	3767796	Speaking of plot and movies and something that didn't make our show roll tonight, but I was chatting with somebody before the show about this.
3768336	3772178	Have you heard about how horrifically the new Street Fighter movie is doing?
3772218	3775519	Apparently it has a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.
3775879	3776800	Oh, I would believe it.
3776920	3778501	I mean, it looks like crap.
3778641	3779221	I'm sorry.
3780042	3784505	One of my LiveJournal friends went and saw it and said it is worse than the original Street Fighter movie, if you can imagine.
3785225	3785465	Yeah.
3785826	3788107	That was actually a ringing endorsement to me.
3788167	3788988	I love bad movies.
3789028	3790008	Now I kind of want to go see it.
3790489	3791789	Oh, it's out?
3791990	3793210	Yeah, it just came out on Friday.
3793230	3795092	I completely forgot about it.
3795432	3798894	I wonder how terrible it did at the box office, because box office numbers come out.
3799494	3800055	Let me go look.
3801772	3808455	It was pretty much Street Fighter, the movie this week, and Jonas Brothers in 3D.
3808976	3814679	Okay, Medea Goes to Jail was the number one movie this week with 16.5 million bucks.
3814839	3815839	Medea Goes to Jail, okay.
3815939	3822182	Jonas Brothers, 12.7 million, which they say was actually underperforming compared to the Miley Cyrus movie a few months ago.
3822663	3826825	Slumdog Millionaire, 12.1 million, but it just won the Oscar.
3827165	3828766	So it was not in the top three.
3829713	3840417	Nor was it 4, 5, or 6, or 7 Street Fighter came out its opening weekend number 8 When did it beat?
3840837	3842278	4.6 million dollars What did it beat?
3842338	3853082	Confessions of a Shopaholic in its third week of release Friday the 13th in its third week of release Fired Up in its second week of release But what beat it?
3854397	3861802	Paul Blart, Mall Cop, and its seventh week of release made more money than Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li, and its seventh week of release.
3863043	3866945	Coraline, but I hear that's a good movie, so we don't need to make fun of that.
3869727	3872109	It's a Street Fighter movie that has like...
3873746	3874247	Thank you for watching!
3896576	3908004	All right, well, hey, speaking of game movies, a good game movie, I think, anyway, a lot of people disagree with me, but one of the better ones in many, many years, in my opinion, Silent Hill was a video game movie that came out.
3908104	3908545	I liked it.
3908825	3909926	We all generally liked it.
3909946	3911347	I saw it four times in the theater.
3911607	3912347	You really liked it.
3912367	3912968	I saw it twice.
3912988	3913688	Loki liked it, yeah.
3914089	3917151	So I think we can all agree that the Silent Hill movie is pretty awesome.
3918151	3920153	And, of course, we love the series of games.
3920493	3921374	Love the series of games.
3921634	3922174	Well, guess what?
3922194	3924196	Maybe not so much the last few, but yeah.
3924736	3926658	Well, I didn't think they were terrible.
3926838	3930121	But anyway, obviously one of the best ones was the first one.
3930241	3930942	And guess what?
3931362	3938228	Since we're talking about remaking games for the Wii, a Wii make, if you will, there's been lots of these types of Wii makes coming out recently.
3938288	3941311	Now, most of them, granted, have just been old GameCube games getting new controls.
3941371	3947116	But what if they were to remake the original PlayStation Silent Hill game on the Nintendo Wii?
3947256	3948578	With extra fog?
3949178	3949719	Hopefully.
3949779	3950880	You know why they did the fog?
3951540	3951800	Why?
3951860	3954002	Because loading or something?
3954623	3959646	Well, anyway, this is coming from a report from VG247.
3960047	3965591	Apparently Konami is planning a port of the Silent Hill game for the Wii.
3965811	3969114	Also coming to the PSP as well, Climax.
3969694	3973417	The folks who did Silent Hill Origins are the ones that are supposed to be doing this new remake.
3973537	3974738	So that could be interesting.
3974858	3984021	You know, I'm surprised that Climax hasn't exactly optioned N-Space's engine that they use for the game that's not ever coming out, unfortunately, Winter.
3984541	3986662	Because remember, that game looked very much Silent Hill.
3986782	3989122	I wonder if they're using it, though.
3989623	3990223	You gotta wonder.
3990283	3999646	Maybe that's part of why they're doing this on the Wii, is maybe the folks at Konami saw this and was like, hey, we want you to make this a Silent Hill game, but we got a really good idea.
3999826	4002426	Why don't you redo the first story or something like that, you know?
4002727	4003207	Yeah.
4003447	4003767	Could be.
4004542	4006784	I really freaking want a good Silent Hill remake.
4023562	4024123	Here's the thing.
4024503	4027645	It could be a remake like a new Play Control remake.
4028026	4028886	Yoink, yoink, yoink.
4028946	4029527	Whatever, right?
4029547	4033269	But it could also be a remake like Metroid Zero, which is an awesome remake.
4033770	4040975	I hate to interrupt real quick, but I'm so glad that the monitor obstructed the camera's view of the gesture that you just made.
4041235	4041456	Why?
4041536	4041976	What'd I do?
4042616	4043677	The yank, yank, yank.
4043957	4044858	Oh, yeah.
4045198	4046479	That's why we have the big monitor here.
4046539	4048040	It sensors my hand when I do things like that.
4048060	4048761	So no one can see Rob fapping.
4051323	4051643	All right.
4052484	4052684	Look.
4054557	4055657	You know I have to derail it.
4056418	4056698	All right.
4057318	4057978	Silent Hill.
4058198	4058378	Yes.
4058398	4058758	I want it.
4060359	4061419	You know what other stuff we want?
4062700	4063960	Punch Out!
4064400	4065301	No, I just want a punch.
4065681	4067922	So, so getting this.
4068842	4071663	May 18th, we're getting Punch Out on the Wii.
4072143	4074464	And little Mac looks like he all done grown up.
4074884	4076845	He actually looks kind of mean in this picture.
4077865	4086572	So, um, we will be getting some, um, punch-out, and hopefully that we will get, like, King Hippo and, you know, Glass Joe and all of those.
4086632	4088174	I hope they make new characters, though.
4088314	4089975	I mean... I'm sure we're gonna get new characters.
4090015	4092017	I think they'll have to be some new characters.
4092057	4095660	I will bet you, I will bet you there are not new characters in this.
4095780	4098382	I bet you it's just the remake of the first game.
4098982	4099323	Really?
4099383	4100343	You think they'd be that bold?
4101044	4102165	I think they'd be that lazy.
4102445	4104407	Yes, I do think they'd be that lazy.
4106132	4106773	I hope not.
4107734	4108174	I'm sorry.
4108355	4110277	I have no optimism in Nintendo anymore.
4111858	4113340	Oh, snap.
4113420	4120668	GameGuru seems to kind of have that same skepticism, saying, I'll wait for reviews before getting Punch Out from our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com.
4121910	4125233	I mean, don't get me wrong, it looks good, but... You know what I say to your skepticism?
4125734	4125934	Huh?
4127984	4131526	Fine, say that all you want, but it's going to happen the way I said it.
4132266	4137990	Tiger Claw making an interesting point in chat room regarding remakes and this whole discussion, kind of talking about Hollywood remakes.
4138050	4141852	Tiger Claw says, Have you heard that Hollywood wants to remake The NeverEnding Story?
4141952	4143413	Yes, I did hear that this week.
4143633	4146534	Jeez Louise, come up with a new idea.
4146875	4147915	No, exactly.
4147995	4149036	No, no, no, no, no.
4149076	4150036	You do not remake The NeverEnding Story.
4150056	4152398	I don't have a problem with them doing that because they weren't that great.
4152478	4153839	I mean, they were okay, but...
4154799	4158041	The first one is that great.
4158441	4160242	It remains epic to this day.
4160982	4163923	The second one had the guy who played the Flash as the dad.
4164644	4166164	That's always why I like that.
4166284	4169166	Because I kind of loved that show.
4170306	4171106	Even though it failed.
4171747	4173147	But I can do without a remake.
4173327	4173688	Come on.
4174588	4176489	If you can actually understand her name...
4178211	4179094	Say my name!
4179174	4179916	It won't make a point.
4180658	4181541	Say my name!
4182945	4184389	You never understand what the hell he's saying.
4185071	4185712	Anyway, forget it.
4186442	4189583	A couple more stories and we'll get to Part B. Classic Game of the Week coming up as well.
4189643	4190624	Maybe that's her name.
4190684	4191384	It's foreign.
4192324	4193805	What?
4194685	4206970	So this week, to coincide with the movie release, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and PC will be getting the Watchmen The End is Nigh, the kind of prequels to the whole Watchmen storyline.
4207470	4209691	And it will be sold for a whopping $20.
4210451	4214753	Or 1600 Microsoft points on Xbox Live Arcade.
4215896	4219859	That sounds a bit expensive to me, but it's supposed to be pretty good.
4219919	4224081	It's kind of a brawler type game, but $20, really?
4224762	4225282	I'm going to wait.
4226123	4233387	This movie is also not getting some good early reviews, although there's lots of fanboys with big, big boners for Watchmen.
4233608	4235909	You know, I'm interested to see it, but I don't know.
4240775	4242376	I'd see it, but not opening day.
4242496	4245256	I'd kind of wait and see what some of my friends think about it before I go see it.
4245516	4249877	I mean, the story's interesting, but it's not like, oh my god, this is the best novel ever.
4250158	4252858	You know, this is the best graphic novel ever, ever.
4253478	4259340	Because if that's the best graphic novel that there ever was, thank god, graphic novels suck.
4260540	4263021	I mean, because seriously, that is where you're setting the bar?
4264181	4264701	I don't think so.
4267975	4268875	Alright, well we'll see.
4285763	4286684	Here's the interesting thing.
4286924	4295067	EA, apparently, it was their chief operating officer, John Pleasance, made a statement at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference.
4295588	4303712	Quote, when we look back five years, the fantasy of being a rock star by punching the buttons that are flowing down the screen is going to be one implementation in what is going to be a very large category.
4304032	4308494	There are lots of other things you can do with music, and we're working on interesting things.
4308914	4311475	And we know our competition is working on interesting things.
4312196	4314777	So what exactly are they working on?
4315880	4319145	However, he went on to say, we're not in any position to announce anything.
4319565	4321167	I think it's a robust category.
4321548	4324712	Over the coming years, there will hopefully be lots of things we will do in the music category.
4324752	4326254	So could EA be up to something?
4326735	4327916	Of course they're up to something.
4327976	4329679	Music games are, you know...
4330700	4331140	DarkSakura.com
4359244	4361106	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4379228	4393360	Parasol Stars is in the series of Bubble Bobble, a direct sequel to Rainbow Islands, where you basically use your parasols to...
4394401	4396543	I never realized it was never an arcade game.
4396563	4396723	Hmm.
4420603	4434326	We got it from Working Designs, though, in the U.S., who was responsible for bringing us tons of different, you know, really awesome games from Japan.
4434346	4438687	Like, they gave us Rayearth, Silhouette Mirage.
4439547	4441047	Didn't they do Radiant Silvergun?
4442748	4443328	I don't remember.
4444088	4444248	No.
4445909	4447149	At any rate, it's, you know...
4449351	4457555	Oh yeah, another game that I'd covered on the show was Brain Fart.
4458876	4459576	Brain Fart the game?
4461537	4463038	But anyway, back to Parasol Stars.
4463619	4467881	So yeah, this is a Taito game, came out in 1991.
4469061	4474024	And you play as Bub and Bob, but you play as their human counterparts.
4475625	4477946	Which would be... The same characters from Rainbow Islands.
4478246	4479591	Yeah, the same from Rainbow Islands.
4479952	4480614	Bubby and Bobby.
4481196	4481257	Um...
4485072	4485833	What creative names.
4486133	4488094	Was this game only out on TurboGrafx?
4488114	4491137	Wasn't it out on Super Nintendo as well, I thought?
4491937	4492317	I could be wrong.
4492337	4493038	Well, we'll get to that.
4493058	4493598	Oh, sorry, sorry.
4493899	4494199	My bad.
4495420	4507609	So, basically, Parasol Stars, though, it was sort of retconned out of their continuity because Bub and Bob got turned back into little dragons for Bubble Symphony and all those.
4508309	4509570	Bubble Memories and Bubble Symphony.
4510291	4510371	Um...
4512330	4523494	and so Parasol Stars is considered a side story to the whole bubble world.
4525454	4529656	At any rate, like I said, you can get different items, you can also
4531437	4541747	You have to collect these star items as you go through that lets you access these other planets, because you're basically going through the levels and moving to other planets so that you can get all the stuff to save the world.
4544329	4548674	So you have ten rounds on each planet, and there's a boss in each one, except a level thirty.
4549214	4550715	and, wait, wrong, sorry.
4552815	4559697	But when you get the star items, you have access to two other planets, one that's around Bubble Bobble and one around another game called Chack'n Pop.
4561658	4564878	They're not available on the main screen, you actually have to get stuff to unlock it.
4565579	4573761	And then you have the final boss, who is the one who is responsible for stealing all the color from the world.
4575262	4580347	and, um, it's like the uber boss of everything, and so you get the true ending that way.
4581448	4593020	Um, so like I said, you gather the drops, you can throw them, and if you gather, like, uh, uh, five drops, then you can just do the smackdown with a big, kickass attack.
4594561	4594641	Um...
4596543	4601005	So, uh, also each of the drops has a different elemental theme, so that's pretty cool.
4601766	4614171	Um, but yeah, this, um, as far as I'm aware, I think this did, um, I think it came out on, um, the Amiga, if I remember correctly.
4615252	4619113	Um, the Atari ST, there's a Game Boy version.
4619634	4621535	The NES, I want to say.
4624797	4628900	and, of course, the TurboGrafx-16 or PC Engine.
4629760	4631662	But, yeah, I think this came out on the NES.
4631842	4635164	Which is probably its most notable version is the TurboGrafx-1.
4635344	4635584	Yes.
4636445	4636905	There you go.
4637666	4638026	Alright.
4638567	4639167	There you go!
4640388	4645972	Parasol Star is your classic game of the week if you're a fan of Bubble Bobble right in the same series, so check that out.
4647679	4651420	Alright, that's going to bring Part A of Orange Lounge Radio to a close tonight.
4651520	4655481	But stick around, we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, including some more news stories.
4655621	4660222	And for those of you on Justin.TV, it looks like we're going to do a little bit of a game look tonight.
4660483	4662843	What game are you looking at on Justin.TV tonight, Loki?
4664023	4664544	Eat Lead.
4664564	4668185	Eat Lead is going to be the game we're looking at on Justin.TV during the break tonight.
4668925	4672786	However, stay tuned, we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4675623	4690614	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March the 1st of 2009, here for our 315th episode of Orange Lounge Radio, which we've been looking at a game here in studio on Justin.TV, Eat Lead.
4691454	4693636	How's this game been going for you, Loki?
4693756	4694877	It's going okay.
4695097	4695337	Yeah?
4695957	4704543	I haven't been watching a lot of this on Justin.TV, but I was running in the house during the break, but... Yeah, I was trying to get to a save point real quick.
4704764	4705104	Dope.
4706127	4706747	Oh, did I just die?
4707307	4709608	I think you did, because you turned your back when something was going ahead.
4710288	4711808	He did the switchy move.
4712848	4713829	I haven't really been paying attention.
4713849	4714649	I'll pause it for later.
4714889	4715169	All right.
4715909	4717269	Maybe we'll look at it a little more after the show.
4717289	4718270	Actually, no, I'm not going to pause it.
4718290	4718650	I'm going to quit.
4718830	4719410	All right, then quit.
4720050	4725091	All right, we've got some news we're going to get back into here on Part B. We've got to wait for Loki to get set up here.
4727471	4727771	I don't know.
4727791	4729032	How do we kill time at this point?
4729572	4733393	Loki, I need you to be here to start reading news at the top of the show.
4734213	4734793	What am I going to do?
4736488	4738589	All right, we're resetting back up Justin.TV.
4738629	4745232	If you're joining us here on this Sunday night, Justin.TV slash Orange Launch Radio if you want to see us live taping the show.
4745873	4749535	And, of course, you can always join our chat room as well, chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
4749875	4750395	Oh, thank you.
4751335	4756858	Bress Lowell is there in chat and is reminding me of something I wanted to mention at some point during the show tonight.
4756898	4760160	That is Orange Launch Radio USL March Madness is going on right now.
4760780	4768647	and some surprising votes going on right now in the Orange Lounge Radio USL March Madness.
4768688	4776194	If I remember right, last time I looked, Mega Man 2 is beating Ocarina of Time, which is certainly a controversial little matchup going on right now.
4776715	4781119	But what's interesting is that there will be three Zelda games in the top eight if...
4785591	4795977	The voting does go in Zelda Ocarina of Time's favor because I think right now The Legend of Zelda and Link to the Past are both ahead as well.
4796257	4800159	So could be very interesting how that all plays out.
4800219	4802700	So again, if you want to participate in that, you can go to our forums.
4803080	4806662	By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast, it'll already be down to eight.
4807002	4810544	But if you're listening live on this Sunday evening, they're at the Sweet 16 right now.
4811084	4812265	So check that out.
4812845	4813105	All right.
4815066	4815747	Almost done, Loki?
4816727	4821749	Alright, he's just plugging the computer back in, getting ready to do the encoding for JustDV.
4821769	4823170	I could read an email.
4823950	4825031	You want to do an email real fast?
4825171	4825791	Sure, why not?
4826191	4827652	Do a preliminary mailbag?
4827992	4829953	Yes, because then that means there'll be less to read later.
4830153	4831714	Alright, sure, well let's start off with an email.
4831774	4833875	I don't have the music though, so just read an email.
4833935	4835895	I have to read this because it's super amusing.
4835935	4838096	This is an email from Sauce.
4838857	4839177	Alrighty.
4840020	4840861	Hey, OLR!
4841582	4846987	I know you guys are fans of laughing at stupid people, so I thought I would share a sad but true story with you.
4847388	4849930	To make it video game related, imagine Super Mario Bros.
4849970	4851171	music playing in the background.
4852633	4853774	I might be able to arrange that, actually.
4854615	4854895	Okay.
4856036	4858459	I'm sorry, this actually is so funny that I do want to read it right away.
4858479	4858859	Okay.
4858879	4859020	Okay.
4860346	4864010	On Friday afternoon, I was at UNLV heading to my graphic design class.
4864450	4867153	From the second floor of the building, this hallway is open air.
4868114	4871296	You can see the major street in front of the university.
4871397	4874199	As I was heading into class, I witnessed a car accident.
4874499	4877842	An old, smaller-sized pickup truck rear-ended an orange new Beetle.
4878303	4882387	It was a very loud sound, so many of my classmates came out of the computer lab to see what had happened.
4882987	4886113	As we watched, the Beetle pulled into the parking lot in front of our building.
4886153	4895229	The pickup truck sat there for about a minute without pulling out of the street, and then, once the Beetle's owner had gotten out of his car, the truck made a U-turn and sped off down the street.
4896775	4899477	We were obviously quite appalled by this, but what could be done?
4899797	4904619	We realized that none of us had gotten the guy's license plate, and then one of my classmates shouted down to the beetle driver, Look!
4905140	4906020	And pointed to the street.
4906681	4907961	Cue the game over music.
4908402	4917887	Because in the middle of the street, where the accident had occurred, lay the front bumper of the truck with the license plate still attached.
4918687	4923270	The beetle owner called the police, and a few of us gave a statement to the police officer about the accident.
4923970	4924491	We don't know...
4925971	4927812	We don't know why the guy in the truck took off.
4927852	4930313	Maybe he didn't have insurance or maybe he had outstanding tickets.
4930713	4945097	But I'm pretty sure the moral of the story is that if you're going to turn a car accident that you're responsible for into a felony hit and run, you might want to make sure that you don't leave any incriminating evidence behind like your bumper and your license plate.
4945797	4950019	I just wish I could have seen the look on the truck driver's face when he got home and realized he had left his license plate behind.
4950039	4950979	Cheers, Warren.
4957984	4958425	XBOX LIVE NAMES
4973444	4974144	Profiles, etc.
4989810	4995895	Richard Gaywood or something like that which was his actual name and he ended up getting banned as well because Gay was in the name.
4996236	5016733	Well now we have a self-identified lesbian being banned from Xbox Live because in her I guess profile it said that she was a lesbian and so apparently that rubbed someone the wrong way so she got banned and
5018044	5035317	Now, of course, people are kind of up in arms about the whole thing, and apparently Microsoft's Steven Toulouse, an Xbox Live team member, has made a post on his personal blog regarding the situation, and they're hopefully going to explore some policy changes.
5036258	5040061	And also, I guess, GLAAD is weighed in on the story as well, so...
5041062	5044403	Well, I'll link it in the chatroom.
5044443	5046484	I blogged about this actually yesterday.
5049545	5055407	I have choice things to say about the way this was handled.
5055587	5061789	And I think inelegant does not even remotely touch what a crying shame it was.
5063570	5064510	I won't say more than that.
5065560	5085305	Basically, the whole situation was, as Microsoft noted in a statement, they said that users may not create a gamertag or use text in any profile field that includes comments that look, sound like, stand for, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate content of a potentially sexual nature.
5085465	5090246	Profiles that do are asked to change the language and are suspended until changes are made.
5090826	5092087	And it says, I guess...
5093047	5098269	The company also states it does not allow gamer tags or profiles to identify any form of sexual orientation.
5098689	5102231	Which is funny because there's nothing about that in their terms of usage nor their code of conduct.
5103931	5104331	Nothing.
5105852	5108133	I read the entire both of them.
5108533	5116176	There is not a single thing in the terms of usage or in the code of conduct on Xbox.com.
5116996	5117316	Nothing.
5117536	5117896	Zero.
5118817	5119117	Zilch.
5121092	5121372	I don't know.
5121392	5124734	You'd think I'd have a stronger opinion on this, you know, being the gay one on the show.
5124814	5125915	But I don't know.
5126095	5128976	I kind of feel it might be one of those unfortunate things.
5128996	5133599	There's a lot of these things on blog posts that, you know, kind of take it and run, tend to be.
5133999	5139982	I kind of feel like it might be one of those things that's being blown horrifically out of proportion, like there just might be something else going on.
5140563	5140943	I don't know.
5141043	5142804	For all we know, we don't know.
5142964	5147507	For all we know, she could have been doing other questionable stuff on Xbox Live.
5147607	5148047	We don't know.
5148732	5150033	I've seen people on Xbox Live do this.
5169384	5172305	I've seen just, you know, blatant harassment going on.
5173185	5177286	And, you know, people are like that, you know, outside of the virtual environment.
5177306	5177927	Oh, don't get me wrong.
5178067	5182428	That's totally inexcusable and should definitely be dealt with.
5182548	5190690	But there's no reason why someone shouldn't be able to, I mean, and I personally agree that, you know, it shouldn't matter in the end.
5191230	5192531	But, you know, if she's...
5193471	5195472	Proud of it, why not have something in her?
5195872	5203835	You know, what it said on the terms of usage on Xbox Live was, and this is item number five, how you may not use the service.
5204575	5209657	Create a gamertag avatar or use text in other profile fields that may offend other members.
5210277	5211158	That's what it said.
5212225	5222970	So basically, it can be summarized as the Xbox Live powers that be saying, Oh, being gay is offensive.
5223271	5226172	Because they're all offended that you're a lesbian.
5228433	5232615	That's pretty much how it came out as.
5232815	5236057	I wonder if any of those people that were harassing her were ever dealt with.
5236497	5237558	If they were ever punished.
5238462	5254790	Now see, what's interesting is that in Microsoft's response to this whole thing, they say, as stated in the Xbox Live Terms of Use, a member may not create a gamertag or use text in other profile fields that include comments that look, sound like, stand for, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate content of a potentially sexual nature.
5255171	5258692	Profiles that do are asked to change the language and suspended until changes are made.
5258752	5265896	In regard to sexual orientation, for gamertags or profiles, we do not allow expression of any type of orientation, be it hetero or other.
5266316	5267417	That is not in...
5268982	5272825	Create a gamertag avatar or use text in the profile fields that may offend other members.
5272845	5276147	Create a gamertag avatar or use text in the profile fields that may offend other members.
5298621	5299041	DarkSakura.com
5321052	5331578	Just because if you put on there lesbian, it's not the same as exactly saying I like to fuck chicks.
5334179	5341903	Because there were people up there who fully had really sexist comments in their profiles.
5341943	5342964	I've seen them before.
5343724	5344585	But, you know...
5345848	5347189	Nothing about orientation yet.
5347209	5349109	These were all, you know, pretty offensive things.
5349749	5350650	You know, what happened to them?
5350670	5351450	Why aren't they banned?
5351870	5361213	You know, I don't think that listing your orientation exactly relates to the act of fucking.
5362674	5369576	Now, if she said in there, I'm a lesbian and I like, you know, big strap-ons, then I understand.
5369816	5371157	Just put I heart scissoring.
5371317	5371657	Well, you're...
5373685	5376688	I like cutting paper with scissors, therefore it's scissoring.
5376908	5377769	I heart scissoring.
5394329	5394609	DarkSakura.com
5415472	5416313	for the matter of argument?
5416513	5416933	I don't know.
5417493	5418975	But do you see what I mean?
5419115	5420916	They did not have anything.
5421256	5429582	You know, he said in his comment, including, you know, orientation, you know, listening to that, but nowhere in the terms of usage.
5429982	5432024	That is a blatant lie.
5434894	5446502	He has lied to the public through MTV News and it is in print on not just my own blog but on plenty of news sites now where he is a goddamn liar.
5448304	5449244	But I don't know.
5449344	5459652	I mean, still, it's not like they are talking to GLAAD about the whole thing and the Human Rights or whatever they're called, the Human Rights Campaign, HRC, and all this stuff.
5459692	5461473	It just seems like if they were that...
5462907	5466412	You know, against all this or something, they wouldn't even be having that dialogue.
5466773	5473162	You know, in a way, I'm kind of glad that they're not star, star, starring it out like Sony does in Home.
5474110	5480274	What it is, is basically they have a list of banned words that they are considering offensive.
5480814	5486678	And yeah, they have to unfortunately cover everything, including homo and all that stuff.
5486758	5490981	And that's why they have the gay in there as well, because people use it in derogatory fashion.
5491601	5497384	And lesbian is in there as well, and that's unfortunate that it's on this blacklist, but that's what it is.
5497765	5501527	And because this person had it in their profile, that's why their account was banned.
5501687	5504010	It's just like the guy Richard Gaywood or whatever.
5504610	5505832	His name is Gaywood.
5505852	5506552	That's his name.
5506713	5508555	Hers wasn't a random banning.
5509376	5518266	Hers was banned when she reported the harassment of other people against her and they said, oh, well it's because of your profile, ban.
5519667	5523011	They banned her because other people were offended.
5524554	5526095	Yeah, I'd agree that's pretty messed up.
5526195	5534360	They need to ban other, you know, it's just rampant on Xbox Live and some of those games, you know, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, in some of those Halo matches.
5534380	5535361	They don't want me as a moderator.
5536362	5536582	No.
5537743	5539464	You know why they don't want me as a moderator.
5540004	5541185	I will fuck their shit up.
5542586	5543186	Seriously.
5543226	5550931	Well, they say, and you know, I've even seen people, you know, they follow on Twitter, they're like, seriously, when you see that stuff, you know, the fag, fag, fag, report it.
5551291	5552552	They will do something about it.
5553072	5553773	So, I don't know.
5555625	5556025	I do.
5556105	5558566	When people annoy me on there, I report it.
5558646	5559726	I'm a tattle.
5560126	5567628	Basically what was happening though is if all these people are following her from area to area while she's trying to play a game and just do her own thing.
5567928	5568588	That's harassment.
5568868	5570449	That's blatant harassment.
5570469	5572029	Why haven't those people been banned?
5572769	5576030	I mean, I think that if you go after someone with malicious intent.
5576050	5577251	Well, here's the question.
5577311	5578491	Do we know that they haven't?
5579807	5580327	Get off my internet.
5603772	5604353	DarkSakura.com
5624977	5625838	Um, yeah.
5626838	5627178	I don't know.
5627359	5629500	I'm kind of curious to see what ultimately becomes of this.
5629560	5631041	I still feel like it's kind of early on.
5631081	5632962	I think we'll see more kind of come out of this next week.
5633362	5635663	And I think we're going to end up revisiting this topic next week.
5635703	5639605	But in the meantime, if you have your own thoughts on it, you can give us a call later in the show.
5639866	5641667	Or you can always send us an email, of course.
5642547	5643508	DarkSakura loves emails.
5643988	5645569	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5647346	5652269	Well, on Xbox Live, for those of you that haven't gotten banned from your profiles yet, there are some things to look forward to in the future.
5652710	5656512	Worms Armageddon Decades is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.
5657693	5663757	This is apparently an old game, about 10 years old, that's come out previously.
5663837	5664617	What was this on before?
5664817	5667859	The Nintendo 64, I think, and the PlayStation and PC?
5668680	5673603	They're remaking this for Xbox Live Arcade, which isn't too surprising when you consider that the original Worms
5673963	5675644	Worms Armageddon Death Tanks Death Tanks
5703772	5706674	I don't know if it's any good, but I love Scorched Earth.
5706974	5708075	Who doesn't love Scorched Earth?
5708635	5709616	That game is awesome.
5710516	5712218	Because it's hot.
5714399	5715880	Talking about the game, silly pants.
5716821	5718282	My pants aren't silly, they're denim.
5719442	5720123	Moving on.
5722353	5726755	Back to the Xbox Live Arcade, even though they're bastards in charge.
5728675	5731516	I'm getting, and this is me specifically getting this.
5731537	5732217	This is for me.
5732977	5735118	At least in my own private universe, this is for me.
5735838	5742241	One of my favorite ever games is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, according to Famitsu.
5743061	5744101	Do we know what that is?
5744261	5745202	I'll give you a clue.
5745282	5746222	It involved twin sticks.
5747482	5750264	I have twin sticks for this game, by the way, Rob.
5750884	5751444	Did you know that?
5753180	5754181	Somehow I'm not surprised.
5754361	5755261	Virtual On!
5755781	5759103	Oratario Tangram is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.
5759663	5761844	And I can't use my twin sticks!
5762704	5764205	I actually have the Dreamcast twin sticks.
5764225	5766766	You can, but you'd have to modify them.
5767967	5768127	No.
5769308	5770388	I'll just make a converter.
5772489	5777712	But yeah, it's going to be on there for 1,200 points.
5778692	5780833	And oh my god, I love this game!
5781055	5782116	Did Michael Jackson have one of these?
5782136	5782256	Huh?
5782276	5784117	Did Michael Jackson have one of these for sale?
5784137	5784977	I don't know, I didn't look
5809255	5814539	Honestly though, there's only one more game really other than this that I would want to have a deluxe cab of.
5816040	5818362	But you probably can't guess what it is.
5820103	5820744	Planet Harrier.
5822785	5826048	But anyway, it's robot on robot action.
5826148	5827609	Ooh, kinky, but seriously.
5828550	5831552	It's just beat them up and get to the end of the game.
5831672	5835015	And I actually have, Dan and I have two clocks.
5835976	5836877	that Sega released.
5836937	5840360	I have one of the Feiyan and then we've got one of the last boss.
5840900	5842761	The annoying bitch that he is.
5845344	5845824	Get the game!
5848550	5854692	Well, there's another game that you won't have to actually pay for that will be coming to... Well, actually, you may have to pay for this one.
5856473	5860834	Quake 3 Arena for Xbox Live Arcade is close to being finished.
5861734	5865956	And apparently this was first spotted as an ESRB leak.
5866396	5867356	Actually, I do remember the leak.
5867396	5869657	I think this was around E3 even, last year.
5870618	5870798	And...
5872537	5875261	Apparently it's looking pretty good.
5875341	5880509	And that kind of makes sense with some of the other Quake-themed stuff that was coming soon.
5880529	5881831	Neat.
5884694	5888697	Speaking of Quake, I tried to get into Quake Live this week, and I see people talking about that in chat right now.
5888757	5893380	Actually, it looks like HitStun's looking for people to play Quake Live with, but I could not get past that queue.
5893640	5900365	Because, you know, the day it was announced, thousands of people in the queue because everybody was probably getting thrown to it from different blog sites.
5900505	5909871	But, you know, I went back earlier today to try to check it out, and the queue was only 35 people, which, sadly, I didn't have time to wait again because I had to do this show tonight.
5909931	5911692	But I'm going to try and check it out a little later on tonight.
5912012	5914314	But in looking at the demo videos and stuff, it looks kind of awesome.
5914814	5917677	So I'm very curious to see if it plays as well as it's advertised.
5917697	5920699	It should limit everybody to one life, and then that way the queue will go faster.
5920819	5921660	Maybe, I don't know.
5921720	5927224	No, I mean, you know it's going to get hammered the first day, but it looks like it's eased up quite a bit, because the queue was only 35.
5927304	5929166	That wouldn't have been that bad.
5929186	5930767	I've seen WoW queues that were worse than that.
5931248	5937192	But yeah, I guess right now, right this second, there's no queue, so some of our listeners might be off to play that.
5937953	5939594	But I will probably check that out a little later tonight.
5940195	5941016	So, we'll see.
5942577	5945121	And I would definitely check out Quake 3 Arena when it hits Xbox Live.
5945141	5946903	That was one of my favorite Quake games was the third one.
5946943	5948785	There's a lot of games like that that are coming out.
5948826	5950428	There's also that other...
5951368	5957510	God, I don't remember the name of it now, but it was the one that they had with the Aegea physics processor at one time.
5958930	5960751	That game, whatever.
5961411	5963591	It's some psychic war game that's going to be coming out.
5963651	5967393	And then I think there's another game very similar to that as well that's supposed to be on its way.
5967413	5972474	So a lot of those arena, Unreal type of tournament stuff coming out for Live Arcade.
5973922	5975182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6003352	6006793	I think they made their way to the Wii eventually with the Strong Bad games.
6006873	6007273	Season 1 did.
6007473	6008233	Yeah.
6008373	6015114	But finally they're going to be making their way to Xbox Live Arcade and this is where people will actually be able to download a demo because demos are mandatory on the Xbox Live games.
6015455	6020796	I think you'll probably finally see these games start to get a lot more of the attention it deserves, at least from the console people.
6020856	6023396	I mean, I know a lot of PC gamers have already found their way to it.
6024236	6025957	But this is going to open it up to a whole new audience.
6026257	6029017	So this is good news and kind of expected in a way.
6029057	6030998	You kind of figured this was going to happen eventually.
6031618	6031718	So...
6032498	6032858	There you go.
6032898	6035641	Sam and Max coming soon to Xbox Live Arcade.
6037102	6040424	Well, I have some interesting news.
6040745	6041085	Oh, really?
6041385	6042706	Has to do with the ESRB.
6043227	6043927	More leaks?
6044628	6044908	Yep.
6046289	6048871	Classic rock track for Rock Band.
6050092	6050993	Isn't that kind of cool?
6051313	6058899	It's supposed to be getting a teen rating and it's actually on there for violent swearing and drug use.
6060581	6060801	So...
6062711	6065933	I think it's just that song pack that they're going to put out of all previously released.
6065953	6071876	They're saying The Joker, Take the Money and Run, and Holiday in Cambodia by the Dead Kennedys.
6072116	6073417	Oh yeah, that's already there.
6073637	6077339	Yeah, it sounds like it's going to be like the rock band track pack one or whatever that is.
6077779	6081261	Those were examples that were given about pretty much kind of the same thing to expect.
6081755	6082175	Gotcha.
6082615	6084116	Too bad they don't have independent achievements.
6085437	6086997	That would make it a lot more worthwhile.
6087277	6091159	You know, I wonder if that ACDC Rock Band game has really fallen in price yet.
6091939	6096261	I'll get it when it's in the bargain bin, but I don't want to pay like... It's all live tracks, too.
6096341	6096881	It's kind of like...
6098622	6101244	I'll check it out just for, you know, because I'm an achievement whore.
6101284	6103805	And the fact that, you know, I don't mind increasing my rock band library.
6103845	6105306	There's a couple good ACDC songs.
6105366	6110210	But, you know, I'm not going to get it until it's in the $5 bin, which you know it will be in Walmart eventually.
6110230	6116213	And when it's in the $5 bin, you buy it, you dump the songs to your hard drive, and then you sell that shit back.
6116334	6116834	There you go.
6117194	6117634	There you go.
6117694	6118275	Now you're talking.
6119275	6121016	That's how we do it.
6121036	6121856	This is how we roll.
6145623	6171597	and we'll be coming to the Wii on April 24th as well and of course these will be available in their bundles I believe or actually maybe just game only right now and then there's also going to be the standalone stuff as well and then I guess they are doing a bundle with the instrument edition which will include the drums, guitar, and microphone
6173127	6177088	I just want to say Unfolded Raptor in chat following up with the Rock Band thing we were talking about just a minute ago.
6177228	6181149	I saw the ACDC at Walmart for $20 in the bargain bin, Rob.
6181229	6181869	Some bargain.
6181989	6182489	Yeah, I agree.
6182529	6185209	That's not that much down from the original asking price, right?
6185229	6187010	Yeah, yeah.
6187030	6192291	But speaking of bargains, HitStun reminds us that Lost Planet on the PC is $5 this weekend on Steam.
6192751	6196552	And that was a deal I was thinking about checking out, but then again, I never really cared for the demo.
6196572	6197672	It's just not my kind of game.
6198012	6200473	I understand why people like Lost Planet, but it's not my kind of thing.
6200493	6202593	I'm thinking about going back and playing Dead Rising again.
6202993	6204014	Oh yeah, Dead Rising is fun.
6204114	6205075	I wish they had multiplayer.
6205095	6206176	I hope they do that in the second one.
6206196	6207116	That would be much fun.
6207136	6207917	They will, I'm sure.
6207997	6208477	They've got to.
6209458	6211620	Alright, so hooray for the UK finally getting Rock Band.
6211920	6216944	Well, in other Rock Band news, obviously there's a lot of PlayStation news this week at Destination PlayStation.
6217504	6219966	This sounds pretty awesome.
6221147	6225150	Rock Band Unplugged is a game that's going to be coming out for the PSP.
6225531	6227132	It's a rock band on a portable console.
6227172	6229534	Very interesting when you consider where did Guitar Hero go?
6230094	6233157	The DS, but now you have Rock Band coming out on the PSP.
6233537	6234218	But guess what?
6234338	6238622	There's not going to be any type of guitar attachment or drum attachment or anything like that.
6239042	6245608	No, apparently a website named Primo Tech apparently has some details about what the gameplay could be like.
6246008	6247189	Take this with a grain of salt.
6247269	6251593	Some of this sounds a little bit like Fanboy Wang to me, but this could be the real deal.
6251733	6255016	I think it's the stuff from Destination PlayStation, probably.
6255316	6259538	Well, also, kind of thinking back a couple weeks ago when they were... Well, let me get to that in a minute.
6259598	6261759	Here's some of the possible gameplay details from this.
6262139	6266661	Apparently, you're going to be using the left, up, triangle, and circle buttons to control instruments.
6267022	6269783	And you also will go from instrument to instrument with the shoulder buttons.
6270223	6276726	And then what you do, you play a segment of a certain instrument to get the score or the multiplier going, and then you switch to a different instrument.
6277286	6277586	Hmm.
6277967	6279427	What game am I describing?
6280468	6282429	Frequency and Amplitude, anybody?
6283345	6290149	And remember a couple weeks ago, there was that guy who made the statement about, oh, we'd love to revisit Frequency or Amplitude someday when the opportunity presents itself.
6290489	6298653	If you kind of, you know, tie that in with this, this definitely seems like a possibility and a pretty good idea for a game.
6298693	6300014	And one I would definitely pick up.
6300134	6301835	This is like Frequency and Amplitude and that stuff.
6301895	6302735	I'm all over this game.
6303476	6303936	All over it.
6305532	6306493	So, hooray to that.
6306534	6308656	And I know a lot of music game fans are very happy about that.
6308697	6313563	Are you a big music game fan in frequency and amplitude, DarkSakura?
6313583	6314164	They're alright.
6314445	6316367	Does it sound like something you might play?
6316788	6317048	Maybe.
6317369	6317589	Maybe?
6318070	6319211	Again, songs are everything.
6319812	6320393	You know, that's...
6321394	6322775	Guitar Hero DS Guitar Hero DS Guitar Hero DS
6338823	6347767	How do we take the Guitar Hero game on the 360 and on the Nintendo Wii and smoosh it down into a DS?
6348247	6356431	Where this is, okay, how do we build a game in the rock band genre on this platform knowing that these are our restrictions?
6356931	6358292	Go.
6358552	6362533	I think that they're taking a completely different approach to it I think will help them create the better game.
6363074	6363534	But we'll see.
6364714	6365935	We shall soon see.
6367349	6368515	Well, how about more stuff?
6369037	6370143	More stuff, my favorite.
6371325	6400127	for iPhone people there are actually two titles that are out by Taito and though they're not Bubble Wobble the first is Cooking Mama where you can use the accelerometer and play your game it's for $6.99 or 5 pounds, 5.5 euro there's also Space Invaders where it's tilt and you can drag and you can use touch screen and there's like bonus character art and stuff and it's like 5 bucks so cool
6402683	6410009	I'm getting a little sick of all the let's take our existing things and push them down into the iPhone.
6411030	6412392	Good point from Actdeft in chat.
6412432	6413913	It's not Space Invaders Extreme.
6414493	6418277	I'm a little worn out on the old school Space Invaders.
6418317	6423362	If it was Space Invaders Extreme with the awesome soundtrack, which the iPhone would be a good platform for, I would be all over that.
6423462	6425163	But it doesn't sound like it.
6427947	6434169	Prince of Persia, the epilogue download content was supposed to have been out already, but it's been delayed to March 5th.
6434649	6435829	Not that long of a wait, though.
6436169	6438030	The price has been announced at $10.
6439350	6448393	And, of course, this game will pick up from the end of the game and hopefully make up, I guess, for what was apparently a crappy ending.
6448453	6448753	I don't know.
6448773	6451754	I never really played to the end of Prince of Persia.
6451774	6453334	Yeah, I didn't get to the end either.
6453814	6455475	Didn't really play Prince of Persia, but...
6456818	6457199	Thanks for watching!
6475686	6475986	I don't know.
6488530	6496232	Well, I'm one of those weird people that has a Netflix account and I hardly ever use it, so it's like just a vacuum sucking my money away because I never watch the movies that they send me.
6496272	6499632	But one thing I do love about Netflix is the streaming Netflix.
6500672	6506554	One thing I like about the streaming versus the DVDs or Blu-ray through the mail is that you don't have to wait for streaming.
6506594	6508574	If you want to watch something, you can watch it right now.
6508614	6510655	You don't have to wait for a disc to be delivered to you.
6511055	6515616	So I love the Xbox 360 streaming, and I'm loving some of these rumors I'm hearing this week.
6516236	6517716	Apparently, Netflix is plagiarizing
6517776	6521918	planning on a streaming-only subscription in the foreseeable future.
6522018	6528402	This comes from a report from Reuters, which is, you know, one of the massive news reporting agencies along with Associated Press.
6528922	6531003	So, yeah, this sounds like it's coming in the future.
6531963	6538207	No word if they're going to expand the amount that's offered on the streaming subscription because, sadly, there isn't a lot available right now.
6538227	6542369	I mean, there's some good, like, NBC TV shows and, you know, there's some
6542709	6544411	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6558663	6558963	Outro Outro
6584415	6584875	DarkSakura.com
6611397	6614159	DarkSakura's gonna pick out a few of her favorite emails and read them for you right now!
6625151	6626691	Dan was very popular on the show.
6626751	6628452	I saw some twits about it too and all that.
6628472	6630192	Janai from Las Vegas, actually.
6631573	6633113	Oh god, stupid thing.
6633153	6635054	Sorry, my plug keeps falling on my laptop.
6636394	6638634	I would like to say episode 312 was hilarious.
6638855	6642015	Dan and Loki's commentary made me fall out of my seat laughing while at work.
6642395	6643996	Dan needs to be on the show more often.
6644016	6645456	He's got a great radio voice too.
6645956	6647657	I love the new OLR website layout.
6647677	6649337	It has a nice citrus look to it.
6649897	6651498	Peace slot machines and sugar cookies.
6651518	6651638	Janai.
6655051	6659432	You know I had an offer to go to Vegas in June, and you know I can't go because it's the same week as E3.
6660252	6660572	Damn it.
6661873	6663053	I really want to go back to Vegas, though.
6663433	6664593	I will make that happen this year.
6666574	6673375	Well, there's just some really, really long emails.
6675596	6680237	The next one comes up from Acidic Vampire.
6681778	6682658	Hello there, OLR.
6682678	6683919	This is Paul, a.k.a.
6683979	6687300	a sick vampire, with my virginal email to you guys.
6688080	6693602	I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm a fairly new listener, been listening since August of last year, and that I enjoy the show immensely.
6693682	6701184	The chemistry between all three hosts, the terrific news, and Loki's disdain for every Imagine game released each week has sold me as an avid listener.
6701464	6702345	Imagine hate.
6703645	6706466	Now that my saccharine praise is out of the way, I do have a valid question.
6707905	6714190	I've only heard Sky mention that he's played this game before, but if DarkSakura or Loki has played this as well, I wouldn't mind their input.
6714270	6718214	After years of being released, I am finally going to attempt to play Final Fantasy XI.
6718814	6723558	For some odd reason, I've been reading about it lately, and I've always put it aside as being one of those games I just had to play.
6724199	6727501	I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, Final Fantasy VI for the win, and I've...
6728482	6734164	But I said cast Final Fantasy XI aside because it was online and required a monthly fee to play.
6734524	6742007	Well, I bought the Venatio collection recently for about $20, which includes all four expansion packs, and I'm ready to get my feet wet and get my farraga on.
6742987	6750290	This will be my first MMORPG, which I fear will exile me from other players on the servers because of my inexperience, which leads to this question.
6750690	6753471	What tips can you give a noob MMORPG player like me?
6754091	6760095	I like to play a TaruTaru Black Mage because they're so damn cute, but I know it'll take forever to level them up.
6760455	6764838	I also like to interact with other players, but I don't want them exciting me just because I'm new to the game.
6765219	6766760	They've been playing the game for five plus years.
6767200	6774005	Any input you have, I'm sorry, any input you or even the chat room can give me would be greatly appreciated.
6774385	6777367	Thanks for your time, and here's to another 300 shows.
6777547	6778368	Gay gamers unite.
6779789	6780309	I'll leave that to you.
6780349	6781510	I played, but I didn't like it.
6782304	6784085	Yeah, turn around and run while you still can.
6784506	6786668	Do not allow yourself to get sucked into this game.
6786768	6787509	Now, you know what?
6787569	6789511	I've heard a lot's changed since the time I left.
6789531	6789831	You know what?
6789911	6795958	Loki, actually, Loki did spend just as long as I did in the clutches of Vanadil, if not a little longer.
6796678	6797659	I don't know, Loki.
6797940	6798921	What was your thoughts?
6799727	6800227	I liked it.
6800408	6800968	It was fun.
6802429	6806412	It sucked waiting for parties.
6806512	6813216	Now that they fixed having to party with people, I think that would be a lot more fun now.
6814737	6816359	That was kind of the thing that broke it for me.
6816379	6818160	Well, other than I didn't have time to play.
6818180	6821762	It's just waiting for a party.
6821782	6823624	You're like, okay, I have two hours to play this.
6824659	6825120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6845262	6845683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6867025	6870866	3-4 months after I left, they finally started banning people for it and they're pretty aggressive about it.
6870906	6877248	Now granted, you'll never eliminate it, but I'm sure that's helped the economy tremendously in that game because the guild sellers were ruining the game.
6877748	6881309	But it's just unfortunate that Square let it go on so long.
6881329	6885991	They lost some people like me because they just weren't more aggressive with it.
6886751	6887091	I don't know.
6887751	6891192	I feel like I can't give the game a fair review, but dude, you already bought the pack.
6891252	6892653	It comes with a free month of the game.
6893473	6894133	Go install it.
6894174	6894754	Have a blast.
6894814	6897736	I'm almost curious to see how it would run on my PC now.
6898136	6898496	Yeah, I know.
6898536	6899937	I bet it would look nice.
6900017	6900558	But I don't know.
6901398	6902719	You know, one thing I prefer.
6903019	6903680	I'll tell you something.
6903700	6907262	To be fair, I'll tell you something I prefer on Final Fantasy XI compared to WoW.
6907922	6910824	I like exploring in Final Fantasy XI a lot more.
6910984	6913586	And it's weird because the graphics aren't necessarily better.
6913646	6914546	They're just a different type.
6914927	6919830	But, like, when you go into a new world in Final Fantasy XI, like a place you've never been before, it's like, oh, wow.
6919850	6920230	It's scary.
6920330	6921072	DarkSakura,
6929194	6932157	Final Fantasy XI, you really get a sense of exploration in that game.
6932697	6934679	The world is so vast in that game.
6934799	6940383	It's not that WoW doesn't have its own neat levels and areas and things like that, but I don't know.
6940483	6945127	There's something about Final Fantasy XI where I feel more sense of an accomplishment when it comes to exploring.
6945227	6947188	WoW takes itself more seriously, I think.
6947328	6949931	Final Fantasy XI takes itself more seriously than WoW.
6956055	6958776	Hitstun asked in chat, so what happened to make WoW suck now?
6959196	6960277	Actually, WoW doesn't suck.
6960677	6966260	I don't have a problem with WoW at all, but I just had to quit because I was spending too much time on it.
6966500	6967241	Or take a vacation.
6967261	6969622	I don't want to say I quit because that makes it sound like I'm never going to go back.
6969642	6970162	That's not the case.
6970182	6971583	I'm actually probably going to go back pretty soon.
6972584	6974945	But I just needed a break to do other things.
6976045	6976526	So, hooray.
6978547	6979467	Alright, next email then.
6979888	6980548	Next email.
6983194	6986758	Hey, LLR, I have a request for the new GameStop hate board.
6986798	6989500	They don't sell classic games or system anymore.
6989960	6992423	I was too young when they did, and I got into classic gaming.
6992463	6994745	They send them off to the warehouse to gather dust.
6995125	6997427	So F you to GameStop for lack of classic video games.
6997487	6998968	How dare they call themselves a game store?
6999048	6999749	That's from Cheeseburger.
7000770	7001791	Good suggestion.
7001831	7005995	Unfortunately, the whiteboard's down for repairs right now, but we will definitely add that when it comes back.
7006815	7007076	Okay.
7010236	7013730	Alright, one from Spacinator, and then I'm going to read the long, long one after that.
7015151	7017653	Hi folks, I'm writing in today with a few questions and comments.
7017753	7020795	Firstly, although perhaps it's not a big deal, but I'll address it anyway.
7020815	7025177	I'd like to apologize for the mess of an email that I sent last week with the poor grammar and spelling.
7025217	7026758	Don't worry about it, I'm giving a hard time.
7027178	7041647	Normally I take the time to make sure everything's correct, but considering that I was typing in a hurry and the fact that PlayOnline has no spellcheck, and the fact that my glucose levels were out of whack at the time, side note, I'm diabetic and abnormal glucose levels cause me to get confused, that all ended up being a factor in the issue.
7041888	7042268	I... I...
7043391	7046807	I give everybody a hard time, it's not serious
7047458	7048839	She's an equal opportunity offender.
7049439	7050059	Oh, bite me.
7050980	7053561	Now that issue's out of the way, here's a few questions.
7053821	7064947	One, can you recall any events in your lives or wow moments that basically you had you think to yourself something along the lines of yes, video games is a hobby that I want to get into.
7065247	7069590	For me, it's the first time I've set foot into a showbiz pizza place formerly a competitor of Chuck E. Cheese's.
7070630	7074832	They're actually owned by Pizza Time Entertainment that was started by...
7077472	7078813	Fuck.
7078873	7080155	I don't think it was started by Fuck.
7081095	7082337	Nolan Bushnell.
7083658	7085539	I sort of let you suffer a little bit before I helped you.
7090264	7091705	It was going to my friend's house.
7092186	7094308	No shit, because I was little and into games.
7095989	7099052	I was born playing video games practically.
7101155	7118856	I just played a lot of Odyssey 2 when I was little little and I never thought about wow I'd like to do this as a hobby it just sort of happened you know I was a little kid you know when all of this was new and interesting but it was just more like
7120293	7122236	Hey, look, Mom brought home a ColecoVision.
7122256	7122836	That's cool.
7123577	7127582	Oh, I'm going to go play Kix during break at school.
7128984	7132648	It just didn't factor in as a wow.
7132669	7135132	It was just a part of my life, always.
7135192	7136774	So, not a big deal.
7137675	7137815	Rob?
7139758	7141119	I'm sorry, what are we answering?
7141299	7146463	What was your, wow, I really like video games, you know, what got you into video games pretty much?
7146903	7147584	Oh, God.
7148865	7149946	I'm almost in the same boat.
7149986	7156290	Like, I just remember the day we hooked up the Atari 2600 and just the fact that I was interacting with it.
7156350	7160813	Or, no, it really was the Commodore 64, I think, that really got me into games.
7160833	7161154	And just...
7162254	7163055	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7181954	7190481	I was kind of an only child, not really.
7190962	7200649	But one reason I played video games is because I didn't have other kids to set up and play board games with or go out and play on the lawn with.
7200689	7203572	I mean, granted, I had neighborhood friends and stuff, but they don't want to hang out every day.
7203972	7206174	So video games were a way to pass time.
7206794	7207555	It would entertain me.
7208175	7210577	There weren't always a lot of other people around, if that makes sense.
7212258	7213478	Loki, anything for you?
7214139	7215279	Why are you into video games?
7215680	7218101	I don't know, because I always played video games.
7219202	7220342	I know, it's tough.
7220382	7223825	I don't want to say it's just a tough question.
7223905	7226386	It's just having video games from when I was four or five.
7227207	7229348	That pretty much, I'll do it.
7231169	7236873	You look at the stuff that you did when you were a little kid and you end up looking at it now and you're doing the same stuff.
7238515	7243258	I liked tinkering with things and playing video games and messing around on a computer.
7244199	7246580	And sure enough, I'm doing the same damn stuff now.
7247341	7249662	We were just all born with a controller in our hand, apparently.
7249822	7250563	So there you have it.
7250851	7251071	Driver 3
7272085	7274267	Driver 3 is the best worst game ever.
7275087	7276748	It's just so bad.
7276788	7279070	In fact, I was talking with my sister yesterday about that.
7279090	7282092	She's like, I gotta go back and play Driver 3 again.
7282873	7288076	She'd basically just play the game, drive around, do stupid shit, and then watch the replay.
7288416	7298784	Because the best part about it, the game was so glitchy anyways that the replays were funny, but sometimes the replays would even glitch out even more, so your character would do really crazy stuff.
7299564	7303388	Driver 3, absolutely a horrible game that's funny to play.
7304069	7306231	That don't shit your pants game was pretty bad, but funny.
7308032	7308672	Pagel on Xbox Live Arcade
7336980	7351296	but right now it's all about Bejeweled Blitz on Facebook but nobody else I have the shitty team score because nobody else plays every week like me but I try to get a new score every week so if you do play you should add me on Facebook because I need a higher team score so there you go
7353297	7356359	Well, the third part of this email?
7356560	7356700	Yep.
7356940	7363765	In your opinion, what are the odds of Square Enix re-releasing Final Fantasy XI for one or more of the current gen systems?
7364305	7369469	I know they're really big on re-releasing the other Final Fantasy games, so are they re-releasing Final Fantasy VII?
7370210	7372572	So re-releasing Final Fantasy VII should be a no-brainer.
7373192	7379397	Although not everyone may agree on this, Final Fantasy VII is possibly the most popular... I think he meant...
7379817	7380858	re-releasing Final Fantasy 7.
7380958	7383241	I was going to say, 11's already on 360.
7383481	7391749	Final Fantasy 7 is probably the most popular and memorable game of the series, so re-releasing that game would seem like a virtual license to print a shit ton of money.
7392210	7393691	Who wouldn't want free money, you know?
7394832	7396274	Well, thanks for reading and answering this email.
7396294	7396894	Sorry it's so long.
7399437	7399837	They should.
7400938	7401359	I'd play it.
7402940	7403761	I'm kind of torn.
7403801	7407323	Yes, they should, but I'd rather they just freaking finish Final Fantasy XIII.
7407383	7410304	I'm also interested in some of the new directions that Final Fantasy is going.
7410745	7416328	I wish they would have released Final Fantasy XII on the PlayStation 3 and not the PS2, because I never finished it on PS2.
7417408	7421371	And I think if it had been on the newer consoles, I would have probably spent more time with it.
7421411	7423472	I know that seems so silly, but it's what it is.
7424452	7426413	There you go.
7426473	7426774	I don't know.
7426834	7428234	Loki, you think they ought to re-release VII?
7428555	7428675	No.
7429508	7430889	No, it's a classic the way it is.
7431289	7435511	I think they do need to just put it out on the download thing already on PlayStation Network.
7435831	7437052	That I think they need to do.
7438413	7439994	Just wait until XIII comes out.
7440034	7440634	They may do that.
7441274	7442715	Yeah, I could see that.
7443736	7449779	But then again, why wouldn't you at least do it a couple months in advance so people can play through Final Fantasy VII before XIII comes out?
7455002	7462948	GameGuru says this in chat, hopefully if not a remake, they put it on PSN or Steam.
7462988	7463989	Kind of the same thing I'm thinking of.
7464569	7469173	The Last Remnant, of course, we heard is coming to Steam, which implies the whole Square partnership with Steam now.
7469594	7473217	Hopefully they will release some of the old PC classics on Steam, but we'll see.
7473877	7474578	I'm not going to hold my breath.
7474598	7477322	There's also that good old games distribution.
7477362	7478463	Didn't Eidos put them out?
7479485	7481347	Didn't Eidos do the ports for PC?
7481708	7482128	I don't remember.
7482148	7482709	I could be wrong.
7482829	7483530	I didn't play them.
7484031	7486634	I just... Slightly better graphics.
7487595	7487936	I don't know.
7490723	7491263	Last email?
7492123	7493544	This one's long.
7494184	7498266	Dear Rob, Jamie, and Matt, I've been a long-time listener of your show and count it among my favorites.
7498687	7503369	In fact, when you do miss a show infrequently as it is, it leaves me feeling out of place.
7503729	7505570	It's as if I've gone to work wearing just one sock.
7506231	7509812	Your unique mixture of news commentary and charm are an important part of my week.
7510153	7514075	This is my first letter to you, so I thought I'd start out by thanking you all...
7515375	7518198	Thank you for all you've provided during the years.
7518358	7520799	As an older gamer like yourselves, I'm not older.
7521340	7522221	Okay, I'm kidding.
7522501	7523041	Maybe a little.
7523401	7527464	I understand the difficulty in trying to balance work, family, and the passion we feel for our hobby.
7528625	7533369	Add a weekly show with pre- and post-production on top of that, and I'm amazed you've been at it for as long as you have.
7533729	7534750	Anyway, enough of me gushing.
7535070	7535630	So are we.
7537332	7537972	But no, thank you.
7538232	7538813	That means a lot.
7539873	7552291	Recently, I came across a comment made by John Kohler, head of Sony PSP Hardware Marketing in North America, which suggested that the majority of Nintendo DSes are purchased by or for 12-year-olds.
7552471	7555816	Obviously, this was meant to insult the DS handheld fanbase.
7556738	7558880	But that aside, how much of the statement is true?
7559401	7565369	I've searched the web for data on Nintendo demographics as they break down by age group and have a hard time finding any recent results.
7565910	7571378	Most comments are anecdotal with an equal number of people saying they see more PSPs to DSs
7572038	7578681	among their above 12 age group as exist folks insisting there are more DSs in their circle.
7579181	7584464	The closest I came to anything was an article on GayGamer.net from 2007 reporting that, according to the MPD,
7587885	7612099	Nintendo had increased their sales figure among women by 42% 127% among people who age 30 and older and 212% among people 35 and older I don't know if that's just for the month of April or if it was since the last study had been made I know maybe this really isn't that big of a deal but I'm curious to know if these assertions have any factual base Kohler's claim just doesn't seem right to me
7613968	7615769	I completely disagree with Kohler.
7616350	7622453	I see more people who have DSs than they do PSPs.
7622533	7627695	Now I'm seeing more guys in their early 20s who have PSPs.
7627895	7628636	That I will say.
7629356	7632598	But you get it 25 and up.
7632758	7638641	And you get kids and all kinds of... I think more people and more families have a DS.
7639801	7640482	That's how I see it.
7641943	7649448	My brother and sister-in-law, Dan's brother and sister, they each have their own DS.
7650248	7652210	Now they're little, but then again, my...
7654192	7655193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7673729	7678333	Dan and I each have our own DS, but we have one PSP.
7691690	7692310	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7710455	7711116	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7737921	7748610	But the PSP does not have a lot for that same casual, I don't eat, live, sleep, breathe games, but I like to enjoy a game once in a while market.
7748950	7752814	There's not a lot of great puzzlers, casual games outside of Luminous.
7753775	7755356	The movie thing didn't work out so well.
7756177	7762562	So unless you have somebody that really wants that all-in-one system, and I don't know, if you held up, like if I were a parent,
7763035	7763335	There's more.
7763355	7763435	Me.
7788948	7791049	I should add that I am a DS owner over 12.
7791830	7799274	I do not own a PSP currently, but would eagerly buy one should any of the rumors regarding the PSP2 second analog stick be realized.
7799935	7803537	I own both a 360 and a PS3 and enjoy them equally.
7803897	7808560	In an ideal world, all three companies will do well and continue to provide quality entertainment for the gaming public.
7809000	7809581	So what do you think?
7809821	7813223	Is his comment just so much as claptrap, or is he right?
7813583	7818486	And must all adult DS owners hang their heads in shame for being attached to a kiddie system?
7818926	7820227	I obviously say that in jest.
7820648	7823209	As long as the games are fun, what does it really matter?
7823309	7827272	How much fun can we have even with a speak-and-spell bottle of vodka and grown-up vocabulary?
7828753	7830774	Hey, I'm not going to say I ain't done yet.
7830794	7831234	F-U-C...
7833763	7836645	In closing, I want to add that I like the new site design.
7836785	7840927	It's been a long time coming, but it looks sweet and seems to load faster than the old one.
7841327	7842368	Yay, Deakman!
7842856	7844838	Nice decision to keep the orange background too.
7845438	7849841	If I have a complaint, it's that the episodes on iTunes seem to be a week or two off.
7850261	7851983	Last week's episode was from February 8th.
7852063	7854344	Does that mean that this week's show will be available March 16th or later?
7854504	7856126	No, it's getting caught up now.
7856206	7861710	I was having some problems because now when I do a podcast, I have to do it in two different places as opposed to before.
7862090	7865092	So it was just confusing me a little bit, but I'm good now.
7865132	7870096	I got another one up today, and another one is edited and ready to go, and then we'll be all caught up.
7870396	7871096	So I'm excited.
7872299	7876165	I know I keep saying we're all going to get caught up, but then the new site kind of threw that all out of whack.
7876726	7877447	But it's a good thing.
7877648	7878930	I mean, overall, it's a great thing.
7879451	7880733	And we're getting back on track.
7887206	7888187	We'll keep up the good work.
7888347	7890007	In the meantime, a loyal listener, Raymond.
7890067	7890408	P.S.
7890908	7892769	I, too, quit WoW after two years.
7892909	7895610	One level 80, two level 70s.
7896671	7904835	I don't regret the time I spent there, but the opportunities are now open to me to experience all different kinds of gaming from Dragon Quest V to Flower to Gears of War 2.
7904895	7906676	It was liberating and daunting.
7906836	7907897	That's an interesting combination.
7908617	7913379	So many new games, so many old games to catch up on, and only so many hours available in the day.
7913479	7914900	I'm still open to MMOs, though.
7915300	7918602	Maybe one of the superhero games or the Star Wars one will entice me back.
7918682	7919902	It all depends on the community.
7920262	7921223	Play Star Trek with us!
7922603	7928906	You know, that closing statement is pretty much essentially one of the big reasons why I quit WoW, right there.
7929446	7931647	It's now allowed me to play other games.
7932047	7932588	You know what I mean?
7934020	7935241	Same type of deal, dude.
7935261	7940647	I probably would never have played Flower or some of these other games I've been playing if I had a raid to do tonight.
7940867	7941308	You know what I mean?
7943631	7943811	Yep.
7944795	7949697	I just don't want to be tied to an MMO the way I'd be tied to, like, my job.
7966442	7970544	If you want to send an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do it.
7970884	7980389	We're going to take your calls in just a little bit, but first we have a few more quick stories for you guys, and then we'll get to the Skype line and get towards closing out our show for tonight.
7980449	7980889	So, Loki.
7982029	7986571	There is some new download content for a rather old Command & Conquer game.
7986911	7992954	Command & Conquer Generals is getting a brand new download pack.
7993214	7996275	I guess it's Black Sheep, The Lost Mission.
7999877	8006759	It's interesting that this game is from 2003 and they're doing some download content for it now.
8008919	8009679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8037302	8042107	and you're supposed to crop dust a town that's been corrupted beyond salvation.
8044890	8045110	Huh.
8045765	8046446	Diablo 2 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 5
8071045	8081573	I used to have it a long long time ago but I can't find the CD which sucks because if I could then I could enter in that code on Blizzard's website or whatever now and just download it I think.
8083387	8086689	Final Fantasy Final Fantasy Final Fantasy
8105859	8106640	Thanks for watching!
8124075	8136081	The defendants altogether issued a joint statement saying that they regret that they have sold these copies to consumers and they would have never imported the stuff in the first place if they knew that Squeenix would respond so aggressively to stop them.
8136601	8138442	They will never make this mistake again.
8138962	8139323	Sorry.
8139783	8151889	I bet you anything this Final Fantasy XIII poster we have in studio, you can probably barely see it on JustinTV, but right there where I'm pointing, it's behind the new penguins thing, that poster is a Final Fantasy XIII poster and I bet you anything
8152589	8153649	It's a bootleg.
8154129	8154970	Of course it's a bootleg.
8155010	8159230	It's probably from one of these companies that just got the $600,000 judgment.
8159791	8162051	I like what Dark Tatsuya says in chat.
8162271	8163411	$600,000 judgment sounds like a game.
8164652	8167272	Might be like a new limit break in Final Fantasy XIII, who knows.
8167872	8176514	So if you are counterfeiting Final Fantasy products and selling them for your own profit, you might want to stop before you get the next SmackDown.
8178214	8180755	So I don't know, DarkSakura, are you forging any Final Fantasy goods?
8182382	8182682	No.
8183062	8184623	Alright, well then you have nothing to worry about.
8185063	8185903	But how about another story?
8186683	8187523	Well, I could do that.
8189044	8191324	Xbox Live Arcade Awards.
8193565	8199026	So basically you can vote and voting stops on Tuesday, March 10th.
8199506	8204268	The voting starts on March 3rd, so you've got that window to cast your vote for what you like best.
8204988	8209349	So we've got here's your, I guess, sort of virtual sample ballot.
8210029	8217959	Best overall arcade game is Braid, Castle Crashers, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2, Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, or Portal Still Alive.
8218720	8222625	Best original game would be Castle Crashers and Plus, is that it?
8223726	8226750	Braid, Penny Arcade Episode 1, Schizoid, Age of Booty.
8227771	8234193	Best Family Game, Boogie Bunnies, Rugu, A Kingdom for Calflings, Lost Cities, and Medias Wars.
8235613	8243595	Best Co-op, Multiplayer, Castle Crashers, Schizoid Bionic Commando Rearmed, and Plus, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2.
8243975	8254138	Best Competitive, Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, Geometry Wars, Soul Calibur, Medias Wars, Age of Booty, Best Solo, Braid, Mega Man 9, Penny Arcade,
8254858	8270170	ResHD, Portal Still Alive, Best Innovation in Xbox Live Arcade, Braid for Time Travel, Kingdom for Keflings, Use of Avatars, Fable 2, Pub Games, Retail Game Integration, N Plus, Level Sharing, and Duke Nukem 3D Dynamic Replay.
8271271	8284182	Best Graphics, Street Fighter 2, Geometry Wars, Braid, Castle Crashers, Bionic Commando, Best Classic Remake Game, Bionic Commando, Street Fighter 2, Mega Man 9, Galaga Legions, and ResHD.
8285487	8287248	So go cast a vote then.
8287468	8288568	Vote for RezHD a lot.
8288588	8291790	But at the same time, I don't think our listeners should be voting in this poll.
8291890	8292870	Because you know why?
8292950	8294151	And I have a right to say this.
8294191	8301074	Because I'm looking at the OLR March Madness thing going on, and apparently Tetris is currently beating Super Metroid, which is stupid.
8301494	8304916	And I know this is happening mostly in part to the whole debacle from last year.
8304956	8305996	I knew this was going to happen.
8306057	8307177	People want their revenge on me.
8308358	8309158	But you know what?
8310503	8310743	1-877-GAME-OLR
8331604	8333605	I got to vote for Tetris now.
8333945	8335045	You're such an asshole.
8335785	8336665	No, I'm just kidding.
8337466	8343827	I am not voting for Tetris because, you know what, as much as I like Tetris, Super Metroid gets my vote.
8344708	8345168	Good job.
8346608	8349289	And... Super Metroid pulls ahead!
8349569	8350109	Alright!
8350129	8351790	Yeah, high five, Loki!
8351830	8352810	Yeah, good job, Loki!
8357406	8357966	Alright, anyhow.
8358687	8361209	A couple more news stories and we're going to wrap up tonight, Loki.
8361809	8362610	Sorry.
8362670	8364811	That's alright, I understand.
8365312	8367713	More Grand Theft Auto possibly on the PSP.
8367773	8370335	Apparently Sony is in talks with Rockstar.
8370715	8375079	They want some more games for their PSP system and you know what, I'm down with that.
8375239	8377180	Let's get some San Andreas stories going on.
8379244	8379984	Thanks for watching!
8409249	8415111	Be honest, I mean, the Giant Town Wars stuff, it's going to be good, but it's no PSP, you know, Grand Theft Auto games.
8415171	8421033	Those were, you know, just like the PlayStation 2 ones, and I hope they do another one.
8421933	8422254	I really do.
8422274	8425395	But is Grand Theft Auto the type of thing you really want to play on your PSP, Loki?
8425435	8426495	I mean, you're a Grand Theft Auto fan.
8426515	8427015	Yeah, really?
8427055	8429156	We played the PSP version for months.
8429916	8431117	The multiplayer was fun.
8432637	8434318	And yes, it is something I would play on my PSP.
8436033	8436897	for long hours.
8437901	8439347	And it's also fun to hack apart.
8441018	8441598	for long hours.
8441998	8445560	I'd like to see a Saints Row on PSP, but no, that wouldn't happen.
8445640	8447161	Or even Crackdown on PSP.
8447201	8447761	That'd be awesome.
8447901	8449082	Anything sandbox-ish.
8450022	8454944	Hell, Atari or Ubisoft or whoever owns Driver, make another Driver game.
8455145	8456765	You don't have to put any effort into it.
8456805	8457746	Just make another Driver game.
8457766	8459346	Make it crap like the last one.
8460347	8463508	Well, their last game I didn't really play, but make it like Driver 3.
8464149	8465749	Just reissue Driver 3.
8465989	8466870	Make no changes.
8469614	8474136	All right, and finally tonight, this is something interesting.
8474176	8481780	Apparently, a 60-year-old woman got held hostage at gunpoint for 10 hours in Brazil this week.
8481820	8485962	This was reported from Globo.com, apparently broke this story.
8486402	8490284	But here's the part that makes it interesting and somewhat game-related.
8490564	8495947	The gun that was used, a Sega Light Phaser from the old Sega Master System.
8496547	8498768	Of course, Sega is still a huge presence in Brazil.
8498788	8500609	The Master System is still marketed in Brazil.
8500649	8506492	That's right, so no surprise that the Sega Light Phaser was the light gun of choice.
8506572	8510054	However, dude tried to hold somebody up with a light gun.
8512215	8514716	And they didn't figure out that this was a fake-looking gun?
8515336	8516197	It's a 60-year-old woman.
8517377	8523640	The man did release the hostage, good for him, negotiated with police, and there you go.
8524301	8524501	So...
8527081	8534580	I don't know, idiots like this, anybody that uses video game equipment to hold people hostage deserves to have the FUs of the week dedicated to them.
8550649	8558812	My FU goes to this site for not recognizing my password or giving me any way to immediately change my password.
8559813	8560093	The end.
8562214	8564194	Um, I don't really have a lot of FUs of the week.
8564234	8565675	I've actually been in a pretty good mood.
8565815	8566875	So, um, I don't know.
8567056	8569056	FU to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow.
8569136	8570657	Although, you know, I like my job and all.
8570777	8572058	You know, I'm just lazy.
8572318	8573918	I would rather stay at home than play video games.
8574358	8574939	So FU to that.
8575379	8575659	Loki.
8576599	8578000	Um, FU to the rain still.
8578615	8582617	For some reason, the way the weather patterns are, they're starting on Sundays.
8583177	8584038	Always Sundays.
8584458	8586419	Always the day I'm going to play Airsoft.
8587059	8587599	Why?
8587919	8588760	Why must you do this?
8589200	8591501	You know, to be honest, I don't really care too much anymore, though.
8591781	8593382	Especially after this week being sick.
8594882	8599825	But it still sucks, you know, that I've been waiting for like over a month now to play.
8600545	8604547	And unfortunately, it's not going to be any different for the next few weeks either, so...
8605663	8606784	Ugh, stupid rain.
8606824	8608445	At least rain during the week.
8608705	8610627	Give me the weekends off, okay?
8611347	8614289	You can rain all week long, but just give me Sunday.
8614529	8615970	That's the only day I want.
8616631	8619032	Can we come up with some sort of compromise, Mother Nature?
8619173	8619533	Seriously.
8621866	8622246	All right.
8623867	8626007	Nice and short FUs of the Week segment tonight.
8626107	8626768	Thank you very much.
8627288	8630469	How about we open up the Skype line and take some calls?
8630489	8632229	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.
8632930	8637211	Or you can call us on Skype at username OrangeLoungeRadio.
8637691	8640852	Or you can give us a call right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8641012	8642873	And we will take a couple of your calls tonight.
8642933	8645834	And then we're going to wrap it up and call it a night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8647195	8662665	and of course we'll be back at the same time next week join us sometime for a live taping Sunday night 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time 9 o'clock Eastern Time right after the Bobby Blackwolf show on All Games Radio www.allgames.com but let's go ahead and go to the phones we have a call hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
8664546	8669129	it's DT wow I made it first hi congratulations DT what is on your mind?
8669349	8674653	and you were on the show last week of course but here you are now calling in by phone what's on your mind tonight buddy?
8676673	8678296	Oh, something I forgot to plug.
8679058	8679398	Okay.
8682084	8683927	The Indie Gaming Spotlight, Episode 1.
8684188	8684248	Uh...
8688278	8689939	Yes, I noticed this on the website.
8690019	8696702	One of the neat new features now that we have more people that know how to update the website and are excited to use it to update things.
8697663	8703205	I noticed that DarkTetsuya started the indie spotlight on the site, which was kind of an idea we were kicking around.
8703245	8712130	And of course, the first game he highlighted, of course, La Mulana, because I know he's dropped thousands and thousands of hours into the MSX wannabe game.
8713410	8716632	But yeah, any hints as to what's coming up soon on the indie spotlight?
8719422	8721043	I was thinking of doing a version.
8721083	8722725	That one keeps coming up.
8723865	8724226	Okay.
8724446	8724726	All right.
8725166	8726387	Now, here's my question.
8726447	8728849	We might have some indie developers that listen to this show.
8728969	8732551	How can they get themselves featured on Orange Lounge Radio Indie Spotlight?
8734673	8738135	Just drop me a line at darktotsuya at gmail.com.
8739196	8739436	All right.
8739476	8741097	I think we have a thread in the forums too, right?
8742778	8742998	Yep.
8744039	8744259	All right.
8744299	8745260	Well, anything else you want to plug?
8745300	8746741	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
8746781	8748302	Any video games you've been playing lately?
8750277	8751498	I just want to need some speed.
8751518	8754400	I want to check out the world online if it launches here in the U.S.
8754440	8754800	I don't know.
8754920	8757402	I'm not on Steam.
8757422	8757762	No, that's it.
8777890	8778790	Thank you for reminding me.
8778830	8780710	I should have plugged it last week when it went up.
8780770	8781331	So there you go.
8781891	8789673	If you want to check that out, Indie Spotlight, week one featuring La Mulana, which has almost become a bit of an OLR inside joke.
8789713	8791473	So check it out at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8791493	8791693	Yep.
8792794	8792974	All right.
8792994	8793454	Take care, Joe.
8795154	8795514	You too.
8795915	8796755	All right.
8796775	8798695	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call.
8799556	8801376	Or on Skype, it's Orange Lounge Radio.
8801936	8803257	And we got another call already coming in.
8803297	8804337	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8804357	8804697	Who's this?
8805546	8808228	Hey, it's Ranma, and I finally made it through after like two weeks.
8808368	8811111	I know, it's been kind of crazy the past couple weeks, but that's okay.
8811131	8814334	You know, we have to take calls from different people, you know, we gotta mix it up a little bit.
8814594	8815214	What's on your mind, Ranma?
8815254	8815635	Yeah, Baron.
8816576	8818117	Sky, I want you to know something.
8818537	8818757	What?
8819618	8822040	You almost killed me about two hours ago.
8822741	8823081	How?
8824322	8826044	Your comment about Foodie Monster.
8826264	8829287	I was eating chips and drinking soda when you said that.
8830137	8832318	The sad thing is I don't even think he's listening tonight.
8832939	8836621	He's not, and no one's made a comment to Twitter about it to him either.
8836821	8843126	Hopefully somebody will bring it to his attention that he ought to listen to tonight's show, because I'm sure I'll get a nasty Twitter email about it.
8844847	8846368	If no one else does it, I will.
8847008	8848469	All right, you get to it.
8848749	8850050	Hey, no cons this weekend?
8851551	8853353	I'm done with the cons for the month.
8853413	8854373	I did Comic-Con.
8854413	8855394	I did Catacomb.
8855654	8857135	I did Wicked Winter Ren Faire.
8857255	8859637	I'm on break until the end of March.
8860745	8862006	Nice long break for you.
8862987	8864268	Something like that.
8864328	8866330	Speaking of cons, have you been to Video Games Live?
8866350	8867091	It's like a mini-con.
8868004	8868664	Not yet.
8868724	8874386	When it came around my way, I just didn't have the money, and to be perfectly honest, I wasn't really that interested at the time.
8874706	8879908	You know, I would say, they do a costume contest, and there were only like three people that dressed up.
8880128	8886850	So like, if you did your Black Luigi thing, or heck, any of your video game related costumes, I think you'd have a good shot to win like a DS or something like that.
8887690	8888650	I'll check that out.
8888830	8889311	You should.
8889511	8890511	I bet you could do very well.
8891780	8900108	And speaking of conventions, when you talked about the Square Enix swords, it would not be surprising that I still see them at the conventions or whatever's left.
8900348	8902170	The price would just go double to triple.
8902550	8907815	Believe it or not, they're cheaper than getting them done, commissioned by actual prop makers.
8908135	8908735	Probably.
8909556	8910057	Probably.
8911098	8911378	Yeah.
8911698	8912259	Is this true?
8912379	8915161	I see Breslow in chat saying you are going to SakuraCon.
8915201	8916522	True or false?
8916582	8917143	No, I'm not.
8917864	8917984	Oh.
8919338	8920918	I kind of want to go to SakuraCon.
8920938	8923059	I love Seattle, but I also want to go to PAX.
8923459	8924299	So, I don't know.
8924399	8927480	And flights aren't always necessarily that cheap.
8927520	8928081	But I don't know.
8928601	8930021	I might be able to come to SakuraCon.
8931161	8934562	Maybe if Bress Lowell will let me crash his place on the couch or something.
8936043	8937883	As long as you don't violate him in his sleep.
8938243	8938884	I promise.
8940084	8940604	I'll be good.
8940624	8944205	He can't violate me in my sleep.
8944285	8945285	Why are you telling me?
8945726	8947126	He needs to not violate me.
8948800	8952441	I want you guys to know that you guys covered an article
8969608	8972369	Last week that you covered three years ago.
8972669	8976811	You know, sometimes those oddities happen, but what was the article, just for fun?
8977451	8979692	Final Fantasy X port on the NES.
8980912	8981372	Really?
8981492	8982433	That had come up before?
8982453	8983213	I thought it was recent.
8983273	8987275	I remember there was a VII port on the DS a few years ago.
8987315	8990056	Final Fantasy VII, but I didn't remember a X port.
8990636	8991416	So that's why we did it.
8991436	8993317	No, it was X, because someone posted it.
8993337	8995718	I followed the link, and I'm like, this is X, yeah.
8996644	8997224	Interesting.
8997545	8998505	Eh, well, it happens.
8998905	8999285	Whatever.
9000086	9003488	You know, we're not perfect, and the show's been going a long time.
9003568	9006029	We can't remember every story we've ever done.
9006089	9006710	It's gonna happen.
9007650	9008350	That's fine.
9008410	9010031	I mean, I had no problem with that.
9010051	9010832	That was pretty cool.
9011152	9015534	Yeah, you know, and of course, you know, we don't have the same listeners now that we had three years ago, either.
9015574	9020477	Thankfully, we have some of the faithfuls, like yourself, and there's some others that have been listening to the show for a long, long time.
9020517	9021998	There's also a lot of new faces, too, so...
9023208	9024188	Yeah, definitely.
9024629	9031510	So, you know, at some point, DarkSakura might actually run out of classic games to talk about.
9031570	9032871	So we're going to have to figure something out.
9032891	9033911	That's not likely going to happen.
9034051	9035711	I doubt that.
9035992	9036332	All right.
9036852	9037452	Be a long time.
9038452	9038752	All right.
9038832	9041233	Well, Ranma, any other thoughts for us before you get to another call?
9042526	9054717	Last thing, in regards to the whole match game debacle from a month ago, when you guys have the next contest, my group, Anime Jam Session, we want to donate a couple of prizes for the winners.
9055558	9056038	Sweet!
9057119	9058361	Definitely, we'll make that happen.
9058601	9062785	I don't know when we'll play match game again, but we'll try to get some guests to come in studio and we'll make that happen.
9063476	9068981	Yes, because I posted a link in the chat room for these shirts that we made called Grand Theft Chocobo.
9069721	9070122	Awesome.
9070282	9071043	I want that shirt.
9071843	9075727	It's available in Xbox 360 White and PlayStation 3 Black.
9076047	9076567	Very nice.
9076807	9077328	Nice pitch.
9077388	9077568	Yes.
9077628	9078009	There you go.
9078249	9079490	What's the website where I can order one?
9080431	9082412	Secret-Shop.com.
9082572	9083073	There you go.
9083974	9086015	All right, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
9086035	9086876	But take care, buddy, okay?
9087337	9087897	Okay, you too.
9088037	9088277	Love you.
9088478	9088678	Later.
9088938	9089138	Bye.
9089919	9090179	All right.
9092601	9106552	Super Mario Kart, according to Guinness Book of World Records, has compiled the top 50 console games of all time.
9107033	9113698	And Super Mario Kart, apparently, has the longest legacy and the biggest impact on video games in all of history.
9113758	9117421	And that is according to, again, the Guinness Book of World Records.
9117441	9118622	They need to get out of video games.
9118962	9119502	No.
9119522	9125345	2, Tetris 3, Grand Theft Auto 4, Super Mario World, Zelda Ocarina of Time at No.
9125365	9126986	5, all the way down to OutRun 2 at No.
9127006	9126986	50.
9127126	9130707	It's like, seriously, Guinness, no one gives a shit about your book anymore.
9130727	9132168	Hey, I love Guinness when it's booze.
9132308	9136570	Actually, yes, I give a shit about their book anymore, so sorry, you're wrong.
9136770	9137791	But even about video games?
9138631	9139251	Yes, actually.
9140532	9144414	I think that it's fantastic that they're still keeping track of all of this.
9144434	9144974	I think it's great.
9145731	9150254	Well, I beg to differ if they're still using Twin Galaxies to do it, but we'll save that for another night.
9150274	9155878	Not for using Twin Galaxies, but I mean, but I still think that the Guinness book is fantastic.
9156579	9157880	Alright, we got another call waiting on the line.
9157940	9158981	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9159001	9159341	Who's this?
9160662	9162203	Hi, yeah, this is Spazinator.
9162343	9163044	Hi, Spazinator.
9163064	9163584	What's on your mind?
9164985	9165806	Um, two things.
9166306	9172310	Um, I just want to say thank you to Loki for showing off Noby Noby Boy last week.
9173011	9173111	Um,
9173720	9180187	Thanks to him showing the footage of that, I ended up buying the game during the middle of the week.
9180688	9183671	It's actually quite fun, so thank you to him.
9184324	9188686	Yeah, I've heard kind of some mixed reviews on that, so I'm glad to hear you liked it after all.
9188806	9189887	No problem, we tried to do that.
9189907	9205535	Now that we've got the Justin.TV thing hooked up pretty cool, where even though I think watching a radio show being taped is the most boring thing in the world, at least the audio now goes out over Justin.TV really well, and we do those little breaks in between that seem to work out really well for the audience over there.
9205555	9210097	And it opens up our show to a new group of people, because there's a whole vast...
9211778	9217422	And as far as the second thing, I just wanted to respond to that one email that you read earlier today.
9217642	9225887	I can't remember his name, but he was asking about advice regarding Final Fantasy XI.
9225907	9226047	Yeah.
9239761	9246383	Yeah, basically, I agree with a lot of your criticisms of Final Fantasy XI.
9246583	9252265	I know the game is not perfect by a long shot, but still, it is pretty fun.
9253705	9256426	I've been playing it for just barely over three years now.
9257646	9266729	I would recommend that this person get into a good link shell, which is the game's equivalent to a build.
9267706	9272909	Um, and there's, uh, you know, the game is designed to be very social.
9273929	9282514	Um, so even if you're just sitting around waiting to get into a party, you know, you can always shoot the breeze with your friends in the windshield.
9283859	9284640	while you're waiting.
9314319	9318240	The number one thing that draws you to Final Fantasy XI besides the people.
9318421	9321842	What is it about Final Fantasy XI, the game, that keeps you coming back?
9323462	9332245	Well, you know, I've been a pretty big fan of the series as a whole for a number of years.
9332505	9337846	And I figured, you know, at the time, you know, this was the next one in the series.
9337946	9339627	Now, get that started now.
9340413	9349319	Not only that, but since I'm primarily a console gamer, my selection of MMOs are kind of limited.
9350840	9358406	The only one that I'm familiar with and heard of is the PlayStation 2 version of EverQuest.
9359226	9366151	And that was alright, but Final Fantasy XI, in my opinion, is a whole lot better.
9367172	9367272	Um...
9368437	9398048	and plus, you know, you can play as a black mage, you know, which both of my characters are and it's just so much fun nuking the shit out, you know, the beastmen in Final Fantasy XI, you know, whether you're casting fire or arrow or thunder or whatever, you know, just like doing, you know, castling, casting spells every two or three seconds, you know,
9399474	9405195	Alright, well, you know, I can see that because Final Fantasy XI was kind of a console game.
9405215	9406576	You know, it was made for the PlayStation 2.
9407176	9411357	I know a lot of people here in America played on the PC, but most people over in Japan played on PlayStation 2.
9411897	9414017	And a lot of people here in America played on PlayStation 2 as well.
9414357	9417438	It is one of the few MMOs very accessible through a console.
9417478	9418658	So, you know, I can kind of see that.
9418718	9423639	WoW is missing a significant user base from not having a version of it on consoles.
9423719	9426140	But then again, I couldn't see WoW on a console, so I get it.
9426520	9430661	Well, Spazinator, we're going to have to let you go so we can get some more calls, but I hope your sales pitch works.
9430681	9431221	I'm sure it will.
9431261	9437003	I'm sure Acidic Vampire will at least spend his one month in Final Fantasy XI, and hopefully he'll stay a little longer after that.
9437423	9440644	So, Spazinator, thank you so much for calling, and have a good one, okay?
9441725	9442325	Yep, you too.
9442365	9442765	Take care.
9443265	9443525	Alright.
9444786	9445486	Alright, take care, buddy.
9448087	9453488	Alright, 1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9454128	9455349	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9455369	9455729	Who's this?
9457097	9457497	and DSMaster25.
9458358	9459858	Well, hello, DSMaster.
9459938	9460319	What's up?
9461919	9462580	Not much.
9463380	9466362	I got a few new games and a few new features on.
9467182	9467702	Okay.
9468303	9471244	I don't know if something's weird with the audio we're getting.
9471284	9472565	It's a little hard to understand.
9472785	9474606	May I want to get a little bit away from your mic?
9474626	9475346	I don't know what's up with that.
9475386	9476426	No, that's all right.
9476506	9477947	So you have some new games you want to review.
9477987	9478327	What's up?
9478387	9478768	What games?
9480188	9484130	GTA, Liberty City and Tony Stark's Project 8.
9484891	9485731	Well, tell us about them.
9487014	9490897	Well, whatever you say, it's actually my first time playing it, even though I'm only 16.
9491037	9494559	I got ahold of it on Amazon, my debit card.
9496220	9500903	Basically, what I like is if we play it, it's just all humans, but a lot more.
9502424	9504786	I like rolling around in the paint and blowing stuff up.
9507588	9509069	Blowing stuff up in games is always fun.
9510816	9513157	So what was the other game you played besides Grand Theft Auto?
9513177	9515117	Tony Hawk's Project 8 Tell us a little more about this game.
9516638	9518919	This one's not ringing a bell for some reason.
9519399	9519719	Basically...
9540407	9543731	It's like all your Tony Rock games, but a little bit more of a challenge.
9545273	9549539	Basically, you had to keep pushing up to keep your skater going.
9549559	9552562	There is no auto-kick option whatsoever in the game.
9556127	9556908	What game is this?
9558359	9560919	Tony Hawk's Project D. It's a little bit more challenging, I will say.
9560939	9563460	It's going to be more of a challenge for me to buy it used than I buy most games used.
9588416	9591459	What makes this game different from the other Tony Hawk games?
9593380	9599365	Like, basically, more area to explore.
9599686	9605731	It's like a free realm game, kind of like American Wasteland, which the PSP never got.
9607812	9612697	Because the DS got American Wasteland, but the DS never got Project 8.
9613377	9616039	And actually, there is another game I got...
9617225	9627029	Rock Revolution for DS That must be interesting, Rock Revolution on the DS.
9627069	9628749	I know we had a review on that a couple weeks ago.
9628789	9629750	I think Sauce reviewed it.
9630290	9634231	I'm still tempted to get it for $20 on 360, but then I'm like, oh, that's $20.
9634391	9635312	I could, like, buy lunch.
9637052	9642635	Actually, the DS version has the singing in it, which the consoles are missing.
9643335	9644295	That is so weird.
9644375	9646296	But, of course, the DS has the built-in microphone.
9648393	9651115	Yeah, even though, here's my little problem here.
9651535	9658079	With Blackbeard and the PSP, I mean, why didn't Hermione just go with what, um, Activision did?
9658899	9664463	And basically redo the guitar grip but to fit the USB port in the clamp-on?
9664483	9667024	Because that would have made sense.
9668085	9668845	For a guitar grip.
9669846	9671147	Mm.
9671167	9672007	Could be.
9673848	9674229	All right.
9674489	9674829	Or something.
9675560	9681782	Well, we are going to go ahead and wrap up and let you go, but keep having fun with the DS games.
9682802	9684683	So, you know, have fun.
9685183	9685423	All right.
9686083	9693006	I love the PS3, and it's actually awesome, but I just got a new screen, so I just need to fix the buttons now.
9693866	9694246	All right.
9694286	9694646	Yay.
9695266	9696007	All right, take care, buddy.
9696147	9696287	Bye.
9696307	9697627	All right, take care, buddy.
9697667	9698247	Peace out.
9698267	9698587	See ya.
9699728	9700028	All right.
9701659	9705123	Okay, that was DS Master calling in.
9706704	9709146	And that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9709186	9710748	Thank you guys so much for the calls.
9710948	9712330	And sorry to those that didn't get through.
9712390	9716514	Apparently it's been popular the past couple weeks, but we will open it up again next week as we always do.
9716554	9720698	Don't forget you can always send in an email or post something on the forums, etc., etc.
9722919	9725440	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9726100	9727240	And then we're going to close up shop.
9727300	9728641	Oh, last minute stories though first.
9728861	9730381	Was there anything else?
9730621	9732021	I had the one Guinness thing.
9732862	9733162	Loki.
9733882	9736122	Yeah, there's a few things real quick.
9736702	9746865	There was the announcement this week, or they finally made it official, that the red Xbox 360 Elite system with Resident Evil 5...
9747765	9748846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9775387	9781016	All that for the low, low price of $399.99 or just the normal price of an Elite system.
9782839	9785343	Pretty good deal if you were looking to buy an Elite system.
9789148	9798715	And the other thing that's supposed to be worked on right now is apparently it is expected to sign a deal for Doom 4 later this year.
9799235	9801697	However, they don't know who the publisher is going to be yet.
9801937	9804639	But you better believe that you're going to see a Doom 4.
9805259	9806800	I wouldn't be surprised if it was EA.
9807041	9810703	But, you know, I don't know.
9811023	9811884	Doom 3 is kind of eh.
9812524	9812985	It's all right.
9814766	9815847	And then that's it.
9817168	9817628	All right.
9819232	9822873	Well, I guess that's going to do it for tonight's show.
9823073	9825975	Let's go around and get everybody's last final thoughts.
9826475	9832397	My final thought would be I should really play this copy of Every Extend Extra I have sitting here in front of me.
9833377	9834958	Find my PSP because this is a great game.
9835278	9838839	I love it on the Xbox Live Arcade, but I didn't play it enough on PSP.
9838859	9839820	I think I'm going to do that this week.
9840520	9841460	DarkSakura, final thought.
9841661	9842821	I want my headache to go away.
9843301	9843761	I'm sorry.
9847183	9848003	Loki, your final thought.
9848516	9849036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9875425	9876145	Thank you for watching!
9903954	9905895	Coming up on our 7th anniversary if you can believe it.
9906336	9906916	That's going to do it.
9907056	9907937	Have a great night everybody.
9907977	9910499	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9927250	9929753	or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
