7000	13000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco Kade
14000	19000	Tonight, March 1, 2009, the R4DS card gets smacked down in Japan
19000	22000	Cooking Mama is ready to fix it on your iPhone
22000	25000	Could a remake of Silent Hill be made for the Wii?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	42000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
42000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
48000	50000	I have beef
50000	56000	Congratulations, hopefully you don't get equal eye or any of the mad cow disease or anything like that
56000	58000	No!
58000	60000	You do sound like an angry cow right there
60000	62000	How are you?
62000	63000	Beefy
63000	65000	Alright, say hello
65000	68000	Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki
68000	69000	Hello
69000	71000	Are you feeling beefy as well?
71000	72000	No
72000	73000	How are you feeling?
73000	74000	Cheesy
74000	75000	Cheesy, alright
75000	76000	I am feeling hungry
76000	78000	Sir Robert, are you the buns?
78000	80000	I guess so
82000	86000	You're listening to Cheeseburger Radio where you can have all the time
86000	89000	I have a cheese pizza because I haven't eaten anything all day long
89000	90000	All day long?
90000	96000	Yeah because I was busy, I woke up early because Nathan had to call me early to go to Fry's
96000	100000	And we were building a computer all day and I didn't have a chance to stop and eat something
100000	103000	So you didn't, you got rained out for your thing once again didn't you?
103000	106000	And next week and the week after next
106000	109000	Yeah, don't get me started on that
109000	114000	It's funny because it'll be clear all fucking week long and then Sunday
114000	116000	POUR!
116000	121000	You look at the weather next week, it's the same way except it's pouring all week
121000	124000	And then it has a break and then pouring some more on Sunday
124000	128000	At least it's not snowing here, on my Twitter today like all my friends on the east coast are like
128000	130000	OMG snow, OMG snow
130000	131000	It's snowing in Alabama
131000	133000	It's snowing like all over the southeast, what?
133000	137000	I have to tell you something else that's really cool, I had cheeseburgers for breakfast too
137000	140000	You had cheeseburgers today for breakfast?
140000	144000	Yes, my leftovers from Denny's last night because we stopped in Denny's on the way home
144000	149000	I want to say hello to of course our chatters, the always present fourth guests on the show
149000	152000	Over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
152000	157000	And we actually have a chatter named Cheeseburger who is very excited saying
157000	159000	Yay Cheeseburger Radio
159000	165000	We also like to broadcast the show on Justin TV which you can see as we're taping live on Sunday nights as well
165000	167000	Justin.tv.orangeloungeradio
167000	170000	Although people are supposed to be clipping parts of the show, making clips for us
170000	171000	Do it!
171000	173000	So I can put them on YouTube but there's like one clip
173000	177000	But I want to show this on Justin TV so I apologize it's going to be a horrible radio
177000	181000	But Darkshark talk about the donations you've made to the studio
181000	182000	Well first of all a little bit of background
182000	187000	Dan and I are doing Uber cleaning, this is like spring cleaning for the millennium
187000	192000	And we found a bunch of our old posters and wall scrolls and some of them are kind of smashed
192000	195000	But I don't think Rob cares about smashed posters on the wall
195000	202000	So I decided to donate a number of our posters that we were just going to get rid of
202000	204000	It's hard to see on the TV anyway
204000	209000	To the wall, not only that wall but the other wall and probably that wall too
209000	212000	And the ceiling maybe
212000	215000	Who knows we might be able to really decorate in here I'm sure our landlords will love that
215000	218000	But I wanted to show this one in particular because this is one of the coolest donations I think
218000	221000	And a lot of our long time fans are going to get a kick out of this
221000	223000	But tell them what I'm opening up right now
223000	227000	Rob is opening up a DDR second mix marquee
227000	230000	Which I have had for quite some time
230000	233000	And that's like an actual like used in a machine type thing
233000	236000	And if you put tacks in that thing I will shoot you
236000	238000	Alright then I can't put tacks in it
238000	239000	You can use sticky tacks
239000	243000	I'll figure something out but look at that there's even an official Konami seal there in the corner
243000	244000	That shows you it's the real deal
244000	247000	It means nothing
247000	248000	That one is though
248000	250000	I don't think they really pirated second mix though
250000	253000	No that one actually is a legit second mix marquee
253000	260000	So it's my baby it was going to go in the vault but now the vault is completely empty
260000	265000	I have the metal thing from the machine I don't remember the face plate or whatever
265000	267000	I never did use that for anything
267000	268000	But it's around somewhere
268000	270000	Bring it on over we'll put it in studio
270000	274000	But what would the listeners be most excited about that you're planning to do with some of your stuff
274000	275000	Dark Sakura?
275000	280000	Well I don't know yet it's not really official Rob
280000	282000	Oh sorry then I won't say anything else
282000	283000	Well I'll say something
283000	285000	Burn it on air
285000	288000	Yes we're going to burn some of it live on air
288000	293000	Well as I'm sure our listeners know Dan and I have a whole lot of shit
293000	296000	A lot of stuff really
296000	300000	And because we're going to be thinning out the collection some of it
300000	305000	I'm thinking that some of the neater things that we just won't be able to eBay or anything
305000	309000	I might make a big grab bag for who wants my shit
309000	316000	So if anyone is interested in that then quick quick vote in the chat room
316000	318000	Wire in or fire
318000	321000	Who wants my shit?
321000	323000	I hope fire wins
323000	329000	And like I'm talking like leftover stuff like Hello Kitty stationary from six years ago
329000	331000	Awesome
331000	334000	And Rudoni Kenshin stationary from eight years ago
334000	336000	Who wants Jamie's crap?
336000	340000	And like leftover wall scrolls and shit
340000	344000	I see a lot of Y's popping up in chat people want your shit
344000	345000	God you want my crap
345000	346000	Act deft I want your shit
346000	351000	Like old E3 swag you know just crap
351000	354000	The DJ Ronma S wants to know where's the whiteboard
354000	358000	The whiteboard is here it's down for repairs before we remodel the studio
358000	361000	I used it for a side project on Thursday and I need to clean it up
361000	362000	Rob used it for Big Brother
362000	364000	I did I used it for the Big Brother game
364000	366000	I was just guessing that's great
366000	370000	I actually did on my own personal JTV I don't know if I want to give out the link
370000	373000	I'll put it out in chat or something but on my own personal JTV channel
373000	375000	You can see the whiteboard being used earlier this week
375000	376000	There you go
376000	378000	For my online reality game addiction
378000	381000	Alright let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week
381000	383000	Actually we're going to start a little different tonight with How Was Your Gaming Week
383000	385000	We're going to do something a little different
385000	387000	I'm going to start because I can
387000	390000	But I want to talk about something that actually was both Dark Soccer and myself
390000	392000	We went to Video Games Live last night
392000	394000	Very unexpected
394000	397000	Kind of came up last minute that a friend of mine had some extra tickets
397000	400000	But boy did he have some good extra tickets
400000	402000	We got the front row
402000	404000	Well I didn't Dark Soccer did
404000	406000	And some of us were
406000	407000	I mean the venue was really nice
407000	409000	We went to the Fox Theater in Oakland
409000	411000	It was a pretty venue
411000	413000	I was taking pictures of the freaking architecture
413000	415000	Is it a new venue? I've never seen anything there before
415000	417000	They're remodeling it
417000	418000	Oh okay that makes sense
418000	420000	It's fairly old it's the Fox Theater in Oakland
420000	422000	On telegraph
422000	423000	Gotcha
423000	425000	Well um yeah
425000	427000	We went to Video Games Live
427000	429000	And you know we had Tommy on the show
429000	431000	Probably about what nine months ago Tommy Tallarico
431000	433000	The guy that you know is really the mastermind behind it
433000	435000	Long enough to have a baby
435000	437000	He talked for a long time
437000	439000	When he was on the show
439000	441000	But no we really got some insight as to what was going on
441000	443000	So we finally got to check it out
443000	445000	Because the show's been going for what three four years
445000	447000	I never had a chance to check it out
447000	449000	And Bobby reminded me
449000	451000	Bobby Black Wolf is the show that's on before us on All Games Radio
451000	453000	When we tape live
453000	455000	Bobby reminded me that I had been hazing Pong
455000	457000	As one of the selections for
457000	459000	Inclusion
459000	461000	In Video Games Live
461000	463000	And actually it works
463000	465000	The whole classic game medley thing
465000	467000	Was actually one of my favorite pieces they did
467000	469000	Because it did time the music very well
469000	471000	I had Ross Dunn in it
471000	473000	I in turn will stay um
475000	477000	You need to see it though Loki
477000	479000	It's like for five seconds it's not even that bad
479000	481000	I say that the Pong idea is stupid
481000	483000	It was fantastic
483000	485000	I know on the record scene it's retarded
485000	487000	And not fantastic in any way
487000	489000	You're just an asshole
489000	491000	No actually it was
491000	493000	It was good though the whole classic game medley was actually one of my favorite pieces that they did
493000	495000	It was a good way to start the show
495000	497000	I want my medley of Vectrex
497000	499000	You know the buzzing from the screen
499000	501000	Well they did have
501000	503000	Some really random stuff in there
503000	505000	Like they had this
505000	507000	Well I'm talking about some of the pieces
507000	509000	They did the interactive space invaders thing last night
509000	511000	That looked fun
511000	513000	They had a guy get up on stage and he would run to the left
513000	515000	And the ship would move left
515000	517000	And run to the right and the ship would move right
517000	519000	But you can tell it's just some dude in the back with a joystick
519000	521000	Moving it in the direction that the guy is running
521000	523000	Because there's huge massive lag
523000	525000	But no matter what he did the space invaders destroyed
525000	527000	The two world trade centers
527000	529000	Shut up
529000	531000	But he did
531000	533000	He didn't win because
533000	535000	Tommy was yelling shoot the sides you idiot
535000	537000	Not like that but he's yelling shoot the sides
537000	539000	And the guy didn't figure out how to do it
539000	541000	But I was thinking to myself
541000	543000	There's really not a lot of music in space invaders
543000	545000	It's literally three notes
545000	547000	That the orchestra is playing
547000	549000	Sorry four notes
549000	551000	That the orchestra is playing faster and faster
551000	553000	With one person assigned to be the UFO
553000	557000	Whatever the UFO would show up on screen
557000	559000	I think the chorus was singing with it though
559000	561000	Were they really?
561000	563000	I thought it was kind of cheesy
563000	565000	But it was cool
565000	567000	Video games live is a very
567000	569000	Unformal thing
569000	571000	I was comparing it to the Dear Friends concert
571000	573000	That Square puts on that I've also been to
573000	575000	Twice actually
575000	577000	The Dear Friends thing
577000	579000	That whole thing is more like
579000	581000	A night at the orchestra
581000	583000	Granted there's a little more clapping and cheering
583000	585000	And interactivity
585000	587000	But like in video games live
587000	589000	Tommy just comes right out and says
589000	591000	You just scream right along
591000	593000	You cheer for your favorite stuff
593000	595000	We just want everybody to have fun
595000	597000	So you can tell right off the bat
597000	599000	They're going for a totally different type of setup
599000	601000	Did anyone go whoa intermission
601000	603000	My favorite part
603000	605000	Was there? There was applause for the intermission
605000	607000	Because they had like a loading screen which was really funny
607000	609000	I know it was cool It was funny
609000	611000	I liked that they had before the show
611000	613000	And during the intermission they would have little
613000	615000	YouTubes like that Miss Pacman
615000	617000	For reals thing and some of these things would
617000	619000	Show up randomly during the
619000	621000	Usually dead parts and it was cool
621000	623000	Okay so I had a good time
623000	625000	It was like a mini convention and obviously a lot
625000	627000	Of the arrangements were beautiful
627000	629000	I forgot just how awesome the music is
629000	631000	In Civ 4 I'm so happy they included that
631000	633000	Piece because Civilization 4 was amazing
633000	635000	The singer was very nervous
635000	637000	The singer was very nervous
637000	639000	But he did a good job
639000	641000	He's got a gorgeous voice
641000	643000	Oh yeah the god of war
643000	645000	Not a series I've ever really been into
645000	647000	Her voice was impressive Amazing
647000	649000	Her voice was amazing
649000	651000	Metroid makes me want to play that game now
651000	653000	The Metroid thing gave me a huge fan boner
653000	655000	Obviously if you've listened to the show long enough
655000	657000	The minute Super Metroid
657000	659000	This is just the ending to Sonic 1
659000	661000	I'm going Sonic Avenger
661000	663000	They're just putting it up there to show the other games
663000	665000	Hush
665000	667000	They were just showing you the Mario thing
667000	669000	They showed like every Mario game in existence
669000	671000	You know what my favorite was Rob? What?
671000	673000	The Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross debut
673000	675000	Brand new World premiere we saw last night
675000	677000	Of the oft requested
677000	679000	Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross
679000	681000	Which to me was like Scars of Time
681000	683000	Plus a couple other things
683000	685000	Scars of Time is one of my favorite video game songs
685000	687000	Period so I was just fine with that
687000	689000	That was like the World of Warcraft heckling
689000	691000	There was a piece that was called
691000	693000	Ten Years of Warcraft
693000	695000	And the first guy
695000	697000	Gets up and goes FOR THE HORDE
697000	699000	And there's people ahhh
699000	701000	And then FOR THE ALLIANCE
701000	703000	Boo
703000	705000	Our area was booing, it was amazing
705000	707000	Ok, parts I didn't like
707000	709000	And Jamie disagrees with me on this
709000	711000	Here's the thing, when I say I didn't like it
711000	713000	This is like constructive criticism
713000	715000	Overall I thought the show was great
715000	717000	But if there's one thing I could've replaced
717000	719000	With something else, because he goes up there and he says
719000	721000	Hey we have like 60 things
721000	723000	We could choose from and it's really hard to pick 20
723000	725000	That we can do here tonight, so my suggestion
725000	727000	Lose the Guitar Hero Aerosmith
727000	729000	Thing because it didn't fit
729000	731000	To me, it did not fit with the rest of the night
731000	733000	And yes I understand Guitar Hero is a video game too
733000	735000	Blah blah blah, and yes we understand
735000	737000	Tommy Tallarico is related to
737000	739000	But, but
739000	741000	Here's the thing, I didn't go to
741000	743000	Video Games Live to hear Sweet Emotion
743000	745000	You know what I mean? Dude I sure did
745000	747000	It just was not
747000	749000	What I wanted to hear, it felt like
749000	751000	I could watch a dude play Guitar Hero any day of the week
751000	753000	On YouTube or any of that stuff
753000	755000	I just didn't, I didn't care for that
755000	757000	And then when I go online and see
757000	759000	Oh I could've heard Bioshock and instead
759000	761000	They gave me that, you know I just, I was a little disappointed
761000	763000	I understand they want to give more stuff away
763000	765000	Do another interactive cheer cheer cheer thing
765000	767000	But for me it didn't work, I didn't like it
767000	769000	I think the best thing to have done
769000	771000	With that would be to have brought the guy out
771000	773000	And said here, here's your prize
773000	775000	This is the dude that won, yay
775000	777000	Bye, and maybe
777000	779000	I would even go for like a
779000	781000	Music game tribute that does
781000	783000	Like Guitar Hero and Rock Band little pieces
783000	785000	Of the songs or something
785000	787000	You know maybe even incorporate some DDR
787000	789000	I don't know, they're gonna be cool, Space Channel 5
789000	791000	I, I
791000	793000	Okay, when they said that they were about to do
793000	795000	A tribute to the Sega game, was I the only one
795000	797000	That yelled out Space Channel 5?
797000	799000	We all knew it would be Sonic
799000	801000	Cause I, of course
801000	803000	We all knew it would be Sonic, but wouldn't it be amazing
803000	805000	If it was choo choo
805000	807000	It was Yuji Naka up there, and I love that I got to see
807000	809000	My musical hero twice
809000	811000	Koji Kondo
811000	813000	Oh yeah, he was up there on the big screen
813000	815000	Yuji Naka was like, okay I suck at English
815000	817000	So I'm just gonna say it in Japanese
817000	819000	And I'm like, I don't have to use the subtitles
819000	821000	But um, it was
821000	823000	I'll tell you what though, um
823000	825000	What I did, I had a fun time
825000	827000	With this part, was when he came out with
827000	829000	The guitar before the Chrono Trigger
829000	831000	Bit, and like
831000	833000	So what do you, so, you know, we're gonna hear
833000	835000	All of this, it's like, play some Skynyrd, man
835000	837000	And I was like, Freebird
837000	839000	Yeah, the minute he came out with his guitar, everybody started yelling
839000	841000	Freebird, he's like, I'm not gonna play
841000	843000	Freebird, and then after
843000	845000	The song was over, he says, okay, now I'm gonna play Freebird
845000	847000	So
847000	849000	Actually, there was, there was somebody in our
849000	851000	Section that called for Sweet
851000	853000	Emotion, that called for
853000	855000	Dream On, that was it
855000	857000	Really, see, somebody else knew, I guess
857000	859000	Black Wilson Chat right now and says, I've got the Video Games Live Chrono Trigger
859000	861000	Song up on YouTube, this is a good arrangement
861000	863000	Has it really hit YouTube already?
863000	865000	Dude, he said, get that on YouTube
865000	867000	Tonight
867000	869000	That's true
869000	871000	Now that's what I thought was great
871000	873000	Cameras were encouraged
873000	875000	Video taping was encouraged
875000	877000	It was fun
877000	879000	There's no stick up the ass, cause keep in mind
879000	881000	Every concert
881000	883000	Okay, here we go, we got a little bit
883000	885000	Yeah, this is from last night, this is from user
885000	887000	GBPMike has put up
887000	889000	Some of the arrangement
889000	891000	Yeah, this is from last night
897000	899000	And you can hear everybody cheering and yelling in the back
903000	905000	Let me skip ahead to some of the Scarra time piece
905000	907000	I felt really bad for the flute player
907000	909000	Yeah, the flute player botched a little bit
909000	911000	Missed a note, big time
918000	920000	Yeah, Scarra time is just a beautiful song
920000	922000	And to hear that done live was cool
925000	927000	So anyway, yeah, the flute player missed a note
927000	929000	I think even Martin Learned missed a note at one point
929000	931000	I heard the piano, I don't know if it was him on piano
931000	933000	I heard a bad piano note at one point
933000	935000	I was like, don't!
935000	937000	But you know, mistakes happen, I'm not gonna be that critical
937000	939000	That's just, that's, you know
939000	941000	It didn't ruin the night, come on
941000	943000	No it didn't
943000	945000	I am, it ruined the night completely
945000	947000	How dare they miss a note
947000	949000	I come for a perfect performance
949000	951000	It's a little different when you're the soloist
951000	953000	Yeah, it's tough, that's a lot of pressure
953000	955000	I doubt they have a lot of time to practice either
955000	957000	But you know, I've been there before
957000	959000	So I can't really say anything
959000	961000	The only other thing
961000	963000	It is an expensive asking price
963000	965000	The seats we had were 60 bucks
965000	967000	I imagine the seats up in the nosebleeds were a lot cheaper
967000	971000	That's a hard price to call in this economy
971000	973000	But you know, that is the price of a video game
973000	975000	You know, considering no doubt
975000	977000	Tickets are going for like 80 bucks right now
977000	979000	It's I guess what concert tickets are going for these days
979000	981000	But you know what, if you have the money
981000	983000	If you have the time
983000	985000	Check it out when it goes to your town
985000	987000	I wouldn't follow it around like a dead tour or anything like that
987000	989000	Or I don't think I'd drive like a huge distance to see it
989000	991000	But I would definitely make it a point to see it
991000	993000	When it comes to my town again
993000	995000	I might actually, you know
995000	997000	I want to see different shows
997000	999000	They just announced, if you go to their site
999000	1001000	They just announced like 45 new tour dates
1001000	1003000	Or something like that
1003000	1005000	They are going to be playing a show
1005000	1007000	In LA on June 4th
1007000	1009000	During E3
1009000	1011000	So they love to do that
1011000	1013000	They love to kind of sync up with big nerd conventions
1013000	1015000	And things of that sort
1015000	1017000	WonderCon was this one
1017000	1019000	Yes
1019000	1021000	Act F asked did they play the Metal Gear Solid song
1021000	1023000	Yes they did
1023000	1025000	David Hayter doing intros
1025000	1027000	For each part
1027000	1029000	And Tommy Tallarico came out in the orange box
1029000	1031000	And he was hiding in the box that said orange on it
1031000	1033000	Lots of tour dates announced for Canada
1033000	1035000	If you're in Canada you're very happy right now
1035000	1037000	They're going to Saskatchewan
1037000	1039000	On May 11th, Alberta
1039000	1041000	Calgary 15th, 16th
1041000	1043000	Edmonton 18th
1043000	1045000	British Columbia, the 20th and 21st
1045000	1047000	All those dates in May
1047000	1049000	So they're doing a huge sweep of Canada in May
1049000	1051000	Like even Winnipeg in July as well
1051000	1053000	Singapore, they're going to be in Singapore
1053000	1055000	Romania
1055000	1057000	France in November later on this year
1057000	1059000	They'll be in Portland, Oregon for a couple of shows
1059000	1061000	In November
1061000	1063000	San Diego July 23rd
1063000	1065000	New York, Lewiston
1065000	1067000	July 31st, so they're going to be all over
1067000	1069000	Later this year
1069000	1071000	Alright
1071000	1073000	So that was our experience of Video Games Live
1073000	1075000	Otherwise as far as my gaming week goes personally
1075000	1077000	I didn't have a whole lot else to do with my week
1077000	1079000	That was new
1079000	1081000	Didn't play a lot of new stuff
1081000	1083000	Still the old standby favorites
1083000	1085000	But I'm definitely this week going back to playing some Civ 4
1085000	1087000	After remembering how awesome the music is this week
1087000	1089000	I was like, oh god I need to play this again
1089000	1091000	Especially with the video and everything
1091000	1093000	It makes you all warm and tingly
1093000	1095000	Like a video game fan
1095000	1097000	So Dark Sakura, anything else in your gaming week
1097000	1099000	Besides Video Game Live?
1099000	1101000	I actually, right before the show
1101000	1103000	When I was getting my slab of beef
1103000	1105000	With two crackers on either side
1105000	1109000	I was playing Raiden 2
1109000	1111000	And Marvel vs Capcom
1111000	1113000	And oh my god
1113000	1117000	I hate when an arcade machine is in such bad repair
1117000	1119000	Oh god
1119000	1121000	I was using the dragon though in Raiden 2
1121000	1123000	That was pretty fun
1123000	1125000	I was just going to say
1125000	1127000	Speaking of arcade machines
1127000	1129000	This is going to seem completely random
1129000	1131000	But I saw a news story on this this week
1131000	1133000	Did you hear about that they're auctioning off all the arcade games
1133000	1135000	That they had at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch
1135000	1137000	They're going to try to sell all these games
1137000	1139000	The dude had a hip hop mania
1139000	1141000	Or the machine
1141000	1143000	He had a Sega 360
1143000	1145000	He had one of those two, he had a lot of different types of machines
1145000	1147000	But he actually had a hip hop mania cabinet
1147000	1149000	I kind of want it
1149000	1151000	Like the starting price I think was only like 400 to 600 dollars
1151000	1153000	I'm thinking about putting a bid on it
1153000	1155000	Just for fun
1155000	1157000	Dude, wouldn't it be awesome to have a freaking hip hop mania cabinet in here
1157000	1159000	That was like once owned by Michael Jackson
1159000	1161000	That would be kind of funny
1161000	1163000	Dude, that is not auctioning off his moon walker
1163000	1165000	I don't know why
1165000	1167000	But I think that's one of those random awesome things
1167000	1169000	Dude, he had a jumbo safari machine
1169000	1171000	Well keep in mind
1171000	1173000	Who is his biggest
1173000	1175000	Video game buddy
1175000	1177000	Oh Sega
1177000	1179000	Absolutely
1179000	1181000	He was in Space Channel 5 part 2
1181000	1183000	Shut up Loki
1183000	1185000	I said video game buddy
1185000	1187000	What? He played video games with him
1187000	1189000	Macaulay Culkin is not a video game company
1189000	1191000	We said buddy
1191000	1193000	You did not specify
1193000	1195000	Tigerclaw says I wonder did Michael Jackson even play those games
1195000	1197000	Probably not
1197000	1199000	Well maybe a couple of them
1199000	1201000	But who knows
1201000	1203000	I doubt he played them all
1203000	1205000	But it would still be kind of cool to own a machine that was once at Neverland Ranch
1205000	1207000	Come on, come on
1207000	1209000	Who doesn't want to own a piece of history like that
1209000	1211000	I think I'm seriously going to try to buy one of the machines
1211000	1213000	I can't spend a lot of money
1213000	1215000	But you know, I'll try to get something, why not
1215000	1217000	Alright
1217000	1219000	Because if you win that arcade machine you better check it with a black light
1219000	1221000	They had a hip hop mania machine local
1221000	1223000	Did they
1223000	1225000	It was a beat mania machine or something
1225000	1227000	I sent Jamie the link to it
1227000	1229000	On Twitter like a while ago
1229000	1231000	That poor
1231000	1233000	And it was about the same price
1233000	1235000	Interesting
1235000	1237000	Not from Golfland though
1237000	1239000	Not for sure, Roseville
1239000	1241000	Hip hop mania, it's got to be from Golfland
1241000	1243000	I swear to god though
1243000	1245000	If other Bamani fans out there try to outbid me on the hip hop mania machine
1245000	1247000	From Neverland Ranch
1247000	1249000	I will cut you
1249000	1251000	Jamie anything else
1251000	1253000	I can't say names right tonight
1253000	1255000	Anything else in your gaming week
1255000	1257000	Um
1257000	1259000	No
1259000	1261000	City of Heroes
1261000	1263000	My thing expired now
1263000	1265000	So I don't know if I'm going to play
1265000	1267000	And
1267000	1269000	Really stupid flash game
1269000	1271000	That I can't remember
1271000	1273000	Oh yeah, I played with my virtual pet on
1273000	1275000	Facebook today
1275000	1277000	I also want to say that was the worst no answer I've ever heard
1277000	1279000	What
1279000	1281000	Cause you said, I said is there anything else in your gaming week
1281000	1283000	You said no, but City of Heroes
1283000	1285000	And Facebook games
1285000	1287000	Oh
1287000	1289000	Rob
1289000	1291000	What
1291000	1293000	Loki how was your gaming week
1293000	1295000	Oh I didn't play anything
1295000	1297000	Except for, you know, Grand Theft Auto
1297000	1299000	Lost and Damned
1299000	1301000	You're a little feisty tonight Loki
1301000	1303000	I like this
1303000	1305000	No I'm getting over a cold actually
1305000	1307000	Again, it's like cold the sequel
1307000	1309000	You know I first got sick and then I got better
1309000	1311000	And then I got the flu
1311000	1313000	And then I got better
1313000	1315000	But now I'm coughing again
1315000	1317000	No so I was actually out sick
1317000	1319000	A couple days this week
1319000	1321000	Unfortunately I forgot to bring my 360 home with me
1321000	1323000	So I didn't play anything during that time
1323000	1325000	Um
1325000	1327000	But I did play Lost and Damned
1327000	1329000	Mostly this week
1329000	1331000	Really fun keeping me interested for a while
1331000	1333000	Until I finish the story mode
1333000	1335000	I also got to check out
1335000	1337000	A little bit of Eat Lead
1337000	1339000	The Return of Matt Hazard
1339000	1341000	And it's kind of cheesy
1341000	1343000	But I kind of like it
1343000	1345000	It's got achievements like crazy
1345000	1347000	For the most redundant stupid things ever
1347000	1349000	Like you start the game
1349000	1351000	And you get an achievement immediately
1351000	1353000	It's awesome
1353000	1355000	You pause the game and you get an achievement
1355000	1357000	Um
1357000	1359000	It's great
1359000	1361000	But then
1361000	1363000	The whole game is just very
1363000	1365000	Making fun of itself
1365000	1367000	And it's fun in that sense
1367000	1369000	I mean the game itself is not that great
1369000	1371000	They do have some really cool stuff that they did with the cover system
1371000	1373000	Like you can actually
1373000	1375000	Look ahead and find a piece of cover
1375000	1377000	And you hit a button and you'll actually
1377000	1379000	Sprint to that location which is pretty cool
1379000	1381000	And apparently the main character
1381000	1383000	Likes that cover system too
1383000	1385000	As he comments on it as you're playing the game
1385000	1387000	And he also complains about having to go through
1387000	1389000	A tutorial which is funny
1389000	1391000	Um
1391000	1393000	But yeah I haven't really gotten past the first stage yet
1393000	1395000	Because I literally started playing it about 20 minutes
1395000	1397000	Before I came over here
1397000	1399000	Um
1399000	1401000	But it's fun
1401000	1403000	And you can actually find it in stores now
1403000	1405000	Or at least some stores
1405000	1407000	Because Gamestop apparently
1407000	1409000	Broke street on it everywhere
1409000	1411000	Because they had it listed in their system
1411000	1413000	For the 26th of February
1413000	1415000	March 3rd
1415000	1417000	They just said ah fuck it we're not changing it in our system
1417000	1419000	And so they just left it out
1419000	1421000	At what stores put it out
1421000	1423000	But it will be coming out everywhere March 3rd
1423000	1425000	So look for it then
1425000	1427000	But um
1427000	1429000	Yeah that's pretty much it
1429000	1431000	And no DJ Dark Knight I'm not talking about Killzone
1431000	1433000	Because I didn't buy Killzone
1433000	1435000	And to be honest I'm actually gonna hold off on it
1435000	1437000	Because I still haven't even played through Resistance 2 yet
1437000	1439000	So there's no way I'm gonna
1439000	1441000	Start another game
1441000	1443000	You know well I am starting to eat lead
1443000	1445000	So I guess
1445000	1447000	I can't really see much there but I'm not buying another game
1447000	1449000	You know for the PS3 right now
1449000	1451000	One game at a time right
1451000	1453000	Yeah I wanna get through Resistance
1453000	1455000	You know Killzone I'm not too interested in
1455000	1457000	I never played the first one
1457000	1459000	The Resistance I've actually played you know the
1459000	1461000	The first game and went through the entire story line
1461000	1463000	So I actually kinda know what's going on
1463000	1465000	And I kinda wanna play the Resistance 2 all the way through
1465000	1467000	And then maybe play Resistance
1467000	1469000	Retribution when that comes out
1469000	1471000	Um
1471000	1473000	I might be getting a new car soon
1473000	1475000	One of the things I did this weekend was I went car shopping
1475000	1477000	Yeah it kept me away from video games for a little while
1477000	1479000	And the reason why I bring that up is that if I do end up getting a car
1479000	1481000	And have to factor in a car payment into my budget now
1481000	1483000	I'm probably gonna have to really cut back on the amount of new video games
1483000	1485000	I buy so I
1485000	1487000	I can definitely feel the pain of you know I don't have to get
1487000	1489000	Killzone 2 just cause it's new
1489000	1491000	No and seriously that is the thing too
1491000	1493000	It's like I kinda almost feel like peer pressure
1493000	1495000	Based on you know all the advertisements
1495000	1497000	And all the hype and stuff
1497000	1499000	And I look at it and it's like
1499000	1501000	You know it's just another shooter game
1501000	1503000	Do I really need to play this and no I don't
1503000	1505000	It's the same with like Star Ocean
1505000	1507000	I was gonna buy that and I'm like do I need to really play this right now
1507000	1509000	No I don't
1509000	1511000	And it's the more I keep evaluating stuff like that
1511000	1513000	The less I'm buying
1513000	1515000	Which is fine
1515000	1517000	You know cause there's gonna be
1517000	1519000	Eat Lead was one of those games that looked funny
1519000	1521000	And I wanna play it and I didn't really give a crap about
1521000	1523000	You know the production value
1523000	1525000	Or anything of the game cause
1525000	1527000	You know it's not an excellent
1527000	1529000	Game but it's fun
1529000	1531000	So that's why I decided to play that one
1531000	1533000	And then of course you know
1533000	1535000	I'm waiting for Mad World to come out
1535000	1537000	Because it's a lot of blood and
1537000	1539000	Killing which is gonna be so awesome
1539000	1541000	Act deft in chat jokes
1541000	1543000	Sky you're getting a Yaris? I'm considering it
1543000	1545000	It's not high up on my list anymore though
1545000	1547000	It was before but right now I'm
1547000	1549000	I'm torn between another Corolla and a Jetta
1549000	1551000	Rob if you get a Yaris the terrorists win
1551000	1553000	Hahahaha
1553000	1555000	And by terrorists I mean
1555000	1557000	People that made the Yaris game
1557000	1559000	Oh shut up
1559000	1561000	Anything else Loki in your gaming week?
1561000	1563000	I was actually
1563000	1565000	Also looking at
1565000	1567000	Hacking lost and damned
1567000	1569000	But I haven't gotten around to actually
1569000	1571000	Doing it
1571000	1573000	Yet but I've
1573000	1575000	Been looking at how I'm going
1575000	1577000	To do it
1577000	1579000	Unfolded Raptor in our chatroom chat
1579000	1581000	Says ask for the Yaris with a tentacle
1581000	1583000	They'll take me seriously
1583000	1585000	When I go into that dealership
1585000	1587000	Alright and if you want to join along with us here on this Sunday night
1587000	1589000	Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com
1589000	1591000	If you're not listening to us live on Sunday why not?
1591000	1593000	You got something better to do?
1593000	1595000	Alright maybe you do and that's why we put it out as a podcast
1595000	1597000	But check it out Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com
1597000	1599000	Live on Sunday nights when we tape at AllGames.com
1599000	1601000	I also wanted to
1601000	1603000	Show us your tweets segment
1603000	1605000	You guys sometimes
1605000	1607000	Respond to our Twitter requests
1607000	1609000	At username O-L-R on Twitter
1609000	1611000	And just before the show I asked
1611000	1613000	Hey Twitter when and if
1613000	1615000	VideoGamesLive comes to your town what do you hope
1615000	1617000	They'll play? Because you know I think there was
1617000	1619000	Probably a song we wish they would have done
1619000	1621000	But they didn't do last night
1621000	1623000	For example I kind of secretly hope
1623000	1625000	The new song was like Kid Icarus
1625000	1627000	That would have been pretty rad
1627000	1629000	Is there something you were hoping for?
1629000	1631000	I would love to hear the Wild Arms intro
1631000	1633000	That's a really good piece of music
1633000	1635000	So some of the chatters showed us their tweets
1635000	1637000	Earlier on Twitter
1637000	1639000	D2 says the Guardian Legend of course
1639000	1641000	And I Love Pancakes
1641000	1643000	DJ Ratchet says I would want them to play
1643000	1645000	Either Passion by Utada Hikaru
1645000	1647000	Or the legendary theme for Guitar Man
1647000	1649000	Even though I don't think that one would work
1649000	1651000	And you know they do
1651000	1653000	Simple and Clean obviously
1653000	1655000	I think they do that one every show with the Disney montage
1655000	1657000	But I wouldn't mind
1657000	1659000	A little Kingdom Hearts 2 or a little bit of both
1659000	1661000	Who knows
1661000	1663000	Act Def says when they came to Mexicali I hope they would play
1663000	1665000	A Kirby song, sadly they didn't
1665000	1667000	A Kirby plus Orchestra equals awesome
1667000	1669000	Crows says they're coming to Houston
1669000	1671000	Late 2009, I want to hear a crapload
1671000	1673000	Of Ace Combat 5 songs and the main
1673000	1675000	Theme of Fallout 3
1675000	1677000	Ooh that makes me think Bethesda, Oblivion
1677000	1679000	Oblivion would be an awesome one here
1679000	1681000	Peeger Uno says
1681000	1683000	The Let's Tap theme tune
1683000	1685000	And Harry AKA says
1685000	1687000	Some of the beautiful music from Braid
1687000	1689000	That's not a bad suggestion either
1689000	1691000	Braid had a very kind of ambient soundtrack
1691000	1693000	That might be pretty awesome to hear live
1693000	1695000	And since they're always adding new stuff
1695000	1697000	Kind of shuffling it up, keeping it fresh
1697000	1699000	Who knows what's going to come to that in the future
1699000	1701000	Show us your tweets
1701000	1703000	By following us on Twitter username
1703000	1705000	O-L-R, you know what
1705000	1707000	I was going to mention
1707000	1709000	Something that I was going to play this week
1709000	1711000	But I didn't get a chance to and I really
1711000	1713000	Really sad
1713000	1715000	Oh I also played more Nobby Nobby Boy
1715000	1717000	And I still don't get any
1717000	1719000	What's going on with that
1719000	1721000	I might add that the Destructoid review of it
1721000	1723000	Is hilarious
1723000	1725000	And I couldn't stop laughing for the dumbest reason
1725000	1727000	They had this song
1727000	1729000	That was in the background
1729000	1731000	I don't even know what it's called
1731000	1733000	But something about wanting to smell your dick
1733000	1735000	Or something like that
1735000	1737000	You gotta watch it
1737000	1739000	It's just like the weirdest thing
1739000	1741000	But that song in the background
1741000	1743000	I was laughing for like 15 minutes afterwards
1743000	1745000	I'm like what the hell was that
1745000	1747000	Anyways, so completely off of that
1747000	1749000	LittleBigPlanet
1749000	1751000	They had a group
1751000	1753000	Of seven different creators
1753000	1755000	Actually go through
1755000	1757000	And create all
1757000	1759000	Eight stages
1759000	1761000	Of Contra
1761000	1763000	In LittleBigPlanet
1763000	1765000	I've played the first one before
1765000	1767000	It's fun, it's fun
1767000	1769000	It's a good translation
1769000	1771000	Yeah so they have all of them including
1771000	1773000	Levels where you're inside the bases
1773000	1775000	And stuff and it's in that same perspective
1775000	1777000	And everything
1777000	1779000	Pretty awesome, so definitely go check those out
1779000	1781000	I'm planning on downloading them all
1781000	1783000	But uh
1783000	1785000	Yeah that's it, and hopefully
1785000	1787000	I'm hoping that this whole
1787000	1789000	Hacking lost and damned thing works
1789000	1791000	To have some more funny videos
1791000	1793000	Coming out
1793000	1795000	It's funny if you break open
1795000	1797000	The lost and damned
1797000	1799000	Download content
1799000	1801000	It's actually in the exact same
1801000	1803000	Format as the PC
1803000	1805000	Version as far as the files that are in there
1805000	1807000	So
1807000	1809000	In theory you could edit it just like
1809000	1811000	The PC version and do all sorts of
1811000	1813000	Crazy shit, so I'm looking
1813000	1815000	Forward to trying that out
1815000	1817000	Interesting, by the way I'm going back and forth
1817000	1819000	A little bit in chat, apparently
1819000	1821000	According to our
1821000	1823000	Old buddy Bobby
1823000	1825000	There will never be Oblivion or
1825000	1827000	Prey or Guild Wars music heard
1827000	1829000	At Video Games Live
1829000	1831000	And apparently there's some type of feud going on
1831000	1833000	Between Jeremy Sule
1833000	1835000	The guy who does the music for all those
1835000	1837000	Games I just mentioned, and Tommy Tallarico
1837000	1839000	Like there's a big
1839000	1841000	Gamer composer feud going on
1841000	1843000	There or something, I don't know
1843000	1845000	Can't we all just get along
1845000	1847000	Yeah, never say never
1847000	1849000	Money talks
1849000	1851000	Things that we thought would never happen
1851000	1853000	Have happened
1853000	1855000	Whoever thought we would boot up our Nintendo
1855000	1857000	GameCube and see a Sega logo
1857000	1859000	Right?
1859000	1861000	Whoever thought there would have been a Marvel DC
1861000	1863000	crossover
1863000	1865000	That was old
1865000	1867000	Anyhow, other housekeeping this week
1867000	1869000	I don't really have a whole lot
1869000	1871000	Of housekeeping this week
1871000	1873000	I did housekeeping
1873000	1875000	Just continue to support us on the web
1875000	1877000	Again if you've not visited the new
1877000	1879000	Orangelaunchradio.com you need to
1879000	1881000	Check it out, DarkSakura uploaded some of the pictures
1881000	1883000	She took from Video Games Live actually
1883000	1885000	I uploaded the one to the main page there
1885000	1887000	Of the marquee, but if you go into
1887000	1889000	The OL Army picks on the gallery
1889000	1891000	You can actually upload your own pictures
1891000	1893000	And DarkSakura actually uploaded
1893000	1895000	Some things to the gallery
1895000	1897000	Including a picture of herself
1897000	1899000	Taken earlier today it looks like
1899000	1901000	Oh my god!
1901000	1903000	A wild Jamie approaches
1903000	1905000	Use your pester ball
1905000	1907000	And then some cool pictures from Video Games Live
1907000	1909000	I love my picture of Master Chief
1909000	1911000	Some of these came out great, you should send those to Tommy
1911000	1913000	I bet he'd get a kick out of that
1913000	1915000	Some of these are a little blurry, but that one and that one
1915000	1917000	Are really good, you should send those in
1917000	1919000	I took them with my iPhone
1919000	1921000	For iPhone pictures it's not bad
1921000	1923000	Somebody apparently uploaded a thing that says
1923000	1925000	Rob is officially gayer than Christmas
1925000	1927000	Rob versus Chris, you'll just have to
1927000	1929000	Check it out
1929000	1931000	No, I bet anything it was Travis and John
1931000	1933000	Last night on Understation Live
1933000	1935000	This just seems like something they'd do
1935000	1937000	This reeks of
1937000	1939000	John and Travis somehow
1939000	1941000	Like, hey, how can we fuck
1941000	1943000	With the new Orangelaunchradio.com, I know
1943000	1945000	Let's make a Rob is gay joke
1945000	1947000	Ah, see, isn't it fun
1947000	1949000	Being friends with them for so long
1949000	1951000	I know, I know, those little bastards
1951000	1953000	Alright, but I love them
1953000	1955000	In a totally homosexual way
1955000	1957000	Alright, let's get to some
1957000	1959000	Gaming news, low-key
1959000	1961000	Well, you may remember last week, Capcom was teasing
1961000	1963000	Something that they were going to announce
1963000	1965000	On Monday, well, that announcement
1965000	1967000	Was Lost Planet 2
1967000	1969000	And Lost Planet 2
1969000	1971000	Looks very epic, very cold
1971000	1973000	Still, yet strangely enough
1973000	1975000	Like in a jungle
1975000	1977000	It's a frozen jungle
1977000	1979000	But they have a bunch of other cool stuff
1979000	1981000	It looks pretty sweet
1981000	1983000	Right now
1983000	1985000	Only announced for the 360
1985000	1987000	And so it's
1987000	1989000	Possibly going to be a 360
1989000	1991000	Exclusive, at least for a while
1991000	1993000	But, you know, the first game was that way too
1993000	1995000	So, who knows
1995000	1997000	And then some other cool stuff
1997000	1999000	They're going to have 4 player online co-op
1999000	2001000	Which is pretty neat
2001000	2003000	And, I don't know, I think the game looks really cool
2003000	2005000	Different environments
2005000	2007000	They even have some sort of mech thing
2007000	2009000	Because before you can get the mech suits
2009000	2011000	Well, now these mech suits can get into a bigger mech suit
2011000	2013000	That's like
2013000	2015000	Voltron-esque
2015000	2017000	So, that looked kind of neat
2017000	2019000	But, very exciting
2019000	2023000	But, no word on when this is planning on
2023000	2025000	Being put out, but I'm sure we'll hear more about it
2025000	2027000	During E3
2027000	2029000	Well, I suppose that's a slight more surprise
2029000	2031000	Than Dead Rising 2, which is what we predicted
2031000	2033000	On last week's show would be the announcement
2033000	2035000	But at the same time, Lost Planet 2
2035000	2037000	Should not be that big of a surprise
2037000	2039000	Yeah, especially when you consider that
2039000	2041000	They have the Lost Planet movie
2041000	2043000	That they're pouring billions and billions of dollars into
2043000	2045000	And, you know
2045000	2047000	So
2047000	2049000	I guess that's not too big of a surprise
2049000	2051000	I was going to chat
2051000	2053000	By the way, Travis says it was not us
2053000	2055000	That did the Rob is Gator than Christmas picture
2055000	2057000	So, that was just forever a mystery
2057000	2059000	And now he's also saying Under Station Live
2059000	2061000	What if it was Fart Princess?
2061000	2063000	It could have been
2063000	2065000	Now he's also saying Under Station Live is coming to an end
2065000	2067000	And I'm just like, huh?
2067000	2069000	So, I want more information
2069000	2071000	On what this is all about
2071000	2073000	I'm going to call you later, Travis
2073000	2075000	You better call in later, Travis
2075000	2077000	I want details, what the hell is going on?
2077000	2079000	Alright, anyhow, back to video games for now
2079000	2081000	Assassin's Creed on the PSP
2081000	2083000	A lot of announcements coming out of Sony camp
2083000	2085000	This week about the PSP
2085000	2087000	One of their destination Playstation events
2087000	2089000	Assassin's Creed is going to be coming
2089000	2091000	To the PSP
2091000	2093000	Ubisoft will be putting it out on the
2093000	2095000	Sony portable system a little later this year
2095000	2097000	Apparently there's also going to be
2097000	2099000	An Assassin's Creed bundle coming out as well
2099000	2101000	With, you know, a PSP with it
2101000	2103000	So
2103000	2105000	There you go, Assassin's Creed coming out
2105000	2107000	A little later this year for you fans of that game
2107000	2109000	And also for fans of
2109000	2111000	Having games on the PSP
2111000	2113000	So there you go
2113000	2115000	In other news
2115000	2117000	Speaking of PSP stuff
2117000	2119000	Um
2119000	2121000	You know there's actually something
2121000	2123000	About LittleBigPlanet
2123000	2125000	It's going to be on PSP
2125000	2127000	Because I said so
2127000	2129000	And because apparently Sony says so too
2129000	2131000	And it's going to be sometime
2131000	2133000	Before the end of the year
2133000	2135000	That it is in conjunction with
2135000	2137000	Media Molecule and it's supposed to be
2137000	2139000	Very much like the PS3 version
2139000	2141000	Where you can
2141000	2143000	You know, make your levels
2143000	2145000	And share them and play the game
2145000	2147000	And play everybody else's crap
2147000	2149000	But just take it with you
2149000	2151000	You know what I think
2151000	2153000	I think that it's going to be
2153000	2155000	You would download everything
2155000	2157000	Through the Playstation
2157000	2159000	Like you do
2159000	2161000	Through the PS3 like you do now
2161000	2163000	With whatever link to the
2163000	2165000	PSP
2165000	2167000	I think that this is one of the biggest
2167000	2169000	Does to come out of the Playstation event
2169000	2171000	I mean LittleBigPlanet's been
2171000	2173000	You know, a huge new IP for them
2173000	2175000	Although I don't know how well it's been selling here in the US
2175000	2177000	But I think it's been doing much better overseas
2177000	2179000	But you know, I think this is no surprise
2179000	2181000	At all that they're putting a port of this
2181000	2183000	On the PSP, we had rumors about this a few months ago
2183000	2185000	No surprise here
2185000	2187000	I guess I am surprised though that Media Molecule's
2187000	2189000	Not doing it themselves, that's kind of
2189000	2191000	Interesting
2191000	2193000	I'm not surprised because they're busy doing like
2193000	2195000	You know, expansions and stuff
2195000	2197000	For the main game
2197000	2199000	Someone else port it, that's fine
2199000	2201000	As long as it turns out alright
2201000	2203000	I was going to say also that
2203000	2205000	You know, I think it's pretty cool
2205000	2207000	That they're actually taking the PSP
2207000	2209000	Seriously this year
2209000	2211000	You know, putting out some pretty strong games
2211000	2213000	Because remember last year and stuff
2213000	2215000	They're all like, oh that's the year of the PSP
2215000	2217000	And then nothing really came out
2217000	2219000	Other than the Crysis core
2219000	2221000	Or a new PSP, a new design
2221000	2223000	What baby do, but you know
2223000	2225000	I don't know, I think it's kind of cool
2225000	2227000	Something else that's going to be coming to the PSP
2227000	2229000	Another PS3 franchise there
2229000	2231000	Motorstorm Arctic Edge
2231000	2233000	Which is of course
2233000	2235000	Going to be more
2235000	2237000	Arctic themed
2237000	2239000	Than the other games that are going to add
2239000	2241000	Snowmobiles as well
2241000	2243000	You can expect all sorts of stuff
2243000	2245000	Including some of the stuff that they
2245000	2247000	Showed off in their pre-rendered
2247000	2249000	Intro video that they kind of do
2249000	2251000	No gameplay footage is actually shown
2251000	2253000	But you know, stuff like
2253000	2255000	Maybe interactive environments including
2255000	2257000	Avalanches, collapsing
2257000	2259000	Snowbridges, you name it
2259000	2261000	And of course always some
2261000	2263000	Poor sap falling off of a dirt bike
2263000	2265000	And getting hit by some giant
2265000	2267000	Vehicle
2267000	2269000	The game will also be
2269000	2271000	Ported to the PlayStation 2
2271000	2273000	As well, so
2273000	2275000	Because they tend to port a lot of those PSP
2275000	2277000	Games to the PS2 and vice versa
2277000	2279000	Makes sense
2279000	2281000	They're still cranking out PS2 games
2281000	2283000	Still selling well, so
2283000	2285000	Why not?
2285000	2287000	I guess the price is right
2287000	2289000	And it's probably pretty easy for them to port stuff like that to the PS2
2289000	2291000	Might as well, I mean
2291000	2293000	Get some more sales that way
2293000	2295000	Alright, well if none of those
2295000	2297000	Games sounded interesting to you at all
2297000	2299000	Maybe this is a little more up your alley
2299000	2301000	A new Hannah Montana
2301000	2303000	PSP bundle
2303000	2305000	Oh joy! That's right, this is coming out in
2305000	2307000	July, it's going to be a PSP in a
2307000	2309000	Brand new color called Lilac
2309000	2311000	Imagine if babies
2311000	2313000	Shit purple, and that's the color
2313000	2315000	Of this PSP, that's pretty much the best
2315000	2317000	Way to describe it, it will come with
2317000	2319000	A new Hannah Montana rhythm game
2319000	2321000	I wonder if this is the same game that
2321000	2323000	Did somebody let Footy Monster know
2323000	2325000	That this is coming out, because he's a big fan of the
2325000	2327000	Hannah Montana music games
2327000	2329000	But also it's coming out
2329000	2331000	With a UMD of episodes
2331000	2333000	From Hannah Montana, also a
2333000	2335000	Two gigabyte memory stick coming with it
2335000	2337000	And, and, and
2337000	2339000	Stickers to decorate your
2339000	2341000	PSP with Hannah Montana
2341000	2343000	So there you go
2343000	2345000	Apparently some also
2345000	2347000	Casual other things coming to the
2347000	2349000	PSP, Ubisoft has
2349000	2351000	His Pets series coming to the PSP
2351000	2353000	Pets Saddle Club
2353000	2355000	Being one of the first releases in September
2355000	2357000	Obviously this is happening
2357000	2359000	To compete with the DS a little bit
2359000	2361000	Because they have the whole Carrie Underwood
2361000	2363000	Playing a pink DS commercial
2363000	2365000	So Sony has
2365000	2367000	Now tapped into Hannah Montana, which is
2367000	2369000	You know what, lover or hater
2369000	2371000	It's a huge brand for
2371000	2373000	You know, tween girls, so
2373000	2375000	I guess this is the way to go, right
2375000	2377000	To try and sell some of these at Christmas time
2377000	2379000	That they've tapped Hannah Montana
2379000	2381000	Shh, isn't that illegal
2381000	2383000	You know what I mean, you ass
2383000	2385000	La la la la la la
2385000	2387000	Exactly, so
2387000	2389000	I don't know though, I
2389000	2391000	Kind of want a baby shit purple
2391000	2393000	PSP because I don't think anybody else would have
2393000	2395000	One, it is an interesting
2395000	2397000	Color, but I want one of the blue ones more
2397000	2399000	I think, I'll get the Madden pack
2399000	2401000	That came with the blue PSP
2401000	2403000	Even though I have a perfectly fine and
2403000	2405000	Functioning PSP right now
2405000	2407000	I kind of want the lilac one, but not bad enough to go for
2407000	2409000	Hannah Montana
2409000	2411000	I'm also just kind of like
2411000	2413000	You know the PSP 2 announcements coming
2413000	2415000	Probably at E3, so if I can at least
2415000	2417000	Make myself wait until E3 to upgrade
2417000	2419000	My PSP, then I'll have motivation
2419000	2421000	To just wait even longer until PSP 2 comes out
2421000	2423000	I think there will be something
2423000	2425000	There will be another revision
2425000	2427000	From what I heard, it was supposed to be even
2427000	2429000	Slimmer with a sliding screen, but that's
2429000	2431000	About it, I mean
2431000	2433000	It's still best to be the same thing
2433000	2435000	Eh, whatever, who cares, it's not going to help
2435000	2437000	GioVedea in chat says
2437000	2439000	Tap ass and Hannah Montana
2439000	2441000	Should not be said in the same sentence
2441000	2443000	I apologize to any listener that was offended
2443000	2445000	Alright
2445000	2447000	Enough Hannah Montana, please
2447000	2449000	DarkSakura, help us change the subject
2449000	2451000	How about release dates?
2451000	2453000	Well we've got quite a bit for the UK
2453000	2455000	And I'm going to go on and go through next Sunday
2455000	2457000	Since it will already be after that
2457000	2459000	By the time they get this
2459000	2461000	So on March 4th, we have
2461000	2463000	Empire Total War
2463000	2465000	That's for PC
2465000	2467000	On the 6th, Battle Fantasia
2467000	2469000	There's also
2469000	2471000	New Play Control, Mario Power Tennis
2471000	2473000	Patapon 2
2473000	2475000	Tenchu, Shadow Assassins
2475000	2477000	Tom Clancy's Hawks
2477000	2479000	Watchmen, The End is Nigh
2479000	2481000	That's for PC, Xbox 360
2481000	2483000	And Playstation 3
2483000	2485000	And Flock for Xbox 360
2485000	2487000	The Playstation 3 version
2487000	2489000	Says it's out on the 9th
2489000	2491000	Yeah those are the
2491000	2493000	Live arcade games
2493000	2495000	Or Playstation Network games
2495000	2497000	Is that it?
2497000	2499000	Does it
2499000	2501000	Well in the US, there's actually quite a bit
2501000	2503000	Coming out this week
2503000	2505000	Lots of stuff, including
2505000	2507000	The big title, Halo Wars
2507000	2509000	Coming out on Xbox 360
2509000	2511000	On
2511000	2513000	PSP, we're getting
2513000	2515000	Phantasy Star Portable
2515000	2517000	Which is the remake of the Ambition of the
2517000	2519000	Illuminus expansion
2519000	2521000	We've also got MLB
2521000	2523000	Both O9
2523000	2525000	And 2K9
2525000	2527000	O9 of course coming out on all Sony
2527000	2529000	Platforms and 2K9
2529000	2531000	Coming out on pretty much everything but the
2531000	2533000	DS
2533000	2535000	version is getting MLB
2535000	2537000	2K9
2537000	2539000	Phantasy All Stars
2539000	2541000	Which is a weird looking game
2541000	2543000	But whatever
2543000	2545000	Empire Total War coming out on
2545000	2547000	PC
2547000	2549000	Also that week
2549000	2551000	We've got SBK Superbike World
2551000	2553000	Championship coming out on
2553000	2555000	PS3, Xbox 360
2555000	2557000	And Wii and Playstation 2
2557000	2559000	I believe
2559000	2561000	Also
2561000	2563000	Tom Clancy's Hawks
2563000	2565000	On Xbox 360
2565000	2567000	And on PS3
2567000	2569000	Wii Ski and Snowboard
2569000	2571000	On the Nintendo Wii
2571000	2573000	Kind of a sequel to that
2573000	2575000	Wii Ski game that came out last year
2575000	2577000	Also
2577000	2579000	Coming out
2579000	2581000	As well
2581000	2583000	Littlest Pet Shop Spring
2583000	2585000	Cause there's just not enough of those games
2585000	2587000	King of Fighters 98
2587000	2589000	Ultimate Match coming out on
2589000	2591000	Playstation 2
2591000	2593000	Little retro fighting action there
2593000	2595000	And then Spongebob vs.
2595000	2597000	The Big One Beach Party Cook Off
2597000	2599000	Your Spongebob themed Cookie Mama
2599000	2601000	Game
2601000	2603000	Sonic and the Black Knight
2603000	2605000	On the Wii
2605000	2607000	And
2607000	2609000	Finally
2609000	2611000	Sad
2611000	2613000	Thing to end on but Grey's Anatomy
2613000	2615000	Coming out on PC
2615000	2617000	DS and the Wii
2617000	2619000	I'm very curious to see
2619000	2621000	How that game performs
2621000	2623000	Because it's either going to start a trend
2623000	2625000	Of all these like you know
2625000	2627000	Interesting drama
2627000	2629000	It's not going to do well
2629000	2631000	I can tell you right now
2631000	2633000	They're putting it out for a reason right?
2633000	2635000	Yeah because they bought the license rates
2635000	2637000	These people put out weird stuff
2637000	2639000	Look at for example
2639000	2641000	On the DS there's a company bringing out
2641000	2643000	A Johnny Bravo game
2643000	2645000	Seriously?
2645000	2647000	A Johnny Bravo game now?
2647000	2649000	I bet that will outsell Grey's Anatomy
2649000	2651000	Yes it probably would actually
2651000	2653000	Alright let's head over to Japan
2653000	2655000	And look at some of the release dates in Japan
2655000	2657000	Because of course the types of things they get in Japan
2657000	2659000	Usually come out here a little later
2659000	2661000	Or around the same time as is the case of
2661000	2663000	Biohazard 5 is coming out on March 5th in Japan
2663000	2665000	Of course Biohazard is the Japanese name for
2665000	2667000	Anybody?
2667000	2669000	Anybody?
2669000	2671000	Your mom!
2671000	2673000	PlayStation 3
2673000	2675000	Also getting Biohazard 5
2675000	2677000	Which seems to be dominating the week over there this week
2677000	2679000	But don't count out
2679000	2681000	MLB 09 the show
2681000	2683000	And Senju no Valkyria
2683000	2685000	Is getting a price reduction as well
2685000	2687000	Which is just you know
2687000	2689000	Valkyria Chronicles over here in the US
2689000	2691000	On the Nintendo Wii
2691000	2693000	On March 5th
2693000	2695000	Only one big release is
2695000	2697000	Relaxuma
2697000	2699000	Mina de Goryuri
2699000	2701000	Sekkatsu is coming out
2701000	2703000	Which looks like a game with cute little animals
2703000	2705000	Um
2705000	2707000	There's no screenshots
2707000	2709000	Just cute little finger painted
2709000	2711000	Survivor horror game
2711000	2713000	Somehow I doubt it
2713000	2715000	I'm sorry to say
2715000	2717000	PlayStation 2 has Galaxy Angel 2
2717000	2719000	Coming out as well as Need for Speed
2719000	2721000	Pro Street and Sengokushi
2721000	2723000	X gets a price
2723000	2725000	Reduction as it moves into
2725000	2727000	A greatest hits type series over there
2727000	2729000	Nintendo DS 7th Dragon
2729000	2731000	Is a big release over there this week
2731000	2733000	That is a game coming from Sega
2733000	2735000	That's an RPG
2735000	2737000	Also coming out on the Nintendo DS
2737000	2739000	Kimo Koei
2739000	2741000	And Simple DS
2741000	2743000	Volume 47 because every week
2743000	2745000	It seems like over there there's another Simple DS game
2745000	2747000	Coming out
2747000	2749000	Lastly on the PSP
2749000	2751000	It looks like there's
2751000	2753000	They're getting the 3000
2753000	2755000	In blue this week in Japan
2755000	2757000	And red
2757000	2759000	And a lot of matching
2759000	2761000	Gear coming out to match that
2761000	2763000	Otherwise Mina no Golf
2763000	2765000	Portable which is just Hotshots Golf
2765000	2767000	Is getting a price reduction
2767000	2769000	There you go, not a lot of huge stuff in Japan this week
2769000	2771000	Since you have Resident Evil 5
2771000	2773000	New colors that they have for the DSI
2773000	2775000	Just the black and the
2775000	2777000	Crappy blue
2777000	2779000	No they have the new colors for
2779000	2781000	Japan
2781000	2783000	They have this weird
2783000	2785000	Not even maroon it's like a
2785000	2787000	Pinkish
2787000	2789000	Purple
2789000	2791000	Magenta color system
2791000	2793000	They got this weird lime green
2793000	2795000	And a dark blue
2795000	2797000	It's probably better than the colors here
2797000	2799000	That light blue is terrible
2799000	2801000	I don't want a DSI in that color
2801000	2803000	Well I don't really want a DSI anyway
2803000	2805000	I'm not sold on it yet
2805000	2807000	Me neither
2807000	2809000	Maybe when some of the DSI games start coming out
2809000	2811000	I hardly ever play handhelds unless I'm like
2811000	2813000	Embed sick or something you know
2813000	2815000	I'm just not a big handheld fan
2815000	2817000	It's when you have the flu
2817000	2819000	It's the flu system
2819000	2821000	It's the DS flu
2821000	2823000	Well how about some WiiWare stuff
2823000	2825000	Yeah give me a reason to turn on the Wii
2825000	2827000	Well you can get beer pong
2827000	2829000	Frat party games
2829000	2831000	You have a
2831000	2833000	Your table set up with
2833000	2835000	Four people
2835000	2837000	Up to four people playing
2837000	2839000	And you have to throw ping pong balls into a paper cup
2839000	2841000	Now is this story coming out of Europe
2841000	2843000	Because I would think, I thought we got that game
2843000	2845000	A while ago. Yeah this is Europe
2845000	2847000	Yeah I thought we had, but they had to change
2847000	2849000	It to like party toss or what did they call it
2849000	2851000	Pong toss
2851000	2853000	So they're actually getting beer pong over there
2853000	2855000	They're getting beer pong frat party games
2855000	2857000	I'm glad to hear their feathers aren't so ruffled over there
2857000	2859000	And they're getting speed pong
2859000	2861000	Where you use power ups
2861000	2863000	To slow your other people down
2863000	2865000	There's also snowboard riot
2865000	2867000	Where
2867000	2869000	You go down and you
2869000	2871000	Attack people and defend yourself
2871000	2873000	With your snowboard?
2873000	2875000	I guess. Or you riot in LA with a snowboard
2875000	2877000	That sounds like it could be kind of fun actually
2877000	2879000	It seems like road rash with a snowboard
2879000	2881000	That might be alright
2881000	2883000	So, anyway
2883000	2885000	The beer pong is 800 Wii points
2885000	2887000	Snowboard riot is 1000
2887000	2889000	And
2889000	2891000	I guess speed pong would also be 800
2891000	2893000	I suppose
2893000	2895000	And spoiler alert, beer pong's not worth it
2895000	2897000	For 800 points there
2897000	2899000	Dammit!
2899000	2901000	I was wanting to play it for myself
2901000	2903000	And find that out, Loki
2903000	2905000	Jerk
2905000	2907000	Seriously, you can buy cups and a ping pong ball
2907000	2909000	For cheaper
2909000	2911000	And you can get drunk
2911000	2913000	But only if you're 21 or over, please
2913000	2915000	I was gonna say
2915000	2917000	I don't know if you noticed, this week actually
2917000	2919000	Was the first week that they started offering
2919000	2921000	I guess over here, I thought they were available
2921000	2923000	Over here already, but
2923000	2925000	I thought we mentioned 64 games on the virtual console
2925000	2927000	I thought we mentioned it last week's show
2927000	2929000	I don't remember, maybe we didn't
2929000	2931000	Because I remember getting into a conversation about
2931000	2933000	No, I guess not, if they just came out on Monday
2933000	2935000	I guess we wouldn't have brought it up yet
2935000	2937000	Yeah, no, I saw that they were there
2937000	2939000	I haven't downloaded any yet
2939000	2941000	Because I'm still on my stupid little
2941000	2943000	I'm not downloading anything else kit
2943000	2945000	Well seriously, what, they announced a solution how long ago now?
2945000	2947000	And
2947000	2949000	Here's the thing, well
2949000	2951000	There is one thing that will break it
2951000	2953000	When the whole mission comes out, I have to get it
2953000	2955000	I have to
2955000	2957000	Because I loved that game on the Commodore 64
2957000	2959000	So that'll be the thing that gets me to break
2959000	2961000	But that didn't come out yet
2961000	2963000	So we'll see
2963000	2965000	I never agreed to do it
2965000	2967000	Well if I conveniently forget to turn on the Nintendo Wii 2
2967000	2969000	I probably won't even remember to download it
2969000	2971000	And if I just stay away from blog sites on Monday
2971000	2973000	I won't ever hear it's out
2973000	2975000	But now that I said that, I'll get a million emails
2975000	2977000	From listeners saying, hey Rob
2977000	2979000	Did you break your thing yet?
2979000	2981000	Well the whole mission came out today
2981000	2983000	Jerk
2983000	2985000	Seriously though, when are they gonna, they're probably gonna make this big announcement
2985000	2987000	At E3, it's like, yes
2987000	2989000	We're gonna have a storage solution
2989000	2991000	You know, we totally never announced this before
2991000	2993000	At Christmas, or you're gonna have to buy this new system to get it
2993000	2995000	Yeah, you're gonna have to buy, yeah
2995000	2997000	Ugh
2997000	2999000	Hate them
2999000	3001000	Hate them all
3001000	3003000	I love Nintendo
3003000	3005000	Because we have Choaniki
3005000	3007000	Whatever
3007000	3009000	So
3009000	3011000	There's this new game
3011000	3013000	That's kind of exciting
3013000	3015000	I guess
3015000	3017000	Since it does have Excite in the name
3017000	3019000	Excitebots Trick Racing
3019000	3021000	It's coming out on the Nintendo Wii
3021000	3023000	April 20th
3023000	3025000	And no one seems to know
3025000	3027000	What it is
3027000	3029000	It's so crazy
3029000	3031000	What exactly is ExciteTruck
3031000	3033000	Or ExciteBots
3033000	3035000	It is being made by the people that did ExciteTruck
3035000	3037000	And the ExciteBike
3037000	3039000	Or franchises
3039000	3041000	I've never heard this game, this is completely
3041000	3043000	No, this is, I've never, this is a shock
3043000	3045000	Completely new news to me
3045000	3047000	Complete utter shock to me
3047000	3049000	Okay, no, really, I have heard about this
3049000	3051000	And it's funny that no one seems to know
3051000	3053000	What the game is about
3053000	3055000	And
3055000	3057000	Probably better that they don't
3057000	3059000	I mean
3059000	3061000	Surely it wouldn't be something as stupid as like
3061000	3063000	The bots battle each other or something
3063000	3065000	Like it's a racing like robot
3065000	3067000	Thing where they actually like a
3067000	3069000	Mech thing, it wouldn't be that stupid would it
3069000	3071000	Yeah
3071000	3073000	It wouldn't be like, you know, that they took
3073000	3075000	This awesome racing game
3075000	3077000	And said, hey you know what would be awesome instead
3077000	3079000	Of making a, I don't know, a sequel to it
3079000	3081000	And just not really changing anything
3081000	3083000	But adding some more tracks
3083000	3085000	How about we just take the whole game, take a shit
3085000	3087000	On it and turn it into a party game
3087000	3089000	Ha ha
3089000	3091000	And then we have ExciteBots
3091000	3093000	No, they wouldn't do anything like that at all
3093000	3095000	Oh god, I hope not, in fact
3095000	3097000	It would be crazy like, you know, they could have
3097000	3099000	A weird synopsis for it or something
3099000	3101000	Um, just trying to think of what exactly
3101000	3103000	We would say
3103000	3105000	Ha ha
3105000	3107000	Um, I don't know
3107000	3109000	Um, make something up
3109000	3111000	Try to make up what a possible synopsis
3111000	3113000	For ExciteBots
3113000	3115000	Might read
3115000	3117000	ExciteBots, um, let me think here
3117000	3119000	Um
3119000	3121000	Um
3121000	3123000	Uh, let's see
3123000	3125000	If I were to guess
3125000	3127000	An ExciteBots
3127000	3129000	Trick racing synopsis
3129000	3131000	I would say that ExciteBots
3131000	3133000	Trick racing takes the big air thrills
3133000	3135000	And simple controls of ExciteTruck
3135000	3137000	And ramps up the fun with a non-stop
3137000	3139000	Barrage of funky challenges and minigames
3139000	3141000	Performed at a blinding speed
3141000	3143000	You won't believe your eyes when you find yourself
3143000	3145000	Shooting goals, throwing pies
3145000	3147000	Even playing poker in the middle of racing
3147000	3149000	Robotic animals, insects
3149000	3151000	Around off-road tracks
3151000	3153000	God damn, Loki
3153000	3155000	You are one hell of an improv artist
3155000	3157000	I know, it's so crazy
3157000	3159000	How poetic in your description
3159000	3161000	And I also might say that it would support two to six players
3161000	3163000	Over Wi-Fi
3163000	3165000	Why can't you be that eloquent normally?
3167000	3169000	I just don't have it in me
3169000	3171000	You just got excited about it
3171000	3173000	You're just too full of cheese
3173000	3175000	Sadly enough, I do want to play this game
3175000	3177000	I'm scared
3177000	3179000	That they fucked this up
3179000	3181000	And it's like
3181000	3183000	I've been waiting so long for an ExciteTruck
3183000	3185000	Sequel
3185000	3187000	And I know they fucked this up
3187000	3189000	It's like, you can't fuck this up
3189000	3191000	You just do the same thing, put out the same damn game
3191000	3193000	Just change the tracks, add different cars
3193000	3195000	You don't have to do anything
3195000	3197000	It's sold okay
3197000	3199000	But I know they fucked this up
3199000	3201000	And it's really scaring me
3201000	3203000	So I'm loading up this
3203000	3205000	To read this comment in chat
3205000	3207000	Um
3207000	3209000	X-Link says Excitebox
3209000	3211000	It will make you shit your pants
3211000	3213000	Which, by the way, this is a game I played a ton of this week
3213000	3215000	That Flash game
3215000	3217000	Don't shit your pants
3219000	3221000	That's my favorite
3221000	3223000	New little sound I've heard in a Flash game
3227000	3229000	Just Google it if you have no idea what I'm talking about
3229000	3231000	Um
3231000	3233000	Anyhow
3233000	3235000	Comments from chat, I'm sorry
3235000	3237000	No more comments from chat
3237000	3239000	Tigerclass says why can't they do a sequel to ExciteBike
3239000	3241000	ExciteBike
3241000	3243000	Not ExciteTruck, but ExciteBike
3243000	3245000	Um, they could do that
3245000	3247000	ExciteTruck with ExciteBikes in there
3247000	3249000	Oh my god, look at that
3249000	3251000	It's expanding on the franchise
3251000	3253000	Do it like MotorStorm, I mean come on
3253000	3255000	Oh no
3255000	3257000	People that play the Wii don't want to actually play a real game
3257000	3259000	They want to play another fucking party game
3259000	3261000	Because where will they get party games on the way
3261000	3263000	They're just not available
3263000	3265000	GS68 suggests ExcitePants
3267000	3269000	Mix the magic of ExciteTruck with the
3269000	3271000	Suspense of don't shit your pants
3271000	3273000	The game and you have ExcitePants
3273000	3275000	I'm, I'm, let me put it this way
3275000	3277000	We have a toilet at one end of the course
3277000	3279000	I'm still gonna play this game
3279000	3281000	I'm still gonna try it out
3281000	3283000	I'm just, the description so far
3283000	3285000	And the fact that I haven't seen any
3285000	3287000	Screenshots
3287000	3289000	Or know anything about it
3289000	3291000	It kind of scares me right now
3291000	3293000	But I don't understand how playing poker
3293000	3295000	And driving really fast
3295000	3297000	Correlate with each other
3297000	3299000	It makes no sense to me
3299000	3301000	You can always give this game the wife test
3301000	3303000	Does the wife like it?
3303000	3305000	Yes, that's definitely gonna happen
3305000	3307000	Uh, hey, other news
3307000	3309000	About the Nintendo Wii, now this sounds
3309000	3311000	Thank god, a lot different and I'm sure it's gonna
3311000	3313000	Get a lot of people very happy and I don't know how you feel
3313000	3315000	About this one, Loki
3315000	3317000	It was recently trademarked here in America
3317000	3319000	Final Fantasy IV The After Years
3319000	3321000	And that's a cell phone series
3321000	3323000	Over in Japan, well guess what?
3323000	3325000	It has been announced this week
3325000	3327000	That it's going to be coming out for
3327000	3329000	The Wii, well I guess it hasn't really been announced
3329000	3331000	But the ESRB has rated the title
3331000	3333000	An E on the Wii
3333000	3335000	So, uh, there you go
3335000	3337000	Final Fantasy IV The After Years
3337000	3339000	Apparently getting somewhat confirmed
3339000	3341000	For the Nintendo Wii
3341000	3343000	So, that probably won't be
3343000	3345000	Any mini games, I don't think it was over in Japan
3345000	3347000	And I think, if I remember correctly
3347000	3349000	I think the one in Japan was actually like
3349000	3351000	In the Final Fantasy IV engine
3351000	3353000	I think so, because it was a cell phone game
3353000	3355000	So I'm kind of curious to see if they
3355000	3357000	Still keep it looking like that on the Wii
3357000	3359000	It could be a download thing
3359000	3361000	Like it might be WiiWare, it might not necessarily be a disc
3361000	3363000	It could be something that's gonna be released
3363000	3365000	It's gonna be WiiWare, that's what it was supposed to be
3365000	3367000	That could be kind of cool then, because it could be
3367000	3369000	Like in the style of Mega Man 9, right?
3369000	3371000	That'd be cool
3371000	3373000	So, that
3373000	3375000	That could also be something that
3375000	3377000	Makes me want to break my little
3377000	3379000	Band, even though my hard drive
3379000	3381000	Is completely full
3381000	3383000	Come on, if they
3383000	3385000	Fuck this up
3385000	3387000	I'm out for blood
3387000	3389000	You heard it here first
3389000	3391000	Alright, so there you go, Final Fantasy IV The After Years
3391000	3393000	I want to definitely check that out
3393000	3395000	Well, there's a
3395000	3397000	Device that we've discussed on the show
3397000	3399000	A number of times, and I have
3399000	3401000	One myself in the family of it
3401000	3403000	Which I will not name nor say
3403000	3405000	Or let anyone know where
3405000	3407000	I'm hiding it, because I actually just found
3407000	3409000	It while I was cleaning it
3409000	3411000	Yeah, I can't find my DS
3411000	3413000	Thingy
3413000	3415000	No, I can't find my DS, too
3415000	3417000	And the thingy that's in the DS
3417000	3419000	I found my thingy
3419000	3421000	I found the thingy in the box
3421000	3423000	What thingy?
3423000	3425000	Okay, I have a Ninja Pass
3425000	3427000	I have not used it, I have nothing on it
3427000	3429000	I have a 4DS and an M3
3429000	3431000	And I put tons of pirated games on both of them
3431000	3433000	But, to be honest, I haven't played my DS
3433000	3435000	In forever, so much so that it's
3435000	3437000	Buried in a room somewhere, so
3437000	3439000	Back to my story
3439000	3441000	And it's funny that you mentioned the R4
3441000	3443000	That's why I bought it, too
3443000	3445000	Because, you know
3445000	3447000	The R4
3447000	3449000	Is now officially outlawed
3449000	3451000	In Japan
3451000	3453000	You cannot, um
3453000	3455000	There's actually an injunction
3455000	3457000	Filed against the Chinese
3457000	3459000	Um, manufacturer
3459000	3461000	Put out by the Tokyo District Court
3461000	3463000	And, um
3463000	3465000	It's now illegal to sell
3465000	3467000	Anywhere in Japan
3467000	3469000	Um
3469000	3471000	In fact, there, you can't find them
3471000	3473000	In stores anymore, at all
3473000	3475000	Um, Squeenix
3475000	3477000	Capcom, Nintendo
3477000	3479000	Um
3479000	3481000	You know, the big guys, they're
3481000	3483000	Saying that, you know
3483000	3485000	That because of the illegal sales
3485000	3487000	Um, you know, they're gonna also make
3487000	3489000	Sure that they're gonna
3489000	3491000	Try to, you know, knock down anyone
3491000	3493000	Who's selling the other types that are like
3493000	3495000	The R4
3495000	3497000	Um, but
3497000	3499000	Who knows, the other countries might be
3499000	3501000	Following suit
3501000	3503000	Interesting
3503000	3505000	We haven't heard about a lot of
3505000	3507000	Devices getting banned over there, so this is
3507000	3509000	Uh, and now, now
3509000	3511000	Loki, you're breaking the law
3511000	3513000	Of another country, but
3513000	3515000	Boo hoo
3515000	3517000	Rob
3517000	3519000	You see that cup
3519000	3521000	On the floor? What?
3521000	3523000	You get caned for that in Singapore
3523000	3525000	Oh gee, oh no
3525000	3527000	So you're breaking the law of another country
3527000	3529000	It doesn't matter, like I said, you know, I
3529000	3531000	I don't even play
3531000	3533000	My DS right now
3533000	3535000	Or my PSP
3535000	3537000	Uh, out of curiosity, is there anyone
3537000	3539000	In chat who owns one of these who thinks
3539000	3541000	This is, uh, you know, interesting
3541000	3543000	Surprising? Are you
3543000	3545000	Scared? Cause now you have one, or are you just
3545000	3547000	Like, whatever
3547000	3549000	I'm totally not surprised, to be honest
3549000	3551000	Yeah, I know, it's not, it's not totally surprising
3551000	3553000	But, uh, you know
3553000	3555000	Oh well, there's nothing
3555000	3557000	In, you know, unfortunately with the
3557000	3559000	Um, DS, they can't really flash it to
3559000	3561000	You know, not work
3561000	3563000	With, or to basically
3563000	3565000	Break it or anything, they can't do any firmware updates
3565000	3567000	Like they can with the, uh, PSP
3567000	3569000	Or whatever it means, they'll stop selling it
3569000	3571000	Or if you'll still be able to get them over here
3571000	3573000	Um
3573000	3575000	Well, they've already made them pretty hard to get
3575000	3577000	Um, in fact, when I was
3577000	3579000	Buying mine, um
3579000	3581000	They were pretty hard to get
3581000	3583000	And
3583000	3585000	You know, they were starting to pull them off, you know
3585000	3587000	Shelves online
3587000	3589000	And stuff like that, so that
3589000	3591000	You know, they wouldn't get in any lawsuit
3591000	3593000	Trouble, but, uh, luckily
3593000	3595000	I got both of mine, actually the M3
3595000	3597000	And the R4 are almost identical
3597000	3599000	In fact, I think there's like one little point
3599000	3601000	That you change on each chip that
3601000	3603000	You can convert them back and forth
3603000	3605000	And, um
3605000	3607000	I don't know, they work okay
3607000	3609000	You know, the one I bought, the M3 for
3609000	3611000	For Game Boy Advance
3611000	3613000	Homebrew stuff, because there was this one
3613000	3615000	Motocross game I wanted to try out, and there was some other
3615000	3617000	Like Zelda type game that I wanted to try out, that was kinda cool
3617000	3619000	Um
3619000	3621000	I haven't really played any ROMs
3621000	3623000	For the Game Boy Advance stuff
3623000	3625000	Not really interested in that
3625000	3627000	And, uh, DS stuff, it's fun to check stuff out
3627000	3629000	Every now and then, but really nothing holds my
3629000	3631000	Interest for
3631000	3633000	Hardly any time, so I don't
3633000	3635000	I just don't see the point in spending, you know, 20 bucks
3635000	3637000	On, you know, each of these games
3637000	3639000	And that's on a cheap game, you know
3639000	3641000	Unless you get something Square Enix, which is like
3641000	3643000	$40 for a fucking DS game
3643000	3645000	Which is retarded
3645000	3647000	Um, I just can't see myself
3647000	3649000	Spending that kind of money on a game that I'm only gonna
3649000	3651000	Play for a few hours and just kinda throw
3651000	3653000	You know, to the side
3653000	3655000	It's just my own thing, economy's tough, you know what
3655000	3657000	And I wasn't gonna buy your game anyways, so
3657000	3659000	But hey, I spend
3659000	3661000	My money, I spend plenty of money on
3661000	3663000	Other things, you know, like I said
3663000	3665000	You know, what, the last week or so
3665000	3667000	Or a couple weeks ago, I
3667000	3669000	Five copies of Lost and Damned, so
3669000	3671000	You know, I'm paying my money
3673000	3675000	Alright, let's move on with more news, we gotta wrap up Part A
3675000	3677000	Get to Part B tonight
3677000	3679000	Yes, um, so
3679000	3681000	Kind of a game that I like
3681000	3683000	Um, you know
3683000	3685000	Saints Row, well, another
3685000	3687000	Guy, a music artist
3687000	3689000	That has broken into the game genre as well
3689000	3691000	50 Cent is actually
3691000	3693000	Looking to option
3693000	3695000	Saints Row for a movie
3695000	3697000	Now
3697000	3699000	This sounds like an okay
3699000	3701000	Idea to me, but
3701000	3703000	Not that great, I don't know
3703000	3705000	There are some actual characters in Saints
3705000	3707000	Row, so it works, but then again
3707000	3709000	The whole game is very sandbox-ish
3709000	3711000	And you can make your own
3711000	3713000	You know, main characters, so
3713000	3715000	Designing who the main character
3715000	3717000	Is gonna be is a little bit tough, I think
3717000	3719000	But as far as an actual storyline goes
3719000	3721000	It's kind of compelling, there is one
3721000	3723000	But, I don't know
3723000	3725000	I think that type, anything that's
3725000	3727000	Sandbox-ish, as far as
3727000	3729000	Gameplay goes, it's gonna be very hard to
3729000	3731000	Um, make
3731000	3733000	A movie out of, but
3733000	3735000	Anyways, he's interested in it
3735000	3737000	He says, according to
3737000	3739000	50 Cent
3739000	3741000	He said that his
3741000	3743000	Relationship with THQ
3743000	3745000	Is very good, and
3745000	3747000	You'll see Saints Row, he's
3747000	3749000	Optioning the rights for that right now
3749000	3751000	Dude, I hope the plot is as awesome as
3751000	3753000	Blood on the Sand
3753000	3755000	You know, Blood on the Sand, I think to be honest
3755000	3757000	Is just
3757000	3759000	Fun, that's the whole point, it wasn't like
3759000	3761000	He was trying to be serious, I think it was just fun
3761000	3763000	Speaking of plot and movies
3763000	3765000	And something that didn't make our show
3765000	3767000	Roll tonight, but I was chatting with somebody before
3767000	3769000	The show about this, have you heard about
3769000	3771000	How horrifically the new
3771000	3773000	Street Fighter movie is doing, apparently it has a
3773000	3775000	0% on Rotten Tomatoes
3775000	3777000	Right now, oh I would believe it, I mean
3777000	3779000	It looks like crap, I'm sorry
3779000	3781000	I, one of my live journal friends went
3781000	3783000	And saw it and said it is worse than the original
3783000	3785000	Street Fighter movie, if you can imagine
3785000	3787000	Yeah, that was actually a ringing
3787000	3789000	Endorsement to me, I love bad movies
3789000	3791000	Now I kind of want to go see it
3791000	3793000	It's out? Yeah, it just came out on Friday
3793000	3795000	I completely forgot about it
3795000	3797000	I wonder how terrible it did at the box office
3797000	3799000	Because box office numbers come out
3799000	3801000	Let me go look
3801000	3803000	It was pretty much
3803000	3805000	Street Fighter the movie this week
3805000	3807000	And Jonas Brothers
3807000	3809000	In 3D
3809000	3811000	Okay, Madea Goes to Jail
3811000	3813000	Was the number one movie this week
3813000	3815000	With 16.5 million bucks
3815000	3817000	Jonas Brothers
3817000	3819000	12.7 million, which they say was
3819000	3821000	Actually underperforming compared to the Miley Cyrus
3821000	3823000	Movie a few months ago
3823000	3825000	Slumdog Millionaire 12.1 million
3825000	3827000	But it just won the Oscar
3827000	3829000	So it was not in the top 3
3829000	3831000	Nor was it 4
3831000	3833000	5 or 6
3833000	3835000	Or 7
3835000	3837000	Street Fighter came out its opening weekend
3837000	3839000	Number 8
3839000	3841000	4.6 million dollars
3841000	3843000	What did it beat? Confessions of a Shopaholic
3843000	3845000	In its third week of release
3845000	3847000	Ah, Friday the 13th
3847000	3849000	In its third week of release
3849000	3851000	Fired Up in its second week of release
3851000	3853000	Ah, but what beat it?
3853000	3855000	Paul Blart
3855000	3857000	Mall Cop in its seventh week of release
3857000	3859000	Hey, made more money than Street Fighter
3859000	3861000	The Legend of Chun-Li in its seventh week
3861000	3863000	Of release
3863000	3865000	Coraline, but I hear that's a good movie
3865000	3867000	So we don't need to make fun of that
3867000	3869000	It's Street
3869000	3871000	Okay, it's a Street Fighter movie
3871000	3873000	That has like
3873000	3875000	Hardly any
3875000	3877000	Characters in it that, you know, make any
3877000	3879000	Sense, you know, Bison doesn't even look like
3879000	3881000	Bison
3881000	3883000	Balrog is, I don't even know what
3883000	3885000	Kinda character he's supposed to be playing
3885000	3887000	And Chun-Li doesn't even look like Chun-Li
3887000	3889000	And the plot's just like
3889000	3891000	Huh?
3891000	3893000	I hope they all do their pose
3893000	3895000	At the end though, that was the best part of the first movie
3895000	3897000	Alright, well hey
3897000	3899000	Speaking of game movies, a good
3899000	3901000	Game movie, I think anyway, a lot of people
3901000	3903000	Disagree with me, but one of the better ones
3903000	3905000	In many many years, in my opinion, Silent Hill
3905000	3907000	Was, you know, a video game movie
3907000	3909000	That came out, I liked it, we all
3909000	3911000	Generally liked it right here, I saw it four times in the
3911000	3913000	Theater, you really liked it, I saw it twice
3913000	3915000	Loki liked it, yeah, so I think we can all
3915000	3917000	Agree that the Silent Hill movie's pretty awesome
3917000	3919000	And of course
3919000	3921000	We love the series of games, love the series
3921000	3923000	Of games, well guess what, maybe not so much
3923000	3925000	The last few, but yeah, well
3925000	3927000	I didn't think they were terrible, but
3927000	3929000	Anyway, obviously one of the best ones
3929000	3931000	Was the first one, and guess what
3931000	3933000	Since we're talking about remaking games
3933000	3935000	For the Wii, a WiiMake if you will
3935000	3937000	There's been lots of these types of
3937000	3939000	WiiMakes coming out recently, now most of them
3939000	3941000	Granted have just been old GameCube games getting new
3941000	3943000	Controls, but what if they were to remake
3943000	3945000	The original PlayStation Silent Hill
3945000	3947000	Game on the Nintendo Wii
3947000	3949000	With extra fog?
3949000	3951000	Hopefully, you know why they did the fog
3951000	3953000	Why, cause loading or something?
3953000	3955000	Uh, well anyway
3955000	3957000	This is coming
3957000	3959000	From a report from VG
3959000	3961000	24-7, apparently Konami
3961000	3963000	Is planning a port
3963000	3965000	Of the Silent Hill game
3965000	3967000	For the Wii, also coming to the
3967000	3969000	PSP as well, Climax
3969000	3971000	The folks who did Silent Hill
3971000	3973000	Origins are the ones that are supposed to be doing this new
3973000	3975000	Remake, so that could be interesting
3975000	3977000	You know, I'm surprised that Climax
3977000	3979000	Has an exactly optioned
3979000	3981000	N-Spaces engine that they use for
3981000	3983000	The game that's not ever coming out
3983000	3985000	Unfortunately, Winter, cause remember
3985000	3987000	That game looked very much Silent Hill
3987000	3989000	Wonder if they're using it, though
3989000	3991000	You gotta wonder, maybe that's part of
3991000	3993000	Why they're doing this on the Wii
3993000	3995000	Is maybe the folks at Konami saw this
3995000	3997000	And was like, hey, we want you to
3997000	3999000	Make this a Silent Hill game, but we got a really
3999000	4001000	Good idea, why don't you redo the
4001000	4003000	First story, or something like that, you know?
4003000	4005000	Could be
4005000	4007000	Remake the first one is a test of your skill
4007000	4009000	Could be, huh?
4009000	4011000	Why don't they just make a new one?
4011000	4013000	Well, maybe they want the new ones to be
4013000	4015000	On the 360 in PlayStation 3
4015000	4017000	Stop remaking shit, seriously!
4017000	4019000	I want a remake
4019000	4021000	I wouldn't mind a remake in the first game
4021000	4023000	I really freaking want a good Silent Hill remake
4023000	4025000	Here's the thing, it could be a remake
4025000	4027000	Like a new play control remake
4027000	4029000	Yoink, yoink, yoink, whatever, right?
4029000	4031000	But it could also be a remake like Metroid Zero
4031000	4033000	Which is an awesome remake
4033000	4035000	I hate to interrupt real quick
4035000	4037000	But I'm so glad that the
4037000	4039000	Monitor obstructed the camera's view
4039000	4041000	Of the gesture that you just made
4041000	4043000	Why? What'd I do?
4043000	4045000	Oh, yeah
4045000	4047000	That's why we have the big monitor here
4047000	4049000	It censors my hand when I do things like that
4049000	4051000	So no one can see Rob fapping
4051000	4053000	Alright, look
4053000	4055000	You know I have to derail it
4055000	4057000	Alright
4057000	4059000	Silent Hill, we want it
4059000	4061000	You know other stuff we want?
4061000	4063000	Punch out!
4063000	4065000	Nah, I just want to punch
4065000	4067000	So, so
4067000	4069000	Getting this
4069000	4071000	May 18th, we're getting Punch Out on the Wii
4071000	4073000	And little Mac looks like he
4073000	4075000	All done grown up
4075000	4077000	He actually looks kind of mean in this picture
4077000	4079000	So um
4079000	4081000	We will be getting some um
4081000	4083000	Punch out and hopefully
4083000	4085000	That we will get like King Hippo and
4085000	4087000	You know Glass Joe and all of those
4087000	4089000	I hope they make new characters though, I mean
4089000	4091000	I'm sure we're gonna get new characters
4091000	4093000	I think they'll have to be some new characters
4093000	4095000	I will bet you, I will bet you there are not
4095000	4097000	New characters in this, I bet you it's just the remake
4097000	4099000	Of the first game
4099000	4101000	Really? You think they'd be that bold?
4101000	4103000	I think they'd be that lazy, yes
4103000	4105000	I do think that they'd be that lazy
4105000	4107000	I hope not
4107000	4109000	I'm sorry, I have no
4109000	4111000	Optimism in Nintendo anymore
4111000	4113000	Oh snap
4113000	4115000	Uh, GameGuru seems to
4115000	4117000	Kind of have that same skepticism saying I'll wait for
4117000	4119000	Reviews before getting Punch Out
4119000	4121000	From our chatroom, chat.orangeandredo.com
4121000	4123000	I mean, don't get me wrong, it looks good
4123000	4125000	But I just- You know what I say to your skepticism
4125000	4127000	Huh
4127000	4129000	Fine, say that all you want
4129000	4131000	But it's gonna happen the way I said it
4131000	4133000	So, Tigerclaw making an
4133000	4135000	Interesting point in chatroom regarding remakes
4135000	4137000	In this whole discussion, kind of talking about
4137000	4139000	Hollywood remakes, Tigerclaw says
4139000	4141000	Have you heard that Hollywood wants to remake the Never
4141000	4143000	Ending story, yes I did hear that this
4143000	4145000	Week, and geez Louise
4145000	4147000	Come up with a new idea, no
4147000	4149000	Exactly, no no no no no
4149000	4151000	You do not remake the Never Ending story
4151000	4153000	Cause they weren't that great, I mean they were
4153000	4155000	Okay, but the first movie is epic
4155000	4157000	If you're a kid though
4157000	4159000	Is that great, it remains epic
4159000	4161000	The other two
4161000	4163000	The second one had the guy who played the Flash
4163000	4165000	As the dad
4165000	4167000	It's always why I like that, because I kind of
4167000	4169000	Loved that show
4169000	4171000	Even though it failed
4171000	4173000	But I can do without a remake
4173000	4175000	Come on
4175000	4177000	If you can actually understand her name
4177000	4179000	Say my name
4179000	4181000	It won't make a point, you know
4181000	4183000	Say my name
4183000	4185000	You never understand what the hell he's saying
4185000	4187000	Anyway, forget it
4187000	4189000	Couple more stories and we'll get to part B
4189000	4191000	Classic Game of the Week coming up as well
4191000	4193000	Maybe that's her name, it's foreign
4193000	4195000	What?
4195000	4197000	So this week to coincide with the movie release
4197000	4199000	Xbox Live Arcade
4199000	4201000	PlayStation Network and PC will be
4201000	4203000	Getting the Watchmen The End is Nigh
4203000	4205000	The kind of prequels to
4205000	4207000	The whole Watchmen storyline
4207000	4209000	And it will be sold for a
4209000	4211000	Whopping $20
4211000	4213000	Or 1600 Microsoft points
4213000	4215000	On Xbox Live Arcade
4215000	4217000	That sounds a bit expensive to me
4217000	4219000	But it's supposed to be pretty good
4219000	4221000	It's kind of a brawler type game
4221000	4223000	But
4223000	4225000	20 bucks, really?
4225000	4227000	I'm gonna wait
4227000	4229000	This movie is also not getting some good early reviews
4229000	4231000	Although a lot of people
4231000	4233000	There's lots of fanboys with big big boners for Watchmen
4233000	4235000	You know, I'm interested to see it
4235000	4237000	But you know, I don't know
4237000	4239000	It looks okay
4239000	4241000	It looks okay
4241000	4243000	I'd see it, but not opening day
4243000	4245000	I'd kind of wait and see what some of my friends think about it
4245000	4247000	I mean, the story's interesting
4247000	4249000	But it's not like, oh my god, this is the best
4249000	4251000	Novel ever, you know, this is the best
4251000	4253000	Graphic novel ever, ever
4253000	4255000	Cause if that's the best graphic novel
4255000	4257000	That there ever was
4257000	4259000	Thank god, graphic novels suck
4259000	4261000	I mean, cause seriously
4261000	4263000	That is where you're setting the bar
4263000	4265000	I don't think so
4265000	4267000	Alright, well we'll see
4267000	4269000	One more story for you guys
4269000	4271000	And we'll get to the classic game of the week
4271000	4273000	And it has to do with EA
4273000	4275000	Could EA possibly be making their own music game soon?
4275000	4277000	And you might be thinking
4277000	4279000	Well, don't they already kind of do rock band?
4279000	4281000	Well, yeah, but they more distribute a game
4281000	4283000	That Harmonix is making
4283000	4285000	Here's the interesting thing
4285000	4287000	EA apparently, it was their chief operating officer
4287000	4289000	John Pleasence
4289000	4291000	Made a statement at the Goldman Sachs
4291000	4293000	Technology and Internet Conference
4293000	4295000	Quote, when we look back five years
4295000	4297000	The fantasy of being a rock star
4297000	4299000	By punching the buttons that are flowing down the screen
4299000	4301000	Is going to be one implementation
4301000	4303000	In what is going to be a very large category
4303000	4305000	There are lots of other things you can do with music
4305000	4307000	And we're working on interesting things
4307000	4309000	And we know our competition
4309000	4311000	Is working on interesting things
4311000	4313000	So, what exactly are they working on?
4313000	4315000	However, he went on to say
4315000	4317000	We're not in any position to announce anything
4317000	4319000	I think it's a robust category
4319000	4321000	Over the coming years
4321000	4323000	There will hopefully be lots of things
4323000	4325000	We will do in the music category
4325000	4327000	So, could EA be up to something?
4327000	4329000	Of course they're up to something
4329000	4331000	Music games are, you know
4331000	4333000	Selling like crazy right now
4333000	4335000	Of course they're trying to get another piece of that
4335000	4337000	So, I'm sure they're trying to think of something
4337000	4339000	We have some very interesting music gaming news
4339000	4341000	Coming up a little later in part B of our show
4341000	4343000	But first, we're about to our commercial break
4343000	4345000	Or, not really commercial break
4345000	4347000	But a free break of music here on Orange LA
4347000	4349000	And before we get to that though
4349000	4351000	We're going to get to our classic game of the week
4351000	4353000	Because we always like to pay respects
4353000	4357000	To a classic video game here at the end of part A every week
4357000	4359000	So, to do that, DarkSakura
4359000	4361000	Is going to dig through the gaming archives
4361000	4363000	And find a game that she thinks is worthy
4363000	4365000	Of being the classic game of the week
4365000	4367000	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4367000	4371000	The classic game of the week is Parasol Stars
4371000	4373000	Which is a fun little game
4373000	4375000	Did you ever play Parasol Stars, Rob?
4375000	4377000	Yes, I did actually
4377000	4383000	Parasol Stars is actually the...
4383000	4385000	It's in the series of Bubble Bobble
4385000	4389000	A direct sequel to Rainbow Islands
4389000	4393000	Where you basically use your parasols
4393000	4395000	To gather raindrops
4395000	4397000	Which you can shoot out at your little enemies
4397000	4399000	You can bop them
4399000	4401000	Or you can protect yourself from the enemies
4401000	4403000	With your little parasol
4403000	4411000	And it was actually the first one to never have an arcade release
4411000	4413000	It came out on the PC Engine in Japan
4413000	4417000	And then we got it thanks to Working Designs
4417000	4419000	I never realized it was never an arcade game
4419000	4425000	We got it from Working Designs though
4425000	4431000	In the US who was responsible for bringing us tons of different
4431000	4435000	Really awesome games from Japan
4435000	4437000	Like they gave us Ray Earth
4437000	4439000	Silhouette Mirage
4439000	4441000	Didn't they do Radiant Silver Gun?
4441000	4443000	I don't remember
4443000	4445000	They were responsible? No
4445000	4447000	But at any rate, it's you know
4447000	4453000	Oh yeah, another game that I covered on the show
4453000	4459000	Was Brainfart
4459000	4461000	Popful Mail
4461000	4463000	But anyway, back to Parasol Stars
4463000	4467000	So yeah, this is a Taito game
4467000	4469000	Came out in 1991
4469000	4471000	And you play as Bub and Bob
4471000	4475000	But you play as their human counterparts
4475000	4477000	Which would be...
4477000	4479000	The same characters from Rainbow Islands
4479000	4481000	Yeah, the same from Rainbow Islands, Bubby and Bobby
4485000	4487000	What creative names
4487000	4489000	It was only out on TurboGrafx
4489000	4491000	Wasn't it out on Super Nintendo as well?
4491000	4493000	I could be wrong
4493000	4495000	Sorry sorry, my bad
4495000	4497000	So basically Parasol Stars though
4497000	4501000	It was sort of retconned out of their continuity
4501000	4505000	Because Bub and Bob got turned back into little dragons
4505000	4507000	For Bubble Symphony and all those
4507000	4509000	Bubble Memories and Bubble Symphony
4509000	4515000	And so Parasol Stars is considered sort of a side story
4515000	4517000	A guide and a side story
4517000	4523000	To the whole bubble world
4523000	4525000	You know
4525000	4527000	At any rate, like I said
4527000	4529000	You can get different items
4529000	4531000	You can also
4531000	4533000	You have to collect these star items
4533000	4535000	As you go through that lets you access
4535000	4537000	These other planets
4537000	4539000	Because you're basically going through the levels and moving to other planets
4539000	4543000	So that you can get all the stuff to save the world
4543000	4545000	So you have 10 rounds on each planet
4545000	4547000	And there's a boss on each one
4547000	4549000	Except on level 30
4549000	4551000	Wait, wrong, sorry
4551000	4553000	But when you get the star items
4553000	4555000	You have access to two other planets
4555000	4557000	One that's around Bubble Bobble
4557000	4559000	And one around another game called Jack and Pop
4559000	4561000	They're not available on the main screen
4561000	4563000	You actually have to get stuff to unlock it
4563000	4565000	And then
4565000	4569000	You have the final boss
4569000	4571000	Who is the one responsible for stealing all the color
4571000	4573000	From the world
4573000	4575000	And
4575000	4577000	Is like the uber boss of everything
4577000	4579000	And so you get the true ending that way
4579000	4581000	So like I said
4581000	4583000	You gather the drops, you can throw them
4583000	4585000	And if you gather like
4585000	4587000	Five drops
4587000	4589000	Then you can just do the smack down with a big
4589000	4591000	Kick ass
4591000	4593000	Attack
4593000	4595000	So
4595000	4599000	Oh also each of the drops has a different elemental theme
4599000	4601000	So that's pretty cool
4601000	4603000	But yeah
4603000	4605000	As far as I'm aware
4605000	4607000	I think this did
4607000	4609000	I think it came out on
4609000	4611000	The Amiga
4611000	4613000	If I remember correctly
4613000	4615000	The Atari ST
4615000	4617000	There's a Game Boy version
4617000	4619000	The NES
4619000	4621000	I want to say
4621000	4623000	And
4623000	4625000	Of course the
4625000	4627000	Turbo Graphics 16
4627000	4629000	Or PC Engine
4629000	4631000	But yeah I think this came out on the
4631000	4633000	NES
4633000	4635000	Which is probably its most notable version
4635000	4637000	Is the Turbo Graphics one
4637000	4639000	There you go
4639000	4641000	Alright

4689000	4691000	Eat Lead
4691000	4693000	How's this game been going for you Loki?
4693000	4695000	It's going okay
4695000	4697000	I haven't been watching a lot of this on
4697000	4699000	Justin TV
4699000	4701000	I was running the house during the break
4701000	4703000	I was trying to get to a
4703000	4705000	Save point real quick
4705000	4707000	Did I just die?
4707000	4709000	I think you did because you turned your back
4709000	4711000	When something was going ahead
4711000	4713000	I haven't really been paying attention
4713000	4715000	Well I'll pause it for later
4715000	4717000	Alright maybe we'll look at it a little more
4717000	4719000	Actually no I'm not going to pause it I'm going to quit
4719000	4721000	Alright we got some
4721000	4723000	News we're going to get back into here on part B
4723000	4725000	We got to wait for Loki to get set up here
4725000	4727000	So um
4727000	4729000	I don't know how do we kill time at this point
4729000	4731000	Loki I need you to
4731000	4733000	Be here to start reading news at the top of the show
4733000	4735000	What are we going to do?
4735000	4737000	Alright we're
4737000	4739000	Resetting back up Justin TV if you're joining us
4739000	4741000	Here on this Sunday night
4741000	4743000	Justin TV slash Orange Launch Radio
4743000	4745000	If you want to see us live
4745000	4747000	Taping the show
4747000	4749000	And of course you can always join our chat room as well
4749000	4751000	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
4751000	4753000	Oh thank you
4753000	4755000	Breslull is there in chat and is reminding me
4755000	4757000	Of something I wanted to mention at some point during the show tonight
4757000	4759000	That is Orange Launch Radio
4759000	4761000	U.S. All March Madness is going on right now
4761000	4763000	And some surprising
4763000	4765000	Not ties but some surprising votes
4765000	4767000	Going on right now
4767000	4769000	Orange Launch Radio U.S. All March Madness
4769000	4771000	If I remember right last time I looked
4771000	4773000	Mega Man 2 is beating Ocarina of Time
4773000	4775000	Which is certainly a controversial
4775000	4777000	Little match up going on right now
4777000	4779000	But what's interesting is that there will be
4779000	4781000	Three things in the
4781000	4783000	Or three Zelda games in the top eight
4783000	4785000	If um
4785000	4787000	The voting does
4787000	4789000	Go in Zelda Ocarina of Time
4789000	4791000	Favor because I think right now
4791000	4793000	The Legend of Zelda and
4793000	4795000	Link to the Past
4795000	4797000	Are both ahead as well
4797000	4799000	Could be very interesting
4799000	4801000	How that all plays out
4801000	4803000	So again if you want to participate in that you can go to our forums
4803000	4805000	By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast
4805000	4807000	It will already be down to eight
4807000	4809000	But if you're listening live on this Sunday evening
4809000	4811000	They're at the Sweet 16 right now
4811000	4813000	So check that out
4813000	4815000	Alright
4815000	4817000	Almost done Loki?
4817000	4819000	Alright
4819000	4821000	He's just plugging the computer back in getting ready to do
4821000	4823000	The encoding for JustDB
4823000	4825000	You want to do an email real fast?
4825000	4827000	Sure why not?
4827000	4829000	Do a preliminary mailbag?
4829000	4831000	Yes because then that means there will be less to read later
4831000	4833000	Alright sure well let's start off with an email
4833000	4835000	I don't have the music though so uh just read an email
4835000	4837000	I have to read this because it's super amusing
4837000	4839000	This is an email from Sauce
4839000	4841000	Alrighty
4841000	4843000	Hey OLR I know you guys are fans of laughing at stupid people
4843000	4845000	So I thought I would share
4845000	4847000	A sad but true story with you
4847000	4849000	To make it video game related
4849000	4851000	Imagine Super Mario Brothers music playing in the background
4851000	4853000	Uh I might be able to arrange that actually
4853000	4855000	Okay
4855000	4857000	I'm sorry this is actually so funny that I do want to read it right away
4857000	4859000	Okay
4859000	4861000	Um on Friday afternoon I was at UNLV
4861000	4863000	Heading to my graphic design class
4863000	4865000	From the second floor of the building
4865000	4867000	This hallway is open air
4867000	4869000	You can see the major street
4869000	4871000	In front of the university
4871000	4873000	As I was heading into class
4873000	4875000	I witnessed a car accident
4875000	4877000	An old smaller size pickup truck rear-ended
4877000	4879000	An orange new beetle
4879000	4881000	A loud sound
4881000	4883000	So many of my classmates came out of the computer lab to see what had happened
4883000	4885000	As we watched the beetle pulled into the parking lot
4885000	4887000	In front of our building
4887000	4889000	The pickup truck sat there for about a minute
4889000	4891000	Without pulling out of the street
4891000	4893000	And then once the beetle's owner had gotten out of his car
4893000	4895000	The truck made a u-turn and sped off down the street
4895000	4897000	We were obviously quite appalled by this
4897000	4899000	But what could be done
4899000	4901000	We realized that none of us had gotten the guy's license plate
4901000	4903000	And then one of my classmates shouted down to the beetle driver
4903000	4905000	LOOK
4905000	4907000	And pointed to the street
4907000	4909000	And it became over music
4909000	4911000	Because in the middle of the street
4911000	4913000	Where the accident had occurred
4913000	4915000	Laid the front bumper of the truck
4915000	4917000	With the license plate still attached
4917000	4919000	The beetle owner called the police
4919000	4921000	And a few of us gave a statement to the police officer
4921000	4923000	About the accident
4923000	4925000	We don't know
4925000	4927000	We don't know why the guy in the truck took off
4927000	4929000	Maybe he didn't have insurance
4929000	4931000	Or maybe he had outstanding tickets
4931000	4933000	But I'm pretty sure the moral of the story
4933000	4935000	Is that if you're going to turn
4935000	4937000	A car accident that you were responsible for
4937000	4939000	Into a felony hit and run
4939000	4941000	You might want to make sure that you don't leave
4941000	4943000	Any incriminating evidence behind
4943000	4945000	Like your bumper and your license plate
4945000	4947000	I just wish I could have seen the look on the truck driver's face
4947000	4949000	When he got home and realized he had left his license plate behind
4949000	4951000	Cheers, Lauren
4957000	4959000	That was worthwhile
4959000	4961000	Alright, now let's get into some gaming news
4961000	4963000	That was a good story
4963000	4965000	Loki, yes
4965000	4967000	So
4967000	4969000	There's some interesting stuff
4969000	4971000	We've heard some controversy before
4971000	4973000	About Xbox Live names and
4973000	4975000	Profiles, etc. containing
4975000	4977000	Different things and getting accounts banned
4977000	4979000	Including
4979000	4981000	There was one that someone had made
4981000	4983000	That was to the effect of
4983000	4985000	Gay gamer or something like that
4985000	4987000	And they got banned because of the word
4987000	4989000	Gay in there
4989000	4991000	There was a guy named Richard
4991000	4993000	Which was his actual name
4993000	4995000	And he ended up getting banned as well
4995000	4997000	Because gay was in the name
4997000	4999000	Well now we have a self-identified lesbian
4999000	5001000	Being banned from Xbox Live
5001000	5003000	Because in her
5003000	5005000	I guess
5005000	5007000	Profile it said that she was a lesbian
5007000	5009000	And so
5009000	5011000	Apparently
5011000	5013000	That rubbed someone the wrong way
5013000	5015000	So she got banned
5015000	5017000	And
5017000	5019000	Now of course people
5019000	5021000	All are kind of up in arms
5021000	5023000	About the whole thing and
5023000	5025000	Apparently
5025000	5027000	Microsoft's Steven Toulouse
5027000	5029000	An Xbox Live team member
5029000	5031000	Has made a post on his
5031000	5033000	Personal blog regarding the situation
5033000	5035000	And they're hopefully going to explore some policy changes
5035000	5037000	And also
5037000	5039000	I guess Glad is waiting on the story
5039000	5041000	As well, so
5041000	5043000	Well, I just
5043000	5045000	I'll link it in the chatroom, I blogged about
5045000	5047000	This actually yesterday
5047000	5051000	I have choice things to say about
5051000	5055000	The way this was handled
5055000	5057000	And I think Inelegant does not
5057000	5059000	Even remotely
5059000	5061000	Touch what a crying shame it was
5061000	5063000	So
5063000	5065000	I won't say more than that
5065000	5067000	Basically the whole situation was
5067000	5069000	As Microsoft noted
5069000	5071000	In a statement they said
5071000	5073000	That users may not create a gamertag
5073000	5075000	Or use text in any
5075000	5077000	Profile field that includes
5077000	5079000	Comments that look, sound, like
5079000	5081000	Stand for, hint at, abbreviate
5081000	5083000	Or insinuate
5083000	5085000	Content of a potentially sexual nature
5085000	5087000	Profiles that do are asked
5087000	5089000	To change the language and are suspended
5089000	5091000	Until changes are made
5091000	5093000	And it says, I guess
5093000	5095000	The company also states it does not allow
5095000	5097000	Gamertags or profiles to identify any form
5097000	5099000	Of sexual orientation
5099000	5101000	Which is funny because there's nothing about that in their terms of usage
5101000	5103000	Nor their code of conduct
5103000	5105000	Nothing
5105000	5107000	I read the entire
5107000	5109000	Both of them
5109000	5111000	There is not a single thing
5111000	5113000	In the terms of usage
5113000	5115000	Or in the code of conduct
5115000	5117000	On Xbox.com
5117000	5119000	Nothing, zero
5119000	5121000	Zilch
5121000	5123000	I don't know, you'd think I'd have a stronger opinion on this
5123000	5125000	You know, being the gay one on the show
5125000	5127000	But I don't know
5127000	5129000	I kind of feel it might be one of those unfortunate things
5129000	5131000	There's a lot of these things on blog posts
5131000	5133000	That, you know, kind of take it and run
5133000	5135000	Tend to be, I kind of feel like it might be one of those things
5135000	5137000	That's being blown horrifically out of proportion
5137000	5139000	Like there just might be something
5139000	5141000	Else going on
5141000	5143000	I don't know, for all we know
5143000	5145000	For all we know, she could have been
5145000	5147000	Doing other questionable stuff on Xbox Live
5147000	5149000	We don't know
5149000	5151000	Basically what was going on
5151000	5153000	Did you actually read her post on the consumerist?
5153000	5155000	Yeah, I read all the things on the consumerist
5155000	5157000	But the consumerist is also not
5157000	5159000	Widely known for always doing complete research
5159000	5161000	According to other sites
5161000	5163000	But I'm saying from her post
5163000	5165000	Yeah, I saw her post
5165000	5167000	Well, the thing is that I've seen people on
5167000	5169000	Xbox Live do this
5169000	5171000	I've seen just, you know, blatant
5171000	5173000	Harassment going on
5173000	5175000	And, you know, people are like that
5175000	5177000	You know, outside of the virtual environment
5177000	5179000	Oh, don't get me wrong
5179000	5181000	That's totally inexcusable
5181000	5183000	And should definitely be dealt with
5183000	5185000	But there's no reason why someone
5185000	5187000	Shouldn't be able to, I mean
5187000	5189000	I actually agree that, you know
5189000	5191000	It shouldn't matter in the end
5191000	5193000	But, you know, if she's
5193000	5195000	Proud of it, why not have something
5195000	5197000	In her, you know, what is said
5197000	5199000	On the terms of usage on
5199000	5201000	Xbox Live was, and this is
5201000	5203000	Item number five, how you may not
5203000	5205000	Use the service
5205000	5207000	Create a gamertag avatar or use text
5207000	5209000	In other profile fields that may offend
5209000	5211000	Other members, that's what it said
5211000	5213000	So basically
5213000	5215000	It's, you know
5215000	5217000	It can be summarized as
5217000	5219000	The Xbox Live powers
5219000	5221000	That be saying, oh
5221000	5223000	Being gay is offensive
5223000	5225000	Because they're all offended
5225000	5227000	That you're a lesbian
5227000	5229000	That's
5229000	5231000	How, you know, that's pretty much
5231000	5233000	How it came out as
5233000	5235000	I wonder if any of these people that were harassing her
5235000	5237000	Were ever dealt with
5237000	5239000	If they were ever punished
5239000	5241000	Now see, what's interesting is that in Microsoft's response
5241000	5243000	To this whole thing, they say
5243000	5245000	In the Xbox Live terms of use
5245000	5247000	A member may not create a gamertag or use
5247000	5249000	Text in other profile fields that include
5249000	5251000	Comments that look, sound like, stand for, hint at
5251000	5253000	Abbreviate, or insinuate content
5253000	5255000	Of a potentially sexual nature
5255000	5257000	Profiles that do are asked to change the language
5257000	5259000	And suspended until changes are made
5259000	5261000	In regard to sexual orientation, for gamertags
5261000	5263000	Or profiles we do not allow expression
5263000	5265000	Of any type of orientation, be it
5265000	5267000	Hetero or other
5267000	5269000	That is not in
5269000	5271000	Their terms of usage, in fact
5271000	5273000	It's in terms of use right now
5273000	5275000	Could it be, make sure you're looking at Xbox Live
5275000	5277000	And not Xbox.com, because there probably are
5277000	5279000	Different ones
5279000	5281000	There's the Xbox Live terms of use, that's what I went to
5281000	5283000	So, hold on, let me find it real quick
5283000	5285000	Because, yeah, I'm curious kind of what, you know
5285000	5287000	Why they would say this
5287000	5289000	If it's not something, you know
5289000	5291000	And I realize they could be kind of blurring what's really there
5291000	5293000	And what it is
5293000	5295000	Here's what it says
5295000	5297000	Create a gamertag, avatar, or use text in the profile fields
5297000	5299000	That may offend other members
5299000	5301000	That includes comments that look like, sound like
5301000	5303000	Stand for, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate
5303000	5305000	Or relate to any of the following
5305000	5307000	Profane words, phrases, topics
5307000	5309000	Or content of a sexual nature
5309000	5311000	Hate speech, including but not limited to
5311000	5313000	Racial, ethnic, or religious slurs
5313000	5315000	Illegal drugs slash controlled substances
5315000	5317000	Or illegal activities
5317000	5319000	It does not say
5319000	5321000	Orientation
5321000	5323000	You know, just because
5323000	5325000	Just because, you know, if you put on there
5325000	5327000	Lesbian, it's not saying
5327000	5329000	Um, it's not the same
5329000	5331000	As exactly saying, I like to fuck chicks
5331000	5333000	And now
5333000	5335000	If she, because there were people
5335000	5337000	There were people up there
5337000	5339000	Who fully had, you know
5339000	5341000	Really sexist comments
5341000	5343000	In their profiles, I've seen them before
5343000	5345000	But, you know
5345000	5347000	Nothing about orientation
5347000	5349000	These were all, you know, pretty offensive things
5349000	5351000	You know, what happened to them?
5351000	5353000	Why aren't they banned?
5353000	5355000	You know, I don't think
5355000	5357000	That listing your orientation
5357000	5361000	Exactly relates to the act of fucking
5361000	5363000	Now if she said in there
5363000	5365000	Um, I'm a lesbian
5365000	5367000	And I like, you know
5367000	5369000	Big strap-ons, then I understand
5369000	5371000	Just put, I heart scissoring
5371000	5373000	Well you're, hey
5373000	5375000	I like cutting paper with scissors
5375000	5377000	Therefore it's scissoring
5377000	5379000	Here's my question
5379000	5381000	Is that if they allow her back on the service
5381000	5383000	Which is gonna be the inevitable conclusion
5383000	5385000	You know this is what's gonna happen
5385000	5387000	Is that Microsoft's gonna have to, you know
5387000	5389000	Kinda eat it up on this or whatever
5389000	5391000	And let this person back
5391000	5393000	Does that mean that Loki could go on and on his profile
5393000	5395000	Put, I love lesbians
5395000	5397000	There's nothing wrong with that
5397000	5399000	It's not, you know, slanderous
5399000	5401000	Or anything like that, it's just stating
5401000	5403000	What is probably a fact
5403000	5405000	Loki, do you love lesbians?
5405000	5407000	Some lesbians
5407000	5409000	I don't really love or hate them
5409000	5411000	Let's just assume Loki wants to put
5411000	5413000	His hands on his profile
5413000	5415000	It's like bird watching
5415000	5417000	For the matter of argument
5417000	5419000	I don't know
5419000	5421000	But do you see what I mean
5421000	5423000	They did not have anything
5423000	5425000	You know, he said in his comment
5425000	5427000	Including, you know, orientation
5427000	5429000	You know, listening to that
5429000	5431000	But nowhere in the terms of usage
5431000	5433000	That is a blatant lie
5433000	5435000	Interesting
5435000	5437000	He has lied to the public
5437000	5439000	Through MTV News
5439000	5441000	It is in print
5441000	5443000	On not just my own blog
5443000	5445000	But on plenty of news sites now
5445000	5447000	Where he is a goddamn liar
5447000	5449000	But, I don't know
5449000	5451000	I mean, still
5451000	5453000	It's not like they are talking to
5453000	5455000	GLAAD about the whole thing
5455000	5457000	And the human rights
5457000	5459000	Or whatever they're called
5459000	5461000	You know, the human rights campaign
5461000	5463000	HRC and all this stuff
5463000	5465000	It just seems like if they were that
5465000	5467000	You know, against all this or something
5467000	5469000	You know, in a way
5469000	5471000	I'm kind of glad that they're not star star
5471000	5473000	Starring it out like Sony does in
5473000	5475000	Home
5475000	5477000	It's basically, they have a list
5477000	5479000	Of banned words
5479000	5481000	That are considered offensive
5481000	5483000	And yeah, they have to unfortunately
5483000	5485000	Cover everything
5485000	5487000	Including, you know, homo
5487000	5489000	And all that stuff
5489000	5491000	And that's why they have the gay in there as well
5491000	5493000	Because people use it in derogatory fashion
5493000	5495000	And lesbian is in there as well
5495000	5497000	That's on this black list
5497000	5499000	But that's what it is
5499000	5501000	And because this person had it in their profile
5501000	5503000	That's why their account was banned
5503000	5505000	It's just like the guy Richard Gaywood or whatever
5505000	5507000	His name is Gaywood, that's his name
5507000	5509000	Hers wasn't a random banning
5509000	5511000	Hers was banned
5511000	5513000	When she reported
5513000	5515000	The harassment of other people against her
5515000	5517000	And they said, oh, well it's because of your
5517000	5519000	Profile ban
5519000	5521000	They banned her
5521000	5523000	Because other people were offended
5523000	5525000	Yeah, I'd agree
5525000	5527000	That's pretty messed up
5527000	5529000	They need to ban other
5529000	5531000	It's just rampant on Xbox Live
5531000	5533000	In some of those games, you know
5533000	5535000	They don't want me as a moderator
5535000	5537000	No
5537000	5539000	You know why they don't want me as a moderator
5539000	5541000	I will fuck their shit up
5541000	5543000	Seriously
5543000	5545000	They say, and you know, I've even seen
5545000	5547000	People that follow on Twitter, they're like
5547000	5549000	Seriously, when you see that stuff
5549000	5551000	You know, the fag, fag, fag, report it
5551000	5553000	They will do something about it
5553000	5555000	So, I don't know
5555000	5557000	I do, when I
5557000	5559000	When people annoy me on there, I report it
5559000	5561000	I'm a tattle
5561000	5563000	Basically what was happening though
5563000	5565000	Is all these people are following her from area to area
5565000	5567000	While she's trying to play a game
5567000	5569000	And just do her own thing
5569000	5571000	That's blatant harassment
5571000	5573000	Why haven't those people been banned
5573000	5575000	I mean, I think that if you go after someone
5575000	5577000	With malicious intent
5577000	5579000	Well, here's the question though
5579000	5581000	Because we don't know who they are
5581000	5583000	I would love to find out
5583000	5585000	But at the same time
5585000	5587000	You know, I think that any kind of
5587000	5589000	Malicious act like that
5589000	5591000	Should be immediately
5591000	5593000	Dealt with, I think that there needs to be
5593000	5595000	Some, I think that if
5595000	5597000	You're reported for a malicious act
5597000	5599000	Then you need to
5599000	5601000	At least have
5601000	5603000	You know
5603000	5605000	Get off my internet
5605000	5607000	Like, say an hour suspension
5607000	5609000	So that you're
5609000	5611000	The situation can be reviewed
5611000	5613000	Uh, cheeseburger
5613000	5615000	In chat, chat.orangelandradio.com says
5615000	5617000	All hail DarkSakura or ban
5617000	5619000	Haha
5619000	5621000	Uh, DarkSakura agrees
5621000	5623000	Ban the guy they're targeting
5623000	5625000	Um
5625000	5627000	Yeah
5627000	5629000	I don't know, I'm kinda curious to see what ultimately
5629000	5631000	Becomes of this, I still feel like it's kinda early on
5631000	5633000	I think we'll see more kinda come out of this next week
5633000	5635000	And I think we're gonna end up revisiting this topic
5635000	5637000	Next week, but in the meantime
5637000	5639000	If you have your own thoughts on it
5639000	5641000	You can give us a call later in the show
5641000	5643000	Or you can always send us an email, of course
5643000	5645000	DarkSakura loves emails
5645000	5647000	Mailbag at orangelandradio.com
5647000	5649000	Uh, well on Xbox Live
5649000	5651000	For those of you that haven't gotten banned from your profiles yet
5651000	5653000	There are some things to look forward to in the future
5653000	5655000	Worms Armageddon Decades
5655000	5657000	Is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade
5657000	5659000	Uh, this is
5659000	5661000	Apparently a
5661000	5663000	Like, old game, about 10 years old
5663000	5665000	It's coming out previously, what was this on before?
5665000	5667000	Like the Nintendo 64, I think, and the PlayStation
5667000	5669000	And PC
5669000	5671000	Uh, they're remaking this for Xbox Live Arcade
5671000	5673000	Which isn't too surprising when you consider that the original
5673000	5675000	Worms is a pretty good seller
5675000	5677000	On Xbox Live Arcade
5677000	5679000	So it's about time for a quote unquote
5679000	5681000	Sequel, and that's what this is
5681000	5683000	There you go
5683000	5685000	Worms Armageddon, coming out soon on Xbox Live
5685000	5687000	There was so much, my husband
5687000	5689000	Played Worms so much
5689000	5691000	It's no Scorched Earth
5691000	5693000	Just because I love Worms, it's no Scorched Earth
5693000	5695000	It's cute though
5695000	5697000	But Scorched Earth is hardcore
5697000	5699000	Did you play the other game that's like Scorched Earth, sorta?
5699000	5701000	Uh, no, what's it called?
5701000	5703000	Death Tanks? No, I haven't played that
5703000	5705000	That's on there, interesting
5705000	5707000	I don't know if it's any good, but
5707000	5709000	I love Scorched Earth
5709000	5711000	Who doesn't love Scorched Earth?
5711000	5713000	That game is awesome
5713000	5715000	Cause, it's hot
5715000	5717000	Talk about the game, silly pants
5717000	5719000	My pants aren't silly, they're denim
5719000	5721000	Moving on
5721000	5723000	Back to the Xbox Live Arcade
5723000	5725000	Even though they're
5725000	5727000	Bastards in charge
5727000	5729000	Um, I'm getting
5729000	5731000	And this is me specifically
5731000	5733000	Getting this, this is for me
5733000	5735000	At least in my own private universe, this is for me
5735000	5737000	One of my favorite
5737000	5739000	Ever games
5739000	5741000	Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade
5741000	5743000	According to Famitsu
5743000	5745000	Do we know what that is? I'll give you a clue
5745000	5747000	It involved twin sticks
5747000	5749000	I have twin sticks for this game
5749000	5751000	By the way, Rob
5751000	5753000	Did you know that?
5753000	5755000	Somehow I'm not surprised
5755000	5757000	Virtual On, Oratario Tangrum
5757000	5759000	Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade
5759000	5761000	And they can't use my twin sticks!
5761000	5763000	I actually have the Dreamcast twin sticks
5763000	5765000	You can
5765000	5767000	But you'd have to modify them
5767000	5769000	Ugh, no
5769000	5771000	I'll just make a converter
5771000	5773000	Um, but yeah
5773000	5775000	It's gonna be on there for
5775000	5777000	Uh, 1200 points
5777000	5779000	And, oh my god
5779000	5781000	I love this game
5781000	5783000	Now could you use the twin sticks on like the maim version
5783000	5785000	Or something? Do they even have a maim version?
5785000	5787000	There's a maim version, but
5787000	5789000	You have to have like the
5789000	5791000	I think you do have to
5791000	5793000	Play it with twin sticks
5793000	5795000	Cause they're twin analog
5795000	5797000	Yeah
5797000	5799000	I don't know, I want one of these cabinets in my house
5799000	5801000	Because this game is fucking sexy
5801000	5803000	Did Michael Jackson have one of these?
5803000	5805000	Huh? Did Michael Jackson have one of these for sale?
5805000	5807000	I don't know
5807000	5809000	I didn't look
5809000	5811000	Honestly though
5811000	5813000	There's only one more game really
5813000	5815000	Other than this that I would want to have a deluxe cab of
5815000	5817000	But
5817000	5819000	You probably can't guess what it is
5819000	5821000	Planet Harrier
5821000	5823000	But um
5823000	5825000	Anyway, but yeah
5825000	5827000	It's robot on robot action
5827000	5829000	Ooh kinky, but seriously
5829000	5831000	It's um, just beat em up
5831000	5833000	At the end of the game, and I actually
5833000	5835000	Have, um, Dan and I have two clocks
5835000	5837000	That Sega released
5837000	5839000	I have one of the Fayen, and then we've got
5839000	5841000	One of the last boss
5841000	5843000	The annoying bitch that he is
5843000	5845000	So
5845000	5847000	Get the game
5847000	5849000	Um
5849000	5851000	Well there's another game that you won't have to actually pay for
5851000	5853000	That will be coming to
5853000	5855000	Well actually you may have to pay for this one
5855000	5857000	Um
5857000	5859000	Quake 3 Arena for Xbox Live Arcade
5859000	5861000	Is close to being finished
5861000	5863000	And apparently this was first
5863000	5865000	Spotted as an ESRB link
5865000	5867000	Uh, a leak
5867000	5869000	Actually I do remember the leak, I think this was around E3 even
5869000	5871000	Last year
5871000	5873000	And um
5873000	5875000	Apparently it's um
5875000	5877000	Looking pretty good, and that kind of makes sense
5877000	5879000	You know with some of the other Quake themed stuff
5879000	5881000	That was um, or coming soon so
5881000	5883000	Um
5883000	5885000	Neat
5885000	5887000	You know speaking of Quake, I tried to get into Quake Live this week
5887000	5889000	And I see people talking about that in chat right now actually
5889000	5891000	Um, it looks like Hitstun's looking for people to play
5891000	5893000	Quake Live with, but I could not get past that queue
5893000	5895000	Cause you know the day it was announced
5895000	5897000	Thousands of people in the queue because everybody was
5897000	5899000	Uh, probably getting thrown to it
5899000	5901000	From different blog sites, but you know
5901000	5903000	I went back earlier today to try to check it out
5903000	5905000	And the queue was only 35 people
5905000	5907000	Which sadly I didn't have time to wait
5907000	5909000	Again because um, I had to do
5909000	5911000	This show tonight, but I'm gonna try and check it out a little
5911000	5913000	Later on tonight, but in looking at the demo videos
5913000	5915000	And stuff, it looks kinda awesome
5915000	5917000	I'm very curious to see if it plays
5917000	5919000	As well as it's advertised
5919000	5921000	It should limit everybody to one life, and then that way the queue will go faster
5921000	5923000	Maybe, I don't know, no I mean
5923000	5925000	You know it's gonna get hammered the first day
5925000	5927000	But it looks like it's eased up quite a bit
5927000	5929000	Cause the queue was only 35, that wouldn't have been that bad
5929000	5931000	You know I've seen WoW queues that were worse than that
5931000	5933000	But um, yeah
5933000	5935000	I guess right now, right this second there's no queue
5935000	5937000	So some of our listeners might be off to play that
5937000	5939000	Um, but I will probably check that out a little later tonight
5939000	5941000	So, we'll see
5941000	5943000	Um, and I would definitely
5943000	5945000	Check out Quake 3 Arena when it hits Xbox Live
5945000	5947000	That was one of my favorite Quake games, was the third one
5947000	5949000	There's a lot of games like that that are coming out
5949000	5951000	There's also that, um, other
5951000	5953000	Uh, god I don't remember the name of it now
5953000	5955000	But it was the one that they had
5955000	5957000	With the geophysics processor at one time
5957000	5959000	Um, that game
5959000	5961000	Uh, whatever
5961000	5963000	It's some psychic war game that's gonna be coming out
5963000	5965000	And then I think there's another game
5965000	5967000	Very similar to that as well, that's supposed to be on its way
5967000	5969000	So a lot of those arena, unreal
5969000	5971000	Type of tournament stuff
5971000	5973000	Coming out for Live Arcade
5973000	5975000	Makes sense because everybody
5975000	5977000	Loves first person shooters on the 360, you know
5977000	5979000	Mhmm
5979000	5981000	Uh, also big on the 360 soon
5981000	5983000	Will be Sam and Max, the first two
5983000	5985000	Seasons of Sam and Max are on their way
5985000	5987000	To Xbox Live Arcade, that's right
5987000	5989000	Sam and Max Save the World
5989000	5991000	Is the name of episode one, or season one
5991000	5993000	And Sam and Max Beyond Time
5993000	5995000	and Space season two, they are on their way
5995000	5997000	To Xbox Live Arcade
5997000	5999000	Uh, which is good because this will really expand the audience
5999000	6001000	So previously these games were only available on PC
6001000	6003000	I think a lot of people played them through GameTap
6003000	6005000	Um, I think they made their way to the Wii
6005000	6007000	Eventually, with the strong pack games
6007000	6009000	Uh, season one did
6009000	6011000	So, but finally they're gonna be making their way to Xbox Live Arcade
6011000	6013000	And this is where people will actually be able to download a demo
6013000	6015000	Because demos are mandatory on the Xbox Live games
6015000	6017000	I think you'll probably finally see
6017000	6019000	These games start to get a lot more of the
6019000	6021000	Attention it deserves, at least from the console people
6021000	6023000	I mean, I know a lot of PC gamers have already found their way to it
6023000	6025000	Uh, but this is gonna open it up
6025000	6027000	To a whole new audience
6027000	6029000	Good news, and kind of expected in a way
6029000	6031000	You kind of figured this was gonna happen eventually
6031000	6033000	So, there you go
6033000	6035000	Sam and Max coming soon to Xbox Live Arcade
6035000	6039000	Well, I have some interesting news
6039000	6041000	Oh really?
6041000	6043000	Has to do with the ESRB
6043000	6045000	More leaks?
6045000	6049000	Yep, classic rock track for rock band
6049000	6051000	Um, isn't that kind of cool
6051000	6053000	It's supposed to be getting a teen rating
6053000	6059000	And uh, it's actually on there for violent swearing and drug use
6059000	6061000	So
6061000	6065000	I think it's just that song pack that they're gonna put out of all previously released
6065000	6071000	They're saying The Joker, Take the Money and Run, and Holiday in Cambodia by the Dead Kennedys
6071000	6073000	Oh yeah, that's already there
6073000	6077000	Yeah, it sounds like it's gonna be like the rock band track pack one or whatever that is
6077000	6081000	Those were examples that were given about pretty much kind of the same thing to expect
6081000	6083000	Gotcha
6083000	6085000	Too bad they don't have independent achievements
6085000	6087000	That would make it a lot more worthwhile
6087000	6091000	You know, I wonder if that ACDC rock band game's really fallen in price yet
6091000	6093000	I'll get it when it's in the bargain bin
6093000	6095000	But I don't want to pay like
6095000	6098000	It's all live tracks too, it's kind of like ehhhh
6098000	6101000	I'll check it out just for, you know, because I'm an achievement whore
6101000	6103000	And the fact that, you know, I don't mind increasing my rock band library
6103000	6105000	There's a couple good ACDC songs
6105000	6108000	But, um, you know, I'm not gonna get it until it's in the $5 bin
6108000	6110000	Which you know it will be in Walmart eventually
6110000	6114000	And when it's in the $5 bin, you buy it, you dump the songs to your hard drive
6114000	6116000	And then you sell that shit back
6116000	6117000	There you go
6117000	6118000	There you go
6118000	6119000	Now you're talking
6119000	6120000	That's how we do it
6120000	6122000	This is how we roll
6122000	6123000	This is how we roll
6123000	6129000	Yeah, some other stuff that's interesting for Rock Band 2
6129000	6133000	The UK's finally getting a few different versions of Rock Band 2
6133000	6137000	Apparently the 360 version was on its exclusive kick over there as well
6137000	6142000	Now Rock Band 2 will be coming to the Playstation 3 and Playstation 2
6142000	6145000	On March 27th in the UK
6145000	6150000	And will be coming to the Wii on April 24th as well
6150000	6158000	And of course these will be available in their bundles, I believe
6158000	6161000	And, or actually maybe just game only right now
6161000	6166000	And then there's also gonna be the standalone stuff as well
6166000	6169000	And then I guess they are doing a bundle with the instrument edition
6169000	6172000	Which will include the drums, guitar, and microphone
6172000	6177000	I just wanna say, Unfolded Raptor in chat following up with the Rock Band thing we were talking about just a minute ago
6177000	6181000	I saw the ACDC at Walmart for $20 in the bargain bin, Rob
6181000	6182000	Some bargain, I agree
6182000	6185000	That's not that much down from the original asking price, right?
6185000	6186000	Yeah
6186000	6191000	But speaking of bargains, Hitstun reminds us that Lost Planet on the PC is $5 this weekend
6191000	6192000	On Steam
6192000	6195000	And that was a deal I was thinking about checking out
6195000	6198000	But then again, I never really cared for the demo, it's just not my kind of game
6198000	6201000	I understand why people like Lost Planet, but it's not my kind of game
6201000	6203000	I'm thinking about going back and playing Dead Rising again
6203000	6206000	Oh yeah, Dead Rising is fun, I wish I had multiplayer, I hope they do that in the second one
6206000	6207000	It'll be much fun
6207000	6208000	They will, I'm sure
6208000	6209000	They've got to
6209000	6212000	Alright, so hooray for the UK finally getting Rock Band
6212000	6217000	Well in other Rock Band news, obviously there was a lot of Playstation news this week at Destination Playstation
6217000	6220000	This sounds pretty awesome
6220000	6225000	Rock Band Unplugged is a game that's going to be coming out for the PSP
6225000	6227000	It's a rock band on a portable console
6227000	6229000	Very interesting when you consider where did Guitar Hero go?
6229000	6231000	The DS
6231000	6233000	But now you have Rock Band coming out on the PSP
6233000	6234000	But guess what?
6234000	6238000	There's not going to be any type of guitar attachment or drum attachment or anything like that
6238000	6245000	No, apparently a website named Primotek apparently has some details about what the gameplay could be like
6245000	6247000	Take this with a grain of salt
6247000	6249000	Some of this sounds a little bit like fanboy wank to me
6249000	6251000	This could be the real deal
6251000	6255000	I think it's the stuff from Destination Playstation probably
6255000	6259000	Well also kind of thinking back a couple weeks ago when they were, well let me get to that in a minute
6259000	6262000	Here's some of the possible gameplay details from this
6262000	6267000	Apparently you're going to be using the left, up, triangle and circle buttons to control instruments
6267000	6270000	And you also will go from instrument to instrument with the shoulder buttons
6270000	6275000	And then what you do, you play a segment of a certain instrument to get the score or the multiplier going
6275000	6277000	And then you switch to a different instrument
6277000	6280000	Hmm, what game am I describing?
6280000	6283000	Frequency and amplitude anybody?
6283000	6286000	And remember a couple weeks ago there was that guy who made the statement about
6286000	6290000	Oh we'd love to revisit frequency or amplitude someday when the opportunity presents itself
6290000	6295000	If you kind of, you know, tie that in with this, this definitely seems like a possibility
6295000	6298000	And a pretty good idea for a game
6298000	6300000	And one I would definitely pick up
6300000	6303000	This is like frequency and amplitude and that stuff, I'm all over this game
6303000	6305000	All over it
6305000	6308000	So hooray to that, and I know a lot of music game fans are very happy about that
6308000	6313000	Are you a big music game fan in frequency and amplitude, Dark Sakura?
6313000	6316000	Does this sound like something you might play?
6316000	6317000	Maybe
6317000	6319000	Again, songs are everything
6319000	6322000	You know, that's one other thing to keep in mind
6322000	6325000	Is that if the song list sucks, then forget it
6325000	6329000	However if MTV Games is involved, I'm sure they will be able to get the artist they need
6329000	6334000	So I would be far more interested in this than the Guitar Hero one
6334000	6336000	Because what I like, what kind of the difference is
6336000	6338000	Is that Guitar Hero DS was like
6338000	6346000	How do we take the Guitar Hero game on the 360 and on the, you know, Nintendo Wii
6346000	6348000	And smush it down into a DS
6348000	6351000	Where this is, okay how do we build a band
6351000	6355000	Or how do we build a game in the rock band genre on this platform
6355000	6357000	Knowing that these are our restrictions
6357000	6358000	Go
6358000	6361000	You know, I think that they're taking a completely different approach to it
6361000	6363000	I think will help them create the better game
6363000	6364000	But we'll see
6364000	6367000	We shall soon see
6367000	6369000	Well how about More Stuff?
6369000	6371000	More Stuff, my favorite
6371000	6376000	For iPhone people, there are actually two titles that are out by Taito
6376000	6378000	And no, they're not bubble wobble
6378000	6380000	The first is Cooking Mama
6380000	6384000	Where you can use the accelerometer and play your game
6384000	6388000	It's for $6.99 or 5 pounds, 5.5 euro
6388000	6390000	There's also Space Invaders
6390000	6394000	Where it's tilt and you can drag and you can use touch screen
6394000	6397000	And there's bonus character art and stuff
6397000	6399000	And it's like 5 bucks
6399000	6401000	So cool
6401000	6402000	Neat
6402000	6404000	I'm getting a little, I don't know
6404000	6407000	I'm getting a little sick of all the, let's take our existing things
6407000	6409000	And push them down into the iPhone
6409000	6411000	I'm putting on Try Cooking Mama
6411000	6413000	Good point for MacDeft and Chad
6413000	6415000	It's not Space Invaders Extreme
6415000	6418000	I'm a little, you know, I'm a little worn out on the old school Space Invaders
6418000	6420000	If it was Space Invaders Extreme with the awesome soundtrack
6420000	6422000	Which the iPhone would be a good platform for
6422000	6424000	I would be all over that, but
6424000	6426000	Doesn't sound like it
6426000	6428000	Oh well
6428000	6431000	Prince of Persia, the epilogue download content
6431000	6433000	Was supposed to have been out already
6433000	6435000	But it's been delayed to March 5th
6435000	6437000	Not that long of a wait though
6437000	6439000	The price has been announced at $10
6439000	6441000	And of course this game
6441000	6443000	It will pick up from the end of the game
6443000	6447000	And hopefully make up I guess for what was apparently
6447000	6449000	A crappy ending, I don't know
6449000	6452000	I never really played to the end of Prince of Persia
6452000	6454000	Actually I didn't get to the end either
6454000	6456000	Didn't really play Prince of Persia, but
6456000	6458000	I probably played a little more than you
6458000	6460000	It was a good time, but I just got distracted
6460000	6462000	Well you definitely played more than me because I didn't touch it at all
6462000	6464000	Oh well there you go
6464000	6466000	It's fine, you should pop it in and check it out
6466000	6468000	It's a fun game
6468000	6470000	You gave it to me, it was a good game
6470000	6472000	But um
6472000	6473000	Yeah
6473000	6475000	Easy achievements if you kept the 360 version
6475000	6478000	I have the PS3 one
6478000	6480000	So it's trophies, but still
6480000	6482000	Same idea, right?
6482000	6484000	Well once again it's just too many games coming out
6484000	6486000	I don't have enough time to play them all
6486000	6488000	Oh well
6488000	6490000	Well I'm one of those weird people that has a Netflix account
6490000	6492000	And I hardly ever use it
6492000	6494000	So it's like just a vacuum sucking my money away
6494000	6496000	Because I never watch the movies that they send me
6496000	6498000	But one thing I do love about Netflix
6498000	6500000	Is the streaming Netflix
6500000	6502000	One thing I like about the streaming
6502000	6505000	Versus the DVDs or Blu-ray through the mail
6505000	6507000	Is that you don't have to wait for streaming
6507000	6509000	If you want to watch something you can watch it right now
6509000	6511000	You don't have to wait for a disc to be delivered to you
6511000	6513000	So I love the Xbox 360 streaming
6513000	6515000	And I'm loving some of these rumors I'm hearing this week
6515000	6520000	Apparently Netflix is planning on a streaming only subscription
6520000	6522000	In the foreseeable future
6522000	6524000	This comes from a report from Reuters
6524000	6527000	Which is one of the massive news reporting agencies
6527000	6529000	Along with Associated Press
6529000	6531000	So yeah this sounds like it's coming in the future
6531000	6535000	No word if they're going to expand the amount that's offered on the streaming subscription
6535000	6538000	Because sadly there isn't a lot available right now
6538000	6540000	I mean there's some good like NBC TV shows
6540000	6543000	And you know there's some indie movies
6543000	6545000	And random ass documentaries
6545000	6547000	Are available on the service
6547000	6549000	But they don't have a lot of new news stuff you know
6549000	6551000	So it could use a little buffing up
6551000	6553000	But who knows
6553000	6557000	Apparently Netflix is considering launching a streaming only plan
6557000	6560000	But no word on exactly how much that's going to cost
6560000	6566000	Apparently Netflix just exploded in the amount of usage of the streaming movie service
6566000	6568000	In the last few months
6568000	6570000	No doubt from the 360 Netflix app
6570000	6573000	Which earlier was reported they have what a million people using it
6573000	6575000	So there you go
6575000	6577000	Hopefully it won't be that expensive
6577000	6581000	Apparently you know maybe I should just downgrade my plan to the $8.99 plan
6581000	6583000	Because right now I think I have like the $12 plan
6583000	6587000	So I should at least just download the one movie a month plan
6587000	6590000	Or one disc at a time, four movies a month or whatever it is
6590000	6592000	Because I just never watch the movies they send
6592000	6594000	I just never get around to it
6594000	6596000	Like I'm always in the mood for something else by the time I get the movie
6596000	6600000	I'm just that impatient I don't know
6600000	6603000	Alright anyhow let's take a trip into the old mailbag
6603000	6605000	Darkstalker read one letter a little bit ago
6605000	6607000	But now we're going to officially open up the mailbag
6607000	6610000	For your emails at mailbag.orangelawandtrader.com
6610000	6613000	Darkstalker is going to pick out a few of her favorite emails
6613000	6615000	And read them for you right now
6615000	6618000	I get a ton of emails so I'm not going to be able to read all of them
6618000	6623000	But did you lose a sock so do you like Dan?
6623000	6627000	Dan was very popular on the show
6627000	6629000	I saw some twits about it too and all that so
6629000	6631000	Jenai from Las Vegas actually
6631000	6633000	Oh god stupid thing
6633000	6635000	Sorry my plug keeps falling on my laptop
6635000	6639000	I would like to say episode 312 was hilarious
6639000	6642000	Dan and Loki's commentary made me fall out of my suit laughing while at work
6642000	6646000	Dan needs to be on the show more often he's got a great radio voice too
6646000	6650000	I love the new LLR website layout it has a nice citrus look to it
6650000	6654000	Peace slot machines and sugar cookies Jenai
6654000	6657000	You know I had an offer to go to Vegas in June
6657000	6660000	And you know I can't go because it's the same week as E3
6660000	6662000	Damn it
6662000	6666000	I really want to go back to Vegas though I will make that happen this year
6666000	6675000	Well there's just some really really long emails
6675000	6681000	The next one comes up from AcidicVampire
6681000	6688000	Hello there OLR this is Paul aka AcidicVampire with my virginal email to you guys
6688000	6690000	I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm a fairly new listener
6690000	6692000	Been listening since August of last year
6692000	6694000	That I enjoy the show immensely
6694000	6696000	History between all three hosts the terrific news
6696000	6701000	And Loki's disdain for every Imagine game released each week has sold me as an avid listener
6701000	6703000	Imagine hate
6703000	6707000	Now that my saccharine praise is out of the way I do have a valid question
6707000	6710000	Now I've only heard Sky mention that he has played this game before
6710000	6714000	But if DarkSakuraLoki has played this as well I wouldn't mind their input
6714000	6718000	After years of being released I am finally going to attempt to play Final Fantasy XI
6718000	6721000	For some odd reason I've been reading about it lately
6721000	6723000	And I've always put it aside as being one of those games I just had to play
6723000	6727000	I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan Final Fantasy VI for the win
6727000	6734000	But I said cast Final Fantasy XI aside because it was online and required a monthly fee to play
6734000	6738000	Well I bought the Vanadium collection recently for about 20 bucks
6738000	6742000	Which includes all four expansion packs and I'm ready to get my feet wet and get my Ferraga on
6742000	6748000	This will be my first MMORPG which I fear will exile me from other players on the servers
6748000	6750000	Because of my inexperience which leads to this question
6750000	6753000	What tips can you give a noob MMORPG player like me?
6753000	6758000	I like to play a Taru Taru Black Mage because they're so damn cute
6758000	6760000	But I know it'll take forever to level them up
6760000	6765000	I also like to interact with other players but I don't want them excited on me just because I'm new to the game
6765000	6767000	They've been playing the game for five plus years
6767000	6769000	Any input you have
6769000	6771000	I'm sorry
6771000	6774000	Any input you or even the chat room can give me would be greatly appreciated
6774000	6777000	Thanks for your time and here's to another 300 shows
6777000	6779000	Gay gamers unite
6779000	6782000	I'll leave that to you, I played but I didn't like it
6782000	6784000	Yeah, turn around and run while you still can
6784000	6786000	Do not allow yourself to get sucked into this game
6786000	6789000	No, you know what, I've heard a lot's changed since the time I left
6789000	6796000	You know what, Loki actually, Loki did spend just as long as I did in the clutches of Vanadil if not a little longer
6796000	6799000	I don't know, Loki, what was your thoughts?
6799000	6801000	I liked it, it was fun
6801000	6810000	It sucked waiting for parties and now that they've fixed the having to party with people
6810000	6813000	I think that would be a lot more fun now
6813000	6818000	That was kind of the thing that broke it for me is, well other than that I didn't have time to play
6818000	6824000	Is just waiting for a party and you're like, okay I have two hours to play this
6824000	6829000	And of that two hours you're spending an hour and 45 minutes waiting for a party
6829000	6832000	And it's like by the time you're, it's like crap I don't have time to play anymore
6832000	6834000	Well 15 minutes of a party yay
6834000	6837000	Or you know someone else leaves and you have to wait for a party
6837000	6841000	Yeah I feel like I heard they changed a lot of very fundamental things about the game
6841000	6845000	Including the whole level sync thing that like I can't give this a fair shot
6845000	6849000	You know cause I could sit here and bitch about every reason why I left it
6849000	6852000	But I'm not giving the game a fair shot because they've addressed some of those issues
6852000	6854000	You know the economy was the biggest thing for me
6854000	6858000	I thought it was absolute bullshit that if you wanted to get anywhere in the economy of the game
6858000	6863000	You pretty much had to buy gold because they were refusing to do anything about the, or Gil or whatever
6863000	6865000	They were refusing to do anything about the Gil sellers in the game
6865000	6870000	But about three, four months after I left they finally started banning people for it
6870000	6871000	And they were pretty aggressive about it
6871000	6875000	Now granted you'll never eliminate it but I'm sure that's helped the economy tremendously in that game
6875000	6877000	Because the Gil sellers were ruining the game
6877000	6881000	But it's just unfortunate the Square let it go on so long
6881000	6884000	You know they didn't, kind of weren't, you know they lost some people like me
6884000	6886000	Because they just weren't more aggressive with it
6886000	6890000	So I don't know, I feel like I can't give the game a fair review
6890000	6893000	But dude you already bought the pack, it comes with a free month of the game
6893000	6896000	Go install it, have a blast, go play for that month
6896000	6898000	I'm almost curious to see how it would run on my PC now
6898000	6900000	Yeah I know, I bet it would look nice
6900000	6903000	But I don't know, you know one thing I prefer
6903000	6908000	I'll tell you something, to be fair I'll tell you something I prefer on Final Fantasy 11 compared to WoW
6908000	6911000	I like exploring in Final Fantasy 11 a lot more
6911000	6914000	And it's weird because the graphics aren't necessarily better
6914000	6915000	They're just a different type
6915000	6917000	And like when you go into a new world in Final Fantasy 11
6917000	6919000	Like a place you've never been before
6919000	6921000	It's like oh wow, it's scary as shit
6921000	6923000	Yeah sometimes it's scary as shit
6923000	6925000	Like especially the first time you're in Gunga mines and you hear the sirens go off
6925000	6927000	You're like what the fuck is that?
6927000	6932000	But you know, like Final Fantasy 11 you really get a sense of exploration in that game
6932000	6935000	And like just the world is so vast in that game
6935000	6939000	And it's not that WoW doesn't have its own neat levels and areas and things like that
6939000	6942000	But I don't know, there's something about Final Fantasy 11
6942000	6945000	Where I feel more sense of an accomplishment when it comes to exploring
6945000	6947000	WoW takes itself more seriously I think
6947000	6950000	Versus, you know, or not WoW takes
6950000	6954000	Final Fantasy 11 takes itself more seriously than WoW
6954000	6959000	So, hitstun asked in chat so what happened to make WoW suck now
6959000	6960000	Actually WoW doesn't suck
6960000	6962000	I don't have a problem with WoW at all
6962000	6966000	But I just had to quit because I just was spending too much time on it
6966000	6968000	Or take a vacation, I don't want to say I quit
6968000	6969000	Because that makes it sound like I'm never going to go back
6969000	6971000	And that's not the case, I'm actually probably going to go back pretty soon
6971000	6975000	But I just needed a break to do other things
6975000	6977000	So, hooray
6977000	6979000	Alright, next email then
6979000	6981000	Next email
6981000	6986000	Hey O.L.R. I have a request for the new Gamestop hate board
6986000	6989000	They don't sell classic games or system anymore
6989000	6992000	I was too young when they did and I got into classic gaming
6992000	6994000	They send them off to the warehouse to gather dust
6994000	6997000	So F you to Gamestop for lack of classic video games
6997000	7000000	How dare they call themselves a game store, that's from Cheeseburger
7000000	7002000	Good suggestion
7002000	7004000	Unfortunately the white board is down for repairs right now
7004000	7006000	But we will definitely add that when it comes back
7010000	7014000	Alright, one from Spassinator and then I'm going to read the long long one after that
7014000	7015000	Alright
7015000	7018000	Hi folks, I'm writing in today with a few questions and comments
7018000	7020000	Firstly, although perhaps not a big deal
7020000	7021000	But I'll address it anyway
7021000	7024000	I'd like to apologize for the mess of an email that it sent last week
7024000	7026000	With the poor grammar and spelling, don't worry about it
7026000	7027000	I'm giving a hard time
7027000	7029000	Normally I take the time to make sure everything is correct
7029000	7031000	But considering that I was typing in a hurry
7031000	7033000	And the fact that play online has no spell check
7033000	7035000	And the fact that my glucose levels were out of whack at the time
7035000	7037000	Side note, I'm diabetic and abnormal
7037000	7040000	Glucose levels cause me to get confused
7040000	7042000	But I'll end up being a factor in the issue
7042000	7045000	I really, I give everybody a hard time
7045000	7047000	It's not serious
7047000	7049000	She's an equal opportunity offender
7049000	7051000	Oh, bite me
7051000	7054000	Now that issue's out of the way, here's a few questions
7054000	7057000	One, can you recall any events in your lives or wow moments
7057000	7060000	That basically you had
7060000	7064000	You think to yourself something along the lines of yes, video games is a hobby
7064000	7065000	That I want to get into
7065000	7068000	For me it's the first time I set foot into a showbiz pizza place
7068000	7070000	Formerly a competitor of Chuck E. Cheese's
7070000	7074000	They're actually owned by Pizza Time Entertainment
7074000	7077000	That was started by
7077000	7079000	Fuck
7079000	7081000	I don't think it was started by fuck
7081000	7083000	Nolan Bushnell
7083000	7086000	I just want to let you suffer a little bit before I help you
7086000	7091000	It was going to my friend's house
7091000	7094000	No shit, cause I was little in indie games
7094000	7099000	I was born playing video games practically
7099000	7104000	I just played a lot of Odyssey 2 when I was little little
7104000	7110000	And I never thought about wow, I'd like to do this as a hobby
7110000	7112000	It just sort of happened
7112000	7118000	I was a little kid when all of this was new and interesting
7118000	7120000	But it was just more like
7120000	7123000	Hey look, mom brought home a clique-o-vision, that's cool
7123000	7128000	Oh, I'm going to go play kicks during break at school
7128000	7133000	It just didn't factor in as a wow
7133000	7136000	It was a part of my life, always
7136000	7137000	Not a big deal
7137000	7139000	Rob?
7139000	7141000	I'm sorry, what are we answering?
7141000	7144000	What was your wow, I really like video games?
7144000	7146000	What got you into video games pretty much?
7146000	7148000	Oh god
7148000	7150000	I'm almost in the same boat
7150000	7154000	I just remember the day we hooked up the Atari 2600
7154000	7156000	Just the fact that I was interacting with it
7156000	7159000	No, it really was the Commodore 64
7159000	7161000	I think, that really got me into games
7161000	7164000	I don't know, the games
7164000	7167000	I can't remember a single moment because I was so young
7167000	7170000	You don't remember a lot when you're 4 or 5
7170000	7173000	But I've just always been playing Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 games
7173000	7176000	And just been having a good time with the game
7176000	7181000	You know, maybe, I don't remember Dark Sakura's upbringing stories
7181000	7183000	But I know in my particular situation
7183000	7186000	My brother and sister are much older than I am
7186000	7188000	14 years and 16 years older than I am
7188000	7191000	So I was kind of an only child, not really
7191000	7194000	But one reason I played video games is because
7194000	7198000	I didn't have other kids to set up and play board games with
7198000	7200000	Or, you know, go out and play on the lawn with
7200000	7202000	I mean, granted, I had neighborhood friends and stuff
7202000	7204000	They don't want to hang out every day
7204000	7206000	So, you know, video games were a way to pass time
7206000	7208000	You know, it would entertain me
7208000	7210000	There were not always a lot of other people around
7210000	7212000	If that makes sense
7212000	7214000	So, Loki, anything for you?
7214000	7216000	Why are you into video games?
7216000	7218000	I don't know, because I always played video games
7218000	7220000	I know, it's tough
7220000	7222000	I don't want to say, it's just a tough question
7222000	7224000	There's nothing, really
7224000	7226000	Just having video games from like when I was 4 or 5
7226000	7228000	You know, that pretty much
7228000	7230000	That'll do it
7230000	7232000	So there you go
7232000	7234000	You look at the stuff you did when you were a little kid
7234000	7236000	You end up looking at it now
7236000	7238000	And you're doing the same stuff
7238000	7240000	You know, I liked tinkering with things
7240000	7242000	And playing video games
7242000	7244000	And messing around on a computer
7244000	7246000	And sure enough, I'm doing the same damn stuff now
7246000	7250000	We were just all born with a controller in our hand, apparently
7250000	7252000	So there you have it
7252000	7254000	Alright, now for the long, long, long, long, long email
7254000	7256000	Actually, there's more of this, sorry
7256000	7258000	I think I'm just going to post the long email
7258000	7260000	On the forums again, sorry for the cop-out
7260000	7262000	My throat hurts
7262000	7264000	So I'll finish this one
7264000	7266000	Have you ever played any memorable games that are so incredibly bad
7266000	7268000	In a weird sort of way that ended up being good?
7268000	7270000	Yes
7270000	7272000	Driver 3
7272000	7274000	Driver 3 is the best, worst game ever
7274000	7276000	It's just so bad
7276000	7278000	In fact, I was talking with my sister yesterday
7278000	7280000	About that, and she's like, I gotta go back and play Driver 3 again
7280000	7284000	She would basically just play the game
7284000	7286000	Drive around, do like stupid shit
7286000	7288000	And then watch the replay
7288000	7290000	Because the best part about it
7290000	7292000	The game was so glitchy anyways
7292000	7294000	That the replays were funny
7294000	7296000	But sometimes the replays would even glitch out even more
7296000	7298000	So your character would do really crazy stuff
7298000	7300000	But yeah, Driver 3
7300000	7302000	Absolutely a horrible game
7302000	7304000	That's funny to play
7304000	7306000	That don't shit your pants game was pretty bad, but funny
7306000	7308000	That was the one I played on Flash
7308000	7310000	That was the one I played on Flash
7310000	7312000	Logie had mentioned last week
7312000	7314000	I don't know, I can't think of a lot of console games that I go
7314000	7316000	Wow, that game was bad
7316000	7318000	Bejeweled
7318000	7320000	But yeah, I love Bejeweled
7320000	7322000	But Bejeweled's not a bad game, it's a great casual
7322000	7324000	Well, no, it's like Tetris
7324000	7326000	It's like a puzzle game, it's not a bad game
7326000	7328000	Did you see that they're bringing Bejeweled Twist to DS?
7328000	7330000	Yeah, but I'll be more interested when Bejeweled Twist is free to play on the website
7330000	7332000	Like all the other games
7332000	7334000	Also, I will get Pagle on Xbox Live Arcade
7334000	7336000	When it comes out
7336000	7338000	Definitely, definitely
7338000	7340000	But right now it's all about Bejeweled Blitz on Facebook
7340000	7342000	But nobody else, I have the shitty team score
7342000	7344000	Because nobody else plays every week like me
7344000	7346000	But I try to get a new score every week
7346000	7348000	So
7348000	7350000	If you do play, you should add me on Facebook
7350000	7352000	Because I need a higher team score, so there you go
7352000	7354000	Well, um
7354000	7356000	The third part of this email
7356000	7358000	Yep
7358000	7360000	In your opinion, what are the odds of releasing Final Fantasy
7360000	7362000	11 for
7362000	7364000	one or more of the current gen systems
7364000	7366000	I know they're really big on re-releasing
7366000	7368000	the other Final Fantasy games
7368000	7370000	So are they re-releasing Final Fantasy 7
7370000	7372000	So re-releasing Final Fantasy 7 should be a no-brainer
7372000	7374000	Although not everyone
7374000	7376000	may agree on this
7376000	7378000	Final Fantasy 7 is possibly
7378000	7380000	the most popular, I think it meant
7380000	7382000	re-releasing Final Fantasy 7
7382000	7384000	Because I was gonna say, 11's already on 360
7384000	7386000	Final Fantasy 7 is probably the most popular
7386000	7388000	memorable game of the series
7388000	7390000	So re-releasing that game would seem like a virtual
7390000	7392000	license to print a shit ton of money
7392000	7394000	Who wouldn't want free money, you know
7394000	7396000	Well thanks for reading and answering this email
7396000	7398000	Sorry it's so long
7398000	7400000	Um
7400000	7402000	I'd play it
7402000	7404000	I'm kinda torn
7404000	7406000	Yes they should, but I'd rather they just freakin' finish
7406000	7408000	Final Fantasy 13, like I'm also interested
7408000	7410000	in some of the new directions that Final Fantasy
7410000	7412000	is going. I wish they would have released
7412000	7414000	Final Fantasy 12 on the Playstation 3
7414000	7416000	and not the PS2, because I never finished it on PS2
7416000	7418000	And I think if it had
7418000	7420000	been on the newer consoles, I would have
7420000	7422000	probably spent more time with it. I know that seems so
7422000	7424000	silly, but that's what it is
7424000	7426000	So
7426000	7428000	There you go, I don't know, Loki you think they ought to re-release 7?
7428000	7430000	No
7430000	7432000	It's a classic the way it is. I think they do need
7432000	7434000	to just put it out on the download thing already
7434000	7436000	on Playstation Network
7436000	7438000	That I think they need to do
7438000	7440000	Um, just wait until 13 comes out
7440000	7442000	they may do that
7442000	7444000	Yeah, I could see that
7444000	7446000	But then again, why wouldn't you at least do it a couple months
7446000	7448000	in advance so people can play through Final Fantasy 7
7448000	7450000	before 13 comes out?
7450000	7452000	Because it doesn't tie really
7452000	7454000	with each other, it's just a really
7454000	7456000	uber Final Fantasy game that
7456000	7458000	goes along with another uber Final Fantasy game
7458000	7460000	Well you know there is that whole, and GameGuru
7460000	7462000	says this in chat, hopefully if not a remake they put it on
7462000	7464000	PSN or Steam, kind of the same thing I'm thinking of
7464000	7466000	The last remnant of course we heard is coming
7466000	7468000	to Steam, which implies the whole Square
7468000	7470000	partnership with Steam now. Hopefully
7470000	7472000	they will release some of the old PC classics
7472000	7474000	on Steam, but we'll see
7474000	7476000	I don't know, I'm not going to hold my breath
7476000	7478000	Didn't Eidos
7478000	7480000	put them out? Didn't Eidos
7480000	7482000	do the ports for PC?
7482000	7484000	I could be wrong, I didn't play them
7484000	7486000	Slightly better
7486000	7488000	graphics, eh, I don't know
7488000	7490000	Not sure if I want to play these
7490000	7492000	Last email? Yes
7492000	7494000	This one's long. Alright
7494000	7496000	Dear Rob, Jamie, and Matt, I've been
7496000	7498000	a long time listener of your show and counted among my favorites
7498000	7500000	In fact, when you do miss
7500000	7502000	a show infrequently as it is
7502000	7504000	leaves me feeling out of place
7504000	7506000	as if I've gone to work wearing just one sock
7506000	7508000	Your unique mixture of news commentary
7508000	7510000	and charm are an important part of my week
7510000	7512000	This is my first letter to you, so I thought
7512000	7514000	I'd start out by thanking you all
7514000	7516000	thanking
7516000	7518000	you for all you've provided during the years
7518000	7520000	As an older gamer like yourselves
7520000	7522000	I'm not older, okay, I'm kidding
7522000	7524000	Maybe a little
7524000	7526000	I understand the difficulty in trying to balance work, family
7526000	7528000	and the passion we feel for our hobby
7528000	7530000	Add a weekly show with
7530000	7532000	pre and post production on top of that and I'm amazed
7532000	7534000	you've been at it for as long as you have
7534000	7536000	Anyway, enough of me gushing
7536000	7538000	So are we!
7538000	7540000	But no, thank you, that means a lot
7540000	7542000	Recently I came across a comment made by
7542000	7544000	John Kohler, head of Sony PSP hardware marketing
7544000	7546000	in North America, which suggested that
7546000	7548000	the majority of Nintendo DS's
7548000	7550000	are purchased
7550000	7552000	by or for 12 year olds
7552000	7554000	Obviously this was meant to insult the DS
7554000	7556000	handheld fan base
7556000	7558000	But that aside, how much of the
7558000	7560000	statement is true?
7560000	7562000	It's up for data on Nintendo demographics
7562000	7564000	as they break down by age group and have a hard time
7564000	7566000	finding any recent results
7566000	7568000	Most comments are anecdotal, with an equal number
7568000	7570000	of people saying they see
7570000	7572000	more PSP's to DS's
7572000	7574000	among their above
7574000	7576000	12 age group, as exist folks
7576000	7578000	insisting there are more DS's
7578000	7580000	in their circle. The closest I
7580000	7582000	came to anything was an article on
7582000	7584000	GayGamer.net
7584000	7586000	from 2007, reporting that
7586000	7588000	according to the NPD
7588000	7590000	Nintendo had increased their sales figure among women
7590000	7592000	by 42%, 127%
7592000	7594000	among people who age 30
7594000	7596000	and older, and 212%
7596000	7598000	among people 35 and older
7598000	7600000	I don't know if that's just for the
7600000	7602000	month of April or if it was since the last study
7602000	7604000	had been made. I know
7604000	7606000	maybe this really isn't that big of a
7606000	7608000	deal, but I'm curious to know if these
7608000	7610000	assertions have any factual base
7610000	7612000	Kohler's claim just doesn't seem right to me
7612000	7614000	I
7614000	7616000	completely disagree with Kohler
7616000	7618000	I think that, you know, I see
7618000	7620000	more people who have
7620000	7622000	DS's than they do
7622000	7624000	PSP's. Now I'm seeing
7624000	7626000	more guys in their
7626000	7628000	early 20's who have PSP's
7628000	7630000	that I will say, but
7630000	7632000	you get it 25 and up
7632000	7634000	you know, and you get kids and
7634000	7636000	all kinds of, I think more people
7636000	7638000	and more families
7638000	7640000	have a DS
7640000	7642000	that's how I see it, like
7642000	7644000	my brother and sister-in-law
7644000	7646000	Dan's brother and sister
7646000	7648000	they each have their own DS
7648000	7650000	so, I mean
7650000	7652000	now they're little, but then again
7652000	7654000	you know, my
7654000	7656000	you know, I know tons of people who
7656000	7658000	are my age, you know, back
7658000	7660000	you know, where I'm from, who all have
7660000	7662000	DS's, you've got
7662000	7664000	well, you don't have PSP DS
7664000	7666000	No, I own both. I bought a PSP when they first came out
7666000	7668000	Luminous. I was all about Luminous. I bought a
7668000	7670000	PSP just for Luminous, practically. But I know
7670000	7672000	that all of us in this room
7672000	7674000	own both
7674000	7676000	Dan and I each have our own DS
7676000	7678000	We're a little different too
7678000	7680000	We're crazy, but I would say you're right
7680000	7682000	I think generally, you see
7682000	7684000	the college boys probably have the PSP
7684000	7686000	and are using it, you know, as their multi-device
7686000	7688000	which is what the PSP does best, like MP3's and all that stuff
7688000	7690000	but, so like, if you were to look at
7690000	7692000	demographics, like different
7692000	7694000	demographics, I bet if you looked at the sales figures
7694000	7696000	like males age 18 to
7696000	7698000	24 who own a PSP and DS
7698000	7700000	it's probably a little closer
7700000	7702000	to even, I bet DS still outdoes it though
7702000	7704000	it's probably a lot closer to even
7704000	7706000	than any other demographic you look at
7706000	7708000	but when you look at things as a whole, especially
7708000	7710000	with the DS aggressively targeting women
7710000	7712000	the way it has been with the
7712000	7714000	lifetime commercials, Carrie Underwood
7714000	7716000	pink DS's, all this stuff
7716000	7718000	you know, and as much as you want to
7718000	7720000	point and laugh at these Imagine games
7720000	7722000	and the cats and all this stuff, it works
7722000	7724000	they're selling, or they wouldn't
7724000	7726000	make them, you know, they're
7726000	7728000	just selling to your little sister
7728000	7730000	or, you know what I mean, they're just not
7730000	7732000	selling to people that probably listen
7732000	7734000	to this show, if that makes sense
7734000	7736000	so, you know
7736000	7738000	it's working, but
7738000	7740000	the PSP does not have a lot
7740000	7742000	for that
7742000	7744000	same casual
7744000	7746000	I don't eat, live, sleep, breathe
7746000	7748000	games, but I like to enjoy a game once in a while
7748000	7750000	market, there's not a lot of
7750000	7752000	great puzzlers, casual games
7752000	7754000	outside of Luminous, the movie
7754000	7756000	thing didn't work out so well
7756000	7758000	so unless you have somebody that really wants
7758000	7760000	that all in one system, and I don't know
7760000	7762000	if you held up, like if I
7762000	7764000	were a parent, you know, who didn't know better
7764000	7766000	and you held up a PSP
7766000	7768000	and you held up a DS and said which is more
7768000	7770000	durable for my seven year old child
7770000	7772000	I would go with the DS because it
7772000	7774000	closes and it protects the screen, the PSP
7774000	7776000	just looks flimsier
7776000	7778000	that makes sense, and sometimes
7778000	7780000	it's little things like that
7780000	7782000	that sell the system
7782000	7784000	you'd be surprised
7784000	7786000	there's more
7786000	7788000	me
7788000	7790000	they actually said, I should add that I'm a DS
7790000	7792000	owner over 12
7792000	7794000	I do not own a PSP currently, but would
7794000	7796000	eagerly buy one should any of the rumors
7796000	7798000	regarding the PSP2 second analog stick
7798000	7800000	be realized
7800000	7802000	I own both a 360 and a PS3
7802000	7804000	and enjoy them equally
7804000	7806000	in an ideal world, all three companies will do well
7806000	7808000	and continue to provide quality entertainment for the gaming
7808000	7810000	public, so what do you think
7810000	7812000	in this comment just so much as Claptrap or is it
7812000	7814000	or is he right, and must all
7814000	7816000	adult DS owners hang their heads in
7816000	7818000	shame for being attached to a kiddie
7818000	7820000	system, I obviously say that in jest
7820000	7822000	as long as the games are fun
7822000	7824000	what does it really matter, how much fun can
7824000	7826000	we have even with a Speak and Spell bottle of vodka
7826000	7828000	and grown up vocabulary
7828000	7830000	hey, I'm not gonna say I
7830000	7832000	don't know
7832000	7834000	in closing
7834000	7836000	I want to add that I like the new site
7836000	7838000	design, it's been a long time coming
7838000	7840000	but it looks sweet and seems to load
7840000	7842000	faster than the old one
7842000	7844000	nice decision to keep the
7844000	7846000	orange background too, if I have a
7846000	7848000	complaint it's that the episodes on iTunes seem
7848000	7850000	to be a week or two off
7850000	7852000	last week's episode was from February 8th
7852000	7854000	does that mean that this week's show will be available March 16th
7854000	7856000	or later, no it's getting caught up
7856000	7858000	I was having some problems because now
7858000	7860000	when I do a podcast I have to do it in
7860000	7862000	two different places as opposed to before
7862000	7864000	so it was just confusing me a little bit
7864000	7866000	but I'm good now, I got
7866000	7868000	another one up today and another one
7868000	7870000	is edited and ready to go and then we'll be all caught up
7870000	7872000	so I'm excited
7872000	7874000	and I know I keep saying we're all gonna get caught up
7874000	7876000	but then the new site kind of threw that all out of whack
7876000	7878000	but it's a good thing, I mean overall
7878000	7880000	it's a great thing, so and we're
7880000	7882000	getting back on track
7882000	7884000	um, did I already
7884000	7886000	yeah, okay
7886000	7888000	well keep up the good work
7888000	7890000	in the meantime, loyal listener Raymond
7890000	7892000	PS, I too quit WoW after
7892000	7894000	two years, one level 80
7894000	7896000	two level 70s
7896000	7898000	I don't regret the time
7898000	7900000	I spent there but the opportunities are now open to me
7900000	7902000	to experience all
7902000	7904000	different kinds of gaming from Dragon Quest 5 to
7904000	7906000	Flower to Gears of War 2, it was liberating
7906000	7908000	and daunting, that's an interesting combination
7908000	7910000	so many new games
7910000	7912000	so many old games to catch up on
7912000	7914000	and only so many hours available in the day, I'm still
7914000	7916000	open to MMOs though, maybe one of the
7916000	7918000	superhero games or the Star Wars one will
7918000	7920000	entice me back, it all depends on the community
7920000	7922000	play Star Trek with us!
7922000	7924000	You know, um, that closing
7924000	7926000	statement is pretty much essentially
7926000	7928000	the reason, one of the big reasons why I
7928000	7930000	quit WoW right there, is that it's now
7930000	7932000	allowed me to play other games
7932000	7934000	you know what I mean?
7934000	7936000	Same type of deal dude, I probably would never
7936000	7938000	play Flower or some of these other games I've been playing
7938000	7940000	if I had a raid to do
7940000	7942000	tonight, you know what I mean? So
7942000	7944000	yep
7944000	7946000	I just don't want to be tied
7946000	7948000	to an MMO the way I'd be tied
7948000	7950000	to like, my job
7950000	7952000	exactly, exactly, and I don't think
7952000	7954000	you know, it's not like I was in one of those guilds
7954000	7956000	I was in a very very casual guild, but I was
7956000	7958000	I was being too aggressive with the raiding and stuff
7958000	7960000	and I just needed to cut back
7960000	7962000	you know, and just keep WoW as a casual game like
7962000	7964000	others, make WoW like
7964000	7966000	Bejeweled basically, alright
7966000	7968000	if you want to send an email, mailbag
7968000	7970000	at orangeloungeradio.com is the place
7970000	7972000	to do it, we're going to take your calls in
7972000	7974000	just a little bit, but first we have a few more
7974000	7976000	quick stories for you guys, and then we'll get
7976000	7978000	to the Skype line and
7978000	7980000	get towards closing out our show
7980000	7982000	for tonight, so Loki!
7982000	7984000	There is some new download content
7984000	7986000	for a rather old Command & Conquer
7986000	7988000	game, Command & Conquer Generals
7988000	7990000	is getting a brand
7990000	7992000	new download
7992000	7994000	pack, I guess it's
7994000	7996000	Black Sheep, The Lost Mission
7996000	7998000	and
7998000	8000000	it's
8000000	8002000	interesting that this game
8002000	8004000	you know, it's from like 2003
8004000	8006000	and they're doing some download content
8006000	8008000	for it now
8008000	8010000	didn't even know they were still
8010000	8012000	working on that game
8012000	8014000	might have been something that just wasn't quite done
8014000	8016000	and then they're just like, okay let's finish this
8016000	8018000	and go
8018000	8020000	but yeah, it's available to download now
8020000	8022000	very small download, so
8022000	8024000	check it out I guess
8024000	8026000	basically the mission, you're giving
8026000	8028000	I guess, given the command of a
8028000	8030000	toxin attractor
8030000	8032000	it's a modified farm vehicle
8032000	8034000	that sprays
8034000	8036000	icky green stuff
8036000	8038000	and you're
8038000	8040000	supposed to crop dust a town
8040000	8042000	that's been corrupted beyond salvation
8044000	8046000	huh, it's interesting
8046000	8048000	they're releasing download content for such an old game
8048000	8050000	though, but it's still popular, I mean, yeah, right
8050000	8052000	it's like Starcraft still getting patches
8052000	8054000	all these years later
8054000	8056000	well there's still a lot of people playing it, I don't know about
8056000	8058000	Command & Conquer Generals, but that's neat
8058000	8060000	you know what I have an odd urge
8060000	8062000	to play, like I was just feeling
8062000	8064000	this the other day, Diablo 2
8064000	8066000	like, I don't know why
8066000	8068000	but there's still people that hella play that game too
8068000	8070000	I just like, really want to play Diablo 2 for some reason
8070000	8072000	but I don't, I used to
8072000	8074000	have it a long, long time ago
8074000	8076000	but I can't find the CD
8076000	8078000	which sucks, because if I could
8078000	8080000	then I could enter in that code on Blizzard's website
8080000	8082000	or whatever now and just download it I think
8082000	8084000	ugh, oh well
8084000	8086000	anyhow, sorry Random
8086000	8088000	Final Fantasy was a game we were talking about a little bit
8088000	8090000	earlier ago, and you know what's kind of
8090000	8092000	funny, I think we were talking about this a lot when we were talking about
8092000	8094000	video games live as well, is that the whole Squeenix
8094000	8096000	likes to protect their stuff
8096000	8098000	and they don't want their images shown
8098000	8100000	well, they don't want folks to
8100000	8102000	knock off their Final Fantasy products either
8102000	8104000	apparently they filed a
8104000	8106000	federal lawsuit
8106000	8108000	against
8108000	8110000	Edgework Imports, Top Swords,
8110000	8112000	Wholesale Gallery, Pacific Solutions Marketing
8112000	8116000	$600,000 judgment
8116000	8118000	and they are no longer allowed to make
8118000	8120000	fake Final Fantasy goods
8120000	8122000	whether it be inside their own stores or doing it on
8122000	8124000	eBay and Amazon
8124000	8126000	the defendants altogether issued a joint
8126000	8128000	statement saying that they regret
8128000	8130000	that they have sold these copies to consumers
8130000	8132000	and they would have never imported
8132000	8134000	the stuff in the first place if they knew that Squeenix
8134000	8136000	would respond so aggressively to stop them
8136000	8138000	they will never make this mistake again
8138000	8140000	sorry
8140000	8142000	I bet you anything this Final Fantasy 13
8142000	8144000	poster we have in studio, you can probably barely see it
8144000	8146000	on Justin.tv, but right there where I'm pointing
8146000	8148000	it's behind the new penguins thing
8148000	8150000	that poster is a Final Fantasy 13
8150000	8152000	poster and I bet you anything
8152000	8154000	it's a bootleg
8154000	8156000	of course it's a bootleg
8156000	8158000	it's probably from one of these companies that just got the
8158000	8160000	$600,000 judgment
8160000	8162000	I like what darktatsuya says in chat
8162000	8164000	$600,000 judgment sounds like a game
8164000	8166000	might be like a new limit break in Final Fantasy 13
8166000	8168000	who knows
8168000	8170000	so if you are counterfeiting Final Fantasy
8170000	8172000	products and selling them for your own profit
8172000	8174000	you might want to stop
8174000	8178000	before you get the next Smackdown
8178000	8180000	so I don't know dark soccer are you forging any
8180000	8182000	Final Fantasy goods?
8182000	8183000	no
8183000	8185000	alright well then you have nothing to worry about
8185000	8187000	but how about another story?
8187000	8189000	well I could do that
8189000	8191000	Xbox Live Arcade Awards

8193000	8195000	so basically you can

8287000	8289000	vote for Res HD a lot but at the same
8289000	8291000	time I don't think our listeners should be
8291000	8293000	voting in this poll because you know why
8293000	8295000	and I have a right to say this because I'm looking at
8295000	8297000	the OLR March Madness thing going on
8297000	8299000	and apparently Tetris is currently beating
8299000	8301000	Super Metroid which is stupid
8301000	8303000	and I know this is happening mostly
8303000	8305000	in part to the whole debacle from last year
8305000	8307000	I knew this was going to happen people want their revenge
8307000	8309000	on me nah nah nah nah nah but you know what
8309000	8311000	if you're one of the people
8311000	8313000	that voted Tetris over Super Metroid
8313000	8315000	please do not vote in this poll because
8315000	8317000	you obviously don't know what you're talking about
8317000	8319000	dear people stop listening to
8319000	8321000	Rob the end
8321000	8323000	I thought I'd
8323000	8325000	say something controversial alright
8325000	8327000	couple more news stories and we're going to get your calls
8327000	8329000	on our skype line 1877 game
8329000	8331000	OLR
8331000	8333000	I got to vote for
8333000	8335000	Tetris now you're such an asshole
8335000	8337000	nah I'm just kidding I'm not
8337000	8339000	I am not voting for Tetris because
8339000	8341000	you know what as much as I like
8341000	8343000	Tetris Super Metroid
8343000	8345000	gets my vote
8345000	8347000	good job
8347000	8349000	Super Metroid pulls ahead
8349000	8351000	alright good job
8351000	8353000	high five Loki
8357000	8359000	alright anyhow
8359000	8361000	couple more news stories and we're going to wrap up tonight
8361000	8363000	Loki sorry
8363000	8365000	that's alright I understand
8365000	8367000	more Grand Theft Auto possibly
8367000	8369000	on the PSP apparently
8369000	8371000	Sony is in talks with Rockstar
8371000	8373000	they want some more games for their PSP system
8373000	8375000	and you know what I'm down with that
8375000	8377000	let's get some San Andreas stories going on
8377000	8379000	um
8379000	8381000	apparently they're interested to see how
8381000	8383000	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars does
8383000	8385000	um you know cause
8385000	8387000	for a while there you know they have
8387000	8389000	the exclusive rights to the
8389000	8391000	handheld stuff now
8391000	8393000	you know the DS getting its own version of
8393000	8395000	the you know Grand Theft Auto series
8395000	8397000	uh oh
8397000	8399000	so uh be interesting to see
8399000	8401000	I know both of the PSP titles were
8401000	8403000	you know best sellers on
8403000	8405000	the console so
8405000	8407000	be very interesting to see how
8407000	8409000	Chinatown Wars does
8409000	8411000	but be honest I mean the Chinatown Wars
8411000	8413000	stuff it's going to be good but it's
8413000	8415000	no PSP Grand Theft Auto games
8415000	8417000	those were you know just like the
8417000	8419000	PlayStation 2 ones and um
8419000	8421000	I hope they do another one
8421000	8423000	I really don't
8423000	8425000	but is Grand Theft Auto the type of thing you really want to play on your PSP
8425000	8427000	Loki I mean you're a Grand Theft Auto fan
8427000	8429000	we played the PSP version for months
8429000	8431000	the multiplayer was fun
8431000	8433000	and yes
8433000	8435000	it is something I would play on my PSP
8435000	8437000	for long hours
8437000	8439000	and it's also fun to hack
8439000	8441000	apart
8441000	8443000	for long hours I'd like to see a Saints Row
8443000	8445000	on PSP but no that
8445000	8447000	wouldn't happen or even like Crackdown on PSP
8447000	8449000	that'd be awesome anything sandbox-ish
8449000	8451000	hell Atari
8451000	8453000	or Ubisoft or whoever owns Driver
8453000	8455000	make another Driver game
8455000	8457000	you don't have to put any effort into it
8457000	8459000	just make another Driver game make it crap like the last one
8459000	8461000	make it very cr- well their last game
8461000	8463000	I didn't really play but make it like Driver 3
8463000	8465000	just reissue Driver 3
8465000	8467000	make no changes
8469000	8471000	alright and uh finally
8471000	8473000	tonight um this is
8473000	8475000	something interesting apparently a
8475000	8477000	60 year old woman
8477000	8479000	got held hostage at gunpoint
8479000	8481000	for 10 hours in Brazil
8481000	8483000	um this week this is reported from
8483000	8485000	globo.com apparently
8485000	8487000	broke this story but here's the part
8487000	8489000	that makes it interesting and somewhat game
8489000	8491000	related um the gun
8491000	8493000	that was used a Sega
8493000	8495000	light phaser from the old Sega
8495000	8497000	Master System of course
8497000	8499000	Sega is still a huge presence in Brazil
8499000	8501000	the Master System is still marketed in Brazil
8501000	8503000	that's right so uh you know no surprise that
8503000	8505000	uh the Sega light phaser
8505000	8507000	uh was the light gun of choice however
8507000	8509000	uh do try to hold somebody
8509000	8511000	up with a light gun
8511000	8513000	and they didn't figure out
8513000	8515000	that this was a fake looking gun
8515000	8517000	60 year old woman
8517000	8519000	uh the man did uh release the
8519000	8521000	hostage good for him negotiated
8521000	8523000	with police and uh
8523000	8525000	there you go so
8525000	8527000	I
8527000	8529000	don't know idiots like this uh anybody
8529000	8531000	that uses video game equipment to hold people
8531000	8533000	hostage deserves to have
8533000	8535000	the FUs of the week dedicated to them

8825000	8827000	about foodie monster I was eating
8827000	8829000	chips and drinking soda when you said

8833000	8835000	he's not and no one's made a comment
8835000	8837000	to twitter about it to him either
8837000	8839000	hopefully somebody will bring it to his attention
8839000	8841000	that he ought to listen to tonight's show
8841000	8843000	cause I'm sure I'll get a nasty twitter email about
8843000	8845000	it if
8845000	8847000	no one else does it I will
8847000	8849000	alright you get to it hey
8849000	8851000	no cons this weekend
8851000	8853000	um I'm done with the cons for
8853000	8855000	the month I did comic con I did
8855000	8857000	catacon I did wicked winter
8857000	8859000	ren fair I'm on break until the end
8859000	8861000	of March oh nice
8861000	8863000	long break for you
8863000	8865000	something like that have you speaking of cons
8865000	8867000	have you been to video games live it's like a mini
8867000	8869000	con not yet when it
8869000	8871000	came around my way I just didn't have the money
8871000	8873000	and to be perfectly honest I wasn't
8873000	8875000	really that interested at the time you know
8875000	8877000	I would say they do a costume contest
8877000	8879000	and there were only like three people
8879000	8881000	that dressed up so like if you did
8881000	8883000	your black luigi thing or heck any of your
8883000	8885000	video game related costumes I think you'd have a good
8885000	8887000	shot to win like a DS or something like that
8887000	8889000	I'll check that out you should
8889000	8891000	I bet you could do very well
8891000	8893000	yeah and speaking of like
8893000	8895000	conventions when you talked about the square enix
8895000	8897000	swords it would not be surprising
8897000	8899000	that I still see them at the conventions
8899000	8901000	or whatever's left the price would just
8901000	8903000	go double the triple for some odd
8903000	8905000	believe it or not they're cheaper than getting them
8905000	8907000	done commissioned by actual
8907000	8909000	prop makers probably
8909000	8911000	probably
8911000	8913000	is this true I see Breslull
8913000	8915000	in chat are saying you are going to sakura con
8915000	8917000	true or false no I'm not
8917000	8919000	oh
8919000	8921000	I kind of want to go to sakura con
8921000	8923000	I love seattle but I also want to go to packs
8923000	8925000	so I don't know and flights
8925000	8927000	aren't always necessarily
8927000	8929000	that cheap but I don't know I might be able
8929000	8931000	to come to sakura con
8931000	8933000	maybe if Breslull will let me
8933000	8935000	crash his place on the couch or something
8935000	8937000	as long as you don't violate
8937000	8939000	him in his sleep I promise
8939000	8941000	I'll be good
8941000	8943000	and um last week you guys
8943000	8945000	he can't violate me in my sleep why are you telling
8945000	8947000	me he needs to not violate me
8947000	8949000	he would
8949000	8951000	be the one to do that
8951000	8953000	gs68 says come to faname
8953000	8955000	dammit I'm almost positive I'll
8955000	8957000	be at faname this year in fact we need to talk about
8957000	8959000	orange launch radio panel I think that is happening
8959000	8961000	I don't know so we'll
8961000	8963000	figure it out
8963000	8965000	wow
8965000	8967000	um I want you guys to know that
8967000	8969000	you guys covered an article
8969000	8971000	last week that you covered
8971000	8973000	like 3 years ago
8973000	8975000	you know sometimes those oddities
8975000	8977000	happen but what was the article just for fun
8977000	8979000	final fantasy 10 port
8979000	8981000	on the nes
8981000	8983000	really that had come up before I thought it was
8983000	8985000	recent I remember there was a 7
8985000	8987000	port on the ds a few years ago
8987000	8989000	that final fantasy 7 but I didn't remember
8989000	8991000	a 10 port so that's why
8991000	8993000	it was a 10 because someone
8993000	8995000	posted I followed the link and I'm like
8995000	8997000	this is 10 yeah
8997000	8999000	interesting well it happens
8999000	9001000	whatever you know we're not
9001000	9003000	perfect and the show's been going a long
9003000	9005000	time we can't remember
9005000	9007000	every story we've ever done it's gonna happen
9007000	9009000	that's fine I mean I was
9009000	9011000	I had no problem with that that was pretty cool

9015000	9017000	years ago either thankfully we have some of the faithfuls

9031000	9033000	to talk about so we're gonna have to figure something out
9033000	9035000	that's not likely gonna happen I doubt

9097000	9099000	orange lounge radio apparently
9099000	9101000	super mario kart according to
9101000	9103000	guinness book of world records
9103000	9105000	has compiled the top 50 console
9105000	9107000	games of all time
9107000	9109000	and super mario kart apparently
9109000	9111000	has the longest legacy
9111000	9113000	and the biggest impact on video games
9113000	9115000	in all of history and that is according to again
9115000	9117000	the guinness book of world
9117000	9119000	records they need to get out of video games
9119000	9121000	number 2 tetris 3 grand theft
9121000	9123000	auto 4 super mario world
9123000	9125000	zelda green of time at number 5

9127000	9129000	50 it's like seriously guinness
9129000	9131000	no one gives a shit about your book anymore
9131000	9133000	hey i love guinness when it's booze
9133000	9135000	actually yes i give a shit about their book anymore
9135000	9137000	so sorry you're wrong
9137000	9139000	but even about video games?
9139000	9141000	yes actually
9141000	9143000	i think that it's fantastic that they're
9143000	9145000	still keeping track of all of this i think it's great
9145000	9147000	well i beg to differ
9147000	9149000	if they're still using twin galaxies to do it
9149000	9151000	but we'll save that another night
9151000	9153000	not using twin galaxies but i mean
9153000	9155000	but i still think that the
9155000	9157000	guinness book is fantastic
9157000	9159000	thanks for the call waiting on the line
9159000	9161000	hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
9161000	9163000	hi this is spazzinator
9163000	9165000	hi spazzinator what's on your mind
9165000	9167000	um two things
9167000	9169000	um i just want to say thank you to
9169000	9171000	loki for showing off
9171000	9173000	nobody boy last week
9173000	9175000	uh thanks to him
9175000	9177000	showing off the folders
9177000	9179000	i ended up buying the game
9179000	9181000	uh during the middle of the week
9181000	9183000	it's actually quite fun
9183000	9185000	so uh thank you to him
9185000	9187000	we did some mixed reviews on that
9187000	9189000	so i'm glad to hear you liked it after all
9189000	9191000	no problem we tried to do that now that we've got the
9191000	9193000	justin tv thing hooked up pretty cool where
9193000	9195000	you know even though i think watching
9195000	9197000	a radio show being taped is the most boring thing
9197000	9199000	in the world at least the audio now
9199000	9201000	goes out over justin tv really well
9201000	9203000	and um you know we do those little breaks
9203000	9205000	in between that seem to work out really well
9205000	9207000	for the audience over there so and it
9207000	9209000	you know it opens up our show to a new group of people
9209000	9211000	cause there's a whole vast
9211000	9213000	you know user base on justin tv
9213000	9215000	that would never think to seek out all games
9215000	9217000	dot com or orange lounge radio otherwise
9217000	9219000	so hey it works
9219000	9221000	and um
9221000	9223000	as far as the
9223000	9225000	second thing um i just wanted
9225000	9227000	to respond to that one email
9227000	9229000	that you read earlier today
9229000	9231000	i can't remember his name
9231000	9233000	but he was asking about
9233000	9235000	you know advice
9235000	9237000	regarding final fantasy
9237000	9239000	11 yeah
9239000	9241000	yeah basically
9241000	9243000	you know i agree with a lot
9243000	9245000	of your criticisms of
9245000	9247000	final fantasy 11 i know
9247000	9249000	the game is not perfect
9249000	9251000	by a long shot but still
9251000	9253000	it is pretty fun
9253000	9255000	um i've been playing for
9255000	9257000	just barely over 3 years now
9257000	9259000	um i would recommend
9259000	9261000	that this person
9261000	9263000	get into a good
9263000	9265000	link shell which is
9265000	9267000	you know the game is equivalent to a guild
9267000	9269000	um and there's
9269000	9271000	uh you know the game
9271000	9273000	is designed to be very social
9273000	9275000	um so even if
9275000	9277000	you're just sitting around waiting
9277000	9279000	to get into a party
9279000	9281000	you know you can always you know shoot the
9281000	9283000	breeze with your friends in the link shell
9283000	9285000	uh while waiting
9285000	9287000	spazzinator i think it's um
9287000	9289000	that's true about like almost any mmo
9289000	9291000	is that like if you ask people
9291000	9293000	why do you play this game so much like i would say
9293000	9295000	this about wow it's the people
9295000	9297000	the people and the community is always going to be
9297000	9299000	what brings you you know to the game
9299000	9301000	so you're absolutely right no matter what
9301000	9303000	mmo you're going to play if you play wow you
9303000	9305000	need a guild if you play 11
9305000	9307000	you need a link shell you know or the equivalent
9307000	9309000	of these things in other games here i'm going to
9309000	9311000	try to ask you a question here what
9311000	9313000	would you say is
9313000	9315000	the number one thing
9315000	9317000	that draws you to final fantasy 11
9317000	9319000	besides the people what is it about
9319000	9321000	final fantasy 11 the game that
9321000	9323000	keeps you coming back
9323000	9325000	well you know
9325000	9327000	i've been a
9327000	9329000	pretty big fan of the series
9329000	9331000	as a whole
9331000	9333000	for a number of years and i figured
9333000	9335000	you know at the time
9335000	9337000	you know this was the next one
9337000	9339000	in the series now get that started
9339000	9341000	uh not only that
9341000	9343000	but since i'm primarily a console
9343000	9345000	gamer now my
9345000	9347000	selection of
9347000	9349000	mmo's are kind of limited
9349000	9351000	uh the
9351000	9353000	only other one that i'm familiar with
9353000	9355000	and heard of is
9355000	9357000	the playstation 2
9357000	9359000	version of everquest
9359000	9361000	and that was alright
9361000	9363000	but in final
9363000	9365000	fantasy 11 in my opinion
9365000	9367000	is a whole lot better
9367000	9369000	um and
9369000	9371000	plus you know you can play as
9371000	9373000	a black mage you know which
9373000	9375000	both of my characters are
9375000	9377000	and it's just so
9377000	9379000	much fun nuking the shit out
9379000	9381000	uh the beastmen in
9381000	9383000	final fantasy 11 you know whether
9383000	9385000	you're casting fire or
9385000	9387000	arrow or
9387000	9389000	thunder or whatever
9389000	9391000	you know just like
9391000	9393000	uh doing you know
9393000	9395000	casually uh casting
9395000	9397000	spells you know every
9397000	9399000	2 or 3 seconds you know
9399000	9401000	alright
9401000	9403000	well you know um i can see that because
9403000	9405000	final fantasy 11 was kind of a console
9405000	9407000	game you know it was made for the playstation 2
9407000	9409000	i know a lot of people here in america play it on
9409000	9411000	pc but most people over in japan play it on playstation 2
9411000	9413000	and a lot of people here in america play
9413000	9415000	it on playstation 2 as well it is one of the few
9415000	9417000	mmos very accessible through a
9417000	9419000	console so you know i can kind of see that wow
9419000	9421000	wow is missing um a significant user
9421000	9423000	base from not having a version of it
9423000	9425000	on consoles but then again i couldn't see wow
9425000	9427000	on a console so i get it well spazzinator
9427000	9429000	we're gonna have to let you go so we can get some more calls but
9429000	9431000	um i hope your sales pitch works i'm sure it
9431000	9433000	will i'm sure he'll uh acidic vampire will at least
9433000	9435000	spend his one month in final fantasy 11
9435000	9437000	and hopefully he'll stay a little longer after that

9463000	9465000	everything i got a few new games
9465000	9467000	i got a few new features on
9467000	9469000	okay you're you're i i don't know if
9469000	9471000	something's weird with the audio we're
9471000	9473000	getting it's a little hard to understand
9473000	9475000	may i want to get a little bit away from your mic
9475000	9477000	i don't know what's up with that no that's all right
9477000	9479000	um so you have some new games you want to review what's up what games
9479000	9481000	um gta
9481000	9483000	uh liberty city
9483000	9485000	and tony arx project 8
9485000	9487000	well tell us about them
9487000	9489000	well where we see stories
9489000	9491000	first time playing it even though
9491000	9493000	i'm only 16
9493000	9495000	i've been on amazon my debit card
9495000	9497000	um basically
9497000	9499000	what i like is if we play
9499000	9501000	it just for all humans but a lot more
9501000	9503000	i like rolling
9503000	9505000	around in the tank blowing stuff up
9505000	9507000	blowing
9507000	9509000	blowing stuff up in games is always fun
9509000	9511000	plus
9511000	9513000	the custom soundtrack option even though it comes
9513000	9515000	up in your safe house as corrupted
9515000	9517000	which is
9517000	9519000	weird but uh you can put
9519000	9521000	except it's very complicated to
9521000	9523000	put them into tsc and then put them
9523000	9525000	to that gta
9525000	9527000	for your songs
9527000	9529000	it's kind of cool though
9529000	9531000	so what was the other game you played besides grand theft auto
9531000	9533000	tony arx project 8
9533000	9535000	tell us a little more about
9535000	9537000	this game i don't this one's not ringing a bell
9537000	9539000	for some reason
9539000	9541000	basically it's like
9541000	9543000	all your tony arx games but a little bit more
9543000	9545000	of a challenge um
9545000	9547000	basically you had to keep
9547000	9549000	pushing up to keep your
9549000	9551000	skater going there is no auto kick option
9551000	9553000	whatsoever in the game
9555000	9557000	what game is this
9557000	9559000	what game is this
9559000	9561000	tony arx project 8
9561000	9563000	ok yeah now i understand
9563000	9565000	ok cause like when it was coming through
9565000	9567000	was it just me i couldn't understand what he was saying before
9567000	9569000	ok now i get it
9569000	9571000	so um
9571000	9573000	ok so is this a game
9573000	9575000	worthy of the tony arx series or is it
9575000	9577000	you know kind of average or what
9577000	9579000	um
9579000	9581000	it's a little bit more challenging i will say
9581000	9583000	it's going to be more of a challenge
9583000	9585000	for me
9585000	9587000	what makes
9587000	9589000	this game
9589000	9591000	different from the other tony
9591000	9593000	arx games
9593000	9595000	like
9595000	9597000	basically um
9597000	9599000	more area to explore
9599000	9601000	it's like a free realm
9601000	9603000	um game kind of like
9603000	9605000	american wasteland which the psp
9605000	9607000	never got
9607000	9609000	um because the ds
9609000	9611000	got american wasteland but
9611000	9613000	the ds never got project 8
9613000	9615000	and uh actually there is
9615000	9617000	another game i got
9617000	9619000	rock revolution for ds
9621000	9623000	that must be uh
9623000	9625000	that must be
9625000	9627000	interesting rock revolution on the ds
9627000	9629000	i know we had a review on that a couple weeks ago
9629000	9631000	i think sauce reviewed it i'm still tempted
9631000	9633000	to get it for 20 bucks on 360
9633000	9635000	i'm like oh that's 20 dollars i could like
9635000	9637000	buy lunch
9637000	9639000	actually the uh ds version
9639000	9641000	has the singing in it
9641000	9643000	which the consoles are missing
9643000	9645000	that is so weird but of course
9645000	9647000	the ds has the built in microphone
9647000	9649000	yeah
9649000	9651000	even though here's my little problem
9651000	9653000	here was when i've been on the psp
9653000	9655000	i mean why didn't her
9655000	9657000	mics just go with what um
9657000	9659000	activision did
9659000	9661000	and basically redo
9661000	9663000	the guitar grip but to fit the USB
9663000	9665000	port in a clamp on
9665000	9667000	because that one made sense
9667000	9669000	for a guitar grip
9669000	9671000	hmm
9671000	9673000	could be
9673000	9675000	alright
9675000	9677000	well um we are going to
9677000	9679000	um go ahead and wrap up
9679000	9681000	and let you go but uh keep having fun with
9681000	9683000	the ds games

9747000	9749000	5 will be making its way
9749000	9751000	to stores at the same time as
9751000	9753000	the game by itself um
9753000	9755000	the system of course would be just like
9755000	9757000	your normal elite system except it's
9757000	9759000	going to be all red um
9759000	9761000	as well as there's going to be a red
9761000	9763000	uh controller to go along with it
9763000	9765000	you're going to get a
9765000	9767000	an exclusive resident evil 5 theme
9767000	9769000	and also a um

9773000	9775000	as well as of course a resident evil 5
9775000	9777000	all that for the
9777000	9779000	low low price of $399.99
9779000	9781000	or just the normal price of an elite system
9781000	9783000	so um
9783000	9785000	pretty good deal if you were looking to buy an elite
9785000	9787000	system
9789000	9791000	and um the other thing
9791000	9793000	um that's supposed to be worked on right
9793000	9795000	now is apparently it is expected to
9795000	9797000	sign a deal for doom 4
9797000	9799000	um later this year
9799000	9801000	however they don't know who the publishers
9801000	9803000	going to be yet but you better believe
9803000	9805000	that you're going to see a doom 4
9805000	9807000	I wouldn't be surprised if it was EA
9807000	9809000	but you know
9809000	9811000	I don't know
9811000	9813000	doom 3 was kind of eh it was alright
