Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
I have beef
Congratulations, hopefully you don't get equal eye or any of the mad cow disease or anything like that
No!
You do sound like an angry cow right there
How are you?
Beefy
Alright, say hello
Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki
Hello
Are you feeling beefy as well?
No
How are you feeling?
Cheesy
Cheesy, alright
I am feeling hungry
Sir Robert, are you the buns?
I guess so
You're listening to Cheeseburger Radio where you can have all the time
I have a cheese pizza because I haven't eaten anything all day long
All day long?
Yeah because I was busy, I woke up early because Nathan had to call me early to go to Fry's
And we were building a computer all day and I didn't have a chance to stop and eat something
So you didn't, you got rained out for your thing once again didn't you?
And next week and the week after next
Yeah, don't get me started on that
It's funny because it'll be clear all fucking week long and then Sunday
POUR!
You look at the weather next week, it's the same way except it's pouring all week
And then it has a break and then pouring some more on Sunday
At least it's not snowing here, on my Twitter today like all my friends on the east coast are like
OMG snow, OMG snow
It's snowing in Alabama
It's snowing like all over the southeast, what?
I have to tell you something else that's really cool, I had cheeseburgers for breakfast too
You had cheeseburgers today for breakfast?
Yes, my leftovers from Denny's last night because we stopped in Denny's on the way home
I want to say hello to of course our chatters, the always present fourth guests on the show
Over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
And we actually have a chatter named Cheeseburger who is very excited saying
Yay Cheeseburger Radio
We also like to broadcast the show on Justin TV which you can see as we're taping live on Sunday nights as well
Justin.tv.orangeloungeradio
Although people are supposed to be clipping parts of the show, making clips for us
Do it!
So I can put them on YouTube but there's like one clip
But I want to show this on Justin TV so I apologize it's going to be a horrible radio
But Darkshark talk about the donations you've made to the studio
Well first of all a little bit of background
Dan and I are doing Uber cleaning, this is like spring cleaning for the millennium
And we found a bunch of our old posters and wall scrolls and some of them are kind of smashed
But I don't think Rob cares about smashed posters on the wall
So I decided to donate a number of our posters that we were just going to get rid of
It's hard to see on the TV anyway
To the wall, not only that wall but the other wall and probably that wall too
And the ceiling maybe
Who knows we might be able to really decorate in here I'm sure our landlords will love that
But I wanted to show this one in particular because this is one of the coolest donations I think
And a lot of our long time fans are going to get a kick out of this
But tell them what I'm opening up right now
Rob is opening up a DDR second mix marquee
Which I have had for quite some time
And that's like an actual like used in a machine type thing
And if you put tacks in that thing I will shoot you
Alright then I can't put tacks in it
You can use sticky tacks
I'll figure something out but look at that there's even an official Konami seal there in the corner
That shows you it's the real deal
It means nothing
That one is though
I don't think they really pirated second mix though
No that one actually is a legit second mix marquee
So it's my baby it was going to go in the vault but now the vault is completely empty
I have the metal thing from the machine I don't remember the face plate or whatever
I never did use that for anything
But it's around somewhere
Bring it on over we'll put it in studio
But what would the listeners be most excited about that you're planning to do with some of your stuff
Dark Sakura?
Well I don't know yet it's not really official Rob
Oh sorry then I won't say anything else
Well I'll say something
Burn it on air
Yes we're going to burn some of it live on air
Well as I'm sure our listeners know Dan and I have a whole lot of shit
A lot of stuff really
And because we're going to be thinning out the collection some of it
I'm thinking that some of the neater things that we just won't be able to eBay or anything
I might make a big grab bag for who wants my shit
So if anyone is interested in that then quick quick vote in the chat room
Wire in or fire
Who wants my shit?
I hope fire wins
And like I'm talking like leftover stuff like Hello Kitty stationary from six years ago
Awesome
And Rudoni Kenshin stationary from eight years ago
Who wants Jamie's crap?
And like leftover wall scrolls and shit
I see a lot of Y's popping up in chat people want your shit
God you want my crap
Act deft I want your shit
Like old E3 swag you know just crap
The DJ Ronma S wants to know where's the whiteboard
The whiteboard is here it's down for repairs before we remodel the studio
I used it for a side project on Thursday and I need to clean it up
Rob used it for Big Brother
I did I used it for the Big Brother game
I was just guessing that's great
I actually did on my own personal JTV I don't know if I want to give out the link
I'll put it out in chat or something but on my own personal JTV channel
You can see the whiteboard being used earlier this week
There you go
For my online reality game addiction
Alright let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week
Actually we're going to start a little different tonight with How Was Your Gaming Week
We're going to do something a little different
I'm going to start because I can
But I want to talk about something that actually was both Dark Soccer and myself
We went to Video Games Live last night
Very unexpected
Kind of came up last minute that a friend of mine had some extra tickets
But boy did he have some good extra tickets
We got the front row
Well I didn't Dark Soccer did
And some of us were
I mean the venue was really nice
We went to the Fox Theater in Oakland
It was a pretty venue
I was taking pictures of the freaking architecture
Is it a new venue? I've never seen anything there before
They're remodeling it
Oh okay that makes sense
It's fairly old it's the Fox Theater in Oakland
On telegraph
Gotcha
Well um yeah
We went to Video Games Live
And you know we had Tommy on the show
Probably about what nine months ago Tommy Tallarico
The guy that you know is really the mastermind behind it
Long enough to have a baby
He talked for a long time
When he was on the show
But no we really got some insight as to what was going on
So we finally got to check it out
Because the show's been going for what three four years
I never had a chance to check it out
And Bobby reminded me
Bobby Black Wolf is the show that's on before us on All Games Radio
When we tape live
Bobby reminded me that I had been hazing Pong
As one of the selections for
Inclusion
In Video Games Live
And actually it works
The whole classic game medley thing
Was actually one of my favorite pieces they did
Because it did time the music very well
I had Ross Dunn in it
I in turn will stay um
You need to see it though Loki
It's like for five seconds it's not even that bad
I say that the Pong idea is stupid
It was fantastic
I know on the record scene it's retarded
And not fantastic in any way
You're just an asshole
No actually it was
It was good though the whole classic game medley was actually one of my favorite pieces that they did
It was a good way to start the show
I want my medley of Vectrex
You know the buzzing from the screen
Well they did have
Some really random stuff in there
Like they had this
Well I'm talking about some of the pieces
They did the interactive space invaders thing last night
That looked fun
They had a guy get up on stage and he would run to the left
And the ship would move left
And run to the right and the ship would move right
But you can tell it's just some dude in the back with a joystick
Moving it in the direction that the guy is running
Because there's huge massive lag
But no matter what he did the space invaders destroyed
The two world trade centers
Shut up
But he did
He didn't win because
Tommy was yelling shoot the sides you idiot
Not like that but he's yelling shoot the sides
And the guy didn't figure out how to do it
But I was thinking to myself
There's really not a lot of music in space invaders
It's literally three notes
That the orchestra is playing
Sorry four notes
That the orchestra is playing faster and faster
With one person assigned to be the UFO
Whatever the UFO would show up on screen
I think the chorus was singing with it though
Were they really?
I thought it was kind of cheesy
But it was cool
Video games live is a very
Unformal thing
I was comparing it to the Dear Friends concert
That Square puts on that I've also been to
Twice actually
The Dear Friends thing
That whole thing is more like
A night at the orchestra
Granted there's a little more clapping and cheering
And interactivity
But like in video games live
Tommy just comes right out and says
You just scream right along
You cheer for your favorite stuff
We just want everybody to have fun
So you can tell right off the bat
They're going for a totally different type of setup
Did anyone go whoa intermission
My favorite part
Was there? There was applause for the intermission
Because they had like a loading screen which was really funny
I know it was cool It was funny
I liked that they had before the show
And during the intermission they would have little
YouTubes like that Miss Pacman
For reals thing and some of these things would
Show up randomly during the
Usually dead parts and it was cool
Okay so I had a good time
It was like a mini convention and obviously a lot
Of the arrangements were beautiful
I forgot just how awesome the music is
In Civ 4 I'm so happy they included that
Piece because Civilization 4 was amazing
The singer was very nervous
The singer was very nervous
But he did a good job
He's got a gorgeous voice
Oh yeah the god of war
Not a series I've ever really been into
Her voice was impressive Amazing
Her voice was amazing
Metroid makes me want to play that game now
The Metroid thing gave me a huge fan boner
Obviously if you've listened to the show long enough
The minute Super Metroid
This is just the ending to Sonic 1
I'm going Sonic Avenger
They're just putting it up there to show the other games
Hush
They were just showing you the Mario thing
They showed like every Mario game in existence
You know what my favorite was Rob? What?
The Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross debut
Brand new World premiere we saw last night
Of the oft requested
Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross
Which to me was like Scars of Time
Plus a couple other things
Scars of Time is one of my favorite video game songs
Period so I was just fine with that
That was like the World of Warcraft heckling
There was a piece that was called
Ten Years of Warcraft
And the first guy
Gets up and goes FOR THE HORDE
And there's people ahhh
And then FOR THE ALLIANCE
Boo
Our area was booing, it was amazing
Ok, parts I didn't like
And Jamie disagrees with me on this
Here's the thing, when I say I didn't like it
This is like constructive criticism
Overall I thought the show was great
But if there's one thing I could've replaced
With something else, because he goes up there and he says
Hey we have like 60 things
We could choose from and it's really hard to pick 20
That we can do here tonight, so my suggestion
Lose the Guitar Hero Aerosmith
Thing because it didn't fit
To me, it did not fit with the rest of the night
And yes I understand Guitar Hero is a video game too
Blah blah blah, and yes we understand
Tommy Tallarico is related to
But, but
Here's the thing, I didn't go to
Video Games Live to hear Sweet Emotion
You know what I mean? Dude I sure did
It just was not
What I wanted to hear, it felt like
I could watch a dude play Guitar Hero any day of the week
On YouTube or any of that stuff
I just didn't, I didn't care for that
And then when I go online and see
Oh I could've heard Bioshock and instead
They gave me that, you know I just, I was a little disappointed
I understand they want to give more stuff away
Do another interactive cheer cheer cheer thing
But for me it didn't work, I didn't like it
I think the best thing to have done
With that would be to have brought the guy out
And said here, here's your prize
This is the dude that won, yay
Bye, and maybe
I would even go for like a
Music game tribute that does
Like Guitar Hero and Rock Band little pieces
Of the songs or something
You know maybe even incorporate some DDR
I don't know, they're gonna be cool, Space Channel 5
I, I
Okay, when they said that they were about to do
A tribute to the Sega game, was I the only one
That yelled out Space Channel 5?
We all knew it would be Sonic
Cause I, of course
We all knew it would be Sonic, but wouldn't it be amazing
If it was choo choo
It was Yuji Naka up there, and I love that I got to see
My musical hero twice
Koji Kondo
Oh yeah, he was up there on the big screen
Yuji Naka was like, okay I suck at English
So I'm just gonna say it in Japanese
And I'm like, I don't have to use the subtitles
But um, it was
I'll tell you what though, um
What I did, I had a fun time
With this part, was when he came out with
The guitar before the Chrono Trigger
Bit, and like
So what do you, so, you know, we're gonna hear
All of this, it's like, play some Skynyrd, man
And I was like, Freebird
Yeah, the minute he came out with his guitar, everybody started yelling
Freebird, he's like, I'm not gonna play
Freebird, and then after
The song was over, he says, okay, now I'm gonna play Freebird
So
Actually, there was, there was somebody in our
Section that called for Sweet
Emotion, that called for
Dream On, that was it
Really, see, somebody else knew, I guess
Black Wilson Chat right now and says, I've got the Video Games Live Chrono Trigger
Song up on YouTube, this is a good arrangement
Has it really hit YouTube already?
Dude, he said, get that on YouTube
Tonight
That's true
Now that's what I thought was great
Cameras were encouraged
Video taping was encouraged
It was fun
There's no stick up the ass, cause keep in mind
Every concert
Okay, here we go, we got a little bit
Yeah, this is from last night, this is from user
GBPMike has put up
Some of the arrangement
Yeah, this is from last night
And you can hear everybody cheering and yelling in the back
Let me skip ahead to some of the Scarra time piece
I felt really bad for the flute player
Yeah, the flute player botched a little bit
Missed a note, big time
Yeah, Scarra time is just a beautiful song
And to hear that done live was cool
So anyway, yeah, the flute player missed a note
I think even Martin Learned missed a note at one point
I heard the piano, I don't know if it was him on piano
I heard a bad piano note at one point
I was like, don't!
But you know, mistakes happen, I'm not gonna be that critical
That's just, that's, you know
It didn't ruin the night, come on
No it didn't
I am, it ruined the night completely
How dare they miss a note
I come for a perfect performance
It's a little different when you're the soloist
Yeah, it's tough, that's a lot of pressure
I doubt they have a lot of time to practice either
But you know, I've been there before
So I can't really say anything
The only other thing
It is an expensive asking price
The seats we had were 60 bucks
I imagine the seats up in the nosebleeds were a lot cheaper
That's a hard price to call in this economy
But you know, that is the price of a video game
You know, considering no doubt
Tickets are going for like 80 bucks right now
It's I guess what concert tickets are going for these days
But you know what, if you have the money
If you have the time
Check it out when it goes to your town
I wouldn't follow it around like a dead tour or anything like that
Or I don't think I'd drive like a huge distance to see it
But I would definitely make it a point to see it
When it comes to my town again
I might actually, you know
I want to see different shows
They just announced, if you go to their site
They just announced like 45 new tour dates
Or something like that
They are going to be playing a show
In LA on June 4th
During E3
So they love to do that
They love to kind of sync up with big nerd conventions
And things of that sort
WonderCon was this one
Yes
Act F asked did they play the Metal Gear Solid song
Yes they did
David Hayter doing intros
For each part
And Tommy Tallarico came out in the orange box
And he was hiding in the box that said orange on it
Lots of tour dates announced for Canada
If you're in Canada you're very happy right now
They're going to Saskatchewan
On May 11th, Alberta
Calgary 15th, 16th
Edmonton 18th
British Columbia, the 20th and 21st
All those dates in May
So they're doing a huge sweep of Canada in May
Like even Winnipeg in July as well
Singapore, they're going to be in Singapore
Romania
France in November later on this year
They'll be in Portland, Oregon for a couple of shows
In November
San Diego July 23rd
New York, Lewiston
July 31st, so they're going to be all over
Later this year
Alright
So that was our experience of Video Games Live
Otherwise as far as my gaming week goes personally
I didn't have a whole lot else to do with my week
That was new
Didn't play a lot of new stuff
Still the old standby favorites
But I'm definitely this week going back to playing some Civ 4
After remembering how awesome the music is this week
I was like, oh god I need to play this again
Especially with the video and everything
It makes you all warm and tingly
Like a video game fan
So Dark Sakura, anything else in your gaming week
Besides Video Game Live?
I actually, right before the show
When I was getting my slab of beef
With two crackers on either side
I was playing Raiden 2
And Marvel vs Capcom
And oh my god
I hate when an arcade machine is in such bad repair
Oh god
I was using the dragon though in Raiden 2
That was pretty fun
I was just going to say
Speaking of arcade machines
This is going to seem completely random
But I saw a news story on this this week
Did you hear about that they're auctioning off all the arcade games
That they had at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch
They're going to try to sell all these games
The dude had a hip hop mania
Or the machine
He had a Sega 360
He had one of those two, he had a lot of different types of machines
But he actually had a hip hop mania cabinet
I kind of want it
Like the starting price I think was only like 400 to 600 dollars
I'm thinking about putting a bid on it
Just for fun
Dude, wouldn't it be awesome to have a freaking hip hop mania cabinet in here
That was like once owned by Michael Jackson
That would be kind of funny
Dude, that is not auctioning off his moon walker
I don't know why
But I think that's one of those random awesome things
Dude, he had a jumbo safari machine
Well keep in mind
Who is his biggest
Video game buddy
Oh Sega
Absolutely
He was in Space Channel 5 part 2
Shut up Loki
I said video game buddy
What? He played video games with him
Macaulay Culkin is not a video game company
We said buddy
You did not specify
Tigerclaw says I wonder did Michael Jackson even play those games
Probably not
Well maybe a couple of them
But who knows
I doubt he played them all
But it would still be kind of cool to own a machine that was once at Neverland Ranch
Come on, come on
Who doesn't want to own a piece of history like that
I think I'm seriously going to try to buy one of the machines
I can't spend a lot of money
But you know, I'll try to get something, why not
Alright
Because if you win that arcade machine you better check it with a black light
They had a hip hop mania machine local
Did they
It was a beat mania machine or something
I sent Jamie the link to it
On Twitter like a while ago
That poor
And it was about the same price
Interesting
Not from Golfland though
Not for sure, Roseville
Hip hop mania, it's got to be from Golfland
I swear to god though
If other Bamani fans out there try to outbid me on the hip hop mania machine
From Neverland Ranch
I will cut you
Jamie anything else
I can't say names right tonight
Anything else in your gaming week
Um
No
City of Heroes
My thing expired now
So I don't know if I'm going to play
And
Really stupid flash game
That I can't remember
Oh yeah, I played with my virtual pet on
Facebook today
I also want to say that was the worst no answer I've ever heard
What
Cause you said, I said is there anything else in your gaming week
You said no, but City of Heroes
And Facebook games
Oh
Rob
What
Loki how was your gaming week
Oh I didn't play anything
Except for, you know, Grand Theft Auto
Lost and Damned
You're a little feisty tonight Loki
I like this
No I'm getting over a cold actually
Again, it's like cold the sequel
You know I first got sick and then I got better
And then I got the flu
And then I got better
But now I'm coughing again
No so I was actually out sick
A couple days this week
Unfortunately I forgot to bring my 360 home with me
So I didn't play anything during that time
Um
But I did play Lost and Damned
Mostly this week
Really fun keeping me interested for a while
Until I finish the story mode
I also got to check out
A little bit of Eat Lead
The Return of Matt Hazard
And it's kind of cheesy
But I kind of like it
It's got achievements like crazy
For the most redundant stupid things ever
Like you start the game
And you get an achievement immediately
It's awesome
You pause the game and you get an achievement
Um
It's great
But then
The whole game is just very
Making fun of itself
And it's fun in that sense
I mean the game itself is not that great
They do have some really cool stuff that they did with the cover system
Like you can actually
Look ahead and find a piece of cover
And you hit a button and you'll actually
Sprint to that location which is pretty cool
And apparently the main character
Likes that cover system too
As he comments on it as you're playing the game
And he also complains about having to go through
A tutorial which is funny
Um
But yeah I haven't really gotten past the first stage yet
Because I literally started playing it about 20 minutes
Before I came over here
Um
But it's fun
And you can actually find it in stores now
Or at least some stores
Because Gamestop apparently
Broke street on it everywhere
Because they had it listed in their system
For the 26th of February
March 3rd
They just said ah fuck it we're not changing it in our system
And so they just left it out
At what stores put it out
But it will be coming out everywhere March 3rd
So look for it then
But um
Yeah that's pretty much it
And no DJ Dark Knight I'm not talking about Killzone
Because I didn't buy Killzone
And to be honest I'm actually gonna hold off on it
Because I still haven't even played through Resistance 2 yet
So there's no way I'm gonna
Start another game
You know well I am starting to eat lead
So I guess
I can't really see much there but I'm not buying another game
You know for the PS3 right now
One game at a time right
Yeah I wanna get through Resistance
You know Killzone I'm not too interested in
I never played the first one
The Resistance I've actually played you know the
The first game and went through the entire story line
So I actually kinda know what's going on
And I kinda wanna play the Resistance 2 all the way through
And then maybe play Resistance
Retribution when that comes out
Um
I might be getting a new car soon
One of the things I did this weekend was I went car shopping
Yeah it kept me away from video games for a little while
And the reason why I bring that up is that if I do end up getting a car
And have to factor in a car payment into my budget now
I'm probably gonna have to really cut back on the amount of new video games
I buy so I
I can definitely feel the pain of you know I don't have to get
Killzone 2 just cause it's new
No and seriously that is the thing too
It's like I kinda almost feel like peer pressure
Based on you know all the advertisements
And all the hype and stuff
And I look at it and it's like
You know it's just another shooter game
Do I really need to play this and no I don't
It's the same with like Star Ocean
I was gonna buy that and I'm like do I need to really play this right now
No I don't
And it's the more I keep evaluating stuff like that
The less I'm buying
Which is fine
You know cause there's gonna be
Eat Lead was one of those games that looked funny
And I wanna play it and I didn't really give a crap about
You know the production value
Or anything of the game cause
You know it's not an excellent
Game but it's fun
So that's why I decided to play that one
And then of course you know
I'm waiting for Mad World to come out
Because it's a lot of blood and
Killing which is gonna be so awesome
Act deft in chat jokes
Sky you're getting a Yaris? I'm considering it
It's not high up on my list anymore though
It was before but right now I'm
I'm torn between another Corolla and a Jetta
Rob if you get a Yaris the terrorists win
Hahahaha
And by terrorists I mean
People that made the Yaris game
Oh shut up
Anything else Loki in your gaming week?
I was actually
Also looking at
Hacking lost and damned
But I haven't gotten around to actually
Doing it
Yet but I've
Been looking at how I'm going
To do it
Unfolded Raptor in our chatroom chat
Says ask for the Yaris with a tentacle
They'll take me seriously
When I go into that dealership
Alright and if you want to join along with us here on this Sunday night
Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com
If you're not listening to us live on Sunday why not?
You got something better to do?
Alright maybe you do and that's why we put it out as a podcast
But check it out Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com
Live on Sunday nights when we tape at AllGames.com
I also wanted to
Show us your tweets segment
You guys sometimes
Respond to our Twitter requests
At username O-L-R on Twitter
And just before the show I asked
Hey Twitter when and if
VideoGamesLive comes to your town what do you hope
They'll play? Because you know I think there was
Probably a song we wish they would have done
But they didn't do last night
For example I kind of secretly hope
The new song was like Kid Icarus
That would have been pretty rad
Is there something you were hoping for?
I would love to hear the Wild Arms intro
That's a really good piece of music
So some of the chatters showed us their tweets
Earlier on Twitter
D2 says the Guardian Legend of course
And I Love Pancakes
DJ Ratchet says I would want them to play
Either Passion by Utada Hikaru
Or the legendary theme for Guitar Man
Even though I don't think that one would work
And you know they do
Simple and Clean obviously
I think they do that one every show with the Disney montage
But I wouldn't mind
A little Kingdom Hearts 2 or a little bit of both
Who knows
Act Def says when they came to Mexicali I hope they would play
A Kirby song, sadly they didn't
A Kirby plus Orchestra equals awesome
Crows says they're coming to Houston
Late 2009, I want to hear a crapload
Of Ace Combat 5 songs and the main
Theme of Fallout 3
Ooh that makes me think Bethesda, Oblivion
Oblivion would be an awesome one here
Peeger Uno says
The Let's Tap theme tune
And Harry AKA says
Some of the beautiful music from Braid
That's not a bad suggestion either
Braid had a very kind of ambient soundtrack
That might be pretty awesome to hear live
And since they're always adding new stuff
Kind of shuffling it up, keeping it fresh
Who knows what's going to come to that in the future
Show us your tweets
By following us on Twitter username
O-L-R, you know what
I was going to mention
Something that I was going to play this week
But I didn't get a chance to and I really
Really sad
Oh I also played more Nobby Nobby Boy
And I still don't get any
What's going on with that
I might add that the Destructoid review of it
Is hilarious
And I couldn't stop laughing for the dumbest reason
They had this song
That was in the background
I don't even know what it's called
But something about wanting to smell your dick
Or something like that
You gotta watch it
It's just like the weirdest thing
But that song in the background
I was laughing for like 15 minutes afterwards
I'm like what the hell was that
Anyways, so completely off of that
LittleBigPlanet
They had a group
Of seven different creators
Actually go through
And create all
Eight stages
Of Contra
In LittleBigPlanet
I've played the first one before
It's fun, it's fun
It's a good translation
Yeah so they have all of them including
Levels where you're inside the bases
And stuff and it's in that same perspective
And everything
Pretty awesome, so definitely go check those out
I'm planning on downloading them all
But uh
Yeah that's it, and hopefully
I'm hoping that this whole
Hacking lost and damned thing works
To have some more funny videos
Coming out
It's funny if you break open
The lost and damned
Download content
It's actually in the exact same
Format as the PC
Version as far as the files that are in there
So
In theory you could edit it just like
The PC version and do all sorts of
Crazy shit, so I'm looking
Forward to trying that out
Interesting, by the way I'm going back and forth
A little bit in chat, apparently
According to our
Old buddy Bobby
There will never be Oblivion or
Prey or Guild Wars music heard
At Video Games Live
And apparently there's some type of feud going on
Between Jeremy Sule
The guy who does the music for all those
Games I just mentioned, and Tommy Tallarico
Like there's a big
Gamer composer feud going on
There or something, I don't know
Can't we all just get along
Yeah, never say never
Money talks
Things that we thought would never happen
Have happened
Whoever thought we would boot up our Nintendo
GameCube and see a Sega logo
Right?
Whoever thought there would have been a Marvel DC
crossover
That was old
Anyhow, other housekeeping this week
I don't really have a whole lot
Of housekeeping this week
I did housekeeping
Just continue to support us on the web
Again if you've not visited the new
Orangelaunchradio.com you need to
Check it out, DarkSakura uploaded some of the pictures
She took from Video Games Live actually
I uploaded the one to the main page there
Of the marquee, but if you go into
The OL Army picks on the gallery
You can actually upload your own pictures
And DarkSakura actually uploaded
Some things to the gallery
Including a picture of herself
Taken earlier today it looks like
Oh my god!
A wild Jamie approaches
Use your pester ball
And then some cool pictures from Video Games Live
I love my picture of Master Chief
Some of these came out great, you should send those to Tommy
I bet he'd get a kick out of that
Some of these are a little blurry, but that one and that one
Are really good, you should send those in
I took them with my iPhone
For iPhone pictures it's not bad
Somebody apparently uploaded a thing that says
Rob is officially gayer than Christmas
Rob versus Chris, you'll just have to
Check it out
No, I bet anything it was Travis and John
Last night on Understation Live
This just seems like something they'd do
This reeks of
John and Travis somehow
Like, hey, how can we fuck
With the new Orangelaunchradio.com, I know
Let's make a Rob is gay joke
Ah, see, isn't it fun
Being friends with them for so long
I know, I know, those little bastards
Alright, but I love them
In a totally homosexual way
Alright, let's get to some
Gaming news, low-key
Well, you may remember last week, Capcom was teasing
Something that they were going to announce
On Monday, well, that announcement
Was Lost Planet 2
And Lost Planet 2
Looks very epic, very cold
Still, yet strangely enough
Like in a jungle
It's a frozen jungle
But they have a bunch of other cool stuff
It looks pretty sweet
Right now
Only announced for the 360
And so it's
Possibly going to be a 360
Exclusive, at least for a while
But, you know, the first game was that way too
So, who knows
And then some other cool stuff
They're going to have 4 player online co-op
Which is pretty neat
And, I don't know, I think the game looks really cool
Different environments
They even have some sort of mech thing
Because before you can get the mech suits
Well, now these mech suits can get into a bigger mech suit
That's like
Voltron-esque
So, that looked kind of neat
But, very exciting
But, no word on when this is planning on
Being put out, but I'm sure we'll hear more about it
During E3
Well, I suppose that's a slight more surprise
Than Dead Rising 2, which is what we predicted
On last week's show would be the announcement
But at the same time, Lost Planet 2
Should not be that big of a surprise
Yeah, especially when you consider that
They have the Lost Planet movie
That they're pouring billions and billions of dollars into
And, you know
So
I guess that's not too big of a surprise
I was going to chat
By the way, Travis says it was not us
That did the Rob is Gator than Christmas picture
So, that was just forever a mystery
And now he's also saying Under Station Live
What if it was Fart Princess?
It could have been
Now he's also saying Under Station Live is coming to an end
And I'm just like, huh?
So, I want more information
On what this is all about
I'm going to call you later, Travis
You better call in later, Travis
I want details, what the hell is going on?
Alright, anyhow, back to video games for now
Assassin's Creed on the PSP
A lot of announcements coming out of Sony camp
This week about the PSP
One of their destination Playstation events
Assassin's Creed is going to be coming
To the PSP
Ubisoft will be putting it out on the
Sony portable system a little later this year
Apparently there's also going to be
An Assassin's Creed bundle coming out as well
With, you know, a PSP with it
So
There you go, Assassin's Creed coming out
A little later this year for you fans of that game
And also for fans of
Having games on the PSP
So there you go
In other news
Speaking of PSP stuff
Um
You know there's actually something
About LittleBigPlanet
It's going to be on PSP
Because I said so
And because apparently Sony says so too
And it's going to be sometime
Before the end of the year
That it is in conjunction with
Media Molecule and it's supposed to be
Very much like the PS3 version
Where you can
You know, make your levels
And share them and play the game
And play everybody else's crap
But just take it with you
You know what I think
I think that it's going to be
You would download everything
Through the Playstation
Like you do
Through the PS3 like you do now
With whatever link to the
PSP
I think that this is one of the biggest
Does to come out of the Playstation event
I mean LittleBigPlanet's been
You know, a huge new IP for them
Although I don't know how well it's been selling here in the US
But I think it's been doing much better overseas
But you know, I think this is no surprise
At all that they're putting a port of this
On the PSP, we had rumors about this a few months ago
No surprise here
I guess I am surprised though that Media Molecule's
Not doing it themselves, that's kind of
Interesting
I'm not surprised because they're busy doing like
You know, expansions and stuff
For the main game
Someone else port it, that's fine
As long as it turns out alright
I was going to say also that
You know, I think it's pretty cool
That they're actually taking the PSP
Seriously this year
You know, putting out some pretty strong games
Because remember last year and stuff
They're all like, oh that's the year of the PSP
And then nothing really came out
Other than the Crysis core
Or a new PSP, a new design
What baby do, but you know
I don't know, I think it's kind of cool
Something else that's going to be coming to the PSP
Another PS3 franchise there
Motorstorm Arctic Edge
Which is of course
Going to be more
Arctic themed
Than the other games that are going to add
Snowmobiles as well
You can expect all sorts of stuff
Including some of the stuff that they
Showed off in their pre-rendered
Intro video that they kind of do
No gameplay footage is actually shown
But you know, stuff like
Maybe interactive environments including
Avalanches, collapsing
Snowbridges, you name it
And of course always some
Poor sap falling off of a dirt bike
And getting hit by some giant
Vehicle
The game will also be
Ported to the PlayStation 2
As well, so
Because they tend to port a lot of those PSP
Games to the PS2 and vice versa
Makes sense
They're still cranking out PS2 games
Still selling well, so
Why not?
I guess the price is right
And it's probably pretty easy for them to port stuff like that to the PS2
Might as well, I mean
Get some more sales that way
Alright, well if none of those
Games sounded interesting to you at all
Maybe this is a little more up your alley
A new Hannah Montana
PSP bundle
Oh joy! That's right, this is coming out in
July, it's going to be a PSP in a
Brand new color called Lilac
Imagine if babies
Shit purple, and that's the color
Of this PSP, that's pretty much the best
Way to describe it, it will come with
A new Hannah Montana rhythm game
I wonder if this is the same game that
Did somebody let Footy Monster know
That this is coming out, because he's a big fan of the
Hannah Montana music games
But also it's coming out
With a UMD of episodes
From Hannah Montana, also a
Two gigabyte memory stick coming with it
And, and, and
Stickers to decorate your
PSP with Hannah Montana
So there you go
Apparently some also
Casual other things coming to the
PSP, Ubisoft has
His Pets series coming to the PSP
Pets Saddle Club
Being one of the first releases in September
Obviously this is happening
To compete with the DS a little bit
Because they have the whole Carrie Underwood
Playing a pink DS commercial
So Sony has
Now tapped into Hannah Montana, which is
You know what, lover or hater
It's a huge brand for
You know, tween girls, so
I guess this is the way to go, right
To try and sell some of these at Christmas time
That they've tapped Hannah Montana
Shh, isn't that illegal
You know what I mean, you ass
La la la la la la
Exactly, so
I don't know though, I
Kind of want a baby shit purple
PSP because I don't think anybody else would have
One, it is an interesting
Color, but I want one of the blue ones more
I think, I'll get the Madden pack
That came with the blue PSP
Even though I have a perfectly fine and
Functioning PSP right now
I kind of want the lilac one, but not bad enough to go for
Hannah Montana
I'm also just kind of like
You know the PSP 2 announcements coming
Probably at E3, so if I can at least
Make myself wait until E3 to upgrade
My PSP, then I'll have motivation
To just wait even longer until PSP 2 comes out
I think there will be something
There will be another revision
From what I heard, it was supposed to be even
Slimmer with a sliding screen, but that's
About it, I mean
It's still best to be the same thing
Eh, whatever, who cares, it's not going to help
GioVedea in chat says
Tap ass and Hannah Montana
Should not be said in the same sentence
I apologize to any listener that was offended
Alright
Enough Hannah Montana, please
DarkSakura, help us change the subject
How about release dates?
Well we've got quite a bit for the UK
And I'm going to go on and go through next Sunday
Since it will already be after that
By the time they get this
So on March 4th, we have
Empire Total War
That's for PC
On the 6th, Battle Fantasia
There's also
New Play Control, Mario Power Tennis
Patapon 2
Tenchu, Shadow Assassins
Tom Clancy's Hawks
Watchmen, The End is Nigh
That's for PC, Xbox 360
And Playstation 3
And Flock for Xbox 360
The Playstation 3 version
Says it's out on the 9th
Yeah those are the
Live arcade games
Or Playstation Network games
Is that it?
Does it
Well in the US, there's actually quite a bit
Coming out this week
Lots of stuff, including
The big title, Halo Wars
Coming out on Xbox 360
On
PSP, we're getting
Phantasy Star Portable
Which is the remake of the Ambition of the
Illuminus expansion
We've also got MLB
Both O9
And 2K9
O9 of course coming out on all Sony
Platforms and 2K9
Coming out on pretty much everything but the
DS
version is getting MLB
2K9
Phantasy All Stars
Which is a weird looking game
But whatever
Empire Total War coming out on
PC
Also that week
We've got SBK Superbike World
Championship coming out on
PS3, Xbox 360
And Wii and Playstation 2
I believe
Also
Tom Clancy's Hawks
On Xbox 360
And on PS3
Wii Ski and Snowboard
On the Nintendo Wii
Kind of a sequel to that
Wii Ski game that came out last year
Also
Coming out
As well
Littlest Pet Shop Spring
Cause there's just not enough of those games
King of Fighters 98
Ultimate Match coming out on
Playstation 2
Little retro fighting action there
And then Spongebob vs.
The Big One Beach Party Cook Off
Your Spongebob themed Cookie Mama
Game
Sonic and the Black Knight
On the Wii
And
Finally
Sad
Thing to end on but Grey's Anatomy
Coming out on PC
DS and the Wii
I'm very curious to see
How that game performs
Because it's either going to start a trend
Of all these like you know
Interesting drama
It's not going to do well
I can tell you right now
They're putting it out for a reason right?
Yeah because they bought the license rates
These people put out weird stuff
Look at for example
On the DS there's a company bringing out
A Johnny Bravo game
Seriously?
A Johnny Bravo game now?
I bet that will outsell Grey's Anatomy
Yes it probably would actually
Alright let's head over to Japan
And look at some of the release dates in Japan
Because of course the types of things they get in Japan
Usually come out here a little later
Or around the same time as is the case of
Biohazard 5 is coming out on March 5th in Japan
Of course Biohazard is the Japanese name for
Anybody?
Anybody?
Your mom!
PlayStation 3
Also getting Biohazard 5
Which seems to be dominating the week over there this week
But don't count out
MLB 09 the show
And Senju no Valkyria
Is getting a price reduction as well
Which is just you know
Valkyria Chronicles over here in the US
On the Nintendo Wii
On March 5th
Only one big release is
Relaxuma
Mina de Goryuri
Sekkatsu is coming out
Which looks like a game with cute little animals
Um
There's no screenshots
Just cute little finger painted
Survivor horror game
Somehow I doubt it
I'm sorry to say
PlayStation 2 has Galaxy Angel 2
Coming out as well as Need for Speed
Pro Street and Sengokushi
X gets a price
Reduction as it moves into
A greatest hits type series over there
Nintendo DS 7th Dragon
Is a big release over there this week
That is a game coming from Sega
That's an RPG
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS
Kimo Koei
And Simple DS
Volume 47 because every week
It seems like over there there's another Simple DS game
Coming out
Lastly on the PSP
It looks like there's
They're getting the 3000
In blue this week in Japan
And red
And a lot of matching
Gear coming out to match that
Otherwise Mina no Golf
Portable which is just Hotshots Golf
Is getting a price reduction
There you go, not a lot of huge stuff in Japan this week
Since you have Resident Evil 5
New colors that they have for the DSI
Just the black and the
Crappy blue
No they have the new colors for
Japan
They have this weird
Not even maroon it's like a
Pinkish
Purple
Magenta color system
They got this weird lime green
And a dark blue
It's probably better than the colors here
That light blue is terrible
I don't want a DSI in that color
Well I don't really want a DSI anyway
I'm not sold on it yet
Me neither
Maybe when some of the DSI games start coming out
I hardly ever play handhelds unless I'm like
Embed sick or something you know
I'm just not a big handheld fan
It's when you have the flu
It's the flu system
It's the DS flu
Well how about some WiiWare stuff
Yeah give me a reason to turn on the Wii
Well you can get beer pong
Frat party games
You have a
Your table set up with
Four people
Up to four people playing
And you have to throw ping pong balls into a paper cup
Now is this story coming out of Europe
Because I would think, I thought we got that game
A while ago. Yeah this is Europe
Yeah I thought we had, but they had to change
It to like party toss or what did they call it
Pong toss
So they're actually getting beer pong over there
They're getting beer pong frat party games
I'm glad to hear their feathers aren't so ruffled over there
And they're getting speed pong
Where you use power ups
To slow your other people down
There's also snowboard riot
Where
You go down and you
Attack people and defend yourself
With your snowboard?
I guess. Or you riot in LA with a snowboard
That sounds like it could be kind of fun actually
It seems like road rash with a snowboard
That might be alright
So, anyway
The beer pong is 800 Wii points
Snowboard riot is 1000
And
I guess speed pong would also be 800
I suppose
And spoiler alert, beer pong's not worth it
For 800 points there
Dammit!
I was wanting to play it for myself
And find that out, Loki
Jerk
Seriously, you can buy cups and a ping pong ball
For cheaper
And you can get drunk
But only if you're 21 or over, please
I was gonna say
I don't know if you noticed, this week actually
Was the first week that they started offering
I guess over here, I thought they were available
Over here already, but
I thought we mentioned 64 games on the virtual console
I thought we mentioned it last week's show
I don't remember, maybe we didn't
Because I remember getting into a conversation about
No, I guess not, if they just came out on Monday
I guess we wouldn't have brought it up yet
Yeah, no, I saw that they were there
I haven't downloaded any yet
Because I'm still on my stupid little
I'm not downloading anything else kit
Well seriously, what, they announced a solution how long ago now?
And
Here's the thing, well
There is one thing that will break it
When the whole mission comes out, I have to get it
I have to
Because I loved that game on the Commodore 64
So that'll be the thing that gets me to break
But that didn't come out yet
So we'll see
I never agreed to do it
Well if I conveniently forget to turn on the Nintendo Wii 2
I probably won't even remember to download it
And if I just stay away from blog sites on Monday
I won't ever hear it's out
But now that I said that, I'll get a million emails
From listeners saying, hey Rob
Did you break your thing yet?
Well the whole mission came out today
Jerk
Seriously though, when are they gonna, they're probably gonna make this big announcement
At E3, it's like, yes
We're gonna have a storage solution
You know, we totally never announced this before
At Christmas, or you're gonna have to buy this new system to get it
Yeah, you're gonna have to buy, yeah
Ugh
Hate them
Hate them all
I love Nintendo
Because we have Choaniki
Whatever
So
There's this new game
That's kind of exciting
I guess
Since it does have Excite in the name
Excitebots Trick Racing
It's coming out on the Nintendo Wii
April 20th
And no one seems to know
What it is
It's so crazy
What exactly is ExciteTruck
Or ExciteBots
It is being made by the people that did ExciteTruck
And the ExciteBike
Or franchises
I've never heard this game, this is completely
No, this is, I've never, this is a shock
Completely new news to me
Complete utter shock to me
Okay, no, really, I have heard about this
And it's funny that no one seems to know
What the game is about
And
Probably better that they don't
I mean
Surely it wouldn't be something as stupid as like
The bots battle each other or something
Like it's a racing like robot
Thing where they actually like a
Mech thing, it wouldn't be that stupid would it
Yeah
It wouldn't be like, you know, that they took
This awesome racing game
And said, hey you know what would be awesome instead
Of making a, I don't know, a sequel to it
And just not really changing anything
But adding some more tracks
How about we just take the whole game, take a shit
On it and turn it into a party game
Ha ha
And then we have ExciteBots
No, they wouldn't do anything like that at all
Oh god, I hope not, in fact
It would be crazy like, you know, they could have
A weird synopsis for it or something
Um, just trying to think of what exactly
We would say
Ha ha
Um, I don't know
Um, make something up
Try to make up what a possible synopsis
For ExciteBots
Might read
ExciteBots, um, let me think here
Um
Um
Uh, let's see
If I were to guess
An ExciteBots
Trick racing synopsis
I would say that ExciteBots
Trick racing takes the big air thrills
And simple controls of ExciteTruck
And ramps up the fun with a non-stop
Barrage of funky challenges and minigames
Performed at a blinding speed
You won't believe your eyes when you find yourself
Shooting goals, throwing pies
Even playing poker in the middle of racing
Robotic animals, insects
Around off-road tracks
God damn, Loki
You are one hell of an improv artist
I know, it's so crazy
How poetic in your description
And I also might say that it would support two to six players
Over Wi-Fi
Why can't you be that eloquent normally?
I just don't have it in me
You just got excited about it
You're just too full of cheese
Sadly enough, I do want to play this game
I'm scared
That they fucked this up
And it's like
I've been waiting so long for an ExciteTruck
Sequel
And I know they fucked this up
It's like, you can't fuck this up
You just do the same thing, put out the same damn game
Just change the tracks, add different cars
You don't have to do anything
It's sold okay
But I know they fucked this up
And it's really scaring me
So I'm loading up this
To read this comment in chat
Um
X-Link says Excitebox
It will make you shit your pants
Which, by the way, this is a game I played a ton of this week
That Flash game
Don't shit your pants
That's my favorite
New little sound I've heard in a Flash game
Just Google it if you have no idea what I'm talking about
Um
Anyhow
Comments from chat, I'm sorry
No more comments from chat
Tigerclass says why can't they do a sequel to ExciteBike
ExciteBike
Not ExciteTruck, but ExciteBike
Um, they could do that
ExciteTruck with ExciteBikes in there
Oh my god, look at that
It's expanding on the franchise
Do it like MotorStorm, I mean come on
Oh no
People that play the Wii don't want to actually play a real game
They want to play another fucking party game
Because where will they get party games on the way
They're just not available
GS68 suggests ExcitePants
Mix the magic of ExciteTruck with the
Suspense of don't shit your pants
The game and you have ExcitePants
I'm, I'm, let me put it this way
We have a toilet at one end of the course
I'm still gonna play this game
I'm still gonna try it out
I'm just, the description so far
And the fact that I haven't seen any
Screenshots
Or know anything about it
It kind of scares me right now
But I don't understand how playing poker
And driving really fast
Correlate with each other
It makes no sense to me
You can always give this game the wife test
Does the wife like it?
Yes, that's definitely gonna happen
Uh, hey, other news
About the Nintendo Wii, now this sounds
Thank god, a lot different and I'm sure it's gonna
Get a lot of people very happy and I don't know how you feel
About this one, Loki
It was recently trademarked here in America
Final Fantasy IV The After Years
And that's a cell phone series
Over in Japan, well guess what?
It has been announced this week
That it's going to be coming out for
The Wii, well I guess it hasn't really been announced
But the ESRB has rated the title
An E on the Wii
So, uh, there you go
Final Fantasy IV The After Years
Apparently getting somewhat confirmed
For the Nintendo Wii
So, that probably won't be
Any mini games, I don't think it was over in Japan
And I think, if I remember correctly
I think the one in Japan was actually like
In the Final Fantasy IV engine
I think so, because it was a cell phone game
So I'm kind of curious to see if they
Still keep it looking like that on the Wii
It could be a download thing
Like it might be WiiWare, it might not necessarily be a disc
It could be something that's gonna be released
It's gonna be WiiWare, that's what it was supposed to be
That could be kind of cool then, because it could be
Like in the style of Mega Man 9, right?
That'd be cool
So, that
That could also be something that
Makes me want to break my little
Band, even though my hard drive
Is completely full
Come on, if they
Fuck this up
I'm out for blood
You heard it here first
Alright, so there you go, Final Fantasy IV The After Years
I want to definitely check that out
Well, there's a
Device that we've discussed on the show
A number of times, and I have
One myself in the family of it
Which I will not name nor say
Or let anyone know where
I'm hiding it, because I actually just found
It while I was cleaning it
Yeah, I can't find my DS
Thingy
No, I can't find my DS, too
And the thingy that's in the DS
I found my thingy
I found the thingy in the box
What thingy?
Okay, I have a Ninja Pass
I have not used it, I have nothing on it
I have a 4DS and an M3
And I put tons of pirated games on both of them
But, to be honest, I haven't played my DS
In forever, so much so that it's
Buried in a room somewhere, so
Back to my story
And it's funny that you mentioned the R4
That's why I bought it, too
Because, you know
The R4
Is now officially outlawed
In Japan
You cannot, um
There's actually an injunction
Filed against the Chinese
Um, manufacturer
Put out by the Tokyo District Court
And, um
It's now illegal to sell
Anywhere in Japan
Um
In fact, there, you can't find them
In stores anymore, at all
Um, Squeenix
Capcom, Nintendo
Um
You know, the big guys, they're
Saying that, you know
That because of the illegal sales
Um, you know, they're gonna also make
Sure that they're gonna
Try to, you know, knock down anyone
Who's selling the other types that are like
The R4
Um, but
Who knows, the other countries might be
Following suit
Interesting
We haven't heard about a lot of
Devices getting banned over there, so this is
Uh, and now, now
Loki, you're breaking the law
Of another country, but
Boo hoo
Rob
You see that cup
On the floor? What?
You get caned for that in Singapore
Oh gee, oh no
So you're breaking the law of another country
It doesn't matter, like I said, you know, I
I don't even play
My DS right now
Or my PSP
Uh, out of curiosity, is there anyone
In chat who owns one of these who thinks
This is, uh, you know, interesting
Surprising? Are you
Scared? Cause now you have one, or are you just
Like, whatever
I'm totally not surprised, to be honest
Yeah, I know, it's not, it's not totally surprising
But, uh, you know
Oh well, there's nothing
In, you know, unfortunately with the
Um, DS, they can't really flash it to
You know, not work
With, or to basically
Break it or anything, they can't do any firmware updates
Like they can with the, uh, PSP
Or whatever it means, they'll stop selling it
Or if you'll still be able to get them over here
Um
Well, they've already made them pretty hard to get
Um, in fact, when I was
Buying mine, um
They were pretty hard to get
And
You know, they were starting to pull them off, you know
Shelves online
And stuff like that, so that
You know, they wouldn't get in any lawsuit
Trouble, but, uh, luckily
I got both of mine, actually the M3
And the R4 are almost identical
In fact, I think there's like one little point
That you change on each chip that
You can convert them back and forth
And, um
I don't know, they work okay
You know, the one I bought, the M3 for
For Game Boy Advance
Homebrew stuff, because there was this one
Motocross game I wanted to try out, and there was some other
Like Zelda type game that I wanted to try out, that was kinda cool
Um
I haven't really played any ROMs
For the Game Boy Advance stuff
Not really interested in that
And, uh, DS stuff, it's fun to check stuff out
Every now and then, but really nothing holds my
Interest for
Hardly any time, so I don't
I just don't see the point in spending, you know, 20 bucks
On, you know, each of these games
And that's on a cheap game, you know
Unless you get something Square Enix, which is like
$40 for a fucking DS game
Which is retarded
Um, I just can't see myself
Spending that kind of money on a game that I'm only gonna
Play for a few hours and just kinda throw
You know, to the side
It's just my own thing, economy's tough, you know what
And I wasn't gonna buy your game anyways, so
But hey, I spend
My money, I spend plenty of money on
Other things, you know, like I said
You know, what, the last week or so
Or a couple weeks ago, I
Five copies of Lost and Damned, so
You know, I'm paying my money
Alright, let's move on with more news, we gotta wrap up Part A
Get to Part B tonight
Yes, um, so
Kind of a game that I like
Um, you know
Saints Row, well, another
Guy, a music artist
That has broken into the game genre as well
50 Cent is actually
Looking to option
Saints Row for a movie
Now
This sounds like an okay
Idea to me, but
Not that great, I don't know
There are some actual characters in Saints
Row, so it works, but then again
The whole game is very sandbox-ish
And you can make your own
You know, main characters, so
Designing who the main character
Is gonna be is a little bit tough, I think
But as far as an actual storyline goes
It's kind of compelling, there is one
But, I don't know
I think that type, anything that's
Sandbox-ish, as far as
Gameplay goes, it's gonna be very hard to
Um, make
A movie out of, but
Anyways, he's interested in it
He says, according to
50 Cent
He said that his
Relationship with THQ
Is very good, and
You'll see Saints Row, he's
Optioning the rights for that right now
Dude, I hope the plot is as awesome as
Blood on the Sand
You know, Blood on the Sand, I think to be honest
Is just
Fun, that's the whole point, it wasn't like
He was trying to be serious, I think it was just fun
Speaking of plot and movies
And something that didn't make our show
Roll tonight, but I was chatting with somebody before
The show about this, have you heard about
How horrifically the new
Street Fighter movie is doing, apparently it has a
0% on Rotten Tomatoes
Right now, oh I would believe it, I mean
It looks like crap, I'm sorry
I, one of my live journal friends went
And saw it and said it is worse than the original
Street Fighter movie, if you can imagine
Yeah, that was actually a ringing
Endorsement to me, I love bad movies
Now I kind of want to go see it
It's out? Yeah, it just came out on Friday
I completely forgot about it
I wonder how terrible it did at the box office
Because box office numbers come out
Let me go look
It was pretty much
Street Fighter the movie this week
And Jonas Brothers
In 3D
Okay, Madea Goes to Jail
Was the number one movie this week
With 16.5 million bucks
Jonas Brothers
12.7 million, which they say was
Actually underperforming compared to the Miley Cyrus
Movie a few months ago
Slumdog Millionaire 12.1 million
But it just won the Oscar
So it was not in the top 3
Nor was it 4
5 or 6
Or 7
Street Fighter came out its opening weekend
Number 8
4.6 million dollars
What did it beat? Confessions of a Shopaholic
In its third week of release
Ah, Friday the 13th
In its third week of release
Fired Up in its second week of release
Ah, but what beat it?
Paul Blart
Mall Cop in its seventh week of release
Hey, made more money than Street Fighter
The Legend of Chun-Li in its seventh week
Of release
Coraline, but I hear that's a good movie
So we don't need to make fun of that
It's Street
Okay, it's a Street Fighter movie
That has like
Hardly any
Characters in it that, you know, make any
Sense, you know, Bison doesn't even look like
Bison
Balrog is, I don't even know what
Kinda character he's supposed to be playing
And Chun-Li doesn't even look like Chun-Li
And the plot's just like
Huh?
I hope they all do their pose
At the end though, that was the best part of the first movie
Alright, well hey
Speaking of game movies, a good
Game movie, I think anyway, a lot of people
Disagree with me, but one of the better ones
In many many years, in my opinion, Silent Hill
Was, you know, a video game movie
That came out, I liked it, we all
Generally liked it right here, I saw it four times in the
Theater, you really liked it, I saw it twice
Loki liked it, yeah, so I think we can all
Agree that the Silent Hill movie's pretty awesome
And of course
We love the series of games, love the series
Of games, well guess what, maybe not so much
The last few, but yeah, well
I didn't think they were terrible, but
Anyway, obviously one of the best ones
Was the first one, and guess what
Since we're talking about remaking games
For the Wii, a WiiMake if you will
There's been lots of these types of
WiiMakes coming out recently, now most of them
Granted have just been old GameCube games getting new
Controls, but what if they were to remake
The original PlayStation Silent Hill
Game on the Nintendo Wii
With extra fog?
Hopefully, you know why they did the fog
Why, cause loading or something?
Uh, well anyway
This is coming
From a report from VG
24-7, apparently Konami
Is planning a port
Of the Silent Hill game
For the Wii, also coming to the
PSP as well, Climax
The folks who did Silent Hill
Origins are the ones that are supposed to be doing this new
Remake, so that could be interesting
You know, I'm surprised that Climax
Has an exactly optioned
N-Spaces engine that they use for
The game that's not ever coming out
Unfortunately, Winter, cause remember
That game looked very much Silent Hill
Wonder if they're using it, though
You gotta wonder, maybe that's part of
Why they're doing this on the Wii
Is maybe the folks at Konami saw this
And was like, hey, we want you to
Make this a Silent Hill game, but we got a really
Good idea, why don't you redo the
First story, or something like that, you know?
Could be
Remake the first one is a test of your skill
Could be, huh?
Why don't they just make a new one?
Well, maybe they want the new ones to be
On the 360 in PlayStation 3
Stop remaking shit, seriously!
I want a remake
I wouldn't mind a remake in the first game
I really freaking want a good Silent Hill remake
Here's the thing, it could be a remake
Like a new play control remake
Yoink, yoink, yoink, whatever, right?
But it could also be a remake like Metroid Zero
Which is an awesome remake
I hate to interrupt real quick
But I'm so glad that the
Monitor obstructed the camera's view
Of the gesture that you just made
Why? What'd I do?
Oh, yeah
That's why we have the big monitor here
It censors my hand when I do things like that
So no one can see Rob fapping
Alright, look
You know I have to derail it
Alright
Silent Hill, we want it
You know other stuff we want?
Punch out!
Nah, I just want to punch
So, so
Getting this
May 18th, we're getting Punch Out on the Wii
And little Mac looks like he
All done grown up
He actually looks kind of mean in this picture
So um
We will be getting some um
Punch out and hopefully
That we will get like King Hippo and
You know Glass Joe and all of those
I hope they make new characters though, I mean
I'm sure we're gonna get new characters
I think they'll have to be some new characters
I will bet you, I will bet you there are not
New characters in this, I bet you it's just the remake
Of the first game
Really? You think they'd be that bold?
I think they'd be that lazy, yes
I do think that they'd be that lazy
I hope not
I'm sorry, I have no
Optimism in Nintendo anymore
Oh snap
Uh, GameGuru seems to
Kind of have that same skepticism saying I'll wait for
Reviews before getting Punch Out
From our chatroom, chat.orangeandredo.com
I mean, don't get me wrong, it looks good
But I just- You know what I say to your skepticism
Huh
Fine, say that all you want
But it's gonna happen the way I said it
So, Tigerclaw making an
Interesting point in chatroom regarding remakes
In this whole discussion, kind of talking about
Hollywood remakes, Tigerclaw says
Have you heard that Hollywood wants to remake the Never
Ending story, yes I did hear that this
Week, and geez Louise
Come up with a new idea, no
Exactly, no no no no no
You do not remake the Never Ending story
Cause they weren't that great, I mean they were
Okay, but the first movie is epic
If you're a kid though
Is that great, it remains epic
The other two
The second one had the guy who played the Flash
As the dad
It's always why I like that, because I kind of
Loved that show
Even though it failed
But I can do without a remake
Come on
If you can actually understand her name
Say my name
It won't make a point, you know
Say my name
You never understand what the hell he's saying
Anyway, forget it
Couple more stories and we'll get to part B
Classic Game of the Week coming up as well
Maybe that's her name, it's foreign
What?
So this week to coincide with the movie release
Xbox Live Arcade
PlayStation Network and PC will be
Getting the Watchmen The End is Nigh
The kind of prequels to
The whole Watchmen storyline
And it will be sold for a
Whopping $20
Or 1600 Microsoft points
On Xbox Live Arcade
That sounds a bit expensive to me
But it's supposed to be pretty good
It's kind of a brawler type game
But
20 bucks, really?
I'm gonna wait
This movie is also not getting some good early reviews
Although a lot of people
There's lots of fanboys with big big boners for Watchmen
You know, I'm interested to see it
But you know, I don't know
It looks okay
It looks okay
I'd see it, but not opening day
I'd kind of wait and see what some of my friends think about it
I mean, the story's interesting
But it's not like, oh my god, this is the best
Novel ever, you know, this is the best
Graphic novel ever, ever
Cause if that's the best graphic novel
That there ever was
Thank god, graphic novels suck
I mean, cause seriously
That is where you're setting the bar
I don't think so
Alright, well we'll see
One more story for you guys
And we'll get to the classic game of the week
And it has to do with EA
Could EA possibly be making their own music game soon?
And you might be thinking
Well, don't they already kind of do rock band?
Well, yeah, but they more distribute a game
That Harmonix is making
Here's the interesting thing
EA apparently, it was their chief operating officer
John Pleasence
Made a statement at the Goldman Sachs
Technology and Internet Conference
Quote, when we look back five years
The fantasy of being a rock star
By punching the buttons that are flowing down the screen
Is going to be one implementation
In what is going to be a very large category
There are lots of other things you can do with music
And we're working on interesting things
And we know our competition
Is working on interesting things
So, what exactly are they working on?
However, he went on to say
We're not in any position to announce anything
I think it's a robust category
Over the coming years
There will hopefully be lots of things
We will do in the music category
So, could EA be up to something?
Of course they're up to something
Music games are, you know
Selling like crazy right now
Of course they're trying to get another piece of that
So, I'm sure they're trying to think of something
We have some very interesting music gaming news
Coming up a little later in part B of our show
But first, we're about to our commercial break
Or, not really commercial break
But a free break of music here on Orange LA
And before we get to that though
We're going to get to our classic game of the week
Because we always like to pay respects
To a classic video game here at the end of part A every week
So, to do that, DarkSakura
Is going to dig through the gaming archives
And find a game that she thinks is worthy
Of being the classic game of the week
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
The classic game of the week is Parasol Stars
Which is a fun little game
Did you ever play Parasol Stars, Rob?
Yes, I did actually
Parasol Stars is actually the...
It's in the series of Bubble Bobble
A direct sequel to Rainbow Islands
Where you basically use your parasols
To gather raindrops
Which you can shoot out at your little enemies
You can bop them
Or you can protect yourself from the enemies
With your little parasol
And it was actually the first one to never have an arcade release
It came out on the PC Engine in Japan
And then we got it thanks to Working Designs
I never realized it was never an arcade game
We got it from Working Designs though
In the US who was responsible for bringing us tons of different
Really awesome games from Japan
Like they gave us Ray Earth
Silhouette Mirage
Didn't they do Radiant Silver Gun?
I don't remember
They were responsible? No
But at any rate, it's you know
Oh yeah, another game that I covered on the show
Was Brainfart
Popful Mail
But anyway, back to Parasol Stars
So yeah, this is a Taito game
Came out in 1991
And you play as Bub and Bob
But you play as their human counterparts
Which would be...
The same characters from Rainbow Islands
Yeah, the same from Rainbow Islands, Bubby and Bobby
What creative names
It was only out on TurboGrafx
Wasn't it out on Super Nintendo as well?
I could be wrong
Sorry sorry, my bad
So basically Parasol Stars though
It was sort of retconned out of their continuity
Because Bub and Bob got turned back into little dragons
For Bubble Symphony and all those
Bubble Memories and Bubble Symphony
And so Parasol Stars is considered sort of a side story
A guide and a side story
To the whole bubble world
You know
At any rate, like I said
You can get different items
You can also
You have to collect these star items
As you go through that lets you access
These other planets
Because you're basically going through the levels and moving to other planets
So that you can get all the stuff to save the world
So you have 10 rounds on each planet
And there's a boss on each one
Except on level 30
Wait, wrong, sorry
But when you get the star items
You have access to two other planets
One that's around Bubble Bobble
And one around another game called Jack and Pop
They're not available on the main screen
You actually have to get stuff to unlock it
And then
You have the final boss
Who is the one responsible for stealing all the color
From the world
And
Is like the uber boss of everything
And so you get the true ending that way
So like I said
You gather the drops, you can throw them
And if you gather like
Five drops
Then you can just do the smack down with a big
Kick ass
Attack
So
Oh also each of the drops has a different elemental theme
So that's pretty cool
But yeah
As far as I'm aware
I think this did
I think it came out on
The Amiga
If I remember correctly
The Atari ST
There's a Game Boy version
The NES
I want to say
And
Of course the
Turbo Graphics 16
Or PC Engine
But yeah I think this came out on the
NES
Which is probably its most notable version
Is the Turbo Graphics one
There you go
Alright
There you go
Parasol Star is your classic game of the week
If you're a fan of Bubble Bobble
Right in the same series
So check that out
Alright that's going to bring Part A of Orange Lounge Radio
To a close tonight
For those of you on Justin TV
It looks like we're going to do a little bit of a
Game look tonight

March the 1st of 2009
Here for our 315th episode
Of Orange Lounge Radio
Which we've been looking at a game
Here in studio on Justin TV
Eat Lead
How's this game been going for you Loki?
It's going okay
I haven't been watching a lot of this on
Justin TV
I was running the house during the break
I was trying to get to a
Save point real quick
Did I just die?
I think you did because you turned your back
When something was going ahead
I haven't really been paying attention
Well I'll pause it for later
Alright maybe we'll look at it a little more
Actually no I'm not going to pause it I'm going to quit
Alright we got some
News we're going to get back into here on part B
We got to wait for Loki to get set up here
So um
I don't know how do we kill time at this point
Loki I need you to
Be here to start reading news at the top of the show
What are we going to do?
Alright we're
Resetting back up Justin TV if you're joining us
Here on this Sunday night
Justin TV slash Orange Launch Radio
If you want to see us live
Taping the show
And of course you can always join our chat room as well
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
Oh thank you
Breslull is there in chat and is reminding me
Of something I wanted to mention at some point during the show tonight
That is Orange Launch Radio
U.S. All March Madness is going on right now
And some surprising
Not ties but some surprising votes
Going on right now
Orange Launch Radio U.S. All March Madness
If I remember right last time I looked
Mega Man 2 is beating Ocarina of Time
Which is certainly a controversial
Little match up going on right now
But what's interesting is that there will be
Three things in the
Or three Zelda games in the top eight
If um
The voting does
Go in Zelda Ocarina of Time
Favor because I think right now
The Legend of Zelda and
Link to the Past
Are both ahead as well
Could be very interesting
How that all plays out
So again if you want to participate in that you can go to our forums
By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast
It will already be down to eight
But if you're listening live on this Sunday evening
They're at the Sweet 16 right now
So check that out
Alright
Almost done Loki?
Alright
He's just plugging the computer back in getting ready to do
The encoding for JustDB
You want to do an email real fast?
Sure why not?
Do a preliminary mailbag?
Yes because then that means there will be less to read later
Alright sure well let's start off with an email
I don't have the music though so uh just read an email
I have to read this because it's super amusing
This is an email from Sauce
Alrighty
Hey OLR I know you guys are fans of laughing at stupid people
So I thought I would share
A sad but true story with you
To make it video game related
Imagine Super Mario Brothers music playing in the background
Uh I might be able to arrange that actually
Okay
I'm sorry this is actually so funny that I do want to read it right away
Okay
Um on Friday afternoon I was at UNLV
Heading to my graphic design class
From the second floor of the building
This hallway is open air
You can see the major street
In front of the university
As I was heading into class
I witnessed a car accident
An old smaller size pickup truck rear-ended
An orange new beetle
A loud sound
So many of my classmates came out of the computer lab to see what had happened
As we watched the beetle pulled into the parking lot
In front of our building
The pickup truck sat there for about a minute
Without pulling out of the street
And then once the beetle's owner had gotten out of his car
The truck made a u-turn and sped off down the street
We were obviously quite appalled by this
But what could be done
We realized that none of us had gotten the guy's license plate
And then one of my classmates shouted down to the beetle driver
LOOK
And pointed to the street
And it became over music
Because in the middle of the street
Where the accident had occurred
Laid the front bumper of the truck
With the license plate still attached
The beetle owner called the police
And a few of us gave a statement to the police officer
About the accident
We don't know
We don't know why the guy in the truck took off
Maybe he didn't have insurance
Or maybe he had outstanding tickets
But I'm pretty sure the moral of the story
Is that if you're going to turn
A car accident that you were responsible for
Into a felony hit and run
You might want to make sure that you don't leave
Any incriminating evidence behind
Like your bumper and your license plate
I just wish I could have seen the look on the truck driver's face
When he got home and realized he had left his license plate behind
Cheers, Lauren
That was worthwhile
Alright, now let's get into some gaming news
That was a good story
Loki, yes
So
There's some interesting stuff
We've heard some controversy before
About Xbox Live names and
Profiles, etc. containing
Different things and getting accounts banned
Including
There was one that someone had made
That was to the effect of
Gay gamer or something like that
And they got banned because of the word
Gay in there
There was a guy named Richard
Which was his actual name
And he ended up getting banned as well
Because gay was in the name
Well now we have a self-identified lesbian
Being banned from Xbox Live
Because in her
I guess
Profile it said that she was a lesbian
And so
Apparently
That rubbed someone the wrong way
So she got banned
And
Now of course people
All are kind of up in arms
About the whole thing and
Apparently
Microsoft's Steven Toulouse
An Xbox Live team member
Has made a post on his
Personal blog regarding the situation
And they're hopefully going to explore some policy changes
And also
I guess Glad is waiting on the story
As well, so
Well, I just
I'll link it in the chatroom, I blogged about
This actually yesterday
I have choice things to say about
The way this was handled
And I think Inelegant does not
Even remotely
Touch what a crying shame it was
So
I won't say more than that
Basically the whole situation was
As Microsoft noted
In a statement they said
That users may not create a gamertag
Or use text in any
Profile field that includes
Comments that look, sound, like
Stand for, hint at, abbreviate
Or insinuate
Content of a potentially sexual nature
Profiles that do are asked
To change the language and are suspended
Until changes are made
And it says, I guess
The company also states it does not allow
Gamertags or profiles to identify any form
Of sexual orientation
Which is funny because there's nothing about that in their terms of usage
Nor their code of conduct
Nothing
I read the entire
Both of them
There is not a single thing
In the terms of usage
Or in the code of conduct
On Xbox.com
Nothing, zero
Zilch
I don't know, you'd think I'd have a stronger opinion on this
You know, being the gay one on the show
But I don't know
I kind of feel it might be one of those unfortunate things
There's a lot of these things on blog posts
That, you know, kind of take it and run
Tend to be, I kind of feel like it might be one of those things
That's being blown horrifically out of proportion
Like there just might be something
Else going on
I don't know, for all we know
For all we know, she could have been
Doing other questionable stuff on Xbox Live
We don't know
Basically what was going on
Did you actually read her post on the consumerist?
Yeah, I read all the things on the consumerist
But the consumerist is also not
Widely known for always doing complete research
According to other sites
But I'm saying from her post
Yeah, I saw her post
Well, the thing is that I've seen people on
Xbox Live do this
I've seen just, you know, blatant
Harassment going on
And, you know, people are like that
You know, outside of the virtual environment
Oh, don't get me wrong
That's totally inexcusable
And should definitely be dealt with
But there's no reason why someone
Shouldn't be able to, I mean
I actually agree that, you know
It shouldn't matter in the end
But, you know, if she's
Proud of it, why not have something
In her, you know, what is said
On the terms of usage on
Xbox Live was, and this is
Item number five, how you may not
Use the service
Create a gamertag avatar or use text
In other profile fields that may offend
Other members, that's what it said
So basically
It's, you know
It can be summarized as
The Xbox Live powers
That be saying, oh
Being gay is offensive
Because they're all offended
That you're a lesbian
That's
How, you know, that's pretty much
How it came out as
I wonder if any of these people that were harassing her
Were ever dealt with
If they were ever punished
Now see, what's interesting is that in Microsoft's response
To this whole thing, they say
In the Xbox Live terms of use
A member may not create a gamertag or use
Text in other profile fields that include
Comments that look, sound like, stand for, hint at
Abbreviate, or insinuate content
Of a potentially sexual nature
Profiles that do are asked to change the language
And suspended until changes are made
In regard to sexual orientation, for gamertags
Or profiles we do not allow expression
Of any type of orientation, be it
Hetero or other
That is not in
Their terms of usage, in fact
It's in terms of use right now
Could it be, make sure you're looking at Xbox Live
And not Xbox.com, because there probably are
Different ones
There's the Xbox Live terms of use, that's what I went to
So, hold on, let me find it real quick
Because, yeah, I'm curious kind of what, you know
Why they would say this
If it's not something, you know
And I realize they could be kind of blurring what's really there
And what it is
Here's what it says
Create a gamertag, avatar, or use text in the profile fields
That may offend other members
That includes comments that look like, sound like
Stand for, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate
Or relate to any of the following
Profane words, phrases, topics
Or content of a sexual nature
Hate speech, including but not limited to
Racial, ethnic, or religious slurs
Illegal drugs slash controlled substances
Or illegal activities
It does not say
Orientation
You know, just because
Just because, you know, if you put on there
Lesbian, it's not saying
Um, it's not the same
As exactly saying, I like to fuck chicks
And now
If she, because there were people
There were people up there
Who fully had, you know
Really sexist comments
In their profiles, I've seen them before
But, you know
Nothing about orientation
These were all, you know, pretty offensive things
You know, what happened to them?
Why aren't they banned?
You know, I don't think
That listing your orientation
Exactly relates to the act of fucking
Now if she said in there
Um, I'm a lesbian
And I like, you know
Big strap-ons, then I understand
Just put, I heart scissoring
Well you're, hey
I like cutting paper with scissors
Therefore it's scissoring
Here's my question
Is that if they allow her back on the service
Which is gonna be the inevitable conclusion
You know this is what's gonna happen
Is that Microsoft's gonna have to, you know
Kinda eat it up on this or whatever
And let this person back
Does that mean that Loki could go on and on his profile
Put, I love lesbians
There's nothing wrong with that
It's not, you know, slanderous
Or anything like that, it's just stating
What is probably a fact
Loki, do you love lesbians?
Some lesbians
I don't really love or hate them
Let's just assume Loki wants to put
His hands on his profile
It's like bird watching
For the matter of argument
I don't know
But do you see what I mean
They did not have anything
You know, he said in his comment
Including, you know, orientation
You know, listening to that
But nowhere in the terms of usage
That is a blatant lie
Interesting
He has lied to the public
Through MTV News
It is in print
On not just my own blog
But on plenty of news sites now
Where he is a goddamn liar
But, I don't know
I mean, still
It's not like they are talking to
GLAAD about the whole thing
And the human rights
Or whatever they're called
You know, the human rights campaign
HRC and all this stuff
It just seems like if they were that
You know, against all this or something
You know, in a way
I'm kind of glad that they're not star star
Starring it out like Sony does in
Home
It's basically, they have a list
Of banned words
That are considered offensive
And yeah, they have to unfortunately
Cover everything
Including, you know, homo
And all that stuff
And that's why they have the gay in there as well
Because people use it in derogatory fashion
And lesbian is in there as well
That's on this black list
But that's what it is
And because this person had it in their profile
That's why their account was banned
It's just like the guy Richard Gaywood or whatever
His name is Gaywood, that's his name
Hers wasn't a random banning
Hers was banned
When she reported
The harassment of other people against her
And they said, oh, well it's because of your
Profile ban
They banned her
Because other people were offended
Yeah, I'd agree
That's pretty messed up
They need to ban other
It's just rampant on Xbox Live
In some of those games, you know
They don't want me as a moderator
No
You know why they don't want me as a moderator
I will fuck their shit up
Seriously
They say, and you know, I've even seen
People that follow on Twitter, they're like
Seriously, when you see that stuff
You know, the fag, fag, fag, report it
They will do something about it
So, I don't know
I do, when I
When people annoy me on there, I report it
I'm a tattle
Basically what was happening though
Is all these people are following her from area to area
While she's trying to play a game
And just do her own thing
That's blatant harassment
Why haven't those people been banned
I mean, I think that if you go after someone
With malicious intent
Well, here's the question though
Because we don't know who they are
I would love to find out
But at the same time
You know, I think that any kind of
Malicious act like that
Should be immediately
Dealt with, I think that there needs to be
Some, I think that if
You're reported for a malicious act
Then you need to
At least have
You know
Get off my internet
Like, say an hour suspension
So that you're
The situation can be reviewed
Uh, cheeseburger
In chat, chat.orangelandradio.com says
All hail DarkSakura or ban
Haha
Uh, DarkSakura agrees
Ban the guy they're targeting
Um
Yeah
I don't know, I'm kinda curious to see what ultimately
Becomes of this, I still feel like it's kinda early on
I think we'll see more kinda come out of this next week
And I think we're gonna end up revisiting this topic
Next week, but in the meantime
If you have your own thoughts on it
You can give us a call later in the show
Or you can always send us an email, of course
DarkSakura loves emails
Mailbag at orangelandradio.com
Uh, well on Xbox Live
For those of you that haven't gotten banned from your profiles yet
There are some things to look forward to in the future
Worms Armageddon Decades
Is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade
Uh, this is
Apparently a
Like, old game, about 10 years old
It's coming out previously, what was this on before?
Like the Nintendo 64, I think, and the PlayStation
And PC
Uh, they're remaking this for Xbox Live Arcade
Which isn't too surprising when you consider that the original
Worms is a pretty good seller
On Xbox Live Arcade
So it's about time for a quote unquote
Sequel, and that's what this is
There you go
Worms Armageddon, coming out soon on Xbox Live
There was so much, my husband
Played Worms so much
It's no Scorched Earth
Just because I love Worms, it's no Scorched Earth
It's cute though
But Scorched Earth is hardcore
Did you play the other game that's like Scorched Earth, sorta?
Uh, no, what's it called?
Death Tanks? No, I haven't played that
That's on there, interesting
I don't know if it's any good, but
I love Scorched Earth
Who doesn't love Scorched Earth?
That game is awesome
Cause, it's hot
Talk about the game, silly pants
My pants aren't silly, they're denim
Moving on
Back to the Xbox Live Arcade
Even though they're
Bastards in charge
Um, I'm getting
And this is me specifically
Getting this, this is for me
At least in my own private universe, this is for me
One of my favorite
Ever games
Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade
According to Famitsu
Do we know what that is? I'll give you a clue
It involved twin sticks
I have twin sticks for this game
By the way, Rob
Did you know that?
Somehow I'm not surprised
Virtual On, Oratario Tangrum
Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade
And they can't use my twin sticks!
I actually have the Dreamcast twin sticks
You can
But you'd have to modify them
Ugh, no
I'll just make a converter
Um, but yeah
It's gonna be on there for
Uh, 1200 points
And, oh my god
I love this game
Now could you use the twin sticks on like the maim version
Or something? Do they even have a maim version?
There's a maim version, but
You have to have like the
I think you do have to
Play it with twin sticks
Cause they're twin analog
Yeah
I don't know, I want one of these cabinets in my house
Because this game is fucking sexy
Did Michael Jackson have one of these?
Huh? Did Michael Jackson have one of these for sale?
I don't know
I didn't look
Honestly though
There's only one more game really
Other than this that I would want to have a deluxe cab of
But
You probably can't guess what it is
Planet Harrier
But um
Anyway, but yeah
It's robot on robot action
Ooh kinky, but seriously
It's um, just beat em up
At the end of the game, and I actually
Have, um, Dan and I have two clocks
That Sega released
I have one of the Fayen, and then we've got
One of the last boss
The annoying bitch that he is
So
Get the game
Um
Well there's another game that you won't have to actually pay for
That will be coming to
Well actually you may have to pay for this one
Um
Quake 3 Arena for Xbox Live Arcade
Is close to being finished
And apparently this was first
Spotted as an ESRB link
Uh, a leak
Actually I do remember the leak, I think this was around E3 even
Last year
And um
Apparently it's um
Looking pretty good, and that kind of makes sense
You know with some of the other Quake themed stuff
That was um, or coming soon so
Um
Neat
You know speaking of Quake, I tried to get into Quake Live this week
And I see people talking about that in chat right now actually
Um, it looks like Hitstun's looking for people to play
Quake Live with, but I could not get past that queue
Cause you know the day it was announced
Thousands of people in the queue because everybody was
Uh, probably getting thrown to it
From different blog sites, but you know
I went back earlier today to try to check it out
And the queue was only 35 people
Which sadly I didn't have time to wait
Again because um, I had to do
This show tonight, but I'm gonna try and check it out a little
Later on tonight, but in looking at the demo videos
And stuff, it looks kinda awesome
I'm very curious to see if it plays
As well as it's advertised
It should limit everybody to one life, and then that way the queue will go faster
Maybe, I don't know, no I mean
You know it's gonna get hammered the first day
But it looks like it's eased up quite a bit
Cause the queue was only 35, that wouldn't have been that bad
You know I've seen WoW queues that were worse than that
But um, yeah
I guess right now, right this second there's no queue
So some of our listeners might be off to play that
Um, but I will probably check that out a little later tonight
So, we'll see
Um, and I would definitely
Check out Quake 3 Arena when it hits Xbox Live
That was one of my favorite Quake games, was the third one
There's a lot of games like that that are coming out
There's also that, um, other
Uh, god I don't remember the name of it now
But it was the one that they had
With the geophysics processor at one time
Um, that game
Uh, whatever
It's some psychic war game that's gonna be coming out
And then I think there's another game
Very similar to that as well, that's supposed to be on its way
So a lot of those arena, unreal
Type of tournament stuff
Coming out for Live Arcade
Makes sense because everybody
Loves first person shooters on the 360, you know
Mhmm
Uh, also big on the 360 soon
Will be Sam and Max, the first two
Seasons of Sam and Max are on their way
To Xbox Live Arcade, that's right
Sam and Max Save the World
Is the name of episode one, or season one
And Sam and Max Beyond Time
and Space season two, they are on their way
To Xbox Live Arcade
Uh, which is good because this will really expand the audience
So previously these games were only available on PC
I think a lot of people played them through GameTap
Um, I think they made their way to the Wii
Eventually, with the strong pack games
Uh, season one did
So, but finally they're gonna be making their way to Xbox Live Arcade
And this is where people will actually be able to download a demo
Because demos are mandatory on the Xbox Live games
I think you'll probably finally see
These games start to get a lot more of the
Attention it deserves, at least from the console people
I mean, I know a lot of PC gamers have already found their way to it
Uh, but this is gonna open it up
To a whole new audience
Good news, and kind of expected in a way
You kind of figured this was gonna happen eventually
So, there you go
Sam and Max coming soon to Xbox Live Arcade
Well, I have some interesting news
Oh really?
Has to do with the ESRB
More leaks?
Yep, classic rock track for rock band
Um, isn't that kind of cool
It's supposed to be getting a teen rating
And uh, it's actually on there for violent swearing and drug use
So
I think it's just that song pack that they're gonna put out of all previously released
They're saying The Joker, Take the Money and Run, and Holiday in Cambodia by the Dead Kennedys
Oh yeah, that's already there
Yeah, it sounds like it's gonna be like the rock band track pack one or whatever that is
Those were examples that were given about pretty much kind of the same thing to expect
Gotcha
Too bad they don't have independent achievements
That would make it a lot more worthwhile
You know, I wonder if that ACDC rock band game's really fallen in price yet
I'll get it when it's in the bargain bin
But I don't want to pay like
It's all live tracks too, it's kind of like ehhhh
I'll check it out just for, you know, because I'm an achievement whore
And the fact that, you know, I don't mind increasing my rock band library
There's a couple good ACDC songs
But, um, you know, I'm not gonna get it until it's in the $5 bin
Which you know it will be in Walmart eventually
And when it's in the $5 bin, you buy it, you dump the songs to your hard drive
And then you sell that shit back
There you go
There you go
Now you're talking
That's how we do it
This is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah, some other stuff that's interesting for Rock Band 2
The UK's finally getting a few different versions of Rock Band 2
Apparently the 360 version was on its exclusive kick over there as well
Now Rock Band 2 will be coming to the Playstation 3 and Playstation 2
On March 27th in the UK
And will be coming to the Wii on April 24th as well
And of course these will be available in their bundles, I believe
And, or actually maybe just game only right now
And then there's also gonna be the standalone stuff as well
And then I guess they are doing a bundle with the instrument edition
Which will include the drums, guitar, and microphone
I just wanna say, Unfolded Raptor in chat following up with the Rock Band thing we were talking about just a minute ago
I saw the ACDC at Walmart for $20 in the bargain bin, Rob
Some bargain, I agree
That's not that much down from the original asking price, right?
Yeah
But speaking of bargains, Hitstun reminds us that Lost Planet on the PC is $5 this weekend
On Steam
And that was a deal I was thinking about checking out
But then again, I never really cared for the demo, it's just not my kind of game
I understand why people like Lost Planet, but it's not my kind of game
I'm thinking about going back and playing Dead Rising again
Oh yeah, Dead Rising is fun, I wish I had multiplayer, I hope they do that in the second one
It'll be much fun
They will, I'm sure
They've got to
Alright, so hooray for the UK finally getting Rock Band
Well in other Rock Band news, obviously there was a lot of Playstation news this week at Destination Playstation
This sounds pretty awesome
Rock Band Unplugged is a game that's going to be coming out for the PSP
It's a rock band on a portable console
Very interesting when you consider where did Guitar Hero go?
The DS
But now you have Rock Band coming out on the PSP
But guess what?
There's not going to be any type of guitar attachment or drum attachment or anything like that
No, apparently a website named Primotek apparently has some details about what the gameplay could be like
Take this with a grain of salt
Some of this sounds a little bit like fanboy wank to me
This could be the real deal
I think it's the stuff from Destination Playstation probably
Well also kind of thinking back a couple weeks ago when they were, well let me get to that in a minute
Here's some of the possible gameplay details from this
Apparently you're going to be using the left, up, triangle and circle buttons to control instruments
And you also will go from instrument to instrument with the shoulder buttons
And then what you do, you play a segment of a certain instrument to get the score or the multiplier going
And then you switch to a different instrument
Hmm, what game am I describing?
Frequency and amplitude anybody?
And remember a couple weeks ago there was that guy who made the statement about
Oh we'd love to revisit frequency or amplitude someday when the opportunity presents itself
If you kind of, you know, tie that in with this, this definitely seems like a possibility
And a pretty good idea for a game
And one I would definitely pick up
This is like frequency and amplitude and that stuff, I'm all over this game
All over it
So hooray to that, and I know a lot of music game fans are very happy about that
Are you a big music game fan in frequency and amplitude, Dark Sakura?
Does this sound like something you might play?
Maybe
Again, songs are everything
You know, that's one other thing to keep in mind
Is that if the song list sucks, then forget it
However if MTV Games is involved, I'm sure they will be able to get the artist they need
So I would be far more interested in this than the Guitar Hero one
Because what I like, what kind of the difference is
Is that Guitar Hero DS was like
How do we take the Guitar Hero game on the 360 and on the, you know, Nintendo Wii
And smush it down into a DS
Where this is, okay how do we build a band
Or how do we build a game in the rock band genre on this platform
Knowing that these are our restrictions
Go
You know, I think that they're taking a completely different approach to it
I think will help them create the better game
But we'll see
We shall soon see
Well how about More Stuff?
More Stuff, my favorite
For iPhone people, there are actually two titles that are out by Taito
And no, they're not bubble wobble
The first is Cooking Mama
Where you can use the accelerometer and play your game
It's for $6.99 or 5 pounds, 5.5 euro
There's also Space Invaders
Where it's tilt and you can drag and you can use touch screen
And there's bonus character art and stuff
And it's like 5 bucks
So cool
Neat
I'm getting a little, I don't know
I'm getting a little sick of all the, let's take our existing things
And push them down into the iPhone
I'm putting on Try Cooking Mama
Good point for MacDeft and Chad
It's not Space Invaders Extreme
I'm a little, you know, I'm a little worn out on the old school Space Invaders
If it was Space Invaders Extreme with the awesome soundtrack
Which the iPhone would be a good platform for
I would be all over that, but
Doesn't sound like it
Oh well
Prince of Persia, the epilogue download content
Was supposed to have been out already
But it's been delayed to March 5th
Not that long of a wait though
The price has been announced at $10
And of course this game
It will pick up from the end of the game
And hopefully make up I guess for what was apparently
A crappy ending, I don't know
I never really played to the end of Prince of Persia
Actually I didn't get to the end either
Didn't really play Prince of Persia, but
I probably played a little more than you
It was a good time, but I just got distracted
Well you definitely played more than me because I didn't touch it at all
Oh well there you go
It's fine, you should pop it in and check it out
It's a fun game
You gave it to me, it was a good game
But um
Yeah
Easy achievements if you kept the 360 version
I have the PS3 one
So it's trophies, but still
Same idea, right?
Well once again it's just too many games coming out
I don't have enough time to play them all
Oh well
Well I'm one of those weird people that has a Netflix account
And I hardly ever use it
So it's like just a vacuum sucking my money away
Because I never watch the movies that they send me
But one thing I do love about Netflix
Is the streaming Netflix
One thing I like about the streaming
Versus the DVDs or Blu-ray through the mail
Is that you don't have to wait for streaming
If you want to watch something you can watch it right now
You don't have to wait for a disc to be delivered to you
So I love the Xbox 360 streaming
And I'm loving some of these rumors I'm hearing this week
Apparently Netflix is planning on a streaming only subscription
In the foreseeable future
This comes from a report from Reuters
Which is one of the massive news reporting agencies
Along with Associated Press
So yeah this sounds like it's coming in the future
No word if they're going to expand the amount that's offered on the streaming subscription
Because sadly there isn't a lot available right now
I mean there's some good like NBC TV shows
And you know there's some indie movies
And random ass documentaries
Are available on the service
But they don't have a lot of new news stuff you know
So it could use a little buffing up
But who knows
Apparently Netflix is considering launching a streaming only plan
But no word on exactly how much that's going to cost
Apparently Netflix just exploded in the amount of usage of the streaming movie service
In the last few months
No doubt from the 360 Netflix app
Which earlier was reported they have what a million people using it
So there you go
Hopefully it won't be that expensive
Apparently you know maybe I should just downgrade my plan to the $8.99 plan
Because right now I think I have like the $12 plan
So I should at least just download the one movie a month plan
Or one disc at a time, four movies a month or whatever it is
Because I just never watch the movies they send
I just never get around to it
Like I'm always in the mood for something else by the time I get the movie
I'm just that impatient I don't know
Alright anyhow let's take a trip into the old mailbag
Darkstalker read one letter a little bit ago
But now we're going to officially open up the mailbag
For your emails at mailbag.orangelawandtrader.com
Darkstalker is going to pick out a few of her favorite emails
And read them for you right now
I get a ton of emails so I'm not going to be able to read all of them
But did you lose a sock so do you like Dan?
Dan was very popular on the show
I saw some twits about it too and all that so
Jenai from Las Vegas actually
Oh god stupid thing
Sorry my plug keeps falling on my laptop
I would like to say episode 312 was hilarious
Dan and Loki's commentary made me fall out of my suit laughing while at work
Dan needs to be on the show more often he's got a great radio voice too
I love the new LLR website layout it has a nice citrus look to it
Peace slot machines and sugar cookies Jenai
You know I had an offer to go to Vegas in June
And you know I can't go because it's the same week as E3
Damn it
I really want to go back to Vegas though I will make that happen this year
Well there's just some really really long emails
The next one comes up from AcidicVampire
Hello there OLR this is Paul aka AcidicVampire with my virginal email to you guys
I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm a fairly new listener
Been listening since August of last year
That I enjoy the show immensely
History between all three hosts the terrific news
And Loki's disdain for every Imagine game released each week has sold me as an avid listener
Imagine hate
Now that my saccharine praise is out of the way I do have a valid question
Now I've only heard Sky mention that he has played this game before
But if DarkSakuraLoki has played this as well I wouldn't mind their input
After years of being released I am finally going to attempt to play Final Fantasy XI
For some odd reason I've been reading about it lately
And I've always put it aside as being one of those games I just had to play
I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan Final Fantasy VI for the win
But I said cast Final Fantasy XI aside because it was online and required a monthly fee to play
Well I bought the Vanadium collection recently for about 20 bucks
Which includes all four expansion packs and I'm ready to get my feet wet and get my Ferraga on
This will be my first MMORPG which I fear will exile me from other players on the servers
Because of my inexperience which leads to this question
What tips can you give a noob MMORPG player like me?
I like to play a Taru Taru Black Mage because they're so damn cute
But I know it'll take forever to level them up
I also like to interact with other players but I don't want them excited on me just because I'm new to the game
They've been playing the game for five plus years
Any input you have
I'm sorry
Any input you or even the chat room can give me would be greatly appreciated
Thanks for your time and here's to another 300 shows
Gay gamers unite
I'll leave that to you, I played but I didn't like it
Yeah, turn around and run while you still can
Do not allow yourself to get sucked into this game
No, you know what, I've heard a lot's changed since the time I left
You know what, Loki actually, Loki did spend just as long as I did in the clutches of Vanadil if not a little longer
I don't know, Loki, what was your thoughts?
I liked it, it was fun
It sucked waiting for parties and now that they've fixed the having to party with people
I think that would be a lot more fun now
That was kind of the thing that broke it for me is, well other than that I didn't have time to play
Is just waiting for a party and you're like, okay I have two hours to play this
And of that two hours you're spending an hour and 45 minutes waiting for a party
And it's like by the time you're, it's like crap I don't have time to play anymore
Well 15 minutes of a party yay
Or you know someone else leaves and you have to wait for a party
Yeah I feel like I heard they changed a lot of very fundamental things about the game
Including the whole level sync thing that like I can't give this a fair shot
You know cause I could sit here and bitch about every reason why I left it
But I'm not giving the game a fair shot because they've addressed some of those issues
You know the economy was the biggest thing for me
I thought it was absolute bullshit that if you wanted to get anywhere in the economy of the game
You pretty much had to buy gold because they were refusing to do anything about the, or Gil or whatever
They were refusing to do anything about the Gil sellers in the game
But about three, four months after I left they finally started banning people for it
And they were pretty aggressive about it
Now granted you'll never eliminate it but I'm sure that's helped the economy tremendously in that game
Because the Gil sellers were ruining the game
But it's just unfortunate the Square let it go on so long
You know they didn't, kind of weren't, you know they lost some people like me
Because they just weren't more aggressive with it
So I don't know, I feel like I can't give the game a fair review
But dude you already bought the pack, it comes with a free month of the game
Go install it, have a blast, go play for that month
I'm almost curious to see how it would run on my PC now
Yeah I know, I bet it would look nice
But I don't know, you know one thing I prefer
I'll tell you something, to be fair I'll tell you something I prefer on Final Fantasy 11 compared to WoW
I like exploring in Final Fantasy 11 a lot more
And it's weird because the graphics aren't necessarily better
They're just a different type
And like when you go into a new world in Final Fantasy 11
Like a place you've never been before
It's like oh wow, it's scary as shit
Yeah sometimes it's scary as shit
Like especially the first time you're in Gunga mines and you hear the sirens go off
You're like what the fuck is that?
But you know, like Final Fantasy 11 you really get a sense of exploration in that game
And like just the world is so vast in that game
And it's not that WoW doesn't have its own neat levels and areas and things like that
But I don't know, there's something about Final Fantasy 11
Where I feel more sense of an accomplishment when it comes to exploring
WoW takes itself more seriously I think
Versus, you know, or not WoW takes
Final Fantasy 11 takes itself more seriously than WoW
So, hitstun asked in chat so what happened to make WoW suck now
Actually WoW doesn't suck
I don't have a problem with WoW at all
But I just had to quit because I just was spending too much time on it
Or take a vacation, I don't want to say I quit
Because that makes it sound like I'm never going to go back
And that's not the case, I'm actually probably going to go back pretty soon
But I just needed a break to do other things
So, hooray
Alright, next email then
Next email
Hey O.L.R. I have a request for the new Gamestop hate board
They don't sell classic games or system anymore
I was too young when they did and I got into classic gaming
They send them off to the warehouse to gather dust
So F you to Gamestop for lack of classic video games
How dare they call themselves a game store, that's from Cheeseburger
Good suggestion
Unfortunately the white board is down for repairs right now
But we will definitely add that when it comes back
Alright, one from Spassinator and then I'm going to read the long long one after that
Alright
Hi folks, I'm writing in today with a few questions and comments
Firstly, although perhaps not a big deal
But I'll address it anyway
I'd like to apologize for the mess of an email that it sent last week
With the poor grammar and spelling, don't worry about it
I'm giving a hard time
Normally I take the time to make sure everything is correct
But considering that I was typing in a hurry
And the fact that play online has no spell check
And the fact that my glucose levels were out of whack at the time
Side note, I'm diabetic and abnormal
Glucose levels cause me to get confused
But I'll end up being a factor in the issue
I really, I give everybody a hard time
It's not serious
She's an equal opportunity offender
Oh, bite me
Now that issue's out of the way, here's a few questions
One, can you recall any events in your lives or wow moments
That basically you had
You think to yourself something along the lines of yes, video games is a hobby
That I want to get into
For me it's the first time I set foot into a showbiz pizza place
Formerly a competitor of Chuck E. Cheese's
They're actually owned by Pizza Time Entertainment
That was started by
Fuck
I don't think it was started by fuck
Nolan Bushnell
I just want to let you suffer a little bit before I help you
It was going to my friend's house
No shit, cause I was little in indie games
I was born playing video games practically
I just played a lot of Odyssey 2 when I was little little
And I never thought about wow, I'd like to do this as a hobby
It just sort of happened
I was a little kid when all of this was new and interesting
But it was just more like
Hey look, mom brought home a clique-o-vision, that's cool
Oh, I'm going to go play kicks during break at school
It just didn't factor in as a wow
It was a part of my life, always
Not a big deal
Rob?
I'm sorry, what are we answering?
What was your wow, I really like video games?
What got you into video games pretty much?
Oh god
I'm almost in the same boat
I just remember the day we hooked up the Atari 2600
Just the fact that I was interacting with it
No, it really was the Commodore 64
I think, that really got me into games
I don't know, the games
I can't remember a single moment because I was so young
You don't remember a lot when you're 4 or 5
But I've just always been playing Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 games
And just been having a good time with the game
You know, maybe, I don't remember Dark Sakura's upbringing stories
But I know in my particular situation
My brother and sister are much older than I am
14 years and 16 years older than I am
So I was kind of an only child, not really
But one reason I played video games is because
I didn't have other kids to set up and play board games with
Or, you know, go out and play on the lawn with
I mean, granted, I had neighborhood friends and stuff
They don't want to hang out every day
So, you know, video games were a way to pass time
You know, it would entertain me
There were not always a lot of other people around
If that makes sense
So, Loki, anything for you?
Why are you into video games?
I don't know, because I always played video games
I know, it's tough
I don't want to say, it's just a tough question
There's nothing, really
Just having video games from like when I was 4 or 5
You know, that pretty much
That'll do it
So there you go
You look at the stuff you did when you were a little kid
You end up looking at it now
And you're doing the same stuff
You know, I liked tinkering with things
And playing video games
And messing around on a computer
And sure enough, I'm doing the same damn stuff now
We were just all born with a controller in our hand, apparently
So there you have it
Alright, now for the long, long, long, long, long email
Actually, there's more of this, sorry
I think I'm just going to post the long email
On the forums again, sorry for the cop-out
My throat hurts
So I'll finish this one
Have you ever played any memorable games that are so incredibly bad
In a weird sort of way that ended up being good?
Yes
Driver 3
Driver 3 is the best, worst game ever
It's just so bad
In fact, I was talking with my sister yesterday
About that, and she's like, I gotta go back and play Driver 3 again
She would basically just play the game
Drive around, do like stupid shit
And then watch the replay
Because the best part about it
The game was so glitchy anyways
That the replays were funny
But sometimes the replays would even glitch out even more
So your character would do really crazy stuff
But yeah, Driver 3
Absolutely a horrible game
That's funny to play
That don't shit your pants game was pretty bad, but funny
That was the one I played on Flash
That was the one I played on Flash
Logie had mentioned last week
I don't know, I can't think of a lot of console games that I go
Wow, that game was bad
Bejeweled
But yeah, I love Bejeweled
But Bejeweled's not a bad game, it's a great casual
Well, no, it's like Tetris
It's like a puzzle game, it's not a bad game
Did you see that they're bringing Bejeweled Twist to DS?
Yeah, but I'll be more interested when Bejeweled Twist is free to play on the website
Like all the other games
Also, I will get Pagle on Xbox Live Arcade
When it comes out
Definitely, definitely
But right now it's all about Bejeweled Blitz on Facebook
But nobody else, I have the shitty team score
Because nobody else plays every week like me
But I try to get a new score every week
So
If you do play, you should add me on Facebook
Because I need a higher team score, so there you go
Well, um
The third part of this email
Yep
In your opinion, what are the odds of releasing Final Fantasy
11 for
one or more of the current gen systems
I know they're really big on re-releasing
the other Final Fantasy games
So are they re-releasing Final Fantasy 7
So re-releasing Final Fantasy 7 should be a no-brainer
Although not everyone
may agree on this
Final Fantasy 7 is possibly
the most popular, I think it meant
re-releasing Final Fantasy 7
Because I was gonna say, 11's already on 360
Final Fantasy 7 is probably the most popular
memorable game of the series
So re-releasing that game would seem like a virtual
license to print a shit ton of money
Who wouldn't want free money, you know
Well thanks for reading and answering this email
Sorry it's so long
Um
I'd play it
I'm kinda torn
Yes they should, but I'd rather they just freakin' finish
Final Fantasy 13, like I'm also interested
in some of the new directions that Final Fantasy
is going. I wish they would have released
Final Fantasy 12 on the Playstation 3
and not the PS2, because I never finished it on PS2
And I think if it had
been on the newer consoles, I would have
probably spent more time with it. I know that seems so
silly, but that's what it is
So
There you go, I don't know, Loki you think they ought to re-release 7?
No
It's a classic the way it is. I think they do need
to just put it out on the download thing already
on Playstation Network
That I think they need to do
Um, just wait until 13 comes out
they may do that
Yeah, I could see that
But then again, why wouldn't you at least do it a couple months
in advance so people can play through Final Fantasy 7
before 13 comes out?
Because it doesn't tie really
with each other, it's just a really
uber Final Fantasy game that
goes along with another uber Final Fantasy game
Well you know there is that whole, and GameGuru
says this in chat, hopefully if not a remake they put it on
PSN or Steam, kind of the same thing I'm thinking of
The last remnant of course we heard is coming
to Steam, which implies the whole Square
partnership with Steam now. Hopefully
they will release some of the old PC classics
on Steam, but we'll see
I don't know, I'm not going to hold my breath
Didn't Eidos
put them out? Didn't Eidos
do the ports for PC?
I could be wrong, I didn't play them
Slightly better
graphics, eh, I don't know
Not sure if I want to play these
Last email? Yes
This one's long. Alright
Dear Rob, Jamie, and Matt, I've been
a long time listener of your show and counted among my favorites
In fact, when you do miss
a show infrequently as it is
leaves me feeling out of place
as if I've gone to work wearing just one sock
Your unique mixture of news commentary
and charm are an important part of my week
This is my first letter to you, so I thought
I'd start out by thanking you all
thanking
you for all you've provided during the years
As an older gamer like yourselves
I'm not older, okay, I'm kidding
Maybe a little
I understand the difficulty in trying to balance work, family
and the passion we feel for our hobby
Add a weekly show with
pre and post production on top of that and I'm amazed
you've been at it for as long as you have
Anyway, enough of me gushing
So are we!
But no, thank you, that means a lot
Recently I came across a comment made by
John Kohler, head of Sony PSP hardware marketing
in North America, which suggested that
the majority of Nintendo DS's
are purchased
by or for 12 year olds
Obviously this was meant to insult the DS
handheld fan base
But that aside, how much of the
statement is true?
It's up for data on Nintendo demographics
as they break down by age group and have a hard time
finding any recent results
Most comments are anecdotal, with an equal number
of people saying they see
more PSP's to DS's
among their above
12 age group, as exist folks
insisting there are more DS's
in their circle. The closest I
came to anything was an article on
GayGamer.net
from 2007, reporting that
according to the NPD
Nintendo had increased their sales figure among women
by 42%, 127%
among people who age 30
and older, and 212%
among people 35 and older
I don't know if that's just for the
month of April or if it was since the last study
had been made. I know
maybe this really isn't that big of a
deal, but I'm curious to know if these
assertions have any factual base
Kohler's claim just doesn't seem right to me
I
completely disagree with Kohler
I think that, you know, I see
more people who have
DS's than they do
PSP's. Now I'm seeing
more guys in their
early 20's who have PSP's
that I will say, but
you get it 25 and up
you know, and you get kids and
all kinds of, I think more people
and more families
have a DS
that's how I see it, like
my brother and sister-in-law
Dan's brother and sister
they each have their own DS
so, I mean
now they're little, but then again
you know, my
you know, I know tons of people who
are my age, you know, back
you know, where I'm from, who all have
DS's, you've got
well, you don't have PSP DS
No, I own both. I bought a PSP when they first came out
Luminous. I was all about Luminous. I bought a
PSP just for Luminous, practically. But I know
that all of us in this room
own both
Dan and I each have our own DS
We're a little different too
We're crazy, but I would say you're right
I think generally, you see
the college boys probably have the PSP
and are using it, you know, as their multi-device
which is what the PSP does best, like MP3's and all that stuff
but, so like, if you were to look at
demographics, like different
demographics, I bet if you looked at the sales figures
like males age 18 to
24 who own a PSP and DS
it's probably a little closer
to even, I bet DS still outdoes it though
it's probably a lot closer to even
than any other demographic you look at
but when you look at things as a whole, especially
with the DS aggressively targeting women
the way it has been with the
lifetime commercials, Carrie Underwood
pink DS's, all this stuff
you know, and as much as you want to
point and laugh at these Imagine games
and the cats and all this stuff, it works
they're selling, or they wouldn't
make them, you know, they're
just selling to your little sister
or, you know what I mean, they're just not
selling to people that probably listen
to this show, if that makes sense
so, you know
it's working, but
the PSP does not have a lot
for that
same casual
I don't eat, live, sleep, breathe
games, but I like to enjoy a game once in a while
market, there's not a lot of
great puzzlers, casual games
outside of Luminous, the movie
thing didn't work out so well
so unless you have somebody that really wants
that all in one system, and I don't know
if you held up, like if I
were a parent, you know, who didn't know better
and you held up a PSP
and you held up a DS and said which is more
durable for my seven year old child
I would go with the DS because it
closes and it protects the screen, the PSP
just looks flimsier
that makes sense, and sometimes
it's little things like that
that sell the system
you'd be surprised
there's more
me
they actually said, I should add that I'm a DS
owner over 12
I do not own a PSP currently, but would
eagerly buy one should any of the rumors
regarding the PSP2 second analog stick
be realized
I own both a 360 and a PS3
and enjoy them equally
in an ideal world, all three companies will do well
and continue to provide quality entertainment for the gaming
public, so what do you think
in this comment just so much as Claptrap or is it
or is he right, and must all
adult DS owners hang their heads in
shame for being attached to a kiddie
system, I obviously say that in jest
as long as the games are fun
what does it really matter, how much fun can
we have even with a Speak and Spell bottle of vodka
and grown up vocabulary
hey, I'm not gonna say I
don't know
in closing
I want to add that I like the new site
design, it's been a long time coming
but it looks sweet and seems to load
faster than the old one
nice decision to keep the
orange background too, if I have a
complaint it's that the episodes on iTunes seem
to be a week or two off
last week's episode was from February 8th
does that mean that this week's show will be available March 16th
or later, no it's getting caught up
I was having some problems because now
when I do a podcast I have to do it in
two different places as opposed to before
so it was just confusing me a little bit
but I'm good now, I got
another one up today and another one
is edited and ready to go and then we'll be all caught up
so I'm excited
and I know I keep saying we're all gonna get caught up
but then the new site kind of threw that all out of whack
but it's a good thing, I mean overall
it's a great thing, so and we're
getting back on track
um, did I already
yeah, okay
well keep up the good work
in the meantime, loyal listener Raymond
PS, I too quit WoW after
two years, one level 80
two level 70s
I don't regret the time
I spent there but the opportunities are now open to me
to experience all
different kinds of gaming from Dragon Quest 5 to
Flower to Gears of War 2, it was liberating
and daunting, that's an interesting combination
so many new games
so many old games to catch up on
and only so many hours available in the day, I'm still
open to MMOs though, maybe one of the
superhero games or the Star Wars one will
entice me back, it all depends on the community
play Star Trek with us!
You know, um, that closing
statement is pretty much essentially
the reason, one of the big reasons why I
quit WoW right there, is that it's now
allowed me to play other games
you know what I mean?
Same type of deal dude, I probably would never
play Flower or some of these other games I've been playing
if I had a raid to do
tonight, you know what I mean? So
yep
I just don't want to be tied
to an MMO the way I'd be tied
to like, my job
exactly, exactly, and I don't think
you know, it's not like I was in one of those guilds
I was in a very very casual guild, but I was
I was being too aggressive with the raiding and stuff
and I just needed to cut back
you know, and just keep WoW as a casual game like
others, make WoW like
Bejeweled basically, alright
if you want to send an email, mailbag
at orangeloungeradio.com is the place
to do it, we're going to take your calls in
just a little bit, but first we have a few more
quick stories for you guys, and then we'll get
to the Skype line and
get towards closing out our show
for tonight, so Loki!
There is some new download content
for a rather old Command & Conquer
game, Command & Conquer Generals
is getting a brand
new download
pack, I guess it's
Black Sheep, The Lost Mission
and
it's
interesting that this game
you know, it's from like 2003
and they're doing some download content
for it now
didn't even know they were still
working on that game
might have been something that just wasn't quite done
and then they're just like, okay let's finish this
and go
but yeah, it's available to download now
very small download, so
check it out I guess
basically the mission, you're giving
I guess, given the command of a
toxin attractor
it's a modified farm vehicle
that sprays
icky green stuff
and you're
supposed to crop dust a town
that's been corrupted beyond salvation
huh, it's interesting
they're releasing download content for such an old game
though, but it's still popular, I mean, yeah, right
it's like Starcraft still getting patches
all these years later
well there's still a lot of people playing it, I don't know about
Command & Conquer Generals, but that's neat
you know what I have an odd urge
to play, like I was just feeling
this the other day, Diablo 2
like, I don't know why
but there's still people that hella play that game too
I just like, really want to play Diablo 2 for some reason
but I don't, I used to
have it a long, long time ago
but I can't find the CD
which sucks, because if I could
then I could enter in that code on Blizzard's website
or whatever now and just download it I think
ugh, oh well
anyhow, sorry Random
Final Fantasy was a game we were talking about a little bit
earlier ago, and you know what's kind of
funny, I think we were talking about this a lot when we were talking about
video games live as well, is that the whole Squeenix
likes to protect their stuff
and they don't want their images shown
well, they don't want folks to
knock off their Final Fantasy products either
apparently they filed a
federal lawsuit
against
Edgework Imports, Top Swords,
Wholesale Gallery, Pacific Solutions Marketing
$600,000 judgment
and they are no longer allowed to make
fake Final Fantasy goods
whether it be inside their own stores or doing it on
eBay and Amazon
the defendants altogether issued a joint
statement saying that they regret
that they have sold these copies to consumers
and they would have never imported
the stuff in the first place if they knew that Squeenix
would respond so aggressively to stop them
they will never make this mistake again
sorry
I bet you anything this Final Fantasy 13
poster we have in studio, you can probably barely see it
on Justin.tv, but right there where I'm pointing
it's behind the new penguins thing
that poster is a Final Fantasy 13
poster and I bet you anything
it's a bootleg
of course it's a bootleg
it's probably from one of these companies that just got the
$600,000 judgment
I like what darktatsuya says in chat
$600,000 judgment sounds like a game
might be like a new limit break in Final Fantasy 13
who knows
so if you are counterfeiting Final Fantasy
products and selling them for your own profit
you might want to stop
before you get the next Smackdown
so I don't know dark soccer are you forging any
Final Fantasy goods?
no
alright well then you have nothing to worry about
but how about another story?
well I could do that
Xbox Live Arcade Awards
oooh
so basically you can
vote and voting stops
on Tuesday March 10th
the voting starts on March 3rd
so you've got that window to cast
your vote for what you like best
so we've got
here's your I guess sort of virtual sample ballot
best overall arcade game
is Braid Castle Crashers
Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2
Street Fighter 2 HD Remix
or Portal Still Alive
best original game would be
Castle Crashers and Plus
Braid Penny Arcade Episode 1
Schizoid Age of Booty
best family game

and Res HD
so go cast vote then
vote for Res HD a lot but at the same
time I don't think our listeners should be
voting in this poll because you know why
and I have a right to say this because I'm looking at
the OLR March Madness thing going on
and apparently Tetris is currently beating
Super Metroid which is stupid
and I know this is happening mostly
in part to the whole debacle from last year
I knew this was going to happen people want their revenge
on me nah nah nah nah nah but you know what
if you're one of the people
that voted Tetris over Super Metroid
please do not vote in this poll because
you obviously don't know what you're talking about
dear people stop listening to
Rob the end
I thought I'd
say something controversial alright
couple more news stories and we're going to get your calls
on our skype line 1877 game
OLR
I got to vote for
Tetris now you're such an asshole
nah I'm just kidding I'm not
I am not voting for Tetris because
you know what as much as I like
Tetris Super Metroid
gets my vote
good job
Super Metroid pulls ahead
alright good job
high five Loki
alright anyhow
couple more news stories and we're going to wrap up tonight
Loki sorry
that's alright I understand
more Grand Theft Auto possibly
on the PSP apparently
Sony is in talks with Rockstar
they want some more games for their PSP system
and you know what I'm down with that
let's get some San Andreas stories going on
um
apparently they're interested to see how
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars does
um you know cause
for a while there you know they have
the exclusive rights to the
handheld stuff now
you know the DS getting its own version of
the you know Grand Theft Auto series
uh oh
so uh be interesting to see
I know both of the PSP titles were
you know best sellers on
the console so
be very interesting to see how
Chinatown Wars does
but be honest I mean the Chinatown Wars
stuff it's going to be good but it's
no PSP Grand Theft Auto games
those were you know just like the
PlayStation 2 ones and um
I hope they do another one
I really don't
but is Grand Theft Auto the type of thing you really want to play on your PSP
Loki I mean you're a Grand Theft Auto fan
we played the PSP version for months
the multiplayer was fun
and yes
it is something I would play on my PSP
for long hours
and it's also fun to hack
apart
for long hours I'd like to see a Saints Row
on PSP but no that
wouldn't happen or even like Crackdown on PSP
that'd be awesome anything sandbox-ish
hell Atari
or Ubisoft or whoever owns Driver
make another Driver game
you don't have to put any effort into it
just make another Driver game make it crap like the last one
make it very cr- well their last game
I didn't really play but make it like Driver 3
just reissue Driver 3
make no changes
alright and uh finally
tonight um this is
something interesting apparently a
60 year old woman
got held hostage at gunpoint
for 10 hours in Brazil
um this week this is reported from
globo.com apparently
broke this story but here's the part
that makes it interesting and somewhat game
related um the gun
that was used a Sega
light phaser from the old Sega
Master System of course
Sega is still a huge presence in Brazil
the Master System is still marketed in Brazil
that's right so uh you know no surprise that
uh the Sega light phaser
uh was the light gun of choice however
uh do try to hold somebody
up with a light gun
and they didn't figure out
that this was a fake looking gun
60 year old woman
uh the man did uh release the
hostage good for him negotiated
with police and uh
there you go so
I
don't know idiots like this uh anybody
that uses video game equipment to hold people
hostage deserves to have
the FUs of the week dedicated to them

around and of course the first game he highlighted
of course La Mulana
cause I know he's just dropped
thousands and thousands of hours into the
MSX wannabe game

it through after like two weeks I know it's been
kind of crazy the past couple weeks but that's okay
you know we have to take calls from different people you
know we gotta mix it up a little bit what's on your mind
Ron yeah there sky I
want you to know something what
you almost killed me about
two hours ago how
your comment
about foodie monster I was eating
chips and drinking soda when you said
that the sad thing is I don't
even think he's listening tonight but um
he's not and no one's made a comment
to twitter about it to him either
hopefully somebody will bring it to his attention
that he ought to listen to tonight's show
cause I'm sure I'll get a nasty twitter email about
it if
no one else does it I will
alright you get to it hey
no cons this weekend
um I'm done with the cons for
the month I did comic con I did
catacon I did wicked winter
ren fair I'm on break until the end
of March oh nice
long break for you
something like that have you speaking of cons
have you been to video games live it's like a mini
con not yet when it
came around my way I just didn't have the money
and to be perfectly honest I wasn't
really that interested at the time you know
I would say they do a costume contest
and there were only like three people
that dressed up so like if you did
your black luigi thing or heck any of your
video game related costumes I think you'd have a good
shot to win like a DS or something like that
I'll check that out you should
I bet you could do very well
yeah and speaking of like
conventions when you talked about the square enix
swords it would not be surprising
that I still see them at the conventions
or whatever's left the price would just
go double the triple for some odd
believe it or not they're cheaper than getting them
done commissioned by actual
prop makers probably
probably
is this true I see Breslull
in chat are saying you are going to sakura con
true or false no I'm not
oh
I kind of want to go to sakura con
I love seattle but I also want to go to packs
so I don't know and flights
aren't always necessarily
that cheap but I don't know I might be able
to come to sakura con
maybe if Breslull will let me
crash his place on the couch or something
as long as you don't violate
him in his sleep I promise
I'll be good
and um last week you guys
he can't violate me in my sleep why are you telling
me he needs to not violate me
he would
be the one to do that
gs68 says come to faname
dammit I'm almost positive I'll
be at faname this year in fact we need to talk about
orange launch radio panel I think that is happening
I don't know so we'll
figure it out
wow
um I want you guys to know that
you guys covered an article
last week that you covered
like 3 years ago
you know sometimes those oddities
happen but what was the article just for fun
final fantasy 10 port
on the nes
really that had come up before I thought it was
recent I remember there was a 7
port on the ds a few years ago
that final fantasy 7 but I didn't remember
a 10 port so that's why
it was a 10 because someone
posted I followed the link and I'm like
this is 10 yeah
interesting well it happens
whatever you know we're not
perfect and the show's been going a long
time we can't remember
every story we've ever done it's gonna happen
that's fine I mean I was
I had no problem with that that was pretty cool

game OLR our username on skype
orange lounge radio apparently
super mario kart according to
guinness book of world records
has compiled the top 50 console
games of all time
and super mario kart apparently
has the longest legacy
and the biggest impact on video games
in all of history and that is according to again
the guinness book of world
records they need to get out of video games
number 2 tetris 3 grand theft
auto 4 super mario world
zelda green of time at number 5
all the way down to outrun 2 at number
50 it's like seriously guinness
no one gives a shit about your book anymore
hey i love guinness when it's booze
actually yes i give a shit about their book anymore
so sorry you're wrong
but even about video games?
yes actually
i think that it's fantastic that they're
still keeping track of all of this i think it's great
well i beg to differ
if they're still using twin galaxies to do it
but we'll save that another night
not using twin galaxies but i mean
but i still think that the
guinness book is fantastic
thanks for the call waiting on the line
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
hi this is spazzinator
hi spazzinator what's on your mind
um two things
um i just want to say thank you to
loki for showing off
nobody boy last week
uh thanks to him
showing off the folders
i ended up buying the game
uh during the middle of the week
it's actually quite fun
so uh thank you to him
we did some mixed reviews on that
so i'm glad to hear you liked it after all
no problem we tried to do that now that we've got the
justin tv thing hooked up pretty cool where
you know even though i think watching
a radio show being taped is the most boring thing
in the world at least the audio now
goes out over justin tv really well
and um you know we do those little breaks
in between that seem to work out really well
for the audience over there so and it
you know it opens up our show to a new group of people
cause there's a whole vast
you know user base on justin tv
that would never think to seek out all games
dot com or orange lounge radio otherwise
so hey it works
and um
as far as the
second thing um i just wanted
to respond to that one email
that you read earlier today
i can't remember his name
but he was asking about
you know advice
regarding final fantasy
11 yeah
yeah basically
you know i agree with a lot
of your criticisms of
final fantasy 11 i know
the game is not perfect
by a long shot but still
it is pretty fun
um i've been playing for
just barely over 3 years now
um i would recommend
that this person
get into a good
link shell which is
you know the game is equivalent to a guild
um and there's
uh you know the game
is designed to be very social
um so even if
you're just sitting around waiting
to get into a party
you know you can always you know shoot the
breeze with your friends in the link shell
uh while waiting
spazzinator i think it's um
that's true about like almost any mmo
is that like if you ask people
why do you play this game so much like i would say
this about wow it's the people
the people and the community is always going to be
what brings you you know to the game
so you're absolutely right no matter what
mmo you're going to play if you play wow you
need a guild if you play 11
you need a link shell you know or the equivalent
of these things in other games here i'm going to
try to ask you a question here what
would you say is
the number one thing
that draws you to final fantasy 11
besides the people what is it about
final fantasy 11 the game that
keeps you coming back
well you know
i've been a
pretty big fan of the series
as a whole
for a number of years and i figured
you know at the time
you know this was the next one
in the series now get that started
uh not only that
but since i'm primarily a console
gamer now my
selection of
mmo's are kind of limited
uh the
only other one that i'm familiar with
and heard of is
the playstation 2
version of everquest
and that was alright
but in final
fantasy 11 in my opinion
is a whole lot better
um and
plus you know you can play as
a black mage you know which
both of my characters are
and it's just so
much fun nuking the shit out
uh the beastmen in
final fantasy 11 you know whether
you're casting fire or
arrow or
thunder or whatever
you know just like
uh doing you know
casually uh casting
spells you know every
2 or 3 seconds you know
alright
well you know um i can see that because
final fantasy 11 was kind of a console
game you know it was made for the playstation 2
i know a lot of people here in america play it on
pc but most people over in japan play it on playstation 2
and a lot of people here in america play
it on playstation 2 as well it is one of the few
mmos very accessible through a
console so you know i can kind of see that wow
wow is missing um a significant user
base from not having a version of it
on consoles but then again i couldn't see wow
on a console so i get it well spazzinator
we're gonna have to let you go so we can get some more calls but
um i hope your sales pitch works i'm sure it
will i'm sure he'll uh acidic vampire will at least
spend his one month in final fantasy 11
and hopefully he'll stay a little longer after that
so uh spazzinator thank you so much
for calling and have a good one okay
yep you too take care
alright alright
take care buddy
alright uh 1877
game o-l-r
uh our username on skype orange lounge
radio hi you're on orange lounge
radio who's this
dsmester25 well hello
dsmester what's up
uh not much
everything i got a few new games
i got a few new features on
okay you're you're i i don't know if
something's weird with the audio we're
getting it's a little hard to understand
may i want to get a little bit away from your mic
i don't know what's up with that no that's all right
um so you have some new games you want to review what's up what games
um gta
uh liberty city
and tony arx project 8
well tell us about them
well where we see stories
first time playing it even though
i'm only 16
i've been on amazon my debit card
um basically
what i like is if we play
it just for all humans but a lot more
i like rolling
around in the tank blowing stuff up
blowing
blowing stuff up in games is always fun
plus
the custom soundtrack option even though it comes
up in your safe house as corrupted
which is
weird but uh you can put
except it's very complicated to
put them into tsc and then put them
to that gta
for your songs
it's kind of cool though
so what was the other game you played besides grand theft auto
tony arx project 8
tell us a little more about
this game i don't this one's not ringing a bell
for some reason
basically it's like
all your tony arx games but a little bit more
of a challenge um
basically you had to keep
pushing up to keep your
skater going there is no auto kick option
whatsoever in the game
what game is this
what game is this
tony arx project 8
ok yeah now i understand
ok cause like when it was coming through
was it just me i couldn't understand what he was saying before
ok now i get it
so um
ok so is this a game
worthy of the tony arx series or is it
you know kind of average or what
um
it's a little bit more challenging i will say
it's going to be more of a challenge
for me
what makes
this game
different from the other tony
arx games
like
basically um
more area to explore
it's like a free realm
um game kind of like
american wasteland which the psp
never got
um because the ds
got american wasteland but
the ds never got project 8
and uh actually there is
another game i got
rock revolution for ds
that must be uh
that must be
interesting rock revolution on the ds
i know we had a review on that a couple weeks ago
i think sauce reviewed it i'm still tempted
to get it for 20 bucks on 360
i'm like oh that's 20 dollars i could like
buy lunch
actually the uh ds version
has the singing in it
which the consoles are missing
that is so weird but of course
the ds has the built in microphone
yeah
even though here's my little problem
here was when i've been on the psp
i mean why didn't her
mics just go with what um
activision did
and basically redo
the guitar grip but to fit the USB
port in a clamp on
because that one made sense
for a guitar grip
hmm
could be
alright
well um we are going to
um go ahead and wrap up
and let you go but uh keep having fun with
the ds games
so uh you know have fun
alright i love the psp
and uh it's actually awesome but
i just got a new screen
so i just need to fix the buttons now
alright
alright take care buddy
peace out see ya
alright
ok that was um
ds master calling in
and uh
that's going to do it for the skype line tonight
thank you guys so much for the uh calls
and sorry to those that didn't get through apparently it's been
popular the past couple weeks but we will open
it up again next week as we always do don't forget you can always
send in an email or post something on the
forums etc
etc uh
alright let's go around and get everybody's final
thoughts and then we're going to close up shop
oh last minute stories though first did we get
any was there anything else i had the one
uh guinness thing uh
logi yeah there's a few things
real quick um there was
uh the announcement this week
or they finally made it
you know official that the
red xbox 360
elite system with resident evil
5 will be making its way
to stores at the same time as
the game by itself um
the system of course would be just like
your normal elite system except it's
going to be all red um
as well as there's going to be a red
uh controller to go along with it
you're going to get a
an exclusive resident evil 5 theme
and also a um
copy of super street fighter 2
turbo hd remix
as well as of course a resident evil 5
all that for the
low low price of $399.99
or just the normal price of an elite system
so um
pretty good deal if you were looking to buy an elite
system
and um the other thing
um that's supposed to be worked on right
now is apparently it is expected to
sign a deal for doom 4
um later this year
however they don't know who the publishers
going to be yet but you better believe
that you're going to see a doom 4
I wouldn't be surprised if it was EA
but you know
I don't know
doom 3 was kind of eh it was alright
and then
that's it
alright
well uh I guess that's going to do
it for tonight's show
let's go around and get everybody's last
final thoughts um my final
thought would be I should
really play this copy of every extend extra
I have sitting here in front of me
find my psp cause this is a great game
I love it on the xbox live arcade
but I didn't play it enough on psp I think
I'm going to do that this week dark soccer

is I've got a lot of games to play this week
