0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto.
14000	19000	Tonight, July 12, 2009. Can piracy lead to malware on your DS?
19000	21000	The Tomb Raider franchise looks ready for a reboot.
21000	27000	And could you soon play Rock Band or Guitar Hero with no gaming console?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello, Internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	42000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	47000	And here to do it with you guys every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host.
47000	50000	Joining me tonight, the one and only tech master, Loki, in the house.
50000	51000	Hello.
51000	52000	How you doing, Loki?
52000	53000	Doing good.
53000	54000	Awesome.
54000	57000	And DarkSakura is joining us a little bit late.
57000	62000	She is in her summer class right now, and as you know, she's been having to join us late for some of the shows
62000	66000	because she has some type of outdoor activity she has to do.
66000	72000	Some type of PE class, so she, I think, some type of class she has to do outdoor activities for.
72000	74000	She'll probably tell us more about that when she comes on.
74000	77000	She should be live with us in about 15 minutes, so not too long.
77000	80000	I know she wasn't here last week, so we have a lot of DarkSakura catching up to do.
80000	85000	And then, of course, you guys join us every week in our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
85000	88000	Our phone line is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
88000	91000	Our email bag, mailbag, orangelaungeradio.com.
91000	93000	It's not just about us, it's about you guys.
93000	95000	We are the place where every gamer has a voice.
95000	99000	Anyhow, it's been a fun week, I hope, for you guys out there.
99000	103000	Just another summer week for those of you folks that are on a break from school or what have you.
103000	106000	I hope you're making the most of it and getting some good gaming time in.
106000	110000	We're going to start off the show tonight, as we always do, talking about our gaming weeks a little bit.
110000	112000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
112000	118000	I was just playing Grand Theft Auto IV, just still tweaking the editing to make sure everything's balanced.
118000	128000	I was creating one weapon that's basically a nuke, and it wasn't getting to the size that a nuke should be.
128000	136000	Or at least, you know, relatively in scale. Obviously, if I actually created a full-sized nuke in the game,
136000	139000	that would kind of be pointless since it would destroy the entire map.
139000	147000	But I want something a little bit bigger than, say, 20 square feet or something like that.
147000	151000	So I'm working on making that a little bit bigger. I think I figured out a way to do it.
151000	160000	But it's funny, because we just can't stop giggling once we fire that, and the whole screen gets this big bright green glow,
160000	164000	and everything explodes, and it's funny.
164000	174000	But yeah, the game has gotten so ridiculous now that it's just an absolute blast, and really kind of not resembling Grand Theft Auto anymore.
174000	181000	Now, you talk a lot about your Grand Theft Auto playing on the show, and I think we all kind of have the grasp
181000	183000	that you do this on your lunch break at work. This is how you guys...
183000	185000	Lunch break and our 15-minute break.
185000	190000	Wow, so it's all gaming. Because, again, for those folks that are new to Orange Lancerado and maybe haven't listened before,
190000	196000	Loki works in game distribution, so he literally for eight hours a day kind of eats, lives, sleeps video games.
196000	203000	But it's not as glamorous as some of you might think, because he's actually selling video games to little independent stores.
203000	208000	Not GameStops, but independent video game stores, right? So you're kind of like the middleman there.
208000	212000	So you have to be a salesman. But instead of selling used cars, you're selling new video games.
212000	218000	So, all right. A wild dark soccer is approaching. Quick, throw the pester ball!
218000	222000	She just got out of the shower.
222000	228000	All right, she'll be joining us in just a moment. Anyway, she came in to make faces in the studio.
228000	234000	Yeah, so you play actual video games on your lunch break to kind of decompress and stuff, and the guys you play with,
234000	237000	are they all also like game salesmen, or what's the deal?
237000	241000	Well, here's the deal. One way or another, they sort of are.
241000	247000	I mean, before we used to have a mix, we had just all of our game reps playing.
247000	253000	Right now, we have myself, my friend Jason, who actually moved into the games department, so now he's a game sales rep.
253000	259000	Our friend Rob Nelson, who's in our video sales department, but way back in the day, he was actually in game sales,
259000	265000	and he likes games, so that's cool. And then my boss, Rob, who's also...
265000	267000	Wait, so you play video games on lunch with your boss?
267000	268000	Yeah.
268000	271000	That's actually kind of cool. Your job ain't so bad.
271000	274000	But I kick the crap out of him a lot.
274000	278000	Nice. I wish I could play Grand Theft Auto with my boss.
278000	279000	But the thing is...
279000	282000	Of course, I don't think she really plays video games.
282000	290000	No, because we play on the consoles that I own, I've modded all those consoles, so now I can take an image of Grand Theft Auto IV.
290000	299000	Granted, I have bought copies, so I guess sort of it's legal, because I do actually own enough copies for all the systems.
299000	304000	I actually have lost and damned on all the systems, so that's pretty expensive.
304000	312000	But yeah, so we actually do play modified copies of Grand Theft Auto IV, but we play with our own ruleset.
312000	319000	And really, since we're not playing with anybody else other than our group, we're not getting banned.
319000	326000	I mean, despite the rumors, oh, if you play with a modded console and a modded disc or a backup or something like that on Live, you're gonna get banned.
326000	332000	Well, we've been doing it for a while now, and really I think it takes someone reporting you and that kind of stuff.
332000	339000	But yeah, we're just having fun with our custom weapons, and I try to modify everything so that it's kind of balanced.
339000	343000	But it's just absolutely crazy, and I am planning on filming it this week.
343000	347000	I finally found my video capture device.
347000	349000	Thank God, because our YouTube needs a little love.
349000	352000	We put up a handful of videos from E3, but our YouTube could always use some more love.
352000	354000	I know we have our YouTube fans out there.
354000	357000	Yeah, so I'm gonna try to film it this week.
357000	363000	I just have to get enough footage to edit it together to make it interesting, but it's absolutely crazy.
363000	367000	It's seriously just explosions going off every which way.
367000	369000	Yeah, it's nuts.
369000	375000	Speaking of video, I just kind of want to get out there, because some folks that listen to Orange on this Radio have been asking,
375000	376000	when is Justin TV gonna come back?
376000	379000	The webcam feed that we used to have, when is that gonna come back?
379000	386000	Probably around Labor Day, and I know that's a way out, and I apologize to those folks that were relying on Justin TV to kind of listen to the show live,
386000	390000	because for whatever reason, I guess shoutcast ports are blocked, but they could get in through Justin TV.
390000	394000	We have some very naughty people who listen to us at work overseas.
394000	396000	Naughty, naughty, but no, we appreciate the support.
396000	398000	Either way, just don't get fired over Orange on this Radio.
398000	403000	But we have some folks that would listen, and I know they were using Justin TV to do it,
403000	406000	and some folks, for whatever weird reason, like to look at us while we're doing this,
406000	409000	but we would also play video games, usually during the show.
409000	414000	I know towards the end there, before the summer months, we would kind of show games before they were actually out,
414000	419000	because Loki is also a crazy import gamer, and would get a lot of games from Japan that he can play on his Wii,
419000	421000	so we were doing a lot of that.
421000	424000	So we are gonna bring that back, probably around Labor Day.
424000	426000	There's just some other things we have to answer.
426000	430000	We actually still have the donated computer as well, which is gonna help in large part with this,
430000	436000	because depending on where we end up, we're either gonna go to a larger space here in Studio Dark Sakura,
436000	443000	where all the pinball is now, or we're going to go back to Studio My Place, and the place that's there.
443000	446000	So either way, we're looking at getting a more intricate setup with Justin TV,
446000	451000	where we're gonna have a switchboard, where we can go between like a shot of us in studio,
451000	456000	a shot of the game we're playing, maybe something that's a zoom in on the guest or something like that.
456000	459000	Kind of some multi-camera angles, believe it or not, should be interesting.
459000	462000	So we'll see what happens. That is hopefully in the future.
462000	466000	Anyway, I didn't mean to derail your gaming week, Loki, but I don't know if you have anything else.
466000	471000	Death Wishing says I should make a gun that shoots fish. Can't do that, unfortunately, in Grand Theft Auto.
471000	475000	You can make guns that shoot a lot of things, but fish is not one of those things.
475000	478000	Tigerclaw is asking why not Studio Loki if it exists.
478000	483000	Well, I just think with babies on the way, Studio Loki's not really gonna be a viable option,
483000	486000	plus I don't think you have really any extra space there.
486000	488000	The middle bedroom, but it's kind of...
488000	491000	Small. Well, so is this space. We make this work.
491000	494000	Yeah, actually, it would be bigger than this space.
494000	499000	I think Studio Loki is always a possibility in a situation where one of us is gonna be gone or something,
499000	502000	but, you know, especially once Loki has the kids there.
502000	504000	I will have an HDTV in there, hopefully.
504000	507000	The wife keeps seeing that I can't put it in there. She's like, well, you have to put it in our bedroom.
507000	510000	I'm like, well, I don't have cable locks for that, so...
510000	515000	Dark Sakura is toweling off from the shower. In fact, she's wearing nothing but a towel right now.
515000	518000	Too bad that we don't have that Justin TV heft up, right?
518000	519000	Whatever.
519000	524000	No, she's not. She's wearing very unglamorous sweatpants and a DDR spot t-shirt.
524000	527000	These aren't sweatpants. These are actually comfortable man pajamas.
527000	531000	I'm sorry. From a distance, they look like sweatpants. Well, what's on your mind, Dark Sakura? How are you doing?
531000	539000	Well, I was actually gonna say we actually had another idea about doing some rearranging that would involve opening up a whole wall in this room.
539000	540000	Dang.
540000	549000	So that would give us... In fact, it was actually almost specifically for us using this as a studio full-time.
549000	550000	Nice.
550000	556000	So we would be making some more room in here. We're actually thinking about moving the pinballs into that room and moving our living room into the pinball room.
556000	563000	And for that sake, that actually moves the subwoofer away from that back wall so that we're not getting...
563000	567000	Oh, and by the way, Sega did BOOM!
567000	571000	I look forward to the week where Sega does BOOM!
571000	576000	That would be a great video game, actually. Just call it BOOM with an explanation.
576000	579000	Copyright Orange Jones Radio 2009, blah blah.
579000	582000	We haven't had a dream game in a long time called BOOM.
582000	583000	Or a dream game in a long time.
583000	585000	It just needs to be called subwoofer noise.
585000	591000	Well, Dark Soccer, since you're joining us now, welcome back, by the way. You were out last week because you were in Vegas. How was Vegas?
591000	592000	It was hot.
592000	593000	Of course.
593000	596000	And when it got hot, it got hotter. And then it was alright.
596000	601000	I had a very good time. We actually did have some rain coming back from the Hoover Darn.
601000	602000	Yeah?
602000	608000	Sorry, my little brother, Phillip. So cute when he was little. Then he grew up. What happened?
608000	612000	He used to call it the Hoover Darn because dam was a bad word.
612000	613000	Because dam's a bad word, right.
613000	619000	Yeah. So I sort of inherited calling it the Hoover Darn. But anyway, we went to the Hoover Dam.
619000	626000	And it was hot. And there was water.
626000	627000	And big.
627000	629000	I took pictures of said water.
629000	631000	Thank God you're here because I would have never known that.
631000	635000	Oh, whatever. God, where the hell is my IRC? Okay.
635000	643000	Anyway, we got lots of frozen yogurt. And I had a few very cool new experiences.
643000	651000	And met cool people that I had heard of but never got to see. So it was pretty cool. I had a very good time.
651000	654000	Wait, did you meet OLR listeners? Or were these like other people?
654000	655000	Other people.
655000	656000	Oh, okay.
656000	657000	Because I went to go see Sauce.
657000	658000	Okay. Because tiara friends.
658000	659000	Yeah.
659000	660000	Okay, okay.
660000	668000	And I had a really great, great time. It was very relaxing. I watched the first season of Dexter.
668000	675000	I love that show. I watched the first season of True Blood. I love that show, too.
675000	678000	And I finally got to see Repo, the genetic opera.
678000	679000	Yes.
679000	683000	God, I love Anthony Head and that. He's just like, oh!
683000	685000	I love Repo in general. Well, you know, if you're a long time-
685000	689000	And it's the only thing I've seen Sarah Brightman in that her voice hasn't irritated me.
689000	695000	Oh, she's amazing. By the way, if you've listened to this show for any length of time, or I guess I should say a long time,
695000	698000	you know that I've been involved with Rocky Horror Picture Show for a long time.
698000	708000	And Repo really is kind of like a lot like it in a sense where it's that very like kind of glamorous kind of musical type thing.
708000	710000	So I love Repo. It's awesome.
710000	717000	I really do. I really do enjoy it. I'm gonna have to pick that up on Blu-ray so I can watch it in all the HD glory.
717000	722000	I have an extra copy on Blu-ray if you want to buy one cheap because I got an extra one for my birthday.
722000	723000	Alright.
723000	724000	So if you're interested in it, let me know.
724000	725000	I'm interested in it.
725000	726000	Okay, cool.
726000	734000	But I also actually did a little bit of gaming. I actually brought some games that we never got to play.
734000	744000	But I got my SNES emulator running on Linux and I played some of the game that we'll be talking about later.
744000	746000	I see. So we're gonna have an inspired Classic Game of the Week this week.
746000	747000	Yes, we will.
747000	748000	Awesome.
748000	754000	And it's not Captain America and the Avengers. We did purchase that actually. Dan and I did when I got back.
754000	757000	Goldanthro in our chatroom at chat.orangelawnsradio.com put,
757000	762000	Lol, my mom is watching True Blood right now in my family's living room. No joke. She loves that show.
762000	763000	Dad, that show's awesome.
763000	767000	True Blood is also a trending topic on Twitter right now, I notice, since I'm checking the OLR accounts.
767000	769000	So it must be a good show. I've never watched it.
769000	774000	It's pretty good. It's pretty good. It's just something you'll have to watch.
774000	776000	It's like vampires and stuff, right?
776000	778000	Yeah, but it's vampires going public.
778000	779000	Interesting. Okay.
779000	782000	It's got a lot of human rights parallels and different things.
782000	784000	So like heroes, but with vampires?
784000	785000	I didn't watch Heroes.
785000	786000	Oh, okay.
786000	789000	So that's kind of lost on me.
789000	795000	But we also saw Drag Me to Hell.
795000	800000	And we paid $2 apiece for it, so it was well worth the money.
800000	805000	It was like, I think either that or The Hangover, and I hate stupid-
805000	806000	Buddy comedies.
806000	809000	I really do. I really don't like those kind of movies.
809000	814000	And while other people may love them to death, that's fine. I'm not saying that your taste is awful.
814000	816000	I'm just saying that's not my kind of thing.
816000	822000	So, um, but going to see a Sam Raimi movie, you know, how can you go wrong with Sam Raimi?
822000	823000	Loki's dying to say something.
823000	825000	Oh, I was just going to say what I saw this week, too.
825000	832000	I saw Transformers Revenge of the Fallen and Bruno, and I never have I seen so many people walk out of Bruno.
832000	833000	It was hilarious.
833000	839000	I'm iffy on Bruno because I have this bad feeling I'm going to get really offended even though I usually find that kind of stuff funny.
839000	840000	It was funny.
840000	841000	I'm waiting for Blu-ray.
841000	842000	Natalie loved the movie.
842000	844000	Did she? Of course she did.
844000	845000	I'm just going to wait for Blu-ray.
845000	847000	There's so many other movies I want to see in the theater right now.
847000	848000	I have not seen Transformers.
848000	851000	The boyfriend talked me into seeing- actually it was a mutual agreement.
851000	855000	Like, because he wanted to see Transformers, but I was a little eh, and I wanted to see this other movie.
855000	864000	He was kind of a little eh, so we agreed to go see My Sister's Keeper, which is basically like the biggest, like, vagina of a movie ever.
864000	868000	It's a total chick film, and we just cried through the whole thing like big girls.
868000	870000	But, um, you know, it was good, I guess.
870000	871000	It was sad.
871000	874000	I showed you the picture of what I saw that made me think of you.
874000	876000	Oh, yes. What? The big pink penguin?
876000	878000	The pink penguin in a tutu?
878000	882000	I'm not sure how to take this, because, you know, sure, I'm gay or whatever, but I like to think I'm still a guy.
882000	884000	Because you like pink ones.
884000	885000	I do love pink ones.
885000	886000	Actually, I'll tell you why it made me think of you.
886000	887000	Why?
887000	888000	Because of Rocky.
888000	889000	It's true.
889000	894000	When, when, um, he did the cell block, uh, pingo.
894000	896000	Oh, god, that was so many years ago.
896000	897000	Okay, yeah, yeah.
897000	898000	And you were wearing the little pink-
898000	904000	You know, you know, you're not helping my whole manly man case here, so if, uh, you wouldn't mind telling us about the rest of your gaming week.
904000	908000	But it wasn't, don't jump to conclusions.
908000	913000	Anyway, um, I played a lot of pinball.
913000	919000	We went to the pinball hall of fame, and, um, I was in pain by the time we were done, but it was well worth the agony.
919000	923000	Um, I played the worst pinball table ever, and it's also one of the most rare.
923000	925000	I played pinball circus.
925000	927000	It's crap.
927000	933000	It's worth playing once, but it's crap, and that's probably why they only made two of them.
933000	941000	Um, I played, uh, I actually went and played a really good, um, Black Knight, um, 2000.
941000	949000	Because, you know, I've got the table, but ours is kind of messed up, so playing on our messed up table here helped my skills on the really nice table there.
949000	960000	And we had, um, Tiara and I took turns, sort of, um, on the longest multi-ball session ever of Star Trek The Next Generation.
960000	966000	And I played the Data East Star Trek pinball. I played, um, I did not play Captain Fantastic, sorry.
966000	973000	Um, but I did play, um, Theater of Magic, and I played, um, Medieval Madness.
973000	981000	I played, um, the Super Mario Brothers pinball table. The adult one, not the child one.
981000	986000	Um, and I played, uh, Bride of Pinbot and Pinbot. They didn't have a jackpot.
986000	990000	I was actually, I wandered around the place twice looking for a jackpot, but they didn't have one.
990000	993000	But it's okay. They had, they had Doctor Who. I didn't play, though.
993000	995000	No, where is this place? I'm sorry, I missed that part.
995000	996000	It's the Pinball Hall of Fame.
996000	997000	Oh my god, awesome.
997000	999000	And we drove by the Liberace Museum.
999000	1002000	And all I could think of was, my mom would like this.
1002000	1004000	We didn't go there.
1004000	1010000	The plaza's like the Liberace Plaza, and there's a big circle thing on the marquee with his head on it.
1010000	1012000	I was like, heh, that's Liberace.
1012000	1016000	The boyfriend and I are thinking of going to Vegas, uh, before the end of the year.
1016000	1018000	So, I, I really want to go. I haven't been in like eight years.
1018000	1023000	He wouldn't want to go to some of these places you're talking about, but I'm sure I wouldn't want to go everywhere.
1023000	1026000	He wants to go either, so we can maybe have a day where we do our own things.
1026000	1027000	Go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.
1027000	1028000	Like, I want to see the Pinball Hall of Fame.
1028000	1030000	Go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.
1030000	1037000	And you have to eat at, um, this place that, um, that, uh, Tiara took me to called, I think it's Toto's.
1037000	1039000	That's like a margarita brunch.
1039000	1042000	Well, you know I'm going to go visit Sauce if I'm there and all that, so.
1042000	1045000	It's not on the strip. It's, we, we avoided the strip like a plague.
1045000	1048000	Well, I'll make Sauce take us out to all the nice places.
1048000	1049000	Yeah.
1049000	1050000	Anyhow, I don't want to-
1050000	1058000	It was, we had a very, very good time, and I got woken up by a kitten a lot.
1058000	1067000	But it was funny because, um, you know, I'm used to, to having Dan in the bed, and I'm used to rolling over and smacking him in the face or something.
1067000	1072000	And, you know, just rolling over and having him to, to go, oh, Dan's there, or, oh, Dan's not here.
1072000	1076000	And instead I was rolling over and like, oh, a kitten!
1076000	1078000	Oh, DVDs!
1078000	1080000	You know, so it was, it was pretty cool.
1080000	1090000	But I had a great time, and, um, I, I, you know, I have to, to thank, uh, her and her family for putting up with me for the time I was there.
1090000	1091000	I had a great time.
1091000	1092000	Excellent.
1092000	1093000	I'm glad you had fun in Vegas.
1093000	1097000	And now I know all the good stuff I need to go do, hopefully if I go visit before the end of the year.
1097000	1101000	But it's just, it's just making his schedule work and my schedule work, because he's going to art school now.
1101000	1102000	He starts art school Monday.
1102000	1103000	Really?
1103000	1104000	Believe it or not.
1104000	1108000	Yes, he's, you're going to have to forget that whole manly man thing I was mentioning earlier.
1108000	1110000	He's, he's studying to be an interior designer.
1110000	1111000	Cool!
1111000	1112000	No, I think that actually, I think that's awesome.
1112000	1114000	I would, I would love to sit down and talk with him.
1114000	1115000	I'm so supportive.
1115000	1116000	I'm so supportive.
1116000	1117000	It's, it's going to be awesome.
1117000	1121000	I would actually love to sit down and talk with him about, about fabric for a project I'm doing.
1121000	1126000	I, he would probably love to talk that, that shop, especially once he's had some of his classes down, so.
1126000	1127000	Cool.
1127000	1128000	Cool, cool.
1128000	1129000	That's pretty neat.
1129000	1130000	Anyhow, enough about that.
1130000	1135000	Let me talk about the stuff that I've been doing this week in regards to video games.
1135000	1137000	I played pretty much two video games.
1137000	1142000	I played, I went back to play Final Fantasy IV, The After Years, because as you know, I beat the main scenario,
1142000	1148000	but now there's all the spinoff scenarios, so I actually beat the Rydia scenario, which wasn't as good as the main storyline,
1148000	1152000	which is a little disappointing because she's probably my favorite character in Final Fantasy IV.
1152000	1156000	I know a lot of people really adore her, but her scenario felt extremely linear,
1156000	1162000	and I have a bad feeling that's how all the scenarios in Final Fantasy IV are going to be, all the spinoff ones,
1162000	1165000	but I, I'm not saying that's the way it is yet because I haven't played any but the one,
1165000	1169000	but I'm going to go try some of the others maybe a little later on this week.
1169000	1175000	However, I guess maybe linear is not the best word because the main scenario is kind of linear too,
1175000	1181000	but I don't know, I just felt her story wasn't as, the story felt more linear, if that makes sense.
1181000	1185000	Like it was a very point A to point B kind of story, whereas the main-
1185000	1186000	Like you were playing an outline?
1186000	1190000	Yeah, basically, but the main story felt, there were more twists and things that made it interesting.
1190000	1198000	I love, love the twist at the end of the main story because it involves introducing a new class to the game,
1198000	1202000	which I love the idea of, and I hope one shows up in Final Fantasy XIV.
1202000	1207000	I'm not going to spoil it. If you really want to know, go play it, but there's a new class.
1207000	1209000	It's a combination of two existing classes.
1209000	1211000	It has to tell me off the air because I'm poor.
1211000	1215000	It sounds awesome. It's the character I want to be in Final Fantasy XIV if they have one.
1215000	1222000	Anyway, oh, the other game, Lost Odyssey. My playing of the old school RPG made me think,
1222000	1225000	you know what, there's not a lot of new games out right now that I want to play,
1225000	1230000	so I want to go back and beat some of the old games that I didn't beat before because I was too sucked into Warcraft.
1230000	1236000	So, Lost Odyssey, old school, well not old school, but it plays like an old school Super Nintendo style RPG,
1236000	1239000	but it's on the 360 with awesome graphics.
1239000	1243000	I think the graphics are some of the best in any RPG I've seen, and the story, phenomenal.
1243000	1249000	I love the story in Lost Odyssey, and just some of the little vignettes they have in the game.
1249000	1252000	They have these little vignettes that are text stories.
1252000	1256000	Yes, you actually sit there and read these text passages, but it isn't, you know,
1256000	1263000	it has music and backgrounds, and the text like dances onto the screen in a way that kind of matches the story.
1263000	1269000	I have no way of explaining this, that doesn't make it sound totally lame, but you just have to kind of check it out.
1269000	1274000	It really impacts these stories that is a pretty cool way to just like read stuff.
1274000	1275000	I hated that part of the game.
1275000	1277000	You did? I thought the stories were so good, though.
1277000	1278000	Oh, it was horrible.
1278000	1279000	Oh, no.
1279000	1280000	I got to read this. Skip, skip, skip.
1280000	1281000	You have no feelings.
1281000	1282000	Skip, skip.
1282000	1284000	No feelings. No, that's alright.
1284000	1286000	You can skip them, though.
1286000	1289000	Once you get into a dream sequence, just hit B, and you skip the whole thing.
1289000	1292000	They get put in an archive where you can go watch them later.
1292000	1294000	So, yeah, I love Lost Odyssey.
1294000	1299000	I am about caught up to where I was before, which is where I'm right at the end of the first disc,
1299000	1301000	and I've got three more discs to go.
1301000	1307000	So you'll probably be hearing about this game over the next month or so as I play a little more each week to try and beat it,
1307000	1311000	because I want to see what happens at the end of the story, because I never played that far before.
1311000	1316000	I got sucked into raiding and, wow, or moved on to another game, because I think it came out during a busy period.
1316000	1318000	But, yeah, Lost Odyssey.
1318000	1320000	Sadly overlooked RPG on the 360.
1320000	1321000	I don't know why haters hated it.
1321000	1327000	Well, I think maybe they hated it, because in some ways it's kind of linear and a little more restrictive.
1327000	1333000	Like, it's the more Final Fantasy X style of there's no world map, but you go to select areas,
1333000	1336000	and the areas are their own little maps, if that makes sense.
1336000	1337000	I don't know.
1337000	1341000	But, yeah, I still enjoy the game.
1341000	1344000	So, yep, anyhow, that was pretty much my game of the week.
1344000	1345000	It was really just those two games.
1345000	1347000	I didn't play anything new that came out.
1347000	1349000	No new Xbox Live arcade games or anything like that.
1349000	1351000	I don't even remember what came out this week.
1351000	1352000	Was this a big week?
1352000	1353000	I heard now.
1353000	1355000	I heard that Madballs game is out next week.
1355000	1357000	You know where I heard that?
1357000	1359000	On a Facebook ad.
1359000	1361000	So we need to go try and get those guys on the show.
1361000	1366000	The Madballs, those were the designers we sat down with at E3, and they were showing us some clips of their game.
1366000	1369000	It looked neat, so I'd like to have them on to talk about the game.
1369000	1371000	So I'll have to try and get that arranged for next week or the week after.
1371000	1373000	Cool, cool.
1373000	1380000	Actdeft in chatroom asks, will Rob finish the game or will his gamer ADD kick in the middle of the game?
1380000	1382000	Stay tuned to OLR.
1382000	1387000	Darkcharger in chat says, those dream sequences in Lost Odyssey were one of the best things about the game.
1387000	1391000	It's too bad none of them were actually visualized, or maybe that was a good thing.
1391000	1392000	Good point.
1392000	1396000	I think in some ways, those stories were best left to the imagination.
1396000	1401000	It's like reading a book. Why do you read a book so you can make up your own visualizations?
1401000	1409000	But the cool thing about it was that it did things that books can't do with the text and the music and the backgrounds that you would see,
1409000	1415000	and the shifts in the backgrounds that did add some visual impact, but without showing you what people look like.
1415000	1417000	It was like deep thoughts.
1417000	1423000	In a way, it was, but you make it sound so stupid, and I'm sorry. It was awesome.
1423000	1425000	Haters gonna hate. I don't even care.
1425000	1426000	All right.
1426000	1430000	Before we get into some gaming news tonight and gaming discussion, we want to take care of some housekeeping,
1430000	1432000	of which we don't have a whole lot of right now.
1432000	1435000	No shows off in the near future or anything like that.
1435000	1438000	Still no idea what's going on for PAX, if anything.
1438000	1440000	I think both Loki and Dark Soccer are out.
1440000	1443000	I sadly may have to skip it, too.
1443000	1446000	I don't want to, though. I'm still going to try and make it work.
1446000	1450000	It's just the week right after my crazy week in Reno that I have planned.
1450000	1452000	So, yeah. Crazy, crazy.
1452000	1457000	But I'm still hoping to do PAX. I should know in the next couple weeks.
1457000	1460000	So I would love to see you guys at PAX if that happens.
1460000	1462000	Otherwise, we'll keep you posted here.
1462000	1465000	Join our Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1465000	1467000	We've been getting some ads this week and really appreciate it.
1467000	1472000	And then, of course, we have our live journal community at Orange Lounge and our Facebook group, the OL Army.
1472000	1476000	And I would plug MySpace, too, but does anyone really use that anymore?
1476000	1479000	All right. That's it. Let's move into some gaming news tonight.
1479000	1481000	Loki, start us off.
1481000	1490000	Yes. There is a big ol' rumor, or possibly leak, I guess, of a relaunch of the Tomb Raider series.
1490000	1493000	And now I know you're thinking, hey, wait a second. Didn't that already happen?
1493000	1500000	Yes, it did. But, hey, let's relaunch it again because, you know, the first relaunch didn't quite work out for them.
1500000	1504000	So, once again, they're looking to redesign Lara Croft.
1504000	1507000	And she does look quite a bit different.
1507000	1515000	They had a picture that leaked out her holding a torch with what looks like a bow across her shoulder
1515000	1521000	and what maybe appears to be a sledgehammer or something, sword or something in her hand.
1521000	1531000	But basically, they're saying that there's a small little, I guess, transcript of the premise of the game,
1531000	1536000	which they're saying that when a storm suddenly destroys her research vessel,
1536000	1543000	a young and inexperienced Lara Croft finds herself stranded on a mysterious and remote island hidden off the shores of Japan.
1543000	1554000	Despite several signs of various inhabitants on the island, it is oddly deserted, and an uneasy feeling settles as strange sounds emerge from the shadows.
1554000	1558000	With only her determination, air strength, and resourcefulness to help her,
1558000	1568000	Lara must overcome the challenge of harsh and unforgiving journeys that will take her across a vast island wilderness
1568000	1573000	and into deep, claustrophobic and menacing underground tombs.
1573000	1576000	Well, at least she's actually going to be in tombs in Tomb Raider.
1576000	1580000	So, it's more of like a scary game, and that's what Game Guru says in chat.
1580000	1583000	It's rumored to be survival horror, and I think that's stupid.
1583000	1593000	Yes, and they're also saying, I guess, that they're possibly going to do more of an open world type of game as well.
1593000	1599000	Now, what's interesting about this is this was supposedly to come from an Eidos mole,
1599000	1606000	but it's actually been kind of revealed that it wasn't exactly from inside an Eidos,
1606000	1611000	but more from a kind of a survey.
1611000	1619000	And, you know, you gotta love the survey leaks, but Joystiq, the blog that ran the story,
1619000	1625000	they actually were contacted by the Nielsen Entertainment Group to remove the image and the story.
1625000	1629000	Now, Nielsen liked the ratings people on television, right? The Nielsen ratings?
1629000	1630000	I guess.
1630000	1631000	Interesting.
1631000	1634000	I mean, they have a similar name.
1634000	1641000	So, they were asked to remove the image and the story, and it's interesting because usually, when that happens,
1641000	1644000	okay, that's kind of confirming it right there.
1644000	1650000	Just like when Namco asked us to remove some stuff, it just proved it to be true.
1650000	1657000	Yes. Of course, there's also some other hints that, you know, this may have been kind of in the works anyways,
1657000	1661000	and they pointed out four different stories they had run previously,
1661000	1667000	including Eidos's president said that the next Tomb Raider game will reinvigorate the franchise.
1667000	1672000	Crystal Dynamics is hiring folks to work on an installment of a AAA franchise.
1672000	1678000	Toby Gard, the series creator, is a leading design group for an unannounced project,
1678000	1683000	and Eidos is terrible at keeping its secret games under wraps.
1683000	1684000	Funny.
1684000	1689000	But, yeah, it's probably going to happen, and I bet you anything next year, you'll have another Tomb Raider game.
1689000	1692000	That hopefully won't suck as much as the last one.
1692000	1697000	Tomb Raider's interesting because, like, Tomb Raider, I remember, like, Tomb Raider II and the original Tomb Raider,
1697000	1700000	those were really revolutionary PC games back in the day.
1700000	1704000	But that franchise, to me anyway, I don't know, I'm sorry chatters if we have Tomb Raider fans,
1704000	1709000	but the franchise really kind of, it felt, like, so much more of the same, more of the same,
1709000	1716000	and that whole, like, 3D platformer thing was so overdone, I think, amongst the PlayStation 2 and so forth,
1716000	1721000	the whole thing felt very, to me, like, you know, after a while.
1721000	1725000	And, you know, whereas I think those original games were very revolutionary,
1725000	1729000	I think the later ones just bored the shit out of me, and I had no interest in playing them.
1729000	1735000	So it's very interesting to me, well, A, that this is a reboot of a reboot of a reboot at this point, right?
1735000	1740000	And that if they're changing the genre up a little bit, that's really interesting to me as well.
1740000	1746000	The fact that they might be going a more survival horror route, which seems to be, I guess, all the rage these days,
1746000	1750000	with your, you know, Saw and your Silent Hill and your Resident Evils.
1750000	1758000	It's even funny, though, because when I saw the picture of Lara Croft, it reminded me of, like, someone from Resident Evil.
1758000	1762000	I mean, the look of it looked very much like Jill or something. I don't know.
1762000	1766000	Well, what's interesting is that they're talking about doing a movie franchise reboot, too, right?
1766000	1771000	Could this be playing into that at all? Could the movie franchise be going more horror-based?
1771000	1776000	I mean, I wouldn't think it's going to be, like, a B-movie horror, but could the movies be going more scary?
1776000	1779000	Because, you know, there's all the talk that they're not going to have Angelina Jolie,
1779000	1784000	that they're going to have, you know, Megan Fox instead, is the rumor, I guess.
1784000	1786000	But could the movies be changing genre, too?
1786000	1787000	She's prettier.
1787000	1790000	Well, she's pretty, but she doesn't have Cambodian babies like Angelina Jolie,
1790000	1793000	so you just can't picture her being the world traveler.
1793000	1795000	I'm just kidding. I don't...
1795000	1796000	Yet.
1796000	1797000	I don't care.
1797000	1799000	No. I don't know. It's...
1799000	1801000	The thing, you know...
1801000	1805000	To me, I don't give a crap if they reboot this, because I have lost interest in this series.
1805000	1809000	Actually, I never had interest in this series, so...
1809000	1815000	Great. You know, I'd like to see them try something different, but it's not going to probably get me to play it.
1815000	1816000	But, hey.
1816000	1821000	Well, what if the game's really good, Loki? What if you hear it's as awesome as Resident Evil 4 or something, you know?
1821000	1823000	I didn't care for Resident Evil 4 either.
1823000	1827000	Of course, I didn't play Resident Evil 4, but I don't care for Resident Evil.
1827000	1829000	I just...
1829000	1830000	I don't know.
1830000	1832000	Okay, what if it plays like Grand Theft Auto 4?
1832000	1834000	It will never play like Grand Theft Auto 4.
1834000	1836000	I'm sorry.
1836000	1839000	Alright. Tigerclaw in chat says,
1839000	1841000	Megan Fox would have to do the English accent.
1841000	1844000	Angelina Jolie does have a pretty good English accent.
1844000	1848000	Joshi16 says, Megan Fox would have to actually do something interesting.
1848000	1853000	XLink says, the hell with this. Where's my pressure luck game?
1853000	1855000	You have that.
1855000	1856000	I know, there is that DVD game.
1856000	1857000	I got that for you.
1857000	1862000	I guess that shows how many people actually care about Tomb Raider, at least in our chat room, if our chat is any indication.
1862000	1867000	I'm sorry, it was all about Tomb Raider 2, locking the butler in the freezer, and then breaking Lara Croft's neck.
1867000	1870000	It was all about topless mod.
1870000	1876000	That was really the start of that whole craze of every game on the PC has a booby mod,
1876000	1880000	and it was Tomb Raider, the old school Tomb Raider, where you could run around as naked Lara.
1880000	1886000	Anyhow, I guess a lot of our folks don't really seem to care about the whole Tomb Raider reboot.
1886000	1887000	There you go.
1887000	1890000	Chat.orangelandsradio.com if you disagree.
1890000	1894000	Before I get into the next story, I want to mention this chat comment from earlier.
1894000	1896000	Robx327 in chat says,
1896000	1902000	Hey, Rob, a big game did come out this week, Battlefield 1943 on Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.
1902000	1905000	See, not really my type of game, but good point.
1905000	1907000	I know there's tons of people that are really into Battlefield.
1907000	1909000	That had a really long line at E3 as well.
1909000	1911000	I remember that.
1911000	1913000	I kept giving them away, and I never got one.
1913000	1914000	I know.
1914000	1916000	Not that I would have played it anyway.
1916000	1919000	It's just not my kind of game, and no disrespect to those who enjoy it.
1919000	1925000	I tried to play Battlefield 1942, I think, and I was just really terrible at it.
1925000	1927000	I tried playing that on the PC.
1927000	1929000	I'm just not very good at those kind of games.
1929000	1935000	But yeah, I guess that is a big game this week, but certainly for one particular genre.
1935000	1941000	So for a roleplay gamer fan like me, not as much.
1941000	1945000	Anyhow, let's move on to some other gaming news.
1945000	1951000	Speaking of roleplaying games, Dragon Quest IX is definitely highly anticipated.
1951000	1955000	Of course, it's so highly anticipated there are folks trying to get the game before it is actually out.
1955000	1962000	There's actually a leaked version of Dragon Quest IX that's showing up on some piracy sites out there.
1962000	1963000	But guess what?
1963000	1975000	If you actually download this and install it, what you're actually installing is a little hentai slideshow on your little computer, DS, called DS Owata.
1975000	1977000	And that would be actually what you are going to install.
1977000	1980000	And then I guess the thing, by the way, bricks your DS.
1980000	1988000	Yeah, it's like you're thinking, hey, so it wasn't Dragon Quest IX, but hey, this isn't bad. It's porn.
1988000	1990000	But then it bricks your DS and you're kind of screwed at that point.
1990000	1991000	You probably wouldn't like that.
1991000	1996000	There are ways to fix it though, but yeah, it's an inconvenience, I guess.
1996000	2001000	You know, I was reading about this whole story, about the whole fake ROMs, and I thought this was very interesting.
2001000	2004000	And certainly, we've heard this kind of thing before.
2004000	2008000	Haven't you heard about the musicians who put the fake music out there to stop the pirates?
2008000	2012000	I don't think it was Madonna's last album, but the one before it.
2012000	2017000	She put out these tracks on the internet that would play the first 30 seconds of the song.
2017000	2020000	And then the rest of it would be her going, what the fuck do you think you're doing?
2020000	2022000	Like, did you hear about this?
2022000	2025000	This is a couple years ago. It was really funny, actually.
2025000	2027000	But it would play the first few seconds of the song.
2027000	2029000	What the fuck do you think you're doing?
2029000	2034000	Which is essentially, this is like the game version of that, in a way.
2034000	2038000	Although, now not to say that this was something that Square Enix did themselves.
2038000	2042000	It was probably some anti-piracy people just doing that.
2042000	2046000	But you have seen this kind of thing happen before, like the original Earthbound.
2046000	2051000	I was doing some research on the internet, and did you know the Mother series in general had a lot of piracy protection on it?
2051000	2055000	That old school one on the Nintendo Entertainment System that never came over here.
2055000	2058000	Remember how there was a fully translated one that some people bought?
2058000	2064000	But it had holes in it where if you would talk to certain people, it would freeze your game up completely.
2064000	2067000	And they had to release a hack that would patch that up.
2067000	2074000	Plus, the actual Earthbound that we got here, if you try to dump the ROM of that, there actually was a lot of anti-piracy things in there.
2074000	2077000	It would check for certain things that weren't there.
2077000	2079000	Like, you tried to copy the cartridge or whatever.
2079000	2084000	You would get all the way to the last boss, it would freeze, and then you would lose all of your data.
2084000	2086000	It would erase your game. How mean is that?
2086000	2092000	Not just that, but on your way there, you would have to fight three times as many monsters the entire game.
2092000	2095000	The number of random monsters went up like crazy.
2095000	2096000	So it was very interesting to see.
2096000	2098000	But that wasn't really a fake ROM.
2098000	2105000	That was a case of where the cartridge was looking for certain things that only a legitimate cartridge would have.
2105000	2111000	I know one thing, the English version of the cart would look to see if it was being played on a PAL Super Nintendo.
2111000	2114000	Because if it was, it would lock you out and you wouldn't be able to play.
2114000	2119000	It would do those types of things to prevent the whole dumping and copying of games.
2119000	2122000	It's interesting we haven't seen more games do that.
2122000	2125000	And maybe it's harder to do with the whole CD-based system, I don't know.
2125000	2128000	But kind of interesting.
2128000	2130000	So, I don't know.
2130000	2132000	What do you think, Loki?
2132000	2135000	Do you think game companies might be doing this on purpose?
2135000	2138000	Do you think there's any chance that all Square Enix could be behind something like this?
2138000	2140000	Do you think they should be?
2140000	2141000	I think it's stupid.
2141000	2144000	Because it's not going to really stop anything.
2144000	2146000	Because really a lot of people will download it and then they'll post,
2146000	2149000	Hey, by the way, this is not the game. This is actually a hacked thing.
2149000	2151000	It's really going to affect just a small group of people.
2151000	2153000	And they found a fix for it.
2153000	2156000	So, it really accomplished nothing.
2156000	2159000	And a lot of times there will be...
2159000	2163000	We've talked about them before, different anti-piracy stuff that they have.
2163000	2166000	Especially in DS games.
2166000	2170000	It tricks people for a while and it stops them from being able to play it.
2170000	2174000	But then eventually they fix it and patch it.
2174000	2176000	And it's done.
2176000	2179000	So they found a way to un-brick all those DS's already?
2179000	2182000	I was looking up something.
2182000	2184000	Because I was actually looking at...
2184000	2186000	I didn't really want to pirate the game.
2186000	2188000	Because I don't really...
2188000	2190000	It's a full Japanese game and it's RPG.
2190000	2192000	It's just like...
2192000	2194000	I don't have time to play it for one.
2194000	2196000	And two, it's all in Japanese. I wouldn't know what the hell is going on.
2196000	2198000	So, it's just not interesting.
2198000	2201000	I was kind of curious to see if they did find a fix for that stuff.
2201000	2204000	And there was someone talking about ways to fix it.
2204000	2208000	And there was apparently a way to fix it if you'd done something else.
2208000	2210000	I don't remember what it was.
2210000	2214000	But yeah, apparently there are ways to fix it if you did brick it.
2214000	2216000	Interesting.
2216000	2218000	And Frisbee in chat says,
2218000	2220000	You can't just break someone's DS.
2220000	2222000	Well, that's what they're saying, that they break these things somehow.
2222000	2225000	I don't know how you do it, but it must do something.
2225000	2232000	It overwrote something that was on their actual firmware.
2232000	2235000	So it just kind of tweaked something.
2235000	2237000	Interesting.
2237000	2239000	Well, I don't know. Is it what these pirates deserve?
2239000	2243000	Do you think it's what people deserve for being so over-eager or careless?
2243000	2245000	Well, there's people...
2245000	2248000	Like right now, they've already got patches in the place for...
2248000	2250000	Because the actual ROM did leak out already.
2250000	2252000	Obviously, because it was going to.
2252000	2257000	But they already have hacks for it to translate the menus.
2257000	2261000	And they've got walkthroughs that people have done translating everything else.
2261000	2262000	Topless mod?
2262000	2267000	No topless mod yet, but they've hacked it so that you can max out your experience and that kind of stuff.
2267000	2269000	So, I mean, it's just only a matter of time.
2269000	2271000	Everything's just a matter of time.
2271000	2273000	There's nothing that's unhackable.
2273000	2275000	They will find a way around everything.
2275000	2278000	I don't know. I'm borderline interested in Dragon Quest IX.
2278000	2281000	If you've listened to this show before, you know I have this weird thing about handheld gaming.
2281000	2283000	It's going to come out over here eventually.
2283000	2286000	I know it's going to come out over here, but I don't know if I really want it because of the factors on the DS.
2286000	2288000	And you know how I feel about handheld gaming.
2288000	2290000	But then again, I did play Final Fantasy IV.
2290000	2293000	I've played Final Fantasy II and I on PSP.
2293000	2297000	I'll probably get this, but I'm going to wait and see the reviews first.
2297000	2301000	I'm kind of actually glad it's out in Japan for a little while before it comes out here.
2301000	2303000	That way I kind of hear if it's good or not.
2303000	2306000	I really liked Dragon Quest VIII, though, on PlayStation 2.
2306000	2308000	That was a pretty good RPG.
2308000	2310000	That's another one I need to go back and finish, along with Final Fantasy XII.
2310000	2315000	But I have to go get my PlayStation 2 and hook it up because my 3 is not backwards compatible.
2315000	2317000	Pfft. Lame.
2317000	2318000	Mine is.
2318000	2319000	Well, lucky you.
2319000	2321000	What about Dragon Quest swords on the Wii?
2321000	2323000	I'm not interested in the spin-offs, really.
2323000	2326000	Wasn't that a little cheesy, like for kids or something?
2326000	2331000	So is the person that's playing all of the Final Fantasy IV spin-offs.
2331000	2334000	Yeah, whatever.
2334000	2338000	But Final Fantasy IV is not like a kids thing. It's just old-school graphics.
2338000	2340000	You know, what was it? The Mystic Quest?
2340000	2342000	It's what I remember as a kid.
2342000	2344000	Oh, hell no, it's not Mystic Quest.
2344000	2346000	It's like Final Fantasy IV hard-type.
2346000	2353000	You know, the original Japanese one where you get random battles way more often than you did in the American release.
2353000	2354000	And so forth.
2354000	2359000	So I'm probably going to finish Final Fantasy IV, the after years.
2359000	2362000	But for right now, I wanted to go to something a little more new school.
2362000	2365000	And I remembered I really wanted to beat Lost Odyssey.
2365000	2370000	And for some weird reason, I actually do kind of want to play Blue Dragon, even though that wasn't nearly as good.
2370000	2372000	I just kind of want to finish that, so who knows.
2372000	2373000	Anyhow.
2373000	2376000	VxjasonXV in chat is frowning, saying,
2376000	2381000	I liked Mystic Quest. I beat Mystic Quest, actually. I did play that all the way through.
2381000	2383000	Yeah, it was not like it was a very hard game to beat.
2383000	2387000	Yeah, it wasn't terrible. It just wasn't Final Fantasy at all.
2387000	2389000	It really wasn't originally a Final Fantasy game, anyway.
2389000	2391000	No, it wasn't. It was sure as hell was.
2391000	2394000	In fact, do you know in Japan, that game was released as Final Fantasy USA?
2394000	2397000	Boy, didn't that make us look stupid.
2397000	2406000	But now, keep in mind, though, whenever games released in America, they get re-released in Japan as international versions.
2406000	2410000	Because typically, especially with the Square games, we start getting extra stuff.
2410000	2417000	Like, for example, Final Fantasy VII, if I'm right, it got a re-release.
2417000	2419000	10 did, I know for sure. I think 7.
2419000	2422000	Because we got another weapon.
2422000	2425000	Yeah, there was little things here and there, I think.
2425000	2428000	And they took out the test zero.
2428000	2431000	I want to say 12 had one, too. I don't remember.
2431000	2438000	But with 7, you could still find a bunch of the test bugs in the Japanese version.
2438000	2447000	Like the test zero, or one of the other events, like the Aerith sequel thing that they were supposed to have taken out.
2447000	2451000	But, hey, Shermy.
2451000	2454000	I was trying to get Shermy to talk on air, but Shermy's shy.
2454000	2458000	But, yeah, when that version came out.
2458000	2460000	Just pat her on the butt, she'll start meowing.
2460000	2463000	No, she went to her hiding place.
2463000	2466000	No, you have to pat her, like, right on the back, over her tail.
2466000	2467000	Oh, she's going to her h-
2467000	2473000	By the way, Shermy's little bed, or hiding place, is, there's this little, like, where the OLR studio computer is.
2473000	2475000	There's a little box right next to it.
2475000	2476000	I'll tell you what's in the box, too.
2476000	2477000	What's in the box?
2477000	2479000	A sheep skin rug, a sheep fur rug.
2479000	2480000	Well, at least it's not a severed head.
2480000	2485000	So, but it's, like, right in the corner, under the computer table, so it's really in a dark little corner.
2485000	2487000	And Shermy has made this, like, her little bed.
2487000	2488000	I think it's very cute.
2488000	2491000	Yeah, it's definitely covered with Shermy hair.
2491000	2492000	Yeah.
2492000	2497000	But, well, when we had, it actually, part of it got ruined because of her to start with.
2497000	2500000	But, I also spilled Kool-Aid on it.
2500000	2505000	Sorry, I didn't mean to get away from video gaming with kitty talk, but, yeah, let's move on with some more gaming news.
2505000	2509000	Dark Sakura, if you want to go ahead and get into the next thing for us.
2509000	2516000	By the way, if you want to join us in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com is the place to be live on this Sunday evening as we tape on All Games Radio.
2516000	2529000	Well, there was talk about Sony getting the Netflix service, and it's coming to the, the Bravia TV.
2529000	2531000	To the PlayStation Bravia.
2531000	2534000	To the Bravia internet capable TVs.
2534000	2540000	There's actually nothing mentioned about it coming to the PS3.
2540000	2545000	There's hints of it coming to the Wii, but nothing yet.
2545000	2562000	But, yeah, Sony is actually saying right off the bat that they were going to look into content for the PlayStation Network, but they don't have anything regarding the Netflix to announce at this time.
2562000	2566000	So, in other words, not bloody likely.
2566000	2571000	Do you think that maybe Microsoft has some type of agreement where maybe this can't come to the PlayStation 3?
2571000	2574000	Well, then again, they've always talked about it for the Wii, haven't they?
2574000	2580000	And there's surveys going out, so if Microsoft had some type of exclusive agreement, maybe that can't happen. I don't know.
2580000	2582000	But, very interesting.
2582000	2591000	I don't think, yeah, they probably just, Sony might actually not want it on their platform because they have their service on there and they don't want to compete with their service.
2591000	2593000	Because they're greedy little bastards.
2593000	2599000	It's not like Netflix, I mean let's be honest, the Netflix streaming content still leaves a lot to be desired.
2599000	2604000	You are looking at the back catalog of movies that most people miss the first time.
2604000	2609000	They do have a few decent movies on there now that they have the Stars Play especially.
2609000	2616000	They do get some stuff that's recently like to cable movies, but that's about as recent as you get with a lot of this stuff.
2616000	2619000	And now they have some of the Disney movies too, I will say, which is pretty cool.
2619000	2622000	But, there's still a lot of room for improvement.
2622000	2626000	I would say the thing I like Netflix for best is the TV shows.
2626000	2631000	They do have a lot of like the NBC shows and stuff on demand type stuff.
2631000	2637000	And you can get that, but you know, there's still a lot.
2637000	2640000	I guess Sony has the TV service too though.
2640000	2642000	Maybe that's the competition, I don't know.
2642000	2645000	But Xbox has their on demand stuff too.
2645000	2649000	Maybe they just want people to buy their stupid HDTVs.
2649000	2656000	And the best thing about this though is it's certain HDTVs and you have to have it hooked up a certain way.
2656000	2661000	And it's just like a really small percentage of people actually going to be using this.
2661000	2669000	I don't know. It's neat I guess, but you know, until it's actually supported on all their TVs.
2669000	2675000	Let me get you some chat comments from chat.orangelauntrader.com. Tigerclaw asks,
2675000	2679000	Here's the thing, are those Bravia TVs come equipped with built-in Wi-Fi?
2679000	2682000	I'm guessing they must if they have the Netflix service in them.
2682000	2685000	That's kind of the thing to do with a lot of appliances now.
2685000	2688000	Like tons of things are coming out with Wi-Fi enabled.
2688000	2692000	They have little radios now that are like internet radios basically that use Wi-Fi.
2692000	2694000	They hook right into Wi-Fi.
2694000	2701000	It's getting I guess so cheap, the technology, that you're starting to see it in a lot of stuff.
2701000	2703000	It's pretty soon my toaster's going to have Wi-Fi.
2703000	2709000	And it'll, yeah, Dark Soccer's yelling from the kitchen, you can put Linux on a toaster.
2709000	2714000	You can, but also just have the toaster connected to Wi-Fi where it goes,
2714000	2718000	Ding! The toast is done. Or maybe it'll pop a message on all your computers.
2718000	2719000	Toast is done.
2719000	2721000	Why would you leave your toast to toast?
2721000	2722000	I have a comment on this.
2722000	2724000	Alright, Dark Soccer wants to make a comment on this.
2724000	2728000	They do have a stove that has a refrigerator mode in it.
2728000	2734000	And downloads recipes so that you can cook by recipe from the internet.
2734000	2737000	So it does hook up Wi-Fi and wired.
2737000	2738000	Wow.
2738000	2739000	Yeah.
2739000	2740000	Interesting.
2740000	2744000	So yeah, the fridges have Wi-Fi in them to look up recipes and things like that.
2744000	2747000	A lot of devices have Wi-Fi in them.
2747000	2751000	So I would not be surprised at all if the TV has Wi-Fi somehow built in it.
2751000	2759000	Tigerclaw goes on to say some Blu-ray players have built in Wi-Fi but cost more as opposed to the ones built with LAN.
2759000	2765000	And that's true because, you know, to get your Blu-ray firmware updates, you have to be connected to the internet somehow, right?
2765000	2766000	Yeah.
2766000	2773000	Dark Charger in chat says, seems funny that even standalone Blu-ray players offer it from Samsung and LG.
2773000	2779000	I've heard about that too, the whole Blu-ray slash Netflix players. I've heard about that.
2779000	2783000	Deathwishing is asking for less movie news, more gaming.
2783000	2789000	Well, I guess you could tie this into gaming somehow because let's face it, those gaming consoles, the 360 and Playstation 3,
2789000	2795000	the movies are a big part of the business and kind of how they're getting into more and more homes, right?
2795000	2803000	Because maybe mom and dad and grandma aren't so interested in playing Tomb Raider on it, but they'd be more interested in downloading movies.
2803000	2805000	Watching Tomb Raider on it.
2805000	2807000	Possibly.
2807000	2809000	No, probably not.
2809000	2812000	What was the other comment we had in here?
2812000	2816000	If you want to add your comments, chat.orangecharger.com.
2816000	2820000	Dark Charger also says, seems funny that even standalone Blu-ray players...
2820000	2822000	Oh, I'm sorry, I read that one already. Where was the one?
2822000	2823000	Ah, sorry.
2823000	2828000	Dark Charger said, my guess is Sony doesn't want it because it competes with their own service in their eyes.
2828000	2834000	Well, I guess we'll see what develops.
2834000	2843000	I think it's inevitable it'll get something streaming more, you know, along the Netflix model at some point,
2843000	2848000	but maybe because Sony owns its own movie studio wants to do something different. We'll see.
2848000	2858000	Yeah. Well, Harmonix basically thinks, you know, this is according to Josh Randall, their boss,
2858000	2867000	he thinks that the music game genre could actually leave the consoles and actually go to more of their own standalone peripherals,
2867000	2873000	basically the plug-and-play type game things, and I know we've already kind of seen this with some things.
2873000	2877000	I know they're not very good, but...
2877000	2881000	That was my first reaction, too. Did you know that we have Strawberry Shortcake DDR?
2881000	2882000	Yes, I did.
2882000	2883000	It's plug-and-play?
2883000	2884000	Yeah, it's horrible.
2884000	2890000	Yeah, they're not that fun. Or wasn't there that one dance, like, I don't remember, maybe it was a DVD,
2890000	2894000	but there was some type of dance game that just came with a mat.
2894000	2895000	It was DDR.
2895000	2900000	Yeah, it was the DDR brand. It came with a mat, but it didn't do anything. The mat didn't do a damn thing.
2900000	2907000	It was just something, it was obviously made for three-year-olds, just for them to jump on the mat pretending they're actually doing something,
2907000	2913000	but it would just play these cheesy flash music videos on the TV. This is the kind of shit three and four-year-olds love, though.
2913000	2920000	So I forgive them for that, even if they did slap the DDR label on it, fine, whatever, it's not like they tried to market it to a serious audience.
2920000	2926000	But, you know, we've seen this kind of plug-and-play stuff before, even, yeah, like you said, the Strawberry Shortcake DDR,
2926000	2929000	and some of these other DDRs. Isn't there a Disney DDR that's plug-and-play, too?
2929000	2930000	Yeah.
2930000	2935000	Yeah. And, you know, I'm sure there's stuff besides just DDR. Well, there's DDR knock-offs, that's for sure.
2935000	2939000	And I, it wasn't, isn't there a guitar thing out there that's plug-and-play?
2939000	2940000	Yes.
2940000	2941000	Maybe I'm crazy.
2941000	2950000	There is. Jackspecific, they have the G2 Game Girl Hannah Montana guitar video game, which you will play.
2950000	2952000	Is Footy Monster listening, Footy?
2952000	2961000	You can play guitar, and they even have a trailer video for it on Amazon, and I actually did watch this earlier this week just to see what the hell this was,
2961000	2965000	because I knew it was crap, and I really had low expectations for it.
2965000	2979000	But you know what, hey, for the non, I don't know, experienced freak teen girl that doesn't give a crap, you know, for $30, you know, $33.27,
2979000	2987000	you can get this guitar, you know, that plug-and-plays into your TV, and you can actually play with Hannah Montana songs, I guess.
2987000	3001000	I don't know. But, I mean, until the technology becomes cheap enough to where they can really, you know, pack a lot of oomph inside of, you know, a little plastic controller,
3001000	3003000	I don't think this is really going to take off.
3003000	3011000	Well, what if, though, now, I'm sure this guy who made the comment has to be aware this type of thing has already been attempted,
3011000	3019000	but we've never seen anything on a large scale level. This kind of ties in, in a way, to the fact that, like, Wi-Fi is in all of our devices now.
3019000	3028000	I mean, I don't think you would see something like this get released for $30, but don't you think, for the cost of $150, maybe $200, which some of these games are getting up to,
3028000	3035000	they could build something that's essentially, it's not that it's console-less gaming, it's that the console is built into the controllers.
3035000	3041000	It's built into the drum kit. And I don't think you'd see anything on the level of the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3,
3041000	3044000	but I think you'd have something where, you know, it would get the job done.
3044000	3056000	You could probably get, relatively cheap, at least PlayStation 1 level hardware in one of these things really cheap, maybe even PlayStation 2 level hardware in one of these things really cheap,
3056000	3059000	where you could even go on and download songs.
3059000	3068000	I'm thinking this guy's talking about not so much the, this crap that they make for six-year-olds to, you know, to easily amuse them for a while so you don't have to listen to the wine,
3068000	3074000	but something that, you know, the more adult gamers can take seriously, and more importantly, download songs onto.
3074000	3082000	That's gonna be the big thing about these. They probably, if you bypass Xbox Live Marketplace, you bypass Sony's thing and Nintendo's thing,
3082000	3089000	what is one big thing this is really about? Cutting out the middleman. Making more money from the download songs.
3089000	3092000	I don't think it'll take off. It really, I don't think it's gonna work.
3092000	3100000	It's just because they are limited to what they can do with the hardware right now, and honestly, I think if it could be done, it would be done.
3100000	3108000	Because, I mean, obviously everyone wants to make money, and they're always trying to come up with these knock-off games.
3108000	3115000	If anything, I could see them doing something, you know, and I'm surprised Konami hasn't done this yet,
3115000	3122000	because they did this with, you know, some of their Frogger and Yu-Gi-Oh games where they have these things that you basically buy.
3122000	3126000	It's a USB thumb drive. You plug it into your computer, connects you to the internet, and you play a game.
3126000	3128000	I have one of those. It's Frogger, yeah.
3128000	3134000	Yes. So you get something like this that's either DDR or something like that. You plug the mat into your PC. Boom.
3134000	3139000	You're playing DDR. Or you plug in the guitar into your PC and you're playing Guitar Freaks or Rock Revolution.
3139000	3143000	Hopefully not Rock Revolution, but actually Guitar Freaks.
3143000	3148000	They have tons of this stuff for the TV, too. This is huge. And actually, even some hardcore gamers like this stuff,
3148000	3151000	because you have a lot of those classic video games inside the joystick.
3151000	3156000	Yeah, the flashback systems are awesome. The flashback systems are actually, you know, Atari 2600s.
3156000	3164000	Well, not just those. I'm talking about like the little joysticks that have like Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and, you know, Baby Pac-Man or whatever.
3164000	3170000	Not Baby Pac-Man. Super Pac-Man. Like, all in. Shut up. Dark Soccer is yelling in the kitchen.
3170000	3175000	I'd like to see him try to put Baby Pac-Man. But, like, you know what I'm talking about. Like, all those little things in the joystick.
3175000	3176000	That's a big market, too.
3176000	3177000	Yeah.
3177000	3184000	So, it's not surprising. What I'm saying is that all that crap is cheap. Atari 2600 is cheap.
3184000	3190000	This would really be about taking it to the next level. Because if you can get people to pay $150 for these instruments as it is,
3190000	3198000	why not get them to pay $20 more to bypass the console? And then, you know, even if the developers have to take a hit on the cost of that,
3198000	3201000	they'd make the money back on download content.
3201000	3203000	Yeah.
3203000	3210000	I don't know, guys. In chat, would you guys be interested? Let's say they could build something like this that would be at a PlayStation 2 level.
3210000	3215000	Let's say that you could basically get Rock Band on a PlayStation 2 without needing the PlayStation 2.
3215000	3217000	Or even, let's think, even beyond this.
3217000	3218000	Would you be interested in this?
3218000	3226000	Like, through, like, say, a cable provider like Comcast or something like that, you're, you know, plugging your controller into the actual, you know,
3226000	3231000	cable box and you go on their on-demand service and you're downloading songs or something like that.
3231000	3236000	Or, hell, you could even have it where you stream songs, you know, and play, you know, that way.
3236000	3242000	I mean, there's a whole lot of, you know, things they could really do with it. But I still don't think it's going to take off.
3242000	3248000	You know, and funny enough, I know I've talked about this on the show before, but back in the day, way back in the day,
3248000	3255000	my cable provider, this is, I'm talking the mid-80s, okay, my cable provider actually had an on-demand video game service.
3255000	3260000	You would buy these tokens that would cost, like, 10 bucks or whatever, and for, like, 25 cents each,
3260000	3265000	basically you would use your, like, $10 balance or whatever, for 25 cents each, you could play these little video games
3265000	3271000	that were, like, on an Atari 5200 kind of graphics level that you would play through the cable.
3271000	3275000	And I don't know if the box just happened to double as a video gaming system or what that was,
3275000	3280000	but it's fascinating to me you haven't seen cable providers do that in a long time.
3280000	3287000	The mid-80s, folks, a lot of you guys weren't even born yet. There were video games, like, on demand through the box.
3287000	3291000	Yeah, you had that too. But Sega Channel really didn't take off, you know what I mean?
3291000	3299000	But you could do this stuff. I'm kind of surprised that cable has not tried to get back into this,
3299000	3303000	especially with Comcast, especially, you know, I know them because they're the local provider here,
3303000	3309000	getting into DVR and movies on demand and telephones now.
3309000	3312000	Yeah.
3312000	3319000	And Jason says, totally not worth the investment. I remember liking the thing as a kid. I don't know.
3319000	3324000	Jason says there's no other way to do it. Not yet, anyway.
3324000	3331000	I don't know. It's just, I understand, you know, you can buy, like, these peripherals and stuff now,
3331000	3337000	and they are expensive, but, you know, at least you can use them for a few games and get some use out of them.
3337000	3345000	I don't know, and the flashback systems are good for what they are. I mean, it's some old, you know,
3345000	3349000	Atari 2600 games. You can hack them, though, so you can actually plug in your own cartridges.
3349000	3351000	Cheap thrills. That's what they are, cheap thrills.
3351000	3354000	Exactly. It's what you give your kids to play.
3354000	3361000	Alright, well, we'll see what happens with the music games in the future. I think it'll happen.
3361000	3366000	I think it'll happen, and I think it'll happen by Christmas. Maybe not this year, but they better hurry up
3366000	3373000	and do it, though, before the music, because, you know, Guitar Hero is forcing the music game series
3373000	3376000	to jump the shark, so it'll be interesting to see what happens.
3376000	3384000	Rumor is going around the internet this week that possibly we have a Kane and Lynch fiasco part 2.
3384000	3387000	Remember this? This is a whole fiasco.
3387000	3388000	I think it'll be part 3.
3388000	3389000	Is it part 3?
3389000	3392000	It did Tomb Raider. The last Tomb Raider game did the same thing.
3392000	3397000	Well, look, let's catch people up if you forgot. There was this whole fiasco at GameSpot where it was rumored,
3397000	3402000	it was never really proved one way or the other, that Eidos was buying off GameSpot to give Kane and Lynch
3402000	3407000	essentially decent reviews, and I remember it kind of resulted, wasn't that the reason why some people,
3407000	3414000	the one guy got fired was because his review for the game was bad and the company had paid a lot of money
3414000	3419000	or whatever, so they put a lot of heat on to fire the guy, but then everybody in the situation denied it.
3419000	3425000	Everybody in the scenario denied it, but it was one of those things where, gee, it all just looks too coincidental,
3425000	3426000	I think was what happened.
3426000	3432000	Well, the rumor is that Eidos could once again be messing around with review scores.
3432000	3435000	There's a nasty little story going around the blogs this week saying that
3435000	3442000	Eidos has an embargo on the review copies of Arkham Asylum, the Batman Arkham Asylum game,
3442000	3446000	and basically you cannot release your reviews until the end of the month,
3446000	3452000	but if you put the game on the cover of your magazine and have a review score with 90% or above,
3452000	3455000	then you can break the embargo early.
3455000	3459000	That's the rumor going around, and I'm sure a lot of us are looking at that going,
3459000	3460000	man, that's just shady.
3460000	3463000	And then there's others of us, including myself, that's sitting around going,
3463000	3467000	I can't wait to see what magazines have Batman Arkham Asylum on the cover next month
3467000	3469000	because those are the magazines you can no longer trust.
3469000	3473000	And these are basically, this isn't the first time this has happened.
3473000	3480000	Back in November 2008, Eidos basically was putting the same type of pressure on publishers
3480000	3486000	saying that if you're planning on reviewing Tomb Raider Underworld at less than an 8.0,
3486000	3489000	Eidos will need you to hold your review until Monday.
3489000	3494000	But if you're going to put it out now, you can put it out at a higher review.
3494000	3498000	It was like, seriously, you're going to attempt to do that?
3498000	3504000	In their defense, I understand why they're doing that because obviously they want the positive buzz going into it.
3504000	3507000	Not that I'm going to say Batman Arkham Asylum is going to be a horrible game
3507000	3509000	because it's not, it looks good.
3509000	3512000	But, you know, that's why they're doing that.
3512000	3514000	But it's still crappy.
3514000	3518000	It looks good, but after playing it at E3, my worry is it's going to be very repetitive.
3518000	3522000	But of course, I find those types of fighting games to get very repetitive very quickly.
3522000	3524000	I think it's going to be more of a rental.
3524000	3528000	But again, I'm completely judging things off a 15 minute demo I played at E3.
3528000	3531000	Do not take that as my final review of the game.
3531000	3532000	But I am a little nervous.
3532000	3535000	But I am a huge Batman fan, so, you know.
3535000	3537000	But I just want to clarify now.
3537000	3540000	Now that we've kind of said that, I do want to state this, because this is important,
3540000	3544000	is that Kotaku ran an update to their version of the story.
3544000	3549000	Eidos apparently contacted them, extremely denying the story, saying, quote,
3549000	3552000	With regards, an article posted on Ram Raider, which was the original site.
3552000	3554000	Which, by the way, Ram Raider?
3554000	3558000	I mean, I understand what they're, like, you know, Ram that you have on a computer.
3558000	3563000	But I don't want to, I don't want to make enemies, but Ram Raider? Really?
3563000	3566000	That's just begging to be made fun of. I'm sorry.
3566000	3570000	That's just a blog. It's literally like a blog run at blogspot.com.
3570000	3571000	Seems like the name of the bad porn.
3571000	3573000	I know, I know. But anyway, sorry.
3573000	3575000	I hope nobody from that site listens to the show.
3575000	3579000	I don't mean to make fun, but look at all the attention and extra views you're getting this week.
3579000	3580000	Anyway, Eidos said,
3580000	3587000	With regards to the article posted on Ram Raider alleging that Eidos has fixed review scores for Batman Arkham Asylum,
3587000	3591000	we want to state that no discussions have been held about review scores with any magazines.
3591000	3597000	In short, there is simply not one shred of truth in this article except for the title of the game.
3597000	3600000	And that is from John Brooke, the head of UK marketing for Eidos.
3600000	3602000	So they deny it, saying this is not true.
3602000	3611000	And what, you know, to be fair to them, what a good lie that would be to say that any magazine that puts it on the cover
3611000	3617000	and has a review score of 90% or above is kind of breaking the rules a little bit.
3617000	3618000	But it'll be interesting to see.
3618000	3626000	I think one way you could prove this story true is what sites have their reviews up by a certain day.
3626000	3628000	Are they all good news? You know what I mean?
3628000	3630000	Like you could see if this is true or not based on what comes out.
3630000	3634000	And also if they're coming out and saying, oh, this is the exclusive review of this.
3634000	3638000	I hate exclusive reviews of anything because that's retarded.
3638000	3642000	This is my exclusive impression of this game.
3642000	3643000	Yes, it is.
3643000	3646000	Your early review. That's what it is. Your early review.
3646000	3649000	Well, I know what's going to happen is it's going to leak out because it's Eidos.
3649000	3652000	And because it's a game that they're probably going to ship early.
3652000	3655000	So it's going to leak out to the internet and everyone will know if it's crap or not.
3655000	3657000	And it will be already out there.
3657000	3663000	And they're going to have a bunch of independent blog sites and stuff giving their reviews, breaking all the other embargos.
3663000	3666000	So it doesn't matter. You're not going to get what you want anyway.
3666000	3668000	So too bad.
3668000	3670000	This is how the things work.
3670000	3678000	Which is a darn shame because if Batman is a good game, even this rumor sadly puts a little blemish on it.
3678000	3681000	And to be honest, not one that's actually that important.
3681000	3686000	I mean, even amongst all the hardcore gamers, the people that listen to these shows and read the blogs.
3686000	3690000	I think the audience for Batman Arkham Asylum is way bigger.
3690000	3693000	You know, when you consider there's lots of Batman fans out there.
3693000	3697000	The people that saw The Dark Knight, which is, you know, just a huge, grossing movie and everything.
3697000	3700000	I think there's a big casual gaming audience for this.
3700000	3707000	And by casual gaming, I mean the college kids who thinks video games are cool but don't obsess about them like the rest of us do.
3707000	3708000	If that makes sense.
3708000	3710000	I don't think they'd give a shit one way or the other about the ratings.
3710000	3711000	Without a doubt, I think it's going to be a big game.
3711000	3712000	I think it would be too.
3712000	3719000	You know, coming out in August, there's really only Madden, this, and Wolfenstein, and maybe Section 8.
3719000	3721000	Those are the big games for August.
3721000	3727000	And, you know, I mean, I think this is probably going to be better than Wolfenstein.
3727000	3732000	So, I'd say it's like at least the second, you know, top two of the month.
3732000	3735000	Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com.
3735000	3737000	Live on this Sunday evening, July the 12th.
3737000	3741000	Dark Charger says, let's not forget that it could also go the other way around.
3741000	3742000	Hey, we'll give you a good review.
3742000	3744000	Can we please break this embargo?
3744000	3745000	Interesting perspective.
3745000	3755000	Could it be that sometimes the offering party is not the game company, but the over-eager site that wants to get the first jump on the review?
3755000	3759000	All it's about is its hits and subscriptions is really what it comes down to.
3759000	3765000	Because, you know, if they have the review early, then, you know, everybody picks up.
3765000	3769000	Oh, hey, you know, such and such site or magazine has a review early.
3769000	3770000	They put a link to it.
3770000	3774000	Everybody goes and visits it or, you know, looks at the magazine to see what the impressions are on it.
3774000	3777000	And, you know, that's it.
3777000	3783000	And then, you know, if it's the other way around, hey, you know, we'll give you a good review if you let us break the embargo.
3783000	3794000	I have a problem with that anyways because, you know, once again, there are certain websites, IGN, that like to have exclusive reviews about games and stuff like that just to get more page hits.
3794000	3798000	And that's all they really care about is just hits to their site.
3798000	3802000	And I'm sure that they make a lot of, you know, negotiations with these people.
3802000	3807000	Hell, we've seen it firsthand, negotiations about breaking embargoes and stuff.
3807000	3814000	It's just a tool to, you know, make these sites feel special and to get more hits.
3814000	3821000	Bobby in chat says, true story, I was doing a review of a certain game series and was allowed to somewhat break the embargo.
3821000	3826000	The embargo was midnight on Monday morning and my show is on Sunday night if I like the game.
3826000	3829000	But they wouldn't let me break the embargo if I didn't like it.
3829000	3839000	Dude, I'm telling you guys, I've been saying it for seven goddamn years, independent is the only people you can trust.
3839000	3841000	Believe it.
3841000	3849000	You know, I kind of hope the game leaks out early because I want to review it and break any embargo that they have.
3849000	3854000	But what if, wait a minute, you can't, you know, you can't get on here and say it's bad just because of this.
3854000	3855000	No.
3855000	3856000	You have to be fair.
3856000	3857000	Either way it goes.
3857000	3860000	You know, I'd be honest, I'm always honest about my games.
3860000	3866000	Why would I, it's not going to help anybody if I lie about, you know, whether a game's good or not.
3866000	3867000	I mean, I don't know.
3867000	3872000	I don't, honestly, I don't care enough because Eidos isn't doing anything for me.
3872000	3874000	They aren't giving me anything for free.
3874000	3876000	They aren't, you know, treating me special.
3876000	3877000	What do I care?
3877000	3879000	You know, I don't care either way.
3879000	3881000	So, big deal.
3881000	3884000	If their game sucks, their game sucks.
3884000	3887000	If it's good, good for them because they haven't had a lot of games that didn't suck.
3887000	3890000	So, yeah.
3890000	3891000	Mini Ninjas looks good though.
3891000	3893000	I'll give them that.
3893000	3894000	But, yeah.
3894000	3896000	Alright, well, we'll move on.
3896000	3901000	In the meantime, we'll continue to be as honest as possible in our reviews of games.
3901000	3903000	So, we have something called Integrity.
3903000	3904000	Yes.
3904000	3905000	So, anyway, let's move on.
3905000	3907000	We've got some more gaming news to talk about tonight.
3907000	3911000	Release date's coming up as well as a quick break before too long.
3911000	3917000	Well, we are seeing something that's a little kind of old coming out in an old way.
3917000	3919000	But it's new.
3919000	3920000	But it's old.
3920000	3921000	It's old, but it's new, but it's old.
3921000	3923000	Okay.
3923000	3928000	It's a new item done in an old way of an old franchise.
3928000	3930000	Tell us what the hell it is already.
3930000	3931000	Mega Man.
3931000	3932000	Cool.
3932000	3936000	We have Mega Man demo released for the Atari 2600.
3936000	3937000	What?
3937000	3938000	Yeah.
3938000	3941000	It was done for the I Am 8-Bit show.
3941000	3945000	And it's actually on Atari's Atari Ages forum now.
3945000	3948000	So you can go download and play it on your emulator.
3948000	3952000	And by the way, if you want to hear some of the sweet Atari 2600 music, here you go.
3952000	3954000	See if you recognize what stage this is.
3962000	3963000	That's right.
3963000	3964000	It's Elec Man.
3964000	3965000	There you go.
3965000	3967000	And this demo, by the way, is insanely short.
3967000	3969000	It's like three screens.
3969000	3974000	They play these three screens and then they go up to where the boss is and then fight the boss.
3974000	3977000	And the poor little guy dies on the boss, but...
3977000	3979000	The physics are very well done.
3979000	3980000	Yeah.
3980000	3981000	Oh, sorry.
3981000	3982000	It looks like four screens.
3982000	3984000	So if you count Elec Man's screen, it's like a fifth screen.
3984000	3989000	With the same little mini monsters, the little dudes that are on the ground crawling back and forth.
3989000	3990000	Yeah.
3990000	3992000	But still, I mean, neat concept, right?
3992000	3993000	Yeah.
3993000	3995000	But they're moving right.
3995000	3997000	And then horrible flicker when the guy gets to Elec Man.
3997000	4000000	But, hey, you know, there's only so much you can do with the hardware.
4000000	4002000	Yeah, there's some games you can make flicker work for you.
4002000	4003000	I guess that's true.
4003000	4006000	But, yeah, you know, it's interesting.
4006000	4007000	It's neat.
4007000	4015000	And I think it's more of a novel thing from, oh, that's, you know, oh, it's Atari 2600, ooh.
4015000	4016000	You know, that kind of thing.
4016000	4020000	But this does beg the question, why?
4020000	4022000	Because it can.
4022000	4024000	It's a labor of love.
4024000	4027000	I guess that's the only way you can justify it because, I mean, really?
4027000	4033000	It's something that you'll download and you'll play for five minutes and you'll go, oh, that's kind of cool.
4033000	4035000	And tell your friend, oh, ha, ha, ha, look at this.
4035000	4036000	And then you're done.
4036000	4042000	But the sad thing is it probably took the guy five days to put it all together, you know, or even longer maybe.
4042000	4044000	Maybe, maybe.
4044000	4047000	You can make a whole Metroid game in a day with the Metroid level editor.
4047000	4053000	And, you know, with the Atari games, you just have to know your basic programming and they're done.
4053000	4055000	You can probably do that in a day.
4055000	4063000	Jason in our chat room, VXJXV says, they do what they want, or I'm sorry, they do what they must because they can.
4063000	4066000	Get it? Forget it.
4066000	4067000	I, no, I get it.
4067000	4071000	And honestly, actually, I think that that's about the most accurate way to describe it.
4071000	4072000	He can do it?
4072000	4073000	Fine, do it.
4073000	4074000	Free country, your server space.
4074000	4075000	All right.
4075000	4078000	Well, we're going to do what we must because we can right now with some release dates.
4078000	4080000	Loki, take it away with the US releases.
4080000	4083000	Not much coming out this week, unfortunately.
4083000	4090000	Got a couple greatest hits games, Transformers on the PSP, now greatest hits.
4090000	4092000	I'm surprised it took this long.
4092000	4095000	And Call of Duty Road to Victory is now greatest hits as well.
4095000	4098000	Both of those can be found for 20 bucks on the PSP.
4098000	4102000	Brand new stuff, Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the Mummy on the DS.
4102000	4110000	Also coming out on PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PSP.
4110000	4113000	NCAA Football 2010 is your big game for the week.
4113000	4122000	Ripping off on the Cookie Moa franchise, Science Papa coming out on the Wii and DS this week.
4122000	4123000	Was that from the same company?
4123000	4124000	No.
4124000	4125000	Oh, funny.
4125000	4127000	From Activision.
4127000	4132000	Tony Hawk Project 8 also hitting greatest hits on PSP.
4132000	4135000	Lot of PSP greatest hits this week.
4135000	4141000	And also Marvel Ultimate Alliance also greatest hits on PSP.
4141000	4146000	And then the last game this week, Birthday Party Bash, it's basically a birthday party
4146000	4149000	in a box with coloring sheets and fun stuff like that.
4149000	4150000	Oh, yay.
4150000	4158000	A generic party game and that's available on the Wii from Take-Two.
4158000	4159000	That's it.
4159000	4160000	It's a slow week.
4160000	4166000	Oh, and a whole ton of controller skins for all your favorite college football teams available
4166000	4170000	on Xbox 360 and PS3.
4170000	4174000	Alright, well, moving on to Japanese release dates.
4174000	4178000	Nothing on Xbox 360 this week, but there is a game on PlayStation 3.
4178000	4183000	Professional Baseball Spirits version 6 is out this week from Konami in Japan and this
4183000	4187000	is like a very realistic type of baseball game because you know baseball is pretty popular
4187000	4190000	over in Japan and very realistic looking game.
4190000	4195000	It's a pretty cool looking baseball game with all the Japanese teams and such, I'm sure.
4195000	4197000	I don't know if it's an officially licensed thing or what.
4197000	4201000	I'm not that familiar with the series, but the graphics look pretty good from the screenshots
4201000	4202000	I can see.
4202000	4205000	That's really the only big release on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4205000	4212000	Going to the Nintendo Wii, the only game that's out on there is Nihon Yaku Kiku Shonen Batting
4212000	4213000	Revolution.
4213000	4214000	Yes, that's right.
4214000	4218000	Another baseball game, but this one's on the Wii and it is not the same type of game.
4218000	4220000	It's not from Konami either.
4220000	4222000	It's from a company called Alpha Unit.
4222000	4225000	That's really it on the consoles this week.
4225000	4228000	Looking at the handhelds real quick.
4228000	4232000	By the way, that baseball game is also being ported to PlayStation 2 if you haven't upgraded
4232000	4233000	for whatever reason.
4233000	4237000	But if you are on the DS, you get some Disney games this week.
4237000	4241000	Bolt is coming out as well as Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
4241000	4243000	Although, to be fair, that's EA, not Disney.
4243000	4245000	Those are out on the Nintendo DS this week.
4245000	4249000	I'm sure those are just translations of the American versions of those games.
4249000	4252000	Awatama is another game out this week on the Nintendo DS.
4252000	4256000	And quickly going to the PSP.
4256000	4260000	There really isn't a whole lot out unless you are a fan of Ys.
4260000	4261000	Yay!
4261000	4265000	Ys I and II Chronicles is the big game this week on the PSP.
4265000	4267000	So check that out.
4267000	4269000	I have that on the PC Engine.
4269000	4271000	That's really it as far as release dates go this week.
4271000	4275000	By the way, though, I do want to quickly say one thing I noticed that's being marketed here
4275000	4278000	on this site where I get the Japanese release dates from.
4278000	4280000	This new Korean thing called the Wiz.
4280000	4281000	Have you heard of this, Loki?
4281000	4286000	It's like a little handheld device that looks like, I guess you could say like a Game Boy Advance
4286000	4287000	is what it looks like.
4287000	4294000	But what it is, it's actually a little mini computer that is like, it's 533 megahertz with a 3D accelerator
4294000	4298000	open source platform Linux operating system on it.
4298000	4299000	And it's this tiny little thing.
4299000	4301000	Yeah, they've got a few of those.
4301000	4307000	Hell, they were showing off some of those at like the last, not last E3, but the last E3 went before that.
4307000	4311000	Maybe this has been out a while and I'm just now noticing it because it's on sale or something.
4311000	4312000	But it just looks neat.
4312000	4313000	It does video and everything.
4313000	4314000	They have a bunch of them, yeah.
4314000	4315000	They're out there.
4315000	4316000	A lot of open source platforms.
4316000	4319000	I think the other one was like GPX2 or something like that.
4319000	4321000	I don't know what it's called.
4321000	4324000	Looks like a direct competitor to the PSP in a way.
4324000	4328000	Yeah, and it's all open source and there are some pretty cool stuff you can get.
4328000	4330000	I think you can get like Beats of Rage and stuff like that for it.
4330000	4331000	Cool.
4331000	4334000	Well, I've only got one thing for our UK releases.
4334000	4335000	What's that?
4335000	4338000	On the 17th, Bionic Commando for PC.
4338000	4341000	That's a very slow week for releases, isn't it?
4341000	4342000	Yeah.
4342000	4343000	All across the board.
4343000	4344000	Yep.
4344000	4351000	Alright, well I guess things will probably pick up, you know, especially as we get into September, October is when we're going to start seeing the holiday games come out.
4351000	4355000	So, we deal with this lull and then we're going to be overwhelmed with stuff.
4355000	4359000	Let's get back into a couple more gaming stories and our classic game of the week.
4359000	4360000	Loki.
4360000	4361000	Yes.
4361000	4368000	So, this is kind of interesting since we were talking about game releases and everything.
4368000	4373000	There are two big games, of course, coming out this fall from Activision and EA.
4373000	4377000	It's Our Hero 5 and the Beatles Rock Band.
4377000	4385000	And, you know, those games are definitely going to be very hot sellers on all platforms.
4385000	4390000	Well, the thing is, this is also kind of a test for Activision and EA.
4390000	4398000	You see, this is the first game, or the first two games that are being released on the Wii that are going to be a $60 price point.
4398000	4403000	And now, these are not only, you know, these are not a bundle of any sort.
4403000	4404000	This is just a game by itself.
4404000	4406000	The game software is $60.
4406000	4413000	And, you may think, well that's not a big deal because, you know, the Xbox 360, we've been paying those prices since launch.
4413000	4422000	But, I have a feeling this may be a start of another new trend where, I don't know if you remember with like Xbox Live Arcade and stuff like that.
4422000	4428000	You know, top price at one point was, you know, $10 or 800 Microsoft points.
4428000	4434000	Then, there was one game out there that decided, hey, you know what, let's try, you know, charge 1200 Microsoft points.
4434000	4436000	Was it Luminous, the first one that went to $15?
4436000	4441000	It was Luminous or maybe, I'm not sure what the other one might have been.
4441000	4444000	But, Luminous was a good example of that.
4444000	4454000	And, you know, there's, you know, after that, you know, that sold pretty well so they decided, hey, you know, we can start releasing games more for, you know, $15.
4454000	4457000	And then, they're all, you know, let's release another game for $20.
4457000	4460000	And, you know, now we're getting a $20 price point game.
4460000	4469000	So, I have a feeling that the, you know, trend now with the Wii where $49.99 seemed to be the kind of the cap.
4469000	4474000	Because, I mean, after all, a lot of the Wii games that were out there were being developed at the same time on the PlayStation 2.
4474000	4477000	And, really, there is a limitation of what they can do with the hardware.
4477000	4484000	But, I guess they're thinking now that the features are close enough to each other that now it warrants a higher price point.
4484000	4492000	I don't know if everybody's noticed that, you know, it's a higher price point and how many people actually game on the Wii like with, you know, Guitar Hero and stuff.
4492000	4495000	But, that's kind of a disturbing trend.
4495000	4500000	Interesting comments in chat. Alfconanagram asks, was it the Penny Arcade game?
4500000	4503000	Now, that was the first $20 game. I know that was the first $20 game.
4503000	4504000	Yeah.
4504000	4509000	Then, Darkcharger says, I checked out Major Nelson's site and lots of users are unhappy about the $1200 price point.
4509000	4511000	Well, you know, you have to kind of look at both sides of it.
4511000	4514000	Is that, of course, people are going to be pissed they have to pay more.
4514000	4516000	But, you have to kind of wonder, is it justified?
4516000	4523000	You know what, for an in-depth game like the Penny Arcade game and Luminous and even the, well, Luminous nickel and dimed us to death a little bit.
4523000	4530000	But, I'll say more, the Penny Arcade game, Braid, you know, a lot of these games are worth $10 to $15.
4530000	4542000	You know what, you may not think so, but in my mind, the stuff that really was for $5 was the remakes of 80s video games, 80s video games where they didn't really do much to it.
4542000	4543000	Yeah.
4543000	4551000	I'm talking about the Pac-Mans, the Jiruses, the, you know, those old school, Froggers, those old school games where, you know, they didn't really do that much to it but reskin it.
4551000	4553000	That was $5.
4553000	4558000	A lot of this other stuff that they're building from the ground up, you know what, face it, a lot of it's worth $10 if not more.
4558000	4560000	But, here's my problem though.
4560000	4568000	My problem is that these games, like for the Wii and Playstation 2 versions of like Guitar Hero 5.
4568000	4576000	Now, the only difference I can see with Guitar Hero 5, and this isn't even really, I think, justifying the fact that they can charge more,
4576000	4581000	is with Guitar Hero 5, you know, I'm sure the graphics are gonna be the same in both versions.
4581000	4584000	I bet you anything they're developing them, the same company's probably developing both of them.
4584000	4589000	The only difference is you'll probably get download content with the Wii version, which is fine.
4589000	4592000	Because, you know, right now I don't think World Tour has download content on the Wii.
4592000	4595000	Maybe they do, I don't remember, but I don't think they do.
4595000	4597000	I think Rock Band 2 is the only one that does it right now.
4597000	4601000	Okay, so maybe they feel that they're more justified for that.
4601000	4607000	But, at the same time, you're kind of ripping off the consumer who's gonna go and purchase more tracks online for more money.
4607000	4609000	Making more money in the long run.
4609000	4616000	But, there's no way that these two games, like on the 360 and PS3, are gonna play exactly the same as the Wii version.
4616000	4619000	I mean, graphically, it's impossible that they're gonna look the same.
4619000	4624000	You know, I know that's not that important for a guitar hero game, but who cares?
4624000	4626000	You know, there is a difference.
4626000	4631000	And, I think that the fact that all the Wii games out there have been, you know, $49.99.
4631000	4636000	Why should this change? I mean, Guitar Hero Metallica and stuff, the last few Guitar Hero games have been the same price.
4636000	4638000	You know, why change it now?
4638000	4640000	And, same with Beatles Rock Band. What's the point?
4640000	4645000	I mean, I know Beatles, it's gonna be a more, you know, I guess, developed game.
4645000	4647000	It's a whole different style to it.
4647000	4651000	And, yeah, I'm sure that, you know, the graphics aren't gonna suffer too much, you know, on the Wii.
4651000	4653000	But, still though, I think it's a rip-off.
4653000	4658000	And, I think we're gonna start seeing more games where it's like, oh, but look at all these extra features that we added in.
4658000	4661000	But, you know what? You would have added those features anyways if you charged a $50 game.
4661000	4663000	And, maybe you should.
4663000	4667000	Because, you know, a lot of these Wii games out there aren't just, I can't justify the price point.
4667000	4669000	You know what? I gotta be honest, I don't blame them.
4669000	4674000	I mean, on one level, it's the same damn game that you get on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
4674000	4677000	So, why shouldn't they be paying the same price?
4677000	4680000	Granted, I know the Wii is a more limiting system.
4680000	4683000	But, at the same time, I mean, that's Nintendo's fault.
4683000	4685000	Not the developer.
4685000	4689000	Okay, so World Tour on the Wii does have download content, according to Act Def.
4689000	4696000	So, then really, if they've done the same stuff on World Tour already and Rock Band 2,
4696000	4701000	if they both have download content, they're not really developing a new engine, I don't think, for these games, other than the art style.
4701000	4705000	So, I don't see where the cost is coming into play.
4705000	4711000	The cost isn't, I don't think, it's not an extra cost, Loki, it's the same cost.
4711000	4714000	It's the same price point that they have on the other systems.
4714000	4721000	I mean, I know it sucks, 60 bucks for a game is very expensive, but it's not like you and I aren't gonna buy this game on the Wii anyway.
4721000	4725000	We're gonna be spending the extra 10 bucks to get it on one of the better systems.
4725000	4730000	Or, when I say better, I mean, you know, with the better graphics and things that are tailored a little more to these games.
4730000	4738000	But, in a way, I don't really fault the developer for it, they're charging the same price for the same game that they have on these other systems.
4738000	4742000	If it can't technically pull off the same thing, that's Nintendo's fault.
4742000	4751000	I think, well, you know, fine, if people don't have a problem with this now, then don't balk at it when more of your favorite games come out at a $60 price point.
4751000	4756000	Wait until Nintendo figures this out, that they can charge $60 for your next Mario game or your Metroid game and stuff like that.
4756000	4762000	And, you know what? People aren't gonna balk at it, then why shouldn't they charge those prices? Let them shoot themselves in the foot.
4762000	4769000	But, I wanna go back to the thing about the Xbox, you know, because if the games really aren't worth $60, they're not gonna sell.
4769000	4775000	There's gonna be a backlash, wait and see. I, you know, I would think twice about putting down $60 for some of the crap Nintendo picks out.
4775000	4781000	Well, I think this is almost like the same thing that, you know, like GameStop does with their Wii accessories, where they charge $5 over retail for them.
4781000	4787000	Because most consumers on the Wii don't know any better, and that's what it's gonna come down to.
4787000	4793000	Oh, well this Guitar Hero is $60 this time. Oh well, I'll just pay $60, and that's what it's gonna come down to.
4793000	4799000	But, if no one's really putting up a fuss about it, then yeah, people are gonna start having to pay more.
4799000	4808000	I don't really care, cause like I said, I don't play these games on the Wii, so they can do whatever they want, but I'm just looking out for everybody else.
4808000	4815000	I wanna go back though and say quickly about the Xbox Live thing, because, you know, there's a lot of people that think all the games should be $5,
4815000	4822000	or that, you know, all the games should be no more than $10. Well look, how can you say that the games should all be $10,
4822000	4830000	and then you turn around and plunk down $1025, $1050 even, $11 in some cities, to go see a movie that might stink,
4830000	4834000	and it's only 90 minutes long to maybe two and a half hours, you know what I mean?
4834000	4838000	Honestly, I think a $15 price point for a lot of games is justified.
4838000	4842000	Not all of them, some of them are real stinkers and don't have a thrill that lasts very long,
4842000	4847000	but I think $15, hell even $20 for some of the games, is actually kinda justified.
4847000	4851000	And you know what's good about Xbox Live and even the PlayStation Network? There's demos.
4851000	4857000	You can check them out first, you know, whereas like a movie, you can't, I mean I guess the trailer is sort of the demo for the movie,
4857000	4865000	but you know, you can't really check out Wii games. I mean, granted, you can probably get a good idea of what Guitar Hero 5 is going to be like in Beel's Rock Band,
4865000	4871000	but there are no demos on the Wii. None. Unless you go to a kiosk.
4871000	4877000	Which is too bad, because I would actually probably buy more Wii things if I could demo them first.
4877000	4886000	I've bought, I think, four games on the Wii, WiiWare. I bought that Bit.Trip Beat, and I need to get the new one.
4886000	4892000	I bought Defend Your Castle, but that was only like a day one WiiWare, I want to see what a WiiWare game looks like type of thing,
4892000	4895000	which, you know, wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great either.
4895000	4902000	I bought the Gradius Reimagining, which was pretty cool, and that actually might be it.
4902000	4906000	No, Final Fantasy IV, I bought that, which was so far the best one out of the bunch.
4906000	4912000	So, you know, but even the Final Fantasy IV, the after years, that's going to be like $35 after all the episodes,
4912000	4917000	but my whole thing is that, you know what, I paid $10 this week to see a 90 minute movie.
4917000	4922000	If I get 30 hours of gameplay out of this $35, I think in a way that's money well spent.
4922000	4924000	So, we'll see.
4924000	4931000	Joshi16 in chat says, the demo saved me $15 on Battlefield 1943. It isn't bad, just not for me.
4931000	4936000	And I think, you know, again, I think we talked about, you know, Battlefield 1943 definitely appeals to fans of a certain genre.
4936000	4945000	And to be fair, you know, with the Wii and music games are involved, they've actually been charging the same price points for bundles,
4945000	4950000	like their, you know, instrument bundles and stuff like that.
4950000	4955000	I guess that's fine, whatever, you know, people haven't balked at that yet, and I guess they're not going to balk at this,
4955000	4959000	but you know what, don't come complaining when all the games get more expensive.
4959000	4963000	You know, hell, we're going through a recession and now all the games are going to get more expensive.
4963000	4964000	Because people need their entertainment.
4964000	4974000	Exactly, so you know, I don't know, not bothering me, but you know, like I said, I'm just bringing this up to everybody so that you notice,
4974000	4979000	because you might not have, and you know, it is a big deal and you should let them know if you don't like it.
4979000	4982000	Alright, one more story for you guys before we get to the Classic Game of the Week,
4982000	4986000	and it's kind of one of those things where I really just want to let this guy rest in peace already,
4986000	4990000	but I think we have to bring it up, and it's a story about Michael Jackson.
4990000	4998000	Apparently, what's going on right now, the MJJ Production Company, this is the people that were, you know,
4998000	5004000	Michael Jackson's kind of production company that did some various tie-in things that involved the Michael Jackson brand and image.
5004000	5011000	Apparently, they have confirmed to MCVUK, which is a website for news, obviously,
5011000	5019000	that a game that stars Michael Jackson and featuring Michael Jackson music has actually been in production at MJJ Productions
5019000	5023000	for several months, and supposedly it's going to be out this holiday season.
5023000	5028000	So that's, you know, before he, you know, obviously died, they were already working on this game.
5028000	5033000	They have not said what the game is, no information about the developer, what the heck it's about.
5033000	5038000	Some people are wondering, but they did say Michael Jackson loved games, which, you know, if you consider all the...
5038000	5040000	Did you see the pictures of his arcade?
5040000	5044000	Dude, I wanted to buy the BeatMania machine. They were only asking like a thousand dollars for it.
5044000	5046000	I want his pinball tables. I want the pinball tables.
5046000	5052000	Yeah, I know, but unfortunately now that he passed away, all that stuff's going to triple in value, so there's no way I can have it now.
5052000	5056000	But if he had still been alive, I was so going to get that BeatMania machine.
5056000	5060000	How awesome would that be to own something that Michael Jackson once had?
5060000	5062000	I was saving the money to get that BeatMania machine. I'm not even kidding.
5062000	5064000	I looked at it.
5064000	5067000	Were you? Would I have been bidding against you? Probably.
5067000	5070000	Didn't he have a DDR machine? I think he had a DDR machine.
5070000	5071000	I think he did.
5071000	5072000	I would have totally bought that.
5072000	5076000	So anyway, regardless, unfortunately now none of us are going to be able to afford that.
5076000	5079000	I don't want any of his arcade games. I don't have room for arcade games.
5079000	5080000	See, I do.
5080000	5082000	I still want a DDR machine, though.
5082000	5084000	I have that garage. I could totally...
5084000	5089000	Wouldn't you love, in the OLR studio, the old one anyway, a BeatMania machine sitting in the corner?
5089000	5092000	They're not really all that hard to find. You just have to know where to look.
5092000	5096000	Yeah, but I want the one that Michael Jackson had. That's got a story behind it.
5096000	5099000	Alright, well forget it.
5099000	5102000	Anyhow, here's the thing.
5102000	5109000	One possible idea is that maybe this isn't a new game, but it could be like Moonwalker on Xbox Live Arcade.
5109000	5115000	Which, considering the flurry of Genesis revivals we've seen, is certainly a possibility.
5115000	5120000	Who knows? Maybe even Space Channel 5, because Michael Jackson did play a role in Part 2.
5120000	5121000	Ah, I somehow did that.
5121000	5122000	Even both!
5122000	5123000	I think, if anything, it would be like...
5123000	5125000	He had a major role in 2, though.
5125000	5126000	That's true.
5126000	5131000	It could be like a music game that had a tie-in with his new comeback tour that he was gonna do.
5131000	5132000	Or something.
5132000	5134000	You know, Frisbee has an interesting comment in chat.
5134000	5136000	What about SingStar Michael Jackson?
5136000	5138000	That's not a bad thought.
5138000	5139000	Especially now.
5139000	5143000	That would be cool. I would love to see a Michael Jackson rock band game.
5143000	5146000	Would be so awesome.
5146000	5150000	I think it's inevitable you're gonna see something maybe next year.
5150000	5153000	Maybe that'll be the next rock band game.
5153000	5155000	That would actually be pretty sweet, I've gotta say.
5155000	5156000	That would be awesome.
5156000	5161000	But, I don't know. Does a lot of his music cater to the rock band series of instruments?
5161000	5162000	Who cares? It doesn't matter.
5162000	5166000	I mean, they played instruments, okay? They had guitars and drums.
5166000	5167000	We had Slash.
5167000	5168000	Therefore, it will work.
5168000	5169000	I guess that's true.
5169000	5174000	I guess it could happen, but, I mean, you know, if you want to talk about, you know,
5174000	5179000	since they went all out for the Beatles with the whole reskinning and reimagining of the game's interface,
5179000	5187000	I think Michael Jackson is at that same level, you know, right up there with ABBA.
5187000	5190000	Okay, in all seriousness, Michael Jackson is definitely at that level.
5190000	5191000	If you change your mind.
5191000	5192000	What?
5192000	5193000	Nothing.
5193000	5195000	Or Journey. I'm the first in line?
5195000	5196000	Yes.
5196000	5198000	Honey, I'm still free. Yes, or Journey.
5198000	5199000	Take a chance on Michael.
5199000	5204000	But let's face it, you know, despite my personal taste, Michael Jackson is universally at that level,
5204000	5208000	where I could see them doing a whole game about him. Who knows?
5208000	5214000	Marissa Cungusto in chat confirms there are guitar parts on 70% of his songs, believe it or not.
5214000	5215000	I guess that makes sense.
5215000	5217000	You know, I just made it, what was that for?
5217000	5218000	Guitar Hero World Tour.
5218000	5219000	Was it really?
5219000	5220000	Yeah.
5220000	5221000	Interesting.
5221000	5224000	God, I hope it's not a Guitar Hero game.
5224000	5227000	Isn't that sad that I say that?
5227000	5228000	I hope it's not Guitar Hero.
5228000	5229000	I hope it's Rock Band.
5229000	5235000	But just looking at the Beatles versus Van Halen, you can just tell which one had more effort put into it.
5235000	5236000	I'm sorry.
5236000	5241000	Sorry developers of Van Halen who spent time on it, but you just didn't spend enough time?
5241000	5248000	Alright, let's get into a segment here on the show we like to call the Classic Video Game of the Week.
5248000	5254000	Now, Dark Sakura has already hinted during her gaming week that she took a trip down memory lane this week with Tiara, I think?
5254000	5259000	Yeah, I played that by myself, but we did go to the pinball thing together.
5259000	5264000	Okay, well, but there's a classic video game of the week that Dark Sakura played this week that she thinks,
5264000	5267000	you know what, maybe all the kiddies should be playing this game this week.
5267000	5270000	So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Video Game of the Week?
5270000	5274000	The Classic Game of the Week is Seiken Densetsu 3.
5274000	5281000	And it is the sequel to what we got as Secret of Mana.
5284000	5285000	Let's hear a little clip.
5285000	5294000	Right now our adventurers are in a little cave.
5294000	5301000	Yeah, sadly all of the music that I found was either the entire music or boss battle stuff, but I found this leading up to a boss battle.
5301000	5303000	The other one, I think, was a boss battle.
5303000	5306000	I'll play after that.
5306000	5310000	But this one is actually very unique.
5310000	5321000	You have a bunch of different classes, you have six characters, each of them have their own stories, and you play them in a combination.
5321000	5333000	So basically the way that you start, it's got the same type of real-time combat, you've got the same ring menu as Secret of Mana, but it's just different.
5333000	5342000	You've got, of course, your magic attributes on each character that sort of changes exactly how well they can use certain things.
5342000	5350000	You also can change your class by going light or dark, and then light light, light dark, dark light, and dark dark.
5350000	5360000	And you change up the first one at level 18 with a mana stone, or the next one is 38 with a special item.
5360000	5364000	So it's sort of different.
5364000	5372000	Also, with most of your enemies, you can actually run away from them, you can disengage your fight.
5372000	5381000	But your boss battles, you pretty much end up locked into your boss battles, so you've got all that.
5381000	5390000	You can, when you defeat all the enemies on screen, you can actually get a treasure chest, and it has a prize in it.
5390000	5394000	So that's cool.
5394000	5412000	But the difference is that instead of setting their range and aggression, you actually set how they actually fight in battle, like whether or not they want to do support, or area effect, or an individual target,
5412000	5423000	or if you're going to use your full power gauge, if you're going to use your full magic gauge, or if they're going to use magic if you control how they cast their magic.
5423000	5437000	But as far as the leveling up, you've also got the class system, you can change to a light class or a dark class, and you've got different abilities based on each of those.
5437000	5447000	You also have a different day of the week, where an elemental spirit is in charge of that day, and based on that day, that type of magic will be stronger.
5447000	5463000	Like you have Luna Day for Moon, Salamander Day for Fire, Undine Day for Water, Dryad Day for Wood, Jin Day for Wind, Gnome Day for Earth, and Mana Holy Day, where all of your magic is balanced.
5463000	5472000	So you'd have, of course, a different elemental showing on your screen to indicate what day it is.
5472000	5492000	With this one you play as different characters, they've actually been, there is a very fantastic fan translation in English that actually has all the in-game sprites translated into English, so it is a 100% translation.
5492000	5496000	I remember when that first came out, that was a big fucking deal when that thing first came out.
5496000	5516000	Oh yeah, it was a big big deal, but your characters in this are, you have Angela, who is a princess with magic power, you have Doran, who is a swordsman, you have Hawkeye, who is a thief,
5516000	5537000	Bryce, who is from the Wind Kingdom, Kevin, you have Charlotte, the Dark Prince, you've got all these different characters, but when you start off with your six, you start off with a main character and then choose two to partner with them.
5537000	5547000	So you are playing through different, you know, the story you can play through at a different time each time based on who your main person is and then who's hanging out with them.
5547000	5562000	So it's pretty neat. It really is, especially with that translation, it really is fantastic. I mean, it is seriously the best to play.
5562000	5581000	For anyone who, of course, the only way really to play this hack unless you've got some kind of cartridge conversion kit is through an emulator and I can say right now it runs very very well in the different ones that I've played it on.
5581000	5592000	And it plays on Linux! You can do good games on Linux. So I think it's well worthwhile. I love that boss right there.
5592000	5597000	Looks like a giant pumpkin head, but the actual name of the boss is Ms. Palm.
5597000	5602000	One of the bosses in the game is Jenova, with a G instead of a J.
5602000	5614000	So yeah, I totally think that it is, I think honestly for SNES RPGs, this one is about the pinnacle.
5614000	5620000	Now I apologize if I missed it somewhere in your review, but any word on why Square didn't release this over here?
5620000	5621000	I don't know.
5621000	5629000	Just pure stupidity? Lack of faith? The fact that Secret of Evermore did not live up to expectations?
5629000	5649000	Well, actually, I'm trying to do some look over. They said that Secret of Evermore was supposed to have been Seiken Densetsu 3, but they brought out something else. I don't really know the whole story on it, but they said...
5649000	5659000	Secret of Evermore was Square USA. It was like one of the only games Square USA ever did. It might be the only game Square USA ever did, and it didn't do that hot over here.
5659000	5666000	Actually, I owned it. It's not a bad game. It's just not super.
5666000	5680000	Well, part of the other reason is that they were saying that Square was deciding not to translate any more titles for a long time, and they said that it would have been too costly to produce.
5680000	5682000	Dumb, dumb, dumb.
5682000	5704000	I know, but hey, at least someone picked it up and did it. I honestly would love to see them buy the fan translation, pay for the time and effort that went into translating it, and bring it out on DS.
5704000	5706000	Pay for it with a legal order?
5706000	5718000	You know what I mean. I'd like to see them at least get compensated for all the hard work, because it had to have been a lot of work, especially since you basically had to ROM hack it to change all the sprites, too.
5718000	5722000	So it was very well done. It's a brilliant job.
5722000	5730000	Well, there you have it, your classic video game of the week, Seiken Densetsu 3, sometimes known as the lost Secret of Mana title.
5730000	5738000	That's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but there's plenty more of the show to come. We're just going to take a quick break. We'll be back in just a little bit.
5738000	5751000	We've got still more stories to talk about in part B tonight. We have rapid fire news, your emails, the FUs of the week, and some more stories, including a story on Scribblenauts, and, wait for it, nudity in part B.
5751000	5755000	That's right, we're going to get naked in part B tonight. No, just kidding, but we're going to talk about nudity.
5755000	5759000	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5759000	5781000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, July the 12th of 2009, where we are taping our 331st episode of Orange Lounge Radio live on All Games Radio, our wonderful radio site that lets us do our show live here every Sunday night.
5781000	5795000	It's available at www.allgames.com. Of course, there's lots of other great programming on All Games Radio throughout the week. They have some stuff during the day, a program that's running every day at about, I think, 3 o'clock Pacific, and then they've got some other podcasts that syndicate on the network.
5795000	5805000	And, of course, another live show before us on Sunday nights, Bobby Black Wolf, a show that Dark Soccer and myself were on many, many, many years ago under Sedation Live on Saturday night.
5805000	5815000	Lots and lots of good stuff on All Games Radio, so check it out at www.allgames.com. We're going to get back into the video game news now, though, for tonight, and we've got some rapid-fire news.
5815000	5820000	Dark Sakura, give us the rundown on some of the other news that happened this week in the gaming world.
5820000	5840000	Well, what we're seeing for $4.99 arriving on the iPhone through the App Store is Worms 2, or, I'm sorry, is actually Worms for iPod and iPod Touch. It has 14 multiplayer unlockable items and 50 different challenges to do by yourself.
5840000	5846000	You can customize your team names. So, it's Worms.
5846000	5848000	So, if you want to be Team Worm, you can.
5848000	5850000	You can be Team Wiggle Worm if you want.
5850000	5854000	I'd rather be D-Wormed.
5854000	5859000	Can I be Team Worm in my pants?
5859000	5862000	How about some Xbox stuff?
5862000	5867000	The Xbox Live Arcade Summer of Arcade Games has dates.
5867000	5880000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time re-shelled to be on the 22nd of July. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 with 56 characters coming the week after that.
5880000	5887000	On August 5th is Lotion Man, and it's a character who can explode himself at will.
5887000	5892000	Yes, he gets very angry and explodes himself. That musical cue is entirely planned.
5892000	5898000	There's 50 single player and 50 multiplayer levels. Trials HD on the 12th of August.
5898000	5903000	It's a motorbike racer, 50 tracks, 2 modes, custom, blah blah blah.
5903000	5909000	Shadow Complex on the 19th of August, which is a side-scrolling adventure game.
5909000	5910000	Metroidvania game.
5910000	5913000	Yeah, Metroidvania.
5913000	5919000	And they will all be 1200 Microsoft points, except for Splosion Man, which will be 800 points.
5919000	5926000	And, also, some stuff for Guitar Hero 5, actually.
5926000	5935000	There are 24 songs already confirmed. There will be 84 bands appearing in it.
5935000	5942000	But we've got Band of Horses, Beastie Boys, Beck, Billy Squier, Blur. I love Blur.
5942000	5948000	Bob Dylan, Children of Bodom, Coldplay, Darkest Hour, David Bowie, Deep Purple.
5948000	5951000	Elliott Smith, Iggy Pop. I love Iggy Pop.
5951000	5957000	Jeff Beck, John Mellencamp, Kings of Leon, Queens of the Stone Age, Rose Hill Drive, Santana,
5957000	5961000	The Bronx, Thrice, Tom Petty, Runnin' Down a Dream. That's a great song.
5961000	5964000	Vampire Weekend, and Wolf Mother.
5964000	5968000	And, that's it.
5968000	5974000	Alright. What's also interesting, though, is before that got announced,
5974000	5980000	there was actually a full track list that's been rumored to be put out there.
5980000	5986000	And, ironically enough, actually all those artists were on there, including a bunch of other artists.
5986000	5990000	And, I'm just going to give you some highlights here with their songs.
5990000	5995000	Rammstein with Do Host is going to be in there, which I think is pretty sweet.
5995000	5999000	But rumor, right? As opposed to Dark Soccer's thing being fact, this is rumor, right?
5999000	6006000	Although, by coincidence, or not, all of the things on the rumor list ended up being on the confirm list, right?
6006000	6007000	Yes.
6007000	6009000	Okay. I just want to make sure that's clear.
6009000	6014000	Yes. Of course, Queen and David Bowie, Under Pressure.
6014000	6019000	Let's see here. Also, a couple of Tom Petty songs.
6019000	6024000	Tom Petty, Runnin' Down a Dream, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, American Girl.
6024000	6033000	They even have the Gorillaz in the game with Feel Good Inc., which will be kind of interesting.
6033000	6040000	Blur Song 2, Bon Jovi, You Give Love a Bad Name, and many, many more.
6040000	6043000	But, very interesting.
6043000	6049000	I have to say, if that is real, which it sounds like it is, it's actually a pretty freakin' good list for Guitar Hero.
6049000	6054000	As much crap as I've given the Guitar Hero franchise, I will say this song list does make me want to buy Guitar Hero 5.
6054000	6056000	It's a pretty good song list.
6056000	6058000	Assuming that it's all correct.
6058000	6060000	Which it probably is.
6060000	6061000	Yes.
6061000	6069000	And then, a little bit of bad news. We talked about last week that there was a rumor that maybe the PSP Go was a little bit faster.
6069000	6073000	That, you know, they may have upped the processor to 480 MHz.
6073000	6082000	Yeah, unfortunately, that wouldn't be the case. Actually, that processor speed was referring to the USB speed and not the CPU.
6082000	6087000	So, no, the PSP Go is still not worth your $250. Sorry.
6087000	6098000	And then, finally, EA made booboo this week, posting on their Twitter an announcement for Command & Conquer 4.
6098000	6106000	And, kind of jumping the gun a bit. Actually, it did get later officially announced in the next coming days.
6106000	6114000	But, apparently, it was kind of funny because they had the announcement, you know, EA Los Angeles announces the development of Command & Conquer 4.
6114000	6121000	And then they had a link to a press release that wasn't there yet. So, later they added a press release and it was announced.
6121000	6122000	Dope.
6122000	6123000	But, still funny.
6123000	6125000	Aren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?
6125000	6132000	Yeah, I'm a fan of Red Alert and I actually skipped the last one. I don't know why.
6132000	6138000	But, yeah, I'm a fan of editing those to death just like I do Grand Theft Auto 4.
6138000	6143000	Alright. Well, just a handful more stories for you here for rapid fire news tonight.
6143000	6148000	Starting off with Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. Did you know some download content was originally planned for the game?
6148000	6152000	But, after all of Midway's troubles, it looks like the download content may, in fact, be shelves.
6152000	6161000	Apparently, according to Ed Boon, who was the co-creator, of course, of Mortal Kombat, some appearances from Kung Lao and Doomsday, apparently, were going to be included in the game.
6161000	6168000	On his Twitter, actually, Quan Chi, who is from Mortal Kombat 4 originally, the character design for that character showed up on his Twitter.
6168000	6171000	So, it looks like there was definitely some stuff planned.
6171000	6176000	Unfortunately, now, though, according to Ed Boon, quote, right now, I don't see it happening.
6176000	6184000	Apparently, all the code, though, for the characters was just about done, but, unfortunately, now, all the attention is focused on Mortal Kombat 9.
6184000	6186000	I guess you can thank all of Midway's recent troubles for that.
6186000	6192000	One thing that you can download right now, though, for free, even, Elder Scrolls II Daggerfall.
6192000	6198000	You may have heard of Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, because that was a huge game a couple years ago, and I'm sure Elder Scrolls V.
6198000	6203000	I'm surprised there's not been an announcement of this, but I guess, you know, Fallout 3 was where Bethesda was putting all their resources.
6203000	6207000	But I'm pretty sure next year, I bet you next E3, you're going to see Elder Scrolls V.
6207000	6214000	Well, if you want to go back to the past and explore the roots of the Elder Scrolls series, you can go back to Elder Scrolls II Daggerfall.
6214000	6223000	It is now free for download. All you have to do is go onto the website, www.elderscrolls.com, and it's now available in the download section.
6223000	6226000	So, if you want to take a piece of gaming's history, there you go.
6226000	6234000	Also, it should be pointed out that the very first Elder Scrolls game, Elder Scrolls Arena, actually had come out already before.
6234000	6237000	So, who knows? Maybe Morrowind will come out in a few more years.
6237000	6242000	One more story for you guys tonight, and that has to do with the ever-asked-about Kid Icarus game.
6242000	6247000	Apparently, somebody had asked Miyamoto about it at E3, and his response,
6247000	6248000	Wait, please!
6248000	6252000	Actually, he didn't say it really like that. I just said it that way for dramatic effect.
6252000	6256000	But he did say, Wait, please! I'm really surprised how popular that is.
6256000	6260000	But you're the first person to ask this at E3, was apparently his comment about that.
6260000	6265000	I can't believe that was the first time. I think that was the first time someone had the balls to ask him about it at E3.
6265000	6267000	But I know it's something a lot of people are asking.
6267000	6269000	It's the first time that you've asked me about that.
6269000	6272000	Apparently. You know, but that's better than no.
6272000	6276000	But I don't know. A lot of people are maybe reading a bit too much into that.
6276000	6283000	Wait, please! Which, by the way, I love that response. I'm gonna use that. I'm gonna try to use that on the show more often.
6283000	6289000	Wait, please! It does seem a little bit hopeful, but I don't know. I don't know.
6289000	6296000	We'll see, though. Perhaps that's another thing that's coming to E3 2010, but of course, that's just what all the fanboys think. Yes?
6296000	6297000	Wait, please!
6297000	6302000	That's just like, as Frisbee says in chat, Heal, please!
6302000	6306000	Cure, please! Wait, please!
6306000	6308000	How about the game, please?
6308000	6309000	How about emails, please?
6309000	6315000	Every week, you guys send us your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we take a few of them and we read them right here on the show.
6315000	6321000	Dark Soccer is gonna dive into the Mailbag head first, pull out some of our favorite emails, and read them for you tonight in our Mailbag segment.
6321000	6322000	Ooh!
6322000	6326000	Mail- Whoa, what the hell? That's not the Mailbag song. What the crap?
6326000	6329000	How about this instead? Alright, here is the Mailbag song.
6329000	6331000	There, much better.
6331000	6333000	Correct song, please.
6333000	6334000	Shut up!
6334000	6336000	Wait, please!
6336000	6339000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, Dark Soccer.
6339000	6344000	Hi, OLR crew. I was wondering what you guys thought about the concept of 3D gaming.
6344000	6353000	I already know PC gamers can do this, but a compatible monitor and shutter glasses can run you $500 or more.
6353000	6358000	Once prices even out to about $100, would any of you think this would be a popular way to play?
6358000	6362000	Would people really want to do this? Would you expect 3D to come out for console?
6362000	6367000	I hope you guys could provide some input. Oh, and rob a facepalm.
6367000	6369000	For what?
6369000	6371000	I don't know. By the way-
6371000	6373000	Explanation, please.
6373000	6378000	We've had 3D games that used glasses. Hi, we had-
6378000	6380000	The Virtual Boy.
6380000	6384000	That doesn't count. I'm talking about Master System games.
6384000	6385000	You remember?
6385000	6386000	Oh, yeah!
6386000	6391000	And a few NES games. Actually, there was a version of-
6391000	6394000	Rad Racer had 3D. Remember that?
6394000	6399000	And it was a game that actually was a predecessor to Space Harrier.
6399000	6403000	It was called Adventure 3D World or something on the Nintendo?
6403000	6405000	Oh, yeah! 3D World Runner. I remember that game.
6405000	6407000	That was a 3D World Runner.
6407000	6411000	So, yeah. That's been out and it's failed.
6411000	6417000	Yeah, but a lot of those were just little flash in the pan stupid things.
6417000	6421000	I mean, let's say there was a legitimate console based around-
6421000	6425000	Let's face it. Technology's come a long way since the days of the Amazing Red-
6425000	6429000	I'm sorry, the Amazing Red Seizure Inducing Headache Machine.
6429000	6433000	AKA the Virtual Boy. Technology's come a long way since then.
6433000	6435000	You know, what if they did-
6435000	6437000	Especially, look at what they're doing with a lot of 3D movies.
6437000	6441000	Like, if you haven't seen Up in 3D, it's actually pretty cool.
6441000	6444000	And a lot of these technologies that they're doing with 3D movies-
6444000	6447000	I could see something like this going towards video gaming in the near future.
6447000	6449000	Perhaps in the next generation of consoles.
6449000	6451000	I think that's more what our emailer's asking about.
6451000	6454000	Maybe not so much this flash in the pan crap we've seen in the past.
6454000	6457000	What if they built a whole new console with today's technology out of 3D gaming?
6457000	6459000	Would it be something you'd be interested in?
6459000	6461000	My honest answer is no.
6461000	6463000	Because 3D gaming still feels like a flash in the pan to me.
6463000	6467000	And you know what? Even after watching Up, I had a bit of a headache after a couple hours.
6467000	6470000	I think it's just a lot for your brain to process in that amount of time.
6470000	6473000	I saw Nightmare in 3D. Twice.
6473000	6479000	So, I really think that 3D just- it suits movies more, it really does.
6479000	6484000	Or like those little 3D rides like, you know, the Muppet Show in 3D.
6484000	6485000	That type of thing.
6485000	6487000	Or Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.
6487000	6489000	You know, here's my honest answer.
6489000	6495000	If I see the game that convinces me I need the 3D, then I'll be a little more sold on it.
6495000	6500000	But I think it's one of those things where I think the great 3D game idea hasn't been fully realized yet.
6500000	6503000	But who knows? Is it a possibility in the future? Of course.
6503000	6505000	You're gonna see 3D games again.
6505000	6507000	It's just a matter of time.
6507000	6510000	We're inching closer and closer to the holodeck.
6510000	6512000	I wish.
6512000	6519000	Next up is from Robert M. Thank you very much for getting the podcast caught up.
6519000	6526000	Lately I haven't been able to tune in live due to long work hours as your show here in the Midwest runs until 11pm.
6526000	6529000	And I get up around 5am to get ready for the bus.
6529000	6537000	I'm wondering why Black Wolf isn't caught up with his show, especially since he's able to get his Friday night show on the feed the next day like clockwork.
6537000	6540000	Looking forward to this week's show.
6540000	6542000	I won't answer for anybody else.
6542000	6544000	I know. We can't answer for anybody else.
6544000	6546000	But we will say it's a lot of work.
6546000	6555000	And I do know for a fact he does edit the show not in a way that's gonna edit the content of the show.
6555000	6558000	But he does it to make it sound very professional.
6558000	6562000	He takes out a lot of the dead air and things that we really should do but are too lazy to.
6562000	6564000	So that's a lot of work.
6564000	6573000	I know you guys think it's just easy to slap it together and put it on the podcast but it does take me a good 30-45 minutes to tie the two parts of the show into one.
6573000	6575000	Take out the beginning. Take out the end.
6575000	6578000	Upload it to the feed which is the biggest part and then write the description.
6578000	6580000	You know it does take a little bit of time.
6580000	6584000	And you know obviously we do it because that's part of the thing we do for signing up for the show.
6584000	6587000	But just you know it can't always happen right away.
6587000	6589000	And I know a lot of folks understand that.
6589000	6591000	I'm not saying you know don't complain.
6591000	6598000	You know and I'm sure for Bobby who edits the show even further for contextual purposes it's even more so.
6598000	6600000	So you know cut the dude some slack.
6600000	6602000	He works hard doing two shows.
6602000	6603000	One more quick note.
6603000	6614000	I gave my impressions of Faze a year or so ago and recently upgraded my old video iPod due to dead pixels to an 80 gig about I sorry 80 gig iPod classic.
6614000	6617000	It really improves playing games.
6617000	6625000	The older unit had to search for the games and would usually give a game could not be played message before finally successfully loading.
6625000	6627000	Whereas the game loads on us immediately on the classic.
6627000	6629000	Also the battery life is far improved.
6629000	6633000	Between the solitaire game that comes with it and recently the iPod version.
6633000	6637000	Not to be confused with the iPhone one of peggle.
6637000	6641000	It's admittedly been a while since I've played my DS Lite.
6641000	6648000	P.S. I probably won't get Lego Rock Band but I would get a Rock Band Lego set in a heartbeat.
6648000	6654000	It is interesting how far iPod gaming has come since like Faze.
6654000	6657000	I mean Faze is only what like a year and a half two years old.
6657000	6659000	It is very interesting to see how far the games have come.
6659000	6665000	You know we've gone from Faze to Tap Tap Revenge to you know peggle on the iPhone is pretty sweet.
6665000	6670000	I hope you guys got it during the 99 cent deal because it's at a buck.
6670000	6671000	Way got that.
6671000	6672000	It's a steal.
6672000	6673000	Way got that.
6673000	6674000	And by the way I don't know if you.
6674000	6677000	We tried to post about it on the Twitter because I don't think we had it during a show time.
6677000	6682000	But Columns and Puyo Puyo was free for a limited time over the 4th of July weekend.
6682000	6683000	And I know.
6683000	6684000	Got it.
6684000	6685000	We posted about it on Twitter.
6685000	6686000	You texted me about that.
6686000	6689000	I have to be honest I wasn't a fan of how the game controlled because.
6689000	6690000	I didn't try it yet.
6690000	6694000	Well without a directional pad you kind of have to use the touch screen to control it.
6694000	6698000	And the tilt kind of controls how fast the pieces drop.
6698000	6700000	So you can only hold your iPhone in a certain way.
6700000	6702000	So I'm a little iffy on it.
6702000	6703000	But hey.
6703000	6704000	Free.
6704000	6705000	Not gonna complain.
6705000	6706000	Yeah.
6706000	6707000	Even though I am.
6707000	6708000	And it's not yours.
6708000	6709000	Very true.
6709000	6710000	Last email from Dan Shadow.
6710000	6714000	As I'm writing this Tales of Monkey Island is on my desktop waiting to be played.
6714000	6718000	When the launcher for the game popped up a thought came to mind.
6718000	6722000	Sometime around this time last year I sent you guys my first email.
6722000	6724000	By then I'd become a regular listener of the podcast.
6724000	6727000	I just never sent anything your way.
6727000	6730000	The email was about adventure, gaming, and where it went.
6730000	6733000	Sam & Max was the only one around at that time.
6733000	6736000	Hell the Strong Bad games weren't even announced at that point.
6736000	6740000	Not to mention a forthcoming announcement on Wallace & Gromit.
6740000	6743000	I remember mentioning how cool Monkey Island and Loom were.
6743000	6747000	Now here I am a year later waiting to play a brand new Monkey Island game.
6747000	6754000	I just wanted to give a toast to video games and how they bring us such joy before popping the cork on episode 1.
6754000	6759000	I also want you guys to pat yourselves on the back to always being there.
6759000	6762000	For being the outsiders looking into the world of video games.
6762000	6765000	And for making a lengthy show that helps me in the long hours of work.
6765000	6772000	Did you know that OLR is a special tab that people can now add to their personalized Yahoo front page?
6772000	6773000	That's how I found the show.
6773000	6776000	Completely by accident. Accidentally awesome.
6776000	6779000	Really? How do you do that? I've never even heard of that.
6779000	6780000	I don't know.
6780000	6782000	I think it's just RSS feeds.
6782000	6785000	Interesting. I never really looked into that. That's cool.
6785000	6792000	P.S. The email I sent a while back about chocolate and flowers, that was a Punch Out Wii reference.
6792000	6796000	P.P.S. I heard Loom is coming out on Steam soon. Is that true?
6796000	6799000	Oh hell yeah. My ass downloaded it already.
6799000	6803000	Oh god yeah. Like a ton of the LucasArts stuff came out this week.
6803000	6809000	I'll tell you what. I came close to buying Loom on freaking TurboGrafx.
6809000	6810000	Nice.
6810000	6813000	I found a place in town that has it but they want like 35 bucks for it.
6813000	6814000	Still.
6814000	6816000	I'm close. I'm close.
6816000	6817000	What store is that?
6817000	6818000	Fairgame.
6818000	6819000	Oh okay.
6819000	6820000	I'm giving them advertising.
6820000	6822000	She told me off air just so you know.
6822000	6829000	I'm giving... I'll go ahead and say it. It's Fairgame. They're pretty good guys. A little high priced but...
6829000	6832000	They have arcade machines in their store which is kind of fun.
6832000	6834000	Really? I've never been there. In all the years I've...
6834000	6836000	I've only been there once.
6836000	6837000	I should check it out.
6837000	6838000	They sell Saturn games.
6838000	6840000	We were gonna go to...
6840000	6842000	They actually do case mods and they do disc resurfacing.
6842000	6845000	Jeff and I were gonna go to Denial's today but I was like...
6845000	6850000	The realist of me knew I wouldn't be able to get out of bed early enough to go because it's the weekend and this is where I catch up on my sleep.
6850000	6853000	But don't they sell arcade games out there once in a while too?
6853000	6854000	Yeah.
6854000	6855000	They sell Saturns.
6855000	6857000	I'm gonna go on a spree at Denial's.
6857000	6859000	Trader Dan moved out there too I think.
6859000	6860000	Nice.
6860000	6862000	They don't sell full sized arcade games out there.
6862000	6863000	Really?
6863000	6866000	No. You'd be hard pressed to find that stuff because you'd have to have like...
6866000	6869000	You'd have to go to the labels and sit down once.
6869000	6871000	There the last time I went to Denial's.
6871000	6877000	There's this one guy that's outside of the flea market proper that has arcade games.
6877000	6880000	It's like in that little outside place by where the guy sells the mini donuts.
6880000	6883000	I'll check it out. I haven't been to Denial's in like six years.
6883000	6887000	By the way, it's a giant flea market by the way for those that have no idea what I'm talking about.
6887000	6889000	A little place here locally in town.
6889000	6893000	But we actually did just buy a game from Fear Game.
6893000	6896000	We bought Captain America and the Avengers for Genesis.
6896000	6897000	Nice.
6897000	6899000	Because the SNES one is ass!
6899000	6903000	And Dan totally reminded me of something and I totally think this is the truest thing.
6903000	6906000	It's funny when you go fight the Mandarin and he's like,
6906000	6908000	Behold my power!
6908000	6910000	And then you kill him in five seconds.
6910000	6911000	Nice.
6911000	6913000	So, yeah. Anyway, this one.
6913000	6915000	Alright, that was the last email.
6915000	6917000	Loom is on Steam. Go get it.
6917000	6919000	That was the last email, huh? We need more emails.
6919000	6922000	Yeah, and you need to stop telling Twitter to email me.
6922000	6924000	Mailbag at orangeloungerator.com.
6924000	6926000	One tip I gave Twitter, by the way, today was,
6926000	6928000	You know, if you're going to tell us,
6928000	6930000	Hey, have you guys seen this news story?
6930000	6932000	And it was like a really big story.
6932000	6934000	Chances are, yes, we saw the story and we're going to cover it in the show.
6934000	6936000	We want to know your thoughts.
6936000	6940000	So, make sure in your emails you tell us your opinion on anything you send us.
6940000	6941000	I mean, it's cool.
6941000	6945000	But I don't want to say don't send us stories because sometimes we do get some cool stuff that we hadn't heard.
6945000	6949000	But if it was a big story that ran on every blog,
6949000	6951000	Yes, we probably heard of it and are talking about it during the show.
6951000	6953000	But we want to know your thoughts.
6953000	6954000	It's always about your voice.
6954000	6956000	Every gamer has a voice, remember?
6956000	6960000	So, mailbag at orangeloungerator.com is the place to send your emails.
6960000	6967000	Let's talk about some more gaming stories with a few more stories before your phone calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6967000	6969000	We've got about five stories for you guys first.
6969000	6970000	Loki.
6970000	6972000	Uh oh, it's another rumor about PSP 2.
6972000	6974000	Oh my goodness.
6974000	6977000	But yes, of course, you know with the PSP Go coming out,
6977000	6980000	I guess they've got to be working on a sequel to that.
6980000	6982000	Because, hey, why not?
6982000	6986000	Anyways, the rumor is that the PSP 2 is apparently already in development.
6986000	6993000	And that according to some inside info that Eurogamer is allegedly claiming,
6993000	6996000	that they've got their hands on information that,
6996000	7002000	Imagine technology's power VR tech will be an important part of the device.
7002000	7006000	And since without getting into too many technical specifics,
7006000	7011000	the chip code named Hydra will allow for 133 million polygons per second,
7011000	7015000	and a filtrate of 4G pixels per second.
7015000	7021000	The highest, with higher potential chip speeds, obviously allowing for more graphical power.
7021000	7027000	They said that, suggested the ballpark will match the original Xbox.
7027000	7029000	So, you know, that's not bad.
7029000	7033000	You know, PlayStation 2 quality graphics, that kind of makes sense.
7033000	7038000	And apparently the chip, I guess, will act as both the GPU and the CPU simultaneously,
7038000	7044000	increasing power and efficiency, and helping other areas of the programming for the device.
7044000	7048000	And that's just rumor right now, but we probably won't be hearing about anything,
7048000	7050000	you know, for the PSP 2 until like next year.
7050000	7052000	Obviously, probably until next year.
7052000	7054000	Because why would they announce the PSP 2's coming out?
7054000	7058000	That would be hilarious if they announced the PSP 2 coming out before the Go came out.
7058000	7064000	Just seeing the further ruin the Go's potential of actually selling.
7064000	7066000	But, uh, I don't know.
7066000	7070000	I'm still not fully sure I understand what the Hydra chip does.
7070000	7072000	You know, I'm not as big into hardware stuff.
7072000	7074000	What exactly will the Hydra chip mean for this system?
7074000	7078000	Basically, it's just a powerful chip that's going to process both, you know,
7078000	7081000	the graphics stuff and, you know, the actual game processing.
7081000	7088000	It's just a chip that's using, I guess, PowerVR, that technology.
7088000	7093000	It's just going to basically make, you know, games look like the PlayStation 2
7093000	7095000	able to be played on a portable system.
7095000	7097000	But will it blend?
7097000	7098000	Everything blends.
7098000	7100000	Oh, okay. Well, that's the important thing, I guess.
7100000	7103000	Very interesting, though, that we are getting all these details about the PSP 2
7103000	7105000	with the PSP Go still on the horizon.
7105000	7108000	I mean, this is something that's happened at SonyCamp before.
7108000	7111000	Not to pinpoint that that only happens to Sony,
7111000	7113000	because I seem to remember this whole little, like...
7113000	7114000	The Gizmondo?
7114000	7116000	Yeah, you kind of hear about these things,
7116000	7119000	or the newer N-Gage while the other N-Gage was still out, you know.
7119000	7121000	No, that was the Gizmondo.
7121000	7125000	Oh, by the way, we're going to release a widescreen version of the system
7125000	7129000	and blah, blah, blah before the actual system comes out.
7129000	7130000	Yeah, that didn't help.
7130000	7137000	Tigerclaw in chat says a graphic chip that powerful also means low battery life.
7137000	7139000	Unless they figure out something, you know.
7139000	7141000	Well, what if this is just a unit?
7141000	7145000	I mean, I'm surprised we don't see a unit that just plugs right into the wall.
7145000	7148000	And I'm not even talking about with a charger or anything like that.
7148000	7151000	You just flip out the little plug thing and just plug it right in the wall.
7151000	7152000	Wouldn't that be cool?
7152000	7154000	No, it's supposed to be a portable system.
7154000	7156000	Why the hell do I have to be tethered to a wall?
7156000	7157000	No, no, no. To charge it.
7157000	7159000	Like, the batteries built in.
7159000	7160000	Like a cell phone.
7160000	7161000	Yeah, it should be.
7161000	7163000	Yeah, it should be, but...
7163000	7165000	But then, they couldn't select the replacement batteries,
7165000	7168000	or the upgrade batteries, or all the other fun stuff.
7168000	7170000	I mean, I'm not even talking about, like, okay,
7170000	7173000	because probably folks are going, you retard DS and PSP, do that,
7173000	7174000	where you plug them into the wall.
7174000	7176000	I'm talking about without even an AC adapter.
7176000	7178000	Like, you just flick out the little, like, you know, I don't...
7178000	7181000	You flick out the little plug in the back and just plug it right in your wall.
7181000	7182000	Like your cell phone, like you said.
7182000	7184000	Yeah, I know. Well, not all cell phones have that either.
7184000	7185000	Yeah.
7185000	7186000	I don't know.
7186000	7187000	Well, here's...
7187000	7189000	Why don't they do something like...
7189000	7192000	Well, actually, they're sort of working on technology for that,
7192000	7195000	where you can charge stuff wirelessly,
7195000	7199000	where you actually have, you know, for example, they have Wii batteries
7199000	7204000	that you can get for the remotes that will actually charge through everything.
7204000	7207000	That is scary. How does that work?
7207000	7209000	I don't know. Blackmagic, apparently.
7209000	7211000	That is... wow.
7211000	7213000	But, yeah, they have them.
7213000	7215000	You know, actually, they sell them now.
7215000	7216000	You can buy them.
7216000	7220000	You basically sit the controller onto, you know, the pad.
7220000	7224000	It doesn't have any contacts. You can leave that stupid silicon thing on it and stuff.
7224000	7228000	And apparently it charges, you know, through the air.
7228000	7232000	So that's kind of scary, because I don't want electricity flying through the air,
7232000	7234000	electrocuting me, you know.
7234000	7238000	That is kind of strange how that works. Technology's weird.
7238000	7240000	But, yeah, I want to say Energizer had one.
7240000	7242000	Frisbee says it's powered by hamsters.
7242000	7245000	I'm just going to believe that, that there's miniature hamsters
7245000	7249000	and those things that power them, instead of electricity flying through the air.
7249000	7250000	Like a bad science fiction movie.
7250000	7253000	I'll see if I can find the information on it, because it's just...
7253000	7255000	It makes it sound like... remember those globes?
7255000	7259000	And I'm sure they still have them, but they were popular when I was a kid.
7259000	7261000	Like, you know, you'd see on, like, Mr. Wizard's World and shit,
7261000	7263000	like the big globes that had the lightning in them.
7263000	7264000	There's still those at Spencer's Rob.
7264000	7266000	And then when you put your fingers on the edge of them,
7266000	7268000	the lightning bolts jump to your fingers.
7268000	7271000	That's what I think of when I hear this whole charging through the air.
7271000	7276000	Like, I think, like, my house is going to turn into one of those globes.
7276000	7279000	Yeah, it's, um...
7279000	7280000	I know...
7280000	7283000	Oh, this is one of them, I think.
7283000	7286000	Was it the Incharge?
7286000	7289000	Oh, wait, that's not one. Never mind.
7289000	7292000	But yeah, I want to say it was, like, Energizer or something like that that put it out.
7292000	7295000	It was one battery company. I can't remember who put it out.
7295000	7299000	But it's crazy looking.
7299000	7301000	Oh, Energizer. Here it is.
7301000	7304000	Uses induction charging, is what it is.
7304000	7307000	And, um...
7307000	7313000	Yeah, Energizer Wiimote Wireless Induction Charger.
7313000	7316000	That's scary shit.
7316000	7319000	Black magic, I say. It's black magic.
7319000	7320000	It's a witch!
7320000	7322000	It's a witch! Burn the witch!
7322000	7325000	We found a witch. May we burn her?
7325000	7327000	All right, well, look.
7327000	7329000	Moving on to something else you might be able to get a charge out of.
7329000	7331000	How about nudity?
7331000	7333000	Let's talk about full frontal nudity.
7333000	7337000	And a story that ran on VideoGamer.com about BioWare.
7337000	7340000	Of course, BioWare was the studio behind Mass Effect,
7340000	7346000	which, you might remember, caused quite a stir behind one of its titillating lovemaking scenes in the game Mass Effect.
7346000	7350000	Well, there is an RPG coming out called Dragon Age Origins.
7350000	7355000	And apparently, BioWare is currently debating if the game should contain full frontal nudity,
7355000	7358000	because the game does have some sex scenes in it.
7358000	7360000	More cock!
7360000	7366000	So, apparently, the sex will be portrayed in cutscene-controlled environments only.
7366000	7370000	There is not going to be any type of gameplay, so sorry, no hot coffee mini-game,
7370000	7373000	where you control the thrusting or what have you.
7373000	7375000	It's part of the cinematics.
7375000	7379000	But apparently, in the game, you are going to be able to have sex with computer-controlled party members
7379000	7383000	in order to improve your relationship with them.
7383000	7385000	Like real life.
7385000	7389000	Apparently, this game was actually shown to the press behind closed doors at E3,
7389000	7391000	so that means we wouldn't have seen it.
7391000	7394000	But the sex scenes were not shown in full.
7394000	7397000	They were cut very short after they started.
7397000	7400000	By the way, of course, Mass Effect allowed the characters to have sex.
7400000	7402000	But here's the thing.
7402000	7408000	When VideoGamer.com asked the BioWare Vice President, Greg Zestchuk,
7408000	7409000	he replied, quote,
7409000	7414000	I don't think we've worked that out yet, because we can adjust that whenever we want, right?
7414000	7418000	On Mass Effect, we worked extensively to figure out how do we want to portray it.
7418000	7421000	It's not ogling pixels.
7421000	7423000	Sad, but probably titillating, too.
7423000	7428000	I think for us, it's more just making sure it fits the context of what we're trying to create.
7428000	7433000	So, in other words, what I hear is, we'll show the titties if it's for artistic purposes only,
7433000	7437000	like most actresses in Hollywood say about the nude scenes they do.
7437000	7440000	It has to be for artistic purposes.
7440000	7442000	So, here's my thing.
7442000	7446000	Look, video games are inching closer and closer to movies, right?
7446000	7450000	I'm especially thinking about Lost Odyssey, the game I've been playing this week.
7450000	7453000	The story in that game is very emotional.
7453000	7456000	And I admit, I get very verklempt at some of the things that happen in that game.
7456000	7458000	There's some very emotion-driving scenes in that.
7458000	7460000	And they do use cut scenes to portray this.
7460000	7463000	Now, granted, Lost Odyssey is not going to show titties,
7463000	7465000	because it doesn't fit the context of the game.
7465000	7469000	But what's wrong with some tits in a video game?
7469000	7474000	Especially, you know, you can't, on one hand, say titties in movies is okay,
7474000	7476000	and say that tits in games is a bad thing.
7476000	7478000	I mean, it's just...
7478000	7479000	Boobs!
7479000	7483000	It's just cock, and it's just vag.
7483000	7485000	I mean, really.
7485000	7487000	It's just a body part.
7487000	7490000	But I don't understand why our culture gets so wrapped up in this.
7490000	7493000	Especially when, oh my god, there might be tits in a video game.
7493000	7497000	So what? My god, do you know how violent games have gotten?
7497000	7500000	We've heard every word possible in a game at this point.
7500000	7503000	I mean, fuck, shit, cock, they've all been in a video game at some point.
7503000	7506000	And even if, you know, they weren't in the game,
7506000	7508000	many kids put them in anyway as the name of their characters.
7508000	7511000	Like, you know, who didn't have that Final Fantasy party
7511000	7514000	where all your character names were cock, piss, tits, and ball?
7514000	7516000	I actually didn't. I named mine after my friends.
7516000	7518000	Whatever. You know what I'm getting at, though, right?
7518000	7523000	You know, if games are getting closer and closer to movies,
7523000	7526000	if it fits the context of the game, why not?
7526000	7528000	I mean, and it's not like we've never had it before.
7528000	7531000	I mean, God of War had it, and, you know, we've seen them in other games.
7531000	7535000	Final Fantasy VII, the big deal with that was that Barret cussed.
7535000	7538000	I mean, really, what's the big deal?
7538000	7542000	It's just people who, you know, got a big butt up their butt.
7542000	7544000	A butt up their butt?
7544000	7546000	I said a bug up their butt.
7546000	7548000	I thought you said a big butt up their butt.
7548000	7550000	Isn't that a little redundant?
7550000	7552000	No, they have a big bug up their butt.
7552000	7554000	Who heard that phrase before?
7554000	7558000	Frisbee in Chat says, because boobs are worse than decapitation.
7558000	7560000	Sadly, in our culture, it seems that way, doesn't it?
7560000	7565000	It's because the people are so freaking repressed.
7565000	7567000	I mean, seriously.
7567000	7569000	And this is what I say about damn near everything.
7569000	7573000	You stop making such a big fucking deal out of it, and guess what?
7573000	7576000	It stops being a big fucking deal.
7576000	7584000	It was like, okay, for example, you can say fuck now, okay?
7584000	7586000	I was always able to say fuck.
7586000	7588000	Let me finish.
7588000	7596000	200 years ago, if you said fuck, you could be put in stocks and displayed for being profane.
7596000	7598000	What the fuck?
7598000	7600000	But you see what I mean.
7600000	7602000	Our language has evolved.
7602000	7604000	Our idea of morality has evolved.
7604000	7610000	I could go on and on about that.
7610000	7612000	It's just...
7612000	7614000	They're gonna die, Rob.
7614000	7622000	All those people with the big moral, you know, stick up their butt, so I don't say, you know, bug up their butt.
7622000	7627000	They have this big oak tree growing up their ass.
7627000	7629000	They're...
7629000	7630000	They're gonna die?
7630000	7631000	They're gonna die. Okay.
7631000	7633000	Me, some people are gonna die?
7633000	7636000	You know what I mean, though.
7636000	7638000	People are gonna move on.
7638000	7641000	Never did you bring that up again, Rob.
7641000	7649000	What is morally acceptable today is going to be tame, tame, tame, you know, 30 years from now.
7649000	7651000	It's just...
7651000	7655000	There's always gonna be a different, you know...
7655000	7657000	There's always gonna be repressed people out there.
7657000	7660000	Why do we have a comment in chat from leechum6 that says,
7660000	7663000	I think DarkSakura should shove Loki's butt up Rob's butt.
7663000	7665000	How mature are we, people?
7665000	7667000	Jesus.
7667000	7669000	How would that even work?
7669000	7673000	Why am I even trying to justify a comment like that? What the hell?
7673000	7676000	Only in our chat. chat.orangelandradio.com
7676000	7678000	Here's what I have to say.
7678000	7680000	More boobies!
7680000	7682000	More cock!
7682000	7685000	And not the animated porn star, by the way.
7685000	7687000	Michael Moorcock.
7687000	7688000	Oh, okay.
7688000	7691000	I saw it at the Lighthouse bookstore.
7691000	7694000	I was liking this more boobies tangent you were going down. Explain...
7694000	7698000	How should gamers incorporate boobies into the games?
7698000	7703000	I think that they should get those boob balls from realdoll.com
7703000	7706000	and just put them on top of their Xbox.
7706000	7712000	And then when they feel aggression at their game, they hit pause and go play with some boobies.
7712000	7716000	Look, I don't think you want to make the boob usage juvenile.
7716000	7720000	I mean, which unfortunately, that's the kind of crap that ruins it for everybody,
7720000	7723000	is that when boobies in video games becomes more acceptable,
7723000	7725000	then you're gonna see more of that stuff like, you know,
7725000	7728000	Boob Slapper 5000 on the Wii or something like that.
7728000	7729000	I'd buy that.
7729000	7732000	It's just garbage. You know, it's just absolute garbage.
7732000	7733000	But you know, I think if...
7733000	7734000	But you know what, if I...
7734000	7735000	Boobs is done tastefully.
7735000	7737000	There's gonna be garbage on the Wii regardless.
7737000	7739000	I'd rather see it all be adult garbage.
7739000	7740000	You know what?
7740000	7744000	If there were more party game collections that were all adult party games,
7744000	7746000	I think that we'd get a lot more purchases.
7746000	7749000	Well, the gaming industry is probably worried about the porn market.
7749000	7750000	I mean, think about it.
7750000	7756000	If that were to... Could that open up the floodgates to interactive porn on the Wii or the DS?
7756000	7757000	Or I mean, not the...
7757000	7761000	Not like there's not interactive porn on the PC already, Rob.
7761000	7766000	I mean, we've got Red Light District and Second Life and...
7766000	7768000	If there is a way to put porn on something...
7768000	7771000	Yeah, but Second Life doesn't count because it's furries.
7771000	7775000	If there's a way to put porn on something, porn will be on something.
7775000	7778000	People are obsessed with the Nookie.
7778000	7784000	They will... If they're not getting it in their real life, they will find some way of simulating it.
7784000	7786000	It's just...
7786000	7790000	And this is what I don't get why people are so repressed over everything.
7790000	7792000	It's just that...
7792000	7796000	Hi, humans, for the most part, are wired to fuck.
7796000	7798000	End of story.
7798000	7801000	It is whether or not...
7801000	7804000	It's, you know, you want to procreate.
7804000	7809000	Whether or not you have an interest in whatever gender one has an interest in,
7809000	7813000	or even what species one has an interest in,
7813000	7817000	human beings, for the most part, are wired to fuck.
7817000	7819000	That is a genetic imperative.
7819000	7822000	That is built into the DNA.
7822000	7827000	And while some people are not wired to fuck, and I, you know, fully...
7827000	7830000	I mean, people... Fantastic.
7830000	7832000	Asexual, right?
7832000	7834000	Some people are wired that way.
7834000	7836000	Most people are wired to fuck.
7836000	7844000	Including all of those repressed, right-wing, you know, Republican assholes
7844000	7852000	who want to, you know, or all of those, you know, religious right people, you know.
7852000	7855000	How many of them have we heard of, you know?
7855000	7862000	Oh, having affairs with Playboy bunnies in the 80s, or, you know,
7862000	7867000	senators getting blowjobs in the bathroom, or, you know,
7867000	7874000	governors running off to Argentina to go get some Argentinian nookie.
7874000	7879000	I'm looking at some of the stuff in the chatroom at chat.orangelandrejo.com.
7879000	7882000	Obviously, a text like... a chat like this is getting a big response.
7882000	7885000	Joshi16 says, Dark Sakura for President 2012.
7885000	7888000	More boobies, more cock.
7888000	7890000	Let's see, what else do we have here?
7890000	7893000	Frisbee said, Kevin Smith said that he was going to put more cock in his films
7893000	7896000	because one of his movies got an NC-17 at first.
7896000	7898000	It is a little silly.
7898000	7899000	I mean, and think about it.
7899000	7902000	If you could put this type of stuff in our culture,
7902000	7904000	you could show people how to do it the safe way.
7904000	7909000	Like, imagine, like, if people did this, but they would stop and, you know,
7909000	7914000	put on a condom first, it might help, you know, put the image of safe sex out there.
7914000	7915000	Which is smart.
7915000	7919000	It should all be handled like it was in, um, The Naked Gun,
7919000	7921000	where they had the full body condom.
7921000	7922000	Nice.
7922000	7933000	But, but no, I mean, really, it is, it's, I think that it's just the whole,
7933000	7939000	there's, I mean, okay, it's like the little kid who knows something is bad
7939000	7942000	and he does it anyway because there's that risk involved.
7942000	7945000	He's doing something naughty, you know.
7945000	7948000	It's like, you know, wanting to go sneak out and buy, you know,
7948000	7951000	and smoke packed cigarettes even though it's really disgusting.
7951000	7958000	You know, it's that same type of, you know, it's, it's something dangerous.
7958000	7961000	It's something, you know, not accepted, ooh.
7961000	7965000	Whereas you go to another country and it's like, so?
7965000	7966000	Yay, boobs.
7966000	7967000	Let's bring it back to video games.
7967000	7968000	I'm sorry.
7968000	7969000	No, that's all right.
7969000	7971000	No, but let's bring it back to video games and try to close out the topic.
7971000	7973000	Well, just my point is that there should be more boobs in video games.
7973000	7974000	Okay, fair enough.
7974000	7975000	I can agree with you on that.
7975000	7978000	I think that the more boobs and more cock we have in video games,
7978000	7980000	the less people will freak out over it.
7980000	7981000	And be sexually repressed.
7981000	7982000	Yes.
7982000	7983000	So.
7983000	7986000	People go get a vibrator.
7986000	7988000	I'll do that right now.
7988000	7990000	All right.
7990000	7992000	So anyway, what better to follow up this story with
7992000	7995000	than our FUs of the Week segment, folks?
8010000	8013000	But we have something to, of course, inspire the angst this week,
8013000	8017000	and that would be this story about a child porn collector
8017000	8021000	who blamed games for fueling his obsession.
8021000	8023000	This is a London man who said,
8023000	8025000	and I don't know why his name isn't out here,
8025000	8027000	that the London Free Press didn't run it,
8027000	8031000	apparently said he lived in a closed box of friendless fantasy
8031000	8036000	and it was fueled by video games, his computer, and comic books.
8036000	8040000	I'd work, come home, lock myself in the apartment.
8040000	8042000	After a difficult childhood in foster care,
8042000	8044000	where he was separated from his siblings,
8044000	8048000	he became a truck driver who lived by himself in squalor and clinical depression.
8048000	8053000	He was in a black hole, a strange sort of world his computer created.
8053000	8059000	Dude, I think your issues go far beyond what your computer made you do.
8059000	8062000	Your computers and video games don't control your actions.
8062000	8064000	You, sir, control your actions.
8064000	8068000	And, yeah, face palm, if I've ever heard that.
8068000	8071000	So, yes, how about some angst dedicated towards this guy this week,
8071000	8073000	the FUs of the Week, Dar Sacher.
8073000	8078000	FU to the stitch that got popped and the other stitch that regressed into my hand.
8078000	8083000	They're all coming out on Tuesday, but they hurt.
8083000	8085000	It hurts a lot.
8085000	8088000	So, fuck that.
8088000	8094000	Big ol' fuck you to Kimberly Block and also Jason K. Singleton.
8094000	8099000	You may not be familiar with them unless you live in the Sacramento area of California.
8099000	8106000	They are two of shysters, basically, that are using the American Disability Act
8106000	8109000	to file lawsuits against numerous businesses
8109000	8112000	causing them to basically settle with them to get money.
8112000	8114000	I heard about this on the news.
8114000	8118000	Those are the people that also did that in Julian, right, out of San Diego?
8118000	8120000	I don't know if they're the same people,
8120000	8122000	but I heard about this, like 80 businesses got sued or something
8122000	8124000	and the people never even visited them.
8124000	8126000	Yes, and basically this is happening again.
8126000	8128000	This woman filed four lawsuits.
8128000	8131000	Now you may be asking yourself, why the hell do I care about this?
8131000	8133000	Because it comes back to hamburgers.
8133000	8138000	And that's because they are forcing the Squeeze In,
8138000	8141000	which you may have seen them on the Food Network, a really small place.
8141000	8146000	It serves a Squeeze of Cheese, which is a third-pound burger with a third pound of cheese on it.
8146000	8148000	They're forcing them to move.
8148000	8153000	Basically, a very historic restaurant in the area
8153000	8156000	and they have to move now because this dumb bitch
8156000	8160000	doesn't realize that the Squeeze In is a historic building that can't possibly change
8160000	8165000	because it was built before they ever had these logs.
8165000	8169000	To be fair, I think they should be able to serve the handicapped.
8169000	8172000	Yes, but they can ring a bell or something.
8172000	8174000	They do, and they're willing.
8174000	8176000	And the problem is, though, she doesn't give a shit.
8176000	8180000	She probably has never been here, and the businesses that she sued are within,
8180000	8184000	like there are two liquor stores nine miles away from where she lives.
8184000	8187000	Who the fuck would drive nine miles to a liquor store?
8187000	8190000	I mean, this is Sacramento. There's a liquor store in every corner.
8190000	8194000	So it's obviously just for the money is all it's about.
8194000	8198000	And this guy in Eureka or whatever, the attorney that's doing it,
8198000	8203000	he has 164 lawsuits out there, all 88 cases.
8203000	8208000	Way to go. Thank you for closing a historic neighborhood or a historic restaurant.
8208000	8210000	I'm okay with these lawsuits.
8210000	8212000	I'm not at all.
8212000	8214000	Hold on. I'm finished.
8214000	8220000	If the business really is insensitive towards handicapped needs,
8220000	8222000	even if the person lives far away,
8222000	8225000	if the business really, truly is insensitive towards handicapped needs,
8225000	8229000	but it sounds like these places, they will make it work.
8229000	8233000	Ring the bell, honk the horn.
8233000	8236000	A lot of these places, it's not like they ignore handicapped folks.
8236000	8239000	It's because they couldn't fit their wheelchair in the building.
8239000	8242000	You can't fit in the building anyways if you're a normal human being,
8242000	8244000	let alone, you know, with a wheelchair.
8244000	8246000	They have a deck outside, you know,
8246000	8248000	in case you don't want to squeeze into the building.
8248000	8251000	Should I sue because I'm diabetic and can't have the...
8251000	8253000	Should I sue Baskin-Robbins because I'm diabetic and can't eat their ice cream?
8253000	8255000	They have no sugar added.
8255000	8257000	You know what? You know the point I'm trying to get at.
8257000	8259000	Yes. Exactly.
8259000	8261000	The whole thing is...
8261000	8267000	The Disability Act in and of itself is severely flawed.
8267000	8272000	There are people who qualify for the Disability Act
8272000	8274000	who really are perfectly innate.
8274000	8277000	You know, for like, a handicapped parking package or something.
8277000	8280000	Who, now...
8280000	8283000	Like, okay, I'm trying to remember what it is.
8283000	8287000	It's like, if you have problems balancing your checkbook,
8287000	8291000	you can actually qualify for a disabled parking.
8291000	8292000	Interesting.
8292000	8297000	I mean, it's really... The legislation on it is so flawed
8297000	8302000	that almost anyone can squeeze in and qualify for some sort of thing
8302000	8304000	under the Disabilities Act.
8304000	8305000	It needs to be modernized.
8305000	8307000	It really does need to be completely revamped.
8307000	8313000	I know people personally who definitely should have the placard.
8313000	8314000	Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
8314000	8317000	Who definitely qualify for the benefits under these.
8317000	8321000	There's people I know who should qualify and for some reason do not.
8321000	8324000	And I think it's entirely unfair.
8324000	8326000	You know, but like...
8326000	8328000	I think that there is...
8328000	8330000	You know, I put this in the same category...
8330000	8332000	Oh god, I'm going to get political again.
8332000	8334000	I'm just going to put this briefly again.
8334000	8337000	I put this in the same category as welfare.
8337000	8339000	There's a lot of room for abuse.
8339000	8343000	And if people can get a free ride, they will get a free ride.
8343000	8347000	I think that there needs to be more enabling services
8347000	8351000	instead of, you know, pandering services.
8351000	8353000	And we'll leave it at that.
8353000	8357000	I think it's so stupid.
8357000	8360000	Honestly, I think all of that should be thrown out as frivolous.
8360000	8362000	I think all of those should be thrown out as frivolous
8362000	8365000	unless she has a personal experience in those places.
8365000	8367000	That where they refuse to help her.
8367000	8368000	Yeah.
8368000	8369000	Or accommodate her.
8369000	8373000	If the business wants your money, they will accommodate you.
8373000	8374000	Right.
8374000	8376000	I don't really have a lot of big FUs in that last one
8376000	8379000	went on longer than any of us anticipated.
8379000	8380000	I don't really have a lot this week.
8380000	8383000	My only quick FU would go to my recent blood work results
8383000	8385000	because my doctor basically told me
8385000	8387000	I'm getting fat and need to exercise more.
8387000	8388000	That's great.
8388000	8391000	Just when I thought I was losing weight, I'm getting big again.
8391000	8396000	So, FU to blood work and the truths that are revealed within.
8396000	8400000	Anyhow, let's get back to some more gaming news.
8400000	8402000	We just have about three more stories for you guys.
8402000	8404000	And then it's going to be time for you guys to call in
8404000	8406000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8406000	8409000	DarkSakura, do you have a story for us about a game?
8409000	8411000	I sure do.
8411000	8415000	Plants vs. Zombies is coming out on other platforms.
8415000	8419000	Right now it's only on PC and Mac,
8419000	8423000	but PopCap is talking about working on Xbox Live Arcade version,
8423000	8427000	I do believe, and possibly on iPhone.
8427000	8429000	If there's a way they can work it in the World of Warcraft,
8429000	8431000	I'm sure they will too.
8431000	8433000	Yeah.
8433000	8435000	They're so crazy with their PopCap game.
8435000	8438000	By the way, did you hear this week about the World of Warcraft Pagle game?
8438000	8442000	Not just now the mod within World of Warcraft?
8442000	8446000	Because it's very clear there is some PopCap employees
8446000	8447000	that are addicted to World of Warcraft
8447000	8452000	because you've noticed these little mutual jerk-off sessions
8452000	8455000	going on between the two companies is really what it is.
8455000	8460000	Because you've had PopCap put in the whole official Pagle mod,
8460000	8463000	and I think they did a Bejeweled one too, inside World of Warcraft.
8463000	8468000	And now this week, Blizzard allowed these WoW images
8468000	8473000	to go out in a standalone PC version of Pagle that has WoW-themed levels.
8473000	8476000	So there definitely is some stroking going on between the two companies.
8476000	8481000	I think there's Furious dry-humping.
8481000	8483000	You know what though? They're all free, so we all win.
8483000	8485000	So I'm not going to complain.
8485000	8488000	They were all free expansions. It's brand awareness.
8488000	8493000	And it gets all the stories covered on blogs and all that, so good for them.
8493000	8494000	Dry-humping?
8494000	8497000	I think these types of partnerships I'd like to see happen more often.
8497000	8500000	I'd like to see more mutual masturbation going on in the gaming world.
8500000	8501000	I don't know about you guys.
8501000	8502000	Furious-humping?
8502000	8503000	Exactly.
8503000	8508000	Well, a game that I don't think will have Furious-humping in it,
8508000	8511000	Scribblenauts, has been rated by the ESRB.
8511000	8516000	And as creative as the game is, their description of it is just as creative.
8516000	8525000	Of course, now the ESRB is required to have little synopsis of the games.
8525000	8527000	And basically, here's what they put.
8527000	8530000	Scribblenauts, which is rated E10+.
8530000	8535000	This is a puzzle game in which players navigate a series of traps, puzzles, and enemies
8535000	8538000	to collect stars scattered throughout the colorful levels.
8538000	8543000	Players have the ability to summon different objects by writing slash typing in the words,
8543000	8547000	example, bike, spaceship, lion, and watch it come to life.
8547000	8552000	If multiple words are entered in a sequence, different whimsical scenarios can be triggered.
8552000	8555000	A bicycle can be used to jump over a baby.
8555000	8557000	A bulldozer can clear away a shark.
8557000	8559000	A cabbage can be fed to a dinosaur.
8559000	8564000	Players can elect to summon cartoony versions of bats, bombs, guns, and flamethrowers.
8564000	8568000	These types of items can be used to destroy objects or even other summoned items.
8568000	8572000	For example, a club can be used to hit an animal.
8572000	8575000	A steak can be attached to a baby to attract lions.
8575000	8578000	And rockets can be lobbed at a man.
8578000	8582000	That in itself is so amazing. You can attach a steak to a baby to attract animals.
8582000	8584000	Love it.
8584000	8585000	Sweet.
8585000	8590000	These triggered animations are minimally depicted and usually accompanied by a popping musical sound effect,
8590000	8593000	bright stars, shapes, flashes, or small puffs of smoke.
8593000	8599000	If a player wishes to, they may type the word in vomit, which causes a beige colored lump to appear on the screen.
8599000	8605000	God, if this is not the game of the year, I don't know what is.
8605000	8609000	I'm worried we've got a little much hype going on with this game caused by E3,
8609000	8615000	but we did have lulz at E3 playing this game. It was a lulz-y time.
8615000	8617000	I just hope it lasts. I hope it's not one of those games.
8617000	8621000	Because I'm worried it's one of those games that's going to be funny for 20 minutes and then you're done.
8621000	8622000	You know what I mean?
8622000	8628000	So hopefully the game behind the game is still really good. We'll see.
8628000	8630000	I hope so.
8630000	8637000	Oh, and on top of that, of course, recognizing that this is going to be a success,
8637000	8642000	they would like to see Scribblenauts come to other platforms.
8642000	8649000	We've never limited ourselves to the DS as a platform. In our heads, we'll see what the future holds.
8649000	8657000	Personally, we think that would be a hit on any platform, whether that platform would be an Xbox 360, PS3, or who knows.
8657000	8664000	And that's coming from Marius Fallbush.
8664000	8667000	I thought bad things.
8667000	8669000	Yeah, I bet you did after the booby story.
8669000	8675000	I think, though, this game is going to inspire folks to trade whimsical answers to scenarios on the internet,
8675000	8679000	like the most wacky fucking ways to beat levels that you've ever heard of.
8679000	8681000	I think that could be interesting.
8681000	8683000	It also has level swapping and custom levels.
8683000	8685000	Oh, I didn't know that. That's pretty cool.
8685000	8687000	We'll see what happens.
8687000	8690000	I wonder if there's going to be one foolproof way to beat every level, though.
8690000	8695000	There's going to be different ways to beat levels, and it's almost like golf.
8695000	8704000	You have pars in the game, where you're trying to beat the level with x number of objects spawned, that type of thing.
8704000	8708000	Well, I still remember, even in the free mode that we were messing around with,
8708000	8714000	there was a meter as to how many objects you could have at one time, so I could see them doing things with that meter.
8714000	8717000	Joshi16 in our chatroom, chat.orangelandradio.com, says,
8717000	8720000	I want it on the PC Mac, and DarkTetsuya says,
8720000	8723000	Yeah, I look forward to the game facts entries on it.
8723000	8727000	I wonder if you can summon dirty words, or if the game just scolds you for trying to put them in.
8727000	8729000	No, it just won't recognize them.
8729000	8733000	What if you put in feces? Will it not even recognize that?
8733000	8736000	I don't know. It may do poop.
8736000	8738000	You could do vomit. Why can't you do poo?
8738000	8740000	I bet any poop would be in there.
8740000	8742000	We should have Poop Rocket.
8742000	8744000	I don't think that's in the dictionary.
8744000	8747000	Or like Poop Flinging Monkey.
8747000	8749000	Alright, we'll see.
8749000	8751000	Tigerclaw brings up a good point.
8751000	8754000	Penis is not even a dirty word. It's a scientific word.
8754000	8755000	It's still not in the game.
8755000	8757000	DarkTetsuya says, So no cocks?
8757000	8760000	I think you should be able to put in cock, and a little rooster shows up.
8760000	8765000	Put in fag, and a cigarette shows up. Why not?
8765000	8767000	Just do the literal meaning.
8767000	8768000	I don't know.
8768000	8774000	We'll see more when this game comes out. I'm sure people are going to try every combination they can think of and find more easter eggs.
8774000	8783000	Because if the lolcats are in it, like long cat, you know, and uh, ceiling cat, and oh really owl.
8783000	8787000	If all those things are in it, they're probably still adding lol's to it.
8787000	8789000	Probably going through every internet meme they can find.
8789000	8791000	Giant enemy crabs are in the game.
8791000	8793000	Are they really?
8793000	8795000	Nice.
8795000	8803000	Alright anyhow, do you remember we talked a while, I'm sure at length about this on the show before about the whole Wii's new demo play feature?
8803000	8807000	This is where you'd be able to pause the game and just skip scenes like it was a DVD.
8807000	8811000	Or get walked through certain scenarios in the game.
8811000	8813000	Well guess what?
8813000	8823000	This week it was announced that through a blurb in Nikkei newspaper in Japan, the feature will be used in portable games as well.
8823000	8825000	That means it's coming to the DS.
8825000	8830000	Sorry, the newspaper referred to it as skip functionality, a skip feature if you will.
8830000	8834000	It's also supposed to be used for high speed action games.
8834000	8836000	Interesting.
8836000	8843000	So, who knows what this could bring for DS games in the future, but this does seem to be the future of Nintendo.
8843000	8845000	The future of gaming?
8845000	8848000	Well I guess that's all in how the general public responds to it.
8848000	8850000	We'll see.
8850000	8852000	That's that for demo play.
8852000	8858000	Alright, let's open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8858000	8864000	But do keep in mind if you are going to use Skype to call us, please make sure you test your connection first to ECHO123.
8864000	8868000	So again that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
8868000	8871000	Do we have some last minute stories we want to get into while we wait for some calls?
8871000	8875000	Because there's a little bit of a delay between us and when they hear us on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8875000	8877000	Oh, never mind, we're getting a call right now. I lied.
8877000	8880000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8880000	8881000	This is Lee Shem.
8881000	8883000	Hi Lee Shem, what's up?
8883000	8885000	Um, not much.
8885000	8889000	Um, I just called in to talk about BlazBlue.
8889000	8891000	Oooh, BlazBlue!
8891000	8896000	You know, I've heard Bobby talk a lot about this game, but I have not picked it up myself yet, so I don't have a lot to say.
8896000	8898000	So dude, please tell us about BlazBlue.
8898000	8906000	Well, BlazBlue is a fighting name that's supposed to be the spiritual successor to Guilty Gear.
8906000	8911000	Um, I think the total is 12 characters that you get to play as.
8911000	8917000	So we got a smaller roster list, but they're pretty balanced actually.
8917000	8924000	And the game is, well I think of it as an easier Guilty Gear actually.
8924000	8928000	Um, the button layout is just four buttons.
8928000	8938000	Um, you got light, medium, strong, and then a button you use to do cool shit.
8938000	8943000	Are you a big fighting game fan? Like, do you play a lot of the fighters that come out?
8943000	8951000	Oh yeah, I'm actually looking forward to Mall vs. Capcom 2 coming out at the end of the month, and King of Fighters 12.
8951000	8962000	Okay, so I just wanted to kind of gauge your, like, experience and love for a fighting game before I ask this next question, and that would be how does BlazBlue, in your opinion, stack up to other fighting games?
8962000	8973000	It's slower Guilty Gear, I guess, but um...
8973000	8988000	My opinion is pretty, it's faster than Street Fighter IV. Um, I just, it's a really cool, um, it's just a really cool fighting game.
8988000	8996000	Well, here's one more question I have for you, and that is, you know, with all these 2D fighting games that we're starting to see on Xbox Live Marketplace,
8996000	9005000	for instance, we've had, what, we've had King of Fighters 98, we've had Guru, Mark of the Wolves, we've had, uh, um, some of these old classic fighting games coming out,
9005000	9010000	and then, uh, I'm trying to think, what else, there's one coming up in the future, oh, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is coming up in the future.
9010000	9011000	King of Fighters 12?
9011000	9015000	And all, yeah, all these games, especially the Neo Geo ones, are coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
9015000	9025000	When you can get these games for 10, 15 dollars a pop, does that make 60 dollars or 50 dollars, whatever BlazBlue costs, worth it in comparison?
9025000	9037000	Well, when you look at the online, some of those games, like, I have Guru, Mark of the Wolves, but, from the times I played, um, online was total trash, actually.
9037000	9053000	Um, but, in BlazBlue, it's, you know, you're getting a high definition fighter, a complete story mode, um, and the story mode, um, some of the characters are, like, really interesting.
9053000	9066000	And, you know, you follow their paths, and even, like, characters, like, you know, they had me, um, saying, wow, fighting games have this good a story.
9066000	9080000	Like, sometimes I was actually laughing my ass off at some characters' wackiness, sometimes, you know, I was feeling bad for a character because, you know, I personally think that they're pathetic, and, you know,
9080000	9083000	but, you know, they just keep fighting.
9083000	9097000	Very interesting, and, you know, I've heard that's one of the stronger points about BlazBlue is that it does have more of a unique story than you usually see in fighting games, which is just, usually, the story is kind of just crafted to make the fighting make some sensical,
9097000	9102000	make some sense out of it, whereas it seems like BlazBlue, they actually put some thought into the story, so, interesting.
9102000	9105000	Uh, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9105000	9121000	Um, um, I just got a PS3, and I just wanted to say it's awesome so far, and at Best Buy, I don't know if they're doing this for all of them, but they have Valkyria Chronicles on clearance for only $15.
9121000	9124000	It's a great pickup, and, you know, very cheap.
9124000	9128000	Dude, I actually want to get that game. Where did you see that for clearance at?
9128000	9132000	Um, at their Best Buy over here in San Antonio.
9132000	9135000	Hmm, I might have to try and find that here locally. Awesome.
9135000	9144000	Well, and one other quick question for you. Why now? I'm always kind of curious. I asked, you know, when people plunk down $300, $400 for a new console, I always want to ask this.
9144000	9148000	Why now? What made you decide to take the plunge now?
9148000	9156000	Two things. One, they had this bundle going on with the Killzone 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4.
9156000	9164000	I wanted to pick that up because, you know, I think for $400, that kind of justifies it, because in the next month, we're supposed to be getting a price cut.
9164000	9169000	So, those two extra games, I don't know, they kind of seem to me to even it out.
9169000	9177000	And plus, next month, in August, there's supposed to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Blu-ray box set that I really want to pick up.
9177000	9183000	All right. Okay. Well, thank you very much for your thoughts and opinions tonight, and have fun with your PlayStation 3, all right?
9183000	9185000	All right. Thank you very much.
9185000	9189000	You're welcome. And LittleBigPlanet. It's awesome. Seriously. Later.
9189000	9195000	All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call.
9195000	9200000	I'll let... Oh, it's ringing again. You might not be able to do last-minute stories tonight.
9200000	9203000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9203000	9204000	It's GS68.
9204000	9207000	Hi, GS68. What's on your mind?
9207000	9213000	I'm going to get back from Galactica 3, which I'm guessing Dark Soccer was unable to go to this year.
9213000	9219000	Yeah. You know, Dark Soccer had the issues with her hands, so if she went, she wouldn't really be able to play the video games because of her hand.
9219000	9226000	I know. Bummer, right? And then I was going to go, but I had a conflict with the Rocky Reno show I'm doing.
9226000	9231000	I had a rehearsal this weekend, and it sucked because I was in the bay. I wasn't that far away.
9231000	9236000	It would have only taken me like 30 minutes to get there, but by the time we were done, California Extreme would have been done.
9236000	9237000	So it just didn't...
9237000	9239000	It went on until 2 a.m.
9239000	9242000	Oh, did it really? Shut up. I thought it was done at like 9 o'clock.
9242000	9250000	Ah, oh well. It doesn't matter. I wouldn't have gotten my money's worth, but I know we keep saying we're going to go every year, and then just some damn thing happens.
9250000	9253000	It's just the worst time of year. The summer is so, so busy.
9253000	9257000	But you went. How did you enjoy yourself?
9257000	9268000	It was alright. It felt like a little less games this year. I'm not sure because it's only my second year going.
9268000	9279000	Well, what kind of games did you get a chance to play? By the way, for those that have never been to California Extreme before, it's basically just a bunch of old school arcade games in a convention center.
9279000	9284000	You pay some money to get in. Have fun. That's basically what it is. It's a traveling arcade.
9284000	9299000	Most of the older games with a few 90s, 2000s games thrown in. I didn't feel high school wasn't finished, but I couldn't get on the top 10, so fuck that.
9299000	9310000	Nice. I'm looking at your photo gallery. Wait, I'm looking at your photo gallery you posted in chat, and I see that you're playing that old hologram game from Sega, the Time Traveler. That's awesome. That game was such garbage.
9310000	9319000	Yeah, I saw it. I probably got a chance to play it because when I was a kid, I'd see it until all the time, but it never really interested me.
9319000	9332000	Plus, if I remember right, when I was younger, it was really expensive to play. That's pretty cool. You have an actual punch out arcade machine. Nice. Man, it looks like you guys had a lot of fun.
9332000	9341000	I got on a plane, caught in a gang, and if you played point blank and advanced, you'd play the final piece of advanced mode. But I'll play it in the same mode.
9341000	9343000	Were there a lot of...
9343000	9346000	I'm sorry, go ahead.
9346000	9357000	Well, I guess you have to use the curtain, you know, coming down, turn it to the energy cube, then you have to shoot them to keep them away. I'd rather be picking energy cube you lose.
9357000	9359000	Hmm.
9359000	9365000	This has been an NPR game for a long time. I love that game.
9365000	9368000	I see... go ahead, sorry.
9368000	9377000	And then I thought Pachinko Machine, which is really cool, but I never got to play because by the time I thought about playing it, it was gone. They are already packing it up.
9377000	9382000	Aw, bummer. I see an actual Moonwalker machine here, too. That's pretty cool.
9382000	9389000	It's kind of surreal seeing any of that, especially considering the man died a few weeks ago.
9389000	9398000	Well, you know, the machines were made. They're out there. But yeah, I get what you're saying. It's kind of interesting to see that out in the wild right now with all the stuff in the media.
9398000	9402000	Well, what would you say is your favorite thing that you played at the show out of everything?
9402000	9407000	Once I was in Thailand, I was playing Rush 2049 because it had an 8-player setup.
9407000	9414000	Wow, nice. Getting to play it the way it's intended with all 8 people. Nice.
9414000	9415000	Yeah.
9415000	9421000	Was there any garbage that you played where you were like, man, they should have just left this at home?
9421000	9431000	There's a number of games that I played and didn't really recall enjoying for too long.
9431000	9433000	Let's see.
9433000	9440000	I came from a pretty interesting game called Chiller. It's like a game with one of those mouse and gun things.
9440000	9445000	And you have to shoot monsters to go on from one stage to the next.
9445000	9454000	But sometimes the things you shoot are corpses, like naked corpses and like in-portrait chambers and such.
9454000	9455000	What?
9455000	9456000	So it's like very weird.
9456000	9460000	That does sound very weird. But okay, whatever makes you happy, I guess.
9460000	9464000	Well, it sounds like you had a good time at the show and I swear we're really going to try and make it next year.
9464000	9466000	It just depends on the personal schedules and everything.
9466000	9467000	Hopefully.
9467000	9468000	Hopefully the surgeries or nothing like that.
9468000	9472000	But any other comments about the show or for our listeners tonight?
9472000	9479000	No, not really. I was going to get a bonus involving my pictures.
9479000	9481000	All right, well.
9481000	9483000	I'll be posting them later.
9483000	9488000	What, the picture you just posted here in chat? Hold on, I'm going to show, take a look here.
9488000	9492000	The pictures I've been posting, well, that's one of them on YouTube.
9492000	9499000	Gotcha. Well, then check out the gallery. It looks like you've got a little gallery going on Photobucket and plugging it in our chatroom.
9499000	9500000	So there you go.
9500000	9504000	All right, OTS68, glad to hear you had fun and we'll hopefully see you next year.
9504000	9506000	All right. See you.
9506000	9507000	Later, dude.
9507000	9512000	1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We've got calls coming in back to back tonight.
9512000	9514000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9514000	9516000	That's Legend of Zaku.
9516000	9518000	No, Legend of Zaku. What's on your mind?
9518000	9521000	Nothing much. Just getting through another weekend.
9521000	9526000	Just chilling back in New York City, trying to do the usual routines.
9526000	9532000	But yeah, just looking over what's been happening so far.
9532000	9540000	And then all of a sudden I see this little gem of a story right here regarding Battlefield 1943,
9540000	9550000	where apparently it says something about at least 5 million dying in the first day of multiplayer.
9550000	9557000	And then they go as far as saying that they're trying to get up to 48 million kills.
9557000	9561000	And I don't know, I hear Kotaku basically making a fit about it.
9561000	9563000	The fact that it's tasteless.
9563000	9573000	The fact that they're playing a World War II game and trying to rack up kills to match the amount in real life.
9573000	9582000	Yeah, I mean, comparing it to the real life is a little bit tacky, especially when video games are supposed to be separated from real life.
9582000	9588000	And a lot of times the justification for these games to be so violent is, well, it's not real life.
9588000	9590000	You know what I mean?
9590000	9599000	I mean, I can understand people's rationale regarding something being tasteless, but it's just a game.
9599000	9602000	I mean, what happened already happened.
9602000	9608000	Right, I mean, I'm okay with the game, but the little promotion is a little tacky.
9608000	9627000	Besides that, basically staying on the subject of tastelessness, another one where they have a flash game I believe that recreates Flight 1549, the one that landed on the Hudson earlier this year.
9627000	9638000	And so they're basically saying, I don't know, it's just on the same subject of being tasteless, though.
9638000	9649000	Well, yeah, I guess, but at the same time, isn't there someone in the world who's created an art piece out of that?
9649000	9668000	I mean, I remember Super Combine Massacre RPG getting a lot of flack, especially the whole slam dance thing which pretty much blew up in their face with the fact that they supposedly got censored for that game.
9668000	9680000	And then you see how tastelessness basically goes to the extreme in that sense, where you get censored in a festival that goes against the principles.
9680000	9689000	You know, I guess a lot of it just has to kind of do with your interpretation of it, and that goes with games, that goes with art in general.
9689000	9696000	If you want to be offended by it, you will, but if you want to allow yourself to be offended by it, you won't.
9696000	9697000	I don't know if that makes sense.
9697000	9702000	As usual in the world, not everybody can be pleased, apparently.
9702000	9706000	No, sir. Well, anything else on your mind this week, Zaku?
9706000	9726000	Besides DDRX still sucking and just waiting to hopefully, you know, if my local arcade Chinatown Fair apparently follows through on what they said they were about replacing every machine with DDRX, then I'll probably see how bad it is, but it's been pretty much dull on that end.
9726000	9733000	Well, we actually got to ask Konami this week when DDR was going to be fun again, and the response was, wait, please.
9733000	9741000	Wait, please. Do they refer to the arcade version or the home version?
9741000	9742000	Wait, please.
9742000	9746000	Yeah, you ought to love those blanket answers, trying to cover their own ass.
9746000	9750000	Take care, Zaku. Thanks for being on the show. Later.
9750000	9751000	Alright.
9751000	9756000	Do you think he knows that was a reference to his story earlier tonight?
9756000	9759000	I don't know. Alright, 1877 Game OLR.
9759000	9763000	Your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
9763000	9767000	We'll take like one more call, and then we're going to wrap up for the night.
9767000	9769000	Again, that's 877 Game OLR.
9769000	9771000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9771000	9772000	Here comes a call.
9772000	9774000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9774000	9776000	Hi, this is Spazinator here.
9776000	9779000	Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind tonight?
9779000	9786000	Two things. First off, I just want to agree with what you were saying earlier.
9786000	9794000	Yeah, it seems like a lot of people out there, especially in America, have things half-assed backwards.
9794000	9802000	No, you know, whether it be movies or games or whatever, you see people all losing limbs,
9802000	9805000	being decapitated, brutally murdered.
9805000	9811000	But God forbid they show a boob, oh my God, they should go to DEFCON 3.
9811000	9815000	Well, to be fair, there's a lot of people that don't like the violence either,
9815000	9818000	but yeah, it does seem strange in our culture that, you know,
9818000	9822000	and I kind of blame the MPAA at the end of the day,
9822000	9827000	because they're the ones that put the more stringent NC-17 ratings on things that are slightly sexual,
9827000	9830000	whereas, you know, you can have all these violent movies rated R.
9830000	9832000	I think it needs to go one way or the other.
9832000	9835000	Either we need to get some more fucking tits in an R-rated movie,
9835000	9840000	or, and that was fuck and tits, not some fucking tits, although, you know, you can get those too,
9840000	9847000	but we need that in an R-rated movie, or we need these extremely violent movies to be rated NC-17.
9847000	9849000	Give them the kiss of death rating as well.
9849000	9853000	I think you need to go one way or the other. It's just, it's getting ridiculous.
9853000	9859000	Yeah, well, the thing is, you know, not to get all, like, political and whatnot,
9859000	9864000	but, plus, I don't totally remember my history lessons,
9864000	9872000	but I think, at least in part, you know, the country was founded by, like, ultra, ultra, like,
9872000	9882000	conservative, like, Puritans, like, you know, like the Pilgrims, you know, wearing the buckles on their shoes and whatnot.
9882000	9886000	Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
9886000	9893000	Yeah, exactly, and, you know, they were, you know, they were, if I remember my history,
9893000	9898000	you know, they even, they played illegal, you know, because they considered that a form of lying,
9898000	9904000	and, you know, they considered anything involving the body dirty and wrong and all that.
9904000	9907000	Unfortunately, we really haven't gone beyond that.
9907000	9913000	Well, you know what, here's the good news. The good news is that, you know, porn is not illegal.
9913000	9918000	A lot of this stuff is not illegal, like, you know, in the old days, this was, like, you know, again,
9918000	9923000	like, kind of, Dark Soccer was giving the story earlier that if you said fuck, you could get, you know,
9923000	9928000	beat up for saying that, basically. Like, we live in a day and age where at least this shit isn't illegal,
9928000	9935000	and, like, I can sit here on the internet and say fuck, shit, cock, piss, boobs, I can say all of that, you know,
9935000	9940000	and that's a great thing about freedom of speech, which, sadly, not everyone in this world has.
9940000	9947000	But the thing is that we have these governing bodies that put labels on things that are broken and need to be modernized.
9947000	9954000	And the greatest, I mean, the biggest opinion I always use is, or I should say example I always use,
9954000	9960000	is a movie that came out in 1997, 1998, one of my favorite movies ever. It's called Romeo and Michelle's High School Reunion.
9960000	9966000	It's an innocent movie with Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino about these chicks that go to their 10-year high school reunion,
9966000	9969000	and there's a couple sex jokes and they say the word fuck a few times.
9969000	9976000	The movie is rated R. And why? Why is a movie like that rated R? It's practically cartoony in nature.
9976000	9982000	I would let a 13, 14-year-old watch this movie, no problem. Any kid that's old enough to know about sex,
9982000	9989000	I would much rather have them watching this movie on repeat, you know, every day for a summer than watching The Terminator.
9989000	9998000	I really would. You know, it's just, we just, some of these things we have in our culture really need to be modernized. That's all.
9998000	10008000	Yeah, I agree with you. I think even you mentioned this time and time before.
10008000	10021000	Now, real games have really been around for what, 35, 40 years, where movies have been around since early 1900s.
10021000	10028000	You know, there's, you know, people, even my grandparents at age have been going out watching movies,
10028000	10035000	whereas, you know, real games have always been, what, our generation, you know, and younger kids,
10035000	10044000	and there's that kind of disconnect where, you know, the older generations think of real games as these kind of toys,
10044000	10054000	toys for kids, if something is cursing or violence or squaring it, oh my God, no, this is going to be the worst thing ever.
10054000	10057000	It's going to be a downfall of Western civilization.
10057000	10063000	Bazinator, you do make an interesting comparison that when movies were first came out, there was a lot you still couldn't show in movies, either.
10063000	10066000	You know, there was a lot of things that were really taboo to show in movies.
10066000	10074000	You go back and, you know, the first boobies didn't show up in a movie until probably the 50s?
10074000	10075000	And don't even quote me on that.
10075000	10076000	Earlier than that.
10076000	10081000	Well, I don't plan to profess to be a cinema expert, but, you know, it was very taboo.
10081000	10088000	Even if the boobies showed up, it was extremely taboo, just like, you know, seeing a blowjob in a movie is day and age.
10088000	10090000	Video games, I think, just have a way to go.
10090000	10091000	But we need to wrap up.
10091000	10095000	Bazinator, did you have anything else you wanted to share with us?
10095000	10097000	Well, I just want to add one more point.
10097000	10098000	Sure.
10098000	10107000	Conversely, you know, even though boobs are relatively new, you know, there's movies out there that, you know, a century ago weren't acceptable.
10107000	10110000	They're not acceptable now, like Fourth Over Nation.
10110000	10112000	It came out in 1915.
10112000	10114000	It was a KKK movie.
10114000	10116000	They're eating a chance at hell.
10116000	10117000	Good point.
10117000	10121000	There's society taboos that we have overcome.
10121000	10130000	So that's true. You've seen, in some ways, progression where, you know, some of those things that really were inappropriate to show in film have just kind of evolved.
10130000	10132000	At least that's, you know, how we feel about it now.
10132000	10134000	And, you know, rightfully so.
10134000	10137000	Some of the stuff that was very controversial in those movies.
10137000	10139000	Society kind of evolves.
10139000	10143000	But it just seems like with video games, it's evolving slower, and I don't get that.
10143000	10145000	But, Bazinator, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.
10145000	10146000	We appreciate it.
10146000	10147000	Have a good one, buddy, okay?
10147000	10148000	Yep, you too.
10148000	10149000	Okay, later.
10149000	10154000	Alright, we're going to go ahead and wrap up the phone calls tonight, because we want to kind of wrap up the show and get on out of here for the night.
10154000	10159000	But poor Loki's been waiting to do some last-minute stories, and he can take it off by phone calls.
10159000	10161000	Well, do you have any...
10161000	10163000	You're looking into getting that machine shipped, aren't you?
10163000	10165000	I saw you looking at a shipping website.
10165000	10168000	It's actually not a thousand dollars.
10168000	10170000	It hasn't reached its...
10170000	10172000	It hasn't reached its minimum.
10172000	10178000	I'm just looking to see how much it would actually cost to do something like that, because DDR machines are not available anywhere.
10178000	10183000	Unless you're in, like, Korea, and God knows how much it's going to cost to ship from Korea.
10183000	10184000	Right.
10184000	10187000	Well, do you have any last-minute stories for us before we wrap up tonight?
10187000	10188000	Yes, sure, of course.
10188000	10196000	Well, strangely enough, and out of nowhere, and probably going to have the same impact on piracy,
10196000	10200000	MCDoubledefDP has returned.
10200000	10203000	You may not remember him by name, but you'll remember him by song.
10203000	10211000	He had his wonderful online hit of Don't Copy That Floppy, which did absolutely nothing to stop piracy,
10211000	10217000	but now he's back with his Don't Copy That Too, and apparently...
10217000	10219000	Really? I thought that shit was from the 80s.
10219000	10225000	Seriously, he's from the 80s, and basically, based on the little video teaser he has,
10225000	10232000	it looks like if you copy stuff off the internet, well, your parents will be dragged out in the street and beaten to death.
10232000	10234000	Sounds pretty accurate to me.
10234000	10238000	But, uh, yes, awesome.
10238000	10240000	Hold on, I gotta look at this here. Hold on.
10240000	10242000	We have a little preview here.
10242000	10244000	Let's see if I can fast-forward.
10249000	10250000	Oh, this is like a preview or something.
10250000	10252000	No, no, no, no, they go through the song.
10252000	10253000	Just give me a second.
10253000	10255000	I gotta fast-forward then, I guess.
10255000	10268000	No, it's right here.
10268000	10269000	Wow.
10269000	10271000	Fucking joke.
10271000	10272000	Interesting.
10272000	10275000	You missed the beginning part of it, it doesn't just sound like that.
10275000	10276000	Ah, whatever.
10276000	10278000	Yeah, okay.
10278000	10281000	Some dude who's gonna get a lot of hits on his YouTube, congrats.
10281000	10282000	Yeah.
10282000	10286000	Konami is once again innovated on crap.
10286000	10289000	Apparently now they have a brand new game.
10289000	10294000	The only thing going for it is that it has 120 music tracks in it.
10294000	10298000	And including apparently some Bomani songs, I'm not sure.
10298000	10301000	But the game is called Walk It Out.
10301000	10308000	Yes, Konami has created a game for the Wii that is about walking outdoors.
10308000	10310000	Nice.
10310000	10311000	Yeah.
10311000	10313000	Seriously?
10313000	10315000	Really?
10315000	10316000	Walking outdoors?
10316000	10320000	But apparently it is a rhythm game, so you know, you have to step to the beat.
10320000	10321000	So there is a game in it.
10321000	10325000	There is a game to it, but it's walking outdoors.
10325000	10326000	Come on.
10326000	10328000	Really?
10328000	10330000	I do that for school credit.
10330000	10332000	You play the game, going to buy the game.
10332000	10334000	I mean, ugh.
10334000	10335000	Anyways.
10335000	10337000	On my YouTube project this week, we went outdoors.
10337000	10340000	It was a lot of fun, actually.
10340000	10345000	Myst will be coming to the Playstation Network for PSP July 16th.
10345000	10349000	And that's kind of neat.
10349000	10352000	Apparently there's a new MechWarrior game coming out.
10352000	10359000	They announced after a few little teases that MechWarrior 5, well technically MechWarrior 5,
10359000	10364000	but it's now going to be called MechWarrior, will be coming out from Smith & Tinker,
10364000	10372000	which is actually founded by FASA co-founder Jordan Weisman and Piranha Games.
10372000	10376000	And apparently it's going to be coming out on PC and Xbox 360.
10376000	10382000	And we'll have a single player campaign as well as a four player co-op campaign.
10382000	10383000	That's awesome.
10383000	10384000	Nice.
10384000	10386000	We'll have a $200 controller too.
10386000	10387000	That's optional.
10387000	10388000	Remember that.
10388000	10389000	They never had that for...
10389000	10390000	That was something else.
10390000	10391000	But that was a mech game, wasn't it?
10391000	10393000	It was a mech game, but it's not this mech game.
10393000	10395000	I know it's not that mech game, but it was some other game.
10395000	10402000	Also, Smith & Tinker has authorized MechTech to distribute MechWarrior 4,
10402000	10405000	along with its expansions, for free, on the internet.
10405000	10407000	Thank you, Chatters, GS68, Steel Battalion.
10407000	10409000	That was the game I was trying to think of.
10409000	10411000	On the internet.
10411000	10416000	So you'll actually be able to play MechWarrior 4 for free on BattleTech.com soon enough.
10416000	10419000	You know what we need in this world?
10419000	10421000	Real mechs.
10421000	10422000	That's what we need.
10422000	10426000	How much would you pay to go to a place that was like an arena
10426000	10428000	where nobody would really get hurt or really get blown up?
10428000	10430000	It would be like laser tag, all right?
10430000	10433000	But you would have real mechs that you would crawl into and get in.
10433000	10435000	You mean robot jocks?
10435000	10438000	Something like that, where you would actually crawl in these giant machines.
10438000	10440000	And I'm not talking about the shit of Dave & Busters.
10440000	10443000	You would actually walk around a giant arena outside
10443000	10447000	with bales of hay, obstacles, and stuff like that,
10447000	10449000	and go around and shoot people.
10449000	10451000	No, I'm talking about a real fucking mech.
10451000	10454000	That would be fucking hot shit right there.
10454000	10456000	I would pay lots of money to do that.
10456000	10457000	And so would you.
10457000	10459000	Yes, but can you imagine if they maintained them
10459000	10463000	like they do arcade games that are in some of these family fun centers?
10463000	10466000	My mech's missing my leg. I can't turn.
10466000	10467000	I'm running in circles.
10467000	10469000	I can't do it, Captain. I don't have the power.
10469000	10472000	I can't fire. I've fallen over.
10472000	10476000	Jason in chat says they have real mechs.
10476000	10479000	There was a real Gundam in Japan, life size.
10479000	10484000	Yeah, they actually do have one, and they were also working on...
10484000	10488000	They did a Gigantor in another town.
10488000	10490000	The Gundam was outside Tokyo.
10490000	10493000	The mere thought gives me a semi.
10493000	10497000	Carcassonne's coming to DS.
10497000	10499000	That's kind of neat.
10499000	10500000	That game's fun.
10500000	10507000	Really, it needs to be some other game.
10507000	10509000	Oh, great. I totally forgot the name of the game.
10509000	10510000	The other?
10510000	10512000	The other game that's similar to this game
10512000	10516000	that's also another board game turned Xbox Live arcade game
10516000	10518000	that I can't remember, but I played a lot of
10518000	10521000	and played a lot of the board game, and just...
10521000	10522000	Ah!
10522000	10524000	What was the other one? I can't even remember, too.
10524000	10526000	There was Carcassonne, and there was...
10526000	10528000	God, there was all the expansions for it, too.
10528000	10530000	Somebody in chat will yell it out.
10530000	10532000	Catan, Settlers of Catan. Thank you.
10532000	10534000	Thank you. That's what needs to be on there.
10534000	10538000	And I need memory in my brain.
10538000	10543000	Also, the PlayStation Network will be getting manga as well.
10543000	10545000	They're actually going to get some downloadable comics.
10545000	10548000	Of course, this has only been announced for the Japanese markets,
10548000	10550000	but why not? Why not put it over here?
10550000	10552000	You know what? Neat idea.
10552000	10554000	I actually think that's a neat idea.
10554000	10556000	It's a little weird, but why not?
10556000	10558000	We have these Amazon e-reader books.
10558000	10561000	Why not manga on your PSP? Why not?
10561000	10562000	Yeah, that'd be cool.
10562000	10563000	Didn't we see some of this, actually?
10563000	10565000	I thought there were some games that came out,
10565000	10567000	not that long ago, that were kind of like this,
10567000	10570000	like $20 comic books on the PSP.
10570000	10572000	Yeah, you're talking about the Metal Gear Solid motion comics.
10572000	10573000	Yeah, remember that?
10573000	10574000	Yeah.
10574000	10576000	Yeah, I mean, why not?
10576000	10582000	There's a brand new mod for Half-Life 2, Neo Tokyo,
10582000	10585000	which is actually, I believe, like a Tolkien version of the game.
10585000	10592000	It's been released for the Source software development kit,
10592000	10595000	and I think it will be available on Steam.
10595000	10601000	It's actually been in the works for five years now,
10601000	10606000	and kind of is inspired by Ghost in the Shell, Akira, that type of stuff,
10606000	10608000	but it's an all multiplayer game,
10608000	10611000	and the trailer for it is friggin' awesome,
10611000	10613000	so definitely worth checking out.
10613000	10615000	You can actually download it on their client page,
10615000	10618000	neotokiohq.com.
10618000	10621000	Check it out there. It looks pretty sweet.
10621000	10628000	Also, I think a while back we saw there was a graffiti type device
10628000	10631000	created using the Wii Remote,
10631000	10636000	sort of using similar things as the John Cho stuff,
10636000	10640000	where he created the virtual light boards.
10640000	10643000	Well, now you have the interactive white board thing
10643000	10646000	using a Wii spray can,
10646000	10653000	and actually apparently won a design prize in Germany,
10653000	10655000	which is pretty cool.
10655000	10659000	Held by the German firm International Forum Design,
10659000	10665000	Wii Spray was one of the 377 finalists of the prestigious award.
10665000	10671000	That's a lot of finalists, but okay.
10671000	10677000	And then finally, Medal of Honor Heroes
10677000	10681000	is the latest game on the PSP to be exploited
10681000	10685000	to enable custom firmware in homebrew,
10685000	10688000	and yes, this also works.
10688000	10690000	Actually, they've tested it on the PSP-1000.
10690000	10693000	I think it also works on the 3000,
10693000	10696000	but once again, going back to the beginning of this show
10696000	10700000	and discussion about countermeasures for piracy
10700000	10703000	and that type of thing, no matter how hard you try,
10703000	10705000	there's someone always trying harder.
10705000	10708000	And that goes for both sides.
10708000	10710000	All right, a little lesson learned on tonight's show.
10710000	10711000	There you go.
10711000	10712000	The more you know.
10712000	10714000	Yes, indeed, the more you know.
10714000	10718000	All right, well, I guess that's going to wrap it up for tonight's show,
10718000	10720000	and before we say good night, though,
10720000	10722000	we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10722000	10724000	So Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight
10724000	10726000	as you enjoy The Sims 3 for the rest of the evening?
10726000	10728000	I'm spray painting sand.
10728000	10729000	That's that noise I hear.
10729000	10730000	Yes.
10730000	10731000	What color are you spraying sand?
10731000	10734000	I'm actually turning the ground into sand.
10734000	10737000	I'm using the terrain paint.
10737000	10739000	My final thought is I'm actually kind of craving Del Taco,
10739000	10742000	and I'm hoping the one in Rockland is open late.
10742000	10746000	So I'm driving out there tonight, so I want Del Taco.
10746000	10747000	Mmm, Del Taco.
10747000	10750000	Loki, your final thought?
10750000	10754000	My final thought is I need to play more games this week,
10754000	10756000	but in the absence of playing games,
10756000	10759000	I've been unpacking, and I'm almost done.
10759000	10760000	All righty.
10760000	10762000	Hey, thank you guys so much for downloading our show
10762000	10765000	and tuning in to us and supporting independent broadcasting.

10775000	10776000	Radio?
10776000	10777000	Radio.
10777000	10779000	Leave us nice reviews on websites as well.
10779000	10780000	That always goes a long way,
10780000	10782000	especially when there's asshats out there that leave reviews on the show
10782000	10784000	that clearly haven't even listened to it.
10784000	10787000	Nothing will piss you off like that.
10787000	10790000	iTunes, you need to let us review reviewers.
10790000	10791000	We demand it.
10791000	10794000	Anyhow, that's going to do it for another week here on Orange Launch Radio.
