13919	18425	Tonight, July 12, 2009, can piracy lead to malware on your DS?
18745	24854	The Tomb Raider franchise looks ready for a reboot, and could you soon play Rock Band or Guitar Hero with no gaming console?
31718	35460	Hello, Internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35520	42024	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42545	47448	And here to do it with you guys every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-hosts.
47768	50350	Joining me tonight, the one and only Techmaster Loki in the house.
51010	51250	Hello.
51471	52152	How you doing, Loki?
52492	52893	Doing good.
53313	53613	Awesome.
54074	56938	And DarkSakura is joining us a little bit late.
57118	68192	She is in her summer class right now, and as you know, she's been having to join us late for some of the shows because she has some type of outdoor activity she has to do, some type of PE class, so she, I think, some type of...
68953	69353	DarkSakura.com.
85740	111514	Phone lines 1-877-GAME-OLR Our email bag, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com It's not just about us, it's about you guys We are the place where every gamer has a voice Anyhow, it's been a fun week, I hope, for you guys out there Just another summer week for those of you folks that are on a break from school or what have you I hope you're making the most of it and getting some good gaming time in We're going to start off the show tonight as we always do, talking about our gaming weeks a little bit Loki, how was your gaming week?
112214	119057	I was just playing Grand Theft Auto 4, just still tweaking the editing to make sure everything's balanced.
119617	131783	I was creating one weapon that's basically a nuke, and it wasn't getting to the size that a nuke should be, or at least, you know, relatively in scale.
131843	139386	Obviously, if I actually created a full-size nuke in the game, that would kind of be pointless since it would destroy the entire map.
140007	140227	But, um...
141708	146851	I want something a little bit bigger than say 20 square feet or something like that.
147391	150093	So I'm working on making that a little bit bigger.
150133	152114	I think I figured out a way to do it.
152894	163600	But it's funny because we just can't stop giggling once we fire that and the whole screen gets really this big bright green glow and everything like explodes and it's funny.
164200	170804	But yeah, the game has gotten so ridiculous now that it's just an absolute blast and really kind of
172418	174260	Not resembling Grand Theft Auto anymore.
176201	178983	You talk a lot about your Grand Theft Auto playing on the show.
179143	182886	I think we all kind of have the grasp that you do this on your lunch break at work.
182906	185709	Lunch break and our 15-minute break.
185749	187250	Wow, so it's all gaming.
187790	192454	Again, for those folks that are new to Orange Lingerie and maybe haven't listened before, Loki works in game distribution.
192494	196537	So he literally, for eight hours a day, kind of eats, lives, sleeps video games.
197037	199019	But it's not as glamorous.
199079	199499	No, not even.
214921	216262	Wild Dark Sakura is approaching.
216662	217583	Quick, throw the pester ball.
219384	221325	She just got out of the shower.
224487	225667	She'll be joining us in just a moment.
226188	228109	She came in to make faces in the studio.
228169	232211	You play actual video games on your lunch break to decompress and stuff.
232631	235713	The guys you play with, are they all also game salesmen?
235993	236454	What's the deal?
237114	238275	Well, here's the deal.
239435	240896	One way or another, they sort of are.
240976	246238	I mean, before we used to have a mix, we had just all of our game reps playing.
246899	252461	Right now, we have myself, my friend Jason, who actually moved into the games department, so now he's a game sales rep.
253782	260965	Our friend Rob Nelson, who's in our video sales department, but way back in the day, he was actually in game sales, and he likes games, so that's cool.
261045	264307	And then my boss, Rob, who's also...
264867	267008	Wait, so you play video games on lunch with your boss?
267128	267428	Yeah.
267448	268369	That's actually kind of cool.
269209	270209	Your job ain't so bad.
270790	272750	You know, but I kick the crap out of him.
272951	273371	A lot.
274331	274771	Nice.
275232	277953	I wish I could play, like, Grand Theft Auto with my boss.
278453	281374	But the thing is... Of course, I don't think she really plays video games.
281394	287217	But see, now, you know, because we play on the consoles that I own, I've modded all those consoles, so now I can take...
287937	289777	An image of Grand Theft Auto 4.
290258	303441	Granted, I have bought copies, so I guess sort of it's legal, because I do actually own enough copies for all the systems, and I actually have lost and damned on all the systems, so that's pretty expensive.
304041	312943	But yeah, so we actually do play their modified copies of Grand Theft Auto 4, but we play with our own rule set, and you know...
314096	314696	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
329164	330145	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
345564	346865	Video Capture Device
367873	368714	Yeah, it's nuts.
393473	394073	Overseas.
394194	396915	Naughty, naughty, but no, we appreciate the support either way.
396955	398276	Just don't get fired over Orange Lounge Radio.
398616	406381	But, you know, we'd have some folks that would listen, and I know they were using JustinTV to do it, so... And some folks, for whatever weird reason, like to look at us while we're doing this.
406741	409042	But we would also, like, play video games, usually during the show.
409082	418868	I know towards the end there, before the summer months, we would, like, kind of show games before they were actually out, because Loki is also a crazy import gamer, and would get a lot of games from Japan that he can play on his Wii.
419249	419369	So...
420189	421090	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
438087	442831	or we're going to go back to studio my place and the place that's there.
443131	455822	So either way, we're looking at getting a more intricate setup with Justin TV where we're going to have a switchboard where we can go between like a shot of us in studio, a shot of the game we're playing, maybe something that's a zoom in on the guest or something like that.
456142	459285	Kind of some multi-camera angles, believe it or not, should be interesting.
459665	460385	So we'll see what happens.
460846	462407	That is hopefully in the future.
462627	465710	Anyway, I didn't mean to derail your gaming week, Loki, but I don't know if you have anything else.
466343	468564	Deathwishing says I should make a gun that shoots fish.
468804	471265	Can't do that, unfortunately, in Grand Theft Auto.
471285	474866	You can make guns that shoot a lot of things, but fish is not one of those things.
475667	478628	TigerClaw is asking why not Studio Loki if it exists?
478708	483229	Well, I just think with babies on the way, Studio Loki is not really going to be a viable option.
483249	485690	Plus, I don't think you have really any extra space there.
485710	487371	A middle bedroom, but it's kind of...
488280	488560	Small.
489220	490181	Well, so is this space.
490241	490881	We make this work.
490941	493501	Yeah, actually, it would be bigger than this space.
494542	501684	I think Studio Loki is always a possibility in a situation where one of us is going to be gone or something, but especially once Loki has the kids there.
501704	502744	I will have an HDTV in there.
503124	503424	Nice.
503464	503904	Hopefully.
503924	506085	The wife keeps saying that I can't put it in there.
506125	507425	She's like, well, you have to put it in our bedroom.
507445	509706	I'm like, well, I don't have cable blocks for that, so...
510566	513548	DarkSakura is toweling off from the shower.
513588	515229	In fact, she's wearing nothing but a towel right now.
515670	517711	Too bad that we don't have that, JustinTV.
517731	519212	Whatever.
519452	519933	No, she's not.
520433	523695	She's wearing very unglamorous sweatpants and a DDR Spot t-shirt.
524836	525596	These aren't sweatpants.
525616	527338	These are actually comfortable man pajamas.
527438	527778	I'm sorry.
528258	529499	From a distance, they look like sweatpants.
529519	530400	What's on your mind, DarkSakura?
530420	530880	How are you doing?
531160	539306	Well, I was actually going to say, we actually had another idea about doing some rearranging that would involve opening up a whole wall in this room.
539606	539966	Dang.
540504	548809	So that would give us, in fact, it was actually almost specifically for us using this as a studio full time.
549550	551070	So we would be making some more room in here.
551090	556434	We're actually thinking about moving the pinballs into that room and moving our living room into the pinball room.
557154	565679	And for that sake, that actually moves the subwoofer from away from that back wall so that we're not getting, oh, and by the way, Sega did BOOM!
567480	569882	I look forward to the week where Sega does BOOM!
571644	573266	That would be a great video game, actually.
573346	574407	Just call it Boom!
574787	575708	With an explanation.
575988	577790	Copyright Orange Jones Radio 2009.
577990	581133	We haven't had a dream game in a long time called Boom.
582114	584336	It just needs to be called Subwoofer Noise.
586001	586661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
602639	608023	Sorry, my little brother, Phillip, so cute when he was little, then he grew up, what happened?
609684	612265	He used to call it the Hoover Darn, because dam was a bad word.
612285	613426	Because dam's a bad word, right.
613466	616768	Yeah, so I sort of inherited calling it the Hoover Darn.
616888	626234	But anyway, we went to the Hoover Dam, and it was hot, and there was water.
627654	629275	I took pictures of said water.
629476	631597	Thank God you're here, because I would have never known that.
632333	632833	Oh, whatever.
633593	634753	God, where the hell is my IRC?
634893	635094	Okay.
636314	650596	Anyway, we got lots of frozen yogurt, and I had a few very cool new experiences and met cool people that I had heard of but never got to see, so it was pretty cool.
650616	651577	I had a very good time.
651917	653137	Wait, did you meet OLR listeners?
653817	654797	Or were these, like, other people?
654857	655237	Other people.
655257	656017	Oh, okay, okay.
656057	657318	Because I went to go see Sauce.
657618	658678	Okay, because tiara friends.
658698	659058	Yeah.
659098	659498	Okay, okay.
660382	664344	and I had really a great, great time.
664484	666946	It was very relaxing to watch the first season of Dexter.
668066	668887	I love that show.
669647	672088	And watch the first season of True Blood.
672508	673589	I love that show too.
675110	677811	And I finally got to see Repo the Genetic Opera.
678011	678291	Yes.
678712	681313	God, I love Anthony Head in that.
681713	682754	He's just like, oh!
683114	684095	I love Repo in general.
684175	688417	And it's the only thing I've seen Sarah Brightman in that her voice hasn't irritated me.
689142	690363	Oh, she's amazing.
690383	698449	By the way, if you've listened to the show for any length of time, or I guess I should say a long time, you know that I've been involved with Rocky Horror Picture Show for a long time.
698489	707916	And Repo really is kind of like a lot like it, in a sense, where it's that very glamorous musical type thing.
707956	709176	So I love Repo.
709216	709777	It's awesome.
710577	712699	I really do enjoy it.
712819	716762	I'm going to have to pick that up on Blu-ray so I can watch it in all the HD glory.
717492	719732	I have an extra copy on Blu-ray if you want to buy one cheap.
719852	721713	Because I got an extra one for my birthday.
722233	723493	So if you're interested in it, let me know.
723513	728334	I'm interested in it.
729214	731415	I also actually did a little bit of gaming.
732095	733835	I actually bought some games that we never got to play.
734315	737516	But I got my SNES emulator running on Linux.
738876	743497	And I played some of the game that we'll be talking about later.
743948	746552	I see, so we're going to have an inspired Classic Game of the Week this week.
746672	747394	Yes, we will.
747894	750098	And it's not Captain America and the Avengers.
751340	752942	We did purchase that, actually.
753063	754405	Dan and I did when I got back.
754839	760702	Goldanthro in our chatroom at chat.orangelearnsradio.com put, Lol, my mom is watching True Blood right now in my family's living room.
760762	761202	No joke.
761222	761963	She loves that show.
762223	763083	God, that show's awesome.
763103	766985	True Blood is also a trending topic on Twitter right now, I noticed, as I'm checking the ULR account.
767005	767846	So it must be a good show.
768186	768886	I've never watched it.
769126	769907	It's pretty good.
770027	770627	It's pretty good.
770907	773649	It's just something you'll have to watch.
773709	776170	It's its own type of... It's like vampires and stuff, right?
776190	777931	Yeah, but it's vampires going public.
778536	778937	Interesting.
779077	779257	Okay.
779657	782260	It's got a lot of human rights parallels and different things.
782380	783902	So like Heroes, but with vampires?
784643	785484	I didn't watch Heroes.
785624	785944	Oh, okay.
785964	787406	So that's kind of lost on me.
789548	793112	But we also saw Drag Me to Hell.
795295	798278	And we paid $2 a piece for it, so it was well worth the money.
799466	805832	Um, it was like, I think either that or The Hangover, and I hate stupid type of- Buddy comedies?
806192	806833	I really do.
806993	808354	I really don't like this kind of movies.
808935	812077	And while other people may love them to death, that's fine.
812358	815540	I'm not saying that your taste is awful, I'm just saying that's not my kind of thing.
816081	821786	So, um, but, going to see a Sam Raimi movie, you know, how can you go wrong with Sam Raimi?
821986	823127	Loki's dying to say something.
823387	825249	I was just going to say what I saw this week too.
825329	828552	I saw Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen, and Bruno.
829172	831835	And I never have I seen so many people walk out of Bruno.
832735	833396	It was hilarious.
834057	839301	I'm iffy on Bruno because I have this bad feeling I'm going to get really offended even though I usually find that kind of stuff funny.
839481	840082	It was funny.
840242	841123	I'm waiting for Blu-ray.
841163	841744	I'm waiting for Blu-ray.
861463	862704	Pink Penguin and a Tutu
878021	882843	I'm not sure how to take this because, you know, sure, I'm gay or whatever, but I like to think I'm still a guy.
882863	884164	Because you like penguins.
884184	884704	I do love penguins.
884764	886265	I should tell you why it made me think of you.
886285	886505	Why?
886825	887825	Because of Rocky.
887845	889086	It's true.
889706	894088	When he did the cell block pingo.
894348	895889	Oh, God, that was so many years ago.
896269	896909	Okay, yeah, yeah.
896929	898590	And you were wearing the little pink thing too.
898630	903572	You know, you're not helping my whole manly man case here, so you wouldn't mind telling us about the rest of your gaming week.
903592	904273	And you like penguins.
905173	908015	But it wasn't... Don't jump to conclusions.
909916	910276	Anyway.
911777	913418	I played a lot of pinball.
913458	914699	We went to the Pinball Hall of Fame.
915780	919382	And I was in pain by the time we were done, but it was well worth the agony.
920342	923404	I played the worst pinball table ever, and it's also one of the most rare.
924084	925565	I played pinball circus.
926486	927186	It's crap.
928647	931409	It's worth playing once, but it's crap.
931509	933390	And that's probably why they only made two of them.
934811	941055	I actually went and played a really good Black Knight 2000.
941756	944298	Because, you know, I've got the table, but ours is kind of messed up.
944378	949301	So playing on our messed up table here helped my skills on the really nice table there.
950262	957867	And Tiara and I took turns, sort of, on the longest multi-ball session ever.
958747	960168	of Star Trek The Next Generation.
961089	962890	And I played the Data East Star Trek pinball.
962950	966432	I played... I did not play Captain Fantastic, sorry.
967212	970034	But I did play Theater of Magic.
970434	972696	And I played Medieval Madness.
973436	974156	I played...
976118	979180	The Super Mario Brothers pinball table.
979360	980681	The adult one, not the child one.
982242	985185	And I played Bride of Pinbot and Pinbot.
985225	986225	They didn't have a jackpot.
987066	990128	I wandered around the place twice looking for a jackpot, but they didn't have one.
990549	991650	But it's okay.
991670	992410	They had Doctor Who.
992430	993111	I didn't play, though.
993791	994492	No, where is this place?
994532	994812	I'm sorry.
994852	995452	I missed that part.
995472	996653	It's the Pinball Hall of Fame.
996833	997874	Oh my god, awesome.
997954	999676	And we drove by the Liberace Museum.
1000136	1002218	And all I could think of was, my mom would like this.
1002978	1005239	Go to the Pinball Hall of Fame Go to the Pinball Hall of Fame
1030390	1036593	and you have to eat at this place that Tiara took me to called, I think it's Toto's.
1037474	1039115	It's like a margarita brunch.
1039555	1042016	Well, you know I'm going to go visit Sauce if I'm there.
1042196	1043177	It's not on the strip.
1044197	1045438	We avoided the strip like plague.
1045458	1047799	Well, I'll make Sauce take us out to all the nice places.
1049620	1050941	Anyhow.
1051061	1053482	We had a very, very good time.
1055263	1058185	I got woken up by a kitten a lot.
1059565	1060286	Dan in the Bed
1076921	1077763	Oh, DVDs!
1078624	1080406	So it was pretty cool.
1080426	1090421	But I had a great time, and I have to thank her and her family for putting up with me for the time I was there.
1090461	1091202	I had a great time.
1091897	1092197	Excellent.
1092217	1093779	Well, I'm glad you had fun in Vegas.
1093839	1097381	And now I know all the good stuff I need to go do, hopefully, if I go visit before the end of the year.
1097842	1101465	But it's just making his schedule work and my schedule work because he's going to art school now.
1101485	1102345	He starts art school Monday.
1102606	1102806	Really?
1102826	1103286	Believe it or not.
1103306	1108170	Yes, he's... You're going to have to forget that whole manly man thing I was mentioning earlier.
1108230	1110032	He's studying to be an interior designer.
1110352	1110732	Cool.
1111193	1112934	No, I think that's awesome.
1113014	1115056	I would love to sit down and talk with him.
1115316	1116076	I'm so supportive.
1116377	1116957	It's going to be awesome.
1116997	1121401	I would actually love to sit down and talk with him about fabric for a project I'm doing.
1122157	1126138	He would probably love to talk that shop, especially once he's had some of his classes down.
1126158	1127018	Cool.
1127038	1127638	That's pretty neat.
1128419	1130439	Anyhow, enough about that.
1130479	1135020	Let me talk about the stuff that I've been doing this week in regards to video games.
1136100	1137461	I played pretty much two video games.
1137501	1146183	I went back to play Final Fantasy IV The After Years because, as you know, I beat the main scenario, but now there's all the spin-off scenarios, so I actually beat the Rydia scenario, which...
1146923	1147323	and DarkSakura.
1170404	1172247	Like you were playing an outline?
1186286	1187007	Yeah, basically.
1187027	1190229	But the main story felt there were more twists and things that made it interesting.
1190289	1202118	I love, love the twist at the end of the main story because it involves introducing a new class to the game, which I love the idea of, and I hope one shows up in Final Fantasy XIV.
1202458	1203599	I'm not going to spoil it.
1203939	1205760	If you really want to know, go play it.
1205840	1206841	But there's a new class.
1207041	1208682	It's a combination of two existing classes.
1208702	1209203	I think it's awesome.
1209223	1210844	You'll have to tell me off the air because I'm poor.
1210864	1211044	I will.
1211184	1212225	LOST ODYSSEY
1231838	1232860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1247981	1248661	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1276198	1276758	Thanks for watching!
1292663	1294545	So yeah, I love Lost Odyssey.
1295045	1301170	I am about caught up to where I was before, which is where I'm right at the end of the first disc, and I've got three more discs to go.
1301470	1310938	So you'll probably be hearing about this game over the next month or so as I play a little more each week to try and beat it, because I want to see what happens at the end of the story, because I never played that far before.
1310978	1315922	I got sucked into raiding and wow, or moved on to another game, because I think it came out during a busy period.
1315962	1316963	But yeah, Lost Odyssey.
1317983	1319283	Sadly Overlooked RPG on the 360.
1320204	1321384	I don't know why haters hated it.
1321424	1326705	Well, I think maybe they hated it because in some ways it's kind of linear and a little more restrictive.
1326825	1335947	It's the more Final Fantasy X style of there's no world map, but you go to select areas and the areas are their own little maps, if that makes sense.
1336047	1336387	I don't know.
1338748	1340208	I still enjoy the game.
1340948	1342028	So, uh, yep.
1342209	1343889	Anyhow, that was pretty much my game of the week.
1343909	1345070	It was really just those two games.
1345110	1346850	I didn't play anything new new that came out.
1346910	1349231	No new Xbox Live Arcade games or anything like that.
1349531	1351072	I don't even remember what came out this week.
1351732	1352432	Was this a big week?
1352833	1355514	I heard now, I heard that Madballs game is out next week.
1355834	1356634	You know where I heard that?
1357614	1358695	On a Facebook ad.
1359744	1362665	Actdeft in chatroom asks Will Rob finish the game or will his gamer ADD kick in the middle of the game?
1362685	1363066	Stay tuned to OLR
1382215	1390608	DarkCharger in chat says those dream sequences in Lost Odyssey were one of the best things about the game it's too bad none of them were actually visualized or maybe that was a good thing
1391567	1392267	Good point.
1392667	1396369	I think in some ways those stories were best left to the imagination.
1397049	1397949	It's like reading a book.
1398049	1398910	Why do you read a book?
1398970	1400910	So you can make up your own visualizations.
1401450	1415295	But the cool thing about it was that it did things that books can't do with the text and the music and the backgrounds that you would see and the shifts in the backgrounds that did add some visual impact, but without showing you what people look like.
1415515	1416776	It was like deep thoughts.
1417656	1422038	In a way, it was, but you make it sound so stupid, and I'm sorry, it was awesome.
1423079	1424540	Haters gonna hate, I don't even care.
1424940	1432124	Alright, before we get into some gaming news tonight and gaming discussion, we want to take care of some housekeeping, of which we don't have a whole lot of right now.
1432544	1434505	No shows off in the near future or anything like that.
1434845	1437546	Still no idea what's going on for PAX, if anything.
1437586	1439727	I think both Loki and DarkSakura are out.
1440328	1442169	I sadly may have to skip it, too.
1443189	1445570	I don't want to though, I'm still going to try and make it work.
1445950	1450272	It's just the week right after my crazy week in Reno that I have planned.
1450632	1452113	So yeah, crazy crazy.
1453213	1456635	But I'm still hoping to do PAX, I should know in the next couple weeks.
1457055	1460216	So I would love to see you guys at PAX if that happens.
1460656	1462317	Otherwise, we'll keep you posted here.
1462697	1465039	Join our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1465119	1467341	We've been getting some ads this week and really appreciate it.
1468041	1472625	And then of course we have our live journal community at Orange Lounge and our Facebook group, the OL Army.
1473065	1476048	And I would plug MySpace too, but does anyone really use that anymore?
1476628	1477869	Alright, that's it.
1477909	1479551	Let's move into some gaming news tonight.
1479851	1480952	Loki, start us off.
1481252	1489982	Yes, there is a big ol' rumor, or possibly leak, I guess, of a relaunch of the Tomb Raider series.
1490042	1493406	And now I know you're thinking, hey, wait a second, didn't that already happen?
1494107	1494788	Yes, it did.
1494988	1500335	But hey, let's relaunch it again, because, you know, the first relaunch didn't quite work out for them.
1501035	1501196	So...
1501696	1502217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1516773	1517694	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1547168	1554410	It is oddly deserted, and an uneasy feeling settles as strange sounds emerge from the shadows.
1554891	1569015	With only her determination, inner strength, and resourcefulness to help her, Laura must overcome the challenge of harsh and unforgiving journeys that will take her across a vast island wilderness and into deep...
1570666	1573688	Deep, Claustrophobic, and Menacing Underground Tombs.
1573748	1576589	Felicia's actually going to be in tombs in Tomb Raider.
1576729	1580231	So it's more of like a scary game, and that's what GameGuru says in chat.
1580271	1582892	It's rumored to be survival horror, and I think that's stupid.
1583512	1587254	Yes, and they're also saying, I guess, you know...
1588436	1589257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1612063	1625276	and, you know, you gotta love the survey leaks, but Joystick, the blog that ran the story, they actually were contacted by the Nielsen Entertainment Group to remove the image and the story.
1625456	1627998	Now, Nielsen, like the ratings people on television, right?
1628178	1628999	Like the Nielsen ratings?
1629339	1629980	I guess.
1630120	1630460	Interesting.
1630661	1632803	I mean, they have a similar name.
1633643	1633764	Um...
1634867	1635688	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1649502	1654206	Crystal Dynamics is hiring folks to work on an installment of a AAA franchise.
1672442	1681265	Toby Gard, the series creator, is a leading design group for an unannounced project and Eidos is terrible at keeping its secret games under wraps.
1683266	1683506	Funny.
1684407	1690969	But yeah, it's probably going to happen and I bet you anything next year you'll have another Tomb Raider game that hopefully won't suck as much as the last one.
1692216	1697320	Tomb Raider's interesting because Tomb Raider, I remember Tomb Raider 2 and the original Tomb Raider.
1697380	1700222	Those were really revolutionary PC games back in the day.
1700562	1702643	But that franchise, to me anyway, I don't know.
1702723	1704525	I'm sorry, chatters, if we have Tomb Raider fans.
1704825	1709508	But the franchise really kind of, it felt like so much more of the same, more of the same.
1710028	1716253	And that whole 3D platformer thing was so overdone, I think, amongst the PlayStation 2 and so forth.
1716993	1717874	The whole thing felt very...
1719258	1720719	to me, like, you know, after a while.
1721040	1728826	And, you know, whereas I think those original games were very revolutionary, I think the later ones just bored the shit out of me, and I had no interest in playing them.
1729186	1734491	So it's very interesting to me, well, A, that this is a reboot of a reboot of a reboot at this point, right?
1735011	1740115	And that if they're changing the genre up a little bit, that's really interesting to me as well.
1740456	1747722	The fact that they might be going a more survival horror route, which seems to be, I guess, all the rage these days with your, you know, Saw and your...
1748422	1750063	Silent Hill and your Resident Evils.
1750364	1757770	It's even funny, though, because when I saw the picture of Lara Croft, it reminded me of someone from Resident Evil.
1757810	1761513	I mean, the look of it looked very much like Jill or something.
1761553	1761973	I don't know.
1762654	1766457	Well, what's interesting is that they're talking about doing a movie franchise reboot, too, right?
1766557	1767938	Could this be playing into that at all?
1768218	1770100	Could the movie franchise be going more...
1770680	1771020	I don't know.
1771040	1771941	It's the thing, you know,
1800871	1805333	To me, I don't give a crap if they reboot this because I have lost interest in this series.
1805433	1810035	Actually, I never had interest in this series, so... Great!
1810416	1814598	You know, I'd like to see them try something different, but it's not going to probably get me to play it.
1815498	1815778	But hey.
1815978	1817399	But what if the game is really good, Loki?
1817419	1820701	What if you hear it's as awesome as Resident Evil 4 or something?
1820741	1823102	I didn't care for Resident Evil 4 either.
1823122	1827124	Of course, I didn't play Resident Evil 4, but I don't care for Resident Evil.
1827424	1827724	I just...
1829474	1829934	I don't know.
1829954	1831775	Okay, what if it plays like Grand Theft Auto 4?
1832116	1833757	It will never play like Grand Theft Auto 4.
1834377	1834897	I'm sorry.
1836959	1837339	Alright.
1837799	1840841	TigerClaw in chat says, Megan Fox would have to do the English accent.
1840981	1843323	Angelina Jolie does have a pretty good English accent.
1844103	1847985	Joshi16 says, Megan Fox would have to actually do something interesting.
1849186	1850447	Xlink says, the hell with this.
1850487	1851708	Where's my pressure luck game?
1853948	1855029	You have that.
1855309	1856190	I know, there is that DVD game.
1856210	1856690	I got that for you.
1856770	1861853	I guess that shows how many people actually care about Tomb Raider, at least in our chat room, if our chat is any indication.
1861933	1867336	I'm sorry, it was all about Tomb Raider 2, locking the butler in the freezer, and then breaking Lara Croft's neck.
1867456	1868677	It was all about Topless Mod.
1870158	1879583	Because that was really the start of that whole craze of every game on the PC has a booby mod, and it was Tomb Raider, the old school Tomb Raider where you could run around as naked Lara.
1880284	1880404	So...
1881576	1886597	Anyhow, alright, I guess a lot of our folks don't really seem to care about the whole Tomb Raider reboot.
1886637	1887218	Well, there you go.
1887618	1889778	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you disagree.
1890418	1893739	Before I get into the next story, I want to mention this chat comment from earlier.
1894140	1898161	RobX327 in chat says, Hey Rob, a big game did come out this week.
1898581	1901902	Battlefield 1943 on Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.
1902242	1904882	See, not really my type of game, but good point.
1904902	1906863	I know there's tons of people that are really into Battlefield.
1907163	1909544	That had a really long line at E3 as well.
1909564	1910084	I remember that.
1911064	1912925	I kept giving them away and I never got one.
1913186	1915767	Not that I would have played it anyway.
1915787	1917208	It's just not my kind of game.
1917408	1919409	No disrespect to those who enjoy it.
1919489	1924732	I tried to play Battlefield 1942, I think, and I was just really terrible at it.
1924872	1926373	I tried playing that on the PC.
1926413	1928454	I'm just not very good at those kind of games.
1929074	1935338	I guess that is a big game this week, but certainly for one particular genre.
1935458	1939040	For a role-play gamer fan like me, not as much.
1940320	1954644	Um, alright, anyhow, let's move on to some other gaming news, and speaking of roleplaying games, Dragon Quest IX is definitely highly anticipated, and of course it's so highly anticipated there are folks trying to get the game before it is actually out.
1955224	1959985	Uh, there's actually a leaked version of Dragon Quest IX that's showing up on some, uh,
1960505	1960625	D.S.
1960645	1960905	Owata
1980812	1981594	Thanks for watching!
1996836	2001200	I was reading about this whole story about the whole fake ROMs, and I thought this was very interesting.
2002561	2003801	We've heard this kind of thing before.
2004122	2008305	Haven't you heard about the musicians who put the fake music out there to stop the pirates?
2008805	2012168	I don't think it was Madonna's last album, but the one before it.
2012788	2020354	She put out these tracks on the internet that would play the first 30 seconds of the song, and then the rest of it would be her going, What the fuck do you think you're doing?
2021114	2021875	Did you hear about this?
2022676	2023596	This is a couple years ago.
2023616	2024817	It was really funny, actually.
2025117	2028500	But it would play the first few seconds of the song, and then, what the fuck do you think you're doing?
2029501	2034224	Which is essentially, this is like the game version of that, in a way.
2034584	2038487	Although, now, not to say that this was something that Square Enix did themselves.
2038628	2041870	It was probably some anti-piracy people just doing that.
2042170	2045673	But you have seen this kind of thing happen before, like the original EarthBound.
2046093	2046574	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2067130	2068151	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2084070	2084630	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2106058	2106599	I have no vitamin D
2128380	2129741	So, I don't know.
2130741	2131722	What do you think, Loki?
2131762	2134743	Do you think game companies might be doing this on purpose?
2134783	2137784	Do you think there's any chance at all Square Enix could be behind something like this?
2138084	2138845	Do you think they should be?
2139865	2140545	I think it's stupid.
2141026	2143027	You know, because it's not going to really stop anything.
2143087	2147428	Because, really, a lot of people will download it and then they'll post, Hey, by the way, this is not the game.
2147468	2148729	This is actually a hacked thing.
2149009	2151050	It's really going to affect just a small group of people.
2151270	2152691	And they found a fix for it.
2152771	2152991	So...
2154244	2155524	It really accomplished nothing.
2155825	2164827	And a lot of times there will be these... We've talked about them before, different anti-piracy stuff that they have, especially on DS games.
2166568	2175911	It tricks people for a while and it stops them from being able to play it, but then eventually they fix it and patch it and it's done.
2176551	2178892	So they found a way to unbrick all those DSs already?
2180192	2183293	I was looking up something because I was actually looking at...
2184525	2213495	I didn't really want to pirate the game because I don't really it's a full Japanese game and it's RPG it's just like I don't have time to play it for one and two it's all in Japanese I wouldn't know what the hell is going on so it's just not interesting but I was kind of curious to see if they did find a fix for that stuff and there was someone talking about ways to fix it and there was like apparently a way to fix it if you'd done something else I don't remember what it was but yeah apparently there are ways to fix it if you did you know brick it
2214454	2214814	Interesting.
2216595	2219856	And Frisbee in chat says, you can't just break someone's DS.
2220356	2222417	Well, that's what they're saying, that they break these things somehow.
2222837	2224977	I don't know how you do it, but it must do something.
2225477	2232360	It overwrote something that was on their actual firmware.
2232680	2234960	So it just kind of tweaked something.
2235401	2235821	Interesting.
2235921	2237481	Well, you know, I don't know.
2237541	2239462	I mean, is it what these pirates deserve?
2239682	2242923	Do you think it's what people deserve for being so overeager or careless?
2243123	2243383	ToplessMod
2262383	2262924	and DarkSakura.com.
2275521	2276302	I don't know.
2276562	2278424	I'm borderline interested in Dragon Quest IX.
2278444	2281347	If you've listened to the show before, you know I have this weird thing about handheld gaming.
2281367	2282408	It'll come out over here eventually.
2282448	2286131	I know it's going to come out over here, but I don't know if I really want it because of the fact it's on the DS.
2286171	2287673	And you know how I feel about handheld gaming.
2287953	2290455	But then again, I did play Final Fantasy IV.
2290615	2292858	I've played Final Fantasy II and I on PSP.
2293498	2297082	I'll probably get this, but I'm going to wait and see the reviews first.
2297642	2316456	I'm kind of actually glad it's out in Japan for a little while before it comes out here that way I kind of hear if it's good or not the one I really liked Dragon Quest VIII though on PlayStation 2 that was a pretty good RPG that's another one I need to go back and finish along with Final Fantasy XII but I have to go get my PlayStation 2 and hook it up because my 3 is not backwards compatible lame
2317012	2318033	Mine is... Yeah, whatever.
2334708	2336770	Final Fantasy IV is not like a kid's thing.
2336850	2338972	It's just old school graphics.
2339052	2339512	What was it?
2339612	2340593	The Mystic Quest.
2340693	2341974	It's what I remember as a kid.
2342034	2343435	Oh, hell no, it's not Mystic Quest.
2343915	2346718	It's like Final Fantasy IV hard type.
2347418	2353763	The original Japanese one where you get random battles way more often than you did in the American release and so forth.
2354184	2354684	So I'm a...
2357149	2386404	I'm probably going to finish Final Fantasy 4 the after years but for right now I wanted to go to something a little more new school and I remembered I really wanted to beat Lost Odyssey and for some weird reason I actually do kind of want to play Blue Dragon even though that wasn't nearly as good I just kind of want to finish that so who knows anyhow VXJasonXV in chat is frowning saying I liked Mystic Quest I beat Mystic Quest actually I did play that all the way through it was not like it was a very hard game to beat yeah it wasn't terrible it just wasn't Final Fantasy at all
2386784	2389267	It really wasn't originally a Final Fantasy game anyway.
2389287	2390549	No, it wasn't.
2390909	2394094	In fact, do you know in Japan that game was released as Final Fantasy USA?
2395035	2396637	Boy, didn't that make us look stupid.
2397150	2406375	But now, keep in mind, though, now whenever games released in America, they get re-released in Japan as international versions.
2406395	2409617	Because typically, especially with Square games, we start getting extra stuff.
2411358	2417000	Like, for example, Final Fantasy VII, if I'm right, it got a re-release.
2417421	2418341	X did, I know for sure.
2418361	2419622	Yeah, X did.
2419642	2421503	Because we got another weapon released.
2422065	2422465	Hey, Shermie
2451588	2452628	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2477173	2500716	A sheep skin, a sheep fur rug At least it's not a severed head But it's like right in the corner under the computer table So it's really in a dark little corner And Shermie has made this like her little bed I think it's very cute Yeah, it's definitely covered with Shermie hair Yeah But, well, when we had, it actually, part of it got ruined because of her to start with But I also spilled Kool-Aid on it
2501095	2505838	Sorry, I didn't mean to get away from video gaming with kitty talk, but yeah, let's move on with some more gaming news.
2505878	2509220	DarkSakura, if you want to go ahead and get into the next thing for us.
2509240	2516324	By the way, if you want to join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be live on this Sunday evening as we tape on All Games Radio.
2517444	2528551	Well, there was talk about Sony getting the Netflix service, and it's coming to the Bravia TV.
2529482	2531163	to the PlayStation Bravia.
2531423	2535164	To the Bravia internet capable TVs.
2535624	2540806	There's actually nothing mentioned about it coming to the PS3.
2541946	2544987	There's hints of it coming to the Wii, but nothing yet.
2545647	2546567	But yeah, they're...
2548809	2562099	Sony is actually saying right off the bat that they were going to look into content for the PlayStation Network, but they don't have anything regarding the Netflix to announce at this time.
2562860	2562980	So...
2564568	2565549	I don't think... Yeah, they probably just...
2585040	2591362	Sony might actually not want it on their platform because they have their service on there and they don't want it to compete with their service.
2591983	2593343	Because they're greedy little bastards.
2593423	2594604	It's not like Netflix.
2594864	2595664	I mean, let's be honest.
2595684	2599365	The Netflix streaming content still leaves a lot to be desired.
2599445	2604227	You are looking at the back catalog of movies that most people missed the first time.
2604547	2605768	They do have a few...
2606408	2609711	Decent movies on there now that they have the Stars play especially.
2610051	2616496	They do get some stuff that's recently to cable movies, but that's about as recent as you get with a lot of this stuff.
2616536	2618998	And now they have some of the Disney movies too, I will say, which is pretty cool.
2619398	2622040	But there's still a lot of room for improvement.
2622761	2626263	I will say the thing I like Netflix for best is the TV shows.
2626564	2634290	They do have a lot of the NBC shows and stuff on demand type stuff, and you can get that, but
2635273	2637555	You know, there's still a lot.
2637595	2640157	I guess Sony has the TV service too, though.
2640537	2641858	Maybe that's the competition.
2641918	2642279	I don't know.
2642339	2645461	But Xbox has their on-demand stuff too.
2645622	2646923	The separate program.
2647103	2649485	Maybe they just want people to buy their stupid HDTVs.
2651126	2656530	And the best thing about this, though, is it's certain HDTVs and you have to have it hooked up a certain way.
2657151	2661174	And it's just like a really small percentage of people actually going to be using this.
2663056	2663216	Hmm.
2663638	2669563	I don't know, it's neat I guess, but until it's actually supported on all their TVs, then...
2671399	2674121	Look at some chat comments from chat.orangelandreda.com.
2674141	2675903	Tigerclaw asks, here's the thing.
2675923	2678925	Are those Bravia TVs come equipped with built-in Wi-Fi?
2679686	2682708	I'm guessing they must if they have the Netflix service in them.
2683029	2685371	That's kind of the thing to do with a lot of appliances now.
2685411	2687933	Like tons of things are coming out with Wi-Fi enabled.
2688433	2692797	They have little radios now that are like internet radios basically that use Wi-Fi.
2692837	2693818	They hook right into Wi-Fi.
2694238	2696720	It's getting, I guess, so cheap, the technology.
2697481	2700862	that you're starting to see it in a lot of stuff.
2700902	2702942	It's pretty soon my toaster's going to have Wi-Fi.
2706183	2708704	DarkSakura's yelling from the kitchen, you can put Linux on a toaster.
2709144	2716046	You can, but also just have the toaster connected to Wi-Fi where it goes, ding, the toast is done.
2716066	2718867	Or maybe it would pop a message on all your computers, toast is done.
2719047	2720987	Why would you leave your toast to toast?
2722288	2723648	DarkSakura wants to make a comment on this.
2724178	2725239	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2744842	2750368	A lot of devices have Wi-Fi in them, so I would not be surprised at all if the TV has Wi-Fi somehow built in it.
2750909	2758417	Attack of the Clock goes on to say some Blu-ray players have built-in Wi-Fi but cost more as opposed to the ones built with LAN.
2759157	2764963	And that's true because to get your Blu-ray firmware updates, you have to be connected to the internet somehow, right?
2765624	2766465	Yeah.
2767586	2772872	Dark Charger in chat says, seems funny that even standalone Blu-ray players offer it from Samsung and LG.
2773293	2777617	I've heard about that too, the whole Blu-ray slash Netflix players.
2777718	2778358	I've heard about that.
2780260	2782823	Deathwishing is asking for less movie news, more gaming.
2783384	2783624	Well...
2784565	2795328	I guess you could tie this into gaming somehow because let's face it, those gaming consoles, the 360 and PlayStation 3, the movies are a big part of the business and kind of how they're getting into more and more homes, right?
2795348	2803330	Because maybe mom and dad and grandma aren't so interested in playing Tomb Raider on it, but they'd be more interested in downloading movies.
2803370	2804810	Watching Tomb Raider on it.
2806570	2807171	Possibly.
2807891	2808731	No, probably not.
2810080	2811861	What was the other comment we had in here?
2813382	2816203	If you want to add your comments, chat.orangelaundry.com.
2816663	2821104	DarkCharger also says, seems funny that even standalone Blu-ray players... Oh, I'm sorry.
2821124	2821925	I read that one already.
2821965	2822985	Where was the one?
2823385	2827987	Sorry, but DarkCharger said, my guess is Sony doesn't want it because it competes with their own service in their eyes.
2831828	2834409	Well, I guess we'll see what develops.
2834769	2838411	I think it's inevitable it'll get something streaming soon.
2839719	2846955	More along the Netflix model at some point, but maybe because Sony owns its own movie studio and wants to do something different.
2847096	2847396	We'll see.
2849676	2870310	Well, Harmonix basically thinks, and this is according to Josh Randall, their boss, he thinks that the music game genre could actually leave the consoles and actually go to more of their own standalone peripherals, basically the plug-and-play type game things.
2870770	2873652	And I know we've already kind of seen this with some things.
2873732	2875033	I know they're not very...
2876001	2876081	D.D.R.
2895983	2897084	It was the DDR brand.
2897384	2899024	It came with a mat, but it didn't do anything.
2899144	2901225	The mat didn't do a damn thing.
2901425	2907267	It was obviously made for three-year-olds, just for them to jump on the mat pretending they're actually doing something.
2907567	2910328	But it would just play these cheesy Flash music videos on the TV.
2910629	2913129	This is the kind of shit three- and four-year-olds love, though.
2913229	2917471	So I forgive them for that, even if they did slap the DDR label on it.
2917851	2919131	Jack's Pacific, G2 Game Girl, Hannah Montana,
2947057	2964747	Guitar Video Game, which you will play on Amazon, and I actually did watch this earlier this week just to see what the hell this was, because I knew it was crap, and I really had low expectations for it.
2965047	2969830	But you know what, hey, for the non-experienced...
2972614	2973675	A six-year-old.
2973715	2974776	For a six-year-old.
2974796	2975397	For a six-year-old.
2975417	2977879	That doesn't give a crap, you know.
2977899	2978219	Yeah.
2978259	2987147	For $30, you know, $33.27, you can get this guitar that plug and plays into your TV, and you can actually play with Hannah Montana songs, I guess.
2987768	2988068	I don't know.
2989790	3002869	but I mean until the technology becomes cheap enough to where they can really pack a lot of oomph inside of a little plastic controller I don't think this is really going to take off
3004252	3005232	Well, what if though?
3005272	3010995	Now, I'm sure this guy who made the comment has to be aware this type of thing has already been attempted.
3011475	3014416	But we've never seen anything on a large scale level.
3014796	3019278	This kind of ties in in a way to the fact that like Wi-Fi is in all of our devices now.
3019758	3022159	I mean, I don't think you would see something like this get released for $30.
3023260	3024080	But don't you think?
3024500	3025401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3047557	3052501	PlayStation 1 level hardware in one of these things really cheap.
3052681	3058765	Maybe even PlayStation 2 level hardware in one of these things really cheap where you can even go on and download songs.
3059265	3073876	I'm thinking this guy's talking about not so much this crap that they make for six-year-olds to easily amuse them for a while so you don't have to listen to them whine, but something that the more adult gamers can take seriously and more importantly, download songs onto.
3074276	3075757	That's going to be the big thing about these.
3076117	3076738	They probably...
3077538	3084520	If you bypass Xbox Live Marketplace, you bypass Sony's thing and Nintendo's thing, what is one big thing this is really about?
3085621	3086521	Cutting out the middleman.
3088102	3089562	Making more money from the download songs.
3089862	3091583	I don't think it'll take off.
3091663	3092543	I don't think it's going to work.
3092983	3097425	It's just because they are limited to what they can do with the hardware right now.
3098465	3100206	Honestly, I think if it could be done, it would be done.
3101755	3125813	because I mean obviously everyone wants to make money and they're always trying to come up with these knockoff games if anything I could see them doing something you know and I'm surprised Konami hasn't done this yet because they did this with you know some of their Frogger and Yu-Gi-Oh games where they have these things that you basically buy it's a USB thumb drive you plug it in your computer connects you to the internet and you play a game
3126246	3126846	I have one of those.
3127186	3127887	It's Frogger, yeah.
3127927	3131928	Yes, so you get something like this that's either DDR or something like that.
3131968	3135149	You plug the mat into your PC, boom, you're playing DDR.
3135449	3139450	Or you plug in the guitar into your PC and you're playing Guitar Freaks or Rock Revolution.
3139550	3142611	Hopefully not Rock Revolution, but actually Guitar Freaks.
3143491	3145932	They have tons of this stuff for the TV, too.
3146012	3146512	This is huge.
3146792	3150994	And actually, even some hardcore gamers like this stuff because you have a lot of those classic video games inside the joystick.
3151014	3152154	Yeah, the flashback systems are awesome.
3152254	3154675	The flashback systems are actually, you know,
3154986	3155326	Atari 2600s
3177901	3178241	Yeah.
3203228	3205290	I don't know, guys, in chat, would you guys be interested?
3205330	3209474	Let's say they could build something like this that would be at a PlayStation 2 level.
3209834	3214559	Let's say that you could basically get Rock Band on a PlayStation 2 without needing the PlayStation 2.
3214699	3216380	Or even, let's think, even beyond this.
3216420	3217321	Would you be interested in this?
3217842	3225048	Like, through, like, say, a cable provider, like Comcast or something like that, you're, you know, plugging your controller into the actual...
3225831	3226431	Thanks for watching!
3242679	3243199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3265313	3266514	Saga Channel Saga Channel Saga Channel
3294664	3299047	I'm kind of surprised that cable has not tried to get back into this.
3299547	3301008	Especially with Comcast.
3301288	3303469	Especially, you know, I know them because they're the local provider here.
3303789	3309072	Getting into DVR and movies on demand and telephones now.
3310453	3310653	Yeah.
3312414	3314395	And Jason says, totally not worth the investment.
3314715	3317016	I remember liking the thing as a kid.
3318517	3318857	I don't know.
3321379	3322679	Jason says there's no other way to do it.
3322779	3323400	Not yet anyway.
3324088	3324568	I don't know.
3324728	3337195	It's just... I understand you can buy these peripherals and stuff now, and they are expensive, but at least you can use them for a few games and get some use out of them.
3338716	3339076	I don't know.
3339176	3341878	And the flashback systems are good for what they are.
3341898	3346460	I mean, it's some old... It's hard to win 600 games.
3347020	3349582	You can hack them, though, so you can actually plug in your own cartridges.
3349622	3350282	Cheap thrills.
3350382	3350983	That's what they are.
3351043	3351383	Cheap thrills.
3351423	3351623	Exactly.
3353063	3354363	It's what you give your kids to play.
3355404	3359444	All right, well, we'll see what happens with the music games in the future.
3360445	3361265	I think it'll happen.
3361765	3362465	I think it'll happen.
3362525	3363766	I think it'll happen by Christmas.
3364966	3365806	Maybe not this year.
3365886	3373988	They better hurry up and do it, though, before the music... Because, you know, Guitar Hero is forcing the music game series to jump the shark.
3374348	3376128	So it'll be interesting to see what happens.
3379122	3384205	Rumor is going around the internet this week that possibly we have a Kane and Lynch fiasco part 2.
3384566	3385106	Remember this?
3385586	3387508	This is a whole fiasco.
3387748	3388088	Is it part 3?
3388128	3389209	They did Tomb Raider.
3390149	3391690	The last Tomb Raider game they did the same thing.
3391710	3393472	Well look, let's catch people up if you forgot.
3393492	3403598	There was this whole fiasco with GameSpot where it was rumored, it was never really proved one way or the other, that Eidos was buying off GameSpot to give Kane and Lynch essentially decent reviews.
3404059	3407201	And I remember it kind of resulted, wasn't that the reason why some people...
3407921	3408761	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3425626	3426386	I think was what happened.
3446952	3447473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3468996	3472618	And these are basically, this isn't the first time this has happened.
3472959	3488909	Back in November 2008, Eidos basically was putting the same type of pressure on publishers saying that if you're planning on reviewing Tomb Raider Underworld at less than an 8.0, Eidos will need you to hold your review until Monday.
3489950	3493893	But if you're going to put it out now, you can put it out at a higher review.
3493973	3498276	But it was like, seriously, you're going to attempt to do that?
3499716	3504024	In their defense, I understand why they're doing that because obviously they want the positive buzz going into it.
3504204	3508311	Not that I'm going to say Batman Arkham Asylum is going to be a horrible game because it's not.
3508351	3508952	It looks good.
3509493	3509714	But...
3510959	3511839	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3535726	3543952	But I just want to clarify now, now that we've kind of said that, I do want to state this because this is important, is that Kotaku ran an update to their version of the story.
3544373	3554441	Eidos apparently contacted them, extremely denying the story, saying, quote, With regards, an article posted on Ram Raider, which was the original site, which, by the way, Ram Raider?
3554741	3562347	I mean, I understand what they're, like, the, you know, RAM that you have in a computer, but I don't want to, I don't want to make enemies, but Ram Raider?
3562427	3562687	Really?
3562707	3562827	Really?
3563988	3565709	That's just begging to be made fun of.
3565749	3566130	I'm sorry.
3566150	3567090	That's just a blog.
3567150	3570133	It's literally like a blog run at blogspot.com.
3570193	3571434	Sounds like the name of the bad porn.
3571654	3572174	I know, I know.
3572254	3572935	But anyway, sorry.
3573816	3575557	I hope nobody from that site listens to the show.
3575577	3578960	I don't mean to make fun, but look at all the attention and extra views you're getting this week.
3579460	3591443	Anyway, Eidos said, With regards to the article posted on Ram Raider alleging that Eidos has fixed review scores for Batman Arkham Asylum, we want to state that no discussions have been held about review scores with any magazines.
3592003	3596945	In short, there is simply not one shred of truth in this article except for the title of the game.
3597005	3599985	And that is from John Brook, the head of UK marketing for Eidos.
3600325	3602466	So they deny it, saying this is not true.
3603206	3605987	And to be fair to them...
3606787	3616870	What a good lie that would be to say that any magazine that puts it on the cover and has a review score of 90% or above is kind of breaking the rules a little bit.
3617190	3618410	But it'll be interesting to see.
3619030	3625812	I think one way you could prove this story true is what sites have their reviews up by a certain day?
3625972	3627233	Are they all good news?
3627293	3627753	You know what I mean?
3628473	3641071	and also if they're coming out and saying oh this is the exclusive review of this I hate exclusive reviews of anything because that's retarded this is my exclusive impression of this game
3642116	3642817	Yes, it is.
3642837	3643897	Your early review.
3644157	3645879	That's what it is, your early review.
3645919	3651883	No, no, what's going to happen is it's going to leak out because it's Eidos and because it's a game that they're probably going to ship early.
3652403	3656566	So it's going to leak out to the internet and everyone will know if it's crap or not and it will be already out there.
3657067	3662791	And they're going to have a bunch of independent blog sites and stuff giving their reviews, breaking all the other embargoes.
3662851	3664392	So it doesn't matter.
3664432	3666833	You're not going to get what you want anyway, so too bad.
3667974	3668955	This is how things work.
3670697	3677867	Which is a darn shame because if Batman is a good game, even this rumor sadly puts a little blemish on it.
3678348	3681392	And to be honest, not one that's actually that important.
3681713	3686199	I mean, even amongst all the hardcore gamers, the people that listen to these shows and read the blogs...
3686900	3690002	I think the audience for Batman Arkham Asylum is way bigger.
3690342	3700048	You know, when you consider there's lots of Batman fans out there, the people that saw The Dark Knight, which was, you know, just a huge grossing movie and everything, I think there's a big casual gaming audience for this.
3700068	3707913	And by casual gaming, I mean the college kids who think video games are cool but don't obsess about them like the rest of us do, if that makes sense.
3708793	3710074	I don't think they give a shit about the ratings.
3710094	3711175	I think it's going to be a big game.
3711595	3712355	I think it will be, too.
3712476	3715838	You know, coming out in August, there's really only Madden, this...
3716798	3719341	Wolfenstein, and maybe Section 8.
3719381	3722404	Those are the big games for August.
3724126	3727049	I think this is probably going to be better than Wolfenstein.
3728951	3732374	I'd say it's at least the second top two of the month.
3733177	3737898	Some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelonsradio.com live on this Sunday evening, July the 12th.
3737958	3741139	DarkCharger says, let's not forget that it could also go the other way around.
3741459	3742780	Hey, we'll give you a good review.
3742860	3744400	Can we please break this embargo?
3744860	3745801	Interesting perspective.
3745921	3755083	Could it be that sometimes the offering party is not the game company, but the over-eager site that wants to get the first jump on the review?
3755103	3760185	All it's about is hits and subscriptions is really what it comes down to because...
3761468	3769331	If they have the review early, then everybody picks up, oh hey, such and such site or magazine has a review early.
3769711	3770692	They put a link to it.
3770772	3774873	Everybody goes and visits it or looks at the magazine to see what the impressions are on it.
3777316	3777716	That's it.
3778096	3783757	And then if it's the other way around, hey, we'll give you a good review if you let us break the embargo.
3784297	3794740	I have a problem with that anyways because, once again, there are certain websites, IGN, that like to have exclusive reviews about games and stuff like that just to get more page hits.
3795220	3798160	And that's all they really care about is just hits to their site.
3798660	3802201	And I'm sure that they make a lot of negotiations with these people.
3802241	3806502	Hell, we've seen it firsthand, negotiations about breaking embargoes and stuff.
3807964	3813567	It's just a tool to make these sites feel special and to get more hits.
3814928	3820530	Bobby in chat says, True story, I was doing a review of a certain game series and was allowed to somewhat break the embargo.
3820891	3825973	The embargo was midnight on Monday morning and my show is on Sunday night if I like the game.
3826253	3828414	But they wouldn't let me break the embargo if I didn't like it.
3830355	3834297	I'm telling you guys, I've been saying it for seven goddamn years.
3834858	3837499	Independent is the only people you can trust.
3839517	3839957	Believe it.
3841398	3843100	Believe it.
3866004	3867085	I mean, I don't know.
3868085	3869406	Honestly, I don't care enough.
3869926	3872007	Because Eidos isn't doing anything for me.
3872427	3873928	They aren't giving me anything for free.
3874308	3875929	They aren't treating me special.
3876149	3877469	What do I care?
3877709	3878930	I don't care either way.
3879070	3880931	So, big deal.
3880951	3883752	If their game sucks, their game sucks.
3884072	3887314	If it's good, good for them because they haven't had a lot of games that didn't suck.
3887394	3889015	So, yeah.
3889995	3891195	Mini Ninjas looks good though.
3891856	3892596	I'll give them that.
3893116	3894437	But, uh, yeah.
3894870	3896271	Alright, well, we'll move on.
3896331	3900773	In the meantime, we'll continue to be as honest as possible in our reviews of games.
3901313	3902873	So we have something called integrity.
3903314	3903514	Yes.
3903834	3905094	So anyway, let's move on.
3905134	3907135	We got some more gaming news to talk about tonight.
3907155	3910076	Release date's coming up, as well as a quick break before too long.
3911277	3916159	Well, we are seeing something that's a little kind of old, coming out in an old way.
3917339	3917920	But it's new.
3919040	3919600	But it's old.
3919861	3921421	It's old, but it's new, but it's old.
3921481	3921721	Okay.
3922922	3923062	It's
3924525	3927987	A new item done in an old way of an old franchise.
3928007	3929247	Tell us what the hell it is already.
3929948	3930528	Mega Man!
3931608	3932049	Cool.
3932589	3935490	We have the Mega Man demo released for the Atari 2600.
3936030	3936290	What?
3937291	3938592	Yeah.
3938772	3948116	It was done for the IM 8-bit show, and it's actually on Atari's Atari Ages forum now, so you can go download and play it on your emulator.
3948908	3952274	And by the way, if you want to hear some of the sweet Atari 2600 music, here you go.
3952614	3954097	See if you recognize what stage this is.
3962665	3963906	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3984693	3989218	with the same little mini monsters, the little dudes that are on the ground crawling back and forth.
3989918	3992521	But still, I mean, neat concept, right?
3992881	3994183	Yeah, but they're moving right.
3995191	3997491	and then horrible Flickr when the guy gets to Elect Man.
3997511	4000192	But hey, you know, there's only so much you can do with the hardware.
4000232	4001992	There's some games you can make Flickr work for you.
4002232	4002852	I guess that's true.
4003192	4006673	But, yeah, you know, it's interesting, it's neat.
4007553	4014814	And I think it's more of a novel thing from, oh, that's, you know, oh, it's Atari 2200, ooh.
4015495	4016395	You know, that kind of thing.
4016795	4019915	But this does beg the question, why?
4020775	4021596	Because it can.
4022476	4023516	It's a labor of love.
4024443	4027489	I guess that's the only way you can justify it because, I mean, really?
4027890	4036467	It's something that you'll download and you'll play for five minutes and you'll go, oh, that's kind of cool and tell your friend, oh, ha ha ha, look at this and then you're done.
4036752	4041054	But the sad thing is it probably took the guy five days to put it all together, you know?
4041414	4042815	Or even longer, maybe.
4043015	4044156	Maybe, maybe.
4044296	4047337	You can make a whole Metroid game in a day with a Metroid level editor.
4047638	4053381	And, you know, with the Atari games, you just have to know your basic programming and they're done.
4053401	4056162	You could probably do that in a day.
4056262	4062965	Jason in our chatroom, VXJasonXV, says, They do what they want, or I'm sorry, they do what they must because they can.
4064386	4064666	Get it?
4065447	4065807	Forget it.
4066545	4067425	I know, I get it.
4067625	4071267	And honestly, actually, I think that's about the most accurate way to describe it.
4071427	4071887	He can do it?
4072528	4073208	Fine, do it.
4073288	4074508	Free country, your server space.
4075309	4078850	Alright, well we're going to do what we must because we can right now with some release dates.
4079010	4080751	Loki, take it away with the US releases.
4081351	4083232	Not much coming out this week, unfortunately.
4084753	4087013	Got a couple Greatest Hits games.
4087033	4090295	Transformers on the PSP is now Greatest Hits.
4090415	4091875	I'm surprised it took this long.
4092596	4095537	Call of Duty Road to Victory is now Greatest Hits as well.
4096121	4098403	Both of those can be found for $20 on the PSP.
4099364	4102726	Brand new stuff, Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the Mummy on the DS.
4103987	4109691	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PSP.
4110112	4114535	NCAA Football 2010 is your big game for the week.
4115616	4122041	Ripping off on the Cookie Mama franchise, Science Papa coming out on the Wii and DS this week.
4122221	4123162	Is that from the same company?
4123553	4127156	No, it's from Activision.
4128277	4131380	Tony Hawk Project 8, also hitting greatest hits on PSP.
4131420	4135123	A lot of PSP greatest hits this week.
4137525	4140587	Also, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, also greatest hits on PSP.
4141741	4144182	and then the last game this week, Birthday Party Bash.
4144402	4148664	It's basically a birthday party in a box with coloring sheets and fun stuff like that.
4149784	4155727	It's a generic party game and that's available on the Wii from Take-Two.
4157728	4158208	That's it.
4158788	4159688	It's a slow week.
4159808	4167892	Oh, and a whole ton of controller skins for all your favorite college football teams available on Xbox 360 and PS3.
4170490	4173992	Alright, well, moving on to Japanese release dates.
4174112	4177413	Nothing on Xbox 360 this week, but there is a game on PlayStation 3.
4177693	4182776	Professional Baseball Spirits Version 6 is out this week from Konami in Japan.
4182816	4185937	And this is like a very realistic type of baseball game.
4185957	4188118	Because you know baseball is pretty popular over in Japan.
4188558	4189999	And a very realistic looking game.
4190659	4194541	It's a pretty cool looking baseball game with all the Japanese teams and such, I'm sure.
4194901	4196681	I don't know if it's an officially licensed thing or what.
4197021	4198362	I'm not that familiar with this series.
4198422	4201542	But the graphics look pretty good from the screenshots I can see.
4201862	4204503	That's really the only big release on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4205063	4213204	Going to the Nintendo Wii, the only game that's out on there is Nihon Yakyukiku Shounen Batting Revolution.
4213364	4215045	Yes, that's right, another baseball game.
4215125	4218685	But this one's on the Wii, and it is not the same type of game.
4218745	4220026	It's not from Konami either.
4220066	4221926	It's from a company called Alpha Unit.
4222546	4223066	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4249175	4268580	Awatama is another game out this week on the Nintendo DS and quickly going to the PSP there really isn't a whole lot out unless you are a fan of Ys Ys 1 and 2 Chronicles is the big game this week on the PSP so check that out I have that on the PC Engine
4268991	4271192	That's really it as far as release dates go this week.
4271232	4280095	By the way though, I do want to quickly say one thing I noticed that's being marketed here on this site where I get the Japanese release dates from, this new Korean thing called the Wiz.
4280136	4281116	Have you heard of this, Loki?
4281596	4287398	It's like a little handheld device that looks like I guess you could say like a Game Boy Advance is what it looks like.
4287699	4297963	But what it is, it's actually a little mini computer that is like it's 533 megahertz with a 3D accelerator open source platform Linux operating system on it.
4298043	4298723	And it's this tiny
4298803	4301304	Yeah, they've got a few of those.
4301864	4307505	Hell, they were showing off some of those at like the last, not last E3, but the last E3 went before that.
4307845	4312247	Maybe this has been out a while and I'm just now noticing it because it's on sale or something, but it just looks neat.
4312267	4313267	It does video and everything.
4313367	4314467	Yeah, they're out there.
4314487	4316348	There's a lot of open source platforms.
4316368	4319809	I think the other one was like GPX2 or something like that.
4319829	4320809	I don't remember what it was called.
4320909	4321089	Huh.
4321269	4322410	on the 17th Planet Commando for PC.
4339338	4340179	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4368334	4372875	There are two big games coming out this fall from Activision and EA.
4373635	4378556	Tar Hero 5 and The Beatles Rock Band.
4378836	4385698	Those games are definitely going to be very hot sellers on all platforms.
4385818	4390279	The thing is, this is also kind of a test for Activision and EA.
4390339	4391519	This is the first game...
4392459	4393300	Thanks for watching!
4415307	4418209	I have a feeling this may be a start of another new trend.
4418689	4421951	I don't know if you remember with Xbox Live Arcade and stuff like that.
4423672	4428075	Top price at one point was $10 or 800 Microsoft points.
4428595	4433898	Then there was one game out there that decided, hey, you know what, let's try to charge $1,200 Microsoft points.
4433918	4436380	Wasn't Luminous the first one that went to $15?
4436660	4441463	Is Luminous or maybe... I'm not sure what the other one might have been.
4441843	4442323	Thanks for watching!
4461741	4483899	I have a feeling that the trend now with the Wii where $49.99 seemed to be the kind of the cap because I mean after all a lot of the Wii games that are out there were being developed at the same time on the PlayStation 2 and really there is a limitation what they can do with the hardware but I guess they're thinking now that the features are close enough to each other that now it warrants a higher price point.
4485373	4494425	I don't know if everybody's noticed that it's a higher price point and how many people actually game on the Wii with Guitar Hero and stuff but that's kind of a disturbing trend.
4496929	4498009	Interesting comments in chat.
4498209	4500390	Alphacatanagram asks, was it the Penny Arcade game?
4500430	4501650	Now that was the first $20 game.
4501710	4503090	I know that was the first $20 game.
4503891	4508692	Then DarkCharger says, I checked out Major Nelson's site and lots of users are unhappy about the $1,200 price point.
4509092	4511452	Well, you know, you have to kind of look at both sides of it.
4512033	4514093	Of course people are going to be pissed they have to pay more.
4514433	4516194	But you have to kind of wonder, is it justified?
4516554	4517054	You know what?
4517114	4523395	For an in-depth game like the Penny Arcade game and Luminous and even the, well, Luminous nickel and dimed us to death a little bit.
4523475	4524115	But I'll say more.
4524476	4526116	The Penny Arcade game, Braid,
4527596	4529997	A lot of these games are worth $10 to $15.
4530077	4530497	You know what?
4530537	4542620	You may not think so, but in my mind, the stuff that really was for $5 was the remakes of 80s video games where they didn't really do much to it.
4542940	4551622	I'm talking about the Pac-Mans, the Gyruses, the Froggers, those old school games where they didn't really do that much to it but re-skin it.
4551782	4552182	That was $5.
4553462	4558651	A lot of this other stuff that they're building from the ground up, you know what, face it, a lot of it's worth $10 if not more.
4559012	4560013	But here's my problem though.
4560214	4562217	My problem is that these games...
4563157	4565419	Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5
4584816	4587897	The only difference is you'll probably get download content with the Wii version.
4588517	4592598	Which is fine, because right now I don't think World Tour has download content on the Wii.
4592838	4593739	Maybe they do, I don't remember.
4594159	4594839	But I don't think they do.
4594859	4596679	I think Rock Band 2 is the only one that does it right now.
4598560	4601001	Okay, so maybe they feel that they're more justified for that.
4601101	4607482	But at the same time, you're kind of ripping off the consumer who's going to go and purchase more tracks online for more money.
4607802	4609403	Making you more money in the long run.
4609523	4609683	But...
4610891	4616496	There's no way that these two games, like on the 360 and PS3, are going to play exactly the same as the Wii version.
4616516	4620119	I mean, graphically, it's impossible that they're going to look the same.
4620139	4625424	I know that's not that important for a guitar hero game, but who cares?
4625524	4626345	There is a difference.
4626665	4628287	And I think that the fact that
4628787	4630028	All the Wii games out there have been $49.99.
4631348	4632149	Why should this change?
4632189	4636170	I mean, Guitar Hero Metallica and stuff, the last few Guitar Hero games have been the same price.
4637291	4638151	Why change it now?
4638351	4639592	And same with Beatles Rock Band.
4639912	4640432	What's the point?
4640492	4645294	I mean, I know Beatles, it's going to be a more, I guess, developed game.
4645655	4647095	It's a whole different style to it.
4647155	4650637	And yeah, I'm sure that the graphics aren't going to suffer too much on the Wii.
4651477	4667417	but still though, I think it's a rip off and I think we're going to start seeing more games where it's like oh but look at all these extra features that we added in, but you know what, you would have added those features anyways if you charged a $50 game and maybe you should, because a lot of these Wii games out there aren't just I can't justify the price point
4668258	4669360	I gotta be honest, I don't blame them.
4669740	4676890	I mean, on one level, it's the same damn game that you get on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, so why shouldn't they be paying the same price?
4677271	4684280	Granted, I know the Wii is a more limiting system, but at the same time, I mean, that's Nintendo's fault, not the developer.
4685161	4704968	Um, okay, so World Tour on the Wii does have download content, according to Actdeft, um, so, then that, then really, if they've done the same stuff on World Tour already, and Rock Band 2, if they both have download content, they're not really developing a new engine, I don't think, for these games, other than the art style, so, I don't see where the cost is coming into play.
4705868	4709969	The cost isn't... I don't think... It's not an extra cost, Loki.
4710269	4711209	It's the same cost.
4711889	4714210	It's the same price point that they have on the other systems.
4715050	4716931	I mean, I know it sucks.
4717171	4721572	$60 for a game is very expensive, but it's not like you're... You and I aren't going to buy this game on the Wii anyway.
4721992	4724852	We're going to be spending the extra $10 to get it on one of the better systems.
4725993	4730634	When I say better, I mean with the better graphics and things that are tailored a little more to these games.
4731054	4731234	But...
4732475	4734476	In a way, I don't really fault the developer for it.
4734557	4738240	They're charging the same price for the same game that they have on these other systems.
4738681	4741964	If it can't technically pull off the same thing, that's Nintendo's fault.
4744810	4745290	You know, fine.
4745410	4751095	If people don't have a problem with this now, then don't balk at it when more of your favorite games come out at a $60 price point.
4751275	4756639	Wait until Nintendo figures this out that they can charge $60 for your next Mario game or your Metroid game and stuff like that.
4757039	4757579	And you know what?
4757660	4760982	People aren't going to balk at it, then why shouldn't they charge those prices?
4761122	4762123	Let them shoot themselves in the foot.
4763151	4765372	But I want to go back to the thing about the Xbox.
4765752	4769113	If the games really aren't worth $60, they're not going to sell.
4769794	4771074	There's going to be a backlash.
4771174	4772895	Wait and see.
4772955	4775236	I would think twice about putting down $60 for some of the crap Nintendo puts out.
4775256	4781578	I think this is almost like the same thing that GameStop does with their Wii accessories, where they charge $5 over retail for them.
4781919	4785020	Because most consumers on the Wii don't know any better.
4785360	4786741	And that's what it's going to come down to.
4787281	4789122	Oh, well, this Guitar Hero is $60 this time.
4790382	4793286	Oh well, I'll just pay $60, and that's what it's going to come down to.
4793366	4799253	But if no one's really putting up a fuss about it, then yeah, people are going to start having to pay more.
4799513	4805560	I don't really care, because like I said, I don't play these games on the Wii, so they can do whatever they want, but...
4806758	4808359	I'm just looking out for everybody else.
4809120	4817827	I want to go back though and say quickly about the Xbox Live thing because there's a lot of people that think all the games should be $5 or that all the games should be no more than $10.
4818508	4833540	Well, look, how can you say that the games should all be $10 and then you turn around and plunk down $10.25, $10.50 even, $11 in some cities to go see a movie that might stink and it's only 90 minutes long to maybe two and a half hours.
4833660	4834101	You know what I mean?
4834861	4838283	I, I, honestly, I think a $15 price point for a lot of games is justified.
4838683	4839263	Not all of them.
4839523	4842364	Some of them are real stinkers and don't have a thrill that lasts very long.
4842724	4846826	But I think $15, hell, even $20 for some of the games is actually kind of justified.
4846986	4847487	And you know what?
4848047	4850488	What's good about Xbox Live and even the PlayStation Network?
4850588	4851168	There's demos.
4851408	4852469	You can check them out first.
4852869	4857451	You know, whereas like a movie, you can't, I mean, I guess the trailer is sort of the demo for the movie, but...
4858955	4860657	You can't really check out Wii games.
4861018	4868046	I mean, granted, you can probably get a good idea of what Guitar Hero 5 is going to be like and Beals Rock Band, but there are no demos on the Wii.
4869208	4869408	None.
4869809	4870830	Unless you go to a kiosk.
4871414	4877095	which is too bad because I would actually probably buy more Wii things if I could demo them first.
4877795	4882136	I've bought, I think, four games on the Wii, WiiWare.
4882496	4885797	I bought that Bit.Trip Beat, and I need to get the new one.
4886437	4895239	I bought Defend Your Castle, but that was only like a day one WiiWare, I want to see what a WiiWare game looks like type of thing, which, you know, wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great either.
4896299	4898800	I bought the Gradius Reimagining, which was pretty cool.
4900000	4900200	And...
4901445	4901885	Thanks for watching!
4925683	4928864	Joshi16 in chat says, the demo saved me $15 on Battlefield 1943.
4928964	4931325	It isn't bad, just not for me.
4931505	4936247	And I think, you know, again, I think we talked about, you know, Battlefield 1943 definitely appeals to fans of a certain genre.
4936327	4948611	And to be fair, you know, with the Wii and music games are involved, they've actually been charging the same price points for bundles, like their, you know, instrument bundles and stuff like that.
4950305	4951145	I guess that's fine.
4972335	4975517	Bringing this up to everybody so that you notice because you might not have.
4975917	4978719	And, you know, it is a big deal and you should let them know if you don't like it.
4979519	4982241	All right, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
4982341	4986243	And it's kind of one of those things where I really just want to let this guy rest in peace already.
4986323	4988164	But I think we have to bring it up.
4988244	4990065	And it's a story about Michael Jackson.
4990766	4996469	Apparently, what's going on right now, the MJJ Production Company, this is the...
4998170	4999750	Michael Jackson's production company
5018298	5040425	at MJJ Productions for several months and supposedly it's going to be out this holiday season so that's before he obviously died they were already working on this game they have not said what the game is no information about the developer what the heck it's about some people are wondering but they did say Michael Jackson loved games did you see the pictures of his arcade?
5040525	5046427	dude I wanted to buy the Beatmania machine they were only asking like a thousand dollars for it I want the pinball tables
5046775	5052457	Yeah, I know, but unfortunately now that he passed away, all that stuff's going to triple in value, so there's no way I can have it now.
5052837	5056658	But if he had still been alive, I was so going to get that Beatmania machine.
5057719	5060039	How awesome would that be to own something that Michael Jackson once had?
5060179	5061940	I was saving the money to get that Beatmania machine.
5061960	5062540	I'm not even kidding.
5063180	5063681	I looked at it.
5064941	5066401	Were you what I've been bidding against you?
5066601	5067042	Probably.
5068382	5069422	Didn't he have a DDR machine?
5069462	5070563	I think he had a DDR machine.
5070603	5071043	I think he did.
5071613	5072453	I would have totally bought that.
5072553	5076454	So anyway, but regardless, unfortunately now, none of us are going to be able to afford that.
5076574	5077834	I don't want any of his arcade games.
5077854	5079215	I don't have room for arcade games.
5080055	5080775	See, I do.
5080795	5082255	I still want a DDR machine, though.
5082295	5083195	I have that garage.
5083255	5089517	I could totally... Wouldn't you love, in the OLR studio, at the old one anyway, a Beat Media machine sitting in the corner?
5090017	5091417	They're not really all that hard to find.
5091797	5092517	You just have to know where to look.
5092537	5094198	I want the one that Michael Jackson had.
5094378	5095758	That's got a story behind it.
5097058	5098838	Alright, we'll forget it.
5099719	5101039	Anyhow, here's the thing.
5102154	5114643	One possible idea is that maybe this isn't a new game, but it could be like Moonwalker on Xbox Live Arcade, which considering the flurry of Genesis revivals we've seen is certainly a possibility.
5115584	5121729	Who knows, maybe even Space Channel 5, because Michael Jackson did play a role in Part 2, but somehow they didn't.
5122149	5124931	I think if anything it would be like... He had a major role in 2, though.
5125031	5125492	That's true.
5125672	5130936	I think it would be like a music game that had to tie in with his new comeback tour that he was going to do.
5131616	5132057	or something.
5132397	5134020	You know, Frisbee has an interesting comment in chat.
5134040	5135582	What about SingStar Michael Jackson?
5136143	5137305	That's not a bad thought.
5137986	5138627	Especially now.
5138647	5139208	That would be cool.
5139348	5142914	I would love to see a Michael Jackson rock band game.
5143837	5145118	would be so awesome.
5146059	5149581	I think it's inevitable you're going to see something maybe next year.
5150542	5152423	Maybe that'll be the next rock band game.
5152804	5154965	That would actually be pretty sweet, I've got to say.
5154985	5155586	That would be awesome.
5155846	5156546	But I don't know.
5157987	5161070	Does a lot of his music cater to the rock band series of instruments?
5161210	5161930	It doesn't matter.
5162190	5164592	I mean, they played instruments, okay?
5164612	5165853	They had guitars and drums.
5165993	5166393	We had Slash.
5166413	5167494	Therefore, it will work.
5167674	5168355	I guess that's true.
5168375	5170597	I guess it could happen, but I mean...
5172065	5183728	If you want to talk about, since they went all out for the Beatles with the whole re-skinning and re-imagining of the game's interface, I think Michael Jackson is at that same level.
5183768	5184728	Right up there with ABBA.
5187689	5190510	Okay, in all seriousness, Michael Jackson is definitely at that level.
5190590	5191490	If you change your mind.
5191877	5192057	What?
5192317	5192637	Nothing.
5193137	5193657	Or Journey.
5194778	5195518	I'm the first in line?
5195618	5195858	Yes.
5196518	5197278	Honey, I'm still free.
5197598	5198298	Yes, or Journey.
5198338	5199178	Take a chance on Michael.
5199378	5200258	But let's face it.
5201159	5207640	Despite my personal taste, Michael Jackson is universally at that level where I could see them doing a whole game about him.
5207820	5208120	Who knows?
5209740	5213861	Marissa Cungusto in chat confirms there are guitar parts on 70% of his songs, believe it or not.
5214261	5215021	I guess that makes sense.
5215261	5216161	You know, I just made it.
5216201	5217882	Was that a guitar her world tour?
5218402	5218942	Was it really?
5219002	5219242	Yeah.
5219542	5220042	Interesting.
5221786	5223848	God, I hope it's not a Guitar Hero game.
5225569	5227030	Isn't that sad that I say that?
5227190	5228211	I hope it's not Guitar Hero.
5228592	5229392	I hope it's Rock Band.
5229893	5235157	But just looking at the Beatles versus Van Halen, you can just tell which one had more effort put into it.
5235177	5235577	I'm sorry.
5237119	5240842	Sorry, developers of Van Halen who spent time on it, but you just didn't spend enough time.
5241923	5242183	All right.
5242935	5245076	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5270819	5281107	The classic game of the week is Seiken Densetsu 3 and it is the sequel to what we got as Secret of Mana.
5284149	5284890	Let's hear a little clip.
5292253	5294296	Right now our adventures are in a little cave.
5294636	5299984	Yeah, sadly all of the music that I found was either tantra music or boss battle stuff.
5300124	5301746	But I found this leading up to a boss battle.
5301826	5303368	The other one I think was a boss battle.
5303408	5304350	Um... I'll play that one.
5304630	5305071	Okay.
5306713	5310174	But this one is actually very unique.
5310634	5312375	You have a bunch of different classes.
5312415	5313935	You have six characters.
5314015	5315436	Each of them have their own stories.
5316036	5320817	And you play them in a combination.
5321297	5326799	So basically the way that you start, it's got the same type of real-time combat.
5326819	5329380	You've got the same ring menu as Secret of Mana.
5330240	5332901	But it's just different.
5332981	5342223	You've got, of course, your magic attributes on each character that sort of changes exactly how well they can use certain things.
5342763	5349605	You also can change your class by going light or dark, and then light-light, light-dark, dark-light, and dark-dark.
5350545	5378677	and you'd use a you'd change up the first one at level 18 with a mana stone or the next one is 38 with a special item so it's sort of different also with most of your enemies you can actually run away from them you can disengage your fight but your boss battles you pretty much end up locked in to your boss battles so you've got all that
5380138	5388966	Um... You can, um... When you defeat all the enemies on screen, you can actually get a treasure chest, and it has a prize in it.
5389887	5390607	So that's cool.
5391768	5391849	Um...
5394257	5421153	but the difference that instead of setting their range and aggression you actually set how they actually fight in battle like whether or not they want to do support or area effect or an individual target or if you're going to use your full power gauge or if you're going to use your full magic gauge or if they're going to use magic if you control how they cast their magic
5422013	5428936	Um, but you've got your, um, as far as the leveling up, you've also got your, you know, like I said, the class system.
5429416	5435058	You can change to a light class or a dark class, and you've got different abilities based on each of those.
5436098	5446923	Um, you also have a different day of the week, um, where an elemental spirit is in charge of that day, and based on that day, that type of magic will be stronger.
5446983	5447563	Like, you have...
5448363	5462855	Luna Day for Moon, Salamander Day for Fire, Undine Day for Water, Dryad Day for Wood, Djinn Day for Wind, Gnome Day for Earth, and Mana Holy Day where all of your magic is balanced.
5463736	5470140	So, um, you'd have, of course, a different elemental showing on your screen to indicate what day it is.
5471181	5476624	Um, with this one, you play as, um, different characters.
5477084	5488451	Um, they've actually been, um, there is a very fantastic fan translation, um, in English that actually even has all the in-game sprites translated into English.
5488732	5491193	So, um, it is a 100% translation.
5492794	5494355	I remember when that first came out.
5494375	5496596	That was a big fucking deal when that thing first came out.
5496716	5497016	Oh yeah.
5497216	5497457	Oh yeah.
5497477	5498357	It was a big, big deal.
5498397	5510083	But your characters in this are... You have Angela, who is a princess with magic power.
5511164	5513345	You have Duran, who is a swordsman.
5513385	5515486	You have Hawkeye, who is a thief.
5519769	5521290	Bryce, who is...
5523912	5529835	from the Wind Kingdom, Kevin, you have Charlotte, the Dark Prince.
5530415	5532236	You've got all these different characters.
5533017	5537299	But when you start off with your six, you start off with a main character and then choose two to partner with them.
5537959	5541181	So you are playing through different, you know, the story.
5541221	5547224	You can play through it a different time each time based on who your main person is and then who's having an out with them.
5548087	5550610	So it's pretty neat.
5553113	5559620	It really is, especially with that translation, it really is fantastic.
5559881	5562343	I mean, it is seriously the best play.
5564125	5565387	For anyone who...
5567310	5581536	Of course, the only way really to play this hack, unless you've got some kind of cartridge conversion kit, is through an emulator, and I can say right now it runs very, very well in the different ones that I've played it on.
5582116	5583537	And it plays on Linux!
5584730	5586271	You can do good games on Linux.
5587412	5589414	So, I think it's well worthwhile.
5589754	5593457	I love that boss right there.
5593497	5594698	Looks like a giant pumpkin head.
5594738	5596559	But the actual name of the boss is Ms.
5596659	5597140	Palm.
5597840	5600502	One of the bosses in the game is Jenova.
5601103	5603064	With a G instead of a J. Nice.
5604085	5604686	So, yeah.
5605286	5613693	I totally think that it is... I think, honestly, for SNES RPGs, this one is about the pinnacle.
5614471	5619317	Now, I apologize if I missed it somewhere in your review, but any word on why Square didn't release this over here?
5620819	5621319	I don't know.
5622000	5623101	Just pure stupidity?
5624243	5624843	Lack of faith?
5625784	5628548	The fact that Secret of Evermore did not live up to expectations?
5629958	5636123	Well, um, actually, um, I'm trying to do some look over.
5636384	5645472	They said that, um, that Secret of Evermore was supposed to have been Seiken Densetsu 3, but they brought out something else?
5645592	5646733	I don't really know the whole...
5647453	5651156	Secret of Evermore was Square USA.
5651456	5653898	It was one of the only games Square USA ever did.
5653918	5656680	It might be the only game Square USA ever did.
5657220	5659001	And it didn't do that hot over here.
5659822	5660522	Actually, I owned it.
5660583	5661783	It's not a bad game.
5662304	5664966	It's just not super.
5666053	5680064	Well, part of the other reason is that they were saying that Square was deciding not to translate any more titles for a long time, and they said that it would have been too costly to produce.
5681968	5682269	I know.
5683509	5688791	But, I mean, hey, someone, you know, picked it up and did it.
5689051	5704157	I honestly would love to see them buy the fan translation, you know, pay for the time and effort that went into translating it, and bring it out on the DS.
5704537	5705217	Thank you for watching!
5730506	5734949	That's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but there's plenty more of the show to come.
5734989	5736210	We're just going to take a quick break.
5736270	5737632	We'll be back in just a little bit.
5737972	5740574	We've got still more stories to talk about in Part B tonight.
5740594	5753424	We have Rapid Fire News, your emails, the FUs of the week, and some more stories, including a story on Scribblenauts, and, wait for it, nudity in Part B. That's right, we're going to get naked in Part B tonight.
5753464	5755005	No, just kidding, but we're going to talk about nudity.
5755605	5758668	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5764943	5765364	Thanks for watching!
5781207	5781748	www.allgames.com
5810390	5811251	Worms for iPod and iPod Touch
5833686	5840030	Um, it has 14 multiplayer unlockable items and 50 different challenges to do by yourself.
5840490	5842851	You can customize your team names.
5843311	5845633	Um, so, it's worms.
5846193	5848354	So if you want to be Team Worm, you can.
5848634	5850515	You can be Team Wiggle Worm if you want.
5850635	5851996	I'd rather be dewormed.
5853937	5854117	Ugh.
5854457	5855958	Can I be Team Worm in my pants?
5857599	5857679	Ugh.
5859676	5861177	How about some Xbox stuff?
5861997	5866299	The Xbox Live Arcade Summer of Arcade Games has dates.
5867319	5871001	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles in Time reshelled to be on the 22nd of July.
5871601	5880005	Marvel vs. Capcom 2 with 56 characters coming the week after that.
5880485	5886028	August 5th is Explosion Man and it's a character who can explode himself at will.
5887009	5889310	Yes, he gets very angry and explodes himself.
5889730	5891951	That musical cue is entirely planned.
5892472	5895033	There's 50 single player and 50 multiplayer levels.
5895153	5897374	Trials HD on the 12th of August.
5898354	5902776	It's a motorbike racer, 50 tracks, 2 modes, custom, blah blah blah.
5903436	5908959	Shadow Complex on the 19th of August, which is a side-scrolling adventure game.
5909039	5909919	Metroidvania game.
5910400	5911220	Yeah, Metroidvania.
5913108	5926425	and they will all be 1200 Microsoft points except for Explosion Man which will be 800 points and also some stuff for Guitar Hero 5 actually there are
5928888	5930931	24 songs already confirmed.
5931251	5934576	There will be 84 bands appearing in it.
5935076	5944008	But we've got Band of Horses, Beastie Boys, Beck, Billy Squire, Blur, Bob Dylan, Children of Bodom,
5946730	5964097	Coldplay, Darkest Hour, David Bowie, Deep Purple, Elliot Smith, Iggy Pop, Jeff Beck, John Mellencamp, Kings of Leon, Queens of the Stone Age, Rose Hill Drive, Santana, The Bronx, Thrice, Tom Petty, Running Down a Dream, Vampire Weekend, and Wolf Mother.
5965357	5968158	And... That's it.
5969819	5970119	Alright.
5971444	5975676	What's also interesting, though, is before that got announced, there was actually...
5977915	5978615	DarkSakura.com
6002661	6025053	or not all of all of the things that on the rumor list ended up being on the confirmed list right yes okay just want to make sure that's clear yes um of course uh you know Queen and David Bowie Under Pressure um let's see here also a couple Tom Petty songs uh Tom Petty Running Down a Dream uh Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers American Girl um
6026334	6032479	They even have the gorillas in the game with Feel Good Ink, which will be kind of interesting.
6033339	6039664	Blursong2, Bon Jovi You Give Love a Bad Name, and many, many more.
6042900	6060358	I have to say, if that is real, which it sounds like it is It's actually a pretty freaking good list for Guitar Hero As much crap as I've given the Guitar Hero franchise I will say this song list does make me want to buy Guitar Hero 5 It's a pretty good song list Assuming that it's all correct Which it probably is Yes
6062296	6064197	Um, and then a little bit of bad news.
6064437	6069198	We talked about last week that there was a rumor that maybe the PSP Go was a little bit faster.
6069838	6073539	Um, that, you know, they may have upped the processor to 480 MHz.
6074179	6076119	Yeah, unfortunately that wouldn't be the case.
6076540	6081781	Um, actually that processor speed was referring to the USB speed and not the CPU.
6081861	6085042	So, no, the PSP Go is still not worth your $250.
6085082	6085182	Sorry.
6085202	6085722	Um, and then finally, um,
6091747	6121376	EA made a boo-boo this week posting on their Twitter an announcement for Command & Conquer 4 and kind of jumping the gun a bit actually it did get later officially announced in the next coming days but apparently it was kind of funny because they had the announcement EA Los Angeles announces the development of Command & Conquer 4 and then they had a link to a press release that wasn't there yet so later they added a press release and it was announced dope
6122489	6123269	But still funny.
6124130	6125351	Aren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?
6126311	6130753	Yeah, but I haven't really... I'm a fan of Red Alert, and I actually skipped the last one.
6131774	6137977	I don't know why, but... Yeah, I'm a fan of editing those to death, just like I do Grand Theft Auto 4.
6138778	6139058	All right.
6139414	6140855	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6161814	6186462	on his Twitter actually Quan Chi who is from Mortal Kombat 4 originally the character design for that character showed up on his Twitter so it looks like there was definitely some stuff planned unfortunately now though according to Ed Boon quote right now I don't see it happening apparently all the code though for the characters was just about done but unfortunately now all the attention is focused on Mortal Kombat 9 I guess you can thank all of Midway's recent troubles for that
6187502	6192648	One thing that you can download right now, though, for free even, Elder Scrolls 2, Daggerfall.
6192908	6198013	You may have heard of Elder Scrolls 4, Oblivion, because that was a huge game a couple years ago, and I'm sure Elder Scrolls 5.
6198754	6203338	I'm surprised there's not been an announcement of this, but I guess Fallout 3 was where Bethesda was putting all their resources.
6203739	6207302	But I'm pretty sure next year, I bet you next E3 you're going to see Elder Scrolls 5.
6207382	6207582	Well...
6209324	6210064	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6238581	6260523	one more story for you guys tonight that has to do with the ever asked about Kid Icarus game apparently somebody had asked Miyamoto about it at E3 and his response WAIT PLEASE actually he didn't say it really like that I just said it that way for dramatic effect but he did say wait please I'm really surprised how popular that is but you're the first person to ask this at E3 was apparently his comment about that
6260803	6262064	I can't believe that was the first time.
6262244	6265125	I think that was the first time someone had the balls to ask him about it at E3.
6265465	6266885	But I know it's something a lot of people are asking.
6266905	6268786	It's the first time that you've asked me about that.
6269266	6269647	Apparently.
6270687	6271967	You know, but that's better than no.
6272608	6273108	But I don't know.
6273128	6276049	A lot of people are maybe reading a bit too much into that.
6276429	6277269	Wait, please.
6279090	6280411	Which, by the way, I love that response.
6280451	6281011	I'm going to use that.
6281231	6282812	I'm going to try to use that on the show more often.
6282912	6283612	Wait, please.
6285733	6287554	It does seem a little bit hopeful, but I don't know.
6288454	6288734	I don't know.
6290523	6291144	We'll see though.
6291304	6295448	Perhaps that's another thing that's coming to E3 2010, but of course that's just what all the fanboys think.
6295528	6295728	Yes?
6296069	6296469	Wait, please.
6298471	6300233	That's just like as Frisbee says in chat.
6300273	6300814	Heal, please.
6303436	6304017	Cure, please.
6304918	6305459	Wait, please.
6306701	6307601	How about the game, please?
6308041	6309242	How about emails, please?
6309362	6314683	Every week you guys send us your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we take a few of them and we read them right here on the show.
6315003	6322905	DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag head first, pull out some of her favorite emails and read them for you tonight in our mailbag segment.
6323045	6323765	Whoa, what the hell?
6323785	6325065	That's not the mailbag song.
6325205	6325926	What the crap?
6326826	6327586	How about this instead?
6327626	6328766	Alright, here is the mailbag song.
6329206	6329847	There, much better.
6331187	6332607	Correct song, please.
6333107	6333507	Shut up.
6333948	6334608	Wait, please!
6336584	6338385	Mailbag at Orangelandreda.com DarkSakura
6367284	6367785	For what?
6369086	6369506	I don't know.
6370907	6372408	By the way... Explanation, please.
6372828	6375770	We've had 3D games that used glasses.
6376070	6376410	Hi.
6376930	6378852	We had... The Virtual Boy.
6379892	6380573	That doesn't count.
6380933	6382774	I'm talking about Master System games.
6383735	6384215	You remember?
6384775	6385075	Oh, yeah.
6385116	6387337	They had the 3D glasses for the Master System games.
6388160	6389381	and a few NES games.
6389481	6393503	Actually, there was a version of... Rad Racer had 3D.
6393823	6399587	And it was a game that actually was a predecessor to Space Harrier.
6400167	6403189	It was called Adventure 3D World or something.
6403549	6404690	Oh yeah, 3D World Runner.
6404930	6405470	I remember that game.
6405610	6406110	Like Hooper.
6407600	6411262	So yeah, that's been out and it's failed.
6411362	6416925	Yeah, but a lot of those were just like little, they were flash-in-the-pan stupid things.
6417025	6430672	I mean, let's say there was a legitimate console based around, and let's face it, technology's come a long way since the days of the amazing red, I'm sorry, the amazing red seizure-inducing headache machine, aka the Virtual Boy.
6430932	6432613	Technology's come a long way since then.
6432913	6434274	You know, what if they did
6435234	6436895	Look at what they're doing with a lot of 3D movies.
6437295	6440317	If you haven't seen Up in 3D, it's actually pretty cool.
6440397	6448501	And a lot of these technologies that they're doing with 3D movies, I could see something like this going towards video gaming in the near future, perhaps in the next generation of consoles.
6448861	6453583	I think that's more what our emailer is asking about, maybe not so much this flash-in-the-pan crap we've seen in the past.
6453883	6457025	What if they built a whole new console with today's technology out of 3D gaming?
6457265	6458626	Would it be something you'd be interested in?
6458986	6461607	My honest answer is no, because 3D gaming...
6461747	6467593	I saw Nightmare in 3D twice, so I really think the 3D just, it suits movies more, it really does, or like those little 3D rides like, you know, the Muppet Show in 3D, that type of thing.
6485311	6486772	or Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.
6487272	6488373	Here's my honest answer.
6489453	6495076	If I see the game that convinces me I need the 3D, then I'll be a little more sold on it.
6495116	6500399	But I think it's one of those things where I think the great 3D game idea hasn't been fully realized yet.
6500700	6501280	But who knows?
6501820	6503101	Is it a possibility in the future?
6503201	6503561	Of course.
6503881	6505302	You're going to see 3D games again.
6505842	6506723	It's just a matter of time.
6508664	6510525	We're inching closer and closer to the holodeck.
6512152	6512492	I wish.
6514473	6518875	Next up is from Robert M. Thank you very much for getting the podcast caught up.
6519295	6529518	Lately I haven't been able to tune in live due to long work hours as your show here in the Midwest runs until 11pm and I get up around 5am to get ready for the bus.
6529658	6537201	I'm wondering why Blackwolf isn't yet caught up with his show especially since he's able to get his Friday night show on the feed the next day like clockwork.
6538101	6539502	Looking forward to this week's show.
6540792	6542293	I won't answer for anybody else.
6542313	6545736	I know, we can't answer for anybody else, but we will say it's a lot of work.
6545896	6557684	I do know for a fact he does edit the show, not in a way that's going to edit the content of the show, but he does it to make it sound very professional.
6557704	6561687	He takes out a lot of the dead air and things that we really should do, but are too lazy to.
6562848	6563488	That's a lot of work.
6563849	6568072	I know you guys think it's just easy to slap it together and put it on the podcast, but it does take me a good...
6568752	6569292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6590757	6598081	But, you know, and I'm sure for Bobby who edits his show even further for contextual purposes, it's even more so.
6598321	6600222	So, you know, cut the dude some slack.
6600242	6601523	He works hard doing two shows.
6602402	6614468	One more quick note, I gave my impressions of Phase a year or so ago, and recently upgraded my old video iPod due to dead pixels to an 80GB iPod Classic.
6615089	6624794	It really improves playing games, the older unit had to search for the games and would usually give a game could not be played message before finally successfully loading.
6625274	6627635	Whereas the game loads on this immediately on the classic.
6627775	6629516	Also, the battery life is far improved.
6629897	6641042	Between the solitaire game that comes with it and recently the iPod version, not to be confused with the iPhone one of Peggle, it's admittedly been a while since I've played my DS Lite.
6641683	6642063	P.S.
6642283	6647826	I probably won't get LEGO Rock Band, but I would get a Rock Band LEGO set in a heartbeat.
6649352	6653093	It is interesting how far iPod gaming has come.
6653993	6657074	I mean, FaZe is only, what, like a year and a half, two years old?
6657414	6659435	It is very interesting to see how far the games have come.
6660035	6664976	You know, we've gone from FaZe to TapTap Revenge to, you know, Peggle on the iPhone is pretty sweet.
6665596	6669197	I hope you guys got it during the 99 cent deal because at a buck is a steal.
6669217	6669957	Way got that.
6670257	6671118	Way got that.
6673038	6677462	And by the way, I don't know if you... We tried to post about it on the Twitter because I don't think we had it during a show time.
6677763	6682727	But Columns and Puyo Puyo was free for a limited time over the 4th of July weekend.
6683368	6683628	Got it.
6683869	6685430	You texted me about that.
6685790	6686671	I have to be honest.
6686811	6688553	I wasn't a fan of how the game controlled.
6688853	6689454	I didn't try it.
6689534	6689814	Yaris
6708083	6709725	Last email from Dan Shadow.
6733584	6739492	Hell, the Strong Bad games weren't even announced at that point, not to mention a forthcoming announcement on Wallace and Gromit.
6740012	6742916	I remember mentioning how cool Monkey Island and Loom were.
6743196	6746380	Now here I am, a year later, waiting to play a brand new Monkey Island game.
6746941	6749464	I just wanted to give a toast to video games and how...
6750525	6753967	They bring us such joy before popping the cork on episode one.
6754567	6765333	I also want you guys to pat yourselves on the back to always being there for being the outsiders looking into the world of video games and for making a lengthy show that helps me in the long hours of work.
6765753	6771716	Did you know that OLR is a special tab that people cannot add to their personalized Yahoo front page?
6772136	6773277	That's how I found the show.
6774237	6775398	Completely by accident.
6775578	6776518	Accidentally awesome.
6776618	6776898	Really?
6777239	6777999	How do you do that?
6778119	6779180	I've never even heard of that.
6779240	6779500	I don't know.
6780200	6782463	I think it's RSS feeds.
6783004	6783444	Interesting.
6783484	6785226	I never really looked into that.
6785266	6785647	That's cool.
6786288	6786688	P.S.
6787289	6792755	The email I sent a while back about chocolate and flowers, that was a punch-out Wii reference.
6793666	6796609	PPS, I heard Loom is coming out on Steam soon, is that true?
6796969	6816125	Oh hell yeah, my ass has downloaded it already Oh god, yeah, like a ton of the LucasArts stuff came out this week I'll tell you what, I came close to buying Loom on freaking TurboGrafx Nice I found a place in town that has it, but they want like 35 bucks for it Still I'm close, I'm close What store is that?
6818067	6818307	Oh, okay
6819419	6820500	I'm giving them advertising.
6820540	6821681	She told me off air just now.
6821761	6824824	I'm giving... I'll go ahead and say it.
6824904	6825744	It's fair game.
6826565	6827526	They're pretty good guys.
6827626	6831849	A little high priced, but... They have arcade machines in their store, which is kind of fun.
6832129	6832450	Really?
6832590	6832770	Yes.
6832930	6833671	I've never been there.
6833711	6835552	In all the years I've... I've only been there once.
6835732	6835912	Huh.
6836193	6836653	I should check it out.
6836673	6837454	They sell Saturn games.
6838054	6841637	We were going to go to... They actually do case mods and they do disc resurfacing.
6841917	6849464	Jeff and I were going to go to Deny House today, but the realist in me knew I wouldn't be able to get out of bed early enough to go because it's the weekend and this is where I catch up on my sleep.
6849905	6851927	But don't they sell arcade games out there once in a while, too?
6852828	6853068	Yeah.
6855051	6856913	I'm gonna go on a spree at Denyos, just wait.
6856933	6858374	Trader Dan moved out there too, I think.
6858514	6858754	Nice.
6859095	6861276	They don't sell full-size arcade games out there.
6861477	6861697	Really?
6862157	6862357	No.
6862598	6870745	You'd be hard-pressed to find that stuff, because you'd have to have... I found cocktail tables and sit-down ones there the last time I went to Denyos.
6870765	6876590	There's this one guy that's outside of the flea market proper that has arcade games.
6877450	6879752	It's like in that little outside place where the guy sells the mini-donuts.
6879953	6880133	Hmm.
6880593	6882674	I haven't been to Niall's in like six years.
6882714	6886156	By the way, it's a giant flea market, by the way, for those that have no idea what I'm talking about.
6886596	6888056	A little place here locally in town.
6890157	6892839	But we actually did just buy a game from Fair Game.
6893139	6895980	We bought Captain America and the Avengers for Genesis.
6896280	6896500	Nice.
6896520	6898201	Because the SNES one is ass!
6899642	6903403	And Dan totally reminded me of something, and I totally think this is the truest thing.
6903904	6908025	It's funny when you go fight the Mandarin, and he's like, Behold my power!
6908065	6909086	And then you kill him in five seconds.
6910962	6912422	Thanks for watching!
6936508	6939949	So make sure in your emails you tell us your opinion on anything you send us.
6940009	6940549	I mean, it's cool.
6941429	6945370	But I don't want to say don't send us stories because sometimes we do get some cool stuff that we hadn't heard.
6945990	6951292	But if it was a big story that ran on every blog, yes, we probably heard of it and are talking about it during the show.
6951872	6952812	But we want to know your thoughts.
6953032	6954173	It's always about your voice.
6954353	6955453	Every gamer has a voice, remember?
6956013	6959834	So mailback at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.
6960334	6966916	Let's talk about some more gaming stories with a few more stories before your phone calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6966936	6968717	We've got about five stories for you guys first.
6968797	6969037	Loki.
6969637	6971718	Uh-oh, it's another rumor about PSP 2.
6972438	6973318	Oh my goodness.
6974018	6979860	But yes, of course, you know, with the PSP Go coming out, I guess they've got to be working on a sequel to that.
6980626	6981706	because hey, why not?
6982666	7001850	Anyways, the rumor is that the PSP2 is apparently already in development and that according to some inside info that Eurogamer is allegedly claiming that they got their hands on information that imagine technology's power VR tech will be an important part of the device.
7002650	7006211	And this is without getting into too many technical specifics.
7006491	7008972	The chip codename Hydra will allow for 133 million polygons
7010572	7012053	Thanks for watching!
7027205	7029107	So, you know, that's not bad.
7029707	7032990	You know, PlayStation 2 quality graphics, it kind of makes sense.
7034051	7042878	And apparently the chip, I guess, will act as both the GPU and CPU simultaneously, increasing power efficiency and helping the other areas of the programming for the device.
7044279	7045380	And that's just rumor right now.
7046332	7046892	We'll see you next time.
7066806	7070067	I'm still not fully sure I understand what the Hydra chip does.
7070087	7071728	I'm not as big into hardware stuff.
7071748	7073909	What exactly will the Hydra chip mean for this system?
7074129	7080992	Basically, it's just a powerful chip that's going to process both the graphics stuff and the actual game processing.
7081412	7087355	It's just a chip that's using PowerVR technology.
7088715	7092037	It's just going to basically make games look like the PlayStation 2
7093621	7095001	Able to be played on a portable system.
7095281	7096002	But will it blend?
7097022	7097822	Everything blends.
7098142	7098422	Oh, okay.
7099162	7100243	Well, that's the important thing, I guess.
7100643	7105604	Very interesting, though, that we are getting all these details about the PSP2 with the PSP Go still on the horizon.
7105664	7108364	I mean, this is something that's happened at Sony camp before.
7108764	7114886	Not to pinpoint that that only happens to Sony, because I seem to remember this whole little, like... The Gizmodo?
7114966	7119187	Yeah, you kind of hear about these things, or the newer N-Gage while the other N-Gage was still out, you know...
7120167	7121028	That was the Gizmondo.
7121408	7128653	Oh, by the way, we're going to release a widescreen version of the system before the actual system comes out.
7129334	7130214	Yeah, that didn't help.
7130935	7135278	TigerClaw in chat says, a graphic chip that powerful also means low battery life.
7137145	7138826	Unless they figure out something, you know.
7139507	7140708	Well, what if this is just a unit?
7140808	7144611	I mean, I'm surprised we don't see a unit that just plugs right into the wall.
7144891	7147453	And I'm not even talking about with a charger or anything like that.
7147513	7150575	You just flip out the little plug thing and just plug it right in the wall.
7150895	7151596	Wouldn't that be cool?
7152817	7154238	No, it's supposed to be a portable system.
7154278	7155719	Why the hell do I have to be tethered to a wall?
7155739	7156039	No, no, no.
7156199	7156760	To charge it.
7157040	7158301	Like, the battery is built in.
7159101	7159822	Like a cell phone.
7160202	7160983	Yeah, it should be.
7161314	7162715	Yeah, it should be.
7162775	7168457	But then they couldn't sell you the replacement batteries or the upgrade batteries or all the other fun stuff.
7168477	7174099	I mean, I'm not even talking about, like, okay, because probably folks are going, you retard DS and PSP do that where you plug them into the wall.
7174459	7176460	I'm talking about without even an AC adapter.
7176800	7181182	Like, you just flick out the little, like, you know, I don't, you flick out the little plug in the back and just plug it right in your wall.
7181222	7182342	Like your cell phone, like you said.
7182623	7184543	Yeah, well, not all cell phones have that either.
7185124	7185304	Yeah.
7185544	7185824	I don't know.
7186741	7202970	Well, here's... Why don't they do something like... Well, actually, they're sort of working on technology for that, where you can charge stuff wirelessly, where you actually have... For example, they have Wii batteries that you can get for the remotes that will actually charge through...
7203971	7204391	everything.
7204911	7206112	That is scary.
7206192	7207292	How does that work?
7207392	7207933	I don't know.
7208273	7209513	Black magic, apparently.
7210674	7211734	That is, wow.
7211754	7213035	But yeah, they have them.
7213615	7214915	Actually, they sell them now.
7215036	7215596	You can buy them.
7215616	7219877	You basically sit the controller onto the pad.
7219937	7221418	It doesn't have any contacts.
7221458	7223959	You can leave that stupid silicon thing on it and stuff.
7224319	7227681	And apparently it charges through the air.
7228401	7233583	So that's kind of scary because I don't want electricity flying through the air and electrocuting me, you know.
7234451	7236613	That is kind of strange how that works.
7236753	7237774	Technology's weird.
7237974	7241637	But yeah, I want to say Energizer had... Frisbee says it's powered by hamsters.
7242818	7250245	I'm just going to believe that, that there's miniature hamsters and those things that power them instead of electricity flying through the air like a bad science fiction movie.
7250265	7252507	I'll see if I can find the information on it because it's just...
7253427	7255588	It makes it sound like... Remember those globes?
7255688	7258690	And I'm sure they still have them, but they were popular when I was a kid.
7259610	7263312	You'd see on Mr. Wizard's World and shit, the big globes that had the lightning in them.
7263352	7264112	This still does at Spencer's, Rob.
7264152	7267513	And then when you put your fingers on the edge of them, the lightning bolts jump to your fingers.
7267854	7271315	That's what I think of when I hear this whole charging through the air.
7271555	7274216	I think my house is going to turn into one of those globes.
7276237	7276637	Yeah, it's...
7279167	7282690	I know... Oh, this is one of them, I think.
7283631	7285052	Was it the InCharge?
7287574	7288594	Oh, that's not one.
7288735	7289055	Never mind.
7289535	7292458	But yeah, I want to say it was Energizer or something like that that put it out.
7292538	7293839	It was one battery company.
7293899	7295440	I can't remember who put it out.
7295500	7298863	But it's crazy looking.
7299223	7299823	Oh, Energizer.
7299843	7300104	Here it is.
7300724	7304227	It uses induction charging, is what it is.
7304727	7304907	And...
7308463	7319740	Energizer Wiimote Wireless Induction Charger That's scary shit Black magic I say, it's black magic It's a witch!
7321383	7321863	Burn the witch!
7322044	7323285	We found a witch, may we burn her?
7325930	7326370	Dragon Age Origins
7350948	7358654	and apparently Bioware is currently debating if the game should contain full frontal nudity because the game does have some sex scenes in it.
7358874	7359594	More cock!
7360515	7365539	So, apparently the sex will be portrayed in cutscene-controlled environments only.
7365799	7372564	There is not going to be any type of gameplay, so sorry, no hot coffee minigame where you control the thrusting or what have you.
7372624	7374125	It's part of the cinematics.
7374745	7378788	But apparently in the game, you are going to be able to have sex with computer-controlled party members and
7379088	7381690	in order to improve your relationship with them.
7382791	7383512	Like real life.
7385333	7390237	Apparently, this game was actually shown to the press behind closed doors at E3, so that means we wouldn't have seen it.
7390817	7393660	But the sex scenes were not shown in full.
7393700	7396842	They were cut very short after they started.
7397242	7400185	By the way, of course, Mass Effect allowed the characters to have sex.
7400505	7401286	But here's the thing.
7402046	7407490	When VideoGamer.com asked the BioWare vice president, Greg Zeschuk,
7408211	7409131	He replied, quote,
7437728	7438148	DarkSakura.com
7465399	7466760	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7487190	7490272	But I don't understand why our culture gets so wrapped up in this.
7490732	7493474	Especially when, oh my god, there might be tits in a video game.
7493835	7494415	So what?
7494495	7496817	My god, do you know how violent games have gotten?
7497097	7499879	We've heard every word possible in a game at this point.
7500319	7501860	I mean, fuck, shit, cock.
7501920	7503641	They've all been in a video game at some point.
7504061	7507304	And even if they weren't in the game, many kids put them in anyway.
7507344	7508845	It's the name of their characters.
7509245	7513868	Who didn't have that Final Fantasy party where all your character names were cock, piss, tits, and ball?
7514028	7514668	I actually didn't.
7514708	7515749	I named mine after my friends.
7515969	7516370	Whatever.
7516610	7517810	You know what I'm getting at, though, right?
7519271	7520692	I'm just being difficult.
7521032	7525755	If games are getting closer and closer to movies, if it fits the context of the game, why not?
7526416	7528557	I mean, and it's not like we've never had it before.
7528617	7531599	I mean, God of War had it, and we've seen them in other games.
7531619	7535342	Final Fantasy VII, the big deal with that was that Barret cussed.
7536482	7538063	I mean, really, what's the big deal?
7538083	7541686	It's just people who, you know, got a big butt up their butt.
7542166	7542266	Yeah.
7543044	7544525	A butt up their butt?
7544545	7549787	I said a bug up their butt I thought you said a big butt up their butt Isn't that a little redundant?
7550267	7553929	No, I have a big bug up their butt You've heard that phrase before
7554614	7557876	Frisbee in chat says, because boobs are worse than decapitation.
7558236	7560517	Sadly, in our culture, it seems that way, doesn't it?
7560777	7564839	It's because the people are so freaking repressed.
7565460	7566300	I mean, seriously.
7566720	7568961	And this is what I say about damn near everything.
7569001	7573324	You stop making such a big fucking deal out of it, and guess what?
7573624	7575285	It stops being a big fucking deal.
7577566	7579347	It was like, okay, for example...
7580583	7582423	You can say, fuck now.
7583284	7584664	Okay?
7584764	7586144	I was always able to say fuck.
7586824	7588545	Let me finish.
7588665	7596346	200 years ago, if you said, fuck, you could be put in stocks and displayed for being profane.
7596566	7597266	What the fuck?
7598267	7599167	But you see what I mean?
7599947	7601347	Our language has evolved.
7601527	7604408	Our idea of morality has evolved.
7607789	7609269	I could go on and on about that.
7610350	7633407	it's it's just they're gonna die Rob all of those people with the big moral you know stick up their butt so I don't say you know bug up their butt they have a big butt up their butt growing up their ass they're they're gonna die it's gonna they're gonna die okay me some people gonna die you know what I mean though
7635823	7639147	People are going to move on.
7641049	7649678	What is morally acceptable today is going to be tame, tame, tame 30 years from now.
7649959	7655264	There's always going to be repressed people out there.
7657046	7662948	Why do we have a comment in chat from Leachum6 that says, I think DarkSakura should shove Loki's butt up Rob's butt.
7663248	7664768	How mature are we, people?
7664948	7665749	Jesus.
7666949	7668169	How would that even work?
7669430	7671930	Why am I even trying to justify a comment like that?
7671970	7672530	What the hell?
7673371	7674091	Only in our chat.
7674131	7677312	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Here's what I have to say.
7678752	7679753	More boobies!
7680913	7681833	More cock!
7682913	7684834	And not the animated porn star, by the way.
7686075	7687076	Michael Moorcock.
7688396	7690777	I saw it at the Lighthouse bookstore.
7691338	7693599	I was liking this more boobies tangent you were going down.
7693659	7697381	Explain, how should gamers incorporate boobies into the games?
7698241	7704964	I think that they should get those boob balls from realdoll.com and just put them on top of their Xbox.
7705965	7710187	And then when they feel aggression at their game, they hit pause and go play with some boobies.
7712682	7715704	Look, I don't think you want to make the boob usage juvenile.
7715824	7728471	I mean, which unfortunately, that's the kind of crap that ruins it for everybody is that when boobies in video games becomes more acceptable, then you're going to see more of that stuff like, you know, Boob Slapper 5000 on the Wii or something like that.
7728491	7729112	I'd buy that.
7729312	7729892	Garbage.
7729972	7731473	You know, it's just absolute garbage.
7731893	7734855	But, you know, I think if boobs is done tastefully.
7734875	7736776	There's going to be garbage on the Wii regardless.
7737136	7739298	I'd rather see it all be adult garbage.
7739338	7739698	You know what?
7740225	7745909	If there were more party game collections that were all adult party games, I think that we'd get a lot more purchases.
7745929	7748731	Well, the gaming industry is probably worried about the porn market.
7748852	7750533	I mean, think about it.
7751213	7755977	Could that open up the floodgates to interactive porn on the Wii or the DS?
7756517	7760741	Not like there's not interactive porn on the PC already, Rob.
7761601	7764784	I mean, we've got Red Light District and Second Life and...
7766477	7770078	If there is a way to put porn on something... Yeah, but Second Life doesn't count because it's furries.
7770918	7774219	If there is a way to put porn on something, porn will be on something.
7774839	7777000	People are obsessed with the nookie.
7778240	7782622	They will... If they're not getting it in their real life, they will find some way of simulating it.
7784542	7790244	It's just... And this is what I don't get why people are so repressed over everything.
7790724	7794985	It's just that... Hi, humans, for the most part, are wired to fuck.
7796488	7797049	End of story.
7798510	7815344	It is, whether or not you want to procreate, whether or not you have an interest in whatever gender one has an interest in, or even what species one has an interest in, human beings, for the most part, are wired to fuck.
7817326	7818807	That is a genetic imperative.
7818948	7820269	That is built into the DNA.
7822299	7829144	And while some people are not wired to fuck, and I, you know, fully mean people, fantastic.
7829164	7831546	Asexual, right?
7831746	7831926	Yes.
7832407	7833587	Some people are wired that way.
7834468	7835869	Most people are wired to fuck.
7836470	7850360	Including all of those repressed right-wing, you know, Republican assholes who want to, you know, or all of those, you know, religious right people, you know.
7852296	7854678	How many of them have we heard of?
7855538	7872951	Oh, having affairs with Playboy Bunnies in the 80s, or senators getting blowjobs in the bathroom, or governors running off to Argentina to go get some Argentinian nookie.
7874650	7889502	I'm looking at some of the stuff in the chatroom at chat.orangeandreja.com Obviously a chat like this is getting a big response Joshi16 says DarkSakura for President 2012 More boobies, more cock Let's see, what else do we have here?
7890302	7895206	Frisbee said Kevin Smith said that he was going to put more cock in his films because one of his movies got an NC-17 at first
7896787	7897728	It is a little silly.
7898348	7899389	I mean, and think about it.
7899429	7904372	If you could put this type of stuff in our culture, you could show people how to do it the safe way.
7905013	7911117	Like, imagine if people did this, but they would stop and put on a condom first.
7911217	7915380	It might help put the image of safe sex out there, which is smart.
7915400	7921024	It should all be handled like it was in The Naked Gun, where they had the full-body condom.
7922005	7922225	Nice.
7922505	7924327	But no, I mean, really...
7928047	7942138	It is, it's, I think that it's just the whole, there's, I mean, okay, it's like the little kid who knows something is bad and he does it anyway because there's that risk involved.
7942158	7943899	He's doing something naughty, you know.
7945160	7950785	It's like, you know, wanting to go sneak out and buy, you know, and smoke pack cigarettes even though it's really disgusting.
7951425	7953147	You know, it's that same type of...
7954850	7957913	You know, it's something dangerous.
7957973	7960076	It's something, you know, not accepted.
7961117	7964100	Whereas you go to another country and it's like, so?
7965181	7966002	Yay, boobs.
7966382	7967724	Let's bring it back to video games.
7967784	7968044	I'm sorry.
7968425	7969045	No, that's all right.
7969145	7971308	Let's bring it back to video games and try to close out the topic.
7971428	7973370	Well, just my point is that there should be more boobs in video games.
7973763	7973923	F.U.S.
7974063	7974323	of the Week
8009758	8020564	But we have something to, of course, inspire the angst this week, and that would be this story about a child porn collector who blamed games for fueling his obsession.
8021664	8035552	This is a London man who said, and I don't know why his name isn't out here, but the London Free Press didn't run it, apparently said he lived in a closed box of friendless fantasy, and it was fueled by video games, his computer, and comic books.
8036172	8038894	I'd work, come home, lock myself in the apartment...
8040258	8048181	After a difficult childhood in foster care where he was separated from his siblings, he became a truck driver who lived by himself in squalor and clinical depression.
8048622	8051983	He was in a black hole, a strange sort of world his computer created.
8054624	8058766	Dude, I think your issues go far beyond what your computer made you do.
8059366	8062107	Your computers and video games don't control your actions.
8062668	8064268	You, sir, control your actions.
8064808	8068190	And, yeah, Facepalm, if I've ever heard that.
8068755	8071457	So, yes, how about some angst dedicated towards this guy this week?
8071477	8072718	The FU's of the week, DarkSakura.
8073738	8077461	FU to the stitch that got popped and the other stitch that regressed into my hand.
8078662	8081984	They're all coming out on Tuesday, but they hurt.
8083185	8083845	It hurts a lot.
8084906	8085807	So, fuck that.
8088762	8093983	Big ol' fuck you to Kimberly Block and also Jason K. Singleton.
8094283	8097864	You may not be familiar with them unless you live in the Sacramento area of California.
8099204	8111947	They are two shysters, basically, that are using the American Disability Act to file lawsuits against numerous businesses causing them to basically settle with them to get money.
8112441	8113681	I heard about this on the news.
8113741	8123585	I don't know if it was the same people, but I heard about this like 80 businesses got sued or something and the people never even visited them.
8123805	8126206	Yes, and basically this is happening again.
8126226	8128427	This woman has filed four lawsuits.
8128707	8130767	Now you may be asking yourself, why the hell do I care about this?
8131087	8132968	Because it comes back to hamburgers.
8133568	8141031	And that's because they are closing, they are forcing the squeeze in, which you may have seen them on the Food Network, a really small place at
8141391	8142312	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8165072	8168953	To be fair, I think they should be able to serve the handicapped.
8168993	8170113	Yeah, but they do.
8170213	8172074	Ring a bell, you know, or something.
8172174	8173254	They do, and they're willing.
8173554	8175434	And the problem is, though, she doesn't give a shit.
8175494	8183576	She probably has never been here, and the businesses that she sued are, like, within... Like, there's two liquor stores, like, nine miles away from where she lives.
8183656	8186756	Like, who the fuck would drive nine miles to a liquor store?
8186816	8187957	I mean, this is Sacramento.
8188157	8189897	There's, like, a liquor store in every corner, so...
8190680	8193586	You know, it's obviously just for the money is all it's about.
8193667	8199680	And this guy in Eureka or whatever the attorney is doing, he has like 164 lawsuits out there, all ADA cases, so...
8202779	8203259	Way to go!
8203459	8207262	Thank you for closing a historic neighborhood, or a historic restaurant.
8207942	8209803	I'm okay with these lawsuits.
8211344	8212244	Well, hold on, hold on.
8212965	8213665	Hold on, I'm finished.
8214146	8228914	If the business really is insensitive towards handicapped needs, you know, even if the person lives far away, if the business really truly is insensitive towards handicapped needs, but it sounds like these places, you know, they will make it work.
8228934	8231816	You know, ring the bell, honk the horn, you know,
8232436	8233657	They have no sugar on it.
8255377	8257878	You know the point I'm trying to get at.
8258699	8266562	The whole thing is the Disability Act in and of itself is severely flawed.
8266982	8273845	There are people who qualify for the Disability Act who really are perfectly innate.
8273905	8276686	You know, for like Handicap Parking Placards or something.
8277227	8281509	Who... Now... Like... Okay.
8281749	8282709	I'm trying to remember what it is.
8282729	8283990	It's like if you have...
8284847	8286708	Problems balancing your checkbook.
8287768	8289930	You can actually qualify for a disabled parking.
8291550	8291951	Interesting.
8292351	8303877	I mean, it's really... The legislation on it is so flawed that almost anyone can squeeze in and qualify for some sort of thing under the Disabilities Act.
8303897	8304797	It needs to be modernized.
8305017	8307498	It really does need to be completely revamped.
8307779	8309820	I know people personally who...
8311020	8312943	definitely should have the Placard.
8313303	8313764	Oh yeah.
8314244	8317268	Definitely qualify for the benefits under these.
8317408	8321833	There's people I know who should qualify and for some reason do not.
8322453	8323935	And I think it's entirely unfair.
8323955	8325577	You know, but like
8327327	8332089	I think that there is... I put this in the same category... Oh god, I'm going to get political again.
8332169	8333950	I'm just going to put this as briefly as I can.
8334370	8336511	I put this in the same category as welfare.
8337712	8339232	There's a lot of room for abuse.
8339973	8343154	And if people can get a free ride, they will get a free ride.
8344155	8347256	I think that there needs to be more enabling services.
8347876	8351018	Instead of, you know, pandering services.
8352899	8353899	And we'll leave it at that.
8353959	8355280	I think that's so stupid...
8357586	8359808	I think all of this should be thrown out as frivolous.
8360328	8362230	I think all of this should be thrown out as frivolous.
8362470	8365893	She has a personal experience in those places.
8365933	8367354	That where they refuse to help her.
8368095	8368775	Or accommodate her.
8369796	8372899	If the business wants your money, they will accommodate you.
8374756	8375276	Thanks for watching!
8396556	8400079	Anyhow, let's get back to some more gaming news.
8400119	8405663	We just have about three more stories for you guys, and then it's going to be time for you guys to call in 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8405964	8409386	DarkSakura, you have a story for us about... I sure do.
8410407	8412129	Plants vs. Zombies!
8412509	8414571	It's coming out on other platforms.
8415692	8426000	Right now it's only on PC and Mac, but PopCap is talking about working on an Xbox Live Arcade version, I do believe, and possibly on iPhone.
8427119	8430142	If there's a way they can work it into World of Warcraft, I'm sure they will too.
8430682	8430862	Yeah.
8432844	8434526	They're so crazy with their PopCap games.
8434566	8438049	By the way, did you hear this week about the World of Warcraft Pagle game?
8438449	8448699	Not just now the mod within World of Warcraft, because it's very clear there is some PopCap employees that are addicted to World of Warcraft, because you've noticed these little, like...
8450240	8451121	and DarkSakura.
8479283	8480724	I think there's furious dry humping.
8480924	8481464	You know what, though?
8481624	8483206	They're all free, so we all win.
8483466	8485067	So I'm not going to complain.
8485768	8486929	They were all free expansions.
8487329	8488970	It's brand awareness.
8489651	8492934	It gets all the stories covered on blogs and all that, so good for them.
8493834	8494355	Dry humping?
8494495	8496817	I think these type of partnerships I'd like to see happen more often.
8497137	8500199	I'd like to see more mutual masturbation going on in the gaming world.
8500239	8501000	I don't know about you guys.
8501240	8502361	Furious humping.
8502781	8503242	Exactly.
8504537	8511082	Well, a game that I don't think will have furious humping in it, Scribblenauts has been rated by the ESRB.
8511802	8515986	And as creative as the game is, their description of it is just as creative.
8517106	8521990	Of course, they are talking, you know, now the ESRB is required to have...
8523511	8525633	Little synopsis of the games.
8525893	8527114	And basically here's what they put.
8528175	8529836	Scribblenauts, which is rated E10+.
8529916	8538282	This is a puzzle game in which players navigate a series of traps, puzzles, and enemies to collect stars scattered throughout the colorful levels.
8538942	8543506	Players have the ability to summon different objects by writing slash typing in the words.
8543906	8545907	Example, bike, spaceship, lion.
8546308	8547248	And watch it come to life.
8547308	8549310	If multiple words are entered in a sequence...
8550010	8552772	Different whimsical scenarios can be triggered.
8552872	8554753	A bicycle can be used to jump over a baby.
8555113	8556894	A bulldozer can clear away a shark.
8557414	8559495	A cabbage can be fed to a dinosaur.
8560115	8564497	Players can elect to summon cartoony versions of bats, bombs, guns, and flamethrowers.
8564898	8568519	These types of items can be used to destroy objects or even other summoned items.
8569220	8572121	For example, a club can be used to hit an animal.
8572501	8575263	A stake can be attached to a baby to attract lions.
8575943	8577444	Rockets can be lobbed at a man.
8577844	8579345	That in itself is so amazing.
8579385	8582306	You can attach a steak to a baby to attract animals.
8583226	8583526	Love it.
8584286	8584607	Sweet.
8585127	8593310	These triggered animations are minimally depicted and usually accompanied by a popping musical sound effect, bright star-shaped flashes, or small puffs of smoke.
8593370	8598612	If a player wishes to, they may type the word and vomit, which causes a beige-colored lump to appear on the screen.
8600133	8603374	God, if this is not the game of the year, I don't know what is.
8605191	8605351	Oh, and...
8631149	8642097	On top of that, recognizing that this is going to be a success, they would like to see Scribblenauts come to other platforms.
8642398	8645360	We've never limited ourselves to the DS as a platform.
8645900	8648662	In our heads, we'll see what the future holds.
8648722	8656128	Personally, we think that would be a hit on any platform, whether that platform would be an Xbox 360, PS3, or who knows.
8658148	8661231	and that's coming from Marius Falbush I thought bad things
8667219	8668860	Yeah, I bet you did after the boobie story.
8669760	8679203	I think, though, this game is going to inspire folks to trade whimsical answers to scenarios on the internet, like the most wacky fucking ways to beat levels that you've ever heard of.
8679323	8680584	I think that could be interesting.
8680604	8683084	It also has level swapping and custom levels.
8683185	8683745	Oh, I didn't know that.
8683785	8684405	That's pretty cool.
8684665	8684885	Yes.
8685885	8686586	We'll see what happens.
8686986	8690187	I wonder if there's going to be one foolproof way to beat every level, though.
8690827	8692750	There's going to be different ways to beat levels.
8694171	8695152	It's almost like golf.
8695392	8703982	You have pars in the game where you're trying to beat the level with X number of objects spawned, that type of thing.
8704562	8710469	I seem to remember even in the free mode that we were messing around with, there was a meter as to how many objects you could have at one time.
8710829	8712471	I could see them doing things with that meter.
8714372	8718256	Joshi16 in our chatroom, chat.orangeonsradio.com says, I want it on the PC Mac.
8719057	8721840	And DarkTetsuya says, yeah, I look forward to the GameFAQs entries on it.
8723702	8727666	I wonder if you can summon dirty words or if the game just scolds you for trying to put them in.
8727686	8728526	No, it just won't recognize them.
8729027	8730408	What if you put in like feces?
8731589	8732931	Will it not even recognize that?
8733593	8734554	Um, I don't know.
8734834	8735515	It may do poop.
8735735	8736435	You could do vomit.
8736475	8737316	Why can't you do poo?
8738117	8738377	I don't know.
8738397	8738677	We'll see.
8738697	8739318	Poop would be in there.
8739558	8740359	You should have poop rocket.
8740379	8742020	We should have tried poop rocket.
8742860	8744262	I don't think that's in the dictionary.
8744302	8745923	Or like poop flinging monkey.
8748125	8748645	Alright, we'll see.
8748665	8751287	Or what have you... Yeah, tiger claw brings up a good point.
8751327	8752648	Penis is not even a dirty word.
8752708	8753689	It's a scientific word.
8754269	8754990	It's still not in the game.
8755390	8756972	Dark Tetsuya says, so no cocks?
8757312	8759794	I think you should be able to put in cock and a little rooster shows up.
8760882	8763052	Put in fag and a cigarette shows up.
8763193	8763675	Why not?
8765643	8766943	Just do the literal meaning.
8795014	8795594	Alright, anyhow.
8796735	8803258	Do you remember, we talked a while, I'm sure at length about this on the show before, about the whole Wii's new demo play feature?
8803499	8807221	This is where you'd be able to pause the game and just skip scenes like it was a DVD.
8807941	8810642	Or get walked through certain scenarios in the game.
8811063	8811643	Well, guess what?
8813052	8823336	This week it was announced that through a blurb in Nikkei newspaper in Japan, the feature will be used in portable games as well.
8823576	8825017	That means it's coming to the DS.
8826417	8829819	Sorry, the newspaper referred to it as skip functionality, a skip feature, if you will.
8830679	8834221	It's also supposed to be used for high-speed action games.
8835001	8835581	Interesting.
8836522	8836682	So...
8837842	8843024	Who knows what this could bring for DS games in the future, but this does seem to be the future of Nintendo.
8843044	8844045	The future of gaming?
8844705	8848186	Well, I guess that's all in how the general public responds to it.
8848527	8848927	We'll see.
8850598	8851639	That's that for demo play.
8852239	8858241	Alright, let's open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8858281	8863183	But do keep in mind, if you are going to use Skype to call us, please make sure you test your connection first to ECHO123.
8863263	8868144	So again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8868905	8871325	Do we have some last minute stories we want to get into while we wait for some calls?
8871345	8874506	Because there's a little bit of a delay between us and when they hear us on Orange Lounge Radio.
8874847	8875287	Nope, never mind.
8875307	8876007	We're getting a call right now.
8876347	8876627	I lied.
8877187	8878328	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8878348	8878648	Who's this?
8880148	8886851	Well, BlazBlue is a fighting game that's supposed to be the spiritual successor to Guilty Gear.
8886951	8886991	Um...
8907682	8913303	I think the total is 12 characters that you get to play as, so you've got a smaller roster list.
8914123	8916664	But they're pretty balanced, actually.
8917404	8923025	And the game is, well, I think of it as an easier Guilty Gear, actually.
8924585	8927366	The button layout is just four buttons.
8929926	8935147	You've got light, make them strong, and then a button you use to do cool shit.
8938311	8939632	Are you a big fighting game fan?
8939672	8941834	Like, do you play a lot of the fighters that come out?
8943515	8943855	Oh, yeah.
8944095	8950160	I'm actually looking forward to Maul vs. Calcom 2 coming out at the end of the month, and King of Fighters 12.
8950941	8960028	Okay, so I just wanted to kind of gauge your, like, experience and love for fighting game before I ask this next question, and that would be, how does BlazBlue, in your opinion, stack up to other fighting games?
8962229	8966913	It's a slower Guilty Gear, I guess, but...
8968122	8988242	my opinion is it's faster than Street Fighter 4 it's a really cool it's just a really cool fighting game
8988544	8989044	King of Fighters 12
9011452	9015393	and all these games, especially the Neo Geo ones, are coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
9016134	9025017	When you can get these games for $10, $15 a pop, does that make $60 or $50, whatever BlazBlue costs, worth it in comparison?
9026898	9037261	Well, when you look at the online of those games, I have Garo, Mark of the Wolves, but from the times I played, online was total trash, actually.
9039102	9039302	But
9040032	9066248	and BlazBlue, it's, you know, you're getting a high-definition fighter with a complete story mode and the story mode, some of the characters are, like, really interesting and, you know, you follow their path and even, like, characters, like, you know, they had me saying, wow, a fighting game can have this good a story
9066755	9071177	Like sometimes I was actually laughing my ass off at some characters' wackiness.
9071398	9082684	Sometimes, you know, I was feeling bad for a character because, you know, I personally think that they're pathetic and, you know, but, you know, they just keep fighting.
9083587	9085648	I just got a PS3 and I just wanted to say it's awesome so far and I
9113516	9119884	Best Buy, I don't know if they're doing this for all of them, but they have Valkyria Chronicles on clearance for only $15.
9119984	9124069	It's a great pickup and, you know, very cheap.
9124529	9125691	There's Best Buy over here in San Antonio.
9132229	9134689	I might have to try and find that here locally.
9134870	9135790	Awesome.
9136510	9138210	One other quick question for you.
9139190	9140470	I'm always kind of curious.
9140791	9144231	When people plunk down $300, $400 for a new console, I always want to ask this.
9144791	9145431	Why now?
9145491	9147152	What made you decide to take the plunge now?
9148592	9149192	Two things.
9150052	9155933	One, they had this bundle going on with the Killzone 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4.
9156453	9160454	I wanted to pick that up because I think for $400, that kind of justifies it.
9161155	9163636	because in the next month we're supposed to be getting a price cut.
9164677	9169179	So those two extra games, I don't know, they kind of seem to me to even it out.
9169799	9177043	And plus, next month in August, there's supposed to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Blu-ray box set that I really want to pick up.
9178143	9178504	All right.
9178964	9179144	Okay.
9179384	9182886	Well, thank you very much for your thoughts and opinions tonight and have fun with your PlayStation 3, all right?
9183986	9184186	All right.
9184206	9184747	Thank you very much.
9184927	9185347	You're welcome.
9185387	9186247	And LittleBigPlanet.
9186347	9186788	It's awesome.
9187048	9187388	Seriously.
9188666	9190967	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9191068	9192268	It's GS68 Hi, GS68, what's on your mind?
9207887	9213071	I'm going to get back from California Extreme, which I'm guessing DarkSakura wasn't able to go to this year.
9213311	9220176	Yeah, you know, DarkSakura had the issues with her hand, so if she went, she wouldn't really be able to play the video games because of her hand.
9220196	9220316	I know.
9220957	9221517	Bummer, right?
9221597	9226281	And then I was going to go, but I had a conflict with the Rocky Reno show I'm doing.
9226321	9229643	I had a rehearsal this weekend, and it sucked because I was in the bay.
9229783	9231184	I wasn't that far away.
9231505	9235688	It would have only taken me like 30 minutes to get there, but by the time we were done, California Extreme would have been done.
9236108	9237189	So it just didn't...
9237828	9238708	Wait, when?
9238948	9239549	Oh, did it really?
9240149	9241789	Shut up, I thought it was done at like 9 o'clock.
9242730	9243990	Ah, oh well, it doesn't matter.
9244230	9250452	I wouldn't have gotten my money's worth, but I know we keep saying we're going to go every year and then some damn thing happens.
9250512	9251753	It's just the worst time of year.
9251793	9253373	The summer is so, so busy.
9253754	9254514	But you went.
9254594	9255874	How did you enjoy yourself?
9257475	9259375	It was alright.
9260476	9264457	It felt like a little less games this year, I'm not sure.
9265077	9266518	Because it's only my second year going.
9269035	9270656	Well, what kind of games did you get a chance to play?
9270916	9278900	By the way, for those that have never been to California Extreme before, it's basically just a bunch of old school arcade games in a convention center.
9279200	9280621	You pay some money to get in.
9280941	9281502	Have fun.
9281642	9283182	That's basically what it is.
9283202	9284643	It's a traveling arcade.
9284703	9289806	I'm looking at older games with a few 90s, 2000s games thrown in.
9290826	9297150	I didn't feel high school wasn't finicky, but I couldn't get on the top 10, so...
9298171	9298631	Fuck that.
9298651	9299952	Yeah, I saw it.
9299972	9303953	I probably got a chance to play it, because when I was a kid, I'd see it in tilt all the time, but it never really interested me.
9303973	9304054	Yeah.
9327478	9327818	Nice.
9328658	9330379	Man, it looks like you guys had a lot of fun.
9332040	9338282	I got around to playing Cosmo Gang, and if you play Point Blank to an advanced, this is like the final stage of advanced mode.
9338822	9340263	No, the final stage of insane mode.
9341763	9344344	Where there are a lot of... I'm sorry, go ahead.
9346445	9353568	Where, like, you have these cartoon aliens coming down trying to steal your energy cubes, and you have to shoot them to keep them away.
9354308	9356029	Otherwise, if they take an energy cube, you lose.
9357287	9360348	Hey, I worked at a Namco arcade for a long time.
9360388	9366210	I love that game.
9366350	9374453	And then I saw Pachinko Machine, which was really cool, but I never got to play because by the time I thought about playing it, it was gone.
9374814	9376034	They are already packing it up.
9376054	9377875	It's kind of surreal seeing it, especially considering...
9386983	9388544	The man died a few weeks ago.
9388844	9390665	Well, you know, the machines were made.
9390705	9391265	They're out there.
9391345	9392546	But yeah, I get what you're saying.
9392626	9397308	It's kind of interesting to see that out in the wild right now with all the stuff in the media.
9397648	9401610	But, well, what would you say was your favorite thing that you played at the show out of everything?
9403030	9406732	Once I heard of Tyler's play Rush 2049 because it had an eight-player setup.
9407733	9408913	Wow, nice.
9409073	9411654	Getting to play it the way it's intended with all eight people.
9411894	9412275	Nice.
9414616	9414956	Yeah.
9415703	9419664	Was there any garbage that you played where you were like, man, they should have just left this at home?
9422464	9428346	There's a number of games that I played and didn't really recall enjoying for too long.
9428606	9431606	Let's see.
9433747	9437207	It came across a pretty interesting game called Chillers.
9437307	9445329	It's like a game with one of those mountain gun things, and you have to shoot monsters to go on from one stage to the next, but
9445984	9454306	Sometimes the things you shoot are corpses, like naked corpses in portrait chambers and such.
9454366	9456127	That was very weird.
9456467	9458787	That does sound very weird, but okay.
9458907	9459988	Whatever makes you happy, I guess.
9460388	9464489	Well, it sounds like you had a good time at the show, and I swear we're really going to try and make it next year.
9464509	9466549	It just depends on the personal schedules and everything.
9466589	9468250	Hopefully no surgeries or nothing like that.
9468690	9471370	But any other comments about the show or for our listeners tonight?
9473551	9473631	Um...
9475635	9476376	No, not really.
9476396	9478938	I was going to get a bonus involving my pictures.
9481400	9484342	Alright, well... I've been posting them lately.
9484382	9486144	The picture you just posted here in chat?
9486184	9488145	Hold on, I'm going to take a look here.
9488265	9489707	The pictures I've been posting.
9489927	9490908	Well, that's one of them.
9492609	9492949	Gotcha.
9492969	9494250	Well, then check out the gallery.
9494270	9498614	It looks like you've got a little gallery going on Photobucket and plugging it in our chatroom.
9499154	9499635	So there you go.
9500055	9503318	ROGS68, glad to hear you had fun and we'll hopefully see you next year.
9504986	9506087	Alright, see ya
9529022	9547935	Just looking over what's been happening so far and then all of a sudden I see this little gem of a story right here regarding Battlefield 1943 where apparently it says something about at least 5 million dying in the first day of multiplayer.
9550277	9554240	And then they go as far as saying that they're trying to get up to 48 million kills.
9557577	9560944	And I don't know, I hear Kotaku basically making a fit about it.
9561585	9562788	The fact that it's tasteless.
9563088	9568700	The fact that, you know, playing a World War II game and trying to rack up kills to match the amount in real life.
9571725	9587355	Um, yeah, I mean, comparing it to the real life is a little bit tacky, especially when, you know, video games are supposed to be separated from real life, and a lot of times the justification for these games to be so violent is, well, it's not real life.
9588175	9588736	You know what I mean?
9589576	9598842	Yeah, people just, I mean, I can understand people's rationale regarding, you know, having, regarding something being tasteless, but it's just a game.
9599892	9601733	I mean, what happened already happened.
9602533	9607896	Right, I mean, I'm okay with the game, but the little promotion is a little tacky.
9609016	9609356	Mm-hmm.
9610697	9627065	Besides that, basically staying on the subject of tastelessness, another one where, you know, they're playing a, they have like a flash game, I believe, that recreates Flight 1549, the one that landed on the Hudson earlier this year.
9627305	9627525	Uh-huh.
9628137	9636695	And so they're basically saying, I don't know, it's just on the same subject of being tasteless, though.
9638679	9638959	Well...
9640655	9648356	Yeah, I guess, but at the same time, you know, isn't there someone in the world who's created an art piece out of that?
9648757	9651617	You know, and maybe this is what goes for World War II as well.
9651997	9656638	I mean, I remember Super Combine Massacre RPG getting, like, a lot of flack.
9657398	9666140	Especially, you know, the whole slam dance thing, which pretty much blew up in their face with the fact that they supposedly got censored for that game.
9668362	9679092	And then you see how tastelessness basically goes to the extreme in that sense, where you get censored in a festival that goes against the principles.
9679972	9684597	You know, I guess a lot of it just has to kind of do with your interpretation of it.
9684797	9688400	And that goes with games, that goes with art in general.
9688840	9691803	You know, if you want to be offended by it, you will.
9692203	9694646	But if you won't allow yourself to be offended by it, you won't.
9695976	9701838	I don't know if that makes sense as usual in the world not everybody can be pleased apparently
9702916	9703496	No, sir.
9703996	9705697	Well, anything else on your mind this week, Zaku?
9707197	9723820	Besides DDRX still sucking and just waiting to hopefully, you know, if my local arcade, Chinatown Fair, apparently follows through on what they said they were by replacing every machine with DDRX, then I'll probably see how bad it is.
9724080	9726321	But it's been pretty much dull on that end.
9726889	9727289	Wait, please?
9727309	9729892	Yeah, you gotta love those blanket answers trying to cover their own ass.
9746980	9748100	Take care, Zaku.
9748420	9749480	Thanks for being on the show.
9750061	9751561	Later.
9751581	9752421	1-877-GAME.
9752621	9754921	Do you think he knows that was a reference to his story earlier tonight?
9755201	9757102	I don't think he knows what's going on.
9757122	9758102	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9759022	9762363	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9763743	9767183	We'll take like one more call and then we're going to wrap up for the night.
9767704	9769284	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9769624	9771364	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9771384	9771944	Here comes a call.
9771984	9772924	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9772944	9773284	Who's this?
9774645	9776245	Hi, this is Benjamin Anderson.
9776448	9777788	Hi Spazinator, what's on your mind tonight?
9779609	9780309	Two things.
9781930	9785771	First off, I just want to agree with what you were saying earlier.
9785791	9793293	It seems like a lot of people out there, especially in America, have things half-assed backwards.
9794873	9804516	Whether it be movies or games or whatever, you see people losing limbs, being decapitated, brutally murdered.
9805202	9807270	But God forbid they show a boob.
9807592	9810262	Oh my God, this should go to DEFCON 3.
9810825	9811045	I mean...
9812504	9815567	Well, to be fair, there's a lot of people that don't like the violence either.
9815667	9817730	But yeah, it does seem strange in our culture.
9817930	9832284	And I kind of blame the MPAA at the end of the day because they're the ones that put the more stringent NC-17 ratings on things that are slightly sexual, whereas you can have all these violent movies rated R. I think it needs to go one way or the other.
9832405	9835708	Either we need to get some more fucking tits in an R-rated movie or...
9836388	9839931	and that was fuck and tits, not some fucking tits, although you can get those too.
9840371	9847035	But we need that in an R-rated movie, or we need these extremely violent movies to be rated NC-17.
9847295	9848976	Give them the kiss of death rating as well.
9849317	9850918	I think you need to go one way or the other.
9851458	9852379	It's getting ridiculous.
9854140	9864727	Yeah, well, the thing is, not to get all political and whatnot, plus I don't totally remember my history lessons, but I think...
9865891	9881534	At least in part, the country was founded by ultra-conservative Puritans, like the Pilgrims, wearing the buckles on their shoes and whatnot.
9881894	9882434	Burn the witch!
9882454	9883175	They're a witch!
9883595	9884115	Burn the witch!
9885915	9886675	Yeah, exactly.
9887735	9888476	No, they were...
9891395	9898264	If I remember my history, they even made plays illegal because they considered it a form of lying.
9898465	9903972	They considered anything involving the body dirty and wrong and all that.
9904528	9907309	Unfortunately, we really haven't gone beyond that
9928055	9947043	and like I can sit here on the internet and say fuck, shit, cock, piss, boobs I can say all of that you know and that's a great thing about freedom of speech which sadly not everyone in this world has but the thing is that we have these governing bodies that put labels on things that are broken and need to be modernized
9947543	9956246	And the greatest, I mean, the biggest opinion I always use, or I should say example I always use, is a movie that came out in 1997, 1998.
9957187	9958307	One of my favorite movies ever.
9958327	9960188	It's called Romeo and Michelle's High School Reunion.
9960688	9965750	It's an innocent movie with Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino about these chicks that go to their 10-year high school reunion.
9966110	9969452	And there's a couple sex jokes and they say the word fuck a few times.
9969792	9972193	The movie is rated R. And why?
9972853	9974454	Why is a movie like that rated R?
9974534	9976355	It's practically cartoony in nature.
9976795	9979997	I would let a 13, 14-year-old watch this movie, no problem.
9980357	9989101	Any kid that's old enough to know about sex, I would much rather have them watching this movie on repeat every day for a summer than watching The Terminator.
9989422	9989962	I really would.
9993644	9997526	Some of these things we have in our culture really need to be modernized.
9997686	9998026	That's all.
9999881	10029049	Yeah, I agree with you, but also at the same time, I think even you mentioned this time and time before, you know, video games have really been around for, what, 35, 40 years, whereas, like, movies have been around since, what, early, you know, 1900s, you know, there's, you know, people, you know, even, like, grandparents of the age have been going out watching movies, whereas, you know, well,
10030000	10034763	Video games have always been, what, our generation and the younger kids.
10035163	10046169	And there's that kind of disconnect where the older generation think of video games as these kind of toys, toys of the kids.
10046729	10049851	If something is cursing or violence or swearing it,
10050376	10051858	Oh my god, no.
10051878	10054480	This could be the worst thing ever.
10054560	10056141	It's going to be a downfall of Western civilization.
10056161	10057122	And don't even quote me on that.
10057142	10058083	Earlier than that.
10076740	10081262	Well, I don't plan to profess to be a cinema expert, but it was very taboo.
10081362	10083802	Even if the boobies showed up, it was extremely taboo.
10084162	10087744	Just like seeing a blowjob in a movie is this day and age.
10088624	10090084	Video games, I think, just have a way to go.
10090344	10091805	But we need to wrap up.
10091845	10093626	Spazinator, did you have anything else you wanted to share with us?
10095346	10097407	Well, I just want to add one more point.
10097827	10101128	Conversely, even though boobs are relatively new,
10102577	10107084	There's movies out there that a century ago would have been acceptable.
10107165	10110210	They're not acceptable now like Force Over Nation.
10110711	10111171	It came out in 1915.
10111212	10111332	It was...
10113343	10114905	TKK Movie
10137825	10139047	Society kind of evolves.
10139147	10141531	But it just seems like with video games, it's evolving slower.
10141791	10142412	And I don't get that.
10142893	10144775	But Spazinator, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.
10144795	10145416	We appreciate it.
10145657	10146458	Have a good one, buddy, okay?
10147659	10148240	Yep, you too.
10148320	10148620	Bye-bye.
10192034	10193555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10212930	10217494	with his Don't Copy That 2, and apparently... Really?
10217634	10219035	I thought that shit was from the 80s.
10219856	10231425	Seriously, he's from the 80s, and basically, based on the little video teaser he has, it looks like if you copy stuff off the internet, well, your parents will be dragged out in the street and beaten to death.
10233247	10237911	Sounds pretty accurate to me, but... Yes, awesome.
10238854	10240075	Hold on, I gotta look at this here.
10240115	10240455	Hold on.
10240715	10242216	We have a little preview here.
10242636	10243637	Let's see if I can fast forward.
10249240	10250700	Oh, this is like a preview or something.
10250740	10251121	No, no, no, no.
10251141	10251981	They go through the songs.
10252001	10253242	Give me a second.
10253482	10254803	I gotta fast forward then, I guess.
10255283	10256804	No, it's right here.
10257764	10259185	It's not just a copy, it's a crime.
10259245	10260526	It's not just a copy, it's a crime.
10260546	10262046	It's not just a copy, it's a crime.
10262066	10263747	It's not just a copy, it's a crime.
10268686	10269067	Wow.
10269808	10270609	Fucking joke.
10271791	10272392	Interesting.
10272533	10274115	You missed the beginning part of it.
10274216	10275277	It doesn't just sound like that.
10275478	10276039	Ah, whatever.
10276059	10277301	Yeah, I'm okay.
10278880	10279721	Walk It Out Walk It Out
10308628	10309028	Nice.
10310208	10310648	Yeah.
10311869	10312589	Seriously?
10313349	10313769	Really?
10314769	10315629	Walking outdoors?
10315990	10319510	But apparently it is a rhythm game, so you know, you have to step to the beat.
10319550	10320710	So there is a game in it.
10320750	10324011	There is a game to it, but it's walking outdoors.
10325391	10325832	Come on.
10326612	10326912	Really?
10328112	10329192	I do that for school credit.
10329732	10331653	You play the game going to buy the game.
10334473	10334753	Anyways.
10335033	10337094	On my YouTube project this week, we went outdoors.
10337114	10337994	It was a lot of fun, actually.
10340233	10344965	Myst will be coming to the PlayStation Network for PSP July 16th.
10345646	10346528	And that's kind of neat.
10349867	10350427	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10377722	10381644	We'll have a single player campaign as well as a four player co-op campaign.
10382024	10382785	That's awesome.
10383665	10385266	Nice, we'll have a $200 controller too.
10385306	10386447	That's optional.
10387187	10387748	Remember that?
10387888	10388848	They never had that.
10388948	10389709	That was something else.
10390349	10391390	That was a mech game, wasn't it?
10391490	10393191	It was a mech game, but it's not this mech game.
10393211	10395112	I know it's not that mech game, but it was some other game.
10396018	10405946	Also, Smith & Tinker has authorized MechTech to distribute MechWarrior 4 along with its expansions for free on the internet.
10405966	10406707	Thank you, Chatters.
10406727	10407667	GS68, Steel Battalion.
10407708	10408848	That was the game I was trying to think of.
10410370	10410910	On the internet.
10410950	10415994	So you'll actually be able to play MechWarrior 4 for free on Battletech.com soon enough.
10417375	10418796	You know what we need in this world?
10419417	10420217	Real mechs.
10420237	10420858	Yes.
10421331	10422031	That's what we need.
10422291	10428333	How much would you pay to go to a place that was like an arena where nobody would really get hurt or really get blown up?
10428353	10429633	It would be like laser tag, all right?
10429933	10433694	But you would have real mechs that you would crawl into and get in.
10433794	10434814	You mean robot jocks?
10435034	10438055	Something like that, where you would actually crawl in these giant machines.
10438535	10440195	And I'm not talking about the shit at Dave & Buster's.
10440515	10446797	You would actually walk around a giant arena outside with, like, you know, like bales of hay, obstacles, and stuff like that.
10446817	10448517	Dude, the thing at Dave & Buster's was sweet.
10448917	10449698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10472457	10476119	Jason in chat says, they have real mechs.
10476159	10478360	There was a real Gundam in Japan, life-size.
10479021	10481022	Yeah, they actually do have one.
10481102	10487585	And they were also working on, they did a Gigantor in another town.
10488186	10490047	The Gundam was outside Tokyo.
10490527	10492048	The mere thought gives me a semi.
10493308	10496190	Carcassones coming to DS.
10497472	10498192	That's kind of neat.
10499233	10499833	That game's fun.
10500453	10505295	Really, it needs to be some other game.
10506976	10507296	Oh, great.
10507936	10509016	I totally forgot the name of the game.
10509036	10509416	The Other?
10509897	10520521	The Other game that's similar to this game that's also another board game turned Xbox Live Arcade game that I can't remember, but I played a lot of and played a lot of the board game and just...
10522533	10523595	What was the other one?
10523615	10524296	I can't even remember, too.
10524316	10528442	There was Carcassonne and there was... God, there was all the expansions for it, too.
10528542	10529724	Somebody in chat will yell it out.
10529764	10530265	Catan.
10530505	10531446	Settlers of Catan.
10531506	10531867	Thank you.
10532007	10532408	Thank you.
10532488	10533529	That's what needs to be on there.
10534451	10536694	And I need memory in my brain.
10538222	10542148	Also, the PlayStation Network will be getting manga as well.
10543129	10544992	They're actually going to get some downloadable comics.
10545393	10549058	Of course, this has only been announced for the Japanese markets, but why not?
10549358	10551001	You know what?
10551381	10551862	Neat idea.
10552142	10553264	I actually think that's a neat idea.
10554505	10555906	It's a little weird, but why not?
10555946	10558327	We have these Amazon e-reader books.
10558468	10560349	Why not manga on your PSP?
10560569	10560829	Why not?
10560989	10561769	Yeah, that'd be cool.
10562010	10563550	Didn't we see some of this, actually?
10563691	10569914	I thought there were some games that came out not that long ago that were kind of like this, like $20 comic books on the PSP.
10569994	10571755	Yeah, you're talking about the Metal Gear Solid motion comics.
10571775	10572856	Yeah, remember that?
10573196	10573356	Yeah.
10573416	10574217	Those are, yeah.
10574337	10574997	I mean, why not?
10576527	10584453	There is a brand new mod for Half-Life 2, Neo Tokyo, which is actually, I believe, like a Tolkien version of the game.
10585014	10594681	It's been released for the Source software development kit, and I think it will be available on Steam.
10595401	10596402	And it's actually...
10597683	10599364	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10621802	10630307	Also, I think a while back we saw there was a graffiti type device created using the Wii Remote.
10631168	10639053	Sort of using similar things as the John Cho stuff where he created the virtual light boards.
10640514	10646198	Well, now you have the interactive white board thing using a Wii spray can.
10646798	10649740	And actually apparently won a design prize.
10651842	10653923	In Germany, which is pretty cool.
10654624	10664752	And I guess held by the German firm International Forum Design, WeSpray was one of the 377 finalists of the prestigious award.
10665693	10668515	That's a lot of finalists, but okay.
10670051	10684454	Um, and then finally, um, Medal of Honor Heroes is the latest game on the PSP to be exploited to, uh, enable custom firmware and homebrew.
10684954	10686215	And yes, this also works.
10686795	10689715	Um, they've been, actually, they've tested it on the PSP-1000.
10689775	10691336	I think it also works on the 3000.
10692656	10697357	But, once again, going back to the beginning of the show and discussion about, you know,
10698697	10706148	you know countermeasures for piracy and that type of thing no matter how hard you try there's someone always trying harder so that goes for both sides
10708192	10710113	Alright, a little lesson learned on tonight's show.
10710353	10710814	There you go.
10711674	10712215	The more you know.
10712415	10713635	Yes, indeed, the more you know.
10714076	10717658	Alright, well, I guess that's going to wrap it up for tonight's show.
10717998	10721720	And before we say goodnight, though, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10722141	10726103	So, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight as you enjoy The Sims 3 for the rest of the evening.
10726243	10727864	I'm spray painting sand.
10728285	10729205	That's that noise I hear.
10730006	10731386	What color are you spraying sand?
10731667	10733868	I'm actually turning the ground into sand.
10733988	10735229	I'm using the terrain paints.
10737029	10741773	My final thought is I'm actually kind of craving Del Taco and I'm hoping the one in Rockland is open late.
10742613	10743854	So I'm driving out there tonight.
10743954	10745756	So I want Del Taco.
10746376	10747117	Mmm, Del Taco.
10747617	10748358	Loki, your final thought.
10750039	10754202	My final thought is I need to play more games this week.
10754322	10759005	But, you know, in the absence of playing games, I've been unpacking and I'm almost done.
10759866	10760166	Alrighty.
