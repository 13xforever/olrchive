00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, July 19th, 2009, Dragon Quest IX might get DLC as it sells oodles of copies.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.520
Could your mall soon get a Microsoft Store next to the Apple Store?

00:23.520 --> 00:29.760
And Capcom finally admits something we've always known about Street Fighter IV.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.760
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.760 --> 00:41.760
We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.760 --> 00:47.760
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me every week are the awesome co-hosts that help make up OLR with me,

00:47.760 --> 00:49.760
the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.760
Greetings and salutations.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.760
How are you, Miss Summers?

00:53.760 --> 00:55.760
In pain. Lots of it.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.760
Me too this week. I know you've got your hand thing going on, but oh my god.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.760
But Vicodin makes it better.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.760
Vicodin does make it better. I wish Vicodin made heat stroke better.

01:02.760 --> 01:09.760
Vicodin, however, means I cannot drink the delicious bottle of wine that's sitting on my counter in the kitchen.

01:09.760 --> 01:14.760
But I can! No, it'll make my heat thing worse. I'll explain that in a minute.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.760
Well, you're welcome to as much lemonade as you like.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.760
I appreciate that. Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

01:19.760 --> 01:20.760
Hello.

01:20.760 --> 01:21.760
How are you doing, Loki?

01:21.760 --> 01:22.760
Fine.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.760
Excellent. And how are you holding up in the heat?

01:24.760 --> 01:29.760
Are you a healthy individual this week? Have you been sick at all? Have any surgeries we need to know about?

01:29.760 --> 01:30.760
I got a little sunburned.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.760
I was going to say, you look a little sunburned on your arm. Did you go out shooting guns again today?

01:34.760 --> 01:41.760
No, I had to go. As part of my company crap, I was too lazy to say no,

01:41.760 --> 01:46.760
so I had to go volunteer at this place called the Grace Foundation.

01:46.760 --> 01:50.760
They rescue horses and stuff, and I had to go stay in a fence.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.760
Wait, wait, wait. You volunteered for horses this week?

01:53.760 --> 02:02.760
No, what it is, is I forgot to say no to volunteering, you know, painting fences in 100 degree weather by the way, you know.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.760
That's awfully kind of you, though. You're a good person.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.760
Dark Soccer's offering aloe vera.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.760
Oh, I don't need that.

02:08.760 --> 02:12.760
You know what? I have some aloe vera at home that's awesome because it's from Canada,

02:12.760 --> 02:17.760
and they have different drugs up there that you can get at the drug store you can't get here because Canadians rock.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.760
Love you, Canada.

02:18.760 --> 02:23.760
But they have this aloe vera gel that comes with lidocaine in it, which is the same stuff that dentists will use to numb your teeth.

02:23.760 --> 02:24.760
Cool.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.760
It's like prescription strength over here.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.760
You can also get it with benzocaine, though.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.760
It's true.

02:29.760 --> 02:30.760
It's my arm's red. That's it.

02:30.760 --> 02:37.760
Alright. Anyhow, moving on to the show tonight. Yeah, it's 108 degrees here in Sacramento where we tape our show.

02:37.760 --> 02:43.760
Now, Dark Soccer's little room that we tape the show in is pretty nice. I mean, it's not like it's 108 degrees in here.

02:43.760 --> 02:49.760
But, man, you take one step outside, you feel like you're going to just die, just melt like the Wicked Witch of the West.

02:49.760 --> 02:56.760
I've been going outside today because I've taken it upon myself to cleanse the throne of Shermie.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.760
Not the one that's under the desk, by the way.

02:59.760 --> 03:09.760
She has a very large cat box, and we keep it in a closet in the bathroom when the bottom of the door is sawed off so that Shermie has her own private area.

03:09.760 --> 03:14.760
Well, four years of concentrated cat can create a bit of a stink.

03:14.760 --> 03:24.760
So the box is getting sterilized. It's sitting outside with that green spray on it in the front yard on the porch.

03:24.760 --> 03:29.760
And I got on my hands and knees and scrubbed out the bottom of the closet.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.760
And Shermie's bathroom is freaking clean.

03:32.760 --> 03:33.760
Well, congrats.

03:33.760 --> 03:38.760
But I've had to go out and spray down her big old litter box today.

03:38.760 --> 03:45.760
To answer some questions from chat, and of course we always have the fourth guest on our show, the chat room, chat.orangelaundryday.com.

03:45.760 --> 03:50.760
Fear of the Claw starts off with, what's the Vicodin for? Why is Jamie on it? I missed a couple episodes.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.760
She had hand surgery, right?

03:52.760 --> 03:56.760
Yeah, I had trigger finger release surgery.

03:56.760 --> 04:03.760
So if you want to, I'm not going to explain it again, if you guys want to know what it is, it's online on many, many websites.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.760
And I think she explained it a couple episodes back.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.760
I'll put something in the chat room.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.760
The podcast is lagging an episode behind, which is totally my fault.

04:10.760 --> 04:14.760
Like a dummy, I ran out of here last week and left the USB drive in the computer.

04:14.760 --> 04:19.760
And I never had a chance to get back home, or come back over here and grab the USB drive.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.760
Because Jamie lives a good 30 minutes from me, get the USB stick and upload the show.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.760
So hopefully last week's show will finally hit the podcast feed tonight.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.760
And I apologize, I know people miss it when we don't get the show up on time.

04:29.760 --> 04:35.760
But I wasn't home. I have not slept in my own bed since Wednesday night.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.760
That's how on the go I've been lately, which, you know, I can't complain.

04:39.760 --> 04:43.760
Life is good, but just busy, busy, busy with all my different commitments.

04:43.760 --> 04:51.760
So, anyhow, let's see, moving on, looking at chat comments, commenting on the temperature.

04:51.760 --> 04:55.760
I'm also about to post the link for what trigger finger release surgery is.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.760
There you go, if you want to educate yourself.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.760
Alright, well let's get into our game of weeks.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
Wow, I found a video of it.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.760
Ew, don't, see here's the thing, I do not do well with blood squeamishness.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.760
You know what's actually really funny?

05:06.760 --> 05:13.760
Like, I don't mind Mortal Kombat type of games or Trauma Center or all the fake cartoon blood.

05:13.760 --> 05:18.760
I have a very good mind that can distinguish, you know, as I'm sure a lot of you do,

05:18.760 --> 05:20.760
that can distinguish fake blood from real blood.

05:20.760 --> 05:25.760
Even horror movies, even though I've gone into a rant on this show before,

05:25.760 --> 05:27.760
I don't want to get into it again, but you know I hate the Saw movies,

05:27.760 --> 05:29.760
and a lot of that has to do with the violence.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.760
It's not that the violence makes me ill,

05:31.760 --> 05:36.760
but okay, that kind of violence is, you know, I can handle all that stuff fine.

05:36.760 --> 05:41.760
It's real blood and the real cuts that I see in people's hands.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.760
Like Jamie tried to show me the scar from her surgery, which you know is cool,

05:45.760 --> 05:47.760
and I realize there's a lot of people that, you know,

05:47.760 --> 05:50.760
are the types of people that will watch real trauma in the ER and Discovery Channel and all that.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.760
They're like, cool, surgeries.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.760
I want to barf when I see that kind of stuff.

05:55.760 --> 05:56.760
Mine wasn't that bad.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.760
But for me, like, I just get really grossed out by blood and cuts and everything.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.760
I'm very proud of you then for looking at the one that I did myself.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.760
Well, thank you, but still, I just wanted to barf.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.760
You remember when that exhibit was coming through town?

06:08.760 --> 06:09.760
I wanted to go to that.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.760
The bodies revealed that they were advertising on the radio for like six months.

06:13.760 --> 06:18.760
This is basically all these corpses that they've opened up so you can see everything.

06:18.760 --> 06:19.760
No, it's actually really cool because what they've done,

06:19.760 --> 06:25.760
they've actually set them in everyday poses like in office positions or in play positions

06:25.760 --> 06:27.760
so that you could see the way that the muscles.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.760
But they're people.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.760
They donated themselves, however.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.760
I don't think that they knew they were going to be donated for an exhibit.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.760
I know.

06:37.760 --> 06:38.760
I can't deal with it.

06:38.760 --> 06:44.760
They're donated for scientific research, and I think, well, as a massage therapist,

06:44.760 --> 06:51.760
I wanted to see it because for, now, I'll tell you the biggest thing that got me over my gross factor with bodies

06:51.760 --> 06:54.760
is watching cadaver videos.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.760
And once you see muscles moving on their own, it's sort of.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.760
I'm going to barf.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.760
I'm sorry.

07:02.760 --> 07:03.760
Just not the type of stuff I'm into.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.760
Puppies, kittens.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.760
Yay, kittens.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.760
I love kittens.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.760
Yay.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.760
Laying inside the corpses of the dead.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.760
I hate you.

07:12.760 --> 07:13.760
But yeah, I don't get.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.760
Video games, Mortal Kombat, ripping heads off, hee hee, funny.

07:16.760 --> 07:17.760
I love that shit.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.760
It's the real stuff.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.760
My brain can totally tell the difference.

07:21.760 --> 07:22.760
Fake blood in movies I hate.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.760
Other people's blood I hate.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.760
My own, I have no freaking problem with it.

07:26.760 --> 07:27.760
Oh, even my own.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.760
He would not let me watch my surgery, but he did let me watch them do the anesthetic.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
Hey, Jeremy.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.760
It took me a lot to look at the pictures of what it looked like,

07:36.760 --> 07:39.760
because they showed me a picture of my gallbladder before and after.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.760
Like, they actually put the laparoscopic camera in there when I had my surgery last October.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.760
They actually showed the pictures of what my inside looked like with and without it.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.760
It took me like four days before I was ready to look at that picture.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.760
And then when I finally did, I was like, I looked at it,

07:52.760 --> 07:56.760
and then I kind of like cocked my head to the side like a kitten looking at the TV or something

07:56.760 --> 07:58.760
and then looked at it for about ten more seconds and I was like,

07:58.760 --> 08:00.760
oh my god, I'm going to barf.

08:00.760 --> 08:01.760
Hey, Jeremy.

08:01.760 --> 08:02.760
I never looked at it again.

08:02.760 --> 08:03.760
It's gross.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.760
Jeremy would not say anything for everybody, by the way.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.760
She's a little Mike shy today.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.760
She also needs a bath.

08:08.760 --> 08:12.760
Anyhow, I don't want to talk anymore about internal body organs and stuff like that,

08:12.760 --> 08:18.760
unless it's in a video games, which, by the way, it just blows my mind.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.760
You know, when I hear this stuff about he who shall not be named,

08:21.760 --> 08:26.760
you know, Jack Voldemort, the once lawyer from Florida who is, you know, a total attention whore.

08:26.760 --> 08:27.760
The freaking loser.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.760
Who, yeah, always talks about, you know, how video games lead to real violence.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.760
I'm like, can't people tell the difference?

08:33.760 --> 08:36.760
I really don't have a problem being able to distinguish the two.

08:36.760 --> 08:41.760
I have a physical reaction to the real stuff as compared to the fake stuff.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.760
Are you telling me a lot of people don't have that?

08:43.760 --> 08:44.760
I didn't see that episode of bullshit.

08:44.760 --> 08:45.760
I know. I heard about it.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.760
It's up on YouTube apparently.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.760
Oh my god.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.760
I'm going to have to watch that because I love bullshit.

08:48.760 --> 08:53.760
They actually did one debunking the video game violence myth.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.760
Like, you know, we haven't already.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.760
Am I crazy?

08:56.760 --> 08:59.760
Is there anyone in chat like me, because I see a lot of people going,

08:59.760 --> 09:03.760
oh, I went to that exhibit or, oh, cool, I think those exhibits are neat

09:03.760 --> 09:05.760
or I couldn't believe that they were real people.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.760
Is anyone like me or am I just a big pussy?

09:08.760 --> 09:10.760
That's fine. I can admit it.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.760
It's really nothing.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.760
There's a lot of people who have that problem.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.760
I mean, it's just the way you're wired.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.760
I didn't know that exhibit was there, otherwise I probably would have gone.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.760
I really wanted to go. I just couldn't afford it at the time.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.760
Actually, no, I wouldn't have wanted to go because it's an art exhibit

09:25.760 --> 09:27.760
and that's just, I don't know.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.760
If they could bring the exhibit to me, then maybe.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.760
Yay, I hear Golden Anthros has me, Sky.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.760
Good, I'm not alone. Thank you.

09:33.760 --> 09:34.760
By the way.

09:34.760 --> 09:35.760
What?

09:35.760 --> 09:37.760
My brother Phillip has now added me on Facebook.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.760
My mother and my stepfather have added me on Facebook.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.760
Why is my family suddenly becoming technologically with the times?

09:44.760 --> 09:47.760
I need to figure out how to set up those filters on Facebook

09:47.760 --> 09:49.760
because I'm getting more and more co-workers on Facebook,

09:49.760 --> 09:52.760
which, you know, just my work life is very different from my personal life.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.760
It's nothing personal, it's just.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.760
Don't worry.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.760
Facebook will eventually be phased out or replaced by something else that's grander.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.760
I'm sure.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.760
Soon enough, it'll happen and everybody won't realize it until, you know,

10:03.760 --> 10:06.760
the news reports on it, like, retarded people.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.760
Technically, he didn't add me. He actually came up as a suggestion.

10:09.760 --> 10:14.760
But my mom, my uncle, and my stepfather have added me all on Facebook.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.760
Wow.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.760
So my mom actually now knows that I am just as potty-mouthed as she is.

10:19.760 --> 10:20.760
You know I'm probably potty-mouthed.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.760
Completely off topic here.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.760
Oh, what else is new here on Orange Laundry?

10:24.760 --> 10:31.760
No, well, it's on the show. It's about the show, but not necessarily on topic with corpses and...

10:31.760 --> 10:33.760
That's fine. Let's move on.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.760
As you can see, I found a hard drive lying around the other day.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.760
And I decided to look on it.

10:40.760 --> 10:46.760
I think it was the old hard drive out of my computer that was, you know, the arcade cabinet.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.760
But it had some of the old shows on it from I don't know when.

10:49.760 --> 10:53.760
I didn't even listen to any of them, but they're older shows.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.760
Really?

10:54.760 --> 10:58.760
Do you have, like, it might be the drive that we used to have that had, like,

10:58.760 --> 11:00.760
Episode 1 and all the really old shows on it.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.760
It might be that drive.

11:01.760 --> 11:02.760
They weren't even numbered. They just had dates on them.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.760
Those are the old shows. Dude, that's the drive that has Episode 1 on it.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.760
Yeah, it was still good.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.760
Holy crap! Hook that drive up. Can you get me a backup of what's on that drive?

11:09.760 --> 11:11.760
Well, I already backed it all up to my computer.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.760
Can you get me a... can you bring me a DVD of the files?

11:14.760 --> 11:18.760
Because we've had the listeners, like, begging for Episode 1 for, like, years.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.760
God, that's why I had to pick a bad migraine.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.760
That was before... because we didn't think the show was going to last a year back then.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.760
So we just labeled them all with the actual dates.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.760
We didn't start numbering them until, like, Episode 40 or something.

11:29.760 --> 11:30.760
Yeah, so that's why I have...

11:30.760 --> 11:31.760
Holy crap!

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
I don't know if it's, you know, the first ones.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.760
I just, you know, I... there's no year on it, so I was like, eh, I don't know when these are from.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.760
It's... dude, it's the first year of the show.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.760
Oh, okay.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.760
Well, you need to put that stuff up in the archive that we have online.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.760
I also found all my MAME ROMs on there. I was like, sweet!

11:45.760 --> 11:51.760
Nice. Well, cool. Hook up that drive. Let's make sure... before we get the listeners too excited, let's...

11:51.760 --> 11:53.760
It completely works, too. I don't know why it stopped working on yours.

11:53.760 --> 11:54.760
That's awesome.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.760
But it works... it is partitioned, like, six times, though. It's kind of weird.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.760
Sweet.

11:58.760 --> 12:02.760
Alright, well, we'll hook that up, guys. Everybody in chat's going, yay!

12:02.760 --> 12:03.760
Alright.

12:03.760 --> 12:07.760
I tell you, we need to do the big DVD.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.760
I know. Now we can, with all the old stuff.

12:09.760 --> 12:14.760
Anyway, let's move on to this week's news and what's happening now seven years later since those shows that Loki found.

12:14.760 --> 12:15.760
What have we been playing, also?

12:15.760 --> 12:16.760
That's right, our gaming week.

12:16.760 --> 12:17.760
Yes.

12:17.760 --> 12:18.760
Yes.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.760
So, Dark Sakura, start us out. Loki's, like, excited to talk about something, I think.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.760
No, I'm not. I haven't done any.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.760
Okay, Dark Sakura, what have you been playing this week?

12:26.760 --> 12:29.760
A lot of Sims 3, because that's really all I can play.

12:29.760 --> 12:39.760
And the fortunate thing is that my mouse is one of the thumb track balls, so it keeps my hand in a neutral position, and it doesn't really hurt so much, so I've been playing a lot of that.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.760
I tried playing some pinball, but, yeah, that didn't quite work.

12:44.760 --> 13:00.760
Also, I downloaded Loom last week on Steam, and I was gonna play that, and I loaded it up, and then I was like, oh, wait, I have to do stuff, so I didn't play it, but I do have it now.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.760
That's really about it. What did you do?

13:03.760 --> 13:08.760
This week, I played Grand Theft Auto 4, the modified version that I'm still playing.

13:08.760 --> 13:21.760
I finally got it down to the point where we tweaked a few more things, and we're at a point where we can kind of stop messing with it for a while, until I find something really cool to do with it.

13:21.760 --> 13:27.760
But, yeah, it's been pretty fun. Very crazy. You're probably pissing a lot of people off because I keep winning.

13:27.760 --> 13:37.760
But that's not on purpose. I mean, it's just, I've adapted to the new weapons pretty quick, and they forget that some of the weapons explode on contact with helicopters or flying cars.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.760
And, you know, different strategies and whatnot.

13:41.760 --> 13:52.760
But it's actually been pretty fun, and like I said, I think last week I'm planning on filming it, and I finally found all my video capture stuff, so I will actually try it.

13:52.760 --> 14:01.760
The only thing I have to see is if my laptop will actually take that video capture stuff, because my laptop's relatively new, but not new enough for me.

14:01.760 --> 14:07.760
It's not dual core or anything, so I have to see if it will actually be able to keep up with it.

14:07.760 --> 14:14.760
Plus, I found some other device that will actually capture in HD, which is pretty cool, so maybe I'll have to pick that up later on.

14:14.760 --> 14:25.760
But, yeah, that's really all I played. I have a bunch of stuff sitting around like I should have been playing, but I've been busy working on the house and working on other things.

14:25.760 --> 14:31.760
But, yeah, it's basically Grand Theft Auto is the only thing I had time for.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.760
Alright.

14:32.760 --> 14:36.760
Oh, I watched Jim play RPG Maker 3, which is kind of funny.

14:36.760 --> 14:43.760
Oh, yeah, that's right. I saw the RPG Maker 3 on PlayStation 2. That game seems very intricate for a PlayStation 2 game.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.760
There's a lot that you can do with it.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.760
You should have seen the old RPG Makers SNES ones.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.760
I'm surprised they don't have a new one out on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

14:52.760 --> 14:53.760
They aren't that popular.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.760
Sadly enough, they didn't sell well.

14:55.760 --> 15:02.760
I remember selling RPG Maker 3, and I thought, oh my god, this is fucking awesome, but no one seemed to get it.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.760
No one really likes to do anything they actually have to work at.

15:04.760 --> 15:05.760
It's a very cult kind of game.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.760
It is tough, and especially with, like, it's not...

15:08.760 --> 15:14.760
I like to say, like, ZZT would be pretty awesome, but ZZT, the only difference between that and like this,

15:14.760 --> 15:19.760
ZZT's game actually was pretty good, you know, the standalone game that came with it.

15:19.760 --> 15:26.760
You know, it didn't really show you how to make levels and stuff like that, but it kind of, you could, you know, look at it and stuff.

15:26.760 --> 15:32.760
But, you know, that also had a really powerful editor with it, whereas RPG Maker 3, they have a really crappy game that's with it.

15:32.760 --> 15:36.760
It's not very polished. It's just kind of, hey, look, here's what you can do with the engine. Done.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.760
Wouldn't you expect, though, that somebody's going to bring in RPG Maker, especially the PlayStation 3?

15:40.760 --> 15:42.760
Because look at, you've got your little big planet.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.760
You've got your motor. What's the kart racing game that's coming out on PlayStation 3?

15:46.760 --> 15:47.760
Mod Nation.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.760
Mod Nation. Thank you.

15:48.760 --> 15:54.760
If you had these kind of games coming out that are about creating and sharing a community, wouldn't it seem logical that a role-playing game's going to come out at some point?

15:54.760 --> 15:58.760
They should. It would be cool. But they probably won't.

15:58.760 --> 16:04.760
Because it really, I mean, they've had a few of them come out in Japan and they just haven't really taken off.

16:04.760 --> 16:08.760
And even the company that used to make them on PC, like, went out of business.

16:08.760 --> 16:17.760
And now it's being kind of carried on with, like, people modding the, you know, actual files and doing, like, freeware updates and stuff like that.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.760
All right. Well, is that it for your gaming week?

16:18.760 --> 16:19.760
Yep.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.760
Actually, funny enough, most of my gaming this week has been on the Wii.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.760
I've played two new games on the Wii this week.

16:25.760 --> 16:30.760
First off was a download title that I checked out on Monday called BitBoy was the name of the game.

16:30.760 --> 16:42.760
What a cool concept BitBoy has is that you kind of play this game that traverses through an Atari 2600-style game through a Nintendo-style game to a Super Nintendo game.

16:42.760 --> 16:48.760
Then it's, like, more of like a PlayStation or Saturn kind of game, which is weird because there was no Nintendo system right there.

16:48.760 --> 16:56.760
And then a 64-bit game, like Nintendo 64, all the way to a 128-bit game, which is, I guess, their Nintendo Wii version.

16:56.760 --> 17:03.760
And it's kind of like you play the 4-bit game until you, you know, beat it.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.760
And then you get upgraded to the 8-bit game, which you play through.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.760
Kind of a neat concept, and that's what sold me on the game, is I was like, oh, it's cool.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.760
You can kind of move from one, you know, type of game to the other.

17:12.760 --> 17:13.760
It sounds like a lot of fun.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.760
It does, doesn't it? Here's the thing. The game sucks.

17:16.760 --> 17:20.760
There's no nice way to say this. This game is horrible.

17:20.760 --> 17:29.760
And I feel really bad saying that because I'm sure this was created by an independent developer studio and some of these people took a lot of time and put energy into this game.

17:29.760 --> 17:36.760
But it's not worth your money because I think somewhere they got lost in the concept.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.760
It's very clear that this game was very proud of its concept.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.760
And it should be. It doesn't, like, we're all sitting here going, oh, it sounds like a cool game.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.760
And that's what really sold me on buying the game.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.760
And it's a good thing Nintendo Wii doesn't have demos or I probably would have figured that out a lot sooner.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.760
Huh, got me.

17:51.760 --> 17:59.760
But the game itself is this just bad Pac-Man rip-off where you, and I shouldn't say rip-off.

17:59.760 --> 18:05.760
It's not a rip-off, but it's a Pac-Man-ish type of game where you move through a maze and you collect, you know,

18:05.760 --> 18:13.760
I think they're supposed to be mini cubes or, you know, cube friends or something that are hidden throughout the maze and you avoid these monsters.

18:13.760 --> 18:24.760
And then once you get past the Atari version of the game and the later versions of the game, you can press a button and it makes a little weapon so that it knocks out the monsters near you that you can use, like, five times throughout the course of the game.

18:24.760 --> 18:30.760
Well, here's the thing. The game in the 4-bit version doesn't change by the time you get to the 128-bit version.

18:30.760 --> 18:36.760
You're still playing the same damn game where you're moving throughout a maze trying to get the little cubes and avoid the monsters.

18:36.760 --> 18:41.760
And it's just completely unimaginative when you get from the 4-bit to the Super Game.

18:41.760 --> 18:52.760
I really think that they should do something where you're playing through different styles of games because the different genres evolve, you know, as...

18:52.760 --> 18:58.760
Bingo. You hit the jackpot on that one because that's exactly what the problem with this game is.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.760
Copyright Orange Zones Radio.

18:59.760 --> 19:07.760
The genre didn't evolve at all in this game. I mean, and, you know, some might argue with me as I even tried, like, looking on the website, kind of seeing, like, who's in this game and stuff.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.760
And the game definitely has its fans who are not responding well to the negative reviews out there on the internet saying,

19:11.760 --> 19:20.760
Well, it's a game about competing for points and it's all this, you know, the game does evolve because in the Wii version you can flick the Wiimote to jump or something.

19:20.760 --> 19:29.760
And no, I'm sorry. They're just dumb little frills to try and distinguish, you know, one genre to another. It doesn't work.

19:29.760 --> 19:43.760
It didn't really innovate the game. It still is this really shoddy looking cube graphic moving around a shoddy looking cube maze that is the exact same type of maze that was in the 4-bit version just now presented in fancy 3D.

19:43.760 --> 19:54.760
It's just not a good game. I'm sorry. If the 4-bit version had been the way it is, that's fine. But the problem is that as the game evolves, the game doesn't evolve.

19:54.760 --> 20:03.760
And you can tell that they love the idea because they really show off, Oh, well, in the Super Nintendo version of this game you're going to have Mode 7 graphics.

20:03.760 --> 20:10.760
I think you see Mode 7 graphics once and it's kind of like nothing of importance, like the zoom in and out.

20:10.760 --> 20:18.760
The 32-bit version of the game has long load times, so you actually have to sit there between each level and wait for the game to load.

20:18.760 --> 20:26.760
When you know damn well it's not loading anything. It's just a little, ha ha ha, isn't that funny? I remember loading times.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.760
So it's novel, the game?

20:28.760 --> 20:37.760
Basically, it's like, gee, weren't the 80s cool? Was that Goat Boy on Saturday Night Live? Weren't the 80s cool? It's like this.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.760
No, we had bad hair and a flock of seagulls.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.760
That's basically what it is.

20:42.760 --> 20:57.760
So, unfortunately, Bit Boy, the game, not a fan. I'm sorry. And I know it was a little tiny studio that put the game together, but my advice, you guys, if some of them should actually hear the show or the fans hear the show, you've got to evolve the genre of the game with the game.

20:57.760 --> 21:08.760
For me, the game didn't change between the 4-bit and the 128-bit. What really changed? The graphics? And now you can flick your Wiimote to jump or whatever. It's not enough.

21:08.760 --> 21:21.760
And in the end, it's still about competing for a high score, which works for an Atari 2600-style game, but games weren't about just competing for high scores when you moved on into later generations. I think that's what they forgot.

21:21.760 --> 21:29.760
You know, that speaks so true to life, because really, people never change. They just get older and then are able to flick their Wiimote.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.760
Shut up.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.760
So I don't recommend Bit Boy, sorry.

21:34.760 --> 21:50.760
As far as other games I played this week on the Wii, a newer type of exercise game that came out from EA called EA Active. I got a gift card for my birthday I finally spent this week, and I decided I was going to take the plunge because I've gained quite a bit of weight.

21:50.760 --> 22:00.760
Last year, I lost a lot of weight when I had my surgery. As I'm sure a lot of you guys know, I didn't have gastric bypass. I had gallbladder surgery, but with all the sickness I had last year...

22:00.760 --> 22:02.760
If you had gastric bypass, you'd be losing weight.

22:02.760 --> 22:12.760
Exactly. I lost a lot, a lot of weight in the last year. I went down from like 225 to like 185. I'm not even joking. I lost about 40 pounds, everything that happened last year.

22:12.760 --> 22:20.760
I'm back up to about 200 and change, so I kind of want to exercise to get myself down to maintain a level of about 195.

22:20.760 --> 22:29.760
And I thought, okay, I'm going to pick up this new game, this EA Active, because what I like about it from what I'm hearing on the box is that it has this customized training program, and that's what I need.

22:29.760 --> 22:34.760
Because Wii Fit, what's Wii Fit? It's a clusterfuck of games and a way for you to measure your body fat once in a while.

22:34.760 --> 22:46.760
But if I don't really know what I'm doing or what exercises I ought to be playing, that's one thing that Wii Fit really falls short in, is that it's just kind of all these exercises, and you kind of have to know what parts of the body you want to exercise.

22:46.760 --> 22:54.760
But EA Active has a 30-day program. So I bought the game, decided to check it out, and okay, it's not bad.

22:54.760 --> 23:04.760
It does support the Wii Balance Board, but it's not required to play. The game basically has two little add-ons that come with it that are extremely cheap, but you've got to consider the game costs $59.99.

23:04.760 --> 23:13.760
One of the peripherals is basically a gigantic rubber band that you put these two straps on that's like a resistance band, which is actually...

23:13.760 --> 23:15.760
Resistance bands are great.

23:15.760 --> 23:24.760
Yeah, it's actually kind of a creative, cheap exercise tool. I've got to give them credit for that. It actually works for doing bicep curls and things of that nature.

23:24.760 --> 23:33.760
The game also comes with a strap that you strap to your leg that you put the nunchuck in that would be ten times more awesome if it didn't keep falling off my leg while I'm exercising.

23:33.760 --> 23:38.760
Because even as tight as I will make that thing, inevitably it slips off my leg and starts to fall.

23:38.760 --> 23:47.760
It needed to have something where I can maybe clip it onto my shorts or something. It needed something else besides just the velcro around my hip. It needed something to secure it in place.

23:47.760 --> 23:57.760
They do have a lot of third-party companies making peripherals. They even have one that has three different types of resistance bands, and they also have a different type of leg strap thing, so that might be the way to go.

23:57.760 --> 24:08.760
I don't know, but it comes with this thing with the nunchuck, and it's kind of neat. It allows for all these different types of activities. And that's one thing I did notice about EA Active is that it is set up more like a, hey, this is an exercise program.

24:08.760 --> 24:13.760
And we're going to show you all these videos that show you how to do the exercise, then you're going to do the exercise.

24:13.760 --> 24:21.760
And I really felt like, granted, I don't have numbers to put side by side, but I did feel like EA Active has a higher variety of exercises in them.

24:21.760 --> 24:35.760
As far as the fun factor, though, I don't think EA Active necessarily has the cutesy, fun look of Wii Fit, the really motivating type of cutesy, let's have a good time, Wii Party type of thing.

24:35.760 --> 24:42.760
I didn't really see that in EA Active. It's a little more serious. And the graphics don't really even seem as good as Wii Fit.

24:42.760 --> 24:48.760
But you have to consider, what is this game for? It's not there to be cute and amusing and entertaining. It's there to help you exercise.

24:48.760 --> 25:01.760
And it does get that job done fairly well. My biggest bitch, some of the trying to watch your body do these motions, the game is not very good at picking up.

25:01.760 --> 25:09.760
There's one in particular, the lunges you do on your feet, you basically lunge down, kind of like you crouch with one leg and bend your other leg at a 45 degree angle.

25:09.760 --> 25:17.760
I am having the hardest time with the game picking this up. And I'm doing them the right way and everything, but there's no way to tell the game, okay, I'm doing it, just move on.

25:17.760 --> 25:22.760
Like, if you are not doing the exercise correctly, you kind of have to twist and move your body until the game picks up.

25:22.760 --> 25:29.760
And I was literally sitting there for like a minute, two minutes, trying to move around getting the game to detect me and it wouldn't do it.

25:29.760 --> 25:34.760
So eventually I had to hit the button to skip the entire exercise. Well, I didn't get credit for doing the exercise.

25:34.760 --> 25:42.760
So I wish there was a way you could just hit the two button or something and skip the step or something as opposed to skipping the entire exercise.

25:42.760 --> 25:50.760
It really would go a long way. Otherwise, the detection was fairly good in most things. The only other place I'm going to be critical of the game is the soundtrack is really boring.

25:50.760 --> 25:58.760
And it tries to say that, oh, it has all these genres, it has electronica and dancebeat and 80s, none of them are recognizable songs.

25:58.760 --> 26:02.760
And when you consider a company like EA, usually license is pretty good music.

26:02.760 --> 26:03.760
They have EA track?

26:03.760 --> 26:08.760
Exactly. For a game like Burnout and so on, the fact that they couldn't do the same for a game like this is really disappointing.

26:08.760 --> 26:12.760
And maybe they're waiting to see how a game like this is received so that they can do it in the sequel or something like that.

26:12.760 --> 26:16.760
But I really just wanted to turn the damn thing off and put on my own music.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.760
They're just having expansions.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.760
Is that really the plan?

26:20.760 --> 26:21.760
They've already announced them, yeah.

26:21.760 --> 26:27.760
Oh, really? That could be interesting. I don't know. By the way, some of the activities use the balance board, which is okay.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.760
Again, I don't think the balance board activities were nearly as fun as the ones on Wii Fit.

26:31.760 --> 26:41.760
But again, what I like about the game, when I do the 30-day workout, which is about like a 30-minute workout every two days on, one day off for 30 days,

26:41.760 --> 26:44.760
when you do this little 30-day workout, I really feel it the next day.

26:44.760 --> 26:49.760
Like, it's a good workout, and I like the fact that it's like a rounded workout.

26:49.760 --> 26:56.760
So if you're looking for a game that's going to put you on a workout plan, I think EA Active does a better job of that.

26:56.760 --> 26:59.760
And it sounds like this could be the start of a much better franchise.

26:59.760 --> 27:10.760
And it does seem exciting because when we get things like Project Natal to come out that will hopefully detect your body motion a lot better than the Wii Nunchuck and Wii Motor allowing,

27:10.760 --> 27:15.760
I'm just excited for the possibilities that something like Project Natal can bring to exercise gaming.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.760
That actually sounds like it'd be a lot of fun.

27:17.760 --> 27:22.760
It's not a bad game by any means. There's just some little things I think can be done a little better.

27:22.760 --> 27:26.760
But it sounds like, you know, if this is the start of a franchise, it's a decent start.

27:26.760 --> 27:31.760
Or hello, support the goddamn SD memory card, put your own MP3s on there.

27:31.760 --> 27:37.760
Right, right. And the other thing I should point out, you don't have to have the balance board to play this game.

27:37.760 --> 27:41.760
I think it goes a long way in making some of the other activities a little more fun.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.760
But technically, you don't have to have it.

27:44.760 --> 27:49.760
So if you're willing to endure without the balance board, you can pick up this game for $59.99.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.760
Not a bad deal.

27:51.760 --> 27:56.760
And the EA's part, that's actually kind of smart because it puts out an exercise game that's cheaper than Wii Fit,

27:56.760 --> 28:00.760
yet also enhances Wii Fit. I got to credit EA with that one.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.760
So that was pretty much my gaming week, was those two games.

28:03.760 --> 28:08.760
And I'm still feeling sore from just the two days of Wii workout I did earlier in the week.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.760
I skipped yesterday. I have to do some when I go home tonight because I don't want to miss a day.

28:12.760 --> 28:16.760
Because I have to be thin and beautiful before the Reno show in August.

28:16.760 --> 28:20.760
All right. Anyhow, let's see.

28:20.760 --> 28:21.760
I just got an idea, by the way.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.760
What's that?

28:22.760 --> 28:25.760
Well, I was showing off screen caps of the house that I made in The Sims.

28:25.760 --> 28:26.760
Uh-huh.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.760
I'm thinking about doing OLR exclusives.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
Go for it.

28:29.760 --> 28:30.760
Yeah, why not?

28:30.760 --> 28:31.760
Why not?

28:31.760 --> 28:37.760
So I will do, as soon as I can actually get to a point where I can save that property, I will do exclusive Sims.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.760
I should make ones of you guys.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.760
Go for it.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.760
I've got one of me.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.760
I'll be fine. I'd be fine with that.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.760
I read you some comments from chat, chat.orensonsrated.com.

28:45.760 --> 28:51.760
Xenocore says, Rob, screw this EA crap. Get you some P90X Interactive Online Extreme.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.760
Work out until your insides come out.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.760
I'm not aware of this game.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.760
Maybe it's something I need to do more research on.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.760
I'd be okay with looking that up.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.760
Sounds interesting.

29:01.760 --> 29:07.760
I like the idea of an online game where I can kind of get motivated with friends and in a community.

29:07.760 --> 29:11.760
I think that's one big thing that the Wii workout programs are missing.

29:11.760 --> 29:18.760
And I think, you know what, I really hope that when Project Natal comes out, a big, big exercise game is not far behind.

29:18.760 --> 29:24.760
Because I think one place where Xbox Live is going to really blow these Wii games out of the water is the online component.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.760
It's going to be very interesting to see what that brings to the table.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.760
But I'm curious about the other game. I'll check it out, I guess.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.760
I don't think it's necessarily a game.

29:30.760 --> 29:35.760
It's just, it's an extreme home fitness training system, they call it.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.760
Oh, God.

29:37.760 --> 29:38.760
Sucker.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.760
I'm a sucker.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.760
What is it? Some type of...

29:42.760 --> 29:44.760
It's just like working out, like hard.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.760
Interesting. I'll check it out. I'll Google it.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.760
Alright, anyhow, let's move on though with some housekeeping tonight quickly.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.760
Xenocore says, please tell me he knows that's a joke.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.760
No, I didn't know it's a joke. I've never heard of it before.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.760
Thank you, Loki, for doing the research.

29:58.760 --> 30:04.760
Alright, let's see, going on to some stuff within the community.

30:04.760 --> 30:10.760
You can join our Twitter at twitter.com slash O-L-R or you can always join us as well on LiveJournal,

30:10.760 --> 30:12.760
username OrangeLounge. We also have a Facebook group.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.760
Just search for O-L-R-M-Y, O-L-R-M-Y.

30:15.760 --> 30:21.760
Rob, I was also going to say, I believe they did a blog for EA Sports Active,

30:21.760 --> 30:26.760
The 30 Day Challenge, and I think, I don't know if they're starting it again.

30:26.760 --> 30:30.760
It's, I guess there's someone else that's taking the 30 Day Challenge.

30:30.760 --> 30:35.760
Peter Moore basically said that you'll lose weight after 30 days or something like that,

30:35.760 --> 30:40.760
but I was trying to find, they had one person that actually completed it,

30:40.760 --> 30:43.760
and I wanted to see what the results were.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.760
Unfortunately, I cannot, oh, here we go.

30:47.760 --> 30:53.760
You know what's funny? I am using the Wii Fit channel to weigh myself in every day.

30:53.760 --> 30:59.760
Jayrod in chat said, Richard Simmons presents, Sweeten to the 80s.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.760
You know what? I would actually buy a game like that.

31:02.760 --> 31:06.760
Say what you want about how odd Richard Simmons is, but you know what?

31:06.760 --> 31:10.760
He's a highly motivating guy, and what bad thing has he ever done,

31:10.760 --> 31:14.760
besides being a little bit weird, right?

31:14.760 --> 31:17.760
Also, my mother loves him, so no joke.

31:17.760 --> 31:18.760
I think he's fantastic.

31:18.760 --> 31:19.760
I think he is too.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.760
This person actually did it for 30 days.

31:22.760 --> 31:32.760
They started off that their weight was 235, and some other habits he also brought on.

31:32.760 --> 31:39.760
He drank half his body weight in fluid ounces of water, which you're supposed to,

31:39.760 --> 31:42.760
so 120 ounces of water a day.

31:42.760 --> 31:47.760
This is roughly 500 calories before resting.

31:47.760 --> 31:56.760
150 grams of protein, 4 to 6 small meals, avoided carbs, and plenty of fiber.

31:56.760 --> 32:03.760
Besides all that, and did the exercises, they lost 12.5 pounds in 30 days.

32:03.760 --> 32:07.760
Hmm. Not bad. Not bad.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.760
You notice, though, it's about changing other lifestyles, too,

32:10.760 --> 32:13.760
which the game will tell you. It will kind of walk you through that,

32:13.760 --> 32:15.760
but it's not like the game can tell what you ate yesterday.

32:15.760 --> 32:22.760
Yeah, I mean, drinking water is good, eating lots of meals, smaller meals instead of big meals,

32:22.760 --> 32:27.760
something I really needed to do, but I started myself until lunch.

32:27.760 --> 32:28.760
That's not healthy.

32:28.760 --> 32:29.760
I know it's not.

32:29.760 --> 32:35.760
And then I go get the third pounder burger, which is really not healthy, but I don't care.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.760
All right, let's get into some actual gaming.

32:37.760 --> 32:38.760
If I may say one thing, though.

32:38.760 --> 32:39.760
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

32:39.760 --> 32:45.760
The first and foremost thing is starting to create the healthy self-image before you do any of this.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.760
If you're going to do it, do it for the right reasons.

32:47.760 --> 32:52.760
Don't do it because, oh, I want to be skinny and pretty. Skinny is not pretty.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.760
But I do want to be skinny and pretty.

32:54.760 --> 32:55.760
You know what I mean.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.760
Sorry, Rob, you can only pick one.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.760
I just want to be back where I was before. That's my goal.

32:59.760 --> 33:03.760
See, that's what, you remember when I had pneumonia and lost all that weight?

33:03.760 --> 33:10.760
I'm actually trying to get back to that size because I had more energy when I was that size.

33:10.760 --> 33:11.760
Or you could do a tapeworm diet.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.760
Shut up.

33:12.760 --> 33:13.760
I wouldn't mind a tapeworm.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.760
Oh, you guys are disgusting.

33:15.760 --> 33:22.760
But yeah, one thing that's important about these types of games, you're not going to get thin just buying the game and looking at the box.

33:22.760 --> 33:26.760
At the same time, you're not going to get thin buying the game and playing it for five minutes a day.

33:26.760 --> 33:34.760
At the same time, you're not going to get thin by buying the game, playing it for 30 minutes one day out of an entire week.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.760
You have to make a commitment to exercise five times a week.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.760
And I'm taking that walking class.

33:40.760 --> 33:46.760
They say you need to get your heart rate up for 20 minutes a day or at least three times a week.

33:46.760 --> 33:56.760
Get your heart rate up to at least 65% of your max heart rate and then hold it there for at least 20 minutes.

33:56.760 --> 33:57.760
Alright.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.760
And that's the way to do it.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.760
Alright, so think carefully before you jump into one of these Wii exercise programs.

34:02.760 --> 34:08.760
I think they can work because I think anything is better than your big butt sitting on the couch playing a game for 30 minutes.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.760
I mean, if you're up and moving, that's certainly better than that.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.760
So anyway, let's move on.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.760
Let's get into some gaming stories tonight.

34:15.760 --> 34:18.760
And Loki's going to start us off with some gaming discussion.

34:18.760 --> 34:22.760
Yes. Dragon Quest IX came out just last week.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.760
And of course, it's already sold millions of copies.

34:25.760 --> 34:30.760
In fact, it sold 2.3 million copies in two days, which is pretty awesome.

34:30.760 --> 34:36.760
Totally blowing away any other game that was coming out that week or actually even out at the time.

34:36.760 --> 34:40.760
Just completely knocked everything out of the water as far as sales goes.

34:40.760 --> 34:43.760
But of course, Dragon Quest is a huge series in Japan.

34:43.760 --> 34:47.760
Not so much over here, but hey, we're working on it.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.760
That's pretty cool.

34:50.760 --> 34:55.760
And it's not a big surprise that it did well.

34:55.760 --> 35:00.760
But hopefully it will do well when it comes over here.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.760
It probably won't.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.760
Well, it's not going to do that good.

35:04.760 --> 35:11.760
I think definitely Dragon Quest has its fans that will justify Square translating the game and bringing it out over here.

35:11.760 --> 35:16.760
Although I think they do lose a little bit in sales from not doing it a little faster.

35:16.760 --> 35:21.760
Because I think you do get people that import the game and or steal the game while it's out in Japan.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.760
So I think they need to get their turnaround times down a bit.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.760
But I think the game will still sell decent enough.

35:27.760 --> 35:34.760
But let's just face it, it's not Halo or Madden or the things we go crazy about in this country.

35:34.760 --> 35:35.760
True.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.760
Although Dragon Quest IX certainly has its fans.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.760
Although people do go crazy for Final Fantasy.

35:39.760 --> 35:42.760
I think Final Fantasy has a bit more name recognition.

35:42.760 --> 35:49.760
And also keep in mind that Dragon Quest had a different name when we first got them over here, remember?

35:49.760 --> 35:54.760
True, and they didn't really come back until 8 came out over here on the Playstation 2.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.760
7 was out here, right?

35:56.760 --> 35:59.760
No, they did. Keep in mind, 2 and 3 were out on the Nintendo.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.760
It's the Super Nintendo generation they completely skipped, which I think hurt them in the long run.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.760
Because we all got Final Fantasy 2 and 3.

36:05.760 --> 36:11.760
I understand that, but they didn't really come back big time until 8.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.760
True, true. I understand.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.760
That was a big marketing push, too.

36:15.760 --> 36:20.760
I think even though we had Dragon Quest VII was out on the Playstation 1, I don't remember ever hearing about it.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.760
It was really Dragon Quest VIII where they really started pushing it.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.760
But that was also the first game under the Square Enix banner, if I remember right.

36:26.760 --> 36:31.760
Maybe Enix just didn't have the marketing push here in America that it did over in Japan.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.760
I think that's a big part of it.

36:33.760 --> 36:37.760
Now, I hear this game has been getting a lot of negative feedback on Amazon.com,

36:37.760 --> 36:40.760
although I guess that ultimately doesn't matter now, does it?

36:40.760 --> 36:43.760
It's the sales that drive it, not the ratings.

36:43.760 --> 36:47.760
Although, it would be interesting to see what happens next week.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.760
You know, if the sales numbers take a big dive or what happens.

36:51.760 --> 36:55.760
Orlan in chat says, Final Fantasy is dead.

36:55.760 --> 36:59.760
Really? I don't know. I think Final Fantasy XIII is going to do well.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.760
I don't think that it's dead.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.760
I think that it'll lull.

37:03.760 --> 37:08.760
I don't think it's as popular as it was in the Playstation 1 era,

37:08.760 --> 37:10.760
but I think the games will still sell like crazy.

37:10.760 --> 37:16.760
I think XIII is going to be the biggest selling RPG on both platforms, both Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.760
But it's still not going to sell Halo-sized numbers, that's for sure.

37:19.760 --> 37:22.760
But it'll be a big game.

37:22.760 --> 37:26.760
Maybe combined it will. I don't know.

37:26.760 --> 37:31.760
See, and then Orlan goes on to say, X marked the end of good Final Fantasy games.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.760
But see, there's tons of people that would debate that.

37:33.760 --> 37:35.760
Because some would even say X wasn't a good Final Fantasy game.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.760
A lot of people love XII.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.760
Yeah, I thought XII was fine.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.760
It's just XII came out at a really bad time.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.760
And XII really should have just been made for the next-gen systems.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.760
I think that was the biggest problem with Final Fantasy XII.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.760
It really missed out.

37:49.760 --> 37:53.760
Final Fantasy XI, you know, that's a whole other thing.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.760
Maybe Final Fantasy XI should have just been Final Fantasy Online.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.760
I think the whole fact that they did an online game with a number really turned some people off.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.760
But guess what? It's going to happen again with Final Fantasy XIV.

38:03.760 --> 38:06.760
I don't care, because I'm buying Final Fantasy XIV.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.760
XI was fun for a while.

38:08.760 --> 38:13.760
Granted, it had its rough spots in the beginning, but now a lot of that's just been patched out.

38:13.760 --> 38:18.760
But I still enjoyed it, even with all the frustrations of it.

38:18.760 --> 38:23.760
And I would still be playing it today if I had the time to play it, but I don't.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.760
So I'm not.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.760
But it was awesome. I mean, I wouldn't be going the while.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.760
Fuck that shit.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.760
ActDeft reminds us in chat, Famitsu gave it a perfect score.

38:32.760 --> 38:36.760
That's right, Dragon Quest IX got a perfect score in Famitsu, which is the first-

38:36.760 --> 38:38.760
Damn near impossible, too.

38:38.760 --> 38:41.760
It's the first Dragon Quest game to do so, actually.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.760
Which is kind of surprising.

38:43.760 --> 38:46.760
So it's funny, because you have that, and then you have the Amazon.com reviews

38:46.760 --> 38:48.760
where a lot of the users are slamming the game.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.760
But I don't know, is that just angry internet wank?

38:51.760 --> 38:54.760
Yeah, the internet is angry.

38:54.760 --> 38:58.760
I don't know how to tell until I actually buy the game myself, but we'll see.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.760
By the way, I guess more and more games.

39:00.760 --> 39:04.760
Remember when that was a hella hard thing to get, was a perfect 40 in Famitsu magazine?

39:04.760 --> 39:07.760
There was only like four games that had it for the longest time.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.760
Now there's like 10 or 11 that have gotten a perfect 10.

39:10.760 --> 39:14.760
Yeah, they're starting to move to the IGN scoring method there.

39:14.760 --> 39:18.760
Apparently Nintendogs was one of the games that got a perfect 40 in the history.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.760
Yeah, it was a perfect 40 for the first 40 minutes.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.760
And then after that, it's just like, wait, why am I building this?

39:24.760 --> 39:31.760
Exactly. Also, Final Fantasy XII was the first Final Fantasy game to get a perfect 40 for Famitsu magazine.

39:31.760 --> 39:37.760
So some would argue that XII was not a good Final Fantasy game.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.760
Yeah, Xenocore says, Rob, some said Famitsu has lost its bite.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.760
They have given out four perfects in the last year. This is true.

39:43.760 --> 39:50.760
You look at how much difference there is between now and the past, and it's definitely different.

39:50.760 --> 39:54.760
Anyhow, that's all we've got on Dragon Quest IX for now.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.760
I think we'll come back to it a little later in the show.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.760
I want to talk about The Conduit, which is a game that came out here in the US.

39:59.760 --> 40:04.760
It was supposed to be a really big title over here, but I don't think the game's been selling very well, has it?

40:04.760 --> 40:05.760
Nope.

40:05.760 --> 40:09.760
No, that's sad. What's wrong with The Conduit? Why is it not selling well?

40:09.760 --> 40:16.760
It's because it's more of a mature type of game, and unfortunately there's not a lot of those people on the Wii.

40:16.760 --> 40:21.760
Interesting. So now maybe Nintendo's marketing is coming back to bite them a little bit.

40:21.760 --> 40:25.760
Although, in the scope of things, does it really matter? They don't care.

40:25.760 --> 40:30.760
No, it really comes down to Nintendo being retarded, and it's retarded in their own benefit, and here's why.

40:30.760 --> 40:35.760
Because with the GameCube, they were frustrated that the system was viewed as a system for kids,

40:35.760 --> 40:41.760
and that they couldn't get any good third-party franchises that were more mature to work out for them.

40:41.760 --> 40:46.760
They thought, okay, the Wii is going to be different. It's going to be this all-around system that everyone's going to love.

40:46.760 --> 40:50.760
Except they had Resident Evil 4, which was one of the best third-party games to come out last generation.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.760
Well, there's exceptions to all the rules, but that's not the point.

40:53.760 --> 40:58.760
The point is, then the Wii comes out instead of, hey, we're going to take what we learned from the GameCube,

40:58.760 --> 41:02.760
and we're going to make this better, and we're going to market it to everybody.

41:02.760 --> 41:08.760
No, we're just going to market it to the kids now, and casual gamers, and grandmas, and go with that.

41:08.760 --> 41:15.760
And really, if you ask me, I don't think they give a crap about the third-party, mature-rated games.

41:15.760 --> 41:25.760
I think it's a good genre they have on that system, because there's people like me that don't want to go play Mario Tennis,

41:25.760 --> 41:31.760
or Mario Soccer, or Mario Badminton, or whatever the hell they're going to come out with next.

41:31.760 --> 41:38.760
So, Conduit, if I had time, once again, it's another game that I have that I just haven't gotten to play yet.

41:38.760 --> 41:43.760
If I had the chance to play it, then yeah, I'd probably enjoy it, because I enjoyed MadWorld a lot.

41:43.760 --> 41:50.760
And this was one of those games that was high-voltage studios, it was really impressive, the tech demo and everything.

41:50.760 --> 41:59.760
But I think overall, it's a good game, but it wasn't like, oh my god, this is better than Metroid, better than everything.

41:59.760 --> 42:04.760
I mean, they've done a lot of things right with it, but at the same time, it's a very generic shooter.

42:04.760 --> 42:09.760
A lot of the same cliches that you would see in Halo and pretty much every other sci-fi shooter out there.

42:09.760 --> 42:14.760
Had really good online, but that's kind of being ruined now.

42:14.760 --> 42:18.760
But it's just, I don't know, even MadWorld didn't do that well.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.760
Alright, well, looking at some comments from chat, J-Rod says,

42:20.760 --> 42:26.760
Conduit is a very mediocre title. It's only hyped because it's on the Wii, the barren wasteland of third-party games.

42:26.760 --> 42:31.760
And then Fear the Claw says, it's a passable shooter, but not the amazing game it should have been, but not really a bad game.

42:31.760 --> 42:36.760
J-Rod also continues on to say, people also slammed Conduit because it wasn't Metroid Prime on the Wii.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.760
Anyway, that's actually not the story I wanted to talk about.

42:39.760 --> 42:45.760
What I wanted to talk about is that there's a hacker out there named HitoAn2 that apparently has hacked the shit out of this game.

42:45.760 --> 42:54.760
Apparently you can hack this game very easily to get infinite ammo, health, invisibility, off the radar, and just all these hacks.

42:54.760 --> 42:56.760
By the way, you can also hack it online.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.760
The hacker said, everything is virtually unprotected.

42:59.760 --> 43:07.760
All values can be edited fairly easy, and there's virtually no sign of an attempt at hiding values, fixing bugs, or preventing online hackers.

43:07.760 --> 43:11.760
The hacker goes on to say that hacking online is cake.

43:11.760 --> 43:17.760
Quote, the only difference is in the online mode, the game sends the variables in real time to the server.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.760
And apparently some patch codes actually came out for the game.

43:20.760 --> 43:28.760
And I guess initially he altered them to actually make the save files corrupt for anybody that used them.

43:28.760 --> 43:37.760
And I guess he's working with the people that created the game to see who used them, and then they're gonna ban them.

43:37.760 --> 43:42.760
Whoever installed this cheat, they're actually gonna ban, which is kind of an interesting end to the story.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.760
Yeah, it's an interesting end to the story, seeing as they can't do that.

43:45.760 --> 43:47.760
It's impossible to ban people.

43:47.760 --> 43:53.760
In fact, it's hilarious that they even mention that, because they try the same thing with Mario Kart, banning people.

43:53.760 --> 44:00.760
And you know what? You can use the same cheat devices that they're using to hex edit stuff to override the ban.

44:00.760 --> 44:02.760
So it doesn't really do anything at all.

44:02.760 --> 44:07.760
And basically, it sounds like they're using the Rockstar method of game programming,

44:07.760 --> 44:18.760
where they leave everything in very well-documented text files on the disc itself, and everything is labeled very properly with infinite ammo.

44:18.760 --> 44:22.760
Check one, toggle this on. It's just ridiculous.

44:22.760 --> 44:26.760
And thank you, Rockstar, for doing that, because it's awesome to mod your games.

44:26.760 --> 44:30.760
Well, look, but if you were playing a modded game online, you're kind of a butt anyway.

44:30.760 --> 44:33.760
I mean, it's one thing to do it in private circles. I know that's what you do, Loki.

44:33.760 --> 44:40.760
But if you actually go on Xbox Live and play these modded for infinite health and all this stuff, you're kind of a butt to begin with.

44:40.760 --> 44:41.760
Well, yeah.

44:41.760 --> 44:45.760
But if you want to hack your personal one-player game, have a ball.

44:45.760 --> 44:51.760
Or private circle games where everybody has infinite health and everybody has access to the same hacks, then fine.

44:51.760 --> 44:54.760
That's up to you and your hard-earned money.

44:54.760 --> 45:02.760
But going on Xbox Live or going on Nintendo Wi-Fi connection with these hacked games, you're kind of a douche, let's face it.

45:02.760 --> 45:07.760
Well, yeah. And there's a lot of people. Unfortunately, Mario Kart's been kind of ruined by it.

45:07.760 --> 45:11.760
And I'm not sure about Call of Duty or anything like that.

45:11.760 --> 45:16.760
But there's a lot of the popular Smash Brothers. There's a lot of people hacking that kind of stuff.

45:16.760 --> 45:21.760
I don't know. It's just something that they have to work out.

45:21.760 --> 45:27.760
And fortunately, we're kind of at a disadvantage because once again, Nintendo decided, you know what?

45:27.760 --> 45:31.760
We don't need to patch our games. We're just not going to put a patching system in there at all, period.

45:31.760 --> 45:38.760
So if your game is broken or you find out there's a glitch or something they should have fixed in the 11th hour, too bad.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.760
You're fucked.

45:40.760 --> 45:45.760
Couldn't they do something on the server side, though, that says if this does not equal this, then boot user?

45:45.760 --> 45:47.760
That's all they're going to be able to do as far as patching the game goes.

45:47.760 --> 45:54.760
They can only do it on the server end and maybe banning the IPs of those people or something like that.

45:54.760 --> 45:58.760
That would be the way to go if they could do that or ban the MAC.

45:58.760 --> 46:01.760
That's actually what it's been doing is banning the MAC address.

46:01.760 --> 46:08.760
But once again, all people are doing is hex editing the memory to alter their MAC address and boom, they're online again.

46:08.760 --> 46:14.760
So, oh well. It's bound to happen with every game.

46:14.760 --> 46:18.760
Alright, well, there you go. The game's being out there and being hacked.

46:18.760 --> 46:21.760
So if you want to hack this game, have fun.

46:21.760 --> 46:24.760
But the only thing I would say with that, don't go online.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.760
If you're going to hack, don't go online with it.

46:26.760 --> 46:30.760
Yeah, I'd totally play that game with infinite ammo and stuff like that because that's just fun.

46:30.760 --> 46:35.760
Just like doing that with Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.

46:35.760 --> 46:38.760
I played that game with infinite health and infinite rockets.

46:38.760 --> 46:40.760
That was a blast.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.760
Nice.

46:42.760 --> 46:49.760
Well, that's all I have to say about the Conduit and the latest hack, so let's move on to Dark Sacras for some more gaming news.

46:49.760 --> 46:57.760
Well, it's just a little something that I think is actually cool for our UK listeners is they put out a date for Scribblenauts in the UK.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.760
It's supposed to be coming out on the 25th of September.

47:00.760 --> 47:12.760
And basically, as we've talked about, you summon anything, practically, and then, you know, use it, whatever.

47:12.760 --> 47:16.760
Like all the lolcats in the universe.

47:16.760 --> 47:23.760
We've heard to death about Scribblenauts this game, and I have a bad feeling this is going to turn out like Nintendogs.

47:23.760 --> 47:29.760
Call me crazy, I have a bad feeling this game is going to go the way of Nintendogs where it's got all this hype pre-release,

47:29.760 --> 47:32.760
and then when it comes out, people are going to be like, okay.

47:32.760 --> 47:35.760
We'll be all into it, into it, into it, and then a month later, eh.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.760
Yeah, we read all the funny stuff online already.

47:38.760 --> 47:42.760
Well, I don't know. I just thought it was noteworthy that they put out the UK date.

47:42.760 --> 47:49.760
No, it's definitely noteworthy that it's coming to the UK as well, especially when those guys usually get screwed out of releases for a long, long time after we do.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.760
But, you know, again, it doesn't change my opinion on the game.

47:53.760 --> 48:03.760
We need that kind of technology with LittleBigPlanet where we can spawn, you know, babies attached to meat and blurred lines.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.760
I don't know.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.760
Did you have the suicide babies? Did you try to see if that was there?

48:07.760 --> 48:09.760
I haven't given up hope on this game yet.

48:09.760 --> 48:16.760
Maybe there'll be something on Xbox Live or something. It'd be kind of cool where you could do that in a big sandbox on Xbox Live, but I don't know.

48:16.760 --> 48:17.760
That would be neat.

48:17.760 --> 48:20.760
There's only so much Scribblenauts talk I can take.

48:20.760 --> 48:26.760
But also with that, they'd really not be able to, they'd have to super monitor the online content.

48:26.760 --> 48:35.760
You know, with a really powerful switch, you know, really powerful machine made out of switches in LittleBigPlanet,

48:35.760 --> 48:42.760
you could come up with something very similar to Scribblenauts where you would drop letters in these little boxes or something like that to spell words out

48:42.760 --> 48:46.760
and you could have it spawn an object or something like that and be able to interact with it.

48:46.760 --> 48:50.760
It could be done. It'd just be a lot of work.

48:50.760 --> 48:52.760
Work? Who wants to do that?

48:52.760 --> 48:54.760
Exactly. No one wants to do work.

48:54.760 --> 49:02.760
We have someone in chat asking, they didn't change their nickname so I don't know what their name is, but does anyone know what the game is going to be about?

49:02.760 --> 49:03.760
Like, is there a story or what?

49:03.760 --> 49:11.760
Yeah, the story is basically that you are collecting these star pieces and I'm not really sure why.

49:11.760 --> 49:14.760
Maybe they put the stars back in the sky or something like that, you know, cheesy.

49:14.760 --> 49:22.760
And then basically you just go through different levels and try to solve the puzzles given, you know, whatever.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.760
With an entire dictionary of weapons available to you.

49:25.760 --> 49:35.760
But they're also, you know, they have pars on each of the levels that you're trying to get, you know, the level finished with so many objects spawn or something like that.

49:35.760 --> 49:38.760
So it could be interesting and then the level editor would be nice.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.760
So Meat Baby will probably not solve every level.

49:41.760 --> 49:45.760
I'm going to try though. Definitely going to try that.

49:45.760 --> 49:57.760
A totally different subject. Microsoft is planning on bringing a music streaming service to, I don't know, I guess they're going to create their own music service.

49:57.760 --> 50:01.760
Not necessarily Last.fm, I mean, because they do have that coming to the Xbox.

50:01.760 --> 50:09.760
But this might be something different that they're going to create, you know, very similar like Pandora or something like that.

50:09.760 --> 50:16.760
That's actually going to be available as well. Maybe a competitor to Last.fm and Pandora.

50:16.760 --> 50:19.760
But basically this is coming from the Telegraph.

50:19.760 --> 50:32.760
And Peter Bale, the executive producer of MSN is saying that they're going to launch a music service imminently by the end of July.

50:32.760 --> 50:43.760
And I guess it will perform similar to Spotify, a streaming music service which offers both an ad supported listening option as well as a premium subscription with no ads.

50:43.760 --> 50:51.760
And, you know, not sure if they're going to integrate it with the Xbox, but I don't see why not.

50:51.760 --> 50:59.760
It's kind of interesting though that they would do this and then still have Last.fm integration with, you know, the Xbox and not their own service.

50:59.760 --> 51:05.760
Which is very strange unless Microsoft were going to buy Last.fm or something. But it's strange.

51:05.760 --> 51:11.760
Yeah, and they also have the Zune music library that they could be integrating with that as well.

51:11.760 --> 51:15.760
So maybe they're just going to have all these different services all tied together or something like that.

51:15.760 --> 51:29.760
And this is Chia100Matt in chat says knowing them they're going to buy Live3CC5 which is funny because that's kind of what this service sounds like. You can listen to the music with ads or all of the ads will be for their ad-free stream.

51:29.760 --> 51:32.760
That's what Live3CC5 was. Remember that?

51:32.760 --> 51:35.760
I'm so glad. We don't have to put up with that anymore.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.760
Yeah, it's kind of nice. I've got to say all things considered.

51:38.760 --> 51:47.760
As much as I miss having our own station that we have control of, things have worked out over here. Definitely we have Bobby as a lead in which has been very cool and all that.

51:47.760 --> 51:57.760
So yeah, I mean the move was a good thing. But Live3CC5, this sounds kind of like that. So it'll be interesting to see if all the ads are for the ad-free service.

51:57.760 --> 52:09.760
Very strange that they would have this when Last.fm is coming out as well unless Last.fm is not going to work the way we want to. Or the other thing to consider is that maybe it's not coming to the Xbox.

52:09.760 --> 52:17.760
All this story is that Microsoft is coming up with a service and maybe that's for use on PCs or Windows 7 or with the Zune.

52:17.760 --> 52:25.760
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's 100% coming to Xbox 360. I think everybody's making that assumption. But it would sure make sense of course.

52:25.760 --> 52:27.760
Yeah.

52:27.760 --> 52:33.760
So, I don't know. I guess we will see. Robocoon in chat says, I've checked up on Live3CC5. Damn, it's gone downhill.

52:33.760 --> 52:42.760
Actually, I did too because I heard some of those rates and the fees that kind of pushed us out of there in the first place and they decided to skyrocket.

52:42.760 --> 52:49.760
I understand why they were doing that. They were doing that in response to the government increase. I heard some of that got resolved this past week.

52:49.760 --> 52:53.760
So I went to Live3CC5 to see if their rates dropped for broadcasting. No.

52:53.760 --> 53:03.760
Hearing that there was also something similar happening to Terrestrial Radio as well, because I've been hearing ads when I listen to the radio, which is hardly ever.

53:03.760 --> 53:12.760
But I've been hearing ads saying, oh, they're going to start charging. They're going to take away the music that you listen to because they're going to start raising their licensing fees.

53:12.760 --> 53:15.760
I'm like, boo fucking who? Seriously.

53:15.760 --> 53:24.760
Well, I get it though. I don't understand why record labels keep trying to raise the prices of what it's going to cost for these broadcasters to do it.

53:24.760 --> 53:29.760
I mean, they are putting internet radio out of business, which is too bad because they're biting the hand that feeds them.

53:29.760 --> 53:38.760
How do people find new songs, the radio and stuff? If radio gets stupid or is just all ad-ridden, people are just going to go listen to the same old shit on their iPods.

53:38.760 --> 53:47.760
That's why most people have left radio. I think they're doing a dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb thing by demanding these higher rates. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.760
They're greedy. I stopped listening to the radio a long time ago.

53:49.760 --> 53:57.760
I rarely listen to it. I wish I had XM Sirius in my car. My next car, I want to get that. We'll see.

53:57.760 --> 54:09.760
Anyhow, speaking of making your own music, Rock Band is going to be getting a new rock band network. This is pretty interesting because this is coming exclusively to the Xbox 360, at least for now.

54:09.760 --> 54:16.760
It's kind of like, I guess you could say, to make a long story short, it's kind of like XNA, but for rock band songs.

54:16.760 --> 54:19.760
This is all from a report from Billboard Magazine.

54:19.760 --> 54:33.760
Apparently anyone, if you're in an independent band or if you're on a major label, if you want to get your song into rock band, you'll be able to essentially take your master versions with this software that's coming out, create your own music files, and then be able to put them in rock band.

54:33.760 --> 54:44.760
After they go through a service that makes sure that the songs are actually playable and have a reasonable difficulty, in other words, not too easy and not too difficult, and aren't stolen.

54:44.760 --> 54:51.760
So they'll all have to go through this kind of peer review service, but you'll be able to charge between 50 cents and $3 and you'll get 30% of whatever the track sales are.

54:51.760 --> 55:01.760
By the way, it's not going to go in the same rock band storefront that exists now. It's like a separate rock band store, but the songs will still load and be playable in rock band.

55:01.760 --> 55:07.760
So very interesting sort of development here, where now anyone can get a song into rock band, essentially.

55:07.760 --> 55:19.760
And then Harmonic says to Activision, and that's how you do it. Seriously, this is way better than the Guitar Hero store, where you can do the custom tracks and that kind of stuff.

55:19.760 --> 55:27.760
Their whole track editor. I mean, this is above and beyond that. Just so much. It's ridiculous.

55:27.760 --> 55:40.760
Granted, it's not free like the Guitar Hero store or whatever, but I think it's willing to be better. And you're going to see a lot of content on there now. Just loads of it.

55:40.760 --> 55:42.760
It's going to be all these bands that you've probably never heard of.

55:42.760 --> 55:46.760
I know. I think you're going to see a lot of crap, but there's some people that are really into indie bands.

55:46.760 --> 55:54.760
And I think where this is going to come in really handy is, let's say you have this indie band who's trying to sell CDs that's doing these concerts in local areas.

55:54.760 --> 56:02.760
Now they can say, hey, check out our song on rock band, and we're going to have flyers at the door that tell you how to get on the store and download our song on rock band.

56:02.760 --> 56:11.760
I think it's just an extra avenue for the struggling artists to make money, which even though 30% of 50 cents is very low, something's better than nothing. That's what they always say.

56:11.760 --> 56:18.760
But I can't imagine this is going to be easy to do, because you're going to have to essentially make your own note charts, is what it sounds like.

56:18.760 --> 56:29.760
The software looks pretty easy to use. You're basically just setting up, you know, you kind of map it out via MIDI and stuff, and you decide where you want your frets to go and that kind of stuff.

56:29.760 --> 56:34.760
And you can do it with the audio and for singing and that kind of stuff as well.

56:34.760 --> 56:41.760
Granted, it's going to take a little bit of work, but when you think about it, it doesn't cost them anything to upload their tracks.

56:41.760 --> 56:54.760
So yeah, they're only making 30% off of it, but you know what? 30% for no cost is excellent. I mean, there's no publishing fees or anything.

56:54.760 --> 56:59.760
And Deathwishing in chat is yelling, fucking punk, I want to see a lot of indie punk.

56:59.760 --> 57:10.760
And you know what, actually, and this kind of ties into something Bobby was talking about on his show tonight, the Bobby Black Wolf show, which is always on before us on All Games Radio at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on allgames.com on Sunday nights, right before we tape.

57:10.760 --> 57:20.760
He was talking about this story, I know, and was actually kind of asking us when we did the little tossover we do at the end of his show, kind of asking us about how we felt about country music coming to rock band.

57:20.760 --> 57:26.760
I know he was talking about all these other different genres. Well, this is going to blow the door wide open on all of that.

57:26.760 --> 57:37.760
Nowhere in here does it say you must put a rock song on the service. Somebody could upload a music file of a kit and drumming, and as long as it's of a reasonable difficulty, you could put it on the service.

57:37.760 --> 57:43.760
That would be awesome. I would like to see some drum and bass songs in there, like something like Pendulum or something.

57:43.760 --> 57:52.760
Is there anywhere in the rules say it has to be a particular type of song? I mean, I think it does say that you can't have, you know, fuck, shit, cock, piss, you know, as your lyrics.

57:52.760 --> 58:06.760
You know, you have to still have a family clean version of the song, but there's nothing to prevent you from doing, you know, the kit and band with their hit single Meow Meow Meow, you know, there's nothing to stop you from doing these type of experimental stuff.

58:06.760 --> 58:21.760
That's awesome. And in fact, I think they need that. And now everybody in the chat room is yelling out, early green day, tons of ska, and so on and so on, you know, and sure, everybody's going to be clamoring for this certain type of thing.

58:21.760 --> 58:34.760
But what this, this opens that up to possibly be a reality, which is kind of cool. You know, what also is cool is that now since Xbox Live has done a good job getting their marketplace online, and you can link directly to things in the store,

58:34.760 --> 58:41.760
how easy is it going to be for an artist to put on their website, click here to go to the Microsoft store and put our song in your queue.

58:41.760 --> 58:45.760
And if you're charging only 50 cents for your song, which would be how many Microsoft points is that?

58:45.760 --> 58:46.760
40.

58:46.760 --> 58:53.760
40 Microsoft points. Okay, so, you know, how many of us don't already have 40 points just kind of left over waiting to be spent?

58:53.760 --> 59:00.760
If you've ever used the Microsoft store before, you know, on Xbox Live, you usually have leftover points. It's part of the annoyance of having to buy clusters of points at a time.

59:00.760 --> 59:06.760
People are going to easily drop the 40 points, just click a button on the computer, and then it'll download next time you power on your Xbox.

59:06.760 --> 59:19.760
I do this all the time, by the way, for demos and things. I'll go on to the Xbox Live store, queue up the things I want to download, and then when I turn on my Xbox, they just come in like magic, which is cool.

59:19.760 --> 59:22.760
And some comments in chat.

59:22.760 --> 59:31.760
ActDef says, meaning I don't have to pay 99 US dollars for the service unless I want to upload songs. Not just anybody can upload songs.

59:31.760 --> 59:35.760
You have to be the copyright owner in order to basically upload the songs.

59:35.760 --> 59:41.760
And the other part I should have mentioned, you do have to be a member of the XNA development community in order to do this.

59:41.760 --> 59:51.760
But they are really selling this. Like, they're going to have its own little specialized little corner of the marketplace and all this stuff where, you know, a rock band developer's community.

59:51.760 --> 01:00:03.760
Which I do think it's going to be pretty big. I think it's going to be tough to find the gems you want amongst all the garbage that's about to hit on this.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:15.760
But if artists are smart about linking to the Xbox Live marketplace and making it very easy for you to drop money on their music, I think this has the potential to do very well, especially for a little tiny artist.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:25.760
And, you know, not necessarily us, because we don't have time to put it into it, but I know there's many websites out there that rate and review all the community games that come out.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.760
And I'm sure they're going to do the same thing when all these independent-

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.760
Well, you'll still be able to get the 30-second samples just like you can in a regular rock band, too.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.760
Yeah.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.760
So you can actually listen to the song. And I'm sure most artist websites will have it.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:46.760
That would be awesome to make, like, a 30-second portion of your song really kick ass and then the rest is just banging pots and pans and that's it.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:56.760
I think that you, myself, and Dark Soccer should all get a song on Xbox Live Marketplace that is us banging pots and pans together and yelling incoherent lyrics.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.760
Oh, wait, we need a ukulele.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:04.760
Yes, and a ukulele. We'll get Marissa up here to play some folk music that we'll add our pots and pans banging to. It'll be fun.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.760
Maybe we can look up Mo. I know she hasn't been on the show in a long, long time, but I don't know if you remember Mo, but she came on and sang Still Alive.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.760
Maybe we can get her to sing or something.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.760
Or we can get the Dalek to sing.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.760
Well, no, because that would be copyright.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.760
But we can get Shermy to meow. Tell me this would be epic.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.760
That would be a disaster.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.760
Deathwishing says, this is just what the music industry needed, Rob. I agree.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.760
How about something a little less disastrous, Rob?

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760
Alright, how about it?

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:36.760
Well, you know, Sony's been all, ooh, PSI, it's so cool, it's so cool.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:59.760
Well, actually, SCEE's head of developer services, Kishi Hirani, was saying that it can actually recognize face and individual feature, that it can, sorry, that it will be able to detect gender, age of face, different facial features, and tell what your expression is.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:08.760
And they actually did a whole presentation on it, saying that it actually tracks facial movement.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.760
It's supposed to be part of the motion controller demo.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:24.760
So I actually think that that's kind of neat, because then, like, if they do a game that you can map your features onto your character or something, you can actually map your animations as well.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.760
It'd be almost realistic expression.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:34.760
Well, I hope they actually do something with this instead of just releasing the demo and just going, oh, well, that was cool.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:43.760
And that's it, because they had those really cool tech demos where, you know, it was like a lunar lander type of game where you actually draw your landscape and then you go play it and stuff.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.760
And they showed that wonderful tech demo that was, like, combat.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.760
And did those ever come out? No, because they were tech demos, and that was it.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:58.760
So, awesome, you know, it can detect, you know, faces and stuff, but what the hell are you going to do with it, is what I ask.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.760
I just gave a suggestion of what they could do with it.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.760
Other than, you know, shine it up and shove it up their ass.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:12.760
Or better yet, when the hell are they going to do something with it, because the last I checked, Home still doesn't have trophy support in it.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.760
What, that was announced, what, how many years ago?

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:26.760
That would be kind of neat if your avatar in Home smiled and frowned as you were smiling and frowning sitting there on the couch or whatever, or your face is just left open agape at the whole hamsters versus humans, you know, type thing.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.760
That would be kind of cool.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:36.760
But, you know, I always kind of think about how this stuff can be tracked towards exercise gaming, and maybe the game would be able to tell when I am, like, too tired to move on.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:49.760
Like, you know, like that's the problem with one of these type of exercise games is that, you know, it doesn't really know how you're receiving the exercises, and a personal trainer can kind of tell, like, if you've had enough or if they can push you a little harder.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:59.760
Games don't know very well how to do that, but maybe, you know, just maybe a game like this could tell based on your expression, like the, oh my god, like, you know, to stop giving you a hard time.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:12.760
You know something else that actually occurred to me, and they were doing this as communication tools for quadriplegics, you know, especially people paralyzed from the neck down.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:23.760
And, you know, another thing too, remember the mind controller, I think it was for an Atari system, that it read your facial expression to control the game?

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:37.760
Well, what if they did have games that relied on your expression or special type of interface that you would be able to, like, you know, if you blink to move one way or lean your head to the side to go one way, you know.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.760
How about just a goddamn controller? Is that so difficult?

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760
Why do we got to complicate things?

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:53.760
But, I mean, I was just saying that actually would be something, if they created a kind of interface in a lot of games that would read motion, like for people who really can't play games, you know, who might enjoy it.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.760
Oh, so like making it more handicap accessible.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.760
Exactly.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.760
That might be kind of neat actually.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:08.760
You know, if it's recognizing the motions of your face, the motions of your head, you could easily lean your head to the side to go one way, lean it to go the other way, lean forward, lean back.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:17.760
You know, if it's reading eyebrows or your eyes, you can blink to jump or something or stick out your tongue to fart or something, I don't know.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.760
Interesting. Stick out your tongue to fart. Really, Jamie.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.760
I was thinking of a verb.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.760
Okay.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.760
You can do X with this part to do verb.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.760
Dartetsuya in chat says, maybe that's what Nintendo's heart monitor thingy is for.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.760
And I'm assuming he's referring to the exercise gaming.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.760
Perhaps.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.760
That could be part of it.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.760
Yeah, I'm sure Wii Plus, Wii Fit Plus Plus will now support that as well.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.760
Goody gumdrops.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.760
Yeah, unfortunate.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:58.760
Anyhow, we'll see what kind of games develop with this new technology, but for now we're going to talk about the games that are coming out right now as we travel the world with some release dates.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:08.760
Yes, and we have wonderful games utilizing technology as well, including Sins of a Solar Empire Game of the Year Edition, which is coming out on PC this week.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.760
Other fun stuff.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.760
G-Force.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.760
Okay, well maybe that's not fun, but it's a game.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:29.760
G-Force is coming out as well on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, and PSP based on the animated hamster, not hamster, guinea pig secret agent movie.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:35.760
Which, by the way, the PS3 and Xbox 360 are in 3D.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:45.760
Rock Bandit Country Track Pack is coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii this week as well.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:58.760
Also on Xbox 360 we have Watchmen The End is Nigh parts 1 and 2, and Watchmen The End is Nigh Complete on the PS3. Those are available as well.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:08.760
Little King's Story, which is coming out on the Wii, and got nominated for best role- or not best role-playing game, best strategy game out of E3.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:12.760
So that one should be pretty good, coming from Exceed.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:17.760
And, I think there's not too much else here.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:34.760
Yeah, looks like, of course, you know, it's not necessarily during the week, but Wii Sports Resort.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.760
Actually, that's next week. Never mind, jumping ahead.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:42.760
That's it. Oh, sorry, I completely missed this.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:47.760
King of Fighters XII, you know, that's a little bit important. That's coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.760
And the week from today, Wii Sports Resort with MotionPlus will be available as well.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.760
So, that's a big one.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.760
Fun.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:00.760
Alright, well, let's travel over to Japan and look at some of the Japanese release dates that are coming up.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:07.760
Guess what? On the Xbox 360, you can finally get the Japanese version of 50 Cent, Blood on the Sand, comes out in Japan this week.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.760
So, if you missed out on that gem, you can finally pick that up over there.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.760
Bethesda is localizing that, I guess, for Japan.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.760
50 yen, Blood on the Sand.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.760
There you go.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.760
Call of Juarez, Bound in Blood, also makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:27.760
As well as Devil May Cry 4, getting a price cut this week in Japan as it moves into the Platinum Collection over there.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:33.760
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, 50 Cent, Blood on the Sand and Call of Juarez also drop there, as well as Devil May Cry 4.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.760
But also, of note, Katamari Damacy Tribute makes its way out in Japan.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.760
So, I'm sure there's some folks looking forward to that.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.760
As well as a game called Toro to Morimori comes out as well.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.760
I'm not sure what this game is.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.760
Oh!

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.760
It's to celebrate the Doki demo issue series' 10th anniversary.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.760
The game carries on after the memorable last scene of the first Doki de Mishuu game.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.760
Toro continues to chase his dream to become a human after he left the player.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:06.760
One day, Kuro tells the white cat about the memory record, which can grant any wish after you fill it with gratitude.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.760
So, off Toro goes to help people.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:13.760
So, that's a game that you can check out, I guess, if you want, on the PlayStation 3.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.760
That's a very, very Japanese game.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.760
It looks kind of cute. I'm trying to figure out what kind of game it is.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.760
It looks very kind of adventure-like.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.760
You know, I always thought that cat looked like he was straight out of, you know, Animal Crossing.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.760
Hey, the game?

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.760
Wasn't that cat based off of doing emoticons and ASCII art?

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.760
It could be. It looks like it.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.760
Yeah, I think it's the cat that was done off of that.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.760
Hey, it comes with a clock for the PSP as well.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.760
Oh, I have to have that. I love stuff that comes with stuff.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.760
Exactly, right?

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.760
With stuff. Inside stuff.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:49.760
Hey, well, actually, you know that my, uh, I bought that whole Cardcaptor Sakura Dreamcast thing because it came with a plate.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.760
Nice.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.760
And a fork and a spoon and a pillowcase.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.760
Nice.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.760
On the Nintendo Wii, Punch-Out! gets its release in Japan this week.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.760
I was actually surprised to hear that they didn't have it first.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.760
That kind of surprised me.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.760
Uh, but another game that they got that we don't got, Dragon Ball.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.760
Tekanishi Daibuken comes out this week.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.760
We'll be having that soon enough.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.760
Yes, if you're a big fan of Dragon Ball Z, there you go.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.760
Your very own Wii game.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.760
Enjoy that in Japan this week.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.760
Moving on to the handhelds for a minute.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:24.760
Actually, going back to PlayStation 2, some games get a price reduction this week.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:28.760
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Musou Orochi get price reductions this week.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.760
Uh, moving on, though, to the handhelds.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.760
On the Nintendo DS, uh, just some accessories if you like Disney characters.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.760
Mickey, Minnie, and Stitch, just some accessories.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:44.760
Uh, but there's a new game coming out called Katakyuu Hitman Reborn DS Flame Rumble X.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.760
It's a fighting game on the DS if you want to check that out.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.760
Lastly, on the PSP, as I scroll on my list here to get to the PSP.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:56.760
Um, just some price reductions.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:00.760
Again, uh, Katakyuu Hitman Reborn Battle Arena gets a price reduction.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.760
And Musou Orochi also gets a price reduction.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.760
So, enjoy!

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.760
There you go, your Japanese release dates.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:07.760
Let's move over to Europe.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.760
Well, um, it's actually, again, kind of a slow week like last week was.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.760
On the 22nd, we have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time re-shelled.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.760
Yay!

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.760
Um, because that is one of my favorite turtle games ever.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:27.760
Um, Shatter on the 23rd for PS3 and on the Wii Sports Resort.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.760
Try saying that three times fast.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:31.760
That's it.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.760
Wii Sports Resort Resort.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760
See?

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.760
That's tough.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.760
Hmm.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.760
Um, so it's interesting.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.760
There's a game that's been out already in Japan, Trash Panic, which is on the PlayStation Network.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.760
It's getting a new version of that game, which is called 100 yen Gomibaku.

01:11:53.760 --> 01:12:00.760
And what that is, is it's actually a pay-to-play PSN game.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.760
And basically, it's going to work, you know, very similar to like a coin-up arcade game.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.760
It's going to cost you 100 yen, which is about a dollar, to download.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:16.760
And then it limits you to only three play sessions, at which point you have to pay another 100 yen to continue playing.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:25.760
But, if you complete one of the two modes in that game, it unlocks a bonus in the full version of the game.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.760
The steal mode will open up the same mode in the original game.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:35.760
And clearing normal mode will also open up five home rewards.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:42.760
And it's kind of interesting that they're putting out a game that you have to continue to pay to play.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.760
I don't know. I wouldn't buy it.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760
Why not?

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.760
Why not? Because they have the other versions available where you just pay one fee, one time.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:58.760
And, you know, once you're done with that, you can play the game as much as you want.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:04.760
Haven't people been talking about wanting this type of format for a game for a long time, though? You know what I mean?

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760
I suppose.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:14.760
You know, on Xbox Live Arcade, wouldn't the consumer really like to see, especially with some of these retro arcade releases that you pay $5 for and then play twice?

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:22.760
Wouldn't it be better to have, you know, a token type system where you just pay a quarter to play it once and then, you know, see if you want to play it again from there?

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.760
And if you like it a lot, then you can just buy it.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.760
No. Because that's what the demos are for. And the demos are free.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:35.760
So why the hell would I pay, you know, even a dollar for a game that I can demo for free and realize if I want it or not?

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:43.760
And you know what? It's my own damn fault if I buy a game that I think I'm gonna like and I play it a few times and then just leave it, you know, to rot in my, you know, game collection.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:14:01.760
As I have before with Doom and Duke Nukem 3D and Worms and Pac-Man and Dig Dug and all those other goddamn Namco games and other weird obscure Xbox Live Arcade games that I buy because they're cool and then I stop playing them.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.760
So, you know what? Too bad.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:11.760
But hey, if you want to, you know, throw away your money like that, I'm sure that, you know, Sony will be willing to take it.

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.760
But Sony doesn't release demos for all of their games either. Would you feel differently if you didn't have the demos to go off of?

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.760
Yeah, I would feel differently because that would, you know, make me feel like that they're trying to rip me off.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.760
And I don't like being ripped off. And they have a demo for this game.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:32.760
I don't know. I'm a little bit iffy on it. I think in some ways, you know, demos can be very limiting sometimes.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.760
I mean, some of those demos in Xbox Live Marketplace, you play one screen and you're done.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:42.760
Like, I would like a feature where I can play, like, a couple times to try to get the achievements, but once I've paid out, like, a dollar, I don't want to try anymore.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:51.760
You know, I think it would be kind of cool to have a game that kind of rewards you, you know, that I can kind of pay as you go instead of dropping five, ten dollars on it.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.760
And then, you know, I realize this isn't Xbox Live, but I'm making that comparison anyway. Whatever.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.760
Yara should pay me.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.760
Or that. Who knows.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.760
Yara should pay everybody and apologize for its existence.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.760
No, seriously, they should pay the consumer because it's an ad.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.760
And a horrible game. Mainly the horrible game is why they should have to pay out to everybody.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:22.760
Uh, BlackWolfinChat says, I would say about 90% of my DVD-based game collection I don't play anymore either. Would you consider that a waste of money, too?

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:28.760
No. Because you don't play it anymore. You did play it at a time. You don't just buy stuff and not play it.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.760
And who cares, you know?

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.760
I've had those games I played, like, once.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.760
Okay, Fusion Frenzy 2, case in point. I bought that game.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.760
I still have a wrapped version of Galarian's Ash.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:44.760
Wow. Played Fusion Frenzy 2 once, said to myself, the fuck was I thinking? And never played it again.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.760
Yeah, I could've told you that.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.760
Whatever. Oops.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.760
And I wanted to play through Galarian's Ash because you made people's heads explode.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.760
Well, then you should have played it.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.760
Well, maybe I will. I still have it.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.760
And I have an old PS3.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.760
You can always go back someday. I guess that's the thing.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.760
I actually have an old PS3, so it'll play it.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:05.760
I mean, seriously, nowadays with the internet and everything, I mean, hell, even back in the days where it was just gaming magazines,

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.760
I mean, you're not completely oblivious to whether a game is good or not.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.760
You have sites revealing them. You have friends that have played them.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.760
You can try demos. You can hear the buzz about it.

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:24.760
It's just, you know, I don't think this pricing model, unless you're just going to put out these games and have no ability to buy them,

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:32.760
and you just pay 25 cents or whatever, a pop. But even then, arcade games are meant to take your quarters.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.760
I know that. And you know what? I'm not going to play a PC game that's meant to take my quarters.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.760
That's like playing an indie casino. I mean, that's just going to take my money.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.760
Bobby goes on in chat. Bobby Black Wolf says,

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.760
But it's a waste of money to buy an XBLA game that you only played a few times and then not anymore?

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.760
Sounds like a double standard, just saying.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.760
Yeah, it is a waste of money to buy an XBLA arcade game that you're going to play a couple times.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:59.760
But you know what, though? I mean, if you think that you got your money's worth out of it, then that's fine.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:11.760
But let's take, for example, if you were to play the arcade version of Contra or some difficult shooter like that.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:22.760
Okay, I die quite often in those games. Frustrating level. So there goes my dollar really quick.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:28.760
And then by the time I actually play it enough, that would be like buying the game all over.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:35.760
I don't know. I don't see the point of really... unless maybe as a bonus or something, if you did really well in the game,

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:41.760
then you would unlock the full game or something like that and you'd keep it. Like, you know, kind of gambling almost.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.760
Black Wolf goes on. I want to move on topics, but I'll read this other little debate here.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.760
Okay, so XBLA game that you played a couple of times equals waste of money.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:58.760
DVD-based game that you played probably six times as much and only played a couple of times equals not a waste of money.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.760
No, it's still a waste of money.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:06.760
I think, though, sometimes you go into these games and you look back and you go,

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.760
wow, I really wasted my money. That's how I feel about BitBoy. I paid six bucks for that game and I'm like,

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.760
you know what, this game, that was a waste of money.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:20.760
Or like Left 4 Dead for me. I bought the game and I considered it a waste of money because I don't have time to play it

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.760
and I just don't really want to play it right now.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:28.760
But that's just the risk of entertainment sometimes, that you're not always going to be entertained.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:35.760
For instance, I've gone to a play that I spent 30, 40 bucks on tickets for and was not entertained and was like,

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:40.760
well, that was a waste of money. By the way, it was the Jesus Christ Superstar production here in Sacramento.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:46.760
It was terrible years ago. Let's see, what else was it? Movies all the time. Oh my God, there's so many movies.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.760
You pay $10 to go see the movie and then you're like, wow, that was a waste of my time.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:56.760
Especially when movies cost as much as they do, that's really tough when you pay that much to see a movie and then it sucks.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.760
And then add the food cost into that as well. That can be quite an investment.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.760
And I even think you get more of a value out of a video game than you do in a movie.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:11.760
No, see, now I knew you were going to say that because, oh, an Xbox Live Arcade game, you get X number of hours of entertainment out of.

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:16.760
In a movie, you get two hours of entertainment for the same price.

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.760
Go ahead.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.760
But my thing is, though, is that's apples and oranges.

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:29.760
I mean, a movie, you're going to be entertained at some level. I mean, you're not going to be retarded and actually just go to a movie that you're not going to like.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:35.760
And with a movie, if you really, really don't like it, you could probably go back to the front counter and get your money back.

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:41.760
You'd be surprised. I've gone to movies where I let friends or significant others pick the movie and I didn't like it.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:48.760
Well, that's your fault for trusting someone else's judgment and letting them steer the vehicle, I guess.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:53.760
But that's like letting my wife pick a movie or something like that sometimes.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:58.760
You know, and here's the thing, though, is that some movies, yes, you can get more of a value out of DVDs.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.760
You know, there's some DVDs like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion or Clue.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:08.760
I've easily watched those DVDs, or Rocky Horror Picture Show, shit, I've watched those DVDs easily 20 times each.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.760
You know, I would definitely say I got my money's worth out of those.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.760
Just like some video games, I probably only spend a little bit of money on.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:20.760
The original Geometry Wars, $5. Oh my god, I spent so much time on that game, right?

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.760
Or Super Mario Kart back on the old Super Nintendo.

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:27.760
But then there's other games I bought that I played a couple times where I was like, you know what, I didn't get the value out of it.

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:32.760
But that, like, what are some games I bought and played one time on Xbox Live Arcade?

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:37.760
Cloning Clyde, I think I played once and I bought it.

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.760
You know, eh, probably not the best choice to spend my money.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.760
But that's part of the risk.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.760
It really, when you look at it, I mean, it's good for them to try different price models.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.760
It's bad if they're going to try to force you into those other price models.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:58.760
You know, opening options is a good idea, but forcing you down really ridiculous options, that's another thing.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:08.760
And the way I see this game is more of like a bonus game that you can play to unlock other stuff in the other game.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:14.760
So it's kind of like an add-on that you just pay to play.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.760
Alright, well let's move on past this topic.

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:22.760
I just, you know, I think there's a lot more to be seen on this topic.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:25.760
It really depends on how some of these other games do.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:30.760
It's going to be interesting to see the precedent that some of these things might set.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.760
Anyhow, let's move on to another story.

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:37.760
And speaking of places you might go to buy games, Microsoft apparently is going to be launching retail stores this fall.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.760
That's right, you know, I have the Apple store in the mall.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.760
Guess what's coming? The Microsoft store.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.760
Apparently the first stores are going to be launching this fall.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.760
I haven't heard where yet, but I guess they're coming.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:51.760
And I don't know if that means you can actually take your Xbox 360 in there and get it repaired.

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.760
That would be kind of cool though, wouldn't it?

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.760
Ambitious though, don't you think?

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.760
No, I doubt it that you would be able to repair it at the store.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.760
But they are opening up storefronts.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.760
And just in time for Windows 7, right?

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.760
Yeah.

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:12.760
So, I guess, let's see, this was confirmed at the worldwide partner conference in New Orleans by the chief operating officer, Kevin Turner.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.760
But they haven't, I still don't see where the first store is going to be.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.760
I bet you though one of them is in Seattle.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.760
Yeah, probably.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.760
That's probably a gimme.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.760
Probably like Seattle, San Francisco, New York, L.A.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.760
You know, major cities.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.760
Well, competition is healthy, right?

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760
Exactly.

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.760
By the way, something else to note, Microsoft had actually hired a former Walmart executive, David Porter.

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.760
And he's going to be the corporate vice president of these retail stores.

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.760
That move was made back in February.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.760
So you've kind of seen this coming for a long time.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.760
I think these stores could be interesting.

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.760
I think competition is healthy.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:53.760
I think especially, you know, as much as I do enjoy Apple and I like the iPhone and stuff, I do think some of their shit is obscenely priced.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:23:01.760
And when you get out there in the mall, a laptop that's $400, like the one that I bought at Fry's, although sadly in a Microsoft store at the mall, they're probably not going to go that cheap.

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:08.760
But when you get these really cheap laptops next to the Apple laptops, it's going to really drive competition, I think, a little bit.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.760
Just a little.

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.760
I've been in Apple stores a few times.

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.760
My God, and you didn't melt?

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.760
Yeah, I almost did.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.760
Short exposures.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.760
But I hated being in them.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.760
They're blinding.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.760
I hated being in them because it reminded me of the whole Gateway PC stores that they used to have.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.760
Basically, you go in and you have to make an appointment to be helped.

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.760
I'm sorry. That's crap.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.760
Because they're so popular.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.760
Oh, we'll hire more employees in.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.760
Seriously.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:42.760
Oh, well, you can't blame us if the demand's really high.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.760
Oh, well, fuck you. Hire more employees.

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:46.760
Well, look, I feel-

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:53.760
If a restaurant is short staffed, do you go back to that restaurant when you have to wait to be served?

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.760
Fuck that shit.

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:55.760
I do.

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.760
If the food's really good, I do.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.760
If the food's really good, I'll go.

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.760
Okay, well, if they dress the food up really nice but the food is actually really inferior to cheaper food-

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.760
No, I wouldn't go back to that restaurant.

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:05.760
Okay, good.

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:08.760
I'm glad you see things my way.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.760
Anyhow, but this is an opinion, not a fact.

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.760
But anyway, you know what, though?

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:19.760
I think one thing that I do like about the stores, despite your complaint about them, I like the place that there's a place you can take your apple into to get fixed up.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.760
That there's a place where they have these classes that show off how to use the Apple hardware and software.

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:32.760
I think it's kind of neat that it ends up being a centralized place for Apple, despite the fact that the stores might charge a little more than you might find if you would just shop around.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.760
And the fact that they blind you, it's not a bad concept.

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.760
They really do blind you.

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.760
Wait, why would you need classes to use an apple?

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.760
I mean, I thought it was supposed to be user-friendly.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.760
Look, I'm talking about, like, not me. I'm talking about older people that want to- or some of the software that they put out for it.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.760
Like, maybe you've always wanted to use GarageBand, but you're just not sure how to begin, and it's not like you're going to read the manual.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.760
I think it's kind of cool that you could take a class on that.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:25:00.760
You know what, if we're going to make our Pots and Pans song, we're going to need an audio maker to do it, so we might have to use GarageBand, Loki.

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:01.760
No, we're not.

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.760
Adobe makes a really good program already.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:04.760
Fine, fine, fine.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.760
I love Creative Suite for-

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.760
I'll have to take a class on it, because I don't know how to use it.

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.760
I know how to use it. Adobe Audition, that's it.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.760
Well, yeah, but this is the program that they replaced Audition with, and it works just the same.

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.760
Oh, interesting.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.760
Yeah.

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:22.760
Well, we use it to tape our podcast, but that's it. Anyway.

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:28.760
Alright, so I'm curious to see what happens with these retail stores. I will definitely check them out when they're available.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.760
All this new stuff's getting on my nerves.

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:31.760
Why is that?

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.760
Just... my poor brain is... living in a cave.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.760
Living in this economy, though, it's nice to hear about stores opening up as opposed to stores closing.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.760
I sort of have a feeling that it's not going to last.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:50.760
And you know what, though? A Microsoft store going into a mall, that's one less spot that they can put a Hot Topic.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:51.760
Whatever.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.760
They can only have one Hot Topic per hour.

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.760
Or Cinnabon.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.760
You know they're going to have.

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:57.760
Hey, I like Cinnabon. That's delicious.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.760
Did you know, by the way, at Walmart this week, I was actually at Walmart, and I was looking at candles.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.760
They have candles that smell like Cinnabon.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.760
That's just a horrible cock tease right there.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.760
It needs to be real Cinnabon.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.760
But you can get the Cinnabon or like the Snickerdoodles.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.760
I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:16.760
Actually, at Cracker Barrel, the last time I was...

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.760
Which we don't have here.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:26.760
But they had a Cinnamon Monkey Bread scented one, which is like super delicious.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.760
Monkey Bread's hecka good.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:29.760
You can get that at the grocery store.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.760
Anyway, sorry. Orange Lounge Foodio. Let's move into the classic game of the week.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.760
It's the part of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.760
And Dark Sakura picks a game that she thinks, you know what?

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760
You guys should all be playing this game.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.760
Why the hell are you not playing this game?

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.760
God, really?

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.760
It's the classic game of the week.

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:50.760
And I believe tonight, in a little bit of a twist, it's the classic games of the week, correct?

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:51.760
Yes.

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:55.760
Alright, so Dark Sakura, tell us what games you gotta be playing this week.

01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:03.760
Well, it really is specifically to one game, but I have to mention the rest of the series.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:06.760
So I'm starting it off with Crush Pinball.

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:15.760
It actually all starts with Alien Crush, which still is probably the better of all of that series.

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.760
Sorry, there's a little bit of background noise in this particular movie.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:29.760
There's music here.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.760
Wasn't Extra Per Addicted a good idea?

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.760
Yes. Yes, very much so.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.760
They released a remake, I think, too. I don't remember that.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.760
We'll do that.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.760
Alright, sorry.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:45.760
But yeah, this one is, we'll start off with Alien Crush, which basically, it's a pinball game.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:52.760
It, you know, it actually seems almost like it was themed off of Alien, but you're fighting the aliens with a pinball and you have to smack them down.

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:56.760
You've got your flippers, your multi-levels, hidden rooms, different things.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.760
And you can also play two different music tracks and you have a fastball or a slowball.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:04.760
Really, it's very simple.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.760
The sequel to this was Devil's Crush.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.760
It's like pinball.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.760
It is pinball. It's just a, you know, video pinball.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.760
It's the joke.

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, really.

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:25.760
This one is, though, Devil's Crush, or as it was in Japan, Devil Crash, was the next in the series.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.760
It had an occult theme. It has demons and skeletons and everything.

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:41.760
It also is on Virtual Console, as is, yeah, as is Alien Crush is also on Virtual Console.

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:50.760
The Mega Drive version was called Dragon's Fury and that did get a release and it had a sequel.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.760
I'm playing some Devil's Crush right now.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.760
Okay.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:01.760
The Mega Drive sequel was Dragon's Revenge, which actually we just found out our cart died, so we have to find another one of it.

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:04.760
I thought this one had some cool music.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.760
But, um, Devil's Crush.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:13.760
And then there was one that we never got in America that I have actually played. I have played it at somebody's house.

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.760
I do not remember when or who, but I know I have played it.

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:20.760
And it's called Jockey Crush. J-A-K-I.

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:30.760
And it came out on the Super Famicom in 1992 and this one has very Super Nintendo music.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:44.760
Listen to a little.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.760
It's probably too violent for Nintendo standards. It does have that kind of demon-y sort of look.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:30:00.760
Well, in the background of the stage there's actually a type of ogre called a jockey.

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:04.760
It really is very heavy on the demon theme with this one.

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:09.760
But it's really fun. I actually really remember liking this game a lot.

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:14.760
And it's a little on the difficult side from what I remember.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.760
After that, now also, by the way, I did go looking for this on eBay and it was $54.

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:22.760
Which I considered.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:28.760
After that, though, we got a WiiWare version, Alien Crush Returns.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:32.760
And that one is...

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.760
I'm trying not to make noises in the microphone.

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:42.760
But it's a somewhat sequel remake to Alien Crush.

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:46.760
Which is considered definitely part of the Crush series.

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:52.760
You use the Wiimote with this one and so you can tilt the table and you have action balls.

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:55.760
Which just makes me laugh, all kinds of stuff.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:00.760
And you have a six-stage story mode and boss battles and online multiplayer and leaderboards.

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:03.760
So it's pretty neat.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.760
This game's kind of freaky.

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.760
Yeah, that one's actually really cool.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:14.760
I do remember... Actually, we might want to link the chat room on this particular video.

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:22.760
Because this is actually, I think, one of the graphically better Super Nintendo titles.

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:25.760
You see how the...

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.760
I really think it's a fantastic, fantastic game.

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.760
I just linked it there in chat, by the way.

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:35.760
But it really had a lot to do with it. It was fairly difficult, as I recall.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.760
I've only played it twice, but I do remember playing it.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.760
Alright.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.760
So yeah, it's definitely all about Crush Pinball.

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:48.760
Really, people with a Wii, you have no excuse not to...

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:51.760
Unless you're dirt poor, then why do you have a Wii?

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:56.760
But Alien Crush and Devil's Crush, you can get on the Wii.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:02.760
You can get the remake Alien Crush Returns on WiiWare.

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:06.760
Jackie Crush emulator.

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.760
I really have no problems saying get a SNES emulator and play it.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:12.760
It's really worthwhile playing.

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.760
And then, of course, there's all the Mega Drive versions.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.760
So really, there's multiple ways to play any of the games in the series.

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.760
I say go for it.

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:21.760
Alright.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.760
And I'm sure X-Tifer will agree.

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.760
Yes. There you have it, guys.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.760
He played a lot.

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:27.760
He played a lot.

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.760
Every day I came home from work, he was playing freaking Alien Crush.

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.760
Not even the remake, the old school TurboGrafx one when I downloaded it on the Wii.

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:33.760
There you have it, guys.

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:37.760
Your classic game of the week is the Crush series, starting off with Alien Crush.

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.760
Enjoy.

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.760
Or don't.

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.760
See if we care.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.760
Alright, we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.760
with some rapid fire news and some more discussion,

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.760
including our independent developers being shut out of Xbox Live Arcade.

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:53.760
Make way for the Avatar premium clothing.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:57.760
We're going to be talking about some of those changes to Xbox Live when we come back for a quick break.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.760
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:10.760
Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, July the 19th of 2009,

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:15.760
where we are taping episode number 332 of our little show that we do here every week.

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:19.760
We tape live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:23.760
If you want to join in the fun, we started taping Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time,

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.760
9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.760
We talked a lot about some of the other gaming news going on in the world in our last section,

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.760
including news about the Conduit being easy and not selling much, being easy to hack, that is.

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:40.760
We talked about the Rock Band Network, talked about Microsoft retail stores,

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.760
and now we're going to talk about some rapid fire news so quickly,

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:47.760
some stories that we're not going to spend a whole lot of time on but want to get out there anyway.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:53.760
Alright, Fallout 3 PlayStation download content didn't quite come out during June,

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.760
but now will be coming out by the end of September.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.760
This was an announcement from the PlayStation blog saying that, of course,

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:04.760
the content is releasing later than originally expected, and to make up for it,

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.760
they're going to have the first two download packs will be Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta,

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:14.760
which is the brand new, actually the last, I think, download content coming to Fallout 3.

01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:19.760
Also, something else coming to the PlayStation Network would be PC Engine games.

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:22.760
Yes, they're kind of pulling a little bit of a virtual console there.

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:27.760
Sony has announced that four PC Engine or Turbografx-16 titles

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.760
will be coming to the store actually last week,

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.760
and this would include Bomberman 94, New Adventure Island,

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:39.760
Sengoku, Mahjong, and Devil's Crush, each for 600 yen.

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:43.760
Kind of ironic that we were just talking about Devil's Crush, actually.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.760
And then finally, Sony has trademarked Ad Hoc Party in the US,

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.760
and Ad Hoc Party was a service originally only available in Japan,

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.760
and basically it would allow PSP owners to play Ad Hoc games over the internet.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:00.760
Usually Ad Hoc games, of course, obviously only can play with people in your same room.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:04.760
But now you'll be able to play with your friends over the internet, which is pretty awesome.

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:12.760
Because we used to get it on with the Ad Hoc gaming with the PSP Grand Theft Auto titles.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:17.760
That's kind of cool. So any PSP title that has Ad Hoc play, you'll now be able to do on the internet?

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.760
Yes.

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.760
That's actually kind of good. That's really good for the PSP.

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:21.760
Yeah.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.760
That's cool. But you'd have to have your PlayStation 3 on while you do it or something?

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.760
Yes.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.760
That's cool. I like that idea.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:31.760
Alright, well, let's go through some more rapid-fire news, including for our music game fans.

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.760
I'm sure you're still following BeatMania 2DX.

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.760
Well, BeatMania 2DX Empress is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:41.760
Keep in mind it is a Japanese series only. They don't come out here in America.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.760
A lot of our hardcore music game fans, they import them.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.760
But the important news about this, it is the last BeatMania coming to the PlayStation 2.

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:51.760
Honestly, I'm surprised it is coming to the PlayStation 2.

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.760
It is very interesting, and I don't know if that means maybe future versions will come out on another console.

01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:00.760
I don't know. But Konami is going to be releasing the game with what's called a Premium Best Disc set.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.760
It contains new songs and tracks, especially for the home version.

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:09.760
180 songs on this, so if you're a BeatMania fan, this is probably the version to get,

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:14.760
because I'm assuming this is just going to be going out to PlayStation 2 with a bang.

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.760
By the way, it should be noted though, this isn't the last game that's coming out in arcades.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.760
BeatMania 2DX 17 Serious, like the satellite radio, not why so serious,

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:28.760
but BeatMania 2DX 17 Serious has actually been location testing.

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:29.760
You mean like the Dogstar?

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.760
Yes, that's really where it gets its name from.

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.760
Probably most people know it as satellite radio.

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:37.760
And not for like, seriously, they're releasing a 17th version of this game?

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.760
Well, it's interesting though, I hadn't heard of any hardware upgrades,

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:45.760
so if this series is coming out to PlayStation 3, I don't know what's going to happen in the future.

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:50.760
But anyhow, BeatMania 2DX 16 Empress and Premium Best is going to set you back 7,980 yen.

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:56.760
That's 86 bucks on October 15th in Japan, so plan on paying about $99 to import it over here probably.

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:59.760
Marvel vs. Capcom is going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.760
The date was a little bit of a mystery, but now we know.

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:05.760
August 13th and $15 is how much it's going to set you back on the PlayStation 3.

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.760
That's a full two weeks, by the way, after the Xbox Live Arcade version.

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:11.760
Sad.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.760
By the way, this is also going to be the same date that a retail version of the game comes out.

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:21.760
It's $5 more, but apparently the DVD that the game comes on will have some wallpapers, a manual,

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:28.760
one month of free access to what they call Marvel Digital Comics, and 2,000 Capcom Unity points.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.760
However, it should be noted that the retail pack not confirmed,

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:35.760
but that is the date that the retail pack was rumored to be coming out.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.760
Hey, some rewards if you're a Nintendo member.

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:42.760
Finally, we were waiting for some of this stuff from Japan, but now there's some good stuff coming out over here.

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:48.760
If you're a Platinum member, you can actually get a downloadable version of Punch-Out called Doc Lewis's Punch-Out.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.760
Yes, you want to fight your trainer?

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.760
He won't just steal your bike. He will knock you out.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:02.760
And also a Mario hat. You can actually get a replica of the Mario hat that you can wear to cons everywhere up and down the coast.

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.760
That WiiWare game will be leaked out the same day.

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.760
If you're a Gold member, you can at least get the Club Nintendo original calendar.

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:11.760
It's a little wall calendar. You can get something kind of cute.

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.760
So there you go. If you're a Platinum or a Gold member.

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.760
Now, I'm not sure exactly what you have to do to qualify for each one.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.760
I imagine it just depends on your purchases.

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.760
It's just how many points you get from that.

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:27.760
You know, I was registering all my Nintendo purchases on Nintendo.com a while ago.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.760
It requires you also to register purchases to review the games that you've done.

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:38.760
You know, answer little surveys and then add other surveys available that you could do.

01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:41.760
Interesting. Well, hey, free game. Not going to complain.

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:43.760
I wonder if you have to own the original Punch-Out to...

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:44.760
No, it's a WiiWare game.

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:46.760
Cool. So maybe I'll check that out.

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.760
Because I never did buy Punch-Out on the Wii, although maybe I ought to. I don't know.

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:54.760
Well, there you go. Some rapid-fire news from me. Jamie?

01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:01.760
Well, there's a Swedish group called Opeth that said on their website that...

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:09.760
They basically said that there's going to be a PSP version of Saints Row because their music is being featured in it.

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:15.760
They're quoted in saying, expect it to hit streets around March 2010.

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.760
THQ hasn't said anything about this.

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:23.760
I'm not surprised. They were working on a PSP version of the game, I think since back to the original Saints Row.

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.760
Maybe even Saints Row 2, but I know that was coming, so that's awesome.

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.760
Well, guess what's coming back. Where's Waldo?

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.760
Aw, I was hoping it was Pet Rocks.

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:41.760
No. There is actually Where's Waldo? The Fantastic Journey.

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:46.760
So you look for Waldo and his buddies and stuff in the books.

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:58.760
And it has four multiplayer mode power-ups, so you can actually hide what you're looking for from the other people and different things.

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.760
And it's in development for PC, Mac, Wii, and DS.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.760
Will you get to find Wilma too?

01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:07.760
Yes, probably. I think you can find a bunch of different things.

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.760
I've actually seen screenshots for it, and it's exactly what you would think.

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.760
Where's Waldo? But a digital version of it.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:19.760
You know what's funny? I actually played this game, and I'm still looking for a good game.

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.760
It's supposed to be coming out in September.

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:30.760
Also, for some news on Dragon Quest IX, the rumor is that there's going to be some downloadable content.

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:45.760
It was actually hinted about from a rumor from NeoGAF that said it was supposed to be involved in that, and that it was going to be big, but oh well.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.760
You know what's funny? I would definitely think Where's Waldo is going to be the game of September.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:55.760
Screw Beatles, Rock Band, Guitar Hero 5, Halo 3, ODST.

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:58.760
I'm so glad they're making a sequel to Where's Waldo that was on the Super Nintendo.

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.760
I don't know if you've ever played this game. Fucking garbage. It is the most garbage.

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:07.760
Actually, I've played games that were less fun than Where's Waldo, Yaris being one of them.

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.760
But there are games that are really bad. Where's Waldo ranks among the worst.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:15.760
What ever happened to the good Adver games?

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.760
There were good Adver games?

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:19.760
Yes, there was. Cool Spot. Remember Cool Spot?

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:21.760
Okay, Cool Spot. Okay, I'll give you that.

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.760
That was an awesome game. Yo! Noid was okay. It was a little weird.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:28.760
I think a game out of McDonalds. McKids was a game.

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.760
I don't remember that one. There was a McKids. I know there was.

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:32.760
There was a Domino's game. Oh no, yeah, you said that.

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:36.760
There was a game for, um, uh, what else was there?

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:40.760
There was, um, one other big one I can't think of.

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:43.760
I mean, if you think about it though, half those cartoon games on NES, like DuckTales and all that,

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:47.760
were just Advers for the cartoons. Yeah. And so forth.

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.760
Why? There was another one I can't think of. It just escapes me.

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:56.760
I can't think of it. Grrr. Maybe somebody in chat will say.

01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:00.760
Although we just had a net split in chat, so maybe they won't say. I don't know. We'll see.

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.760
Or maybe they'll say and we'll never find out.

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:05.760
Exactly. Oh well.

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:11.760
So, oh well. Let's move on with some more news. Less Adver gaming and more news.

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:19.760
Yes, let's talk about buying stuff and, you know, Microsoft, we kind of knew this was coming

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.760
with the whole premium content for avatars. The Cheetos game. Thank you.

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.760
It was a Cheetos game. Really? Sorry. Yep.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.760
There was a Chester the Cheetah game. It was absolute trash, but it was out there.

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:38.760
Well, I was talking about good, you know, tie-in games and, I mean, the cool spot was awesome.

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.760
I love that game. Anyways, um, so yeah, premium content's coming for the avatars.

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:50.760
Of course, this is via the avatar store and you will actually be able to purchase new wardrobe items,

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:56.760
including one that they are showing a screenshot for, which reveals a steampunk collection.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:01.760
And they have different items that you can buy for like $2 each.

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:06.760
And this one made me kind of giggle a little bit. It's a steampunk brown jacket and bust.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:12.760
And it's funny because she's busty. So, you know, I'm assuming that they're talking about Bussier,

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:18.760
but I'm just going to leave it at bust. So you're actually buying breasts in this as well. That's awesome.

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:30.760
Um, so yeah. Or as Destructoid calls it, Microsoft Moon Dollars. I love that. 160 Microsoft Moon Dollars.

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.760
I think that's a joke because they're not really worth anything, you know?

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:34.760
I know, I know.

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.760
You just pay them to the evil empire and then hope that they release something you want.

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:43.760
Yeah, so basically you're buying more virtual clothing. And it's neat, I guess.

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:47.760
I mean, after all, I am a person that bought clothing in home.

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:54.760
But to be fair, I'm wearing that clothing forever now. I will be forever Santa Claus.

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:57.760
So that's the way things go.

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.760
Aw, Loki. You're forever Santa Claus. That's cute.

01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:06.760
By the way, I just wanted to say in chat, hey, you could do some advert clothes. Why not?

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:12.760
But we forgot the most obvious. Dark Tetsuya reminded us of the best advert game to come out in quite some time.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:14.760
Sneak King. How could we forget?

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:17.760
That was the creepiest crazy shit ever.

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.760
They need to do more of that kind of stuff.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.760
I know, they do need to do more of those. I think those were really popular, too.

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:29.760
Actually, I think they were. Were they selling at GameStop for more than the five dollars they cost originally?

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:30.760
No.

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:31.760
I thought they did.

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:35.760
No, they're not worth anything now. In fact, I just sold some of mine back because I wasn't playing them.

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.760
Did you really?

01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:39.760
Yeah, I have one left that I forgot to sell back.

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:42.760
I bought all three and I played them and I was like, wow, these suck.

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.760
So what do you think about paying for clothes on Xbox Live?

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:50.760
I probably won't do it. The only thing that's kind of interesting about this, it's not even necessarily this.

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:54.760
It's basically the reward clothing that you get for certain achievements. That's cool.

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:55.760
Yeah, I like that idea.

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.760
This I'm not even interested in. Honestly, I have never changed.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.760
Maybe a couple times changed the clothes on my avatar, but I'm kind of happy with what they are now.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.760
I don't really give a shit.

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:12.760
I tried to go in there and update my avatar and I didn't really see a lot of new stuff that I wanted to wear.

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.760
A lot of it's really out there and I like my avatar to kind of look like me, although it really looks nothing like me.

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.760
I try to make it at least kind of close.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:23.760
Dark Soccer's looks a lot like her, actually. It's kind of freaky.

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:24.760
Dan's looks like him.

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:26.760
Loki's doesn't really look like him, either.

01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:28.760
It's as close as I could get.

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.760
A little bit. It makes it look like you have a lot more facial hair than you actually do.

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.760
Yeah.

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.760
I think is the weird thing about it. It kind of looks like it. It's darker.

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.760
There's no in-between.

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.760
Yeah, that's true. That's the problem with it.

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:45.760
Anyhow, I'm cool with the reward clothes, but I wouldn't pay money for clothes.

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:47.760
I mean, what do you really use the avatars for?

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.760
Nothing.

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:54.760
On your card, your gamer card, maybe you see it in 1 versus 100. I mean, it's not that big a deal.

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:58.760
I guess there's some games, a few games that use them, but not really.

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:00.760
And who cares? No one's gonna go,

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.760
Oh my god, your avatar is poorly dressed.

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:04.760
Shame.

01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:07.760
SSJ100Matt says, Rangers jersey, please.

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.760
That's actually kind of a good point. What about these sports jersey tie-ins?

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.760
That might be kind of cool, like to wear your favorite team,

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:16.760
just like a lot of people actually do wear that stuff, right?

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.760
Well, good for them, but I'm not buying it.

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.760
Steampunk clothing? I'm sorry, my character does not need a bust.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.760
No bust for my character.

01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:29.760
No bust for you.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.760
Alright, moving on to some more news. Speaking of Xbox Live Arcade,

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:39.760
apparently there's some mumbling going around that indie games are being closed out of Xbox Live Arcade.

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:44.760
This came from a report from Screenplay talking to some concerned developers.

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:49.760
Apparently Microsoft has been dramatically reducing the number of independent titles published on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:57.760
I guess the whole crackdown on independent games is a response to folks saying that there is just too much available on the service.

01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.760
The major publishers are actually behind this saying that,

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:05.760
Well, you aren't giving enough attention to our major games because you're spending time promoting these indie games.

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:10.760
Indie developers, also a little sad because they think there are two different sets of rules for publishers,

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:13.760
one being for indies and one being for major publishers.

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:18.760
Microsoft has responded to the accusations. It took them a little while, but they did respond and say,

01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:21.760
Xbox Live is a great supporter of independent game development.

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:24.760
Xbox Live Arcade is home to some of the biggest games to come out of the IGF,

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:26.760
including N Plus, Braid, and Castle Crashers.

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:31.760
Our biggest annual program, Summer of Arcade, includes Splosion Man from the Twisted Pixel Studio,

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:34.760
and we're releasing Madballs and Babo Invasion this week.

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.760
In addition to our support of indie games on Xbox Live Arcade,

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:42.760
we've also drastically reduced the barriers for developers to distribute a game on Xbox 360 through the Xbox Live indie games,

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:45.760
and we've made development easier with XNA Game Studio.

01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:49.760
The result is that more and more indie developers are distributing their games to the Xbox Live community.

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:54.760
There are currently hundreds of games available on the Xbox Live indie games, with more coming every week.

01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:59.760
And honestly, I see the point where they're kind of being shut off, but at the same time,

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.760
if they market themselves right, they could actually release a game through community games,

01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:05.760
and it could be the same quality.

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.760
I mean, there's some really good games on there.

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:11.760
The problem is there's a lot of really crappy games on there as well, and it kind of gets buried in all that.

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:18.760
As we mentioned, part A, now you can link to your downloads and stuff like that in your blogs.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:24.760
I mean, there's a lot of ways they can market themselves, but I think they want Microsoft to kind of do the marketing for them,

01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:30.760
and maybe they should if Microsoft's getting so much money from it,

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.760
but at the same time, it's not like they're completely being blocked out of it.

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.760
Just because it's not on Xbox Live Arcade doesn't mean it can't be up on their service.

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:42.760
You know, I do think Microsoft is a little bit in the right here.

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:49.760
Certainly they're doing more than Nintendo or Sony's doing, although it does seem Nintendo does get a lot of indie games on it.

01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:54.760
I mean, yeah, they get a lot of indie games on it, but is Nintendo actually promoting those indie games?

01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.760
It's really the indie games that are promoting themselves on there.

01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:00.760
That's true. That's very true. How do you hear about any of those games? You don't.

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.760
Through the blog, Nintendo doesn't do a lot to sell those games, besides just put them on the marketplace.

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:09.760
Or, you know, send out the email, here's the stuff on the virtual console we wear. Big deal.

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:13.760
So I think to some extent Microsoft's in the right there, but at the same time,

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:21.760
what about, I thought there was supposed to be that the really big, great indie games would cross over into being full-blown Xbox Live Arcade games.

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:25.760
Whatever happened to that? Because you still can't get achievements out of indie games.

01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.760
Some of them are. I mean, like, uh...

01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:29.760
What? What's crossed over?

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:36.760
The, uh... Dishwasher. That one crossed over. There was, um...

01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:41.760
Oh, there was another one that was, like, a winner that GameCon is saying. I can't remember.

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:43.760
I know there's a couple that have crossed over, but it's pretty cool.

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.760
Oh, the Aegis Wing? That was free? Was that one?

01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:47.760
Uh, no, not that one.

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:48.760
That was before XNA.

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.760
Yeah, that was something else. There are some other ones that won.

01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.760
But I know the community games, there's a few that actually get spotlighted.

01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.760
Like, Carnivale Showtime or whatever. Remember that one I was talking about a long time ago?

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:05.760
That's actually being shown off at PAX now, and they're little indie games things, so...

01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.760
I'm almost wondering if something like that's going to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:12.760
But I don't see at the same point why they should re-release them on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:15.760
They should be able to just, like, move them over, link them or something, or... I don't know.

01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:19.760
Put achievements in them and maybe polish it a little more and then be done with it, right?

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:20.760
Yeah.

01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:25.760
But I do think that's one thing. You know, I do feel like indie games are just kind of there.

01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:27.760
I don't think they're promoted very well.

01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.760
Yeah.

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:34.760
But, you know, they are doing, I think, more to promote them than other places.

01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:38.760
I mean, I don't know if Sony is promoting them. Well, hell, they don't really have that many indie games.

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:44.760
I mean, they do have some indie games on their PlayStation Network servers, but it's not like you're getting a flood of games coming out from them.

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:52.760
It's like one or two a week, maybe, if you're getting a release every week. Whereas there's hundreds of community games.

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:59.760
Yeah. So, I don't know. I think Microsoft certainly does more for indies than most other folks do.

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:02.760
I don't think people should complain too much.

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.760
You know, I've heard this thing about, you know, there's only so many spaces that Xbox Live has to put these independent games in.

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:10.760
There's so many people developing for Xbox Live Arcade.

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:15.760
Well, maybe some of this should be developed as disc games or, you know, a step further.

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:19.760
But I guess, you know, at the same time, that's expensive. How indie is that?

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:25.760
Why not do collections? You know, the monthly pick or something.

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.760
Could be.

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:32.760
SJ100Matt brings us a story from, you know, a community developer we've had on this game a couple times before.

01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:36.760
Aaron from Snake360 paid a lot of money and tried hard to promote his game.

01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:42.760
But the fact of the matter is, many of the big sites, magazines, and everywhere else think all XNA games aren't good.

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:45.760
Yeah, that's unfortunate.

01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:48.760
And I guess in the next scene, XLink says a vote system.

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:51.760
I guess that's what's coming in the next version of Xbox Live.

01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:57.760
The dashboard, they've talked about that they're going to have voting on not only the community games, but the regular games too.

01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:02.760
Which should be interesting. Although, I don't know, I think those voting systems can be abused.

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:09.760
You know, if it's like Dig, it can be abused. It's just who's the most popularist, right?

01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:11.760
Yeah.

01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:16.760
Fear of the Claw, though, says this, the point of being indie is to find mythical treasures.

01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:19.760
The point of being indie is to get yourself out there.

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:21.760
You know, play on the word indie.

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.760
But I get what he's saying is that, you know, getting yourself out there is a big part of it.

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:29.760
So, to be continued, I'm sure. Anyhow, our show is to be continued, right, Darsarha?

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:33.760
Oh, absolutely. We do have a little bit more in the way of news.

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:39.760
Well, it's not really news. It's something that we all knew and have been saying and they finally admitted.

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:47.760
Ryota Nitsuma, who is the assistant producer on the arcade version of Street Fighter IV,

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:53.760
said that there are two fighters who were disproportionately powerful.

01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:59.760
And he actually, to quote him, says, well, first of all, I might have to apologize.

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.760
Does he involve being slightly blinded and scarred?

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:10.760
And so, actually, he said that Seth and perhaps Sagat are two overpowered characters in the game,

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:13.760
but a skilled player can still beat them.

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:16.760
I wouldn't call them overpowered other than cheap.

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:20.760
Cheap, I think, goes with the overpowered thing.

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:29.760
It's more that they are, I would say, just for skill level, that it would require a higher amount of skill level

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:32.760
than it would to fight any of the other characters.

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:37.760
The final boss should be hard, but I agree, he's way too freaking hard.

01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:40.760
Seth is a cheap-ass mofo. Yeah, he's way too hard.

01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:41.760
Yeah.

01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:44.760
I think also the boss in Tatsunoko vs Capcom.

01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:45.760
God!

01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:46.760
Oh my god, cheap.

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:48.760
The fucking Happy Fun Ball?

01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:49.760
Yeah.

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:50.760
Ugh.

01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:53.760
I agree with that.

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:59.760
End of the fight three times, which makes it three times as awesome or frustrating.

01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:00.760
However, you want to look at that.

01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:02.760
Interesting, though, that they've come out and admit it.

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:05.760
Like, a lot of times, people are like, no, my game is perfect. Nothing's wrong with it.

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.760
Yeah, we got fucked up.

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.760
Don't.

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:11.760
Well, fix it, then.

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.760
Put out a patch for the home versions.

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.760
I mean, you've got some of them online. Do it.

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:20.760
Ah, but that means you've got to do work. No.

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:24.760
We've already sold a jillion copies. Why should we bother?

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.760
Yes.

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:34.760
Well, I have to quote Dark Tetsuya saying that hopefully the Happy Fun Ball is toned down a bit for the US version.

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:41.760
And I do agree with SSU-100 Matt, Gil is still a big bitch.

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.760
Alright, let's move on.

01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:50.760
Yes. So, kind of interesting, there's now a rumor, or not really a rumor, I guess it's an internal memo,

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:57.760
Canadian retailer Zellers has put out a memo, apparently, internally in their store chain,

01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:02.760
that they're going to be no longer stocking the 80 gig PS3 core bundles.

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:05.760
That would be, of course, the system by itself.

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:21.760
It says basically that they are not to take rain checks on an advertising deal allowing customers to purchase an 80 gig core bundle with any PS3 game under $30 for $380 after a $20 discount.

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:24.760
And I'm assuming that's $380 Canadian.

01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:34.760
And apparently, the memo also says that the rain checks can't be accepted because the company cannot promise to fill them with the same item.

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:42.760
So basically saying more or less that they're not going to be available and that they're phasing them out.

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:49.760
And basically a big neon sign that says the PS3 Slim is true, so shut up with these rumor stories.

01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:52.760
In fact, I don't want any more stories about the PS3 Slim being a rumor.

01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:55.760
It's confirmed. If this doesn't confirm it, I don't know what does.

01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:00.760
It is true. It's happening.

01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:03.760
Yes. It's happening. I know it's happening.

01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:08.760
So I don't want to hear this nonsense about a rumored PS3 Slim. It's happening.

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:11.760
It's just a matter of Sony to reveal date and price. That's it.

01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:22.760
Well, you do. I don't know if this is one of the stories, but for the games conference in, I think it's in Germany, wherever, Europe.

01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:23.760
Leipzig?

01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:25.760
Not anymore. I think it's somewhere else.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:26.760
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:34.760
Anyways, games conference. Sony has booked three hours for talking their keynote or whatever that's going to be there.

01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.760
Geez.

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:38.760
Could maybe this be something that they're talking about?

01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:39.760
You think?

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.760
PS3 Slim?

01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:46.760
Why not take it to a country that's received the PlayStation a little better than the US? This is why we didn't hear about it at E3.

01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:49.760
They're waiting to announce it for Europe.

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.760
At the price point of $800.

01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.760
Let's hope not.

01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:55.760
They wouldn't get it.

01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:59.760
That would be just... Oh god. I bet something stupid like that does happen.

01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:08.760
Let me put it this way. The PS3 Slim is coming out like the sun rises every day, okay? It's without fail.

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:16.760
And if we've learned anything from Sony rumor stories, it's that most of the time they come true.

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:18.760
Especially if you hear them over and over and over.

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:20.760
It's true. I mean, if this isn't confirmation, what is?

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:25.760
Gee, we have to get rid of the 80GB bundles because we're not going to be getting any more in.

01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:28.760
And we can't ever guarantee that we're going to be able to replace them because they're just not being made anymore.

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:30.760
I wonder why?

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.760
Didn't we say a couple weeks ago on this show?

01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:35.760
Sony's going to start clearing stuff out when it's time to get a new bundle out there.

01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:37.760
When is the Eurogame conference?

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:39.760
A few weeks, I think.

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:41.760
So there you go.

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.760
It's happening.

01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:45.760
It just might not happen in the US first.

01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:47.760
Something else to think about? Maybe it's happening in Europe first.

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:49.760
No, it will happen in the US.

01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:51.760
We'll see.

01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:55.760
Well, one thing that will be happening everywhere is PopCap announcing Bookworm Adventures 2.

01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:57.760
That is coming out on July 30th.

01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:59.760
I remember Bookworm Adventures.

01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.760
Yeah, Bookworm Adventures is kind of neat.

01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:03.760
It's kind of like a role-playing game meets Boggle.

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.760
I guess is the best way I can describe it.

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.760
You make these words out of a Boggle-style board.

01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:13.760
And depending on how long you make the words and what kind of special gems and things you use in the words,

01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:15.760
you attack monsters that approach you.

01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:17.760
So it's a little bit role-playing-ish.

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:19.760
Although I wouldn't say there's a world map or anything like that.

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.760
Why hasn't this come to the DS yet?

01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:25.760
I'm actually kind of surprised we haven't really seen this anywhere but the PC.

01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:27.760
Nowhere. We haven't seen it on Xbox Live.

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.760
We haven't seen it on Facebook. We haven't seen it anywhere.

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.760
Kind of interesting.

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.760
But yeah, it's going to be released on July 30th.

01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:35.760
$19.99 is how much it's going to set you back.

01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:37.760
So there it is.

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.760
There's also a free trial available on PopCap.com.

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:43.760
And yeah, if you haven't played the original, it's fun.

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.760
And they haven't said exactly what's new about the sequel,

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:50.760
but I'm imagining more items, more monsters, more special things.

01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:52.760
More of the same.

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.760
But new and improved at the same time.

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:58.760
So that's what's coming to Bookworm Adventures 2.

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.760
That could be fun.

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:04.760
Let's get our very own Bookworm Dark Sakura to jump into the mailbag and do some reading.

01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:05.760
Do I gotta?

01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:09.760
You gotta. It's our mailbag section we do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:16.760
When you send your emails to mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com.

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:21.760
Well, the first email of the day is really short, and I really don't get it, but I'm going to read it anyway.

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.760
Sent to us by one.

01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.760
It's hot here in California, right? 108 in L.A.

01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.760
That's a spam. That's a spam.

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:28.760
It is?

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:30.760
Yeah. God damn that spam.

01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:33.760
Well, I just figured because we were talking about the heat earlier and it was the last one to arrive.

01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:35.760
It's convenient spam.

01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:38.760
Yeah. Okay, well then whatever. Fuck you.

01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:44.760
Well, maybe it wasn't spam. I'll feel bad if it is, but usually those very short emails and stuff.

01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:46.760
Is there an attachment that's an HTML file?

01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:47.760
I didn't notice.

01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:50.760
It's probably spam if it is. Sorry to the listener if it's not.

01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:51.760
Yeah, there was an attachment.

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:57.760
Here, if you want us to know that you're not spam, put OLR or Orange Lounge Radio or something in the title.

01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:58.760
Then we'll know.

01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:00.760
Please do.

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:02.760
This one comes from Deathwishing.

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:08.760
You guys talked about MechWarrior and I was wondering if you had heard of the BattleMech Firestorm. Tell us applause.

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:09.760
Yes, we have.

02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:14.760
Basically, it's MechWarrior 4 put into a huge cabinet to simulate being in the mech. Simply badass.

02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:19.760
They are rare, though, and mostly at conventions. You should buy one for the studio. We'll have a new room to put on.

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:21.760
Oh, yeah, okay. I got that money in my butt right here.

02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:26.760
We had BattleMech at Dave and Buster's in Milpitas and they took it out.

02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:33.760
Because we went for one of my last birthdays and we didn't have it there and Dan died inside.

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:34.760
It was sad.

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:37.760
I got very motion sick playing it and he kept shooting me.

02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:43.760
Back in the day, I used to play lots of BattleTech at Virtual World, which is basically the same thing.

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:47.760
They had giant pods you would get into.

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:51.760
Well, also, the next email comes from...

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:56.760
Well, I just want to say, though, it's still not the same as the real mechs we were talking about last episode.

02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.760
I want a real mech battle arena.

02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:00.760
No, like Robot Jocks.

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:04.760
Found my screener for Robot Jocks on VHS.

02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:09.760
Death Wishing in Chat says, why would they take it out? Well, because I guess it was expensive.

02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:11.760
It was expensive and not enough people were playing it.

02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:13.760
Yeah, it's expensive and takes up a lot of space.

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:16.760
Why play that when I can play skee-ball?

02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:22.760
This one comes from... You didn't actually sign it, so I'm just going to say Tranman.

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:25.760
No, from Loomis, sorry.

02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:28.760
Longtime listener, first time emailer.

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:35.760
Do y'all think we will see less third party games on PSP with the latest NPD results?

02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:41.760
It seems to sell a decent amount of hardware monthly, but the software isn't anywhere near the top 10.

02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:47.760
It's disappointing to see a game like Rock Band Unplugged sell only 35,000 units, considering the quality of it.

02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:51.760
Thanks for taking my email, and I hope to have the courage to call in.

02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:53.760
Also, Sky, please upload the podcast sooner.

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:56.760
Best wishes to Loki on the Twins and Hi Dark Sakura.

02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:58.760
Hi!

02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:04.760
I'll try. I'm really sorry about last week. I explained it earlier in the show, though.

02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:07.760
As far as third party games on the PSP, yeah, they keep selling like crap.

02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:10.760
I mean, again, what's being done to promote these games?

02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:12.760
I don't see a whole lot of great buzz out there.

02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:19.760
Although, to be fair, Rock Band Unplugged had probably better buzz than most games out there, so it is kind of sad the game itself didn't do better.

02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:26.760
But the PSP has just not, I think, penetrated the greater marketplace as the must-have handheld system for gaming.

02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:29.760
I think it's niche as college kids.

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.760
Last email.

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:33.760
Hey guys!

02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:38.760
This is my first time writing in, and I am excited and nervous, so sorry if this comes out sounding weird.

02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:40.760
You sound weird!

02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:45.760
I just started listening to your podcast this year, and it has been one of the greatest things I've ever found on the internet.

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.760
Gushing aside, listening to you guys seriously brightens up my day.

02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:50.760
That sounds like more gushing. Thank you.

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:55.760
I actually wanted to get your opinion on two topics, with the first being buying used games.

02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:03.760
Rob, I know that you're a staunch proponent for buying games and hardware because it purports the industry and gets people to keep developing.

02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:11.760
However, in my case, the money just doesn't exist for me to buy new games most of the time, so I buy mainly...

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:12.760
I think you missed a word.

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:15.760
So I buy mainly used and then new when I can.

02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:21.760
So what kind of effect do you think used game buyers have on the industry since our money isn't going directly to the company?

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:23.760
I'll end it with that one for right now.

02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:28.760
Oh, I don't think I'm against buying used games. I just don't really do it myself.

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:32.760
I don't really have a good reason why. I guess I just like kind of knowing where the game's been.

02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:38.760
I will, though. I usually buy games either when they first come out or not at all, or when they get very, very cheap.

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:44.760
I don't know. I wouldn't say I'm against used game buying. I mean, it's just part of the nature of the entertainment business.

02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:51.760
Same thing happens with DVDs. It hasn't killed the movie studios yet, so I'm not against it.

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:56.760
I look at buying used games as sort of ongoing advertising, especially if you're buying something in a series.

02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:05.760
Because who knows? You pick up an earlier game, you might like it so much that you might justify the cost of the sequel when it comes out or something to that.

02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:13.760
And on top of that, you're indirectly, I think, helping the industry because you're helping the economy.

02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:23.760
By keeping cash in, cash out, by keeping the flow of business going, you're eventually putting more money in people's pockets to be able to go out and buy new games.

02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:26.760
For lack of a better way to put it.

02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:31.760
And with all the download content that's out there now in this day and age, I don't think these companies are going to be particularly bankrupt.

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:36.760
Why do you think companies do this pay-to-unlock crap in the first place?

02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:39.760
Why do you think companies do this pay-to-unlock crap in the first place?

02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:43.760
Because it's their way of still making a little bit of money even off of used games. Think about it.

02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:50.760
Second question is this. What do you think about the concept of a semi-hardcore gamer?

02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:57.760
Wait, I've got to read this for the chat. SSG100Matt says you don't buy used underwear, but they sell it at thrift stores.

02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:04.760
People do buy used underwear. It's frightening that they also do sell used underwear and vending machines.

02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:11.760
You know, myself, I also don't put my dick next to a video game. You know what I mean? Does that make sense?

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:13.760
My second question is this.

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:16.760
Somebody else might have, though, I guess. There's your reason not to buy a used game.

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:17.760
Rob.

02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:18.760
What?

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:19.760
What do you think?

02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:20.760
I've got balls on it.

02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:21.760
Rob!

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:30.760
I'm going to do that. Before I take my games back to GameStop now, I'm going to give them one last goodbye by placing my balls on them.

02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:31.760
Rob.

02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:32.760
What?

02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:37.760
I'm just saying.

02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:39.760
Anyway.

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:40.760
Balls on game.

02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:46.760
My second question is this. What do you think about the concept of a semi-hardcore gamer?

02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:53.760
Do you feel they exist, and if so, why are they often overlooked in gaming discussion and marketing?

02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:58.760
I would say I'm a semi-hardcore gamer. I don't really consider myself a hardcore gamer.

02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:01.760
Take one look at my gamer score on Xbox Live. You'll see I'm not a hardcore gamer.

02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:06.760
I think we actually fit into that category somewhere. We're more like educated gamers.

02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:08.760
We enjoy, we're enthusiasts.

02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:11.760
I like that word a whole lot. We're enthusiasts.

02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:22.760
Yeah, but I don't think we're necessarily hardcore. I think a lot of us between our jobs, our significant others, our other hobbies, we don't have time to play a lot of video games.

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:25.760
But, you know, we play enough. We're somewhere in the middle there.

02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:28.760
So yeah, absolutely semi-hardcore gamers exist.

02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:31.760
And what was the second part of the question? Do they exist, and if so?

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:43.760
If so, why are they often overlooked in gaming discussion and marketing?

02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:49.760
That's a good question. I think a lot of times we loop them into the hardcore category. I know I'm guilty of that on this show.

02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:55.760
But I think you can't break things down, especially in media. You can't break things down into too many boxes.

02:06:55.760 --> 02:07:07.760
You usually have to have black or white, A or B. You usually don't have discussions about the hardcore, the semi-hardcore, the kind of, I like games a lot, and the people who don't really play games at all.

02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:09.760
I say we categorize.

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:18.760
Yeah, well, yeah, that's true too. And I think for a lot of people, especially the semi-hardcore gamers, if you will, they're more hardcore about certain types of games than others.

02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:21.760
And that's another reason why I think we fit in this category.

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:26.760
A hardcore gamer, wouldn't a true hardcore gamer play all games no matter what?

02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:35.760
I think that actually it has to go more towards hardcore into what you're really into. Like, I would say I'm definitely hardcore into Sims 3 right now.

02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:37.760
You know, you were hardcore in World of Warcraft.

02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:38.760
You're a hardcore nerd.

02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:39.760
So?

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:47.760
But like, I wouldn't say I'm necessarily a hardcore gamer. I don't play Madden or sports games that come out. I'm so stupid in those types of games, you know?

02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:57.760
I think it has to do with what you like best, you know? Like, for me, I play Sims all day. Then again, I also am not working and can't really do much with my hand.

02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:02.760
But like I said, when you were playing World of Warcraft and you were playing Final Fantasy XI, weren't you fairly gung-ho?

02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:03.760
Yeah, pretty much.

02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:10.760
You know, it all has to do with what you're into. Like, there's people that live on Evercrack. Oh my god. That's...

02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:18.760
All I do is play World of Warcraft. You know, you weren't that bad, but that's hardcore. There's people that live on the internet and end up like the kids in South Park at the end of that episode.

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:20.760
Mom! Bathroom.

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:32.760
But, I don't know. I think that it's not necessarily an overlooking. It's just, also you have to keep in mind that our society tends to work in extremes.

02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:33.760
You either...

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:35.760
A or B.

02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:49.760
The shades of grey would probably not be cost-effective to market to. So, they go for A or B and hope that, you know, A 2.0 is somewhere in the middle of it, you know?

02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:51.760
All those little decimals in between.

02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:59.760
Yeah, but I think that answers the question why people don't break down things further into the semi-hardcore, because it's got to be one extreme or the other.

02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:03.760
Yeah. It was awesome to get a chance to talk to you guys. Later, MoltenBrown.

02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:05.760
Well, thanks for emailing us, dude.

02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:08.760
Try not to get some MoltenBrown on your DVDs before you give them back.

02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:11.760
Oh, Josh. You're awful, Rob. Awful.

02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:14.760
Call in, dude. We'd like to talk to you.

02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:27.760
And by the way, I must say, this must be said, that was a very intelligently worded email, and I found no grammatical errors.

02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:30.760
Email of the week. A winner is you. Congrats.

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:37.760
Alright. Fear of the Claw says, why are we still discussing testicular insertion instead of video games?

02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:42.760
Actually, my last comment was referring to putting your butt on it.

02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:44.760
You said putting your balls on it.

02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:45.760
I did that, too.

02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:46.760
Unless you wipe your balls with-

02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:49.760
But MoltenBrown doesn't come from your balls.

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:54.760
Unless someone wipes your balls with their butt or something. That is really disgusting.

02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:59.760
Oh, we're laughing because it's funny and we're immature.

02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:06.760
Alright, moving on. I think we've disgusted a lot of our listeners tonight, and rightfully so.

02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:08.760
I think the listeners are ready for the-

02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:09.760
It's not my fault.

02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:13.760
The listeners are ready for the FUs of the week. They are definitely ready for the FUs of the week.

02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:24.760
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is-

02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:26.760
This is fucked up.

02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:29.760
And once you know, tonight's inspiration comes from World of Warcraft.

02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:37.760
That's right, it's an 18-year-old who lives in Greenwood, Indiana, currently being investigated by the FBI for making serious threats on World of Warcraft.

02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:46.760
Apparently, on Monday, he said in-game that he was, quote, going to board a plane at 7.30 to Chicago, and that he was going to try and kill as many Americans as possible.

02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:53.760
He left some other messages as well. Blizzard notified the authorities, believing the person was serious.

02:10:53.760 --> 02:11:01.760
The person who's been charged with this claimed that their account was hacked, but then the kid later owned up, saying it was a joke.

02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:08.760
Basically stemming from the belief that the cops would really go to your house if you make serious terrorist threats.

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:15.760
Oops! You were wrong on that one, weren't you, dumbass?

02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:17.760
Let's get into the FUs of the week.

02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:25.760
My FU goes to my hand for hurting like a motherfucker. Yes, like a motherfucker.

02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:27.760
And the reason why it hurts is because I haven't-

02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:29.760
With fucking mothers?

02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:34.760
Because I had my physical therapy, and the exercises hurt quite a bit.

02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:41.760
And also another FU to the suture that was left in my hand, and I understand why it was left in, but it's a pain in the ass.

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:47.760
A pain in the hand, really, I should say. A pain in my palm. I hate it.

02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:48.760
Done.

02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:54.760
That guy is a stupid, stupid. That's what he is. Sorry. Monkey.

02:11:54.760 --> 02:12:02.760
FU to having to volunteer on Friday, because painting a fence in 100 degree weather is totally how I'd like to spend my Friday afternoon.

02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:06.760
Just because I'm too lazy to tell them no.

02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:09.760
And FU to the weather because it's too hot.

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:16.760
My FU of the week definitely goes to the weather. Fuck the sun. I am dying. Seriously, I just need to sleep or something.

02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:20.760
I am feeling so sick right now. I'm gonna keel over and die or something.

02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:24.760
Not really, but man, the heat sucks. And what's weird, I've been indoors most of the day.

02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:28.760
I guess I was out in the car for a while driving around, but it wasn't that hot.

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:31.760
I've been drinking water. I think I'm gonna get more, though.

02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:36.760
I'm gonna sneak out during the next story and get more water, because water rocks.

02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:40.760
You want some more lemonade? I made a fresh thing of it.

02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:43.760
Okay, yeah, I want more lemonade.

02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:46.760
I love having a woman on the show who makes me food and drink.

02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:51.760
First and foremost, you have a southern woman and you're in my home.

02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:55.760
She is serving me drinks out of a mason jar, by the way, just so you know.

02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:01.760
It is natural for me to want to make sure that you guys, as my guests, are taken care of.

02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:03.760
And I appreciate it.

02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:07.760
So, if you want to blame something, blame Alabama.

02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:11.760
Well, thank you Alabama. Now get in the kitchen and get me some pie.

02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:19.760
Hey, I'll give you pie. I'll give you a mud pie from the backyard.

02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:22.760
Or maybe one of Shermie's cat pies.

02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:25.760
I'll give you a pie. 3.14159.

02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:31.760
Alright, moving on. Loki, help save our show from the completely immature path that's gone down.

02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.760
Alright, let's see.

02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:39.760
Well, I guess I could talk about this really unique game coming out called Miner Wars.

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.760
It's an MMO for the PC and Xbox Live Arcade.

02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:45.760
You know, that's something you normally don't see.

02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:50.760
It's apparently coming from a software house named Keen.

02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:59.760
And I guess their new space shooter MMO, Miner Wars, they're planning on releasing it on Xbox Live Arcade as well as PC.

02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:09.760
And it's, I guess, coming... it's supposedly coming out, I guess, autumn 2009. And that's kind of interesting.

02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:18.760
So, I don't know. They're saying that the world premiere will be August 2009.

02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:22.760
So, I wonder if that's coming out or if that's the first time we're going to see it. Who knows.

02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:27.760
But the fact that they're putting an MMO on Xbox Live Arcade would be interesting. I wonder how they're going to do that.

02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:33.760
Interesting. And the two are supposed to talk to each other? Is that what I'm understanding right?

02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:40.760
That the two games would actually talk to each other through PC people could play on and so forth?

02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:47.760
It's something that they'd like to do. And there were probably some compromises, but they're going to try to incorporate it.

02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:51.760
Hmm. Interesting.

02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:53.760
Yeah, that is pretty cool.

02:14:53.760 --> 02:15:00.760
I mean, I guess the concept's cool, though, but doesn't... I mean, like, what if the game itself sucks, though?

02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:03.760
I mean, it's kind of one of these, like, I'm reminded of the game I played this week, BitBoy.

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:09.760
It sounded great in writing, and the whole idea of an MMO that's on Xbox Live Arcade and PC is great in writing.

02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:13.760
But if the game itself kind of blows, then what can you do?

02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.760
I don't know. Not much, I guess. But I guess we'll have to find out. Maybe try the demo.

02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:22.760
I guess that's true. I guess that means there will be a demo. So at least there's that, if nothing else.

02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:30.760
All right, well, we've got one more story for you guys before we open up the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:38.760
And that story is about a game franchise I'm sure you're excited to see. Murder, She Wrote is getting a franchise.

02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:39.760
Really?

02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:44.760
It's Murder, She Wrote the game. And, Loki, I know you're saying before the show that didn't they already have these games?

02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:47.760
I think you might be getting mixed up with Agatha Christie or the, um...

02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:50.760
I thought I'd know it. Literally, I thought they had at least one Murder, She Wrote game.

02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:54.760
Well, there's that, and there's, what's the other one? The, um, Nancy Drew games.

02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:56.760
Are they getting Angela Lansbury to do The Voice?

02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:57.760
Wouldn't that be awesome?

02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:00.760
That would be fan- I love Angela Lansbury.

02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:06.760
That's right. You know what'd be great? Is a Murder, She Wrote, but, like, X-rated.

02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:10.760
You know you want to see topless Angela Lansbury, come on.

02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:16.760
Just kidding. Um, let's see. What else is happening in this game here?

02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:24.760
It's about the Summer Garden Festival that you- what is- the hell is this game?

02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:28.760
Today is the Summer Gardens Festival Gardens Competition and Tour.

02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:30.760
An event I look forward to all year.

02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:34.760
My tour group arrived at Matthew O'Neill's house in approximately 24- 1245 PM.

02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:37.760
Only to discover Matthew lying dead in his garden. Da da da da da.

02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:41.760
So basically you're going to explore a garden and try to find out who killed this person.

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:42.760
There you go. Doesn't that sound exciting?

02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:46.760
I want to see hardcore Murder, She Wrote, though. I was just joking about the topless thing.

02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:51.760
I wanted you guys to all barf in your mouth, but, like, I want to see, like, First Person Shooter with Angela Lansbury.

02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:52.760
Wouldn't that be hardcore?

02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:56.760
Murder, I Wrote. That's what it would be called.

02:16:56.760 --> 02:16:59.760
Frisbee says Banger, She Wrote.

02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:10.760
If you want to call in and talk about Murder, She Wrote or any game, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:13.760
For now, I'll open it up in studio to some last minute stories.

02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:16.760
Resident Evil 4 will be coming to the iPhone in July.

02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:23.760
This is realized after it's shortly leaked out and was pulled, but Capcom has confirmed they'll be.

02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:25.760
Hold on, we have a call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:28.760
Hello?

02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:30.760
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:32.760
Oh, this is Juan Gonzalez.

02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.760
So wait, are you the guy that emailed us earlier and I said, no, it's spam?

02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:38.760
Yeah.

02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:43.760
I take back my declaration of F-U. Sorry.

02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:56.760
Do you know how many emails we get from guys named Juan that say something about like completely off the topic and nonsensical that turn out to be spam?

02:17:56.760 --> 02:17:58.760
Hello?

02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:06.760
I don't know if you can hear me right now, but I accidentally pressed the email to everyone while you're mailing all my emails.

02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:12.760
So you are a real person and you're not trying to sell us Viagra?

02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:15.760
Yeah. I'm a real person. A real gamer.

02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:18.760
Well, okay. What did you want to say? Since we so rudely...

02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:21.760
And by the way, you're echoing really bad, so you might want to get away from the radio.

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:28.760
Since we so rudely dismissed your email, I will give you some time now to say whatever you wanted to say or ask whatever you wanted to ask on the show.

02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:33.760
I don't know. Sorry.

02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:37.760
Hello? I think he's breaking up.

02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:39.760
Connection.

02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:49.760
Okay. If you have a question, go ahead and ask. We're having a hard time hearing you. Try to get your question out there so we can answer it.

02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:52.760
Ah, fail. Sorry, Juan.

02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:58.760
But we take back what we said about you being a spammer. That's so funny.

02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:07.760
Alright. Sorry the connection was bad, Juan. But remember, guys, if you're going to call in on Skype, you can always call ECHO123 to call and test your call first. That's always a good way to do it.

02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:10.760
Hi. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:12.760
Hi. This is Spazinator.

02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:14.760
Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind?

02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:38.760
Um, you know, three really quick tips. Well, I figured whether it was at the very end of Bobby's show or at the beginning of your show proper, but regardless, you guys were talking about the Nyanko Museum with stencils that had just come out?

02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:45.760
Yes. And just to restate in case we have people listening to our show that aren't listening to Bobby's show, which shame on you. Everybody should listen to Bobby.

02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:57.760
But at the little toss we did at the end of Bobby's show, we had brought up the whole PlayStation 3 Nyanko Essentials had come out and I had wanted to check it out. I'm guessing maybe you got a chance too?

02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:25.760
Yes. In fact, I had just bought it, literally bought it until the day it came out. And in my opinion, well, I know my opinion holds any weight, but basically, for the most part, the games are basically the same as any other version that you may have gotten over the years, whether it be for the PlayStation 2 or what have you.

02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:50.760
Where the real draw is, is in the menu system they give you a card for each of the six games, and you get stamped for in-game achievements, like an Eli Apple-oriented Pac-Man or whatever.

02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:55.760
So not trophies, but kind of like a localized in-game achievement type of thing?

02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:56.760
Yes.

02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:10.760
How many games do you get for your $10? Don't you get, like, I mean that's one thing I noticed right off the bat is that on Xbox Live you have to pay like $5 for the port of Pac-Man, but it seems like on this little Nyanko collection you're getting, like what, six games for $10?

02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:32.760
Yeah, six games for $10, but what I was going to say is, where the draw is, is that with those cards, if you get so many stamps per card, like let's say three stamps on a card, then you get a trophy.

02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:53.760
You get another three more, you get certain prizes that go with the foam, like t-shirts or other items, and so on and so forth, plus you get the online leaderboards and all that, so that's probably where the main draw is.

02:21:53.760 --> 02:22:03.760
Well is it cool though, because in theory that concept sounds really cool to me, so you picked it up, I mean, have you unlocked anything at home, is it cool, does it kind of work the way you think it would?

02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:29.760
Yeah, I've got like two t-shirts out of it so far, and plus I actually, while I was at home, I actually launched each of the games from inside of home, I walked up to each of the replicas of the arcade machines that played the games, and they seemed pretty good.

02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:58.760
So that's kind of a neat little plus there, and plus, technically it's not part of the game itself, it's kind of like an interlayer within the bed area of home, there's other little stuff in there that you can unlock by playing the arcade stuff in there,

02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:07.760
like you can get collectors items, a version of solar cans and stuff like that.

02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:22.760
Well you know it sounds like I'm definitely going to have to download the game this week and check it out, and probably bring you guys a review later on, because I like the classic games, and I like having achievements, and I like being able to unlock stuff in home, I'm very curious to see how this works out.

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:31.760
Maybe I'll finally have motivation to open up the Orange Lounge Club in home too, we'll see. By the way, we got to hang up to get some more calls, but do you have anything else in your mind real quick?

02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:56.760
Yeah, one last thing, I know you guys liked anime a lot, I just checked out a new movie called Robotech the Shadow Chronicles, it's a $8 movie that you can get from PSN, and it's pretty good, if you like cheap anime movies you may want to check that out.

02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:06.760
Alright, so there you go, anime recommendation. I'm not a huge anime fan, but I'm definitely looking forward to Ponyo, because I do like Miyazaki films, so I'm going to check that out when it comes out in theaters.

02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:08.760
I will go with you Rob.

02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:11.760
Yay, good, because the boyfriend won't, because he says anime is not good.

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:14.760
Well, poo!

02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:19.760
Although he's not really dumb, he's amazing, but anyway. Alright, take care Spazinator.

02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:21.760
Alright, have a good one.

02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:22.760
Later.

02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:32.760
But seriously, I'm like, you love Disney, I'm like, Disney's putting this movie out. He says, but it's different, it's not the same, and I'm like, ah! Ah! I can't take it.

02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:36.760
Alright, how are you on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:38.760
Oh, oh my god, hold on.

02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:40.760
Okay, sure, I'll hold.

02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:41.760
Alright, it's Deathwishing.

02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:43.760
Oh, hi Deathwishing, what's on your mind?

02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:47.760
He keeps tagging, and then that popped up, and it kind of clusterfucked me.

02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:49.760
Uh huh, what's up?

02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:51.760
Um, giant robots.

02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:52.760
Uh huh.

02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:55.760
Lots of them. I'm really itching to play a giant robot game.

02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:57.760
Sounds like an awesome game!

02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.760
Tell me more.

02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:03.760
Well, no, I mean, chrome hounds. I want to play chrome hounds and stuff, but...

02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:05.760
Oh, there's too much stuff going on right now.

02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:12.760
Well, we got Marvel vs. Capcom being re-released, and...

02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:16.760
Awesome superhero hadouken fest.

02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:23.760
I know, there's so many games to play in so little time. I had no idea people were still playing chrome hounds, though.

02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:32.760
Well, I think, I see my friend playing it from Britain all the time, so I think, you know, fans are devoted to their games, like, look at Counter Strike.

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:35.760
That's true, I still see people playing Phantasy Star Universe, and I was like, wow.

02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:41.760
I have been looking at my lonely copy of Earth Defense Force 2017, thinking about going back to finish it.

02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:44.760
Did they announce a sequel for that finally, or did that ever happen?

02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:45.760
No, I wish they did.

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:47.760
No, I'm sorry to hear that.

02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:57.760
And, another thing is, are you gonna get those night vision goggles of Modern Warfare 2, so you can, like, spy around your set when it's dark?

02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:59.760
No, this, oh my god.

02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:01.760
I might not want to see what goes on when it's dark.

02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:03.760
They're not worth the price, seriously, it's just...

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:05.760
Come on, they do something!

02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:08.760
It's just a webcam with the IR filter ripped off of it.

02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:10.760
Yeah, you're probably right.

02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:15.760
I mean, if I wanted night vision goggles, which, I don't even know what the hell I'd use night vision goggles for.

02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:18.760
I guess the question is, what would you use them for?

02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:20.760
Exactly.

02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:26.760
No, um, I was just, I mean, I was just curious, I mean, when I saw, I heard night vision goggles, I'm like, wow.

02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:29.760
Like, before they announced the price, I'm like, holy crap, this must be a fortune.

02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:33.760
I went to go look at prices for, like, the ones that look exactly like those, and it was like, $3,000.

02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:37.760
I was like, holy crap, these are gonna be like, when did you go to Toys R Us to buy?

02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:41.760
It's just because Activision needs yet another game over $100.

02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:45.760
That's, there's like, how many games can we put out of there at $120 plus?

02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:47.760
It's gonna be a good game. I know it's gonna be a good game.

02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:50.760
It's made by Infinity Ward, they make the best, the good shooters.

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:52.760
I'm a shooter guy, so, but...

02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:55.760
Yeah, I don't doubt it'll be a good game, but I think Activision makes more decisions.

02:26:55.760 --> 02:27:03.760
That's like milk, that's just literally whipping it out, fapping as hard as you can, that's it.

02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:11.760
That's a great game review right there.

02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:16.760
I think some of these pack-ins are a little silly, but, you know, I guess Night Vision Goggles is certainly...

02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:18.760
Are you guys going to Comic-Con?

02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:21.760
No, there's too many conventions that go on this time of year.

02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:23.760
We went to E3, and then I'm still trying to get to PAX.

02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:28.760
Which reminds me, actually, we need to look into SAC Anime next month.

02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:29.760
Oh, really?

02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:30.760
Yeah.

02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:31.760
I think it's the same weekend as PAX, isn't it?

02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:35.760
It's coming down to Southern California.

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:40.760
As much as I would love to go to Comic-Con, I think it's this coming weekend, isn't it?

02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:41.760
It's this week.

02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:44.760
Yeah, you know what, I can't go, I have tickets to a concert.

02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:46.760
What concert?

02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:48.760
Like I tell you, I'm going to see No Doubt.

02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:50.760
Oh, it's by Etterwips.

02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:55.760
Yes, but I don't know, in all seriousness, there's so many conventions that go on this time of year,

02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:58.760
and Comic-Con isn't enough gaming for me.

02:27:58.760 --> 02:27:59.760
This issue sucks.

02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:02.760
I probably will go one of these years, probably next year.

02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:04.760
Well, this year sucks for anything gaming related.

02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:05.760
Why is that?

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:10.760
Well, just look at November.

02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:15.760
Look at it, it's this crap load of releases, and because of it, Bioshock 2 got delayed.

02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:18.760
I guess that's true.

02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:22.760
But Bioshock 2 is never coming out in November, it's coming out in October.

02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:23.760
What?

02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:25.760
That's what it was coming out.

02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:26.760
Yeah, and then...

02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:27.760
They delayed it this weekend in here.

02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:30.760
No, I know they delayed it, but it was never coming out in November, it was coming out in October.

02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:32.760
Oh, interesting.

02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:36.760
Well, I'm just saying November is usually when everyone starts shipping out all their games,

02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:38.760
and it's just like...

02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:40.760
Stop it.

02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:42.760
My wallet is...

02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:44.760
My pants are burning.

02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:48.760
DJ Tyrant and Chat pointed out that tickets to Comic-Con are sold out anyway, so that's hard.

02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:49.760
They are.

02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:52.760
Sneak in, just break a window or some stuff.

02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:54.760
Alright, Deathwish, anything else on your mind before we let you go?

02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:55.760
We gotta get more calls.

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:56.760
Giant robots.

02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:57.760
Awesome.

02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:58.760
Alright, take care.

02:28:58.760 --> 02:28:59.760
Bye.

02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:00.760
Bye.

02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:03.760
Giant robots on fire.

02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:04.760
That would be even better.

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:06.760
How about giant robots on fire?

02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:11.760
That's not good, because then that ruins a perfectly good giant robot.

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:12.760
But it's on fire.

02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:13.760
Hi, you're on Orange Launch.

02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:15.760
No, it has to be a giant robot that shoots fire.

02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:16.760
That's cool.

02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:17.760
Can I take the call, please?

02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:18.760
No, you can't.

02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:19.760
We have to discuss the giant robot shooting fire.

02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:21.760
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:22.760
Who's this?

02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:23.760
It's Misty.

02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:26.760
Hi, Misty, we gotta let you go, because we gotta talk about robots shooting fire.

02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.760
What the hell with that?

02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:30.760
What's on your mind, Misty?

02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:31.760
Not much, really.

02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:36.760
I just kind of had an announcement I wanted to finally make after trying for practically

02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:37.760
a month.

02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:39.760
Okay, what is your big announcement?

02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:44.760
That I am finally coming to SAC on at the end of August.

02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:47.760
Holy poop balls, you're actually coming to Sacramento.

02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:48.760
I knew about it.

02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:52.760
I knew too, but she wanted to wait and tell us all on the show, even though we all knew.

02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:55.760
Yeah, usually if you're coming to somebody's neck of the woods, though, you kind of give

02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:56.760
them a little warning first.

02:29:56.760 --> 02:29:59.760
I was a little freaked out at first, because I was like, oh crap, is it the same weekend

02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:00.760
I'm going to be in Reno?

02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:03.760
And it's like just before that Misty's going to be here.

02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:05.760
I know, right outside.

02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:06.760
I'm outside your door.

02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:08.760
Knock, knock, knock.

02:30:08.760 --> 02:30:12.760
So what kind of fun stuff are you going to do when you're in SAC?

02:30:12.760 --> 02:30:15.760
I don't really have any particular plans.

02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:19.760
I was thinking of going to our vehicle for the hell of it at least one or two days.

02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:20.760
Yep, you gotta do that.

02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:21.760
Oh, yeah.

02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:22.760
You gotta see some of the sights.

02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:24.760
See some of the OLR historical spots.

02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:25.760
You gotta go to our vehicle.

02:30:25.760 --> 02:30:28.760
Eat at the Brookfield's we used to always eat at at the parking lot.

02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:31.760
Oh my God, wouldn't it be cool to have like an old school night while she's here?

02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:33.760
Actually, we can make that happen.

02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:34.760
Let's do that.

02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:35.760
On a Wednesday.

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:36.760
On a Wednesday.

02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:37.760
I was hoping so.

02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:38.760
I kept hearing about that.

02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:41.760
We'll have to make that happen somehow.

02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:44.760
Unfortunately, you're not going to be here on a Sunday, though, right?

02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:47.760
Yeah, because I'm so damn opposed to flying.

02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:48.760
That's all right.

02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:50.760
But hey, we'll figure something out.

02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:52.760
We'll do a taped bit or something.

02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:54.760
We can do OLR on location at our vehicle.

02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:55.760
Oh my God.

02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:56.760
Like the old place.

02:30:56.760 --> 02:31:00.760
And remember we used to do it when we had the bit that we did over the old Beatmania?

02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:01.760
Mm-hmm.

02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:02.760
Of the hip-hop mania.

02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:03.760
Yeah.

02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:04.760
That was fun.

02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:08.760
I remember getting threatened to throw out of there by kids younger than I am.

02:31:08.760 --> 02:31:11.760
But hey, that's the way it goes sometimes.

02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:12.760
So other things.

02:31:12.760 --> 02:31:15.760
What else would be on the OLR Sacramento Historical Tour?

02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:18.760
You could go to the Target where we camped out for a wee where Jamie got recognized from

02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:19.760
the show.

02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:20.760
That was fun.

02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:21.760
That was fun.

02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:22.760
That's over on Sunrise.

02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:23.760
And then what else?

02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:27.760
What other OLR historical stops are there?

02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:29.760
We could try to make the trip to Stockton.

02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:30.760
Oh, blech.

02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:31.760
No.

02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:32.760
Blech.

02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:33.760
No, that's not what we're doing.

02:31:33.760 --> 02:31:34.760
You should show Missy the good stuff while you're here.

02:31:34.760 --> 02:31:35.760
We could...

02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:41.760
We need to see some of the crap to counterbalance and to see why the other good stuff is so

02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:42.760
good.

02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:43.760
That's true.

02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:44.760
You could go to Scandia, home of Shaft.

02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:52.760
We'll actually have to play the putt putt there.

02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:55.760
And ride the screamer, but you can't scream on it.

02:31:55.760 --> 02:31:56.760
Yeah.

02:31:56.760 --> 02:31:57.760
What the hell?

02:31:57.760 --> 02:31:58.760
I know.

02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:00.760
All this will be explained all in due time.

02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:04.760
Well, hey, let us know again as things are getting a little closer and you got your itinerary

02:32:04.760 --> 02:32:09.760
all planned out and we'll definitely meet up with you during the week and figure something

02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:10.760
out.

02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:17.760
That twit pic I posted is my incoming itinerary with all the Greyhound stops and crap.

02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:18.760
Nice.

02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:19.760
All right.

02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:21.760
Well, we are looking forward to...

02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:25.760
I've met you in person, but I know the other two haven't, so we're looking forward to having

02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:26.760
you here.

02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:31.760
I know you've been a long time listener, so this is the ultimate in fan trips to take.

02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:32.760
Indeed.

02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:33.760
All right.

02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:36.760
Well, we're going to let you go, Missy, so we can get some more calls, but we will see

02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:37.760
you soon.

02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:38.760
And I mean that.

02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:39.760
See you soon.

02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:40.760
All righty.

02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:41.760
All right.

02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:42.760
I'm excited.

02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:43.760
Later.

02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:44.760
Later.

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:45.760
I can't believe she's taking a bus, though.

02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:46.760
Oh, my gosh.

02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:47.760
That is such a long bus ride.

02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:48.760
Take a train.

02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:50.760
Well, a train's going to be just as bad.

02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:52.760
Probably a little more expensive, too.

02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:53.760
Yeah, a train's better.

02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:54.760
But I understand.

02:32:54.760 --> 02:32:57.760
If you're seriously scared death of planes, I could understand.

02:32:57.760 --> 02:32:59.760
It's going to be tough.

02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:00.760
All right.

02:33:00.760 --> 02:33:01.760
Let's wrap it up.

02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:02.760
We're going to close the Skype line.

02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:03.760
Sorry to those that didn't get through.

02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:05.760
Let's wrap it up with some last minute stories.

02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:08.760
I know you probably have a couple we didn't get to, Loki.

02:33:08.760 --> 02:33:11.760
I'm sure I do.

02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:15.760
So, continuing on with the iPhone discussion.

02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:19.760
There's a fan-made Portal game coming to the iPhone.

02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:23.760
Companion Cube is the name of the program, and it's basically Portal on the iPhone.

02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:24.760
Yay!

02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:25.760
Who doesn't want that?

02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:29.760
So, that's kind of neat.

02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:36.760
Apparently, there was an artist that worked for Google that was hiding Triforces on a

02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:42.760
bunch of their little Google splashes that they do for different events, different holidays,

02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:43.760
and whatnot.

02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:49.760
Fortunately, because of all this buzz about said Triforces, they have now been all removed.

02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.760
So, that was fun while it lasted, I guess.

02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:55.760
There is a rumor-

02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:57.760
And the artist responsible has been sacked.

02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:01.760
I don't know if that's the case, but maybe.

02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:07.760
There is a game coming to North America, Rumored, at least.

02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:12.760
Rizzoad, and that's actually a game based off the Wizard of Oz.

02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:15.760
Kind of think of Kingdom Hearts meets Wizard of Oz.

02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:18.760
And, for the DS, it's rumored to be coming out over here.

02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:20.760
Actually, I can tell you it's coming out over here.

02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:22.760
Exceeds bringing it over.

02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:24.760
It'll be coming out this fall, actually.

02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:27.760
September or October, I can't remember.

02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:33.760
But anyways, so that's kind of neat, a new RPG series maybe we can check out.

02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:39.760
And, Brutal Legends is going to be getting 4 on 4 skirmish multiplayer matches.

02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:41.760
Hot 4 on 4 action.

02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:42.760
Yes, exactly.

02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:44.760
So, that's pretty cool.

02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:50.760
I mean, hey, the game looks awesome by itself, but multiplayer, that just adds to the fun.

02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:55.760
I think we talked about this before, but apparently a fan is putting together a game based off

02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:02.760
of the Free Space Open, which I think is an open source free space engine.

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:08.760
And, basically, it's Shadows of Liet, which is a Star Fox type of game.

02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:14.760
And, this is currently in development right now, but luckily, I'm guessing at the rate it's going

02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:18.760
and the amount of coverage it's getting right now, that probably will never happen.

02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:22.760
It'll probably get a cease and desist, which is too bad.

02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:27.760
And then, of course, you know, people have been editing the PC version of Street Fighter 4

02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:32.760
that has been recently released, doing all sorts of things, such as making Cami nude,

02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:38.760
which looks retarded, and swapping people's, their move sets.

02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:41.760
I was watching Dan with Dalsim's moves, that's funny.

02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:42.760
Which looks pretty funny.

02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:47.760
And, I don't know, that's about as bad as when they were doing that with Smash Brothers.

02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:53.760
And then, a game I'd like to talk about real quick, that they had a clip of it online, looks fucking sweet.

02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:57.760
It's the Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, is the name of the game.

02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:00.760
And, it kind of has a similar art style to Potapon.

02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:06.760
But, it's this game where you fly around a little UFO, and it's kind of a shooter, puzzle, platformer game.

02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:08.760
And, it looks absolutely crazy.

02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:11.760
So, definitely check out the video if you haven't yet.

02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:16.760
It's got an awesome little kind of soundtrack to go with it.

02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:21.760
I think the actual website is the incredible, what was it?

02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:26.760
InsanelyTwistedShadowPlanet.com, I think this is actually the website.

02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:30.760
But, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, yeah.

02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:35.760
But, the guy actually that's responsible for it, he actually is an animator, and he's done a bunch of really cool stuff.

02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:38.760
So, definitely worth checking out.

02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:44.760
And then, another game that's supposed to be coming out that looks pretty cool on XNA is Vex and Silence.

02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:50.760
It's a kind of a stylized first person shooter game, and actually looks pretty polished for an XNA game.

02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:53.760
But, you can check out more information on that.

02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:58.760
It's going to span, I guess, 13 levels, and have a side scrolling shooter as well.

02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:02.760
Oh, it is a side scrolling shooter. It looks like a first person shooter from what I saw.

02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:08.760
But anyways, VexandSilence.com, and that's V-E-K-S.

02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:10.760
So, check that out.

02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:13.760
And, that's it.

02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:18.760
Alright, well, that's going to wrap it up for our show tonight, but we can't end until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:21.760
So, DarkSagra, your final thought for us tonight?

02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:25.760
They have finally put out custom hair for Sims 3. I think that's fantastic.

02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:28.760
Hurray! Loki, your final thought?

02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:32.760
My final thought is, I had something to share, but I don't have it anymore, so.

02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:33.760
How useful.

02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:36.760
I didn't set myself right.

02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:41.760
Alright, and my final thought is, oh my god, I'm seriously going to pass out from the heat.

02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:43.760
Damn you, son.

02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:44.760
Go away.

02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:47.760
Actually, it is away now. It's finally set, but don't come up again tomorrow.

02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:49.760
I hate you.

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:52.760
Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting Independent Radio. You guys are awesome.

02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:56.760
We do this for you guys and for the folks that come out and support us every week.

02:37:56.760 --> 02:37:57.760
We really appreciate it.

02:37:57.760 --> 02:37:59.760
I hope you had a good time listening to the show.

02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:03.760
If you liked what you heard, remember all we ask, tell two people you know about the show.

02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:05.760
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:07.760
That's all we really ask from you guys.

02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:11.760
And that's it. I hope you guys have a terrific week. We'll see you back here next week.

02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:14.760
We've got plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio coming back at you next week.

02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:18.760
And we will be looking at some of these games we've talked about we want to look at this week.

02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:20.760
I know the Namco Museum game I'm definitely checking out.

02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:23.760
And I'm sure plenty of other games through the rest of us.

02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:25.760
So, that's it, guys.

02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:30.760
We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio for episode number, by the way, 333.

02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:31.760
Ooh.

02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:32.760
See you then.

02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:33.760
That means we can't cuss at all.

02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:34.760
Yeah, right.
