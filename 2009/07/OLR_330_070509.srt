so they reopened it they're going to reopen it soon but it's not open yet

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,800
especially you know the worst time to close it right before the movie comes

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,760
out I know I'm a potential bummer whoops well we still have you guys in our chat

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,480
room chat that orange launch radio.com I don't know I wonder if dark Sakura might

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,160
be listening and I think her and tiara just kind of hanging out tonight they're

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,360
just kind of away so if so I expect angry text messages they shouldn't be

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,360
listening they should be gambling and seeing shows and that's right go see

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,880
Cirque du Soleil other debauchery exactly well remember what happens in

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,960
Vegas stays in Vegas so but it's it's interesting though what you guys don't

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,280
understand is that we're still at her house the studio is still at it you know

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,960
studio dark Sakura so we're here in her house when she's not here which is a

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,920
little creepy but dance here you know Dan's entertaining company right now

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,800
they're watching a movie I couldn't figure out what it was these last star

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,380
fighter thing is what it is what's happened there was maybe it looks 80s

31
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,120
horrific and yeah but anyhow you know they're they're doing their thing so it

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,760
looks like there was a fourth of july bash going on here because you can see

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,200
all the fireworks out in the street all the residue how was your fourth of july

34
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,640
I didn't buy fireworks because in California the fireworks all suck here

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,400
they're they're getting more safe and sane as the time goes on so you buy you

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,600
know $100 for the fireworks and they last like five minutes because they're

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,420
crap and so being smart and you know just plain lazy and broke this year

38
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,360
decided you know I'm just not gonna buy fireworks so we decided to go down to

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,360
our local mall that was doing a fireworks show and so we went kind of

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,360
sat on my sister's apartment lawn and watched them from there so that was

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,960
alright you know it's like whatever which is funny cuz Loki and I were at

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,880
the same show last night except I was in the actual mall parking lot which is

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,680
funny this is the unplanned we were at the same place yeah so took us an hour

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,140
to get out of that goddamn lot three minutes for us you suck well we were

45
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,960
far enough away so yeah that's what we basically did and it was okay I mean

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,520
it's just I don't know it's fourth of July how many times do you have to hear

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,680
the same songs and the same fireworks although this year they did have

48
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,200
smiley-face fireworks so that was kind of neat you know innovating a little bit

49
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,040
but yeah that was alright and then actually it's kind of funny cuz normally

50
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,080
we used to go to like the Folsom rodeo just because they have fireworks there

51
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,980
as well and actually this year the night before because they do the rodeo like

52
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,400
for you know three days or so so they like the Friday Saturday Sunday or maybe

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,880
this year is Thursday Friday Saturday anyways so they had fireworks each night

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,440
and unfortunately the second night apparently there was an accident and one

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:25,080
of the mortars shot off into the crowd burning people so don't sad I miss that

56
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,800
so oh well but um yeah that's pretty much it isn't like final destination

57
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,000
where you had a premonition to not go to know if by premonition meaning that the

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,240
rodeo sucked every year then yeah I guess well we normally don't actually go

59
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,200
into the rodeo we just watch it from outside but and they would they started

60
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,160
figuring out the people are doing that so they shot they keep shooting the

61
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,680
fireworks even lower and I mean that's dangerous enough but you know because

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,720
they go hey you gotta come in the rodeo to see the fireworks you know so we're

63
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,400
gonna shoot them ten feet above everybody it's like come on but I know

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,200
well I reading our chat room at chat that orange laundry calm looking at some

65
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,040
of the commentary a tiger claws suggesting we need someone to make olr

66
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,000
fireworks fireworks that explode into the olr logo hey I'd be down for that

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,280
except they're private I love it dark Ted see this is why can't they play

68
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,640
America fuck yeah during a show I said the exact same so did I I said the

69
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,320
exact same thing last night were you listening to the whole simulcast they

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,680
didn't yes that was crap they're playing you know god bless the USA and all they

71
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,640
you know patriotic stuff I was like they need to just bust out with America fuck

72
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,000
yeah like really something like some good rock music or something it's always

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,840
the same like crap or you know Bruce Springsteen you know even really the

74
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,400
music I mean it was just kind of sort of you know it I don't know just I would go

75
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,280
to a fireworks show like that America fuck yeah and just that the biggest fire

76
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,200
you could possibly imagine well since I like fire a lot not only did I see the

77
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,800
fireworks by the way happy 4th of July to all the other American folks listen

78
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,840
to our program if you're not American well I hope you had a good weekend

79
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,040
nonetheless and you happy Canada Day to those our friends in Canada because that

80
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,080
was just this past week as well three days before ours exactly and you know

81
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,640
what it's not really I mean a lot of people I guess celebrate independence I

82
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,040
just celebrate the fact they get the light stuff on fire exactly that's all I

83
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,040
really celebrate but I think that's something that the whole world can

84
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,960
celebrate okay some of those safe insane fireworks though are a little crazy okay

85
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,280
because like okay we really like fire so not only do we go to the public fireworks

86
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,880
show but then we came back and let off some of our private stash and you know

87
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,280
Victoria Victoria was there and she had brought her 11 year old brother like

88
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,760
stepbrother or something came came with her and he's pretty cool like we were

89
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,680
talking video games and stuff he thought it was cool that I played Xbox and had a

90
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,200
show on the net and all that stuff and he likes video games and stuff I guess

91
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,320
him and Victoria actually bought at one of the safe and stay insane stands it's

92
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,000
called a bazooka and it is literally a firework that you sit on your shoulder

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,560
and you're like the fuse on the other end and it shoots off like a masses

94
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
amounts of color and sparks and I'm like okay wait a minute isn't this something

95
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,160
that you like sit on the ground and do this whole thing when they're like no

96
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,640
the lady at the thing told us that you you all put it on your side like a

97
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,480
bazooka or is this a video game show a super scope six it's super scope six of

98
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,080
fireworks you have to literally like put it on your shoulder okay like I thought

99
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,560
it was going to be a pathetic little display like a sparkler or something no

100
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,840
this thing was a like it didn't last very long it was only about like 30

101
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,780
seconds but it shot off like monsters of color and sparks like so much that the

102
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,600
kid got afraid and was started backing up a little bit and we were all actually

103
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,800
kind of like um this can't be good but he was like scared to hold it and all

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,520
this stuff we were like just you and Victoria was just like you fucking bought

105
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:56,560
it you fucking hold it this is great so you know teaching them young so yeah and

106
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,720
it was it was cool we set it off and it was it was it was very amusing at least

107
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,960
for those 30 seconds the other thing we did during 4th July is we were watching

108
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,480
Comedy Central all day where they had a marathon of like stand-up comedy which

109
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,760
is awesome so there's a bunch of comedians and they're like oh yeah

110
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,760
that's that guy that I wanted to see you know it's those pretty much it yeah we

111
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,120
don't have any unfortunately at our club we don't have cool things like Roman

112
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,720
candles here yeah he's asking if I'm talking about Roman candles no you don't

113
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,960
point this wasn't something you point upwards you hold it like a bazooka or a

114
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,620
super scope six and it shoots sideways but what's shooting out looks like the

115
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,720
type of thing you would see in a normal safe and sane firework I don't know how

116
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,960
to describe this for people not in California but like you know the just

117
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,120
the little sparks to go you know like the little little tiny flames of red

118
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,920
green yellow it's not what it used to be like sparklers don't really sparkle

119
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,000
anymore they're just kind of a little flame and yeah they look like colors

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,240
flames sparks coming out but you know we basically use the sparklers and I was

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,920
just like you know pucks and basically but yeah I mean I've seen my friend's

122
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,120
dad is a firefighter and or fire chief actually and he gets you know he

123
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,720
confiscates all the fireworks conference gates yeah unquote stashes

124
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,800
them for his own fireworks and my brother was a firefighter I know all

125
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,480
about confidence so they have you know they had like little boxes that are

126
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
mortars and stuff you know just like stuff that if you were in any other

127
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,920
state you'd probably be able to get and then of course every year their thing is

128
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,040
that they try to light off more and more ground flowers each year so like last

129
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,040
year I think they lit off like 400 ground flowers I mean it was the funniest

130
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,960
we saw it and now I have to describe for those don't know the ground flowers I

131
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,080
mean everybody's probably seen these even even in places where fireworks are

132
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,960
legal these things are cool like you light them and they go and they start

133
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,000
like red and then they turn green and they shake on the ground and spin around

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,840
you can't get those anymore huh did they finally ban them no I don't think so

135
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,000
really we didn't have any this year they're around okay yeah so they have

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,920
those and they try their thing was as a you know big group or party and stuff

137
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,240
they tried to light off more and more each year I think the year we went they

138
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,200
were doing like 250 I mean it's been getting more and more this was many

139
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,860
years ago but it was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen it literally was a

140
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,680
pile that they meticulously you know stacked up and you know tide fuses

141
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,940
together and all sorts of crazy stuff and it was the loudest buzzing just like

142
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,480
the whole street is just full of smoke and like lights in it it's so like

143
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,880
breathtaking you just can't stop you have to like bust out laughing because

144
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,960
it's the most ridiculous thing you've ever used wanted to cry it was so

145
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,540
amazing it was it was crazy I wish we had video of it but it's that sounds

146
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,320
like you know how like you'll spend like all day setting up dominoes for just

147
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,280
that one minute thrill when you knock them all over basically exactly what it

148
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,080
sounds like to me it's gotten so big now that like you know they literally have

149
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,720
like four or five piles of this stuff and it like by the time it's done it's

150
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,520
just like there's like a block radius of justice ground flowers just left it the

151
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:20,920
whole ground flower bomb pretty much it's awesome nice that's amazing a lot

152
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,240
of fun

153
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,720
alright well hey we're at we talked a lot about fire and fireworks and I'm

154
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,080
sure the kids love that but let's talk about video games a little bit with how

155
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,040
was your gaming week

156
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,400
Loki how was your gaming week I didn't play much I played of course the usual

157
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,160
hacked Grand Theft Auto 4 and yes I have people requesting you know that I play

158
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,640
with them and stuff online I can't play with you guys online because our new

159
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,720
systems are modded so we have a special version of it and it just wouldn't work

160
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,920
I mean we have items that I've created and who knows if it crashed the game if

161
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,600
I tried playing with you guys most likely you would have you be seen as

162
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
firing off all these crazy weapons and you wouldn't be able to do that because

163
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,040
it's just the way it works so you know not to and also the other thing our work

164
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,200
games we don't invite other people in it's just the four of us or three of us

165
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,160
or whoever's playing that's just the way it is but um so it's not hurt not that

166
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,240
I'm trying to ignore anybody I'm just saying that people have been asking me

167
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,320
to invite him it's just like yeah I can't do that so sorry

168
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,280
anyways so beyond that stuff it's just getting crazy just you just stuck up

169
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,440
just a minute you just stuck I'm not stuck up I play with other people but

170
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,840
um let's see here then also I've been playing I tried angry berry I finally

171
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,680
got to work I found out that it actually wasn't the game broken it was actually

172
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,920
our internet at work is kind of it's got a weird firewall on it they have us was

173
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,000
the 80s 86 3000 or something like that it's some weird web filter that they

174
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,440
have well they've only like unblock certain ports or something so for

175
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,880
whatever reason like we can play live but like the community game stuff

176
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,080
doesn't work because community games whether you guys know it or not you

177
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,040
actually have to be connected to live to use any of the community games even if

178
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,520
you bottom and they're on your system you have to connect to live in order for

179
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,120
it to work that's kind of like what happens with an Xbox Live arcade game if

180
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,520
you're not on your own console that you bought it on the air under your account

181
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,640
it'll kind of check live first exactly sounds like that but you know I these

182
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,680
are the consoles I bought it or it's the games I bought on this console so it's

183
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,560
kind of annoying so for you know I didn't realize this but at work I was

184
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,200
getting this weird error message and it's weird too because other community

185
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,280
games I've gotten have worked just fine but maybe I wasn't like maybe they

186
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,760
changed something or whatever because I played a carny vale and that was kind of

187
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,600
fun but anyways so angry berry for whatever reason didn't work at work but

188
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,920
then I tried it again at home I redownloaded and everything and it works

189
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,280
fine so I played a little bit of that and that game is absolutely crazy and

190
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,600
very very hard and just absolutely ridiculous with you know smashing old

191
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,400
women with buses and all sorts of crazy stuff we talked about this a few shows

192
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,080
back by the way if you have no idea what he's talking about yeah it's a fighting

193
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,200
game where you are Barack Obama yes you're very you're Barack Obama and it's

194
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,520
got it's got like all sorts of crazy like enemies and stuff and all sorts of

195
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,120
political references so it's great so definitely we're checking out things

196
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,040
only like 400 Microsoft points so I think it's worth that I would like to

197
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,960
see a game like this but with Sarah Palin I think it would be very funny

198
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,560
especially now that she's not going to be the governor of Alaska anymore if

199
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,000
you've been watching the news at all this week I you know what else is you

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,520
going to do in her spare time but save save the world from crime that would be

201
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,240
funny and then other than that I actually played some more fuel this week

202
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,000
and tried the online stuff you know there really is no one online I did see

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Rob online but you know it just so happened like he'd be in a race when I

204
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,560
was doing the free mode and then I'd go into a race because he was you know in a

205
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,760
race and then he'd be doing free mode and it's just this wasn't working out

206
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,280
but I mean I don't even know how exactly that works if it's like fable to where

207
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,480
like I have to drive to your location actually find you I'm sure you do

208
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,560
because that would be annoying and I don't know where anybody is so oh well

209
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,520
but the game is fun and you know now that I figured out how to cheat and

210
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,080
teleport different spots on the map to get different vista points and stuff it

211
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,560
makes it nice and easy but there was funny though because the first section

212
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,200
of the game the first little region that you're in I didn't realize that I've

213
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,280
only done one page of the challenges I'm like what the hell oh why is this

214
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,200
challenge say I'm not done I'm like I've done all six of them I'm like oh there's

215
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:41,280
a page over whoops damn it so I went by the way that happens with races too in

216
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,400
the second area in tsunami zone or whatever it's called there's six races

217
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,320
not three so just watch out for that okay why can't we put more once you get

218
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,800
fooled I don't know why they did it that way but it's important and as the tsunami

219
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,600
reef or what I think it's what's called tsunami reef because those races not

220
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,560
only will unlock you get your challenge Doppler the livery Doppler but you also

221
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,840
get three cars that are new cars when you run into them you unlock a vehicle

222
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,600
so it's important to play all those races if you want to get all the

223
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,400
vehicles yeah I do because I'm actually tired of driving as the one side I did

224
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,400
all those unlock codes for different vehicles nice they're kind of it but I

225
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,000
like the clothing so I kept the clothing but um yeah it's so fun and actually you

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,740
know I really wish I had more time to play because I would be playing it a lot

227
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,520
more but I've been busy with that and other things yeah and still haven't got

228
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,200
a chance to play Wii Wii Sports Resort let me I get to this question from Jay

229
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,240
rod in chat because you were talking about angry berry and it kind of brought

230
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,760
up community games Jay rod wants to know are those community games free to

231
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,180
download they're free to demo yes but they do cost money if you want to

232
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,520
actually buy the registered version it's just like Xbox Live Arcade so the

233
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,840
community games tend to be a lot cheaper and I mean the lowest price on the

234
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,640
community games 200 Microsoft points and another thing too I haven't really gotten

235
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,200
a chance to play around to get the new like kind of game making program kodu is

236
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,320
actually out now and 400 Microsoft points five bucks for a game that you

237
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,840
can make games in and send them to your friends and share stuff like that

238
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:21,560
excellent deal so definitely check that out very cool anything else for your

239
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,960
gaming week that's it you know I don't really have a lot to share with my

240
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,480
gaming week I haven't really played a whole lot of new games I'm almost

241
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,160
embarrassed to admit I've been playing a lot of Facebook games this week I know I

242
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,640
know I should hang my head in shame all the credibility I had as a gamer is kind

243
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,080
of shot but I don't know I've just been addicted to those crappy little Facebook

244
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,880
games I've been oh god I don't even know if I really want to admit this but I've

245
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,400
been playing one called sorority life sorority yes shut up it's like oh yeah I

246
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,640
did it's like something it's like mafia but it's a sorority fight it's something

247
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,720
my boyfriend got me hooked on but it's it's got all these little mini games to

248
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,840
like bejeweled and stuff I think here's what it is you know how I quit the MMOs

249
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,480
I think I have this inherent need to be leveling something like I'm leveling a

250
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,400
character in this stupid-ass sorority life game like all of three I don't know

251
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
I need to I do I need to go play something else like that but keep in

252
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,600
mind also I have a roommate so I can't have the TV whenever I want a period so

253
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,920
keep in mind that's a big reason why I don't always play like Xbox games and

254
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,160
you get a VGA cable for making for my monitor yeah I'm maybe I do maybe that

255
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,520
is something I did my computer all the time that's all I really play my 360

256
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,280
well here's something else I don't want to get teased too much I didn't play all

257
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,280
those Facebook games all week although I did play some more legitimate things

258
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,160
like bejeweled and text twist and they have UNO on Facebook now I don't know if

259
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,280
you're aware but they have UNO on Facebook that is similar to the Xbox

260
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,520
live one except you instead of seeing like webcams you're seeing people's

261
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,200
little Facebook icons and you're in a little chat room so you can actually

262
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,880
play UNO so you know I was checking a lot of that out this week but I also got

263
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,920
a new laptop this week fries on a really good deal on laptops this weekend

264
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,100
because it's 4th of July and all that stuff so I actually went and got a new

265
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,960
laptop it's a Toshiba so it's not a bad brand 2 gigahertz machine 3 gigs of RAM

266
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,400
separate video card inside it's not like an onboard video it's got a separated

267
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,240
video card $399.99 for his laptop I know it's a sweet deal but what's also sweet

268
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,080
about it here's where the rest of my gaming week comes into play because now

269
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,840
it's back to a 32-bit operating system since I don't have so much RAM or what

270
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,080
have you I can play game tap games again so I actually spent some time playing

271
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,520
civilization 4 because I missed it and that was one of the big games I would

272
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,640
play through game tap so I know I let out a lot of game tap hate on a previous

273
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,760
show because it would not work with my Windows Vista 64-bit but now I'm running

274
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Windows 7 and yeah I installed the release candidate that we all got at e3

275
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,480
I decided you know what since I have a new laptop kind of like a fresh start

276
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,280
when better time to upgrade my OS so I upgraded to Windows 7 I haven't played

277
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,960
enough games on it yet I'm not familiar enough with the operating system yet I

278
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,320
do like it seems to be a faster version of Vista but without all the stuff that

279
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,920
made Vista so annoying like it's not asking me like 50 times I'm saying there

280
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,120
are you sure you want to install this so-and-so wants to access your computer

281
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,480
it's only done that when I've installed stuff otherwise it leaves me alone and

282
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,720
it's it's so much easier to turn off the warning messages and stuff so that was

283
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,960
one big improvement I noticed right off the bat I do think Windows 7 will be

284
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,120
better than Vista that's for sure better than XP I don't know still too

285
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,880
early to tell I do like though here's the one huge thing I noticed if I can

286
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,960
talk operating systems for a minute instead of having all your windows at

287
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,720
the bottom like you know how like right now you can see okay I have Firefox open

288
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,920
IRC Adobe Audition the mixer and all this stuff that you see there okay

289
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,280
instead of it that imagine that what would happen is that you'd see the

290
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,480
little icon in the quick launch bar that you had on XP and it's just like it's a

291
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,880
different color like the button looks raised because you have windows open and

292
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,960
then when you hover over the raised button you see little previews of all

293
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,040
the windows that's another huge change in Windows 7 so you save so much real

294
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,280
estate on the bottom of the screen with all your windows open at once that was

295
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,800
pretty cool so I'm noticing little things here and there but being able to

296
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,960
play all the old computer games I was missing from not having game tap work on

297
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,840
a newer OS was was kind of nice so that's cool I'm happy about that

298
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,040
rama in our chat room says Windows 7 release candidate will expire after a

299
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,000
year yes I'm aware that the two-hour shutdowns begin in March 2010 but look

300
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,280
that's March 2010 still a heck of a long ways away and apparently my laptop comes

301
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,240
with some type of free upgrade to Windows 7 anyway because I have like

302
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,000
Vista premium came with it I don't know they were telling me this at fries like

303
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,280
if I send them there is a thing that you can up it's it's gonna either be free or

304
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,480
a small fee I wouldn't even mind paying a small fee honestly but I you know if I

305
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,800
contact the manufacturer I has held on to my receipt so I can get the seven

306
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,960
free cuz I'm I'm sure I will prefer seven to Vista I can already tell I

307
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,360
prefer seven I just feel weird if I bought an operating system so I'm gonna

308
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,280
hold out for the pirated version look if your laptop comes with it for free I

309
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,600
mean oh yeah you know so I'm entitled to it right it's not a piracy thing it's it

310
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,240
came with my laptop no I'm thinking about my computer that's you so there

311
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,760
you go it's not that I don't want to pay for it it's just I don't want to pay for

312
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,160
it yeah Rama and chat says don't worry you get a free upgrade and let's see

313
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,960
Tiger class says the deals you see about home being 49 and professional being 99

314
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,120
it's for those about pcs with a Vista that's interesting because that means

315
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,600
that that means it's kind of like an apology for Windows Vista Rama and chat

316
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,240
goes on as of last Friday when you buy any computer you get a low cost or free

317
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,440
upgrade for seven that's awesome I picked a great time to upgrade didn't I

318
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,600
whoo nice so I was happy with my laptop purchase I'm telling you if you're in

319
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,000
the market for new computers right now that's a great time especially the

320
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,840
economy being the way it is and everything people or the you can find

321
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,800
some dirt cheap sales you know I've and I believe me I found those netbooks

322
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,760
tempting for like 200 250 dollars but seriously just spending another like

323
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,480
150 getting a nice nice system I'm very happy with my purchase and think about

324
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,360
it that is the cost of a PlayStation 3 and only 150 dollars more than the cost

325
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,800
of a PSP go I was listening to a old episode or a lot when I say old I mean

326
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,240
just a couple weeks old we were kind of in that debate about the PSP go and how

327
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,840
Sony is absolutely being idiotic with their price points it's what's killing

328
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,640
that generation 49 I mean the 249 can buy you a freaking laptop and we talk

329
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,040
about how you know PSP's are cool because they can do music and games and

330
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,320
you know kind of the thing all the things that a laptop can do well guess

331
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,720
what Sony a laptop costs as much as you're charging for your PSP go I this

332
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,880
whoever that was it's so frustrating because it's not that they're bad

333
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,400
systems it's just the Sony's getting it's just like when I remember the

334
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,960
PlayStation 3 everybody was like you know they're showing you know the system

335
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,400
everything and it was like yeah this looks awesome this is gonna be sweet you

336
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:09,720
know and then they're like oh and it's gonna be 599 you're like dah you stupid

337
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,120
you know what at least I'll give them the fact that they did have blu-ray

338
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,720
which at the time was an expensive technology it was fine yeah hella

339
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,680
fucking risky for them because at that time a winner had not been declared in

340
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,160
the HD DVD blu-ray war but to their credit and I'll give credit where

341
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,320
credits do I give Sony a hard time and I'll give them a good time when they do

342
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,920
things that are right they they were right they they were lucked out with

343
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,700
this blu-ray thing they want to say lucked out but they won out with this

344
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,600
blu-ray thing and that's gonna be a huge asset to them as this generation

345
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
continues I think you will see more people that decide oh I need to get a

346
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,360
blu-ray player why don't I just get a PlayStation 3 just like people said last

347
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,960
time I need to get a DVD player well I'll just get the PlayStation 2 because

348
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,760
it plays games you know my significant other has a PlayStation 2 doesn't play

349
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,720
like any video games on it uses it as a DVD player there are a lot of people out

350
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,760
there like that like that that will buy it as a player but kind of knowing

351
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,680
that oh well you know if I wanted to play games on it or had somebody

352
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,840
entertain I could it's good but see that's the thing though is that's good

353
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,440
to increase your install base but when you look at you know something like that

354
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,600
then think about all the people that did buy it for mainly a blu-ray player their

355
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,180
number is already you know for being in third place aren't that great and if you

356
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,260
take off you know X amount of percentage of that you know saying that these

357
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,520
people are only going to be using it for mainly a blu-ray player that's really

358
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,660
not good you know and they were kind of hoping that they would get a little bit

359
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,940
of a bump from you know people buying it as a cheap blu-ray player but it's not

360
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,440
working out for them Marissa con gusto and chat makes an interesting comment

361
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,720
chat that orange laundry calm if you want to join us live on this Sunday

362
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,060
evening as we tape at all games calm Marissa says I was talking about the

363
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,800
economy with new game prices the other day with a friend the prices have gone

364
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,760
down over the years recollecting that if a new game was $60 in 1993 for me but I

365
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,820
still wonder if the new titles can command the same opening price with the

366
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,080
unemployment rate skyrocketing well and somebody followed up in chat with Sony

367
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,420
sure hope so I to some extent they do say that even in a recession people will

368
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,600
not neglect their entertainment I mean look at movies transformers did

369
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,820
extraordinarily well at the box office even with the fact that tickets cost

370
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,480
like 1025 a pop now me movies are freaking expensive but transformers had

371
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,680
what the second best weekend only to the dark night I mean it's still huge

372
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,320
business you know it's there's a lot of freaking money a lot of people want to

373
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,100
see a movie a lot of people aren't willing to sacrifice you know

374
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,280
entertainment I mean they've made cuts throughout their life you know in

375
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,880
different aspects of everything and they want a little bit of a kind of a treat

376
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,400
for themselves for you know cutting to suffer yeah pretty much yeah I mean and

377
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,960
you know they can still afford to go to movies it's just you know what you got

378
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,000
to be smarter about if you really want to pay you know they go see a movie

379
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,840
don't buy the popcorn and soda there go see a matinee there you go you save

380
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,280
yourself a ton of money because it's just that the you know concession prices

381
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,360
are so expensive and the movie prices are pretty or go to the drive-in damn oh

382
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,720
yeah and save it the drive-in with the double features and bring it in your own

383
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,000
crap in the backseat and everything and hell yeah yeah the pride I'm surprised

384
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,360
the drive-ins do not thrive in an economy like this well you notice

385
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,720
member they are talking about closing the drive-in that we have in Sacramento

386
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,760
here for a while I always do they are every year they're talking about oh

387
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,840
they're talking about let's put in a 25 screen theater well because they could

388
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,120
charge more exactly that doesn't mean they'll have the business for fixing the

389
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,600
drive-in charge more for that charge a little more anyway sorry we're getting a

390
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,600
little bit off topic but let's see alpha kenanagram and Chad is hoping

391
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,640
believing the Ars Technica mole is right about the ps3 price drop in ps3 slim

392
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,360
since a lot of great 80 gigabyte bundles are going to sell with Wally LBP a

393
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,720
little big planet bundle and Metal Gear Solid 4 Killzone 2 bundle I don't know I

394
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,360
guess we'll get into some of the Sony news in just a little bit here when we

395
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,000
get into the news tonight but I I wanted to say though quickly about Sony and the

396
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,200
PSP go I think whereas people are willing to make sacrifices to their

397
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,760
entertainment there's a limit and I predict as I'm sure many of you do but I

398
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,440
I'm willing to kind of put it all out there I fully predict the PSP go is

399
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,800
going to tank and I'm not talking about like not not it's not just going to not

400
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,040
sell it's going to not sell horrifically like it is going to be an embarrassment

401
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,160
to Sony as I would predict the PSP go and it's all based off that price point

402
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,200
because when you put one of those puppies on the shelf next to a Nintendo

403
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,960
DSi that's only or an iPhone 40 or an iPhone that's $99 I'm sorry what does

404
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,840
Sony have to justify that PSP go with not a lot and I'm sorry fanboys I know

405
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,560
you got your games and I know you got your multi stuff that you can do in

406
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,000
there I'm sorry it is not just now they did say and then you know I know this

407
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,160
doesn't justify anything they did say that the processor is going to be four

408
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,880
times you know it's going to be a little bit faster so would be the average gamer

409
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,320
does not give two shits I didn't say they're not going to sell any of those

410
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,000
things well yeah there's plenty of Sony fanboys that'll be forking over the

411
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,720
money but it's going to be an embarrassment they're going to have to

412
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,200
cut the price and make they're going to have to that they will there will be

413
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,800
damage control by the even once it seems to be out like August October well then

414
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,200
by then they won't do they won't be able to fix it in time for this year's

415
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,440
holidays but next next year for the holidays it's going to be a well

416
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,160
especially you know they've got you know the PSP 3000 still out there now if you

417
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,960
really want to PSP you know if you think about it huh let's see here I can buy

418
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,920
this PSP system that's $100 cheaper and you know get 16 gigabytes of storage or

419
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,280
whatever for that for probably a lot less than $100 so there you go you save

420
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,720
money right there amazed at suman chat asks sky tank worse than the GBA micro

421
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,920
I think actually that's not a bad comparison because that was a dumb idea

422
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,680
to you know I think it was one of those things is like oh how cute you know

423
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,120
little tiny gameboy but like in practicalness you know come on those GBA

424
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,200
micros are a little silly I think this is actually worse because the reason why

425
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,000
is you're you're basically saying to your retailers okay you need to sell

426
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,040
these and the retailers are going well why because then this is basically a

427
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,700
system that you can only download games for it and you're not letting me sell

428
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,200
Neil vouchers for these games and stuff so why should I push your product and

429
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,520
that's really what's come down to it like I have some my cell through stores

430
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,120
that I deal with they're like I'll bring in a couple because people are going to

431
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,600
want them but that's it I'm not going to you know push these things at all

432
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,880
because why should I they're cut into my sales yeah I this is just going to be an

433
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,160
embarrassment it's going to set digital distribution for games back a couple

434
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,640
years single-handedly because then Sony's going to blame it on that that

435
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,360
people aren't ready for digital distribution no blame it on your price

436
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,800
and the fact that it's a system without a UMD drive should be cheaper see what

437
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,280
happened with the price you know before with the PlayStation 3 hello come on I

438
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,360
mean did you not learn from that at all I want to spend this whole show bitching

439
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,200
about Sony's price point because we've done it before but it's just it's just

440
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,520
frustrating as somebody who who wants to see the good in Sony and wants to see a

441
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,480
lot of the good stuff they have on the horizon to just watch them literally

442
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,480
literally take out a gun pointed at their foot and pull the trigger to watch

443
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,000
them literally do this in front of our eyes is frustrating as a gamer I'm sorry

444
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,120
as someone who tries very hard to see the good in Sony yeah anyhow let's get

445
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,600
into some gaming news I don't really have a lot for housekeeping tonight

446
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,000
visit us on Twitter at olr send us emails at mailbag orange laundry calm etc

447
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
etc Loki go ahead yes so actually I was gonna say you know we can talk a little

448
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,360
bit about those bundles that they had there's actually two different bundles

449
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,440
that are available now for a gig system which is kind of funny because they're

450
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,080
like kind of clearing them out you know because everybody thinks oh they're

451
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,400
gonna come out with some new 160 gig systems or something like that that

452
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:15,680
kind of goes back into what the Ars Technica mole said that the like a

453
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:23,000
slimmer ps3 will be coming out actually as soon as August and there's a Taiwanese

454
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,640
firm that said they've been awarded the manufacturing contracts for this ps3

455
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,880
slim system and apparently you know Engadget Chinese they reported that the

456
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,840
two Taiwanese manufacturing companies have been awarded contracts to build

457
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,440
Sony's new streamlined ps3 and according to udn.com half the orders have gone to

458
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:53,080
Taiwanese group Foxconn and the other half have gone to pigotron wasn't a

459
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,640
Taiwanese lawyer that tried to cease and desist the early images of the ps3

460
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,520
box to yes it was and apparently you know these were the manufacturers that

461
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:11,560
have I think manufactured the original ps3 so it makes sense and you know they

462
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,200
also said that the timing makes sense the rumor that it's gonna be released

463
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,200
in August because in Japan they actually have more console sales during the

464
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,480
summer as opposed to you know the holiday season for you know us in the

465
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,920
United States and Canada so you know it makes sense maybe that they're trying to

466
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,680
sell off all these you know ps3 80 gig systems to kind of clean out their

467
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,400
inventory and they're doing these kind of bundles to you know push out some

468
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,760
more systems to kind of make space for this new system which who knows maybe

469
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,960
going into our next story you know with the whole emulation thing so tell us a

470
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,520
little more about the emulation thing then so if you're gonna if you're gonna

471
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,880
open that worms let's talk about it definitely I mean if you think about okay

472
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,800
why would I need a ps3 you know slim system when I have you know ps3 well

473
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,160
there's rumors now that they may be you know bringing back the emulation this is

474
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,240
coming from the fact that there has been a new patent filed I guess back in

475
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,960
December you know I'm talking about full emulation of the emotion engine and the

476
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,440
motion engine was the chipset that they had in the PlayStation 2 it's basically

477
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,560
what you had in the no launch ps3 systems that allowed you to play the

478
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,000
PlayStation 2 games and then of course they took out one of those two chips

479
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,320
for the 80 gig system that was with Metal Gear Solid 4 and they were doing

480
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,440
some of that with software emulation then later on they took out all the

481
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,160
chips and so now you know you have no emulation but you know like they did

482
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,000
with the PlayStation 1 PlayStation 1 is completely you know software emulated

483
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,960
and you can play your discs and you can download PlayStation 1 games so you

484
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,080
better believe it that they're probably gonna have PlayStation 2 game downloads

485
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,880
here's my thing though are they really gonna you know patches in allow

486
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,000
everybody to play their PlayStation 2 games or are they just gonna really

487
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,040
strictly leave this as software emulation for the titles that are

488
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,880
downloaded so that you have to buy your games again do they want to piss me off

489
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,400
or not is basically the question that's out on the table I would hope if the

490
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,560
emulation is being built in there to play these old games and put them out

491
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,880
there on the service which makes a lot of sense as to why why now why this is

492
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,000
happening especially with digital distribution being so big maybe the PSP

493
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,440
go will leave because if this thing has a faster processor right you said the

494
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,840
process for maybe these PSP goes are gonna be armed to play the PlayStation

495
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,080
it's not gonna work because the the patents actually for the cell processor

496
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,600
to interpret okay so it's never mind you know unless they're shoving the micro

497
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,640
cell processor in the PSP go which not gonna happen all right so that train to

498
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,760
rail never mind so but if they're gonna do this whole thing with you know the

499
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,240
PlayStation 3 it's obvious that they could easily open it up so that image

500
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,640
is just like PlayStation 1 I can put a PlayStation 1 disk in my PlayStation 3

501
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,760
and play it there's no I mean people forget it is backwards compatible

502
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,400
PlayStation 1 but just not PlayStation 2 which you know is is noticeably missing

503
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,640
from the newer models anyway which I think most people have I don't have a

504
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,440
model I think play the old stuff see that's the thing it's like how greedy

505
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,920
are they is what might the real question that we need to be asking them because

506
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,280
they want the PlayStation 2 this still sell well they dropped it down to $99

507
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,520
and they still care about that system because it's still selling pretty well

508
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,240
sometimes outselling the PlayStation 3 but are they going to be greedy enough

509
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,040
to wear that when this does come out this you know if they do happen to

510
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,840
release this you are they going to do it as a you know patch where it will allow

511
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,080
you to play any PlayStation 2 game I think that would be good that would

512
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,960
probably get a lot of their you know people that are pissed off at them off

513
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,200
their backs and look really good in like a PR standpoint but if they are super

514
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,000
greedy they may also say hey we're just gonna limited this to you know the games

515
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,680
that you have to download so you have to rebuy the games you know because people

516
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,960
like buying games from us and we can sell them I think that they should

517
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,960
release it as a patch so that you can play whatever games you have because you

518
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,560
know what people are still gonna buy the games and you especially games that they

519
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,500
can't find anymore can you imagine downloading the original you know

520
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,360
katamari or something like that I mean that'd be fun very interesting comment

521
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,440
in the chat here at chat dot orange hundred dot com from game guru what do

522
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,040
you think of this Loki I think Sony has to kill the PlayStation 2 and get the

523
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,400
PlayStation 2 owners to move on that also makes sense because I think a lot

524
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,600
of people are clinging to the PlayStation 2 and are upgrading well

525
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,880
sure you put a $99 system next to a $399 system and people are you know the

526
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,260
average consumer again that's just looking for something to entertain their

527
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,000
9 and 10 year old is gonna go for the $99 system and also a lot of people are

528
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,960
upgrading because they're a law I have all these PlayStation 2 games you know I

529
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,720
don't want to buy a new system and not be able to play them which I never

530
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,440
understood that argument the first place if you're buying a new system you still

531
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,760
have your old system you can still play your old games it's not like that all

532
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,600
sudden your new old system is just gonna vanish you know it's not gonna you know

533
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,680
incinerate oh speaking as someone who stopped playing PlayStation 2 games on

534
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,720
the PlayStation 3 came out a lot of times it's about space wires and just

535
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,600
the convenience of it convenience is huge and to me owning a Wii and Xbox 360

536
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,160
and a PlayStation 3 there's a lot of fucking cords behind my TV and it's a

537
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,560
bit of a mess with all the different controllers all the different cables all

538
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,960
the different shit I mean and then add into that rock band instruments and so

539
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,520
forth my roommate probably just looks at this and goes my god this is so much

540
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,080
shit you know he's kind of right and to throw into that oh now I'm gonna I want

541
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,600
to whip out the PlayStation 2 and hook that up to and play that you know it's a

542
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,200
lot you know but here we are in the house of dark soccer and Dan they have

543
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,280
all these old systems they do whip them out once in a while and play all the old

544
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,740
stuff but I think it takes a certain type of gamer for that again the average

545
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:05,360
consumer I think gets annoyed with all the stuff to hook up yeah you know

546
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,080
there's people keep this in mind guys you know I realize as gamers who

547
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,360
probably download this podcast interested in the hardcore stuff there's

548
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,560
a lot of people out there who don't even know how to hook this shit up to their

549
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,160
TV they have to call somebody over to explain you maybe you've been called

550
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,880
before think about it haven't you ever been called to install something like

551
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,480
this like a VCR a DVD player a PlayStation onto somebody's TV or had to

552
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,360
fix it because they didn't like a wire came out they didn't know what happened

553
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,040
there's a lot of people that don't understand that stuff and the other

554
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,160
thing too though it's kind of I mean presumptuous of them to assume that

555
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,080
everybody that has a PlayStation 2 is gonna upgrade to a PlayStation 3 I think

556
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,200
a lot of people have gotten tired of their shit and I've already upgraded to

557
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,440
a Wii or well it's not really an upgrade but you know have gotten a Wii or have

558
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,600
upgraded to like a 360 or something like that and you know I was one of those

559
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,960
people I hated the Xbox fucking hated it I was very clear in the show that I

560
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,080
absolutely Sony fanboy 100% me too and then when the Xbox 360 came out it was

561
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,720
like okay well I'll get this in you know a PlayStation 3 later on but you know

562
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,160
then PlayStation 3 came out and I was like I'm not paying $600 for this

563
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,480
luckily you know I I go on for free so I didn't have to do that but you know if I

564
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,680
didn't get for free I would not be buying it so I mean it's just it's

565
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,080
really you know in Microsoft's really changed the way I think about them

566
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,640
because you know with the Xbox is just like oh my god the system's huge it's

567
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,360
like Microsoft learned from their mistakes Microsoft said oh okay you know

568
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,360
we didn't cater enough to the role-playing game fans we didn't care

569
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,320
enough to some of these audiences we were the casual gamer we're gonna try

570
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,240
and fix those things didn't happen overnight but you really see that stuff

571
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,440
starting to come together with a 360 Sony sat on their butt rested on their

572
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,760
laurels a little bit and thought people were gonna pay a premium price because

573
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,560
of blu-ray and all this stuff and they wouldn't really have to work into these

574
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,200
features and now they're kind of having paying for it a little bit trying to

575
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,040
play a little bit of catch-up which you know they're doing to make success

576
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,880
Nintendo fucking smoked weed and made the system that came to them in their

577
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,380
dream I don't know what they did but whatever they did worked like his

578
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,280
Nintendo just woo the Wii was kind of an outer space remember we all first heard

579
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,080
of that we were like fuck is this they redesigned the GameCube and made it you

580
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,360
know with some wireless controllers is basically it you know more or less so I

581
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,600
don't know yeah I'd be interested to see what happens but I have a feeling if

582
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,840
there is going to be any sort of software emulation we're gonna see it

583
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,120
probably by this fall j-rod interesting comments in chat here j-rod says I used

584
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,080
to be all about my 360 but with Microsoft's piss-poor hardware quality

585
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,440
I've moved on to a PlayStation 3 Rama says Microsoft doesn't have piss poor

586
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,800
hardware quality they jumped the gun to beat Sony and I kind of agree with both

587
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,280
of those comments that yeah you definitely noticed that the Microsoft

588
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,240
has the harder higher hardware issue and honestly that system as a piece of

589
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:11,720
hardware loud obnoxious not the most attractive thing in my living room but I

590
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,680
deal with it because of all the things it provides that make sense I you know

591
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,200
it's not actually for me the audio and the sound you know portion of this you

592
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,260
know system as far as how loud is and stuff doesn't really bother me I have a

593
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:31,000
computer that has countless amount of fans on it it's super loud and I really

594
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,440
don't care I just don't even notice it anymore just totally tune it out but yes

595
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,200
the yes the PlayStation 3 is immensely quiet you know compared to the 360

596
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:48,160
definitely all right well let's move on to some more news and I think we'll

597
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,240
continue talking about Sony news I want to talk about this some bundles and I

598
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,720
think this to come up a little earlier a chatter I had mentioned this but I did

599
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,320
just kind of want to reference this it was something we wanted to go over

600
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,440
tonight is that there there does appear to be some new Sony bundles on the way

601
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,440
apparently a Best Buy employee tipped off some of the blogs this week that

602
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,640
there is an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 out there now it has copies of Metal

603
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,680
Gear Solid 4 and Killzone 2 with it all for $400 so that's not too bad

604
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,560
considering you're getting two big games there for $400 also apparently now I

605
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,320
guess rumors are saying is that there's going to be another bundle that could

606
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,240
have LittleBigPlanet I guess with it as well. Yeah they do have it there's one I

607
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,480
think they do have it for LittleBigPlanet and WALL-E. The Blu-ray

608
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,240
interesting that's especially interesting considering WALL-E isn't a

609
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,600
Sony movie it's a Disney movie that's a that's a little weird to me you would

610
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,960
think they would throw in a Sony movie why a kung fu panda or something well

611
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,640
that's not so what I understand the need that you know they're obviously they're

612
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,280
going for the family system but it's very interesting that it's a Disney

613
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,720
movie like that sounds more like something Costco would do you know Costco

614
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,360
bundles all this stuff together they don't need the manufacturer to do it

615
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,440
very interesting but yeah those are some bundles I guess out there in the wild so

616
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,080
they are trying to add more value to the PlayStation 3 so you know it's getting

617
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:17,000
to be a little more reasonable. Definitely something that's not quite

618
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,760
reasonable it's a little weird is GameStop they've had some they have three

619
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,000
bundles that they have available as part of their Wii summer fun bundles and it's

620
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,120
almost like a bad joke they literally have if you buy one of these bottles you

621
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:41,060
can get a Wii bundled with a squirt gun, a Wii bundled with rubber duckies, or a Wii

622
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:49,040
bundled with pirate tattoo arm sleeves. Why? I don't know but these are crappy

623
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,440
little carnival gifts they're just throwing in with the Wii is that is that

624
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,560
really going to motivate someone to go get Nintendo Wii? Oh I want to get the

625
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,800
rubber ducky! It's absolutely crap because if you think about it I mean

626
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:06,600
these are like dollar store toys I mean why would it's like oh you know I got to

627
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:14,600
get a free water gun I mean it's a cheap ass water gun and you know that's the kind of

628
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,280
thing now with like GameStop and you know a lot of these places you know a

629
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,400
lot of people are like my customers I deal with you know bitching about

630
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,360
GameStop having the exclusives for you know different content and stuff

631
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,400
unlockables you know exclusive things like for example in the conduit they had

632
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,180
you know the all-seeing eye was blue in the game that's it it just happened to

633
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:43,160
be blue who cares you know it's like big whoop and this is kind of more like that

634
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,480
it's like okay where the hell did you get these free water pistols for and why

635
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,480
would you you know even think about bundling them with the Wii I mean why

636
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:59,200
even bother it's just crap but I don't know huh I guess they're trying to give

637
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,120
some added value to this but I'm not so sure value at all it's like take a dump

638
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,840
and put it in a bag and throw it in there you worth more than that stuff I

639
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,440
mean seriously it's just what the hell do you thinking the only thing it did

640
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,240
successfully do for them is getting people to talk about on blogs and on

641
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,920
this show because it's you know so asinine but that's not a positive that's

642
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,240
not gonna make anybody go hey I want to go purchase that GameStop because they

643
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,240
get crap with it I again I'm gonna go back to the Costco example Costco will

644
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,920
bundle in useful things with these systems like a free game or something

645
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,720
but now it's free sometimes you're paying a little more money you know the

646
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,920
extra controller but you want to go bundles Costco is a good place to go

647
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,840
there are some games out there they're absolute shit that seriously they could

648
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,120
probably purchase for really really cheap and they could throw that in there

649
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,680
and that would at least be something because it's least a game I can play

650
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,120
with you know the Wii whereas pirate tattoo sleeves I have no idea what the

651
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:04,080
hell I would use that for to be a pirate are alpha-kin anagram and chat says Rob

652
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,120
you would probably be a great voice actor that's like my fucking dream job

653
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,400
don't even joke I would love to do if there's anybody out there possibly at a

654
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,560
game company that is creating a game you need cheap voice acting I will I would

655
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,600
I will willingly be a voice actor in the game that's like my dream to do voice I

656
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,480
don't even care it could be like rubber ducky hunter 2009 I'll still do the

657
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:33,560
voice acting because I think that would be awesome so yeah it sounds like could

658
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:39,720
be an interesting bundle I guess for me for crap lovers a nice try there but I

659
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,800
think you're gonna need to like me I'll do something else too

660
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,600
Oh Shermy wants to get out you might know hey Shermy Oh Shermy the cat has

661
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:55,960
been hiding and I think sure me wants to get out but now sure he's afraid live on

662
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,760
air radio these these things happen we have cat drama going on I think sure

663
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,160
he's afraid now we'll just keep moving just leave the door open for a little

664
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:09,160
bit hopefully it's sure me old sneak out when we're not looking I don't really

665
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,760
have anything else I want to get into right this second well more stories yeah

666
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,080
sure well since we're talking about the we you might not even have to buy a we

667
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,640
because apparently the emulators for the we have been doing a pretty good job

668
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:25,760
themselves in fact the dolphin emulator which salsa does the GameCube games as

669
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,760
well has now gotten you know some games playable and also you know coming out in

670
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,480
720 or 1080p so they're able to render the games a lot higher so that kind of

671
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:44,560
gives you you know 16 16 times anti aliasing and they also had some other

672
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,920
filters that are thrown on top of there but it kind of gives you an impression

673
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,040
of what the we would look like if they came out with a we HD and honestly that

674
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,480
kind of has me kind of excited for like a we HD if they were ever to do that

675
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,840
because some of these games don't look bad actually rendered you know at a

676
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:04,480
higher resolution and granted some textures are kind of I don't know low

677
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,800
whereas but you know like mad world looks sweet super mario galaxy looks

678
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:15,000
pretty awesome they had some other videos I saw of punch-out look pretty

679
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,640
sweet but yeah there's a whole bunch of these and actually the emulator course

680
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,840
is available now and you can check it out wait you can actually doubt that you

681
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,520
could just put the we DVDs in your computer and play these games um I'm not

682
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,760
sure if it reads it actually off the disk I'm not sure if you need like an ISO

683
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,840
or something like that but I do know that it does support the we remote and

684
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,040
none check if you happen to have like a Bluetooth adapter huh and this is just

685
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,600
out there now it's out there now yeah and and the thing is endos not like

686
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,840
worried about this and you also need a pretty I mean you need a decent computer

687
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:55,200
to run it I mean granted your laptop would probably run this pretty well but

688
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,320
like some of the ones that they're showing I think they're like 4 gig

689
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:02,960
processors you know with 4 gigs of RAM you know pretty nice you know new

690
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,080
graphics card and that kind of thing but still though I mean that's you know it

691
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,400
leaves the door open because if you can emulate this stuff on a PC why not you

692
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,000
know what is Shermey doing sure he's finding other places to hide I don't

693
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,480
know just go outside kitty yeah you want to say hi to the listener

694
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:32,840
Shermey no comment comment that's a resounding no nice sorry I didn't mean to

695
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,240
let the kitty bring the show to a screeching halt but yeah this this is

696
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,640
only slightly bothersome I would think for you know Nintendo that that somebody

697
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,280
is actually doing HD was this a YouTube out there so YouTube they've got a whole

698
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,520
bunch of these actually on this is a brawl that they have done on there but I

699
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,000
mean it looks like nice it looks pretty cool yeah it does look pretty nice but

700
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,680
yeah it's do some searches online for we emailers there's actually a guy who does

701
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,040
our reviews of the emulators and the games and how they play in there and

702
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:12,560
stuff like that I want to say let's see here I think it's um Raini Bara Hona is

703
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:21,120
the user on YouTube re ne ba ra ho na and he has a bunch of different videos

704
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,080
actually watched the Metroid Prime 3 corruption one earlier but he has

705
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,520
reviews I think I think he's the one that's doing the reviews on him let me

706
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,640
get some comments from chat real quick because game guru wants to clarify PCs

707
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,920
can't read Nintendo optical discs so I was a little crazy there with that

708
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,120
comment but also tells me that Nintendo could get 720p with a firmware update to

709
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,920
use those four unused connections I don't know I mean keep in mind these

710
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,160
emulators are running off computer hardware and a Wii is running off the

711
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,320
hardware of two game cubes maybe it can't just simply run this with a

712
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,000
firmware update or I would have hoped they would have done it a long time ago

713
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,720
I don't know yeah I don't know either do you think Nintendo should be worried

714
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,320
about something like this I mean the fact that their system is being

715
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,520
emulated while it is still out there and some might say better than the actual

716
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,880
system itself they should be worried if it's actually because there are some

717
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,640
minor texture problems and stuff like that like there'll be some textures that

718
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,520
are supposed to be more transparent that aren't appearing transparent or like a

719
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,720
few little issues but they're definitely playable so they should be worried if

720
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:30,040
it's able to you know do that stuff and you don't necessarily need a you know we

721
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,880
remote and nunchuck to play this you can actually lose with keyboard and mouse

722
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,720
you know using the mouse as the Wii pointer or whatever and you know the

723
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,360
keyboard as your joysticks or whatever so yeah I guess you know I would

724
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,160
actually like to play a lot more of these things on here and you check them

725
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,840
out see what the games look like because you know mad world look really sweet it

726
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,280
kind of makes me wish they'd poured into the 360 or something and all they're

727
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,160
doing is they're just smoothing the textures basically they're in the 16

728
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,520
16 times it's not like it was going back to reprogram these things or anything or

729
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,640
any more work went into them or anything like that no not really and because the

730
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:12,200
reason this was actually I mean this is the dolphin emulator was for the Game

731
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,280
Cube and they just modified it to work with the Wii when the Wii came out

732
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,600
because it's basically GameCube hardware and you know almost the same type of

733
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:27,000
instruction set so I don't know I mean it's just you know goes to show you that

734
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,440
the Wii is really you know very similar to a GameCube and kind of wish that they

735
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,680
would do like a Wii HD because at the same time here's what they could do with

736
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,760
their games they could upscale all the games that you have come out and they

737
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,520
could you do some new or higher def games or something like that or you can

738
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,040
spend the money and just get a new an upscaler for your you know home

739
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:53,840
entertainment system and you can just do the same thing with Wii so well

740
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,600
apparently there is a new Final Fantasy game on the way and it looks like this

741
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,680
game is being made for the DS it was actually teased around there on the

742
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,880
internet and then Famitsu I don't think actually no I'm sorry it came from jump

743
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,920
magazine I believe is the the magazine that finally spilled the details on this

744
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,760
it's Final Fantasy Gaiden it's a new kind of Final Fantasy RPG for the DS it

745
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,680
looks a lot like the Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4 remakes that have

746
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,520
happened recently but it's kind of a new story apparently it's about a boy who

747
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,960
must rescue a princess from a witch your very typical kind of Final Fantasy

748
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,040
sounding storyline their typical fantasy story although I'm sure the end of the

749
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,600
world will somehow be worked into it as well the battle system is of course the

750
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,480
one you all know and love the turn-based menu system there's apparently though

751
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,600
now action points when you see your status you also have yellow dots that go

752
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,120
with that and the actions that you want to do also have dots next to it that

753
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,600
indicate how much it's going to cost so think of it sounds to me like it's not

754
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,200
magic points but like fighting points a little different they're gonna be coming

755
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,000
out in the u.s. actually I'm sorry it's gonna come out in the fall in Japan that

756
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,200
would mean probably next year in the u.s. once they get it all translated it

757
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:11,240
sounds right yeah there you go lots of fun Final Fantasy stuff I was bringing

758
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,600
up here real quick I want to show you mad world running on the emulator and

759
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,960
this actually should post this link in chat a chat that I was ready to call

760
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,320
just of how sharp the game looks I mean cuz mad world it's all black and white

761
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,240
and the line art and stuff like that you can see how it looks a little foggy

762
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,800
right there that's you know the one of the problems with the emulator at least

763
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,680
in this game but I mean look at how sharp everything looks it's just awesome

764
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,400
very that is pretty neat you should share that in chat if definitely you

765
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,560
haven't already chat dot orange launch rated calm that does look pretty nice

766
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:53,320
yeah um let's see some other stuff we can talk about here we'll probably do

767
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,040
one more story and then we'll get into the classic game of the week and part B

768
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,560
of our show coming up a little later as well as your phone calls one eight seven

769
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,240
seven game olr will open up the phones a little later on in the program well

770
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,080
Nintendo might not be too worried about some games at least you know in this

771
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:13,520
emulator Wii Sports Resort in Japan just came out what last week and already

772
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:21,400
they've sold over 350,000 copies I'm actually selling it's the third fastest

773
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,920
selling we title ever and it's moved three hundred fifty three thousand eight

774
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:32,440
hundred and twenty seven copies as of June 30th so by now who knows but it's

775
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,360
gonna be selling I think pretty well and who knows when it hits the US I know

776
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,680
this thing's been selling like hotcakes already so I actually don't think you'll

777
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,400
see the impressive day one numbers that you're seeing over in Japan I don't

778
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,080
think the US audience especially those that are huge in the week are that as

779
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:53,280
tuned in to you know when games are coming out and you know we were much

780
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,160
more tuned in in our culture to win movies are coming out like you probably

781
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,720
know what movies are opening up this week and actually I don't think most

782
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,120
casual gamers and non hardcore gamers are as tuned in with the release dates

783
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,600
so I don't think you'll see this have the same type of day one sales here but

784
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,120
I think you'll see it grow quickly yeah definitely and I think a lot of you know

785
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,280
casual gamers obviously probably be picking this up for like Christmas or

786
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,360
you know the holidays there's a long period of time you know period of time

787
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,240
and I mean look at like Mario Kart Wii it still sells really well only you

788
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,600
know mark no Mario Party 8 that stuff sells really well it's just a lot of

789
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:35,000
these games are just evergreen will sell for the life of the system so I could

790
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,240
definitely see this lasting a long time and it probably will end up selling

791
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,840
quite a bit and it could also be like we play whereas people bought this you know

792
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,400
they could be buying this for we motion plus you know save some money that way

793
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,600
and they get a game with it so I could definitely see something like that

794
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,480
happening yeah I just don't think you know I think when it comes out here

795
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,080
you're gonna see I bet you that first week oh I didn't sell nearly as well in

796
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:04,240
the u.s. is it in Japan oh my gosh it's it's a failure for Nintendo mmm give it

797
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:09,040
a couple months give it a couple months for the hardcore gamers who still love

798
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,760
a Nintendo to pick it up and then their friends to see it and then their friends

799
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,960
to see it and then CNN to do a news story on it and then Oprah to have it on

800
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,560
her show give it some time wrong wrong it will not be Oprah having in our show

801
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,800
it'll be Ellen DeGeneres because she likes hey Ellen Ellen has a very high

802
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,920
rated show don't don't hate don't hate on Ellen I'm just saying Oprah's not

803
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:36,000
she's more tech retarded as I'd like to put I don't know if I should admit that

804
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,480
I was watching Oprah but I was I was changing the channels and landed on

805
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,040
Oprah one day this is a couple months ago she had Facebook on her show they

806
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,880
were talking they were doing I know Oprah I guess has this thing where she

807
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,600
rips off the view now where she actually has a panelist of people on some some

808
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,920
days of the week I don't know but she had the dude from Facebook they're

809
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,640
talking about the business and I guess that was the same day that Oprah was

810
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,640
launching her own Facebook account or official Facebook or something it was

811
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,240
just like Twitter when she had Twitter on her show that site blew up remember

812
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,520
that yeah when they announced the official Oprah Twitter don't

813
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:15,000
underestimate the power of Oprah some might say that was the day the Twitter

814
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,880
jumped the shark to j-rod says people scream failure if it doesn't sell a

815
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,320
million in its first week remember how little big planet was a failure yeah I

816
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,120
mean I would actually agree with you the little big planet not only is it one of

817
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,800
the best games on PlayStation 3 right now period if not the best in some

818
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,560
circles but I think that's still a game that sells fairly well I don't know

819
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,840
PlayStation 3 figures that well but I have to be a consistent seller too I

820
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,400
don't think it's really like tapered off horrifically or anything I think you

821
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,440
know I don't think you can really compare Sony sales figures to Nintendo

822
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,800
sales figures I think horribly underrated underappreciated and it's

823
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,440
gonna be one of those games like katamari was where is horribly

824
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,720
underrated underappreciated and you know granted we all as game fans might

825
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:06,640
appreciate it and understand how awesome it is but the casual gamer they don't

826
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,080
understand it and you know it's sad because I think if you put it in the

827
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,320
hands of like someone that is more of a casual gamer and they actually played it

828
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,640
they would probably think it's really cool but then again there's some people

829
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,400
there's like oh my god controllers oh I can't I can't I can't do that although

830
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,400
really the only you know stuff in little big planet is run jump and occasionally

831
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,680
grab yeah but you have to understand these are the same people that can't

832
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,120
hook up their damn game systems it's all color-coded true true yellow the yellow

833
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:40,760
I mean it's matching matching colors can you not understand that I guess not some

834
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,280
people can't some people can't all right should we get into the classic game of

835
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,120
the week I think we shall did you want to say one more one more thing real

836
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,400
quick is really quick go electroplankton is coming to DSI where in Japan only and

837
01:00:53,400 --> 01:01:00,440
of course it will be sold for oh that's a ripoff anyways it's picking their

838
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,240
their breaking up electroplankton because it was 10 different little

839
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,720
programs that you can make music with they're breaking them all up individually

840
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:15,680
the 200 Nintendo points each so $20 total seemed kind of a ripoff if you

841
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,180
ask me but I think that's what the game originally sold for I was to say you had

842
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:22,740
to originally buy like it was weird they didn't even market this game big time

843
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:26,040
you had to buy it through Nintendo site you can even get in stores remember yeah

844
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:31,980
and having played electroplankton I don't get what the point is I mean it

845
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:37,120
was it was neat for a second and then I put it down and never touches again so I

846
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:42,180
can't recommend buying this but hey if you're in Japan and you want to waste

847
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:47,640
you know some points there you go all right we are gonna get into the classic

848
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,760
game of the week we like to take a few moments here at the end of part a every

849
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,680
week to reflect on gaming's history and some of the games that helped bring the

850
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,640
games we have today out there usually dark Sakura goes through her archives

851
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,100
and picks a classic game of the week but since she's not here tonight the one and

852
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:06,800
only Loki it's his turn to replace her with his entry into the classic game of

853
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:12,480
the week and I believe he has picked a doozy this week so Loki what is the

854
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,160
classic game of the week this week classic game of the week has been a

855
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:20,100
game that I've wasted countless hours on one of my favorite games has been on

856
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:26,040
every Nintendo system it would be Mario Kart not a Super Mario Kart Super Mario

857
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:32,040
Kart yes careful well I like Mario Kart in general but Mario Kart one started

858
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:39,720
all on the Super Nintendo came out in 1992 wow that was a long time ago and

859
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:50,040
did quite well sold you know I think eight million copies worldwide and was

860
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:56,840
the I think number two title for the super NES really yeah wow that must be

861
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:03,720
only behind what Mario World even though that was the pack-in game I think so Wow

862
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,920
Mario World actually was it I take it back it was not number two is number

863
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:18,320
three but hey it's close enough I mean don't keep on country also I want to

864
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,320
point out Game Guru and chat says Mario Kart wasn't on the NES or Game Boy true

865
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,360
but they still called it Super Mario Kart the name of this game is Super Mario

866
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:32,200
Mario Kart yes Super Mario Kart was one of those mode seven games you race

867
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:36,840
around on kind of a flat track but of course you have little blocks and stuff

868
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,240
that made the course and everything they had a bunch of different theme levels

869
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:46,760
including you know the booze mansion and well they weren't really a mansion it

870
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,560
was kind of like Doc's almost like dark place but a Bowser's castle of course

871
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,720
they had the mushroom cup shell cup flower cup banana cup and you had

872
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:01,840
unlocked you know each of the I think it'd be golden those in order to unlock

873
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,080
the rest of the cup and of course who would forget you know who could forget

874
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:10,680
the special cup that they had there with Rainbow Road which is awesome Rainbow

875
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:19,200
Road was sweet and but the thing that I spent the most time on and oh so many

876
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:25,520
hours lost to this versus mode versus in battle mode you know we played battle

877
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,320
mode forever and battle mode of course you the object of the game was to pop

878
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:36,000
the other carts three balloons and you know we've wasted so much time doing

879
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,920
that but you'd have different shells of course the green shell was kind of

880
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,120
dumbfire shell that you'd shoot straight ahead you've got red shell which you

881
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:49,200
know is kind of a homing missile almost your bananas they drop behind you to you

882
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:55,520
know get out the other player also you know your mushrooms for boosts and in

883
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,200
the original game actually they had the feather that you get they could jump and

884
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,840
that was handy for jumping walls or jumping the shortcuts and stuff like

885
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:08,920
that of course later on they had more sequels for the game on practically

886
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,600
every Nintendo system is actually on every Nintendo system and they even made

887
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:21,640
its debut in the arcade with two arcade games Mario Kart arcade GP and GP to

888
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:26,600
the first one of course I am famous for playing drunk during my bachelor party

889
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:31,200
and which by far orange launch radios most viewed YouTube clip and I don't

890
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:36,360
remember much of it but I'm actually did play it later on it was all right and

891
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:42,160
it's not the same it doesn't have the same charm no it doesn't but uh you know

892
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,880
of course the original Super Mario Kart game had quite a few characters in there

893
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,480
you know they had some unlockable characters as well but the starting

894
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:57,680
lineup of course yet Bowser Luigi Mario peach Toad and Yoshi and you can also

895
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:05,400
unlock don't come junior and Koopa Koopa and of course the little trick is you

896
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:19,200
can shrink those down as well and yeah pretty much it and it also actually made

897
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,520
its way to the Guinness Book World Records gamers edition 2008 which goes

898
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,900
to show you that they will put pretty much anything in this book but it was

899
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:32,960
awarded the first console kart racing game and best-selling a handheld racing

900
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:37,920
game course cuz you know was it really that yes it was really the first kart

901
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,960
racing game interesting I wonder what they got the idea for this

902
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:47,320
they actually fact-checked that stuff that seems awfully weird I don't doubt

903
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,080
that it's true I mean I can't think of another one that there was but it's just

904
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,280
kind of interesting

905
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,280
yeah

906
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:01,920
but uh yeah I mean lots of fun and you know of course my car we came out last

907
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,400
year still pretty fun but you know it just doesn't have a charm I think of an

908
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,840
original Mario Kart game which is available for virtual console download I

909
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:17,600
believe remember correctly is this a good one it is I know Mario Kart 64 is I

910
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,720
don't know about the classic though really I don't think the classic one is

911
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,840
still up surprise surprise to it maybe it is and I just missed it amongst all

912
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,440
the other crap that they put out honestly I haven't downloaded anything

913
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:34,240
in person for a long time so it's been mainly we were this was my college dorm

914
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,320
years by the way do you know what the epic battles we had on this game in my

915
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,440
college dorm and this is probably about 96 or 97 or so I remember when the

916
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,320
people upstairs got a Nintendo 64 and got Mario Kart 64 oh my god that was

917
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:55,800
before I was not as big of a fan of 64 as I was this one but it was you know

918
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,160
still really fun to play and I think I just this one is kind of one of those

919
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:03,600
like you know sentimental type games for the love of God Nintendo when you put

920
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,680
out a new Mario Kart game and I know how you like doing classic tracks and stuff

921
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:13,320
is it gonna really kill you to not you know include all of the old battle

922
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,320
courses or something like that they always seem to find the ones that like

923
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:20,800
nobody played and let's just like bring that one back it's it's like come on

924
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,840
well dude in that new one they had battle course 4 and that was the one we

925
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,600
always played on the old school one was the you know with the squares square

926
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,160
square kind of looking thing yeah we used to play that one all the time so

927
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,040
it just wasn't the same though no I wasn't without the feather because you

928
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,000
get the feather you can jump or the wall oh that's true I didn't think about the

929
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,400
feather huh interesting all right well that's gonna do it for your classic game

930
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,320
of the week Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo good pick yeah apparently

931
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:51,040
a Super Mario Kart is not available on virtual console only Mario Kart 64 damn

932
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:55,920

940
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:34,560
come join us in chat chat.orangeloungeradio.com I don't know why we use a

941
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,320
separate chat from all games radio but we do we just always have because

942
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:41,200
remember Orange Lounge Radio was its own station now is at this point many years

943
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,240
ago I don't even remember when we pulled the plug on live 365 but it was a while

944
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:48,000
ago now it's about a year and a half ago so we've been at all games radio ever

945
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,800
since our our new home where we were syndicated for a while and now we're

946
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,280
somewhat of an all-games exclusive but of course you can always get the podcast

947
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,960
when I'm able to get it up to date and I apologize again that I'm not always

948
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,760
current but I try to be please no it's not a anti podcast thing I promise

949
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,080
anyway part B here we go we're gonna get to your mailbag and the FUs of the week

950
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,880
and the release dates we got all sorts of stuff we should go still get a cover

951
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,240
I'm sure though Loki has a little few more news stories for us I have tons of

952
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:21,160
news stories and let's talk about a music game because that's what's awesome

953
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:26,240
DJ Hero announced of course that they're gonna be I should say Activision

954
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:31,600
announced the DJ Hero would contain Grandmaster Flash and not only will he

955
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,200
be appearing in the game as himself and you know among the cast of other DJs

956
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:41,720
that are in the game but he'll also be contributing to songs including one

957
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:48,920
remix as Herbie Hancock rocket versus nerds lap dance and then also Grand

958
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:55,840
Master Flash here comes my DJ and versus Gary Newman cars I'm all about DJ Hero I

959
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,080
think this game looks awesome yes yes it looks really sweet I'm not surprised

960
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,840
though that they're including the old you know some of the old the some of the

961
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,960
deep famous DJ is kind of like they do in guitar here all right you have like

962
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:11,480
slash shows up and you know buckethead and some of these people so it's pretty

963
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:17,720
cool yeah so I'm very cool and you know just excited that we're gonna we're

964
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:23,480
hearing more songs coming out of it um what else was I wanted to say about DJ

965
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,960
Hero it's still gonna be extensive though of course is the only kind of

966
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,680
outside but what do you do but the thing is though is it's the only game I'm

967
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:35,360
buying this fall really out of all the stuff coming out this fall silly game

968
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,720
I'm buying this fall because you can't pirate the the turntable I see how you

969
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:46,200
know it really deserves my money but um yeah it's just you know with kids coming

970
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:51,320
you know really honestly I mean piracy aside you know I'm probably not gonna

971
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,160
be playing a lot of games in the fall we'll be playing the grant of thought oh

972
01:11:55,160 --> 01:12:00,320
expansion a new one but that's for sure but really with kids coming is just like

973
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:06,360
I'll be lucky to play DJ Hero I hope we get DJ Samantha Ronson in the game though

974
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,480
so we can have her girlfriend Lindsay Lohan or on again off again girlfriend

975
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:16,920
make a cameo pretty awesome I think so yeah but is she any good has she

976
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:21,640
actually made music I think she's a somewhat respected DJ I think it's more

977
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,120
than just who her girlfriend is Sacramento not that long ago they were

978
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:31,240
promoting it on the radio I don't know I had there's a lot joking I don't think

979
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:35,520
she's a long list of other DJs I'd rather see in the game than her fine fine

980
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,360
I try to make a silly little joke I know that's what I do like have we heard a

981
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,640
lot about download content with DJ hero there will be some that's about all we

982
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:49,080
know because I know someone actually I for whatever reason they have visited

983
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,200
their website and actually looked at their Twitter and there was someone

984
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,920
asking hey is there gonna be download content and they're like of course

985
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,400
there's gonna be download content but not necessarily regularly like you see

986
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,200
in rock band because guitar heroes download content seems to be a bit more

987
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:08,800
sporadic yeah I'd be guessing that's gonna be a bit more sporadic Marissa

988
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,400
congusto in our chat room chat that orange laundry calm says it could be a

989
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:16,440
pixelated low hand tweeting naked pics that would be a true to life wouldn't it

990
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:23,400
a little to do life all right what else you have for us lovey also of course not

991
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,200
really something I would utilize and not really something you'd utilize anymore

992
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:35,680
but Twitter has come to Warcraft thanks to tweet craft a in-game client that you

993
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:44,480
can get you can now Twitter inside the confines of Warcraft this would actually

994
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:49,600
be cool believe it or not if I was like a role player I think it would be kind

995
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,280
of neat to have a character using a Twitter like create a character and have

996
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:58,000
them tweet about the things they're doing in World of Warcraft and I think

997
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,400
that's probably what most people use it for but I just hope it doesn't turn into

998
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:06,880
this whole like oh I just turned in this quest oh I just dinged to level 77 oh

999
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,200
we're running this instance anyone want to join because we don't really need to

1000
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,300
fill Twitter up with that garbage I hope none of my personal friends are you

1001
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:17,600
gonna use this for that but if they're using it to keep all the crack in their

1002
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,800
vein like they play World of War crack and have Twitter at the same time like

1003
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,480
I can also understand the need to have that crack all at once all they need now

1004
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,880
is Facebook as well in World of Warcraft if they don't already have it and then

1005
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,560
everybody's crack should be set I know according to the screen shot here it

1006
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,880
doesn't look like they're using it for roleplay in fact one of the people says

1007
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,920
thank God CNN's finally segueing from reporting on Michael Jackson's still

1008
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:47,820
being dead to reporting on what happened to bubbles the chimp nice formation we

1009
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:51,440
need to know right away I'm reading this stuff in chat which is great

1010
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:55,760
tiger class says great now you can tweet when you're in a wow raid SSJ 100 Matt

1011
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,840
says at Rob I just got a four strength force damn leather belt that's a all

1012
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:10,400
games inside joke I'll have you know frisbee says mom bathroom nice let's

1013
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,880
just encourage people to not have any human interaction whatsoever by putting

1014
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,760
Twitter in World of Warcraft exactly I'm not gonna say I'm glad I left because

1015
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:24,280
I'm not vindictive about the reasons I left but I am I'm I'm comfortable with

1016
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,000
my decision and you know that there's many other games to be playing right now

1017
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,840
and something although sorry I will say this I am kind of sad that I feel like

1018
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,920
some people I don't talk to anymore because I don't play World of Warcraft

1019
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,160
which is kind of sad I'm like just call me dude let's hang out let's do some

1020
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,560
besides rating hang out in World of Warcraft

1021
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:50,760
I know no it's something you may need if you really you're you know living the

1022
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:55,920
sedentary lifestyle hopefully I will never need this but there is a new DS

1023
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,680
plug-in that you can use with your DS and DS I because it actually plugs into

1024
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:06,960
the DS slot and not the you know the gameboy advanced lot but it is a a

1025
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:13,800
device called digit and it's for helping diabetic kids record their sugar levels

1026
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:20,160
so that they can see if they're okay you know it helps them test their sugar and

1027
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:26,200
I don't know so really you can turn your DS into a diabetic monitor now yeah it's

1028
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:32,480
a you know sugar glucose reader and it's I'm not sure if you can use this like

1029
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:36,040
well I'll tell you right now your insurance ain't gonna cover it so what

1030
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:40,640
you're gonna be paying for that out-of-pocket but I guess what it is

1031
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,640
probably it's like a diabetic monitor you know when you're diabetic you have

1032
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,440
to track you know this I'm you have to track your glucose several times a day

1033
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,800
it depends on how you know there's different stages of diabetes is a very

1034
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,200
common disease like Halle Berry has diabetes a lot of very famous people

1035
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,800
have diabetes you have to track your your sugar levels several points

1036
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,640
throughout the day and then it's you might be what they call insulin

1037
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,000
dependent or if your levels are really out of whack you have to inject yourself

1038
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,280
with insulin this monitor if they're encouraging kids to use this monitor

1039
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,720
there with their DS is probably a way to kind of track those levels but more so

1040
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,120
for their parents to look at it I bet is it's actually kind of a neat use of

1041
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:21,160
technology I actually think it's kind of a neat use of the DS this is this is a

1042
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:26,680
feel-good CNN good news story of the week type thing and intended in think of

1043
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:32,160
it first screw you vitality monitor alpha

1044
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,680
kenanagram in chat says Loki yeah this looks like bears ray rebranding of the

1045
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,320
glucose boy independent they look the same so I'm guessing bear about the tech

1046
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:43,700
from the guy that made glucose boy probably possibly who knows frisbee

1047
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:51,640
Aston chat where can I when can I have the Wii Fit glaucoma meter so I do think

1048
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:55,400
it's a pretty pretty neat idea hey look you brought up World of Warcraft earlier

1049
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,200
and I want to talk about this a little bit because I thought this story was

1050
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:02,720
very interesting having been in a game that was ruined by gold farming or in

1051
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,880
that particular game Gill farming the game was completely ruined by that

1052
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,080
although they have made a motion to fix it I'll give credit where credit is due

1053
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:16,520
but it came way too late anyhow there was just stories going crazy around the

1054
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:21,880
net this week that China had actually banned gold farming which is a huge

1055
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:27,240
industry in China it's what like 500 million dollar industry in China that it

1056
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,920
was banned this week which is huge news well I don't know if you're aware but

1057
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:36,000
not really that's not really what happened here's what China really banned

1058
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,440
was using virtual money for gambling and will be you know punished by you know

1059
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,440
public security authorities and miners cannot use cannot buy virtual money

1060
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,760
here's what it really comes down to is I think it's well a it's miners too it's

1061
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:54,120
not you know adults but also the fact that the real problem and and Richard

1062
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:57,280
Heeks who is a professor at the University of Manchester kind of breaks

1063
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:02,920
it down it's what it really is is using these fake currencies one of the big

1064
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:08,880
ones is called QQ coins used to buy real I know it's funny huh used to of QQ I

1065
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,160
don't have any real money using these QQ coins to pay for virtual game stuff

1066
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:18,960
apparently some folks were using them to pay for real things and that's what the

1067
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,760
law is to prevent using virtual currency to buy real products that's what it

1068
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,400
comes down to and most people are when you do gold farming that's the other way

1069
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,840
around you're paying real money for virtual items that's still okay it's the

1070
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:36,440
other way around that is now illegal which isn't going to impact any of the

1071
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:41,400
gold farming industry I'm sorry to say and that makes everyone go QQ exactly

1072
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:47,680
because the QQ dollars are still out there that's all I got that's funny do

1073
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:54,600
you think they should ban the real thing I don't know if they can that's where I'm

1074
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:59,200
at I'm like you know what why bother at this point it's out there it's up to the

1075
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:03,920
game makers I think to some extent to stop this shit if they want to really they

1076
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:09,280
if they really wanted to stop this crap they could but most don't and really you

1077
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:14,800
know as much as I see you know you know it it's not a good thing to buy money

1078
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,400
they're kind of doing the work and earning the money they're not really

1079
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,380
exploiting unless they're exploiting the game is cheap and get the money you know

1080
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,440
if they're earning the money in the game and there's someone out there it's

1081
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,900
desperate enough to pay for that money. I don't see the problem in that. I see the

1082
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,760
problem in if they're cheating to get the money and then it screws up the whole

1083
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:37,500
economy. Plus, it also depends on the game's design. Like, I don't think gold

1084
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,320
farming is that big of an epidemic in World of Warcraft. I know it's out there,

1085
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,120
I know it's being done, but in World of Warcraft it's not that hard to make

1086
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:48,080
money. They have dailies, they have ways to make money. Gold farming is for lazy

1087
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,360
people. If people are too lazy to make gold the hard way. Now here's the thing,

1088
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,280
in Final Fantasy XI, you couldn't make gil that easily. You could not make gil

1089
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,960
as easily as you can make money. And some would argue with me, you know, and

1090
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,980
that's just ridiculous. And again, I realize the game has changed an

1091
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:07,400
awful lot since I left. You know, now they have more things that are solo. I'm

1092
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,400
talking about the old Final Fantasy XI. Things that I hope Square has learned

1093
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,480
before Final Fantasy XIV, in other words, is that, you know, gil farming was an

1094
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,280
epidemic and it was killing the game. Because what would happen is, yeah, what

1095
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:23,040
was the only way to make gil? You camp these notorious monsters that would drop

1096
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,240
items that would be worth millions of gil. Well guess what? All the gold farmers

1097
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:29,440
are out there camping with you and they got good at it. But WoW doesn't have

1098
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:34,240
that as an epidemic. So, you know, finally, years later, they changed it in Final

1099
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:37,160
Fantasy where the items would bind a certain way. You know, it just took them

1100
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,560
too damn long to do it. Lessons, again, I hope they have learned moving into Final

1101
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,760
Fantasy XIV. Because Final Fantasy XIV has the potential to be amazing.

1102
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,720
Rama asked in our chat room, chat.orangemanstrategy.com, now with Final

1103
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,880
Fantasy XIV will they shut down Final Fantasy XI? Hardly. No. Will they have

1104
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:57,120
to do server consolidations and things of this sort? Probably. Will they lose

1105
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:01,520
players? Probably. But they'll probably charge more for Final Fantasy XIV. Not a

1106
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,920
lot more, but they'll probably charge like 1495 or 1595 a month. Because they

1107
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,400
could probably get away with it. So they won't care if people jump ship because

1108
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,840
they'll end up making more money off of them. I guess XI. It's actually... I had a lot of fun with it.

1109
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,320
I did too, you know, but I'll tell you what, Loki, I went back, tried to play

1110
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,840
again. It's just, you know, maybe if all the people were still there, which I don't

1111
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:24,440
think is gonna happen, it would be kind of cooler. But the way it is right now,

1112
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:29,720
I just... I don't have the time for an MMO anyway, so... But I'm looking forward to

1113
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,480
Final Fantasy XIV. I am definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV. I'm all

1114
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:36,560
over that shit. I'm not looking forward to it because I won't be able to play it,

1115
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,600
probably. Poor thing. What you can do, come over to my house. You can play.

1116
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,880
Just, you know, tell the wife you're coming over to hang out with Rob. We're gonna

1117
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:55,240
watch movies. Bring the kids! Get them into it. No, no, no, that, you know, I... Nellie

1118
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:59,840
doesn't want the kids playing video games. I mean, basically she doesn't want them

1119
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,400
ignoring homework to play the video games. Just fine. I understand that,

1120
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:07,320
because, you know what, I never did that. I always did my homework, and then, well, I

1121
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,000
most of the time did my homework, and I didn't really, you know, play video games.

1122
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,480
It wasn't an issue like that, but they're gonna play video games. They're, yeah,

1123
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,000
they're gonna play video games more than the other. I think what your wife

1124
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,280
hopefully already knows is that if you try to stop them from doing it, they're

1125
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:26,040
just going to want to do it more. So you just have to find a balance, is that you

1126
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:31,760
can play one out. You can use the TV for two hours. You want to watch cartoons. You

1127
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,300
want to play video games. Whatever the F you want to do on the TV. I wouldn't say

1128
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:38,640
that, obviously, but whatever the F, and me explaining it to you, whatever the F

1129
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,960
you want to do for the TV with two hours, that's yours. But either A, once your

1130
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,280
homework gets done first, or B, once your two hours is up, you better be doing your

1131
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:50,120
homework, or you're gonna lose your TV time, you know, something like that.

1132
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,120
That's the kind of system I think you have to do. Always homework first.

1133
01:23:53,120 --> 01:24:01,560
Yes. Okay, let's talk a little bit about, wait, can I say, can I say, because this is

1134
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,600
obviously a sparked discussion in our chat room. I have to read this at

1135
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,800
chat.orangelandtrader.com. First off, about Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV,

1136
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,440
SGA 100 Matt says they said they will continue to release expansion for Final Fantasy XI,

1137
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,480
and especially now that they're doing the download expansions now, like there's

1138
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:21,360
the MOG, the coup d'etat, or whatever they call it. What the hell is it called,

1139
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:26,280
the new Mughal one? The coup d'etat is coming out today, I think, is

1140
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,960
when it came out. They're doing the download ones now. They'll continue to do

1141
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,120
that. Just like EverQuest and EverQuest 2 is that I think, unlike EverQuest and EverQuest 2,

1142
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:37,120
I think you will see a lot more players on Final Fantasy XIV than XI. I think a lot of

1143
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,680
people who left XI are gonna come back for XIV. I think that will happen.

1144
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:47,760
Also, some comments on the babies. Tigerclaw says they're gonna play video games while

1145
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,000
parents are asleep. That's true. If the TV is in the kids room with the console,

1146
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,440
they're gonna play the video games while you sleep. TV is not gonna be in the kids room.

1147
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,640
GS68 says, from kindergarten through third grade, my parents would only let me play video games on

1148
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:04,760
weekends. And I'm thinking, you know, the kids can play not the new console games.

1149
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:09,040
They gotta play the old stuff, because it also is more family-friendly, you know, whereas the new stuff,

1150
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:14,240
you know, no playing Grand Theft Auto. Although, although with Grand Theft Auto, you know, I know

1151
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,960
enough about hacking that I could probably take out the blood and stuff.

1152
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:22,440
Marisa Congusto in chat says, my dad had a really good parenting strategy so I

1153
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:27,560
couldn't play too many video games. He played them so I couldn't. That's more

1154
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:32,600
like it. You should suggest that to the wife. I'm only playing video games

1155
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:41,600
so the kids can do their homework. I'm doing you a favor. Now cook dinner.

1156
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,040
Then she needs to learn how to play video games, I don't know. Alright. Yeah, you're gonna learn how to play video games or cook dinner.

1157
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:52,440
You need to play one or the other. She's gonna cook dinner because she hates video games.

1158
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:56,360
Or she'll play Animal Crossing for the rest of her life. To talk a little bit more about Sony

1159
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:00,600
PlayStation. You may remember, of course, they have their PlayStation Eye-based

1160
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:05,120
motion capture system that they're planning on using for some really

1161
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:11,880
retarded looking ice cream cone things. But there's apparently another tech thing

1162
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:17,200
that they, I guess, registered a patent for that's gonna utilize what looks like

1163
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:24,280
a giant square-shaped U-thing. Almost like the U-Force. You know, kind of scary

1164
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:29,720
enough, but apparently you would use this device in your hands, I guess, in

1165
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:36,280
replace, you know, to replace the cosmic ice cream cone thing. But you would use it,

1166
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:42,240
I guess, like a, you know, baseball bat or golf club or, you know, sword, whatever.

1167
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:47,840
That thing's gonna get broken. That thing looks retarded, if you ask me. Well, maybe

1168
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,320
it was just patented. That doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna use it. I

1169
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:56,560
don't know. Just a giant U of death. applicant anagram is saying that's just

1170
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,880
a random object, not a controller. That the U is supposed to represent some type

1171
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,040
of object the person has in their home. And that's what I had thought I'd read

1172
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,760
is something about that you can use this thing is supposed to be, like, so any

1173
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,800
object can be used in the game. Which is kind of similar. Isn't that similar to what

1174
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,080
Natal was saying, too? Yeah. It's gonna be able to scan, like, the kid's skateboard

1175
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,800
in a little preview. Okay, well that, yeah. So something similar here, right? That'll work as

1176
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:23,680
well as they show, but yeah. That's neat. I don't like the idea of those swinging

1177
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:28,120
around something that even resembles a baseball bat in my house, so. Unless it's

1178
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:32,240
a Nerf bat. Even then. Couldn't you just roll up a piece of paper and tell the

1179
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:37,920
game it's a bat? It would work, right? Roll up the newspaper, thunk. Couldn't I

1180
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:42,880
hold up the cat and say it's a baseball bat? How long is it gonna take before

1181
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,560
someone tries to use their penis on this? It's gonna happen. That's the age-old

1182
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:53,000
question about new peripherals. How long before a penis is used with it? How long?

1183
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,920
Try 30 seconds. That's the length of time to unzip and unzip the pants and undo the

1184
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:07,460
bell buckle. Scan this! Oh my god. Alright. Hey, look. We got some emails we got to

1185
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:10,840
read, so let's get to the mailbag. How's that sound? Mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com

1186
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,800
That's where you send your emails every week and we read some of our favorites

1187
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,840
here on the show. That's exactly what I'm gonna do right now. If the Star Stalker's not here

1188
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:23,540
tonight, I will read them. If you can scan its objects to be used as guns, you can

1189
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:28,600
have your own laser tag. Yes, whatever happened to laser cat the video game? You

1190
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:32,400
think with community games we would have this now? I'm surprised we don't.

1191
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:36,400
Somebody needs to get on that. Sorry, I had the music blaring that whole time.

1192
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,200
Mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com if you want to send us an email. Email. First email

1193
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:45,680
to us tonight comes from Rick and Rick sent us an email and the subject is

1194
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:49,920
Nintendo divorce notice. I would like to hereby make public my intention to

1195
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,760
divorce Nintendo after many faithful years of devotion to each and every

1196
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,680
Nintendo console that has been released. After investing many years of my life

1197
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:01,400
playing the great library of classic games including a substantial financial

1198
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:05,560
investment, I feel my relationship with the Wii is drawing to a close. We made it

1199
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:08,640
past the rough patch a few years ago with the GameCube and yes I admit I did

1200
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,640
cheat on Nintendo with Microsoft and bought an Xbox. I've already apologized

1201
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:16,760
for this affair. It's in the past we moved on. And then the Wii came along and

1202
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:20,800
life was good again. We had such good times together with Zelda, Metroid and

1203
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,960
Mario but there was something wrong, something nagging in the back of my mind.

1204
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:27,560
Could it be all the shovelware that was becoming more and more common? Could it

1205
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:31,200
be all the ported games with waggle attached for no fucking reason? Could it

1206
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,880
be last year's E3? Could it be all the party games? What's next? Motion control?

1207
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:40,800
Yaris? The answer to all these questions is yes. You just don't seem to be trying

1208
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,040
anymore Nintendo. Do you care? I waited and waited watching this year's E3 for a

1209
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:50,680
sign that you still cared but no you let me down yet again. Why should I stay? What

1210
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:54,240
can you offer me as a reason to hang around? Why shouldn't I just go and sell

1211
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:58,160
my Wii and put the money towards a PlayStation 3? More Mario Galaxy you

1212
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,560
lazy bastards that's just fat you trimmed from Galaxy One. Mario multiplayer

1213
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,600
ported from the DS. Zelda? A painting? A frickin poster? And they said the Zelda

1214
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,080
game actually is not gonna be very different than the first one which means

1215
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,400
it's gonna be raining on the same engine. I'm reading this poor man's please

1216
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:19,360
to the divorce court. A statement about no sword? That's it? Get fucked! Kid IKEA

1217
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:25,320
RS? Oh there oh it's there it's coming news flash we don't care anymore. At the

1218
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,920
end of the day I'm going to be a dad soon and my time will be a precious

1219
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,320
commodity. I need to know that you are taking things seriously if not I'm

1220
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:36,160
walking to the nearest Sony store. It's so sad. You used to try so hard and

1221
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,280
produce such wonderful gaming experiences. You were top of the pile now

1222
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:43,880
you're more bothered about coming on to my grandmother and small children. You

1223
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:51,640
disgust me Nintendo. Regards Rick. P.S. I get custody of the Nintendog. Well we will

1224
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:55,400
see how that holds up in divorce court with judge who is it in divorce court

1225
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:59,400
Judge Mabel? He's Judge Mabel. Of course if he's in the UK he's not even gonna

1226
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:04,160
get that joke so forget it. All right that was a well-written divorce letter

1227
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:09,240
and I can't say I it's tough it's tough being a hardcore gaming fan and watching

1228
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:13,200
what's going on with the Wii but at the same time I think he summed it up right

1229
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,480
at the end they're more interested in hitting on your grandmother and little

1230
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:21,240
children and they're doing a good job of it you can't deny that but you know

1231
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,880
we're just not the bread and butter for Nintendo anymore maybe Nintendo felt

1232
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,360
they already lost us between the 64 and the GameCube. I don't know. Well wait not

1233
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:33,400
to try. But my thought is a lot of us were children or at least younger when

1234
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:37,480
those systems were out I mean wouldn't you I don't know. The problem is they're

1235
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:45,440
kind of catering to stupid people but they think that people like they're oh

1236
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:49,200
my god you know games are so hard I can't play them well you give it to a

1237
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:55,080
kid you know he's gonna figure it out I mean I was a kid I figured out how

1238
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:58,600
to play video games you know it may not have been I may not have been good at it

1239
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:03,040
at first but it took time I had to practice get better and you know

1240
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,360
nowadays I think kids should do the same thing because if they're just

1241
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:10,360
immediately great at it then good that gives them a self-esteem boost but they

1242
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:16,280
still suck it's just the game is really easy. Now I'm looking in chat and some

1243
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:21,040
folks want the emailer to understand about Metroid Other M they neglected in

1244
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:25,480
their whole little statement there but J-Rod offered up this interesting

1245
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:29,040
retort I can think of at least three games from both Sony and Microsoft for me

1246
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,520
three that I want on day one Nintendo had one game during a two-hour

1247
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:38,720
conference. Yeah that is true so but I mean does look cool. Metroid M does look

1248
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:41,960
sweet. They just need like ten more of those. And here's the thing though

1249
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:47,640
okay is it looks cool but is it actually gonna be cool? We'll see we'll give them

1250
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:52,760
the benefit of the doubt we'll see but again they need ten of those. Yeah they

1251
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:56,960
really do need more hits throughout the year I mean because I'm sorry but you

1252
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,080
know people will probably be dumb enough to buy New Super Mario Brothers Wii

1253
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:05,640
because it's got Mario in the name and because some parents are like oh my god

1254
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,600
Mario I gotta buy it you know and they don't know anything about it could be

1255
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:14,400
Mario teaches Sudoku and they would probably buy that crap but I don't know.

1256
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:18,240
Email number two tonight of five emails we got a few to burn through tonight

1257
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,160
email number two comes to us from serious turtle this is a very serious

1258
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:25,560
turtle we need to take this very seriously guys a couple months ago I

1259
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:29,280
discovered podcast alley and thus your show I forgot we were listed on podcast

1260
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:36,920
alley that's an old-school podcast podcast exactly oh my lucky stars I've

1261
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:41,200
been needing a show like this my whole life I don't have any friends who are

1262
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:44,440
hardcore gamers like me so when I heard your show it was fantastic to hear

1263
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:47,520
people like me who talked about the things I care about thanks for all the

1264
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,600
time you invest in the show and tell Loki to stop yelling the turtle sorry I

1265
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:58,200
have a problem look this this serious turtle has it has a serious issue with

1266
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,280
you Loki and that is that you yell too damn much I got to talk to you that's

1267
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:05,440
something this is great oh no totally go on a tangent but oh alright funny fine

1268
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:11,480
so apparently earlier this week Nellie was convinced that I had Asperger's

1269
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:17,560
syndrome isn't that kind of like it's like autism okay so she so your wife

1270
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:22,960
thinks you're autistic yes yes because apparently people stricken with Asperger's

1271
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:28,120
they have the tendency to be very focused on certain things or whatever

1272
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:33,400
basically you know I piss her off a lot by like going on my computer and working

1273
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,520
on something for a while and not realizing what I'm doing not realizing

1274
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,680
it's making her angry and some of that and there is a lot of times that I do

1275
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:43,440
that and I don't realize it's making her angry I don't really cuz in my mind it

1276
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:47,260
justify like oh okay well I hung out with her quite a bit in stuff but you

1277
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:51,640
know I guess it's not the right time to be doing that or something like that or

1278
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:56,160
like all randomly blurred out stuff like like at your party or something there's

1279
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:59,560
people talking about something and somehow I found a way to work in games

1280
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:04,080
in there and I blurted out something completely random about like you know

1281
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:07,480
like they're talking about like some song may hear something, hey that song is in

1282
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:11,080
rock band you know it's supposed to be coming out in a few weeks on you know

1283
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:14,880
download content or something it's like no one cares but you know for whatever

1284
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,760
reason I feel compelled to do that all the time and I can't stop myself you

1285
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:25,320
just this show just isn't enough Loki you've spent seven years okay you've

1286
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,960
spent at least seven years of your life getting the gaming knowledge out there

1287
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:33,000
in a way this radio station is perfect for you I don't think it's as per I

1288
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
don't know go to a doctor and no no there's no it there's nothing that has

1289
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,320
to do that because it's actually you're very socially you know unable to cope

1290
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:46,040
with everything basically you can't well I think there's a function in society

1291
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,640
we're not medical professionals not even gonna try and get into it but it's you

1292
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:52,280
know it was funny because there's a lot of symptoms on there and they're like

1293
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:55,940
they're different work fields that would be perfect okay but look you go into web

1294
01:35:55,940 --> 01:36:00,480
MD like yeah and you tell web MD you have certain symptoms I've got this and

1295
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:04,580
this and this this every time it tells you cancer every time you go in there

1296
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:08,300
and you're like oh I've got cancer I've got a rash on my ass and it kind of you

1297
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:15,960
know it flames love oh you have ass cancer you know like or like or yeah

1298
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:22,080
you're all yes or no it's not the Tuma anyway sorry to get off on tangent there

1299
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:29,680
I just thought it was funny all right next email yes please next email stop

1300
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:34,000
trying to talk about things you know nothing about all right this comes to us

1301
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,240
from death wishing I feel like I have not been involved in your shows for a

1302
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:42,320
long time have I missed a lot yes anyways now to get on with some email

1303
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:46,080
material have you guys ever heard of a game called urban terror well if you

1304
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:49,760
have not then there is no reason to not try the game because because well it's

1305
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,080
absolutely free it was originally a quake 3 mod and then went into its own

1306
01:36:54,080 --> 01:37:00,080
standalone game I cannot describe how it plays but I guess it's a miss a miss I

1307
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,640
think a combination of counter-strike and quake hence it being a quake 3 mod

1308
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:09,240
well let's hope I don't miss the cast again I've never heard of this any urban

1309
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:15,360
terror so the only thing I've heard of there was a urban chaos or something

1310
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,040
like that game that was from idos or something that really sucked but that

1311
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:27,120
sounds kind of neat email number four from shook hi everyone I've been

1312
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,120
following this show for about three months and I can honestly say that this

1313
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,960
is the best video game related show I've ever listened to why thank you I

1314
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,960
encourage you guys to keep doing this show and if you're reading this on the

1315
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:39,120
seventh anniversary I wish to congratulate you on the feet well you're

1316
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,440
a week late but that's probably my fault because the seventh anniversary show

1317
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:45,280
still hasn't hit the feed but thank you nonetheless seventh anniversary or not

1318
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:49,240
we'll just say we'll say that's a pre grats for our eighth anniversary yeah

1319
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:54,280
there you go last email tonight from the one and only spazzinator hi everyone I

1320
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:58,240
thought I'd write this email for tonight show mainly to share a tidbit of info by

1321
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:01,280
the looks of things Sony will be doing three things more or less in tandem this

1322
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:06,080
summer rolling out the long rumor ps3 slim drop the price of the ps3 by an

1323
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:10,040
unknown amount and release firmware 3.0 which by most accounts will be a fairly

1324
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:12,800
big overhaul so I'm reading this email because we've addressed some of this but

1325
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,040
we didn't really talk about new firmware most sources agree that firmware 3.0 has

1326
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,480
certain features on it similar to what Xbox Live has reputation and griefing

1327
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:23,640
procedures as well as finally being able to download game updates in the

1328
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:27,280
background where there is still some debate as to whether or not firmware 3.0

1329
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:31,080
will also incorporate the recently uncovered patented ps2 emulator that

1330
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,640
will supposedly work on all ps3s my suspicions are that the emulator will

1331
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:39,000
indeed be coming most likely in firmware 3.0 or at least in the next major from

1332
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,840
where to firmware update after that my reasoning is this there's no reason for

1333
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:46,240
any company Sony or any other one to patent anything unless they see a way to

1334
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:49,720
make money off of it directly or indirectly seeing as the PlayStation 3

1335
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:54,080
sales have been lagging behind the Wii's in the 360s hell even the ps2s these

1336
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:57,320
moves that I've mentioned should in theory bolster sales which is

1337
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:00,680
ultimately what Sony and some third-party developers want ultimately

1338
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:04,400
this is all just hearsay educated guessing on my part until we see here

1339
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:09,320
something official however given my tracker record in as far as far as relaying

1340
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:13,280
info it's subsequently being true see a prior story I related regarding Capcom

1341
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,880
releasing games on PSN odds are this will be true proven true as well well

1342
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:21,080
that's a and it also bit of a it also makes sense to think about it kind of

1343
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:26,160
eases them into digital distribution with ps3 games because you have the ps2

1344
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,720
games coming out now and I'm assuming those are gonna be at a higher price

1345
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:32,600
point than the PlayStation 1 games were you know for the most part I would

1346
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:37,440
assume that they're gonna be maybe around you know 15 20 15 to I would say

1347
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:44,120
even 15 to like $30 maybe 15 25 ish and if that does well then of course and I

1348
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:49,120
mean hey let's release some PlayStation 3 games you know for more money as well

1349
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:56,200
and see if we can get away with selling those so I'm not I'm pretty sure we'll

1350
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,520
probably see this stuff layers here all right well let me finish up this email

1351
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,780
here on a personal note I do hope that at least the emulator part is shown to

1352
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:06,880
be true me too although I used to have a 60 gigabyte model PlayStation 3 with full

1353
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,480
backwards compatibility I no longer had that due to unfortunate circumstances

1354
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,680
and was forced to settle for a non backwards compatible model hopefully

1355
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:17,040
this emulator will allow me to play my ps2 games again well thanks for taking

1356
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,080
this email it's appreciated and keep up the excellent work this email was

1357
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:24,360
brought to you by Loki's tingle costume which kindly asks him to wear it lol

1358
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:28,260
thus ends the email back tonight mailbag orange launcher calm if you have an

1359
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:32,240
email you want to send us in a future week sorry I think we'll cost him I do

1360
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:37,880
believe that you are about 800,000 copies shy in other words yes I made the

1361
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:41,640
costume yet you're gonna have to get to like 50,000 it's never gonna happen

1362
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:45,280
they've stopped making the game it's done it's not gonna happen done deal you

1363
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:49,080
need yet now all of you should be focusing on a new bet you can get low

1364
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:54,000
you know I am not making any bets on the PSP go I'm sorry I don't know that's

1365
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,400
gonna do because there are a lot of to be honest you know I have a problem with

1366
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:01,360
people buying the iPhone because I think it's retarded but you know there are

1367
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:06,040
people out there that like to spend a lot of money on stuff that's kind of you

1368
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:09,240
guys are gonna have to think really hard and also Frisbee brings up a good point

1369
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:12,480
Sackboy costume was better anyway let's not forget Loki did dress up as

1370
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,600
Sackboy which is pretty exactly I have the head now in my garage I know it

1371
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:19,760
scared the hell out of me when I first saw it all right some more news then

1372
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:24,000
we'll get into some release dates and the FUs of the week as well let's see

1373
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:34,320
here so let's talk a little bit about Xbox 360 we've got last M they've got

1374
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:41,680
some information on that and how will be integrated into the new Xbox experience

1375
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:49,040
apparently elastic last FM is gonna be free for gold subscribers however if you

1376
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:56,200
are still remember you do get to use three hours per month and if you're a I

1377
01:41:56,200 --> 01:42:03,560
guess you'll have to shell out I guess another $36 a year if you're still

1378
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:08,280
remember and just want to use last FM which you might as well buy a fucking

1379
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:14,640
gold subscription points yeah might as well so apparently yes silver members

1380
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:20,760
will be able to access I guess trial period of three hours a month and comes

1381
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:25,040
with video advertising which might get into something else we'll talk about in

1382
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:29,600
just a second here and I thought is this isn't now my hope was that I'd be able

1383
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,880
to use last FM as my in-game music but that's not really what they're going for

1384
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:37,080
is it this is just gonna be like a cable channel or something I guess yeah I don't

1385
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:40,600
like the cable music channel instant party just add last FM or something I

1386
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:45,440
don't know like I've yet to really hear what is this used for I don't know I

1387
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:48,560
hope you can use like in-game music pretty cool that would be pretty cool

1388
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:53,040
actually is trying out you know the custom soundtracks with fuel the other

1389
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:58,080
day only two funny and it doesn't have the greatest soundtrack it really

1390
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:02,680
doesn't it's it's got what I like to call excite truck syndrome where you add

1391
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:08,400
new music to it instantly makes the game better you know yeah yeah so I don't

1392
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:14,120
know it it's alright but um I see I've never used last FM on PC so I don't

1393
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:17,240
really know if it's something that I'd be really excited about to be honest I

1394
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:21,520
mean I like listening to new music and discovering new artists and stuff but I

1395
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:26,800
don't think they have as eclectic tastes as I would have you know I don't know I

1396
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,600
guess I'll check it out I am a gold number so too bad it's not live through

1397
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:34,320
CC 5 instead of last FM I know right I'm saying something nice about life is

1398
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:39,760
CC 5 but seriously we might almost consider going back if they could have

1399
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:43,200
that on the Xbox marketplace how about we do shoutcast I know there you go how

1400
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:46,560
about shoutcast exactly then you can have all games radio on there and and

1401
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,800
which would include us of course and you know all the other great stations that

1402
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,640
come with shoutcast but I don't know maybe an IRC let's add IRC in there too

1403
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:58,680
and you won't need a PC you can just do it through the 360 exactly that's why I

1404
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:01,560
would love to have this show is be able to live I mean you can already hear it

1405
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:06,640
on your PSP which is cool but that's like one system out of a lot I guess

1406
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:11,840
it's one nice thing I could say about the PSP is that yeah by the way we

1407
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,240
wouldn't really go back to life this is five chat don't panic we're not really

1408
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:20,200
gonna do that besides you know what's funny is that since the show is actually

1409
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,120
kind of grown a little bit in numbers since we kind of combined with Bobby and

1410
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,800
we have some of the holdovers from his show and I know he gets a boost from us

1411
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,580
I don't think we could do the show on like these five anymore without being a

1412
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:31,880
professional station we have too many people which is a nice compliment

1413
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:36,840
certainly to you know the the listeners and the fact that the show has grown and

1414
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,840
we're very thankful for that we actually could not afford to do this show on

1415
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:44,880
like 365 anymore so don't worry that's not happening I was just making a bad

1416
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:54,680
joke sheesh so it's kind of surprising is to go off completely off topic from

1417
01:44:54,680 --> 01:45:01,040
that Blizzard apparently is not gonna be including land support of course with

1418
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:07,400
the Starcraft 2 game oh I heard about this and a lot of people pissed off

1419
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:13,520
because you know land is I mean how Starcraft 2 and your Starcraft 1 and I

1420
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,200
think when you're like counter-strike I mean those are land games right there

1421
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:20,800
and you know I know land play is a huge thing especially land parties you know

1422
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,800
like Korea and stuff and the centers the land party centers exactly well I mean

1423
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:29,320
they still have play over there you know battle net stuff but I mean it's not the

1424
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:32,920
same so you can still have a land party it's just that you're all gonna have to

1425
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:36,800
have an internet connection yeah which in this Wi-Fi day and age shouldn't be

1426
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:41,760
that difficult but still it is kind of crazy I mean if you think about it let

1427
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:46,680
there is more lag I think involved with you know that because you're not just

1428
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:52,120
you're playing off of a local network but I don't know that kind of sucks but

1429
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:56,320
basically you know Blizzard's responding to the whole you removal of it because

1430
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:00,720
everyone was pissed off there we don't currently plan to support land play in

1431
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:05,120
Starcraft 2 as we are building battle net to be the ideal destination for

1432
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:08,640
multiplayer gaming with Starcraft 2 and feature Blizzard entertainment games

1433
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:12,440
while this was a difficult decision for us we felt that moving away from land

1434
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:16,720
play and directing players to our upgrade bell net service was the best

1435
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:20,720
option to ensure a quality multiplayer experience with Starcraft 2 and

1436
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:26,640
safeguard against piracy as she went under madam chat says hell I'm having a

1437
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:32,960
party next week and we intend on playing mass Starcraft via LAN you know here's

1438
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,840
the thing though here's the thing it's not like you can't still get everyone in

1439
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:40,640
a room together and play this game together you just have to do it on the

1440
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:44,200
internet which I know kind of sucks and they want they want to do that so that

1441
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:48,360
it validates your copy exactly they're trying to it's piracy yeah they're

1442
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:53,040
trying to curb someone's gonna create a client that's gonna act like battle net

1443
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:56,320
that you'll connect to that and you'll be able to play land with and guess who

1444
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:59,520
will be doing that the pirates because they'll figure out a way around this I

1445
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,120
kind of agree Blizzard ought to know better than this the that they're gonna

1446
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:07,080
take it out and someone's gonna find a way to put it back in you know what I

1447
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:11,640
mean it's it they might as well just put it in there and just encourage people to

1448
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:17,800
buy the game legitimately you know have one computer on the land sneak onto the

1449
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:20,960
internet and see if the other copies are validated certainly there's a way this

1450
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:25,280
could be done certainly like if one computer like creeps onto the internet

1451
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:28,920
battle net could somehow it's kind of tell I don't know I'm just crazy and of

1452
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:32,440
course you know everyone's pissed off and what happens when people get pissed

1453
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:38,520
off they start a petition and so they have a petition created you know that's

1454
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:44,320
basically insisting that blizzard ad land support back I can't wait for that

1455
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:48,440
question to be asked at this year's Blizzcon because that is one interesting

1456
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:51,400
thing about this story is that oops they maybe should have waited to say

1457
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,400
something about this until after Blizzcon but they said something about

1458
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,680
it before so what's gonna be awesome is that now there's gonna be these big

1459
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:00,880
panels on Starcraft then when they take questions why the hell did you take out

1460
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:09,920
land support you douche can't wait next question because we did next question

1461
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:13,600
no they'll say they'll get blah blah blah well we think the marketplace is

1462
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,260
shifting and we just wanted to encourage folks to use battle net so that they

1463
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:20,700
could track their achievements and everything is statistic based and if we

1464
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:23,920
do the land then we can't have that you're gonna get some talk around

1465
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:30,880
the answer just wait yeah just wait let's talk a little bit about the Dreamcast

1466
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:35,560
yes Dreamcast is of course getting yet another game and much like the

1467
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:39,560
other you know new games for the Dreamcast that have been coming out

1468
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:46,160
recently is another shmup game the brand-new 2d shoot-em-up game named

1469
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:56,480
ducks do you X and it's actually being sold I guess right now for $27.90 I'm not

1470
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,760
sure if it's gonna be a disk space game or not I guess it could be since you

1471
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:07,160
know Dreamcast can pretty much read any sort of burn disk and apparently I guess

1472
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:13,720
they have another game that's also coming out as well the company Hugh cast

1473
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:22,120
and it's I guess the title is last hope pink bullets which I guess was

1474
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:29,600
co-developed by the shins hmm which Wow not heard of any of these things

1475
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:36,120
apparently that's actually like the shins like the band the shins huh

1476
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:42,760
interesting but yeah I mean it's it's still nice to see I guess games coming

1477
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:48,360
out for the Dreamcast prequel all right well you know what guys I think it's

1478
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:51,480
time to I get into the F use of the week we wouldn't want to forget it this week

1479
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:54,920
so we got to get into the F use of the week and of course the story that

1480
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:58,480
inspires our angst this week

1481
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:17,160
this has to do with the case of the stolen we this week three teens Josh

1482
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:22,280
Carter and a 16 year old and a 13 year old were all arrested on felony charges

1483
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:25,920
this week because they stole their neighbors we well here's the thing the

1484
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:32,760
mother 41 year old Maxine law actually helped them get rid of the we at a local

1485
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:37,280
pawn shop she knew damn well the thing was stolen so they stole this thing from

1486
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:41,600
the neighbor and then the parents or the mom I should say parents mom helped them

1487
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:47,520
sell it off at a local pawn shop it was being reported by WF TV in Orlando the

1488
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,760
Maxine law will probably be charged with dealing in stolen property and

1489
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:56,080
contributing to the delinquency of minors you should know better you stupid

1490
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:02,960
that makes me angry low-key F use the week I guess F you did not have enough

1491
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:08,480
time to play games and being broke more or less

1492
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:12,880
I don't really have a lot of F use this week I'm generally feeling pretty good

1493
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,760
so I guess I would just also give an F you to not having enough hours in the

1494
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,760
day to play video games and F you to Facebook games for being so stupidly

1495
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:21,760
addicting

1496
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:28,800
alright let's move on with some more gaming news we got release dates to get

1497
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,120
to two will get to those in a little bit after another couple stories

1498
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:35,640
let's talk about some free games a free yes free is good and these are actually

1499
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:40,080
some pretty good free games both happen to be fighting games on the first one is

1500
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:46,880
a game called vanguard princess and I guess it's a 2d freeware fighter game

1501
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:55,600
developed by a looks like a Tomohaki Sugeno and apparently he is an ex cap

1502
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:59,840
com employee and the game looks pretty sweet actually you know definitely on

1503
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:04,320
par with like something like guilty gear even and that's available for download

1504
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:14,000
apparently off of a website www.vector.co.jp that's vector and just do a

1505
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:22,440
search for I guess vanguard princess and also the kind of go along with that is a

1506
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:31,520
game called dark presence and dark presence is a digitized fighting game

1507
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:36,680
very similar to the old Mortal Kombat games and like like Street Fighter the

1508
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:40,040
movie the game where they actually captured the the faces of people they're

1509
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:44,120
making a new game like this yes that is freaking awesome and actually I take

1510
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:51,520
that back this is not a not a free game but apparently new arcade game is not a

1511
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:58,760
new arcade game that's pretty awesome so wow that looks really crappy if it's

1512
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:01,880
an arcade game I don't know well I was reading something about like it's got

1513
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:05,360
more animation I guess than any game like it has ever existed so it's

1514
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:08,280
supposed to be a smoother looking game then you know the Mortal Kombat games

1515
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:11,320
were which I would hope you know I've been it has been many years the

1516
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:15,520
technology hopefully to me it looks like one of those cheesy like games that you

1517
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,280
would see in a movie or something like that when they're trying to create a

1518
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:22,360
game in the movie that you know supposed to represent like a Mortal Kombat type

1519
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:27,960
ish game you know something really low-budget but hey whatever if it comes

1520
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:31,760
out and turns out be cool you know hey Mortal Kombat at the time I think you

1521
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:36,800
know it looks sort of cheesy on a certain level so yeah more power to him

1522
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:41,040
all right let's get into release dates shall we we're gonna travel around the

1523

pretty busy Major League Baseball 2009 also makes way the PlayStation 2 this

1534
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:34,680

01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:39,000
big thing in Japan this week you get some new peripherals for the DS some

1536

1543
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:17,880
like this is a big week for baseball in Japan but otherwise nothing else to

1544
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:23,040
really note how about the u.s. u.s. there isn't really a lot of stuff coming out

1545
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:27,200
this week pretty much your big release is gonna be the bigs 2 which is coming

1547
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:48,560

1548
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:53,960

01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:58,600
kit in the box I don't know if you're a mom maybe that might be interesting for

a little birthday parties for your kids also this week we've got a port of a

1551
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,960
game that came out in the UK Sid the dummy which is a crash dummy game

1552
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:17,960
something that would have probably been popular like 20 years ago coming on PSP

1553
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:23,320
ps2 and the Wii we release a Bioshock and Elder Scrolls for oblivion kind of

1554
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:29,560
combined together in the bundle for PC and Xbox 360 the packaged version of

1555
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:33,360
Arma 2 coming on PC which is supposed to be pretty sweet

1556
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:40,160
memento mori on PC and then coming out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network

1557
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:47,600

1558
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:52,440
of the new tales of monkey island series tales of monkey island chapter 1 launch

1559
01:56:52,440 --> 01:57:01,520

1560
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:05,360
is supposed to be coming out on ps3 as well on the PlayStation Network this

1561
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:13,320
week as well so not really a huge huge week no not really next week I mean July

1562
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:17,680
is really slow for game releases I think next week we've got like NCAA football

1563
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:22,360
2010 so if you're in the college football that'd be good for you but it

1564
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:25,280
really not a lot of big stuff I think at the end of the month course king of

1565
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:28,760
fires 12 so that'd be cool this time of year is usually a little slow isn't it

1566
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:34,280
it's always slow a little bit hey how about the release dates over in Europe

1567
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:37,320
since star soccer is not here tonight allow me to say that in Europe you can

1568
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:40,240
look forward to some of the downloads that we get this week as well tales of

1574
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:06,920
1 8 7 7 game olr to take your calls tonight on anything you want to talk

1575
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:16,120
about apparently according to Sesame Street video games are ok according to

1576
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:21,720
Sesame Street so as opposed to according to joystick or destructoid or Kotaku or

1577
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:26,000
one of the big game blogs this week it's according to Sesame Street yes

1578
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:33,340
apparently I see let's see apparently a game changer report issued by Joan

1579
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:38,400
Ganz Clooney Center from the Sesame Workshop basically says that

1580
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:42,360
governments the health care industry and schools should be spending less time

1581
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:47,160
hating on video games and their negative effort our native negative effects and

1582
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:51,360
said be conducting research on their positive effects on kids the port says

1583
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:55,680
that games not only can be educational but in this day and age active as well

1584
01:58:55,680 --> 01:59:00,800
meaning they can be used everywhere from a history classroom to a PE class and of

1585
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:07,440
course you know they're all saying the Joan Ganz Clooney Center is to foster

1586
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:11,280
innovation and children's learning through digital media so that's their

1587
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:18,760
kind of did you hear that Jack Voldemort you listening and yeah that's kind of

1588
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:26,960
neat I hope we get a song about it that Elmo sings video games okay just do your

1589
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:32,280
homework then you can play hopefully Elmo will never have to explain to

1590
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:36,400
children what teabagging is in halo

1591
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:42,520
there's some contest there in there that I want to do about who can write the

1592
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:50,600
best Sesame Street song for something obscene in gaming nice oh my gosh gold

1593
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:53,520
anthro and chat says another reason that says me Street is awesome first the

1594
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:56,160
death episode and now video games kind of talking about something we talked

1595
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:57,800
about last week

1596
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:01,440
all right hey by the way speaking of media I don't know if you guys heard

1597
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:05,880
about this but apparently they want to make a movie out of asteroids yes ah the

1598
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:10,920
old-ass fucking game from 1979 that many of you know from the Atari 2600

1599
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:17,000
asteroids Universal has somehow gotten the rights to make asteroids the Matthew

1600
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:21,720
Lopez is writing the script it's being produced by Lorenzo de Bonaventura who's

1601
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:27,160
I know produce some other stuff this is the weird thing apparently they're

1602
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:30,720
universal is making a lot of movies of some weird shit right now like they they

1603
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:34,160
have the rights to some Hasbro games like battleship in candy land are

1604
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:38,800
supposed to be coming movies as well yeah they picked up a lot of Hasbro stuff

1605
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:42,280
oh you know what where I've heard Lorenzo de Bonaventura before he's

1606
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:46,720
producing that GI Joe movie that's coming out next pretty big movie so it's

1607
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:50,080
not like these are no-name people but well you know pretty big movie but it's

1608
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:53,760
also gonna be a pretty big flop you think so then again then again

1609
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:58,520
transformers has a lot of horrible things going for it and it's still did

1610
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:04,600
very well so who knows by the way the script writer Matthew Lopez had wrote

1611
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:09,120
the movies bedtime stories and race to which mountain and is also wrote the

1612
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:14,080
most recent draft of the sorcerers apprentice there you have it I don't

1613
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:19,280
know about that you know I don't know as long as I mean where where's the movie

1614
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:22,320
in the game I think it there it's not even gonna have a damn thing to do with

1615
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:26,280
the game it's gonna be a space movie called asteroids whoop-dee-doo and what

1616
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:29,840
is it gonna be trying to be true oh my god I shot the asteroid and it turned

1617
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:36,000
into two smaller asteroids oh no quick shoot the UFO for bonus points it should

1618
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,720
be funnier for those space invaders tiger contest says there's already an

1619
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:43,840
asteroids movie it's called Armageddon yeah but Armageddon is actually like 10

1620
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:47,400
years old now believe it or not it's kind of an old movie now and they did

1621
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:51,400
time for an update blow up the way to make it multiple asteroids leave yeah I

1622
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:55,520
guess that's true please no dancing animal crackers in the asteroids movie

1623
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:01,160
please no Ben Affleck thank you very much how about we have how many more

1624
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:05,200
stories you have maybe one more for the skype line two more I don't know I don't

1625
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:08,080
know let's do one more then we'll open up the skype line if you want to fill

1626
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:15,360
time with those stories we can okay let's see well I'm not really sad about

1627
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:20,520
this but apparently NetErosy is being shut down Sony is pulling the plug on

1628
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:24,440
the PlayStation 1 development community they're gonna still keep all the

1629
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:28,440
libraries and stuff online but I guess it's officially shut down but honestly

1630
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:32,680
they'll still developing stuff on the PlayStation 1 I mean then again I do say

1631
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:35,200
that in and there are people developing on the Dreamcast but you know what I

1632
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,520
think all the people that were developing for the PlayStation 1 should

1633
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:40,160
move to the Dreamcast you know because that's the one that seems to be you

1634
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:43,160
know supported the most and they have a lot of communities for that and stuff

1635
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:46,440
but well for what it's worth you can play a PlayStation 1 game on the

1636
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:51,000
PlayStation 3 at least there's that yeah but you can't actually you know publish

1637
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,840
any more PlayStation 1 games and really can only swap you know the games you

1638
02:02:54,840 --> 02:03:00,000
make with the NetErosy with the other NetErosy users and I remember there was

1639
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,640
a time that actually wanted a NetErosy but that didn't happen I was about 15

1640
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:07,960
years ago all right let's go to the phones they're ringing already one eight

1641
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:10,760
seven seven game olr if you'd like to be on the show tonight but in the meantime

1642
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:14,480
we have the call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the guy in

1643
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:18,760
East Coast with the fastest trigger Rama hi Rama how are you doing I'm pretty

1644
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:24,760
good pretty good what cons you go to this week to as I said the tiger claw I

1645
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:29,560
didn't go to any conventions this week I only do the ones are on East Coast I see

1646
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:32,760
and of course anime expos the big deal on the West Coast this week which by the

1647
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:38,160
way I should say something about this our staffer DJ tyrant Jimmy who used to

1648
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:44,120
host a show on our old network with DMN I keep this breast lol now they used to

1649
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:47,280
host a show together called STFU he writes for our website once in a while

1650
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:51,000
now he actually got some interviews at anime expo I believe we're gonna have

1651
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,720
the developers of blaze blue on next week in an interview he did so it's

1652
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:58,680
gonna be weird because it's not an interview we did but we're all about

1653
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:02,520
getting cool like statements from folks that develop games so I'm gonna kind of

1654
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:05,440
take a listen and and pick the parts we're gonna air next week and then you

1655
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:10,760
get the unedited version on the website there you go that's pretty cool but I

1656
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:17,800
will say this for the record ax is not a con it's a trade show it's a you know

1657
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:22,760
what I saw ads for anime Expo up here in Sacramento that's how huge that frickin

1658
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:28,000
thing is well they roll ads for New York anime festival here in New York and on

1659
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,680
on on Adult Swim I'm just saying it's considered a trade show because their

1660
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:37,360
board is consistent mostly people in the anime industry I see and they're mostly

1661
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:42,280
sponsoring the con itself so that it's not fan produced it's pretty much that's

1662
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:46,520
why Fana may always kind of puts that big fan that they really sell their

1663
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:51,640
thing on fan made fan produced for the past so many years yeah most cons I've

1664
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:56,840
gone to especially ones I've staffed and mostly fan based cool well that's cool

1665
02:04:56,840 --> 02:05:03,240
yeah and I'm sorry I would say all the good cons are fan base but um e3 is

1666
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:07,040
pretty awesome for a trade show so trade shows aren't all bad anyway sorry oh no

1667
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:10,720
go ahead what else did you want to call in about tonight there's a few things

1668
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:15,600
that you spoke of tonight wanted to um throw back at you if you don't mind sure

1669
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:23,000
all right in response earlier about the Sony PSP go and the price as I've been

1670
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:28,040
saying in the chat room for the longest you're paying for the name not the

1671
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:34,680
product Sony has become the IBM of now cuz back in the 80s and 90s IBM

1672
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:39,320
machines were quite expensive but people bought his name IBM was on it but the

1673
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:43,840
only difference was at the time IBM made good quality product Sony not so much

1674
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:48,880
Sony is not Apple they need to realize that Apple can get away with that Sony

1675
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:54,680
can't I know cuz I don't know if you ever noticed um if you ever pick up like

1676
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:59,240
the Best Buy flyers or when Circuit City was still around in their flyers they're

1677
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:04,560
always pushing the ps3s with the Sony televisions if you bought the Sony TV

1678
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:11,560
and the ps3 $200 instant savings or if you bought that with rock band or guitar

1679
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:17,920
hero world tour you save $300 off the complete bundle hmm it's gotten to the

1680
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:22,720
point where Sony cannot sell the ps3 anyway in order for them to push them

1681
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:26,840
out they got a bundle it with something you know I'm reading some interesting

1682
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:30,120
comments from chat room chat that orange laundry calm j-rod and chat says I plan

1683
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:34,920
on buying a PSP go on day one that thing looks pimp as hell don't get me wrong I

1684
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:39,240
think the PSP go looks pretty cool but since I already have PSP there's just

1685
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:43,200
not enough in it for me I don't know I'm not feeling it for two and I would be

1686
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:47,800
all over that fucking thing if it was like 150 even exactly the same price as

1687
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:52,680
the current PSP I would be all over it but it's the it's that 250 it's ah I

1688
02:06:52,680 --> 02:07:00,080
can't I can't do it I'm sorry mmm anyway I don't blame you seriously I don't

1689
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:04,840
yeah but you're Sony hater I'm just kidding no I just speak the truth you

1690
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:07,440
know that all right look anything else before I let you go and get some more

1691
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:12,320
callers two quick things number one at the we was all about motion control

1692
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:16,640
would have a shit ton of shovelware games on and as for Starcraft 2 you

1693
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:20,720
don't have a shit ton of shovelware games on it where have you been say what

1694
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:24,040
it does have a shit ton of shovelware games on it where have you been say if

1695
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:26,960
it wasn't for the fact that it was focused on the motion control there

1696
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:31,720
wouldn't be as much shovelware oh okay my bad my bad yeah gotcha I'm oh I've

1697
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:36,040
been told it's only like two games I own for the week every all the other ones I'd

1698
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:43,240
borrowed cuz you know yeah and what was the other thing I'm all about Starcraft

1699
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:46,720
you're not needing land support it doesn't cost that much to put in a internet

1700
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:52,160
connection a router and a 24 port switch to get everybody up and running together

1701
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:57,600
does it do you think it's really gonna have that same feeling though well if

1702
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:01,320
they do it where you log in via the application it shouldn't be that much of

1703
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:05,560
an issue because it milk I have the same lag time as if you're in the same room

1704
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:10,680
you know no depends on who's hosting or all that crap you know I guess true true

1705
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:16,400
all right well thanks for your thoughts Rama and good luck from later j-rod I

1706
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:20,400
wanted to clarify we were saying earlier he says I don't own a PSP so that's why

1707
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:24,360
it's probably so attractive to me yeah I'd be I'd probably be a little more

1708
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:31,880
about the PSP if I didn't already own one but still 250 I don't know hi you're

1709
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:42,480
on orange launch radio who's this hello you're on orange hello hi who's this

1710
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:51,200
hi who is this is Marissa yes hi what's on your mind Marissa

1711
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:57,480
well thanks again I just had to say a belated congrats for last week I wasn't

1712
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:01,200
able to listen in although I heard it was a good show it was a pretty good

1713
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:04,160
show it sadly hasn't hit the podcast feed because I'm a lazy son of a bitch

1714
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:07,480
but it will be hitting it very soon and you guys can hear was that it was a

1715
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:12,320
kind of a little bit of a throwback to the old days it was cool yeah you know

1716
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:18,440
as far as my own gaming week this this fourth of July weekend consisted of

1717
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:25,200
watching Chris play Call of Duty and and how is that is this is this fun to watch

1718
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:31,320
just play you know actually for some reason it puts me to sleep I don't know

1719
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:34,680
what it is the sound of killing and bullets but I just curl up like a cat in

1720
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:38,800
front of his feet and I fall asleep all the sounds of murder just make me

1721
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:47,440
tired yeah I've actually distracted myself with that old you know you're

1722
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:51,920
talking about people doing doing you know making games for Dreamcast and

1723
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:57,560
whatnot no systems I distracted myself with Adam all the adventure game engine

1724
02:09:57,560 --> 02:10:02,560
and was playing an alien race game oh yeah the one you linked me to that

1725
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:09,760
looks kind of freaky-deaky but tell us a little bit about this game alien rape

1726
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:14,280
escape or something if you know me I love all the old adventure games oh well

1727
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:18,520
how do you feel about the new monkey island game coming out I haven't even

1728
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:22,480
heard about that to you now so that's cool you know I never got into monkey

1729
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:26,600
island even I was younger you know I love a king's quest people and the

1730
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:30,600
quest for glory people get mad at me but and Indiana Jones or the state of

1731
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:36,040
Atlantis person but I try to remember that the state of Atlantis is going to

1732
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:40,960
be bundled with the new indie game whoo yeah that's right yeah I remember us

1733
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:43,920
reporting on the show a few weeks ago that it was gonna be coming on the Wii

1734
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:46,280
with the game or something like that someday I don't know if it was a

1735
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:50,480
pre-order it's been a while now but I I do I did hear that same thing on the

1736
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:55,120
show I'm still obsessing over the announcement now we made that a new

1737
02:10:55,120 --> 02:10:59,280
feast is going to come out but I hadn't just praying every night that I don't

1738
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:08,600
fuck it up isn't how it always goes with old franchises though when they

1739
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:11,160
announce that there's a new one coming out you just pray that they're not gonna

1740
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:16,240
fuck it up yeah well I guess the thing is like one of those took over for

1741
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:19,880
looking glass although I didn't I actually like the X you know via the

1742
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:23,760
platform game the Xbox game at deadly shadows most of the purists didn't like

1743
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:28,600
it and it gets started out kind of lame because they called it a thief with a

1744
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:34,560
four instead of the odd or something and suddenly like that so it's like four

1745
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:38,760
four something now I don't know how to pronounce it but I guess it's just a

1746
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:45,080
working title indeed well Marissa I need to come visit us soon and come be on the

1747
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:49,440
show again I'm hoping that'll happen and you have anything else you want to share

1748
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:53,960
with listeners tonight before we get to some more calls nothing that wouldn't be

1749
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:59,520
sublimely silly so I have have a good night and hopefully I will be seeing you

1750
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:08,880
feeling and you need to call so-and-so all right we'll do honey take care I think

1751
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:13,760
I think we lost her there we go okay well I do hope Marissa comes back to

1752
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:16,400
visit it's been like a hundred episodes since she's been here she's a lot of fun

1753
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:19,240
I've been that long she's like it's I know we've been doing the show a fucking

1754
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:22,600
long time I don't know if you're aware we have another call coming on hi you're

1755
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:25,200
on orange launch radio oops we didn't really answer that call hi you're on

1756
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:30,280
orange launch radio who's this hi this is fancy Nader hi spazz Nader what's on

1757
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:36,360
your mind tonight um two things which are kind of related to some degree go

1758
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:42,280
ahead all right you know I was you know you know you know thinking about that

1759
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:49,080
comment you were making about you know someone's making asteroids movie yes

1760
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:54,440
question is how the hell do you make a movie on the asteroid there's like no

1761
02:12:54,440 --> 02:13:02,560
narratives there I mean I can I I can see a movie being here like I'm charted

1762
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:09,000
or no dear salad there's a narrative there but easy the same way the same way

1763
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,320
dude they're making movies out of battleship in candy land they are movies

1764
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:17,840
in name only or Pirates of the Caribbean there was really no plot to it you know

1765
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:21,760
in the ride but they managed to make three movies and they actually were

1766
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:25,400
pretty good now asteroid could be something similar where they just make

1767
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:28,200
up characters and then now those characters are associated with that

1768
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:31,680
franchise so and maybe that's what they want to do maybe it's type of agreement

1769
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:36,200
where if they could do a good movie then they can re-release the asteroid game

1770
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:39,640
with the characters in it just like they ended up going back and putting the

1771
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:43,360
characters in the ride or more importantly had huge amounts of

1772
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:46,680
merchandising with the parrot Pirates of the Caribbean movies I mean that the you

1773
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:49,600
know Jack Sparrow figures still sell like crazy and you see tons of them at

1774
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:54,200
Halloween you know he's a he's a universally loved character so I guess

1775
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:56,920
that's a good point I didn't even think about if they do write the movie well

1776
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:00,600
enough there there will be an audience for it but there's just not a lot of

1777
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:03,920
source material to base it off of what do we know about the asteroid movie it

1778
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:07,600
will be about asteroids there will probably be shooting of said asteroids

1779
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:12,960
that's it that's all the script requires in some ways it's guaranteed to piss

1780
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:16,240
people off less than like the Harry Potter movies like how many people

1781
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:20,000
hated the third Harry Potter movie because of all the shit they cut out

1782
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:26,280
sometimes it's nice to have a very thin narrative but I wouldn't you know I my

1783
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:30,520
expectations for this movie are not going to be I guess that high because of

1784
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:34,080
the fact there's no narrative to base it off of if that makes sense I don't know

1785
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:41,120
well it could very well be good you know for all I know obviously I haven't seen

1786
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:47,240
it so I can't be sure but you know I could be a little skeptical you know to

1787
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:50,520
say the least well we should be skeptical it's ten dollars and twenty

1788
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:54,280
five cents of our money we're gonna be spending on the movies anyway what was

1789
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:58,880
the other thing you want to mention tonight oh yeah I forgot to mention in

1790
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:04,400
my email because I can't really mention you know I wrote it but uh I kept it

1791
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:11,640
notes earlier earlier this week and on the PlayStation Network store the only

1792
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:17,720
time that the video site they got a reasonably new or new for the store

1793
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:23,160
enemy series that may be appealing to some of the listeners out there it's a

1794
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:32,440
devil may cry series mm-hmm and well I got popped up the first episode to try

1795
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:38,320
it out and for one thing it looks pretty good I don't know about the entire

1796
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:45,040
series as a whole but just based on the first episode it looks pretty good so I

1797
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:49,640
don't know if any of the listening wants to check it out or you guys but really

1798
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:53,600
start the first ones you know worth checking out you know that's one thing I

1799
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:57,160
have yet to do on the Sony marketplace is check out one of the TV shows or

1800
02:15:57,160 --> 02:16:01,400
something but that's cool I know they've been kind of releasing some more anime

1801
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:03,920
and things like that sort of like there's a whole Street Fighter store now

1802
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:06,760
and on the PlayStation 3 I was checking out this week and they actually have

1803
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:11,440
like the Street Fighter anime and some of that stuff so kind of different yeah

1804
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:18,620
I think I mentioned in a previous email going back several weeks ago that I had

1805
02:16:18,620 --> 02:16:27,840
recommended the first angel anime series I happen to have all 24 episodes and at

1806
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:33,480
least that series is very good it's kind of how to describe it's like a cross

1807
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:39,420
between actually has certain elements of specs files and a little bit of

1808
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:48,080
Charlie's Angels mixed in yeah it's kind of odd but in a good way definitely

1809
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:51,440
definitely worth checking out and that's a bit is that available on on Sony's

1810
02:16:51,440 --> 02:17:04,520
marketplace yeah yeah it is I think I can't you know remember the name of the

1811
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:10,040
developer but you know it's not funimation right and that's for sure but

1812
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:14,200
it's pretty good all right I will definitely have to check that out on the

1813
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:17,040
marketplace at some point but thank you so much for the call spaz nator you have

1818
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:40,320
call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this is excellent hi

1819
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:44,320
excellent what's on your mind buddy hey hey I have a quick question for you

1820
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:48,760
guys how can a developer bring out a PC version of a game that's really great

1821
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:52,320
and really good but yet have so many buggy and lot of cool issues it's not

1822
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:55,760
even funny to even start to mention how many stuff there is wrong with the game

1823
02:17:55,760 --> 02:18:00,320
are you saying it's a PC game that came out yeah Ghostbusters a video game the

1824
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:05,560
PC version is absolutely horrid easy it's not I mean there's so many complaints

1825
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:09,720
from so many people they're not even issuing any patches or they're not

1826
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:13,360
issuing any kind of you know saying hey look we were sorry we're trying to get

1827
02:18:13,360 --> 02:18:19,840
on this super duper super duper easy answer for you and what the one kind of

1828
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,200
problem that I suppose that PC games have in general is that there is not the

1829
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:29,620
same quality control that you have on the PlayStation or the Microsoft system

1830
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:33,700
or even the Nintendo system is that these games go through no quality

1831
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:38,680
control remember when way back when they used to have the Nintendo seal of

1832
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:43,240
quality yes the Nintendo seal quality had nothing to do with the fact whether

1833
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:46,480
the game was any good or not it just had to do with the fact that the game had

1834
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:49,960
been officially tested was officially licensed and approved for the system and

1835
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:53,920
usually the games that were like really prone to bugs and had really bad

1836
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:56,680
ingression a lot of really bad things wrong with them were these games that

1837
02:18:56,680 --> 02:19:01,160
came out from color dreams and the other makers attention and makers that wanted

1838
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:04,840
nothing to do in Nintendo kind of moving on from that now you have a lot of these

1839
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:08,440
companies where you can't even really put the games out on the system unless

1840
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:12,720
you go through these rigid tests you know a quality control you know and it's

1841
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:19,600
it's little as you know in like the Xbox games you have to have you know things

1842
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:23,440
have to be referred to as the r1 and the l1 or the back button in the start

1843
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:27,240
button and then the Sony games the X button and O button you know that you

1844
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:30,520
have to make sure everything is referred to by the proper name for it I mean it's

1845
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:34,480
down to that kind of level of control on the PC who's there to control those

1846
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:38,960
games what third-party entity has to look at those games and and review them

1847
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:43,200
nobody nobody's really watching that I think it should be more viewing done

1848
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:46,960
because like I said before I feel now I'm they kind of gypped out of my money

1849
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:50,560
for the game and how they're looking actually forward to playing it on the PC

1850
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:55,840
and it's like now to go out and find a way to get it for either the 360 now or

1851
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:00,040
the ps3 in full quality and tour you know to play it till they come out some

1852
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:04,360
kind of patch you know and it's just like I mean there's been more than one

1853
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:07,520
more than one instance with more than one person saying hey look there's these

1854
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:11,120
kind of problems I'm running on a you know high-end system and yet it's still

1855
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:15,840
running like it's on a 386 computer so it's like what's going on here so

1856
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:19,200
interesting comment from Xenocore in the chat room I want to kind of run this by

1857
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:24,000
you there is no way an all-encompassing quality control can be run on PC games

1858
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,680
there are way too many combinations for hardware you can check all you want and

1859
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:32,880
still find bugs after release I didn't have any issues running Ghostbusters but

1860
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:37,960
it does it done have secure on it however good point is that you know when

1861
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:42,080
on the PlayStation on the Xbox at least you have the same hardware so there is

1862
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:44,880
something to kind of but but you don't know what components are going to go

1863
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:48,280
into those PC games so how can you really audit them I always thought the

1864
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:52,960
games for Windows was kind of one of those types of things was a way to have

1865
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:57,160
the game's quality controlled but I guess he brings up a good point you

1866
02:20:57,160 --> 02:21:01,440
can't really test every hardware combination out there but yeah it's true

1867
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:04,960
that's very true and I just I was kind of weird because like I said I play

1868
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:08,640
Fallout 3 and everyone's perfect I have no problems or anything whatsoever I

1869
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:11,720
played this and it's like the whole thing is getting ready to crash at given

1870
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:18,800
points it's like I just thought was kind of interesting I just well I'm sorry here

1871
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:22,360
the game runs like crap x-link I would still continue to pressure the

1872
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:26,240
developers professionally you know write a letter post on the forums what have

1873
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:29,240
you get you know the other people you know they've been having problems of the

1874
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:32,720
game to continue to helm them and you know say you're not going to support

1875
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:36,520
them in the future if they don't fix their crap most definitely I hear you

1876
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:40,600
I hear on that excellent good luck buddy and take care okay thank you no problem

1877
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:44,600
thank you but bye and Xenocore in chat kind of makes a good point to secure on

1878
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:47,320
games kind of have a reputation for running like crap that's something

1879
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:52,960
important to state as well so I think we are gonna go ahead and wrap up the

1880
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:55,880
skyline for tonight I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through but we do

1881
02:21:55,880 --> 02:21:58,960
want to wrap up and get out of here before it's too late tonight it's

1882
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:02,280
already getting close to nine o'clock midnight on the East Coast do you have

1883
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:05,000
any other quick stories one to get out there Loki yeah that's a quick stuff

1884
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:11,600
real quick there is a website apparently it's a book project that this guy's

1885
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:17,840
doing called there will be brawl and it's the artist names Greg death Greg

1886
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:23,680
DeStefano and you can look at the pictures that they have there on www.

1887
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:31,520
Greg DeStefano.com that's g-r-e-g-d-e-s-t-e-f-a-n-o.com and they've got some

1888
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:37,720
pretty interesting pictures sadly enough that Icarus guy looks like Shane that's

1889
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:46,440
kind of funny and wait let me see let me see it's sort of he maybe if Shane took

1890
02:22:46,440 --> 02:22:55,080
hardcore drugs how about a Wario's John Goodman yeah sort of okay that I see a

1891
02:22:55,080 --> 02:23:00,960
little more yes okay there you go but yeah it's interesting and then other

1892
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:08,560
things there's some cool rumors going on including that there's gonna be some

1893
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:12,720
little big planet download content coming soon themed after the Ghostbusters

1894
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:16,280
actually this is probably less of a rumor because it's actually on media

1895
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:21,480
molecules website and they have just in white text on black background who you

1896
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:26,280
gonna call and of course that's from Ghostbusters so makes perfect sense that

1897
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:30,200
will probably seen some stuff pretty soon from that probably just costumes

1898
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:35,600
though the Hanabi festival is coming back in Europe and there's actually a

1899
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:42,320
pretty good lineup of games coming with that including I saw they had an ogre

1900
02:23:42,320 --> 02:23:48,080
battle which is pretty cool ogre battle from the Super Nintendo pulse man from

1901
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:55,880
the Sega Mega Drive bomber man 94 on turbo graphics 16 detonate twin be on

1902
02:23:55,880 --> 02:24:01,160
also the turbo graphics Kirby's dreamland 3 on Super Nintendo

1903
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:08,940
Musha on Sega Mega Drive smash table tennis on the NES and zodas revenge

1904
02:24:08,940 --> 02:24:15,240
star tropics to all these coming to virtual console during the month of July

1905
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:20,000
and yes that's kind of neat yeah so that's pretty awesome Star Trek Star

1906
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:24,360
Trek star tropics to never come out over there no I guess not interesting over

1907
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:30,960
here yes there no so that's starting actually as of last Friday so some of

1908
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:35,280
that stuff's already out and dark soccer would be all over that to Tana Twimby

1909
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:39,040
coming out I know she was a fan of that yes so that's pretty cool

1910
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:47,160
um Konami a guest is also confirmed that they're gonna be porting over contra

1911
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:54,120
rebirth for Europe in August and also drift mania with two eyes also coming to

1912
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:59,840
we wear as well so you drift drift mania I guess that's how you pronounce that

1913
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:06,480
top-down racing game and you know those are coming to Europe so that means that

1914
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:10,120
they're localizing it for English so hopefully we'll see those over here as

1915
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:17,240
well this is kind of a neat rumor apparently TMNT smash-up is going to be

1916
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:20,760
getting some other characters that aren't necessarily in the Ninja Turtles

1917
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:25,200
universe apparently they're also going to be getting two rabid characters one

1918
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:30,240
of them is rumored to be dressed up as Sam Fisher from of course the splinter

1919
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:35,400
cell series and then also rabid dressed up as a cheerleader and those are

1920
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:39,180
supposed to be in you know the all-term Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighting

1921
02:25:39,180 --> 02:25:43,360
game which is kind of interesting that's some more characters they're shown for

1922
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:46,600
that and it's actually some stuff from the comic that I'm not even familiar

1923
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:50,040
with and then lastly I just have to mention this because I remember this

1924
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:54,680
when I had a graphing calculator in high school that they were trying to port

1925
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:59,000
this to the TI-83 but finally Link's Awakening has been ported to the TI-83

1926
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:04,360
oh my god and it's been that long that I've been waiting you know I remember

1927
02:26:04,360 --> 02:26:07,160
this coming out and it's like oh my god Link's Awakening we can play it on the

1928
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:12,840
TI-83 but really like those little graphing calculators can handle the

1929
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:17,360
processing they can have you show me the video they can hack them so that it's an

1930
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:23,360
assembly and stuff I guess it's awful sound quality but uh you know the you

1931
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:26,560
know graphics are just it's okay the graphics are kind of crap but well I

1932
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:30,320
mean it's a graphic and it's slow but yeah it's a graphing calculator running

1933
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:34,840
the game that's crazy and I think that a lot of the stuff they probably just

1934
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:37,600
programmed from scratch I don't think it's actually being emulated yeah I

1935
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:40,920
can't imagine this is any fun to actually play this is just more of an

1936
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:44,720
accomplishment than anything else but yeah I mean I remember you know back in

1937
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:50,200
the day it used to be you know this is back when they first started porting a

1938
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:56,640
like assembly stuff to the TI-85 and you can hack the calculator to run faster

1939
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:01,400
than it normally could and you could do grayscale games and stuff like that the

1940
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:05,760
days this is why I quit my calculus class because I was too busy programming

1941
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:15,480
games nice but uh yeah and that's all I have right now all right wow we're made

1942
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:18,280
it we're to the end of the show I know it's a little earlier than last week but

1943
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:21,280
we're kind of at the end of the show and that's okay cuz I don't know about you

1944
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:23,640
guys but after this holiday weekend I still have some things I'm trying to

1945
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:27,480
take care of before I go back to work tomorrow after this whole three-day work

1946
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:32,440
weekend so yeah we're gonna go ahead and wrap things up and get on out of here

1947
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:36,400
for the night but thank you guys so much for listening tonight and sadly dark

1948
02:27:36,400 --> 02:27:39,760
soccer is not here either and you know she'll usually help banter with us for a

1949
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:41,960
little while and bring her stories to table she's not here so I think it's

1950
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:45,200
gonna be the end of the show believe it or not we're done we're out of here

1951
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:48,800
which is also actually it's good because it gives me a chance to make sure I can

1952
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:53,560
get on the network and get those other get the files that I need to upload the

1953
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:56,320
show later this week because I don't want the podcast people have to wait any

1954
02:27:56,320 --> 02:28:01,160
longer so we're out of here believe it or not that's it have a great night

1955
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:04,920
everybody let's go around everybody's final thoughts Loki your final thought

1956
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:10,000
my final thought is I'm watching and someone actually took a DS light and

1957
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:16,040
they've managed to turn it into an arcade cabinet or I should say put a DS

1958
02:28:16,040 --> 02:28:21,600
in an arcade cabinet that's crazy Wow my final thought is instead of spending

1959
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:25,000
$400 on a laptop I should have just bought myself an arcade cabinet for my

1960
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:30,920
house I would have been fun the real love that you know in hindsight like I

1961
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:35,800
said I think before I rather bought see because we're in an apartment complex in

1962
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:38,760
order to have the whole thing delivered it comes on a pallet and I mean you

1963
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:42,680
can't deliver a pallet of stuff to an apartment complex you're gonna get

1964
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:47,080
people looking at you funny and but man that would have been the way I've gone

1965
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:52,520
it costs like a sixth of what I paid for it and just you know looks so much nicer

1966
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:57,240
