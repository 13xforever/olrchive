1
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:15,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, July 5th, 2009.

2
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,984
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to some games that disappeared from Xbox Live?

3
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:22,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Details emerge on Last.fm connectivity with the Xbox.

4
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Could PS2 emulation be coming back to the PlayStation 3?

5
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:32,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everybody.

6
00:00:54,963 --> 00:00:56,843
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, the happiest bunny on the farm

7
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:21,773
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm sure they're having fun being big giggling girls and no, I always tease them about that but I know they're having a good time nerding it up, I'm sure.

8
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,796
[SPEAKER_05]: If there was a Star Trek experience, I'm sure they'd be there right now but sadly it's closed.

9
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they reopened it.

10
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:31,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're going to reopen it soon but it's not open yet.

11
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, you know, the worst time to close it right before the movie comes out and it's like, ah, missed potential.

12
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Bummer, whoops.

13
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:41,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we still have you guys in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

14
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:44,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if DarkSakura might be listening.

15
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:46,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I think her and Tiara are just kind of hanging out tonight.

16
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:47,086
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just kind of away.

17
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:50,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So if so, I expect angry text messages.

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,908
[SPEAKER_03]: They shouldn't be listening.

19
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,209
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be gambling and seeing shows.

20
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,510
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:16,677
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:40,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't buy fireworks because in California the fireworks all suck here.

23
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,263
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting more safe and sane as the time goes on.

24
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:49,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So you buy $100 worth of fireworks and they last you like five minutes because...

25
00:02:50,958 --> 00:03:12,007
[SPEAKER_03]: and so being smart and just plain lazy and broke this year decided, you know, I'm just not going to buy fireworks so we decided to go down to our local mall that was doing a fireworks show and so we went and kind of sat on my sister's apartment lawn and watched them from there.

26
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:14,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was alright, you know, it's like, whatever.

27
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:19,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is funny, because Loki and I were at the same show last night, except I was in the actual mall parking lot.

28
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:21,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is funny.

29
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,799
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the unplanned, we were at the same place.

30
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so... Took us an hour to get out of that goddamn lot.

31
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Three minutes, for us.

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,080
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck.

33
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:30,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we were far enough away.

34
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so... Yeah, that's what we basically did, and it was okay, I mean, it's just...

35
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:38,622
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:04,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually this year, the night before, because they do the rodeo for three days or so.

37
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:06,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do the Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

38
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:09,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe this year is Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

39
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:13,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so they had fireworks each night.

40
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:17,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately the second night, apparently there was an accident.

41
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:22,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the mortars shot off into the crowd, burning people.

42
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So, sad I missed that.

43
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So, oh well.

44
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:27,741
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

45
00:04:29,383 --> 00:04:34,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it isn't like Final Destination where you had a premonition to not go.

46
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:45,611
[SPEAKER_03]: No, by premonition meaning that the rodeo sucked every year, then yeah, I guess... Well, we normally don't actually go into the rodeo, we just watch it from outside, but...

47
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:52,271
[SPEAKER_03]: They started figuring out that people are doing that, so they keep shooting the fireworks even lower.

48
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:59,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's dangerous enough, but because they go, Hey, you've got to come in the rodeo to see the fireworks.

49
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:01,423
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to shoot them 10 feet above everybody.

50
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:02,584
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, come on.

51
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:04,647
[SPEAKER_03]: But, oh well.

52
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:26,089
[SPEAKER_05]: reading our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com looking at some of the commentary, Tiger Claw suggesting we need someone to make OLR fireworks fireworks that explode into the OLR logo hey, I'd be down for that, except they're probably very expensive I love it, DarkTentCia says why can't they play America, fuck yeah, during a show I said the exact same thing so did I I said the exact same thing last night were you listening to the whole simulcast they did on One Direction?

53
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:32,971
[SPEAKER_05]: yes, that was crap and they're playing, you know, God bless the USA and all the patriotic stuff I was like, they need to just bust out with America, fuck yeah

54
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:35,623
[SPEAKER_03]: America, fuck yeah, pop pop

55
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:58,408
[SPEAKER_05]: and just the biggest fire you could possibly imagine.

56
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:05,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since I like fire a lot, not only did I see the fireworks... By the way, a happy 4th of July to all the other American folks that listen to our program.

57
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:08,552
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not American, well, I hope you had a good weekend, nonetheless.

58
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:14,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Canada Day to those of our friends in Canada, because that was just this past week as well, three days before ours.

59
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:15,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and you know what?

60
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:18,536
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really... I mean, a lot of people, I guess, celebrate independence.

61
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I just celebrate the fact they get the light stuff on fire.

62
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:21,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

63
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:22,858
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I really celebrate.

64
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:26,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's something that the whole world can celebrate.

65
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:30,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, some of those safe and sane fireworks, though, are a little crazy, okay?

66
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:32,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, like, okay, we really like fire.

67
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:36,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So not only did we go to the public fireworks show, but then we came back and lit off some of our private stash.

68
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:38,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know Victoria.

69
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:42,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Victoria was there, and she had brought her 11-year-old brother, like stepbrother or something, came...

70
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:43,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

71
00:06:58,942 --> 00:06:59,923
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

72
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,967
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Super Scope 6 of fireworks.

73
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:24,629
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to literally put it on your shoulder.

74
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:28,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was going to be a pathetic little display like a sparkler or something.

75
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:31,933
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this thing was a... It didn't last very long.

76
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,314
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only about 30 seconds.

77
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:40,438
[SPEAKER_05]: But it shot off monsters of color and sparks so much that the kid got afraid and started backing up a little bit.

78
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:43,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were all actually kind of like, this can't be good.

79
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,161
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was scared to hold it and all this stuff.

80
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:46,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And Victoria was just like...

81
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,723
[SPEAKER_04]: You fucking bought it!

82
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:52,165
[SPEAKER_04]: You fucking hold it!

83
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:53,586
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

84
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:55,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, teaching them young.

85
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:57,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, and it was cool.

86
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:01,571
[SPEAKER_05]: We set it off, and it was very amusing, at least for those 30 seconds.

87
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:10,136
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing we did during Fourth of July is we were watching Comedy Central all day, where they had a marathon of, like, stand-up comedy, which is awesome.

88
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,277
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a bunch of comedians in there.

89
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, yeah, that's that guy that I wanted to see.

90
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:16,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was pretty much it.

91
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:16,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

92
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:21,663
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any, unfortunately at Tiger Cloud we don't have cool things like roaming candles here.

93
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:23,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's asking if I'm talking about roaming candles.

94
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:25,604
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't point, this wasn't something you point upwards.

95
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:29,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You hold it like a bazooka or a Super Scope 6 and it shoots sideways.

96
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:34,306
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's shooting out looks like the type of thing you would see in a normal safe and sane firework.

97
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:40,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to describe this for people not in California, but like, you know, just the little sparks that go...

98
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:41,649
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

99
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:09,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen my friend's dad is a firefighter, or fire chief actually, and he confiscates all the fireworks.

100
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:11,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Confiscates, quote unquote.

101
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:14,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Stashes them for his own fireworks display.

102
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my brother was a firefighter.

103
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I know all about confiscating.

104
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,322
[SPEAKER_03]: They had little boxes that are mortars and stuff.

105
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:21,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stuff that...

106
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:23,803
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

107
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:38,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

108
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:56,888
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think so.

109
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:57,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

110
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:58,129
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have any this year.

111
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:58,629
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're around.

112
00:09:58,869 --> 00:09:59,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they?

113
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:00,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

114
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:09,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have those, and their thing was as a big group or a party and stuff, they tried to light off more and more each year.

115
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:10,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the year we went, they were doing like 250.

116
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's been getting more and more.

117
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:15,702
[SPEAKER_03]: This was many years ago.

118
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:19,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen.

119
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:22,087
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally was a pile that they meticulously, you know,

120
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:23,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

121
00:10:37,642 --> 00:10:38,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It's breathtaking.

122
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:39,523
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't stop.

123
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,685
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to bust out laughing because it's the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen.

124
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:44,546
[SPEAKER_03]: You just wanted to cry.

125
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:45,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so amazing.

126
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:46,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crazy.

127
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:48,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we had video of it.

128
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:56,032
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like you'll spend all day setting up dominoes for just that one minute thrill when you knock them all over.

129
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:56,452
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically it.

130
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:57,973
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what it sounds like to me.

131
00:10:58,053 --> 00:10:59,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Setting up 400 ground flowers.

132
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:04,917
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotten so big now that they literally have four or five piles of this stuff.

133
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:11,831
[SPEAKER_03]: and it, like, by the time it's done, it's just like, there's like a block radius of just this ground flower just left.

134
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:15,433
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole ground flower bomb went off.

135
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:16,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

136
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:17,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

137
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:18,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

138
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:19,955
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.

139
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:21,176
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a lot of fun.

140
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:29,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, hey, we've talked a lot about fire and fireworks, and I'm sure the kids love that, but let's talk about video games a little bit with How Was Your Gaming Week.

141
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, How Was Your Gaming Week?

142
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:32,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play much.

143
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:40,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I played, of course, the usual hacked Grand Theft Auto 4, and yes, I have people requesting that I play with them and stuff online.

144
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:48,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't play with you guys online because our systems are modded, so we have a special version of it, and it just wouldn't work.

145
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:49,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

146
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:54,845
[SPEAKER_03]: We have items that I've created, and who knows if it'd crash the game if I tried playing with you guys.

147
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:59,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Most likely, you'd be seeing us firing off all these crazy weapons, and you wouldn't be able to do that.

148
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's just the way it works.

149
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, the other thing, our work games, we don't invite other people in.

150
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,052
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the four of us, or three of us, or whoever's playing.

151
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:10,113
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the way it is.

152
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't get that hurt.

153
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:16,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm trying to ignore anybody, I'm just saying that people have been asking me to invite them.

154
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:17,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like...

155
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:19,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do that.

156
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:20,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

157
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so beyond that stuff, it's just getting crazy.

158
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:24,390
[SPEAKER_03]: You just stuck up.

159
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:25,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Just admit it.

160
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:25,753
[SPEAKER_03]: You just stuck up.

161
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not stuck up.

162
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:27,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I play with other people.

163
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:28,879
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

164
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:30,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

165
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:35,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, also, I've been playing, I tried Angry Barry.

166
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got it to work.

167
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I found out that it actually wasn't the game Broken.

168
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:44,416
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually, our internet at work is kind of, it's got a weird firewall on it.

169
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:49,979
[SPEAKER_03]: They have this, what is it, 86-3000 or something like that.

170
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:52,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some weird web filter that they have.

171
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:55,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've only, like, unblocked certain ports or something.

172
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:58,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for whatever reason, like, we can play live.

173
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:22,138
[SPEAKER_03]: but like the community game stuff doesn't work because community games whether you guys know it or not you actually have to be connected to live to use any of the community games even if you bought them and they're on your system you have to connect to live in order for it to work that's kind of like what happens with an xbox live arcade game if you're not on your own console that you bought it on but you're under your account it'll kind of check live first exactly sounds like that

174
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:28,383
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, these are the consoles I bought, or it's the games I bought on this console, so it's kind of annoying.

175
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:33,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I didn't realize this, but at work I was getting this weird error message.

176
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:37,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's weird, too, because other community games I've gotten have worked just fine.

177
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:44,097
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe I wasn't, like, maybe they changed something or whatever, because I played Carnivale, and that was kind of fun.

178
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:49,161
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, so Angry Barry, for whatever reason, didn't work at work.

179
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:50,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

180
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:16,800
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got all sorts of crazy enemies and stuff, and all sorts of political references.

181
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:18,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's great.

182
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:19,623
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely worth checking out.

183
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:23,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's only like 400 Microsoft points, so I think it's worth that.

184
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:26,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see a game like this, but with Sarah Palin.

185
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:31,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be very funny, especially now that she's not going to be the governor of Alaska anymore, if you've been watching the news at all this week.

186
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:36,198
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is she going to do in her spare time but save the world from crime?

187
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:37,815
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

188
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:53,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

189
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:19,960
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game is fun, and now that I've figured out how to cheat and teleport to different spots on the map to get different vista points and stuff, it makes it nice and easy.

190
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:29,065
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was funny, though, because the first section of the game, the first little region that you're in, I didn't realize that I've only done one page of the challenges.

191
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:29,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what the hell?

192
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does this challenge say I'm not done?

193
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I've done all six of them.

194
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:35,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, there's a page over.

195
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:35,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops!

196
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,112
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, that happens with races too.

197
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:46,037
[SPEAKER_05]: In the second area, in Tsunami Zone or whatever it's called, there's six races, not three.

198
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:47,779
[SPEAKER_05]: So just watch out for that.

199
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

200
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:51,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't they put more on my page?

201
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you get fooled?

202
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:53,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why they did it that way.

203
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:56,552
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's important in the Tsunami Reef or whatever.

204
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:57,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's what's called Tsunami Reef.

205
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:07,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Because those races not only will unlock, you get your Challenge Doppler, the Livery Doppler, but you also get three cars that are new cars.

206
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you run into them, you unlock a vehicle.

207
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's important to play all those races if you want to get all the vehicles.

208
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:13,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do.

209
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:16,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm actually tired of driving as the one side.

210
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:18,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I did all those unlock codes for different vehicles.

211
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:19,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

212
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,201
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of eh, but I like the clothing, so I kept the clothing.

213
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:25,103
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's still fun.

214
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:29,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, I really wish I had more time to play it because I would be playing it a lot more.

215
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,070
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been busy with that and other things.

216
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:37,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and still haven't got a chance to play Wii Sports Resort.

217
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:43,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get to this question from J-Rod in chat because you were talking about Angry Barry and it kind of brought up community games.

218
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:46,245
[SPEAKER_05]: J-Rod wants to know, are those community games free to download?

219
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:52,433
[SPEAKER_03]: They're free to demo, yes, but they do cost money if you want to actually buy the registered version.

220
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:54,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like Xbox Live Arcade.

221
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:56,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Except the community games tend to be a lot cheaper.

222
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:59,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, the lowest price on the community games, 200 Microsoft points.

223
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And another thing too, I haven't really gotten a chance to play around with it yet.

224
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:08,365
[SPEAKER_03]: The new kind of game making program, Kodu, is actually out now.

225
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:10,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And 400 Microsoft points.

226
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:14,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Five bucks for a game that you can make games in and send them to your friends and share stuff like that.

227
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent deal.

228
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely check that out.

229
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:20,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

230
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:22,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else for your gaming week?

231
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:45,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

232
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:08,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

233
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:09,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

234
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to go play something else like that.

235
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,191
[SPEAKER_05]: But keep in mind also I have a roommate so I can't have the TV whenever I want.

236
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:15,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

237
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:19,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep in mind that's a big reason why I don't always play Xbox games and stuff.

238
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,514
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to get a VGA cable.

239
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,262
[SPEAKER_05]: For my monitor?

240
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

241
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:23,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I do.

242
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that is something I need to invest in.

243
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:26,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I play on my computer all the time.

244
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:27,604
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I really play on my 360 on.

245
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:28,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's something else.

246
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:29,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get teased too much.

247
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:36,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play all those Facebook games all week, although I did play some more legitimate things like Bejeweled and Text Twist, and they have Uno on Facebook now.

248
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:47,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're aware, but they have Uno on Facebook that is similar to the Xbox Live one, except instead of seeing webcams, you're seeing people's little Facebook icons, and you're in a little chat room, so you can actually play Uno.

249
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:50,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I was checking a lot of that out this week.

250
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:54,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also got a new laptop this week.

251
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:58,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Fry's is having a really good deal on laptops this weekend because it's 4th of July and all that stuff.

252
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:00,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually went and got a new laptop.

253
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:02,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Toshiba, so it's not a bad brand.

254
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:08,140
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 gigahertz machine, 3 gigs of RAM, separate video card inside.

255
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like an onboard video.

256
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a separated video card.

257
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,623
[SPEAKER_05]: 399.99 for this laptop.

258
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:15,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it was a sweet deal.

259
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:20,067
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's also sweet about it, here's where the rest of my gaming week comes into play.

260
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:27,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Because now it's back to a 32-bit operating system, since I don't have so much RAM or what have you, I can play GameTap games again.

261
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:30,816
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually spent some time playing Civilization 4 because I missed it.

262
00:19:31,276 --> 00:19:33,358
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was one of the big games I would play through GameTap.

263
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:39,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know I let out a lot of GameTap hate on a previous show because it would not work with my Windows Vista 64-bit.

264
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,224
[SPEAKER_05]: But now I'm running Windows 7.

265
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:57,846
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah I installed the release candidate that we all got at E3 I decided you know what since I have a new laptop kind of like a fresh start when better time to upgrade my OS so I upgraded to Windows 7 I haven't played enough games on it yet I'm not familiar enough with the operating system yet

266
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:23,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like it seems to be a faster version of Vista but without all the stuff that made Vista so annoying like it's not asking me like 50 times I'm saying there are you sure you want to install this so and so wants to access your computer it's only done that when I've installed stuff otherwise it leaves me alone and it's it's so much easier to turn off the warning messages and stuff so that was one big improvement I noticed right off the bat I do think Windows 7 will be better than Vista that's for sure

267
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:24,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Better than XP?

268
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:25,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

269
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:26,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Still too early to tell.

270
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like though, here's the one huge thing I noticed, if I can talk operating systems for a minute.

271
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:42,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of having all your windows at the bottom, like you know how right now you can see, okay, I have Firefox open, IRC, Adobe Audition, the mixer, and all this stuff that you see there.

272
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:51,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, instead of it that, imagine that what would happen is that you'd see the little icon in the quick launch bar that you had on XP, and it's just like it's a different color.

273
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:53,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the button looks raised because you have windows open.

274
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you hover over the raise button, you see little previews of all the windows.

275
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,641
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another huge change in Windows 7.

276
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:03,743
[SPEAKER_05]: So you save so much real estate on the bottom of the screen with all your windows open at once.

277
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:04,723
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty cool.

278
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:14,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm noticing little things here and there, but being able to play all the old computer games I was missing from not having GameTap work on a newer OS was kind of nice.

279
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:15,971
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

280
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy about that.

281
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:21,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in our chatroom says, Windows 7 release candidate will expire after a year.

282
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:25,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm aware that the two-hour shutdowns begin in March 2010, but look, that's March 2010.

283
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,521
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still a heck of a long ways away, and apparently...

284
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:35,882
[SPEAKER_05]: My laptop comes with some type of free upgrade to Windows 7 anyway because I have like Vista Premium came with it.

285
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:36,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

286
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:38,323
[SPEAKER_05]: They were telling me this at Fry's.

287
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:43,184
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a thing that you can – it's going to either be free or a small fee.

288
00:21:43,464 --> 00:21:45,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't even mind paying a small fee, honestly.

289
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:53,907
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I contact the manufacturer, it's held onto my receipt so I can get the 7 free because I'm sure I will prefer 7 to Vista.

290
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:55,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I can already tell I prefer 7 to Vista.

291
00:21:56,027 --> 00:22:00,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel weird if I bought an operating system, so I'm going to hold out for the pirated version.

292
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:05,875
[SPEAKER_05]: But if your laptop comes with it for free, I mean, you know, so I'm entitled to it, right?

293
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:07,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a piracy thing.

294
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,477
[SPEAKER_05]: It came with my laptop.

295
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:09,838
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm talking about my computer.

296
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:10,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's you.

297
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

298
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:14,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that I don't want to pay for it.

299
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:16,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just I don't want to pay for it.

300
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:18,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Ranma in chat says, don't worry, you get a free upgrade.

301
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:26,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see, TigerClaw says, the deals you see about home being $49 and professional being $99 is for those that bought PCs with a Vista.

302
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:32,760
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting because that means that that means it's kind of like an apology for Windows Vista.

303
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:38,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in chat goes on, as of last Friday, when you buy any computer, you get a low cost or free upgrade for $7.

304
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:40,046
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

305
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked a great time to upgrade, didn't I?

306
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo!

307
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:43,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

308
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:45,958
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

309
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:14,216
[SPEAKER_05]: and only $150 more than the cost of a PSP Go.

310
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:16,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I was listening to an old episode of ORLR.

311
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,619
[SPEAKER_05]: When I say old, I mean just a couple weeks old.

312
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,224
[SPEAKER_05]: We were kind of in that debate about the PSP Go and how Sony is absolutely being idiotic with their price points.

313
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:27,266
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what's killing this generation.

314
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:28,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, $249 can buy you a freaking laptop.

315
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:37,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talk about how PSPs are cool because they can do music and games and all the things that a laptop can do.

316
00:23:38,054 --> 00:23:38,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what, Sony?

317
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:43,645
[SPEAKER_05]: A laptop costs as much as you're charging for your PSP Go.

318
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:47,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever, that was, oh, it's so frustrating.

319
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:54,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not that they're bad systems, it's just that Sony's getting... It's just like when, remember the PlayStation 3?

320
00:23:54,434 --> 00:24:00,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was like, you know, they're showing the system and everything, and it was like, yeah, this looks awesome, this is gonna be sweet, you know?

321
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,582
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're like, oh, and it's gonna be... $5.99.

322
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,743
[SPEAKER_03]: $5.99, and you're like...

323
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:09,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Duh, you stupid!

324
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:25,453
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

325
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:53,930
[SPEAKER_05]: My Significant Other has a PlayStation 2.

326
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't play any video games on it.

327
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,392
[SPEAKER_05]: It uses it as a DVD player.

328
00:24:57,672 --> 00:25:07,338
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of people out there like that that will buy it as a player, but kind of knowing that, oh, well, if I wanted to play games on it or had somebody to entertain, I could.

329
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:18,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good, but see, that's the thing, though, is that's good to increase your install base, but when you look at something like that, then think about all the people that did buy it for mainly a Blu-ray player

330
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:23,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Their numbers already for being in third place aren't that great.

331
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:33,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you take off X amount of percentage of that, saying that these people are only going to be using it for mainly a Blu-ray player, that's really not good.

332
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:43,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were kind of hoping that they would get a little bit of a bump from people buying it as a cheap Blu-ray player, but it's not working out for them anymore.

333
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:52,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa Congusto in chat makes an interesting comment, chat.orangelandredo.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening as we tape at allgames.com.

334
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:56,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa says, I was talking about the economy with new game prices the other day with a friend.

335
00:25:57,167 --> 00:26:07,372
[SPEAKER_05]: The prices have gone down over the years, recollecting that if a new game was $60 in 1993 for me, but I still wonder if the new titles can command the same opening price with the unemployment rate skyrocketing.

336
00:26:07,972 --> 00:26:10,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and somebody followed up in chat, well, Sony sure hopes so.

337
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:17,098
[SPEAKER_05]: To some extent, they do say that even in a recession, people will not neglect their entertainment.

338
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:17,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at movies.

339
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:25,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Transformers did extraordinarily well at the box office, even with the fact that tickets cost like $10.25 a pop now.

340
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, movies are freaking expensive.

341
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,828
[SPEAKER_05]: But Transformers had, what, the second best weekend only to The Dark Knight?

342
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:32,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's still huge business.

343
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:34,590
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's a lot of freaking money.

344
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,771
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are going to see a movie.

345
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:36,352
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

346
00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:52,808
[SPEAKER_03]: They can still afford to go to the movies.

347
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:53,689
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know what?

348
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:54,749
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be smarter about it.

349
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:58,890
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to go see a movie, don't buy the popcorn and soda there.

350
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Go see a matinee.

351
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,470
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

352
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,910
[SPEAKER_03]: You save yourself a ton of money.

353
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,471
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that the concession prices are so expensive and the movie prices are pretty expensive.

354
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:08,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Or go to the drive-in.

355
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:09,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.

356
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:14,433
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how much you can save at the drive-in with the double features and bringing in your own crap in the backseat and everything?

357
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

358
00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:20,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised the drive-ins do not thrive in an economy like this one.

359
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:26,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you notice, remember they were talking about closing the drive-in that we have in Sacramento here for a while now.

360
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:26,746
[SPEAKER_05]: They always do.

361
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:27,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year they're talking about closing it.

362
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:30,069
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking about, let's put in a 25-screen theater.

363
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:30,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

364
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:33,504
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

365
00:27:57,523 --> 00:27:58,644
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

366
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:22,539
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

367
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,491
[SPEAKER_05]: What does Sony have to justify that PSP go with?

368
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:45,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot.

369
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:46,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry, fanboys.

370
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:47,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you got your games.

371
00:28:48,332 --> 00:28:50,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you got your multi stuff that you can do in there.

372
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:51,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

373
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:52,894
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not justify the price.

374
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:56,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, they did say, and then, you know, I know this doesn't justify anything.

375
00:28:56,135 --> 00:29:00,256
[SPEAKER_03]: They did say that the processor is going to be four times, you know, it's going to be a little bit faster.

376
00:29:00,276 --> 00:29:01,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

377
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:05,380
[SPEAKER_05]: The average gamer does not give two shits.

378
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say they're not going to sell any of those things.

379
00:29:08,242 --> 00:29:13,227
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty of Sony fanboys that'll be forking over the money, but it's going to be an embarrassment.

380
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,589
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have to cut the price.

381
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:18,972
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be damage control.

382
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:21,835
[SPEAKER_05]: When's this thing supposed to be out?

383
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:22,335
[SPEAKER_05]: August?

384
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:22,635
[SPEAKER_05]: October?

385
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:22,936
[SPEAKER_03]: October.

386
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:29,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then they won't be able to fix it in time for this year's holidays, but next year, you betcha.

387
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,161
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to tank for the holidays.

388
00:29:30,241 --> 00:29:34,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be, well, especially, you know, they've got the PSP 3000 still out there now.

389
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:39,267
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want a PSP, you know, if you think about it, huh, let's see here.

390
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:50,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I can buy this PSP system that's $100 cheaper and, you know, get 16 gigabytes of storage or whatever for that for probably a lot less than $100.

391
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:51,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

392
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:53,076
[SPEAKER_03]: You save money right there.

393
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:57,839
[SPEAKER_05]: AmazeSatsuma in chat asks, Sky, tank worse than the GBA Micro?

394
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that's not a bad comparison because that was a dumb idea too.

395
00:30:03,523 --> 00:30:06,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was one of those things like, oh, how cute, little tiny Game Boy.

396
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,507
[SPEAKER_05]: But in practicalness, come on.

397
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Those GBA Micros were a little silly.

398
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:18,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is actually worse because the reason why is you're basically saying to your retailers, okay, you need to sell these.

399
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:20,955
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

400
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is just going to be an embarrassment.

401
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:51,354
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to set digital distribution for games back a couple years single-handedly.

402
00:30:51,694 --> 00:30:55,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then Sony's going to blame it on that, that people aren't ready for digital distribution.

403
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,477
[SPEAKER_05]: No, blame it on your price.

404
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:00,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that a system without a UMD drive should be cheaper.

405
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they see what happened with the price before with the PlayStation 3.

406
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, come on.

407
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:09,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, did you not learn from that at all?

408
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:36,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to spend this whole show bitching about Sony's price point because we've done it before but it's just frustrating as somebody who wants to see the good in Sony and wants to see a lot of the good stuff they have on the horizon to just watch them literally literally take out a gun point it at their foot and pull the trigger to watch them literally do this in front of our eyes is frustrating as a gamer I'm sorry as someone who tries very hard to see the good in Sony yeah

409
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.

410
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a lot for housekeeping tonight.

411
00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:44,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Visit us on Twitter at OLR.

412
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:48,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us emails at Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, etc., etc.

413
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:49,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, go ahead.

414
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:56,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so actually I was going to say, you know, we can talk a little bit about those bundles that they had.

415
00:31:57,191 --> 00:32:07,997
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually two different bundles that are available now for the 8GB system, which is kind of funny because they're like kind of clearing them out, you know, because everybody thinks, oh, they're going to come out with some new 160GB systems or something like that.

416
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:13,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of goes back into what the Ars Technica mole said that the...

417
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,142
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

418
00:32:42,692 --> 00:32:51,997
[SPEAKER_03]: and according to UDN.com, half the orders have gone to Taiwanese group Foxconn and the other half have gone to Pegatron.

419
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:57,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it a Taiwanese lawyer that tried to cease and desist the early images of the PS3 Slimbox 2?

420
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:57,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was.

421
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:27,723
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently these were the manufacturers that have I think manufactured the original PS3 so it makes sense and they also said that the timing makes sense the rumor that it's going to be released in August because in Japan they actually have more console sales during the summer as opposed to the holiday season for us in the United States and Canada

422
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:36,287
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it makes sense maybe that they're trying to sell off all these PS3 80 gig systems to kind of clean out their inventory.

423
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:43,791
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing these kind of bundles to, you know, push out some more systems to kind of make space for this new system.

424
00:33:43,831 --> 00:33:50,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, who knows, maybe going into our next story, you know, with the whole emulation thing.

425
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:53,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us a little more about the emulation thing then.

426
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:56,200
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to open that can of worms, let's talk about it.

427
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:56,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

428
00:33:56,981 --> 00:34:02,307
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about it, why would I need a PS3 Slim system when I have a PS3?

429
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:07,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's rumors now that they may be bringing back the emulation.

430
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:12,317
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming from the fact that there has been a new patent issued

431
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:19,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess back in December, talking about full emulation of the Emotion Engine.

432
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:23,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Emotion Engine was the chipset that they had in the PlayStation 2.

433
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:30,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically what you had in the launch PS3 systems that allowed you to play the PlayStation 2 games.

434
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:42,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, they took out one of those two chips for the 80-gig system that was with Metal Gear Solid 4, and they were doing some of that with software emulation, and then later on they took out all of the chips.

435
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:54,864
[SPEAKER_03]: and so now you have no emulation but like they did with the Playstation 1 the Playstation 1 is completely software emulated and you can play your discs and you can download Playstation 1 games

436
00:34:56,249 --> 00:35:00,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So you better believe it that they're probably going to have PlayStation 2 game downloads.

437
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my thing, though.

438
00:35:01,771 --> 00:35:14,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they really going to patch this in and allow everybody to play their PlayStation 2 games, or are they just going to really strictly leave this as software emulation for the titles that are downloaded so that you have to buy your games again?

439
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:16,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they want to piss me off or not?

440
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:19,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Is basically the question that's out on the table.

441
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:30,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope if the emulation is being built in there to play these old games and put them out there on the service, which makes a lot of sense as to why now, why this is happening, especially with digital distribution being so big.

442
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:35,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the PSP Go will leave because if this thing has a faster processor, right?

443
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:35,909
[SPEAKER_05]: You said the processor.

444
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:39,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe these PSP Go's are going to be armed to play the PlayStation 2 games.

445
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:43,714
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to work because the patent's actually for the cell processor to interpret.

446
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:46,235
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

447
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:16,207
[SPEAKER_05]: but just not PlayStation 2 which is noticeably missing from the newer models anyway which I think most people have.

448
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:18,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a model that can play the old stuff.

449
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,290
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.

450
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,612
[SPEAKER_03]: How greedy are they?

451
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:26,676
[SPEAKER_03]: The real question that we need to be asking them because they want the PlayStation 2 to still sell well.

452
00:36:26,857 --> 00:36:31,601
[SPEAKER_03]: They dropped it down to $99 and they still care about that system because it's still selling pretty well.

453
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes outselling the PlayStation 3.

454
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:33,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But

455
00:36:37,256 --> 00:36:48,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to be greedy enough to where when this does come out, if they do happen to release this, are they going to do it as a patch where it will allow you to play any PlayStation 2 game?

456
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:49,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be good.

457
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:56,399
[SPEAKER_03]: That would probably get a lot of people that are pissed off at them off their backs, and it would look really good in a PR standpoint.

458
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:04,121
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they are super greedy, they may also say, hey, we're just going to limit this to the games that you have to download, so you have to rebuy the games.

459
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:07,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Sony has to kill the PlayStation 2 and get the PlayStation 2 owners to move on.

460
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:39,550
[SPEAKER_03]: That also makes sense, because I think a lot of people are clinging to the PlayStation 2 and are upgrading it.

461
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:51,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sure, you put a $99 system next to a $399 system, and the average consumer, again, that's just looking for something to entertain their 9- and 10-year-old is going to go for the $99 system.

462
00:37:51,714 --> 00:37:55,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, a lot of people are upgrading because they're like, well, I have all these PlayStation 2 games.

463
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:57,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to buy a new system and not be able to play them.

464
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I never understood that argument in the first place.

465
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,401
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're buying a new system, you still have your old system.

466
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:04,802
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still play your old games.

467
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:08,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like all of a sudden your old system is just going to vanish.

468
00:38:08,725 --> 00:38:11,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to incinerate itself.

469
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:21,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking as someone who stopped playing PlayStation 2 games when the PlayStation 3 came out, a lot of times it's about space, wires, and just the convenience of it.

470
00:38:21,155 --> 00:38:22,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Convenience is huge.

471
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:26,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me, owning a Wii, an Xbox 360, and a PlayStation 3...

472
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,140
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

473
00:38:50,254 --> 00:38:50,674
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

474
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:17,013
[SPEAKER_05]: As gamers who probably download this podcast, interested in the hardcore stuff, there's a lot of people out there who don't even know how to hook this shit up to their TV.

475
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:19,954
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to call somebody over to explain.

476
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:21,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you've been called before.

477
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:22,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

478
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:33,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Haven't you ever been called to install something like this, like a VCR, a DVD player, a PlayStation, onto somebody's TV, or had to fix it because a wire came out and they didn't know what happened?

479
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,442
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people that don't understand that stuff.

480
00:39:36,764 --> 00:39:47,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing too, though, it's kind of, I mean, presumptuous of them to assume that everybody that has a PlayStation 2 is going to upgrade to a PlayStation 3.

481
00:39:47,894 --> 00:39:57,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people have gotten tired of their shit and have already upgraded to a Wii or, well, it's not really an upgrade, but, you know, have gotten a Wii or have upgraded to like a 360 or something like that.

482
00:39:58,302 --> 00:39:59,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I was one of those people.

483
00:40:00,124 --> 00:40:01,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated the Xbox.

484
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:01,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

485
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:19,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not paying $600 for this.

486
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:23,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, you know, I got it for free, so I didn't have to do that.

487
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:26,302
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if I didn't get it for free, I would not be buying it.

488
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:34,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it's just, it's really, you know, and Microsoft's really changed the way I think about them.

489
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:37,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, with the Xbox, it's just like, oh my god, the system's huge.

490
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:37,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

491
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:40,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Learn from their mistakes.

492
00:40:40,387 --> 00:40:44,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft said, oh, okay, we didn't cater enough to the role-playing game fans.

493
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:46,729
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't cater enough to some of these audiences.

494
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:48,630
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the casual gamer.

495
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,010
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to try and fix those things.

496
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,171
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't happen overnight, but you really see that stuff starting to come together with the 360.

497
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:53,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony...

498
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:55,753
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

499
00:41:10,322 --> 00:41:13,203
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking smoked weed and made the system that came to them in their dream.

500
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they did, but whatever they did worked.

501
00:41:15,304 --> 00:41:19,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Nintendo just, woo, the Wii was kind of in outer space.

502
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when we all first heard of that?

503
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:21,887
[SPEAKER_03]: We were like, the fuck is this?

504
00:41:21,968 --> 00:41:25,409
[SPEAKER_03]: They redesigned the GameCube and made it with some wireless controllers.

505
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:28,170
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically more or less.

506
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:30,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

507
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:37,635
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'll be interested to see what happens, but I have a feeling if there is going to be any sort of software emulation, we're going to see it probably by this fall.

508
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:40,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, J-Rod, interesting comments in the chat here.

509
00:41:41,055 --> 00:41:47,419
[SPEAKER_05]: J-Rod says, I used to be all about my 360, but with Microsoft's piss-poor hardware quality, I've moved on to a PlayStation 3.

510
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:53,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, Microsoft doesn't have piss-poor hardware quality, they jumped the gun to beat Sony.

511
00:41:53,542 --> 00:42:03,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of agree with both of those comments, that yeah, you definitely notice that Microsoft has the higher hardware issue, and honestly, that system as a piece of hardware...

512
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:10,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Loud, obnoxious, not the most attractive thing in my living room.

513
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:14,170
[SPEAKER_05]: But I deal with it because of all the things it provides.

514
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense?

515
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:24,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, for me, the audio and the sound portion of the system as far as how loud it is and stuff doesn't really bother me.

516
00:42:25,057 --> 00:42:29,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a computer that has countless amount of fans on it.

517
00:42:29,499 --> 00:42:31,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super loud and I really don't care.

518
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't even notice it anymore.

519
00:42:32,942 --> 00:42:34,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I just totally tune it out.

520
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:41,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, the PlayStation 3 is immensely quiet compared to the 360.

521
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

522
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:47,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Metal Gear Solid 4 and Killzone 2 with it

523
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:19,312
[SPEAKER_05]: All for $400, so that's not too bad considering you're getting two big games there for $400.

524
00:43:19,772 --> 00:43:28,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, apparently, I guess rumors are saying that there's going to be another bundle that could have LittleBigPlanet, I guess, with it as well.

525
00:43:28,922 --> 00:43:29,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they do have it.

526
00:43:29,763 --> 00:43:33,528
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one, I think, they do have it with LittleBigPlanet and WALL-E.

527
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:34,548
[SPEAKER_05]: The Blu-ray.

528
00:43:34,808 --> 00:43:35,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

529
00:43:35,789 --> 00:43:38,971
[SPEAKER_05]: That's especially interesting considering WALL-E isn't a Sony movie.

530
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:39,951
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Disney movie.

531
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:42,392
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little weird to me.

532
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:44,153
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think they would throw in a Sony movie.

533
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Kung Fu Panda or something.

534
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,735
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not Sony.

535
00:43:48,015 --> 00:43:49,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand the need.

536
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, they're going for the family system.

537
00:43:51,477 --> 00:43:53,658
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's very interesting that it's a Disney movie.

538
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:56,479
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds more like something Costco would do.

539
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,780
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how Costco bundles all this stuff together.

540
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:00,341
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't need the manufacturer to do it.

541
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:01,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

542
00:44:01,862 --> 00:44:02,803
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, those are some...

543
00:44:03,903 --> 00:44:04,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

544
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:15,023
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

545
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: A Wii bundled with rubber duckies, or a Wii bundled with pirate tattoo arm sleeves.

546
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:46,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

547
00:44:46,953 --> 00:44:51,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but... These are crappy little carnival gifts they're just throwing in with the Wii.

548
00:44:52,238 --> 00:44:54,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that really going to motivate someone to go get a Nintendo Wii?

549
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:56,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I want to get the rubber ducky!

550
00:44:57,503 --> 00:45:02,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely crap, because if you think about it, I mean, these are like dollar store toys, I mean...

551
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would, it's like, oh, you know, I gotta get a free water gun.

552
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:11,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a cheap-ass water gun.

553
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:28,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's the kind of thing now with, like, GameStop, and, you know, in a lot of these places, you know, a lot of people are, like, my customers I deal with, you know, bitching about GameStop having the exclusives for, you know, different content and stuff, unlockables, you know, exclusive things.

554
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:33,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, in the Conduit, they had, you know, the all-seeing eye was blue in the game.

555
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:54,931
[SPEAKER_03]: that's it it just happened to be blue who cares you know it's like big whoop and this is kind of more like that it's like okay where the hell did you get these free water pistols for and why would you you know even think about bundling them with the Wii I mean why even bother it's just crap but

556
00:45:55,723 --> 00:45:57,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

557
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:00,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they're trying to give some added value to this, but I'm not so sure.

558
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:01,967
[SPEAKER_03]: That's no value at all.

559
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:05,270
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, take a dump and put it in a bag and throw it in there.

560
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:06,611
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be worth more than that stuff.

561
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:08,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's just...

562
00:46:09,764 --> 00:46:10,545
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell are they thinking?

563
00:46:10,745 --> 00:46:20,853
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing it did successfully do for them is getting people to talk about it on blogs and on this show because it's so asinine, but that's not a positive.

564
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:25,517
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to make anybody go, hey, I want to go purchase that GameStop because they get crap with it.

565
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:29,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm going to go back to the Costco example.

566
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Costco will bundle in useful things with these systems, like a free game or something.

567
00:46:34,383 --> 00:46:35,063
[SPEAKER_05]: But not always free.

568
00:46:35,103 --> 00:46:37,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you're paying a little more money for the extra controller.

569
00:46:37,485 --> 00:46:38,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But you want to go bundles.

570
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:39,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Costco's a good place to go.

571
00:46:39,926 --> 00:46:46,309
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some games out there that are absolute shit that, seriously, they could probably purchase for really, really cheap.

572
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And they could throw that in there.

573
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:50,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would at least be...

574
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:52,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

575
00:47:11,952 --> 00:47:12,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even care.

576
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:15,215
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be like Rubber Ducky Hunter 2009.

577
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:18,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll still do the voice acting because I think that would be awesome.

578
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:37,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, sounds like it could be an interesting bundle, I guess, for crap lovers.

579
00:47:38,576 --> 00:47:42,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice try there, but I think you're going to need to do something else, too.

580
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:43,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh, Shermie wants to get out.

581
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:45,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

582
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:46,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Shermie.

583
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:54,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh, Shermie the cat has been hiding, and I think Shermie wants to get out, but now Shermie's afraid.

584
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:57,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Live on air radio, these things happen.

585
00:47:57,911 --> 00:47:59,532
[SPEAKER_05]: We have cat drama going on.

586
00:48:00,535 --> 00:48:01,517
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

587
00:48:08,908 --> 00:48:10,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have anything else I want to get into right this second.

588
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:11,590
[SPEAKER_05]: You got some more stories?

589
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

590
00:48:12,491 --> 00:48:20,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we're talking about the Wii, you might not even have to buy a Wii because apparently the emulators for the Wii have been doing a pretty good job themselves.

591
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:31,989
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the Dolphin emulator, which also does the GameCube games as well, has now gotten some games playable and also coming out in 720 or 1080p.

592
00:48:33,790 --> 00:49:02,463
[SPEAKER_03]: so they're able to render the games a lot higher so that kind of gives you 16 times anti-aliasing and they also had some other filters that are thrown on top of there but it kind of gives you an impression of what the Wii would look like if they came out with a Wii HD and honestly that kind of has me kind of excited for a Wii HD if they were ever to do that because some of these games don't look bad actually rendered at a higher resolution and granted some of the textures are kind of

593
00:49:03,383 --> 00:49:07,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, low res, but Mad World looks sweet.

594
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:10,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario Galaxy looks pretty awesome.

595
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:15,492
[SPEAKER_03]: They had some other videos I saw of... Punch-Out looked pretty sweet.

596
00:49:16,592 --> 00:49:18,053
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there's a whole bunch of these.

597
00:49:19,474 --> 00:49:22,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, the emulator course is available now, and you can check it out.

598
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:23,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait.

599
00:49:23,857 --> 00:49:27,420
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just put the Wii DVDs in your computer and play these games?

600
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:28,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

601
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:29,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Out there now, yeah.

602
00:49:44,301 --> 00:49:47,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's not worried about this at all?

603
00:49:47,662 --> 00:49:50,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a decent computer to run it.

604
00:49:50,983 --> 00:49:53,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, your laptop would probably be able to run this pretty well.

605
00:49:55,104 --> 00:50:04,547
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the ones that they're showing, I think they're like 4GB processors with 4GB RAM, pretty nice new graphics card and that kind of thing.

606
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:12,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Still though, it leaves the door open because if you can emulate this stuff on a PC, why not?

607
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:14,914
[SPEAKER_03]: What is Shermie doing?

608
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:16,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Shermie's finding other places to hide.

609
00:50:16,816 --> 00:50:17,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

610
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:19,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go outside, kitty.

611
00:50:21,462 --> 00:50:22,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to say hi to the listeners, Shermie?

612
00:50:24,766 --> 00:50:24,986
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

613
00:50:25,346 --> 00:50:25,747
[SPEAKER_03]: No comment.

614
00:50:25,787 --> 00:50:26,488
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a resounding no.

615
00:50:31,104 --> 00:50:32,745
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

616
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:57,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, do some searches online for Wii emulators.

617
00:50:57,213 --> 00:51:02,697
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a guy who does reviews of the emulators and the games and how they play in there and stuff like that.

618
00:51:03,718 --> 00:51:06,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say... Let's see here.

619
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:08,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's...

620
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:21,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainy Barahona is the user on YouTube, R-E-N-E-B-A-R-A-H-O-N-A, and he has a bunch of different videos.

621
00:51:21,207 --> 00:51:25,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually watched the Metroid Prime 3 Corruption one earlier, but he has reviews.

622
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:28,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's the one that's doing the reviews on them.

623
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:33,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get some comments from chat real quick because GameGuru wants to clarify PCs can't read Nintendo optical discs.

624
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was a little crazy there with that comment.

625
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:41,984
[SPEAKER_05]: But also tells me that Nintendo could get 720p with a firmware update to use those four unused connections.

626
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:42,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

627
00:51:43,124 --> 00:51:50,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, keep in mind, these emulators are running off computer hardware and a Wii is running off the hardware of two GameCubes.

628
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:56,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it can't just simply run this with a firmware update or I would have hoped they would have done it a long time ago.

629
00:51:56,992 --> 00:51:57,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

630
00:51:59,144 --> 00:52:00,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know either.

631
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:02,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think Nintendo should be worried about something like this?

632
00:52:02,728 --> 00:52:10,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the fact that their system is being emulated while it is still out there and, some might say, better than the actual system itself?

633
00:52:10,456 --> 00:52:13,959
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be worried if it's actually... Because there are some minor...

634
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

635
00:52:41,943 --> 00:52:42,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess.

636
00:52:43,184 --> 00:52:50,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I would actually like to play a lot more of these things on here and check them out to see what the games look like because Mad World looked really sweet.

637
00:52:50,827 --> 00:52:53,388
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of makes me wish they'd ported to the 360 or something.

638
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And all they're doing is they're just smoothing the textures, basically.

639
00:52:57,751 --> 00:53:00,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's 16 times anti-aliasing.

640
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:05,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like anyone's going back to reprogram these things or anything, or any more work went into them or anything like that.

641
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:06,834
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.

642
00:53:07,014 --> 00:53:22,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason this was actually... I mean, this is... The Dolphin emulator was for the GameCube, and they just modified it to work with the Wii when the Wii came out, because it's basically GameCube hardware and almost the same type of instruction set.

643
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:23,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

644
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:25,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

645
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:36,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just goes to show you that the Wii is really very similar to a GameCube and kind of wish that they would do a Wii HD because at the same time, here's what they could do with their games.

646
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:42,698
[SPEAKER_03]: They could upscale all the games that have come out and they could do some new higher def games or something like that.

647
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:50,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can spend the money and just get an upscaler for your home entertainment system and you can just do the same thing with the Wii.

648
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:52,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

649
00:53:53,673 --> 00:53:59,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently there is a new Final Fantasy game on the way, and it looks like this game is being made for the DS.

650
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:09,916
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually teased around there on the internet, and then Famitsu... Actually, no, I'm sorry, it came from Jump Magazine, I believe is the magazine that finally spilled the details on this.

651
00:54:10,296 --> 00:54:11,876
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Final Fantasy Gaiden.

652
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:15,557
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a new kind of Final Fantasy RPG for the DS.

653
00:54:15,977 --> 00:54:20,378
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks a lot like the Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4 remakes that have happened recently, but...

654
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:21,759
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

655
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:41,318
[SPEAKER_05]: There's apparently, though, now action points.

656
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:50,646
[SPEAKER_05]: When you see your status, you also have yellow dots that go with that, and the actions that you want to do also have dots next to it that indicate how much it's going to cost.

657
00:54:50,966 --> 00:54:54,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds to me like it's not magic points, but like fighting points.

658
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,190
[SPEAKER_05]: A little different there.

659
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:02,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be coming out in the fall in Japan.

660
00:55:02,955 --> 00:55:04,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That would mean probably next year in the U.S.

661
00:55:04,817 --> 00:55:05,918
[SPEAKER_05]: once they get it all translated.

662
00:55:06,258 --> 00:55:06,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds right.

663
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:07,479
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

664
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of fun Final Fantasy stuff.

665
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:11,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I was bringing up here real quick.

666
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:15,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to show you Mad World running on the emulator.

667
00:55:16,325 --> 00:55:17,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You should post this link in chat.

668
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:24,030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a pretty good example of how sharp the game looks.

669
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:27,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Mad World is all black and white and the line art and stuff like that.

670
00:55:27,592 --> 00:55:29,794
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see how it looks a little foggy right there.

671
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:33,396
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the problems with the emulator, at least in this game.

672
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at how sharp everything looks.

673
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

674
00:55:39,523 --> 00:55:40,304
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pretty neat.

675
00:55:40,364 --> 00:55:42,947
[SPEAKER_05]: You should share that in chat if you haven't already.

676
00:55:43,388 --> 00:55:45,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com That does look pretty nice.

677
00:55:47,734 --> 00:55:48,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

678
00:55:48,254 --> 00:55:49,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other stuff we can talk about here.

679
00:55:52,981 --> 00:56:00,964
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably do one more story and then we'll get into the classic game of the week and part B of our show coming up a little later as well as your phone calls.

680
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:01,844
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

681
00:56:01,884 --> 00:56:03,965
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll open up the phones a little later on in the program.

682
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:08,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nintendo might not be too worried about some games at least in this emulator.

683
00:56:09,527 --> 00:56:12,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Sports Resort in Japan just came out, what, last week?

684
00:56:13,148 --> 00:56:16,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And already they've sold over 350,000 copies.

685
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:38,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually selling, it's the third fastest selling Wii title ever, and it's moved 353,827 copies as of June 30th, so by now, who knows, but it's going to be selling, I think, pretty well in, who knows, when it hits the US, I know this thing's been selling like hotcakes already, so...

686
00:56:39,432 --> 00:56:43,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually don't think you'll see the impressive day one numbers that you're seeing over in Japan.

687
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:51,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the US audience, especially those that are huge in the Wii, are that as tuned in to when games are coming out.

688
00:56:52,104 --> 00:56:55,827
[SPEAKER_05]: We're much more tuned in in our culture to when movies are coming out.

689
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:58,029
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably know what movies are opening up this week and next week.

690
00:56:58,049 --> 00:56:59,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think most...

691
00:57:00,307 --> 00:57:04,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Casual gamers and non-hardcore gamers are as tuned in with the release dates.

692
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:09,631
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think you'll see this have the same type of day one sales here, but I think you'll see it grow quickly.

693
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:10,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.

694
00:57:11,132 --> 00:57:17,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of casual gamers obviously probably will be picking this up for Christmas or the holidays.

695
00:57:18,275 --> 00:57:20,436
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a long period of time.

696
00:57:20,756 --> 00:57:22,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And look at Mario Kart Wii.

697
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:24,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It still sells really well.

698
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:52,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Party 8 that stuff sells really well a lot of these games are just evergreen and will sell for the life of the system so I could definitely see this lasting a long time and it probably will end up selling quite a bit and it could also be like Wii Play whereas people bought this they could be buying this for Wii Motion Plus save some money that way and they get a game with it so I could definitely see something like that happening

699
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:59,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just don't think, you know, I think when it comes out here, you're going to see, I bet you that first week, oh, it didn't sell nearly as well in the U.S.

700
00:57:59,513 --> 00:58:00,254
[SPEAKER_05]: as it did in Japan.

701
00:58:00,494 --> 00:58:02,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, it's a failure for Nintendo.

702
00:58:04,015 --> 00:58:04,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it a couple months.

703
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:16,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it a couple months for the hardcore gamers who still love Nintendo to pick it up, and then their friends to see it, and then their friends to see it, and then CNN to do a news story on it, and then Oprah to have it on her show.

704
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:18,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it some time.

705
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:18,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrong, wrong.

706
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:20,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It will not be Oprah having it on her show.

707
00:58:20,725 --> 00:58:23,266
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be Ellen DeGeneres, because she likes it.

708
00:58:23,306 --> 00:58:25,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Ellen has a very high-rated show.

709
00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:27,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hate on Ellen.

710
00:58:27,327 --> 00:58:28,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not hating on Ellen.

711
00:58:28,327 --> 00:58:32,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, Oprah's not... She's more tech-retarded as...

712
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:40,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I should admit that I was watching Oprah, but I was changing the channels and landed on Oprah one day.

713
00:58:40,314 --> 00:58:41,294
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a couple months ago.

714
00:58:41,775 --> 00:58:43,716
[SPEAKER_05]: She had Facebook on her show.

715
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:51,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Oprah, I guess, has this thing where she rips off The View now, where she actually has a panelist of people on some days of the week.

716
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:51,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

717
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:55,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But she had the dude from Facebook there talking about the business.

718
00:58:55,664 --> 00:59:01,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess that was the same day that Oprah was launching her own Facebook account or official Facebook or something.

719
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:01,828
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

720
00:59:19,524 --> 00:59:23,066
[SPEAKER_05]: J-Rod says people scream failure if it doesn't sell a million in its first week.

721
00:59:23,106 --> 00:59:24,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember how LittleBigPlanet was a failure?

722
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:38,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would actually agree with you that LittleBigPlanet, not only is it one of the best games on PlayStation 3 right now, period, if not the best in some circles, but I think that's still a game that sells fairly well.

723
00:59:38,254 --> 00:59:42,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know PlayStation 3 figures that well, but that seems to be a consistent seller too.

724
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's really tapered off.

725
00:59:45,157 --> 00:59:46,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Horrifically or anything.

726
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can really compare Sony sales figures to Nintendo sales figures.

727
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:58,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's horribly underrated and underappreciated and it's going to be one of those games like Katamari was where it's horribly underrated and underappreciated.

728
00:59:59,321 --> 01:00:07,185
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, granted, we all as game fans might appreciate it and understand how awesome it is, but to the casual gamer, they don't understand it.

729
01:00:07,786 --> 01:00:15,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's sad because I think if you put it in the hands of, like, someone that's more of a casual gamer and they actually played it, they would probably think it's really cool.

730
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:19,732
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, there's some people that are just like, oh my god, controllers, oh, I can't do that.

731
01:00:20,192 --> 01:00:24,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, really, the only, you know, stuff in LittleBigPlanet is run, jump, and occasionally grab.

732
01:00:25,134 --> 01:00:29,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you have to understand, these are the same people that can't hook up their damn game systems.

733
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all color-coded!

734
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,202
[SPEAKER_05]: True, true.

735
01:00:31,242 --> 01:00:32,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yellow the yellow!

736
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:33,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's matching!

737
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:35,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Matching colors!

738
01:00:35,788 --> 01:00:37,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you not understand that?

739
01:00:39,983 --> 01:00:40,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess not.

740
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:41,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But some people can't.

741
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:42,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people can't.

742
01:00:42,845 --> 01:00:44,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, should we get into the classic game of the week?

743
01:00:45,186 --> 01:00:45,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we shall.

744
01:00:46,607 --> 01:00:47,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you want to say one more thing real quick?

745
01:00:47,808 --> 01:00:48,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one more thing real quick.

746
01:00:48,488 --> 01:00:48,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sure.

747
01:00:48,748 --> 01:00:49,349
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really quick.

748
01:00:49,389 --> 01:00:49,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Go.

749
01:00:49,489 --> 01:00:53,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Electroplankton's coming to DSiWare in Japan only.

750
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:58,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, it'll be sold for... Oh, that's a rip-off.

751
01:00:58,914 --> 01:01:05,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, it's being... They're breaking up Electroplankton because it was ten different little programs that you can make music with.

752
01:01:06,999 --> 01:01:08,100
[SPEAKER_03]: They're breaking them all up.

753
01:01:09,279 --> 01:01:13,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Individually, the 200 Nintendo points each, so $20 total.

754
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:18,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems kind of a rip-off if you ask me, but I think that's what the game originally sold for.

755
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say, you had to originally buy it.

756
01:01:20,183 --> 01:01:20,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It was weird.

757
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:22,784
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't even market this game big time.

758
01:01:22,824 --> 01:01:24,284
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to buy it through Nintendo's site.

759
01:01:24,304 --> 01:01:25,645
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't even get it in stores, remember?

760
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:31,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and having played Electroplankton, I don't get what the point is.

761
01:01:31,566 --> 01:01:36,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was neat for a second, and then I put it down and it never touches again, so...

762
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:44,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't recommend buying this, but hey, if you're in Japan and you want to waste some points, there you go.

763
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:47,822
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

764
01:02:13,953 --> 01:02:17,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic Game of the Week has been a game that I've wasted countless hours on.

765
01:02:18,676 --> 01:02:23,159
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorite games that's been on every Nintendo system, it would be Mario Kart.

766
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Super Mario Kart.

767
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario Kart, yes.

768
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:27,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful.

769
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:36,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Mario Kart in general, but Super Mario Kart, the one that started it all on the Super Nintendo, came out in 1992.

770
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:38,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that was a long time ago.

771
01:02:39,529 --> 01:02:41,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And did quite well.

772
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:42,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Sold...

773
01:02:44,569 --> 01:02:54,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 8 million copies worldwide and was the, I think, number two title for the Super NES.

774
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:55,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

775
01:02:55,214 --> 01:02:55,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

776
01:02:55,975 --> 01:02:56,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

777
01:02:56,475 --> 01:02:58,316
[SPEAKER_05]: That must be only behind what, Mario World?

778
01:02:58,736 --> 01:02:59,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though that was the pack-in game?

779
01:03:00,797 --> 01:03:01,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

780
01:03:01,598 --> 01:03:01,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

781
01:03:03,178 --> 01:03:03,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see...

782
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:05,920
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the number one game?

783
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:06,740
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.

784
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario World.

785
01:03:08,081 --> 01:03:09,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it was.

786
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:10,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that back.

787
01:03:10,462 --> 01:03:12,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not number two, it was number three.

788
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,563
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, it's close enough.

789
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:17,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Donkey Kong Country also had 8 million sales.

790
01:03:18,105 --> 01:03:22,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to point out, GameGuru in chat says Mario Kart wasn't on the NES or Game Boy.

791
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:24,008
[SPEAKER_05]: True, but they still called it Super Mario Kart.

792
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:25,809
[SPEAKER_05]: The name of this game is Super Mario Kart.

793
01:03:27,296 --> 01:03:38,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario Kart was one of those Mode 7 games, and you'd race around on kind of a flat track, but of course you had little blocks and stuff that made the course and everything.

794
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,301
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a bunch of different theme levels, including...

795
01:03:42,882 --> 01:03:49,550
[SPEAKER_03]: The Booze Mansion, and... Well, they weren't really a mansion, it was kind of like docks, almost, like this dark place.

796
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:57,799
[SPEAKER_03]: But Bowser's Castle, of course, they had the Mushroom Cup, Shell Cup, Flower Cup, Banana Cup, and you had to unlock, you know, each of the...

797
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:02,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get to get gold in those in order to unlock the rest of the cup.

798
01:04:03,162 --> 01:04:10,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, who could forget the special cup that they had in there with Rainbow Road, which is awesome.

799
01:04:10,405 --> 01:04:12,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow Road was sweet.

800
01:04:12,966 --> 01:04:16,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing that I spent the most time on and...

801
01:04:18,632 --> 01:04:19,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Vs. Battle Mode

802
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,922
[SPEAKER_03]: We've wasted so much time doing that, but you'd have different shells.

803
01:04:37,982 --> 01:04:41,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the green shell was kind of dumbfire shell that you'd shoot straight ahead.

804
01:04:42,304 --> 01:04:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the red shell, which was kind of a homing missile almost.

805
01:04:46,385 --> 01:04:50,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Your bananas that you drop behind you to skid out the other player.

806
01:04:51,468 --> 01:04:51,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Also...

807
01:04:52,884 --> 01:04:54,244
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, your mushrooms for boosts.

808
01:04:54,804 --> 01:05:04,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the original game, actually, they had the feather that you could get that you could jump, and that would stand you for jumping walls or jumping the shortcuts and stuff like that.

809
01:05:05,707 --> 01:05:10,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, later on, they had more sequels for the game on practically every Nintendo system.

810
01:05:10,148 --> 01:05:12,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, on every Nintendo system.

811
01:05:13,068 --> 01:05:20,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And they even made its debut in the arcade with two arcade games, Mario Kart Arcade GP and GP2.

812
01:05:22,605 --> 01:05:26,587
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one, of course, I am famous for playing drunk during my bachelor party.

813
01:05:27,287 --> 01:05:30,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Which by far Orange Lounge Radio's most viewed YouTube clip.

814
01:05:30,628 --> 01:05:34,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't remember much of it, but I actually did play it later on.

815
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,671
[SPEAKER_03]: It was alright.

816
01:05:37,311 --> 01:05:38,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same.

817
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:39,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have the same charm.

818
01:05:39,472 --> 01:05:40,553
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't.

819
01:05:40,973 --> 01:05:46,576
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, of course, the original Super Mario Kart game had quite a few characters in there.

820
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:49,738
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they had some unlockable characters as well.

821
01:05:49,778 --> 01:05:55,961
[SPEAKER_03]: But the starting lineup, of course, you had Bowser, Luigi, Mario, Peach, Toad, and Yoshi.

822
01:05:56,902 --> 01:05:59,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could also unlock Donkey Kong Jr.

823
01:05:59,283 --> 01:06:00,164
[SPEAKER_03]: and Koopa Troopa.

824
01:06:01,384 --> 01:06:01,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

825
01:06:03,917 --> 01:06:10,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course the little trick is you can shrink those down as well and play as little miniature characters which we used to do very often.

826
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:14,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And um... Yeah!

827
01:06:14,814 --> 01:06:15,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So um...

828
01:06:17,267 --> 01:06:17,928
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

829
01:06:34,904 --> 01:06:35,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it really?

830
01:06:36,646 --> 01:06:38,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really the first kart racing game?

831
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:39,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

832
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:41,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder where they got the idea for this.

833
01:06:41,991 --> 01:06:44,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if they actually fact-checked that stuff.

834
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,815
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems awfully weird.

835
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:48,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't doubt that it's true.

836
01:06:48,117 --> 01:06:50,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't think of another one that there was.

837
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,801
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just kind of interesting.

838
01:06:51,901 --> 01:06:54,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I wouldn't have thought of that before.

839
01:06:55,985 --> 01:06:56,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

840
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,489
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, lots of fun.

841
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:02,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, of course, Mario Kart Wii came out last year.

842
01:07:02,592 --> 01:07:03,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Still pretty fun.

843
01:07:04,915 --> 01:07:12,383
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it just doesn't have the charm, I think, of the original Mario Kart game, which is available for virtual console download, I believe, if I remember correctly.

844
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:12,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

845
01:07:13,866 --> 01:07:14,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

846
01:07:33,035 --> 01:07:35,036
[SPEAKER_05]: This was my college dorm years, by the way.

847
01:07:35,196 --> 01:07:38,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know the epic battles we had on this game in my college dorm?

848
01:07:39,357 --> 01:07:42,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was probably about 96 or 97 or so.

849
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when the people upstairs got a Nintendo 64 and got Mario Kart 64.

850
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Mario Kart 64 was just nuts.

851
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:56,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not as big of a fan of 64 as I was this one, but it was still really fun to play.

852
01:07:57,004 --> 01:07:59,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I just... This one is kind of one of those, like...

853
01:08:00,245 --> 01:08:01,706
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, sentimental-type games.

854
01:08:01,726 --> 01:08:14,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the love of God, Nintendo, when you put out a new Mario Kart game, and I know how you like doing classic tracks and stuff, is it gonna really kill you to not, you know, include all of, you know, the old battle courses or something like that?

855
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:19,182
[SPEAKER_03]: They always seem to find the ones that, like, nobody played, and let's just, like, bring that one back.

856
01:08:19,282 --> 01:08:19,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

857
01:08:20,023 --> 01:08:21,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario Kart 64

858
01:08:50,853 --> 01:08:51,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

859
01:08:52,334 --> 01:08:52,574
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

860
01:08:52,594 --> 01:08:53,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hopefully soon.

861
01:08:54,736 --> 01:08:55,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's go ahead.

862
01:08:55,316 --> 01:08:56,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

863
01:08:56,757 --> 01:09:02,060
[SPEAKER_05]: When we come back, we've got more news to get into for Part B tonight, and then we're going to take your calls as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

864
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay tuned, guys, because we will be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

865
01:09:13,188 --> 01:09:18,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, July the 5th of 2009.

866
01:09:19,089 --> 01:09:21,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe it or not, we are halfway through the year.

867
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:22,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even believe it.

868
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:28,592
[SPEAKER_05]: We are still, of course, taping live as we always do every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

869
01:09:28,632 --> 01:09:33,293
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are listening live, come join us and chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

870
01:09:33,813 --> 01:09:36,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why we use a separate chat from All Games Radio, but we do.

871
01:09:36,533 --> 01:09:39,054
[SPEAKER_05]: We just always have, because remember Orange Lounge Radio was its own station.

872
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:40,274
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

873
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, Part B, here we go.

874
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get to your mailbag and the FUs of the week and release dates.

875
01:10:10,234 --> 01:10:11,976
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got all sorts of stuff we've still got to cover.

876
01:10:12,477 --> 01:10:15,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure, though, Loki has a few more news stories for us.

877
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:16,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I have tons of new stories.

878
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:20,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's talk about a music game, because that's what's awesome.

879
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:29,975
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Hero announced, of course, that they're going to be... I should say Activision announced that DJ Hero would contain Grandmaster Flash.

880
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:40,439
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only will he be appearing in the game as himself and among the cast of other DJs that are in the game, but he'll also be contributing two songs, including...

881
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:42,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about DJ Hero.

882
01:10:42,601 --> 01:10:44,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this game looks awesome.

883
01:10:57,984 --> 01:11:00,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, it looks really sweet.

884
01:11:00,486 --> 01:11:07,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not surprised that they're including the old, you know, some of the old, some of the famous DJs, kind of like they do in Guitar Hero, right?

885
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:11,754
[SPEAKER_05]: You have like Slash shows up and, you know, Buckethead and some of these people, so it's pretty cool.

886
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:19,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so very cool and, you know, just excited that we're gonna, we're hearing more songs coming out of it.

887
01:11:21,021 --> 01:11:21,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

888
01:11:22,182 --> 01:11:24,223
[SPEAKER_05]: What else was I wanting to say about DJ Hero?

889
01:11:24,263 --> 01:11:28,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still going to be expensive, though, of course, is the only kind of downside, but what can you do?

890
01:11:28,645 --> 01:11:31,427
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, though, it's the only game I'm buying this fall.

891
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:32,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

892
01:11:33,145 --> 01:11:34,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of all the stuff coming out this fall?

893
01:11:34,526 --> 01:11:37,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the only game I'm buying this fall.

894
01:11:37,386 --> 01:11:40,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you can't pirate the turntable.

895
01:11:40,327 --> 01:11:40,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I see how you are.

896
01:11:40,987 --> 01:11:46,989
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it really deserves my money, but yeah, it's just with kids coming, you know, really.

897
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:52,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I mean, piracy aside, you know, I'm probably not going to be playing a lot of games in the fall.

898
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,931
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be playing the Grand Theft Auto expansion, the new one, but that's for sure.

899
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:00,272
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, with kids coming, it's just like...

900
01:12:01,277 --> 01:12:02,618
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

901
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:29,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

902
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:29,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just joking.

903
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think she's in the game at all.

904
01:12:31,278 --> 01:12:34,599
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a long list of other DJs I'd rather see in the game than her.

905
01:12:34,659 --> 01:12:35,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

906
01:12:35,379 --> 01:12:35,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

907
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to make a silly little joke.

908
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

909
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:39,141
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I do.

910
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:42,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we heard a lot about download content with DJ Hero?

911
01:12:42,202 --> 01:12:42,882
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be some.

912
01:12:43,022 --> 01:12:43,922
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about all we know.

913
01:12:45,623 --> 01:12:53,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know someone actually, for whatever reason today, I visited their website and actually looked at their Twitter and there was someone asking, hey, is there going to be download content?

914
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, of course there's going to be download content.

915
01:12:56,892 --> 01:13:03,057
[SPEAKER_05]: But not necessarily regularly, like you see in Rock Band, because Guitar Hero's download content seems to be a bit more sporadic.

916
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:07,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would be guessing that it's going to be a bit more sporadic.

917
01:13:08,562 --> 01:13:13,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa Congusto in our chatroom, chat.org.com, says it could be a pixelated Lohan tweeting naked pics.

918
01:13:14,627 --> 01:13:16,469
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be true to life, wouldn't it?

919
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,491
[SPEAKER_05]: A little too true to life.

920
01:13:18,511 --> 01:13:19,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, what else do you have for us, Loki?

921
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:30,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, of course, not really something I would utilize and not really something you'd utilize anymore, but Twitter has come to Warcraft.

922
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:41,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to TweetCraft, an in-game client that you can get, you can now Twitter inside the confines of World of Warcraft.

923
01:13:43,581 --> 01:13:48,027
[SPEAKER_05]: This would actually be cool, believe it or not, if I was like a role player.

924
01:13:48,748 --> 01:13:56,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be kind of neat to have a character using a Twitter, like create a character and have them tweet about the things they're doing in World of Warcraft.

925
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,701
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's probably what most people would use it for.

926
01:14:00,142 --> 01:14:02,184
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just hope it doesn't turn into this whole like...

927
01:14:02,825 --> 01:14:04,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I just turned in this quest.

928
01:14:04,426 --> 01:14:06,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I just dinged to level 77.

929
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:08,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're running this instance.

930
01:14:08,668 --> 01:14:09,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone want to join?

931
01:14:09,348 --> 01:14:11,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we don't really need to fill Twitter up with that garbage.

932
01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:14,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope none of my personal friends are going to use this for that.

933
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:24,635
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they're using it to keep all the crack in their vein, like they play World of Warcraft and have Twitter at the same time, I can also understand the need to have that crack all at once.

934
01:14:24,955 --> 01:14:30,858
[SPEAKER_05]: All they need now is Facebook as well in World of Warcraft if they don't already have it, and then everybody's crack should be set.

935
01:14:31,998 --> 01:14:36,080
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the screenshot here, it doesn't look like they're using it for roleplay.

936
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:45,663
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, one of the people says, Thank God CNN's finally segwaying from reporting on Michael Jackson still being dead to reporting on what happened to Bubbles the Chimp.

937
01:14:47,143 --> 01:14:48,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Information we need to know right away.

938
01:14:49,424 --> 01:14:51,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm reading this stuff in chat, which is great.

939
01:14:51,564 --> 01:14:54,405
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says, Great, now you can tweet when you're in a WoW raid.

940
01:14:55,046 --> 01:14:59,347
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, At Rob, I just got a 4-strength 4-stam leather belt.

941
01:15:00,265 --> 01:15:02,306
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an All Games Inside joke, I'll have you know.

942
01:15:03,147 --> 01:15:04,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee says, Mom, bathroom!

943
01:15:09,691 --> 01:15:09,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

944
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:15,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just encourage people to not have any human interaction whatsoever by putting Twitter in World of Warcraft.

945
01:15:15,674 --> 01:15:16,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

946
01:15:16,654 --> 01:15:28,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say I'm glad I left because I'm not vindictive about the reasons I left, but I am comfortable with my decision and that there's many other games to be playing right now.

947
01:15:28,437 --> 01:15:30,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, sorry, I will say this.

948
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:37,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I am kind of sad that I feel like some people I don't talk to anymore because I don't play World of Warcraft, which is kind of sad.

949
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, just call me, dude.

950
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hang out.

951
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do something besides raiding.

952
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:44,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Hangout in World of Warcraft?

953
01:15:44,601 --> 01:15:44,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

954
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:46,622
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

955
01:15:47,562 --> 01:15:52,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And something you may need if you really are living the sedentary lifestyle.

956
01:15:52,343 --> 01:15:53,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I will never need this.

957
01:15:54,123 --> 01:16:03,945
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a new DS plug-in that you can use with your DS and DSi because it actually plugs into the DS slot and not the Game Boy Advance slot.

958
01:16:04,465 --> 01:16:05,366
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is a...

959
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:17,348
[SPEAKER_03]: a device called Digit and it's for helping diabetic kids record their sugar levels so that they can see if they're okay.

960
01:16:17,668 --> 01:16:20,709
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps them test their sugar.

961
01:16:22,769 --> 01:16:23,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

962
01:16:23,229 --> 01:16:25,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So really you can turn your DS into a diabetic monitor now?

963
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:28,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a sugar glucose reader.

964
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you can use this like

965
01:16:33,396 --> 01:16:35,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll tell you right now, your insurance ain't going to cover it.

966
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:38,358
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to be paying for that out of pocket.

967
01:16:38,798 --> 01:16:42,420
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess what it is probably, it's like a diabetic monitor.

968
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,761
[SPEAKER_05]: You know when you're diabetic, you have to track this.

969
01:16:44,961 --> 01:16:45,841
[SPEAKER_04]: My grandma was diabetic.

970
01:16:45,861 --> 01:16:47,482
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to track your glucose several times a day.

971
01:16:47,842 --> 01:16:48,923
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on how...

972
01:16:49,843 --> 01:16:51,404
[SPEAKER_05]: There's different stages of diabetes.

973
01:16:51,444 --> 01:16:52,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very common disease.

974
01:16:52,905 --> 01:16:54,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Halle Berry has diabetes.

975
01:16:54,306 --> 01:16:55,687
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of very famous people have diabetes.

976
01:16:56,267 --> 01:16:59,849
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to track your sugar levels at several points throughout the day.

977
01:17:00,409 --> 01:17:05,532
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be what they call insulin dependent, where if your levels are really out of whack, you have to inject yourself with insulin.

978
01:17:05,873 --> 01:17:13,277
[SPEAKER_05]: This monitor, if they're encouraging kids to use this monitor with their DS, is probably a way to track those levels, but more so for their parents to look at it, I bet.

979
01:17:14,257 --> 01:17:16,719
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually kind of a neat use of technology.

980
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:19,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think it's kind of a neat use of the DS.

981
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:25,123
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a feel-good CNN good news story of the week type thing.

982
01:17:25,723 --> 01:17:27,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Nintendo didn't think of it first.

983
01:17:29,265 --> 01:17:30,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw you, Vitality Monitor.

984
01:17:31,998 --> 01:17:36,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Catanagram in chat says, Loki, yeah, this looks like Bayer's rebranding of the Glucoboy Independent.

985
01:17:37,141 --> 01:17:40,624
[SPEAKER_05]: They look the same, so I'm guessing Bayer bought the tech from the guy that made Glucoboy.

986
01:17:40,804 --> 01:17:41,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

987
01:17:41,464 --> 01:17:41,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.

988
01:17:42,485 --> 01:17:42,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

989
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:47,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee asks in chat, when can I have the Wii Fit glaucoma meter?

990
01:17:51,283 --> 01:17:52,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it's a pretty neat idea.

991
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:58,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, look, you brought up World of Warcraft earlier, and I wanted to talk about this a little bit because I thought this story was very interesting.

992
01:17:58,854 --> 01:18:04,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Having been in a game that was ruined by gold farming, or in that particular game, gill farming...

993
01:18:05,504 --> 01:18:06,385
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

994
01:18:29,764 --> 01:18:32,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're aware, but not really.

995
01:18:32,445 --> 01:18:34,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not really what happened.

996
01:18:34,505 --> 01:18:45,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what China really banned, was using virtual money for gambling and will be punished by public security authorities, and miners cannot buy virtual money.

997
01:18:46,109 --> 01:18:47,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what it really comes down to.

998
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, A, it's minors, too.

999
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:50,670
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not adults.

1000
01:18:50,951 --> 01:18:57,693
[SPEAKER_05]: But also the fact that the real problem, and Richard Heeks, who is a professor at the University of Manchester, kind of breaks it down.

1001
01:18:58,853 --> 01:19:01,374
[SPEAKER_05]: What it really is is using these fake currencies.

1002
01:19:02,434 --> 01:19:04,356
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the big ones is called QQ Coins.

1003
01:19:05,577 --> 01:19:07,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Used to buy real... I know, funny, huh?

1004
01:19:07,839 --> 01:19:09,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Used to... QQ, I don't have any real money.

1005
01:19:10,561 --> 01:19:14,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Using these QQ Coins to pay for virtual game stuff.

1006
01:19:14,744 --> 01:19:17,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently some folks were using them to pay for real things.

1007
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:45,093
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's what the law is to prevent using virtual currency to buy real products that's what it comes down to and most people are when you do gold farming that's the other way around you're paying real money for virtual items that's still okay it's the other way around that is now illegal which isn't going to impact any of the gold farming industry I'm sorry to say and that makes everyone go QQ exactly because the QQ dollars are still out there that's all I got

1008
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:46,927
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.

1009
01:19:47,668 --> 01:19:49,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think they should ban the real thing?

1010
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:53,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they can.

1011
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:54,911
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I'm at.

1012
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:56,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you know what?

1013
01:19:56,772 --> 01:19:57,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Why bother at this point?

1014
01:19:57,993 --> 01:19:58,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It's out there.

1015
01:19:58,653 --> 01:20:02,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up to the game makers, I think, to some extent, to stop this shit if they want to.

1016
01:20:03,115 --> 01:20:03,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Really.

1017
01:20:04,096 --> 01:20:06,877
[SPEAKER_05]: If they really wanted to stop this crap, they could, but most don't.

1018
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:14,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, you know, as much as I see, you know, it's not a good thing to buy money...

1019
01:20:15,669 --> 01:20:16,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1020
01:20:33,973 --> 01:20:36,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, it also depends on the game's design.

1021
01:20:36,634 --> 01:20:39,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't think gold farming is that big of an epidemic in World of Warcraft.

1022
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:40,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's out there.

1023
01:20:40,555 --> 01:20:41,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's being done.

1024
01:20:41,815 --> 01:20:44,476
[SPEAKER_05]: But in World of Warcraft, it's not that hard to make money.

1025
01:20:44,996 --> 01:20:45,796
[SPEAKER_05]: They have dailies.

1026
01:20:45,836 --> 01:20:46,856
[SPEAKER_05]: They have ways to make money.

1027
01:20:47,156 --> 01:20:48,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Gold farming is for lazy people.

1028
01:20:48,917 --> 01:20:50,637
[SPEAKER_05]: If people are too lazy to make gold the hard way.

1029
01:20:50,877 --> 01:20:51,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's the thing.

1030
01:20:51,457 --> 01:20:54,238
[SPEAKER_05]: In Final Fantasy XI, you couldn't make gil that easily.

1031
01:20:54,498 --> 01:20:56,518
[SPEAKER_05]: You could not make gil as easily as you can make money.

1032
01:20:56,798 --> 01:20:57,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And some would argue with me.

1033
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:58,879
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to camp, like, on a really

1034
01:20:59,099 --> 01:20:59,480
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

1035
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:20,468
[SPEAKER_05]: is that, you know, gill farming was an epidemic and it was killing the game because what would happen is, yeah, what was the only way to make gill?

1036
01:21:20,729 --> 01:21:24,754
[SPEAKER_05]: You camp these notorious monsters that would drop items that would be worth millions of gill.

1037
01:21:24,995 --> 01:21:25,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

1038
01:21:25,555 --> 01:21:28,139
[SPEAKER_05]: All the gold farmers are out there camping with you and they got good at it.

1039
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,362
[SPEAKER_05]: But WoW doesn't have that as an epidemic.

1040
01:21:30,783 --> 01:21:30,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1041
01:21:31,923 --> 01:21:44,691
[SPEAKER_05]: you know finally years later they changed it in Final Fantasy where the items would bind a certain way you know it just took them too damn long to do it lessons again I hope they have learned moving into Final Fantasy XIV because Final Fantasy XIV has the potential to be amazing

1042
01:21:45,643 --> 01:21:51,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Ramma S in our chatroom, chat.orangehauntry.com Now with Final Fantasy XIV, will they shut down Final Fantasy XI?

1043
01:21:51,469 --> 01:21:51,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Hardly.

1044
01:21:52,169 --> 01:21:52,670
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1045
01:21:53,571 --> 01:21:56,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Will they have to do server consolidations and things of this sort?

1046
01:21:56,073 --> 01:21:56,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

1047
01:21:56,774 --> 01:21:57,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Will they lose players?

1048
01:21:57,755 --> 01:21:58,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

1049
01:21:58,856 --> 01:22:01,178
[SPEAKER_05]: But they'll probably charge more for Final Fantasy XIV.

1050
01:22:01,478 --> 01:22:05,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot more, but they'll probably charge like $14.95 or $15.95 a month.

1051
01:22:05,582 --> 01:22:06,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they could probably get away with it.

1052
01:22:08,047 --> 01:22:08,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss Eleven.

1053
01:22:08,407 --> 01:22:09,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of fun with it.

1054
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:10,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the time for an MMO anyway.

1055
01:22:10,489 --> 01:22:12,950
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.

1056
01:22:31,519 --> 01:22:33,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I am definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.

1057
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all over that shit.

1058
01:22:34,281 --> 01:22:37,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not looking forward to it because I won't be able to play it, probably.

1059
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:37,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor thing.

1060
01:22:38,524 --> 01:22:39,985
[SPEAKER_05]: What you can do, come over to my house.

1061
01:22:40,285 --> 01:22:40,726
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play.

1062
01:22:41,226 --> 01:22:43,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, tell the wife you're coming over to hang out with Rob.

1063
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:44,388
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to watch movies.

1064
01:22:44,408 --> 01:22:48,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to do that either because babies... Bring the kids.

1065
01:22:50,312 --> 01:22:51,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them into it.

1066
01:22:51,273 --> 01:22:52,013
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

1067
01:22:53,054 --> 01:22:53,314
[SPEAKER_03]: You know...

1068
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I... Nellie doesn't want the kids playing video games.

1069
01:22:57,622 --> 01:23:01,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, basically she doesn't want them ignoring homework to play the video games.

1070
01:23:02,045 --> 01:23:02,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is fine.

1071
01:23:02,905 --> 01:23:04,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, because you know what?

1072
01:23:04,586 --> 01:23:05,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I never did that.

1073
01:23:05,567 --> 01:23:11,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I always did my homework, and then, well, I mostly did my homework, and I didn't really play video games.

1074
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,591
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't an issue like that, but...

1075
01:23:13,968 --> 01:23:14,849
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna play video games

1076
01:23:29,108 --> 01:23:29,828
[SPEAKER_05]: for two hours.

1077
01:23:30,209 --> 01:23:40,773
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to watch cartoons, you want to play video games, whatever the F you want to do on the TV, I wouldn't say that, obviously, but whatever the F, and me explaining it to you, whatever the F you want to do for the TV with two hours, that's yours.

1078
01:23:41,173 --> 01:23:46,635
[SPEAKER_05]: But either A, once your homework gets done first, or B, once your two hours is up, you better be doing your homework.

1079
01:23:47,215 --> 01:23:48,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you're going to lose your TV time.

1080
01:23:49,236 --> 01:23:50,537
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, something like that.

1081
01:23:50,657 --> 01:23:52,297
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the kind of system I think you have to do.

1082
01:23:52,498 --> 01:23:53,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Always homework first.

1083
01:23:53,298 --> 01:23:55,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1084
01:23:55,699 --> 01:23:57,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's talk a little bit about...

1085
01:24:00,325 --> 01:24:06,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, can I say, can I say, because this is obviously a sparked discussion in our chat room, I have to read this at chat.orangelunchradio.com.

1086
01:24:06,267 --> 01:24:19,973
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, about Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, SJ100Matt says they still, they said they will continue to release expansion for Final Fantasy XI, and especially now that they're doing the download expansions now, like there's the MOG, the coup d'etat, or whatever they call it, the

1087
01:24:20,293 --> 01:24:23,095
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1088
01:24:42,757 --> 01:24:44,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, some comments on the babies.

1089
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,762
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says, they're going to play video games while parents are asleep.

1090
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:49,943
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

1091
01:24:50,343 --> 01:24:53,345
[SPEAKER_05]: If the TV is in the kids' room with the console, they're going to play the video games while you sleep.

1092
01:24:53,365 --> 01:24:54,426
[SPEAKER_05]: TV's not going to be in the kids' room.

1093
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:59,050
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 says, from kindergarten through third grade, my parents would only let me play video games on weekends.

1094
01:25:00,351 --> 01:25:04,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking, you know, the kids can play not the new console games.

1095
01:25:04,674 --> 01:25:10,899
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got to play the old stuff, because the old stuff is more family-friendly, you know, whereas the new stuff, you know, no playing Grand Theft Auto.

1096
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:11,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Although,

1097
01:25:12,364 --> 01:25:17,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Although with Grand Theft Auto, I know enough about hacking it that I could probably take out the blood and stuff.

1098
01:25:18,549 --> 01:25:23,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa Congusto in chat says, My dad had a really good parenting strategy so I couldn't play too many video games.

1099
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:25,754
[SPEAKER_05]: He played them so I couldn't.

1100
01:25:27,095 --> 01:25:27,935
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more like it.

1101
01:25:28,396 --> 01:25:31,318
[SPEAKER_05]: You should suggest that to the wife.

1102
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:33,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only playing video games so the kids can do their homework.

1103
01:25:35,001 --> 01:25:35,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing you a favor.

1104
01:25:36,262 --> 01:25:36,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Now cook dinner.

1105
01:25:38,043 --> 01:25:38,723
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't cook.

1106
01:25:38,843 --> 01:25:39,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I cook dinner.

1107
01:26:10,618 --> 01:26:21,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, tech thing that they, I guess, registered a patent for that's gonna utilize what looks like a giant square-shaped U thing, almost like a...

1108
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:27,183
[SPEAKER_03]: The U-Force, you know, kind of scary enough, but apparently you would use this device in your hands.

1109
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:42,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess to replace the Cosmic Ice Cream Cone thing, but you would use it, I guess, like a baseball bat or golf club or sword, whatever.

1110
01:26:42,454 --> 01:26:43,575
[SPEAKER_05]: That thing's going to get broken.

1111
01:26:44,336 --> 01:26:47,518
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing looks retarded, if you ask me.

1112
01:26:47,598 --> 01:26:48,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe it was just patented.

1113
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,140
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't necessarily mean they're going to use it.

1114
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1115
01:26:51,261 --> 01:26:51,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I just...

1116
01:26:52,902 --> 01:26:54,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Giant U of Death.

1117
01:26:55,363 --> 01:26:58,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Catanagram is saying that's just a random object, not a controller.

1118
01:26:58,184 --> 01:27:01,625
[SPEAKER_05]: That the U is supposed to represent some type of object the person has in their home.

1119
01:27:01,945 --> 01:27:07,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I had thought I had read is something about that you can use this thing is supposed to be like so any object can be used in the game.

1120
01:27:08,147 --> 01:27:09,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is kind of similar.

1121
01:27:09,108 --> 01:27:10,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that similar to what Natal was saying too?

1122
01:27:10,928 --> 01:27:11,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1123
01:27:11,228 --> 01:27:14,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be able to scan like the kid's skateboard in a little preview.

1124
01:27:14,049 --> 01:27:15,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well that, yeah.

1125
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So something similar here, right?

1126
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:17,910
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll work as well as they show.

1127
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:18,271
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.

1128
01:27:20,283 --> 01:27:21,364
[SPEAKER_03]: That's neat.

1129
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:26,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the idea of swinging around something that even resembles a baseball bat in my house.

1130
01:27:27,786 --> 01:27:28,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's a Nerf bat.

1131
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:30,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Even then.

1132
01:27:30,347 --> 01:27:32,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't you just roll up a piece of paper and tell the game it's a bat?

1133
01:27:33,468 --> 01:27:34,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It would work, right?

1134
01:27:35,309 --> 01:27:36,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll up a newspaper?

1135
01:27:36,169 --> 01:27:36,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Thunk.

1136
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't I hold up the cat and say it's a baseball bat?

1137
01:27:39,771 --> 01:27:39,891
Meow.

1138
01:27:41,499 --> 01:27:44,941
[SPEAKER_03]: How long is it gonna take before someone tries to use their penis on this?

1139
01:27:45,521 --> 01:27:46,562
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna happen.

1140
01:27:47,082 --> 01:27:49,743
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the age-old question about new peripherals.

1141
01:27:49,823 --> 01:27:51,724
[SPEAKER_05]: How long before a penis is used with it?

1142
01:27:52,065 --> 01:27:52,565
[SPEAKER_05]: How long?

1143
01:27:53,846 --> 01:27:54,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Try 30 seconds.

1144
01:27:56,087 --> 01:27:59,629
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the length of time to unzip the pants and undo the belt buckle.

1145
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:01,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Scan this!

1146
01:28:04,907 --> 01:28:05,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1147
01:28:05,527 --> 01:28:05,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1148
01:28:06,028 --> 01:28:06,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, look.

1149
01:28:06,468 --> 01:28:07,689
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some emails we gotta read.

1150
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:08,770
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get to the mailbag.

1151
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:09,350
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that sound?

1152
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:15,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is where you send your emails every week and we read some of our favorites here on the show.

1153
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:17,617
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what I'm gonna do right now.

1154
01:28:17,937 --> 01:28:19,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Since DarkSakura's not here tonight, I will read them.

1155
01:28:20,099 --> 01:28:24,862
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can scan objects to be used as guns, you can have your own laser cat.

1156
01:28:26,283 --> 01:28:28,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, whatever happened to laser cat the video game?

1157
01:28:28,565 --> 01:28:30,527
[SPEAKER_05]: You think with community games we would have this now?

1158
01:28:31,127 --> 01:28:31,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised we don't.

1159
01:28:34,567 --> 01:28:36,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I had the music blurring that whole time.

1160
01:28:36,469 --> 01:28:39,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email.

1161
01:28:39,692 --> 01:28:42,574
[SPEAKER_05]: First email to us tonight comes from Rick.

1162
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:46,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rick sent us an email and the subject is Nintendo Divorce Notice.

1163
01:28:47,844 --> 01:28:48,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1164
01:29:15,595 --> 01:29:17,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Wii came along and life was good again.

1165
01:29:18,236 --> 01:29:24,137
[SPEAKER_05]: We had such good times together with Zelda, Metroid, and Mario, but there was something wrong, something nagging in the back of my mind.

1166
01:29:24,658 --> 01:29:27,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be all the shovelware that was becoming more and more common?

1167
01:29:27,398 --> 01:29:30,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be all the ported games with Waggle attached for no fucking reason?

1168
01:29:31,019 --> 01:29:32,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be last year's E3?

1169
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:34,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be all the party games?

1170
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,080
[SPEAKER_05]: What's next?

1171
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion Control?

1172
01:29:36,081 --> 01:29:36,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yaris?

1173
01:29:37,363 --> 01:29:38,084
[SPEAKER_05]: you let me down yet again

1174
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Why should I stay?

1175
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:52,641
[SPEAKER_05]: What can you offer me as a reason to hang around?

1176
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:55,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Why shouldn't I just go and sell my Wii and put the money towards a PlayStation 3?

1177
01:29:56,983 --> 01:29:58,083
[SPEAKER_05]: More Mario Galaxy?

1178
01:29:58,123 --> 01:29:59,183
[SPEAKER_05]: You lazy bastards.

1179
01:29:59,223 --> 01:30:00,784
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just fat you trimmed from Galaxy 1.

1180
01:30:01,664 --> 01:30:02,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario multiplayer?

1181
01:30:02,785 --> 01:30:03,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Ported from the DS.

1182
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:04,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Zelda?

1183
01:30:04,845 --> 01:30:05,345
[SPEAKER_05]: A painting?

1184
01:30:05,606 --> 01:30:06,486
[SPEAKER_05]: A frickin' poster?

1185
01:30:06,786 --> 01:30:11,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said the Zelda game actually is not going to be very different than the first one, which means it's going to be written on the same engine.

1186
01:30:12,028 --> 01:30:14,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm reading this poor man's pleas to the divorce court.

1187
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:16,409
[SPEAKER_05]: A statement about no sword?

1188
01:30:16,629 --> 01:30:17,090
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it?

1189
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:17,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Get fucked!

1190
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:19,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Kid Ikea RS

1191
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:22,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's there.

1192
01:30:22,536 --> 01:30:22,976
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming.

1193
01:30:23,036 --> 01:30:23,637
[SPEAKER_05]: News flash.

1194
01:30:23,657 --> 01:30:24,337
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't care anymore.

1195
01:30:25,158 --> 01:30:28,581
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, I'm going to be a dad soon, and my time will be a precious commodity.

1196
01:30:29,001 --> 01:30:30,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to know that you are taking things seriously.

1197
01:30:30,863 --> 01:30:33,244
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I'm walking to the nearest Sony store.

1198
01:30:33,745 --> 01:30:34,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so sad.

1199
01:30:34,926 --> 01:30:38,208
[SPEAKER_05]: You used to try so hard and produce such wonderful gaming experiences.

1200
01:30:38,549 --> 01:30:39,669
[SPEAKER_05]: You were top of the pile.

1201
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:43,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're more bothered about coming on to my grandmother and small children.

1202
01:30:43,853 --> 01:30:45,234
[SPEAKER_05]: You disgust me, Nintendo.

1203
01:30:45,714 --> 01:30:46,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Regards, Rick.

1204
01:30:47,255 --> 01:30:47,576
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1205
01:30:47,736 --> 01:30:49,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I get custody of the Nintendog.

1206
01:30:51,308 --> 01:30:55,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we will see how that holds up in divorce court with Judge... Who is it in divorce court?

1207
01:30:55,469 --> 01:30:56,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Judge Mabel?

1208
01:30:56,029 --> 01:30:57,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's Judge Mabel.

1209
01:30:57,649 --> 01:31:00,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, if he's in the UK, he's not even going to get that joke, so forget it.

1210
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:01,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1211
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:06,331
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a well-written divorce letter, and I can't say I... It's tough.

1212
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:13,652
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough being a hardcore gaming fan and watching what's going on with the Wii, but at the same time, I think he summed it up right at the end.

1213
01:31:13,892 --> 01:31:18,433
[SPEAKER_05]: They're more interested in hitting on your grandmother and little children, and they're doing a good job of it.

1214
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,233
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't deny that.

1215
01:31:20,073 --> 01:31:20,253
[SPEAKER_05]: But

1216
01:31:21,364 --> 01:31:23,125
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just not the bread and butter for Nintendo anymore.

1217
01:31:23,185 --> 01:31:26,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Nintendo felt they already lost us between the 64 and the GameCube.

1218
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:27,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1219
01:31:27,948 --> 01:31:28,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wait not to try.

1220
01:31:29,569 --> 01:31:34,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But my thought is a lot of us were children or at least younger when those systems were out.

1221
01:31:34,972 --> 01:31:35,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, wouldn't you?

1222
01:31:36,012 --> 01:31:36,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1223
01:31:36,713 --> 01:31:44,337
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is they're kind of catering to stupid people, but they think that people like

1224
01:31:45,445 --> 01:31:48,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, games are so hard, I can't play them.

1225
01:31:48,527 --> 01:31:51,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you give it to a kid, he's going to figure it out.

1226
01:31:51,608 --> 01:31:56,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was a kid, I figured out how to play video games.

1227
01:31:56,771 --> 01:32:00,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I may not have been good at it at first, but it took time.

1228
01:32:00,353 --> 01:32:01,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to practice, get better.

1229
01:32:02,354 --> 01:32:04,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And nowadays, I think kids should do the same thing.

1230
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:08,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if they're just immediately great at it, then good.

1231
01:32:08,437 --> 01:32:11,178
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives them a self-esteem boost, but they still suck.

1232
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:12,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the game is really easy.

1233
01:32:14,672 --> 01:32:22,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm looking in chat and some folks want the emailer to understand about Metroid Other M. They neglected in their whole little statement there.

1234
01:32:23,077 --> 01:32:25,878
[SPEAKER_05]: But J-Rod offered up this interesting retort.

1235
01:32:26,338 --> 01:32:30,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I can think of at least three games from both Sony and Microsoft from E3 that I want on day one.

1236
01:32:30,541 --> 01:32:33,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo had one game during a two hour conference.

1237
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:36,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1238
01:32:51,994 --> 01:32:52,995
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1239
01:33:21,325 --> 01:33:22,626
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very serious turtle.

1240
01:33:22,646 --> 01:33:23,826
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to take this very seriously.

1241
01:33:24,526 --> 01:33:27,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, a couple months ago I discovered Podcast Alley and thus your show.

1242
01:33:27,928 --> 01:33:29,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot we were listed on Podcast Alley.

1243
01:33:29,548 --> 01:33:31,709
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an old school podcasting list.

1244
01:33:32,109 --> 01:33:32,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1245
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:34,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my lucky stars.

1246
01:33:36,951 --> 01:33:38,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been needing a show like this my whole life.

1247
01:33:40,205 --> 01:33:46,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any friends who are hardcore gamers like me so when I heard your show it was fantastic to hear people like me who talked about the things I care about.

1248
01:33:46,988 --> 01:33:50,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for all the time you invest in this show and tell Loki to stop yelling the turtle.

1249
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:51,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1250
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:52,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a problem.

1251
01:33:55,031 --> 01:34:00,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, this serious turtle has a serious issue with you, Loki, and that is that you yell too damn much.

1252
01:34:00,293 --> 01:34:01,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta talk to you about something.

1253
01:34:01,534 --> 01:34:02,014
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.

1254
01:34:02,154 --> 01:34:02,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

1255
01:34:02,514 --> 01:34:05,155
[SPEAKER_03]: This is gonna totally go on a tangent, but it's funny.

1256
01:34:05,275 --> 01:34:05,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

1257
01:34:06,216 --> 01:34:12,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So, apparently earlier this week, Nelly was convinced that I had Asperger's Syndrome.

1258
01:34:13,522 --> 01:34:15,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that kind of like... It's like autism.

1259
01:34:15,925 --> 01:34:18,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so your wife thinks you're autistic, yes.

1260
01:34:18,848 --> 01:34:28,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because apparently people stricken with Asperger's, they have the tendency to be very focused on certain things or whatever.

1261
01:34:28,299 --> 01:34:30,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I piss her off a lot by like...

1262
01:34:32,023 --> 01:34:32,924
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1263
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1264
01:35:20,588 --> 01:35:22,091
[SPEAKER_05]: This show just isn't enough, Loki.

1265
01:35:22,632 --> 01:35:25,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I do this at work.

1266
01:35:25,235 --> 01:35:28,981
[SPEAKER_05]: You've spent at least seven years of your life getting the gaming knowledge out there.

1267
01:35:29,001 --> 01:35:31,004
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way, this radio station is perfect for you.

1268
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's as perfect.

1269
01:35:33,768 --> 01:35:34,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to a doctor and...

1270
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:43,633
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, there's no, there's nothing that has to do with that because it's actually, you're very socially, you know, unable to cope with everything, basically.

1271
01:35:43,953 --> 01:35:46,074
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't, you can't function in society.

1272
01:35:46,174 --> 01:35:49,875
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not medical professionals, we're not even going to try and get into it, but it's, you know.

1273
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:54,457
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny because there's a lot of symptoms on there and they're like the different work fields that would be perfect for you.

1274
01:35:54,597 --> 01:35:59,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but look, you go into WebMD, like, and you tell WebMD you have certain symptoms.

1275
01:35:59,859 --> 01:36:01,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got this and this and this and this.

1276
01:36:01,219 --> 01:36:02,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time it tells you, cancer.

1277
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:09,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time you go in there and you're like, oh, I've got a rash on my ass and it kind of, you know, it flames a little.

1278
01:36:09,542 --> 01:36:10,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you have ass cancer.

1279
01:36:10,722 --> 01:36:11,382
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like.

1280
01:36:13,103 --> 01:36:14,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like, or yeah.

1281
01:36:16,824 --> 01:36:19,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all yes or no, it's not the tumor.

1282
01:36:20,305 --> 01:36:22,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry to get off on a tangent there.

1283
01:36:22,146 --> 01:36:23,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it was funny.

1284
01:36:24,929 --> 01:36:25,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1285
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:26,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

1286
01:36:27,511 --> 01:36:28,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please, next email.

1287
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:31,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop trying to talk about things you know nothing about.

1288
01:36:32,355 --> 01:36:32,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1289
01:36:33,376 --> 01:36:34,877
[SPEAKER_05]: This comes to us from Deathwishing.

1290
01:36:35,874 --> 01:36:38,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I have not been involved in your shows for a long time.

1291
01:36:39,035 --> 01:36:39,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Have I missed a lot?

1292
01:36:40,135 --> 01:36:40,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1293
01:36:40,995 --> 01:36:42,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, now to get on with some email material.

1294
01:36:42,836 --> 01:36:45,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys ever heard of a game called Urban Terror?

1295
01:36:45,557 --> 01:36:50,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you have not, then there is no reason to not try the game because, well, it's absolutely free.

1296
01:36:51,258 --> 01:36:55,059
[SPEAKER_05]: It was originally a Quake 3 mod and then went into its own standalone game.

1297
01:36:55,500 --> 01:37:03,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot describe how it plays, but I guess it's a mix, I think a combination of Counter-Strike and Quake, hence it being a Quake 3 mod.

1298
01:37:04,062 --> 01:37:06,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's hope I don't miss the cast again.

1299
01:37:07,664 --> 01:37:08,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of this.

1300
01:37:09,025 --> 01:37:09,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Urban Terror?

1301
01:37:10,506 --> 01:37:18,891
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I've heard of, there was a Urban Chaos or something like that game that was from Eidos or something that really sucked.

1302
01:37:19,772 --> 01:37:20,812
[SPEAKER_03]: But that sounds kind of neat.

1303
01:37:23,134 --> 01:37:25,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Email number four from Shook.

1304
01:37:26,411 --> 01:37:32,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi everyone, I've been following this show for about three months and I can honestly say that this is the best video game related show I've ever listened to.

1305
01:37:32,255 --> 01:37:32,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Why thank you.

1306
01:37:33,456 --> 01:37:38,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I encourage you guys to keep doing this show and if you're reading this on the 7th anniversary, I wish to congratulate you on the feat.

1307
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:42,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're a week late, but that's probably my fault because the 7th anniversary show still hasn't hit the feat.

1308
01:37:42,382 --> 01:37:45,365
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you nonetheless, 7th anniversary or not.

1309
01:37:45,645 --> 01:37:48,847
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll say that's a pre-grats for our 8th anniversary.

1310
01:37:49,167 --> 01:37:49,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there you go.

1311
01:37:50,891 --> 01:37:53,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Last email tonight from the one and only Spazinator.

1312
01:37:53,393 --> 01:37:57,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi everyone, I thought I'd write this email for tonight's show mainly to share a tidbit of info.

1313
01:37:58,156 --> 01:38:01,618
[SPEAKER_05]: By the looks of things, Sony will be doing three things more or less in tandem this summer.

1314
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:10,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Rolling out the long rumored PS3 Slim, drop the price of the PS3 by an unknown amount, and release firmware 3.0 which by most accounts will be a fairly big overhaul.

1315
01:38:10,884 --> 01:38:14,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm reading this email because we've addressed some of this but we didn't really talk about new firmware.

1316
01:38:14,947 --> 01:38:24,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Most sources agree that Firmware 3.0 has certain features on it similar to what Xbox Live has, reputation and griefing procedures, as well as finally being able to download game updates in the background.

1317
01:38:24,435 --> 01:38:32,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Where there is still some debate as to whether or not Firmware 3.0 will also incorporate the recently uncovered patented PS2 emulator that will supposedly work on all PS3s.

1318
01:38:33,002 --> 01:38:40,448
[SPEAKER_05]: My suspicions are that the emulator will indeed be coming, most likely in Firmware 3.0, or at least in the next major firmware update after that.

1319
01:38:40,848 --> 01:38:41,628
[SPEAKER_05]: My reasoning is this.

1320
01:38:41,929 --> 01:38:48,111
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no reason for any company, Sony or any other one, to patent anything unless they see a way to make money off of it, directly or indirectly.

1321
01:38:48,671 --> 01:38:59,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing as the PlayStation 3 sales have been lagging behind the Wii's and the 360's, hell, even the PS2's, these moves that I have mentioned should, in theory, bolster sales, which is ultimately what Sony and some third-party developers want.

1322
01:39:00,296 --> 01:39:05,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, this is all just hearsay, educated guessing on my part until we see here something official.

1323
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:11,444
[SPEAKER_05]: However, given my track record in as far as relaying info, it's subsequently being true.

1324
01:39:11,564 --> 01:39:14,246
[SPEAKER_05]: See a prior story I relayed regarding Capcom releasing games on PSN.

1325
01:39:14,646 --> 01:39:16,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Odds are this will be proven true as well.

1326
01:39:16,768 --> 01:39:17,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a bit of a...

1327
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:34,717
[SPEAKER_03]: and it also makes sense too because if you think about it it kind of eases them into digital distribution with PS3 games because you have the PS2 games coming out now and I'm assuming those are going to be at a higher price point than the PlayStation 1 games were you know for the most part I would assume that they're going to be maybe around you know

1328
01:39:35,418 --> 01:39:39,443
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 to... I would say even 15 to like $30.

1329
01:39:39,543 --> 01:39:41,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe $15.25-ish.

1330
01:39:42,186 --> 01:39:51,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that does well, then of course that means, hey, let's release some PlayStation 3 games for more money as well and see if we can get away with selling those.

1331
01:39:51,498 --> 01:39:51,679
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1332
01:39:53,503 --> 01:39:57,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure we'll probably see this stuff later this year.

1333
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for taking this email.

1334
01:40:17,621 --> 01:40:19,484
[SPEAKER_05]: It's appreciated, and keep up the excellent work.

1335
01:40:19,524 --> 01:40:23,248
[SPEAKER_05]: This email was brought to you by Loki's tingle costume, which kindly asks him to wear it.

1336
01:40:23,588 --> 01:40:23,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Lol.

1337
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:26,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Thus ends the email bag tonight.

1338
01:40:26,511 --> 01:40:27,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1339
01:40:27,913 --> 01:40:29,935
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have an email you want to send us in a future week.

1340
01:40:30,276 --> 01:40:31,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, no tingle costume.

1341
01:40:31,918 --> 01:40:33,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that you are about 800,000 copies shy.

1342
01:40:36,693 --> 01:40:38,354
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, he hasn't even made the costume yet.

1343
01:40:38,374 --> 01:40:40,496
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to get to like 50,000 shorts.

1344
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never going to happen.

1345
01:40:41,597 --> 01:40:42,757
[SPEAKER_03]: They've stopped making the game.

1346
01:40:42,837 --> 01:40:43,278
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done.

1347
01:40:43,298 --> 01:40:43,938
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

1348
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:44,819
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a done deal.

1349
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Now all of you should be focusing on a new bet.

1350
01:40:48,482 --> 01:40:49,342
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get Loki to take it.

1351
01:40:49,362 --> 01:40:51,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, I am not making any bets on the PSP Go.

1352
01:40:52,064 --> 01:40:52,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1353
01:40:53,225 --> 01:41:05,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that's going to do because there are a lot of... To be honest, I have a problem with people buying the iPhone because I think it's retarded, but there are people out there that like to spend a lot of money on stuff that's kind of...

1354
01:41:05,939 --> 01:41:07,481
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are going to have to think really hard.

1355
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:09,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, Frisbee brings up a good point.

1356
01:41:09,444 --> 01:41:10,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Sackboy costume was better anyway.

1357
01:41:11,126 --> 01:41:13,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not forget Loki did dress up as Sackboy, which was pretty cool.

1358
01:41:13,449 --> 01:41:13,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1359
01:41:14,149 --> 01:41:16,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the head now in my garage.

1360
01:41:16,292 --> 01:41:17,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it scared the hell out of me when I first saw it.

1361
01:41:18,695 --> 01:41:22,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, some more news, then we'll get into some release dates and the FUs of the week as well.

1362
01:41:23,606 --> 01:41:24,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1363
01:41:25,047 --> 01:41:32,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit about Xbox 360.

1364
01:41:32,871 --> 01:41:41,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time they've got some information on that and how it will be integrated into the new Xbox experience.

1365
01:41:42,296 --> 01:42:10,020
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently Last.fm is going to be free for gold subscribers however if you are a silver member you do get to use 3 hours per month and if you're a I guess you'll have to shell out I guess another $36 a year if you're a silver member and just want to use Last.fm which you might as well buy a fucking gold subscription at that point yeah

1366
01:42:11,587 --> 01:42:13,428
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1367
01:42:27,097 --> 01:42:33,340
[SPEAKER_05]: My thought is, this isn't... Now, my hope was that I'd be able to use Last.fm as my in-game music, but that's not really what they're going for, is it?

1368
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,101
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just going to be like a cable channel or something.

1369
01:42:36,121 --> 01:42:36,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, yeah.

1370
01:42:36,842 --> 01:42:38,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like the cable music channel.

1371
01:42:38,363 --> 01:42:40,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Instant Party just added Last.fm or something.

1372
01:42:40,724 --> 01:42:41,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1373
01:42:41,524 --> 01:42:43,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I have yet to really hear, what is this used for?

1374
01:42:44,666 --> 01:42:45,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1375
01:42:45,406 --> 01:42:47,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you can use it as in-game music, because that would be pretty cool.

1376
01:42:47,887 --> 01:42:48,608
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be pretty cool.

1377
01:42:48,628 --> 01:42:49,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was hoping for.

1378
01:42:49,228 --> 01:42:53,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually trying out the custom soundtracks with Fuel the other day.

1379
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:53,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, me too.

1380
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:54,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny.

1381
01:42:54,690 --> 01:42:54,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1382
01:42:56,338 --> 01:42:57,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuel doesn't have the greatest soundtrack.

1383
01:42:57,778 --> 01:42:58,339
[SPEAKER_05]: It really doesn't.

1384
01:42:58,839 --> 01:43:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got what I like to call sight truck syndrome, where you add new music to it and it instantly makes the game better.

1385
01:43:08,241 --> 01:43:08,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1386
01:43:09,021 --> 01:43:09,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alright.

1387
01:43:11,642 --> 01:43:17,143
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I've never used Last.fm on PC, so I don't really know if it's something that I'd be really excited about, to be honest.

1388
01:43:17,263 --> 01:43:25,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I like listening to new music and discovering new artists and stuff, but I don't think they have as eclectic taste as I would have, you know.

1389
01:43:26,317 --> 01:43:26,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1390
01:43:27,237 --> 01:43:29,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll check it out because I am a gold member.

1391
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:32,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too bad it's not Live 365 instead of Last.fm.

1392
01:43:32,398 --> 01:43:32,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

1393
01:43:33,018 --> 01:43:34,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying something nice about Live 365.

1394
01:43:35,159 --> 01:43:40,660
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, we might almost consider going back if they could have that on Xbox Marketplace.

1395
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how about we do Shoutcast?

1396
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:42,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1397
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:42,940
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1398
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:43,900
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Shoutcast?

1399
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:44,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1400
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:50,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you can have all games radio on there, which would include us, of course, and all the other great stations that come with Shoutcast.

1401
01:43:50,561 --> 01:43:51,242
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

1402
01:43:51,282 --> 01:43:52,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe... And IRC.

1403
01:43:52,422 --> 01:43:53,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's add IRC in there, too.

1404
01:43:54,449 --> 01:43:55,450
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't need a PC.

1405
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:56,410
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just do it through the 360.

1406
01:43:56,951 --> 01:43:57,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1407
01:43:58,191 --> 01:43:59,953
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I would love to have this show.

1408
01:44:00,813 --> 01:44:05,996
[SPEAKER_05]: You can already hear it on your PSP, which is cool, but that's like one system out of a lot.

1409
01:44:06,437 --> 01:44:09,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's one nice thing I could say about the PSP.

1410
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:13,881
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, we wouldn't really go back to Life 365 chat.

1411
01:44:13,961 --> 01:44:14,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't panic.

1412
01:44:14,642 --> 01:44:15,703
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not really going to do that.

1413
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides, you know what's funny?

1414
01:44:18,481 --> 01:44:29,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that since the show has actually kind of grown a little bit in numbers since we kind of combined with Bobby and we have some of the holdovers from his show and I know he gets a boost from us, I don't think we could do the show on Life 365 anymore without being a professional station.

1415
01:44:29,225 --> 01:44:29,926
[SPEAKER_05]: We have too many people.

1416
01:44:30,306 --> 01:44:38,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a nice compliment, certainly, to the listeners and the fact that the show has grown and we're very thankful for that.

1417
01:44:38,710 --> 01:44:41,751
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually could not afford to do this show on Life 365 anymore.

1418
01:44:42,231 --> 01:44:43,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So, don't worry.

1419
01:44:43,352 --> 01:44:44,072
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not happening.

1420
01:44:44,112 --> 01:44:45,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just making a bad joke.

1421
01:44:45,493 --> 01:44:45,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Sheesh.

1422
01:44:48,716 --> 01:45:00,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so what's kind of surprising is, um, to go off completely off topic from that, uh, Blizzard apparently is not going to be including, um, land support, of course, with, um,

1423
01:45:02,490 --> 01:45:04,131
[SPEAKER_03]: StarCraft 2 Land Parties Land Party Centers

1424
01:45:25,327 --> 01:45:29,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, they still have play over their Battle.net stuff, but I mean, it's not the same.

1425
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:33,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can still have a LAN party, it's just that you're all going to have to have an internet connection.

1426
01:45:34,493 --> 01:45:34,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1427
01:45:34,873 --> 01:45:40,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, in this Wi-Fi day and age, shouldn't be that difficult, but still, it is kind of crappy still.

1428
01:45:40,336 --> 01:45:48,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you think about it, there is more lag, I think, involved with that, because you're not just playing off of a local network, but...

1429
01:45:50,768 --> 01:45:51,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, that kind of sucks.

1430
01:45:52,029 --> 01:45:57,374
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, Blizzard's responding to the whole removal of it because everyone was pissed off.

1431
01:45:58,275 --> 01:46:08,824
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't currently plan to support land play in StarCraft 2 as we are building Battle.net to be the ideal destination for multiplayer gaming with StarCraft 2 and future Blizzard Entertainment Games.

1432
01:46:08,964 --> 01:46:17,852
[SPEAKER_03]: While this was a difficult decision for us, we felt that moving away from land play and directing players to our upgraded Battle.net service was the best option to ensure that

1433
01:46:18,172 --> 01:46:22,136
[SPEAKER_03]: A quality multiplayer experience with StarCraft 2 and safeguard against piracy.

1434
01:46:24,819 --> 01:46:29,584
[SPEAKER_05]: SG100Mad in chat says, Hell, I'm having a party next week and we intend on playing Mass StarCraft via LAN.

1435
01:46:32,771 --> 01:46:33,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, though.

1436
01:46:34,111 --> 01:46:39,134
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you can't still get everyone in a room together and play this game together.

1437
01:46:39,634 --> 01:46:42,756
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to do it on the internet, which I know kind of sucks because it's different.

1438
01:46:42,796 --> 01:46:45,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And they want to do that so that it validates your copy.

1439
01:46:45,798 --> 01:46:46,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1440
01:46:47,098 --> 01:46:47,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's piracy.

1441
01:46:48,059 --> 01:46:48,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're trying to curb piracy.

1442
01:46:48,939 --> 01:46:55,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone's going to create a client that's going to act like Battle.net that you'll connect to that and you'll be able to play LAN with.

1443
01:46:55,843 --> 01:46:56,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess who will be doing that?

1444
01:46:56,964 --> 01:46:59,305
[SPEAKER_03]: The pirates because they'll figure out a way around this.

1445
01:47:00,067 --> 01:47:00,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of agree.

1446
01:47:00,867 --> 01:47:02,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard ought to know better than this.

1447
01:47:03,769 --> 01:47:06,450
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to take it out and someone's going to find a way to put it back in.

1448
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:07,270
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1449
01:47:08,571 --> 01:47:12,712
[SPEAKER_05]: They might as well just put it in there and just encourage people to buy the game legitimately.

1450
01:47:15,086 --> 01:47:19,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Have one computer on the land sneak onto the internet and see if the other copies are validated.

1451
01:47:20,030 --> 01:47:21,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly there's a way this could be done.

1452
01:47:21,992 --> 01:47:26,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, like, if one computer, like, creeps onto the internet, Battle.net could somehow kind of tell.

1453
01:47:27,076 --> 01:47:27,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1454
01:47:27,777 --> 01:47:28,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm just crazy.

1455
01:47:28,557 --> 01:47:32,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, you know, everyone's pissed off, and what happens when people get pissed off?

1456
01:47:32,761 --> 01:47:34,002
[SPEAKER_03]: They start a petition.

1457
01:47:35,023 --> 01:47:37,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they have a petition created, um...

1458
01:47:38,066 --> 01:47:38,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1459
01:48:07,918 --> 01:48:26,220
[SPEAKER_05]: because we did next question no they'll say blah blah blah well we think the marketplace is shifting and we just wanted to encourage folks to use Battle.net so that they could track their achievements and everything is statistic based and if we do the land then we can't have that you're going to get some talk around answer just wait yeah just wait

1460
01:48:27,874 --> 01:48:54,240
[SPEAKER_03]: um let's talk a little bit about the Dreamcast yes Dreamcast is of course getting yet another game and much like the other you know new games for the Dreamcast that have been coming out recently is another shmup game uh the brand new 2D um shoot em up game named Dux D-U-X and it's actually um being sold I guess um right now for $27.90 um

1461
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:58,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it's going to be a disc-based game or not.

1462
01:48:58,682 --> 01:49:03,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it could be, since, you know, Dreamcast can pretty much read any sort of burned disc.

1463
01:49:05,466 --> 01:49:23,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, I guess, they have another game that's also coming out as well, the company Hucast, and it's... I guess the title is Last Hope Pink Bullets, which I guess was co-developed by The Shins.

1464
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:24,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1465
01:49:25,601 --> 01:49:25,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Which...

1466
01:49:27,492 --> 01:49:56,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I've not heard of any of these things apparently that's actually like the shins like the band the shins huh interesting incredibly but yeah I mean it's still nice to see I guess games coming out for the Dreamcast pretty cool alright well you know what guys I think it's time to get into the FUs of the week we wouldn't want to forget it this week so we gotta get into the FUs of the week and of course the story that inspires our angst this week

1467
01:50:12,418 --> 01:50:12,858
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1468
01:50:36,345 --> 01:50:43,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So they stole this thing from the neighbor and then the parents, or the mom, I shouldn't say parents, the mom helped them sell it off at a local pawn shop.

1469
01:50:44,053 --> 01:50:47,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It was being reported by WFTB in Orlando.

1470
01:50:47,477 --> 01:50:53,023
[SPEAKER_05]: The Maxine Law will probably be charged with dealing in stolen property and contributing to the delinquency of minors.

1471
01:50:54,284 --> 01:50:55,926
[SPEAKER_05]: You should know better, you stupid.

1472
01:50:57,067 --> 01:50:57,908
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me angry.

1473
01:50:57,988 --> 01:50:58,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, FU's the week.

1474
01:50:59,897 --> 01:51:06,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess FU to not having enough time to play games and being broke, more or less.

1475
01:51:10,025 --> 01:51:11,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a lot of FUs this week.

1476
01:51:11,667 --> 01:51:21,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm generally feeling pretty good, so I guess I would just also give an FU to not having enough hours in the day to play video games and FU to Facebook games for being so stupidly addicting.

1477
01:51:25,658 --> 01:51:25,898
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1478
01:51:26,348 --> 01:51:27,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

1479
01:51:27,869 --> 01:51:29,129
[SPEAKER_05]: We got release dates to get to, too.

1480
01:51:29,149 --> 01:51:30,990
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to those in a little bit after another couple stories.

1481
01:51:31,110 --> 01:51:32,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some free games.

1482
01:51:33,051 --> 01:51:33,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, free!

1483
01:51:33,731 --> 01:51:34,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, free is good.

1484
01:51:35,132 --> 01:51:36,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are actually some pretty good free games.

1485
01:51:36,833 --> 01:51:38,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Both happen to be fighting games.

1486
01:51:39,194 --> 01:51:42,395
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is a game called Vanguard Princess.

1487
01:51:43,215 --> 01:51:48,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it's a 2D freeware fighter game developed by...

1488
01:51:49,398 --> 01:51:50,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1489
01:52:06,365 --> 01:52:06,865
[SPEAKER_03]: www.vector.co.jp

1490
01:52:24,186 --> 01:52:34,191
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkPresence is a digitized fighting game very similar to the old Mortal Kombat games.

1491
01:52:35,172 --> 01:52:39,894
[SPEAKER_05]: So like Street Fighter, the movie, the game, where they actually captured the faces of people?

1492
01:52:39,934 --> 01:52:41,235
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making a new game like this?

1493
01:52:41,535 --> 01:52:41,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1494
01:52:41,815 --> 01:52:42,976
[SPEAKER_05]: That is freaking awesome.

1495
01:52:43,276 --> 01:52:44,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, I take that back.

1496
01:52:44,596 --> 01:52:48,679
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a free game, but apparently...

1497
01:52:50,384 --> 01:52:51,485
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a new arcade game, isn't it?

1498
01:52:57,881 --> 01:52:59,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Crappy, if it's an arcade game, I don't know.

1499
01:53:00,222 --> 01:53:13,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was reading something about it's got more animation, I guess, than any game like it has ever existed, so it's supposed to be a smoother looking game than the Mortal Kombat games were, which I would hope, being that it's been many years, the technology hopefully has gotten a little better.

1500
01:53:13,126 --> 01:53:25,190
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it looks like one of those cheesy games that you would see in a movie or something like that when they're trying to create a game in the movie that's supposed to represent a Mortal Kombat type-ish game, something really low budget.

1501
01:53:26,257 --> 01:53:27,238
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, whatever.

1502
01:53:27,498 --> 01:53:36,022
[SPEAKER_03]: If it comes out and turns out to be cool, hey, Mortal Kombat at the time, I think it looks sort of cheesy on a certain level, so more power to him.

1503
01:53:37,743 --> 01:53:38,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1504
01:53:38,715 --> 01:53:40,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into the release dates, shall we?

1505
01:53:40,155 --> 01:53:43,436
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to travel around the world now and talk about what is coming out around the world.

1506
01:53:44,136 --> 01:53:47,257
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start tonight with Japan since those are the release dates I have up right now.

1507
01:53:47,957 --> 01:53:59,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out in Japan on July the 9th, Major League Baseball 2009 comes to the Xbox 360 as well as WWE Legends of WrestleMania also making its way to the 360 this coming week on July the 9th.

1508
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:10,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Siren gets a price drop into PlayStation 3's best series, as well as WWE Legends of WrestleMania also comes out on July the 9th.

1509
01:54:10,825 --> 01:54:16,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to some other systems, we have on the Nintendo Wii, I believe, is next.

1510
01:54:17,427 --> 01:54:19,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing really coming out this week in Japan.

1511
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:26,071
[SPEAKER_05]: The next big release, Dragon Ball game coming out July 23rd, but it's a little quiet for Wii games right now, which is a little strange.

1512
01:54:26,752 --> 01:54:27,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually they're still pretty busy.

1513
01:54:28,152 --> 01:54:31,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Major League Baseball 2009 also makes its way to the PlayStation 2 this week.

1514
01:54:31,954 --> 01:54:35,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of not surprised, though, that a baseball release would be kind of the big thing in Japan this week.

1515
01:54:36,757 --> 01:54:40,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You get some new peripherals for the DS, some Disney character headphones coming out.

1516
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:49,245
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise, there's really not a lot of new games coming out, but there is a price drop coming out on Hamster 2 Kuroso comes out.

1517
01:54:49,765 --> 01:54:50,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, it doesn't come out.

1518
01:54:50,466 --> 01:54:55,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets a price drop this week, which is this happy hamster-looking game.

1519
01:54:56,110 --> 01:54:57,951
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks like Nintendogs, but it's hamsters.

1520
01:54:57,971 --> 01:54:58,972
[SPEAKER_05]: They do look very cute, though.

1521
01:55:00,314 --> 01:55:00,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Aww.

1522
01:55:01,295 --> 01:55:02,716
[SPEAKER_05]: No sign of Richard Gere in the game, by the way.

1523
01:55:03,617 --> 01:55:05,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And then let's see on the PSP.

1524
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Bleach gets a price reduction.

1525
01:55:08,442 --> 01:55:08,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Heat the Soul 5.

1526
01:55:10,204 --> 01:55:12,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Another port of Major League Baseball 2009 this week.

1527
01:55:13,307 --> 01:55:18,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, looks like this is a big week for baseball in Japan, but otherwise, nothing else to really note.

1528
01:55:19,509 --> 01:55:20,030
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the US?

1529
01:55:20,850 --> 01:55:23,532
[SPEAKER_03]: US, there isn't really a lot of stuff coming out this week.

1530
01:55:24,553 --> 01:55:32,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much your big release is going to be the Bigs 2, which is coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and I believe the PSP.

1531
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:42,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Also this week, we've got, looks like, oh, the, this is a crappy game here.

1532
01:55:44,527 --> 01:55:44,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

1533
01:55:44,707 --> 01:55:44,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

1534
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:48,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see that on there.

1535
01:55:49,021 --> 01:55:54,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Birthday Party Bash on the Wii, which, you know, apparently it's a birthday party kit in a box.

1536
01:55:56,252 --> 01:55:58,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you're a mom, maybe that might be interesting for you.

1537
01:55:59,256 --> 01:56:01,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw little birthday parties for your kids.

1538
01:56:02,161 --> 01:56:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1539
01:56:03,883 --> 01:56:15,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Also this week we've got a port of a game that came out in the UK, Sid the Dummy, which is a Crash Dummy game, something that would have probably been popular like 20 years ago.

1540
01:56:17,113 --> 01:56:19,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on PSP, PS2, and the Wii.

1541
01:56:19,835 --> 01:56:25,699
[SPEAKER_03]: A re-release of Bioshock and Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, kind of combined together in the bundle for PC and Xbox 360.

1542
01:56:25,739 --> 01:56:32,264
[SPEAKER_03]: The packaged version of Arma 2 coming out on PC, which is supposed to be pretty sweet.

1543
01:56:33,671 --> 01:56:58,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Memento Mori on PC and then coming out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network this week Battlefield 1943 also on WiiWare this week and PC the first chapter of the new Tales of Monkey Island series Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 1 Launch of the Screaming Narwhal which sounds pretty cool and um

1544
01:57:00,444 --> 01:57:03,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I believe Trine is supposed to be coming out on PS3 as well.

1545
01:57:04,006 --> 01:57:05,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Or on the PlayStation Network this week as well.

1546
01:57:07,127 --> 01:57:08,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So not really a huge, huge week?

1547
01:57:10,068 --> 01:57:10,908
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.

1548
01:57:11,789 --> 01:57:15,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week... I mean, July is really slow for game releases.

1549
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:17,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I think next week we've got NCAA Football 2010.

1550
01:57:18,912 --> 01:57:20,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're into college football, that would be good for you.

1551
01:57:21,013 --> 01:57:23,854
[SPEAKER_03]: But really not a lot of big stuff.

1552
01:57:23,914 --> 01:57:25,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at the end of the month, of course, King of Fire is 12.

1553
01:57:25,595 --> 01:57:26,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be cool.

1554
01:57:26,855 --> 01:57:28,776
[SPEAKER_05]: This time of year is usually a little slow, isn't it?

1555
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:30,436
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always slow this time of year

1556
01:57:58,807 --> 01:57:59,207
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1557
01:58:00,088 --> 01:58:07,213
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more stories, then we'll open up the Skype line for you guys at 1-877-GAME-OLR to take your calls tonight on anything you want to talk about.

1558
01:58:09,794 --> 01:58:14,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, according to Sesame Street, video games are okay.

1559
01:58:15,638 --> 01:58:16,979
[SPEAKER_05]: According to Sesame Street.

1560
01:58:17,859 --> 01:58:24,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So as opposed to according to Joystick or Destructoid or Kotaku or one of the big game blogs this week, it's according to Sesame Street...

1561
01:58:25,834 --> 01:58:26,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, apparently.

1562
01:58:27,035 --> 01:58:28,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

1563
01:58:28,877 --> 01:58:29,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1564
01:58:29,237 --> 01:58:44,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Game Changer, a report issued by Joan Gans Clooney Center from the Sesame Workshop, basically says that governments, the healthcare industry, and schools should be spending less time hating on video games and their negative efforts.

1565
01:58:46,194 --> 01:59:14,165
[SPEAKER_03]: negative effects and said be conducting research on their positive effects on kids the report says that games not only can be educational but in this day and age active as well meaning they can be used everywhere from a history classroom to a PE class and of course you know they're also saying the Joan Ganz Clooney Center is to foster innovation and children's learning through digital media so that's their kind of did you hear that Jack Voldemort you listening

1566
01:59:16,318 --> 01:59:18,960
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah, that's kind of neat.

1567
01:59:19,341 --> 01:59:21,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we get a song about it that Elmo sings.

1568
01:59:22,503 --> 01:59:25,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games are A-OK.

1569
01:59:26,406 --> 01:59:28,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do your homework then you can play.

1570
01:59:30,269 --> 01:59:34,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully Elmo will never have to explain to children what teabagging is in Halo.

1571
01:59:38,055 --> 01:59:45,182
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some contest there in there that I want to do about who can write the best Sesame Street song for something obscene in gaming.

1572
01:59:46,983 --> 01:59:47,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1573
01:59:49,346 --> 01:59:49,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

1574
01:59:50,447 --> 01:59:53,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Gold Anthro in chat says, Another reason that Sesame Street is awesome.

1575
01:59:53,209 --> 01:59:54,971
[SPEAKER_05]: First the death episode and now video games.

1576
01:59:54,991 --> 01:59:56,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of talking about something we talked about last week.

1577
01:59:59,059 --> 02:00:04,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, by the way, speaking of media, I don't know if you guys heard about this, but apparently they want to make a movie out of Asteroids.

1578
02:00:04,802 --> 02:00:05,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop!

1579
02:00:05,803 --> 02:00:12,046
[SPEAKER_05]: The old-ass fucking game from 1979 that many of you know from the Atari 2600, Asteroids.

1580
02:00:12,486 --> 02:00:15,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Universal has somehow gotten the rights to make Asteroids.

1581
02:00:16,669 --> 02:00:18,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Matthew Lopez is writing the script.

1582
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:23,072
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being produced by Lorenzo de Bonaventura, who I know produced some other stuff.

1583
02:00:24,032 --> 02:00:24,973
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the weird thing.

1584
02:00:25,053 --> 02:00:25,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently...

1585
02:00:27,415 --> 02:00:30,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Universal is making a lot of movies of some weird shit right now.

1586
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:35,505
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the rights to some Hasbro games like Battleship and Candyland are supposed to be coming movies as well.

1587
02:00:36,758 --> 02:00:38,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they picked up a lot of Hasbro stuff.

1588
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:41,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know where I've heard Lorenzo de Bonaventura before?

1589
02:00:42,122 --> 02:00:43,083
[SPEAKER_05]: He's producing that G.I.

1590
02:00:43,123 --> 02:00:45,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe movie that's coming out next month.

1591
02:00:45,104 --> 02:00:46,145
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty big movie.

1592
02:00:46,425 --> 02:00:48,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like these are no-name people behind this.

1593
02:00:48,486 --> 02:00:51,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a pretty big movie, but it's also going to be a pretty big flop.

1594
02:00:51,909 --> 02:00:52,709
[SPEAKER_05]: You think so, huh?

1595
02:00:52,789 --> 02:00:58,854
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, Transformers has a lot of horrible things going for it, and it still did very well.

1596
02:00:58,894 --> 02:00:59,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So who knows?

1597
02:01:00,135 --> 02:01:00,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1598
02:01:01,684 --> 02:01:02,685
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1599
02:01:18,298 --> 02:01:19,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is the movie in the game?

1600
02:01:19,918 --> 02:01:22,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's not even going to have a damn thing to do with the game.

1601
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:24,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a space movie called Asteroids.

1602
02:01:24,999 --> 02:01:26,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoop-de-doo.

1603
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:31,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I shot the asteroid and it turned into two smaller asteroids.

1604
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:32,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.

1605
02:01:33,781 --> 02:01:35,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick, shoot the UFO for bonus points.

1606
02:01:35,741 --> 02:01:37,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be funnier for the space invaders.

1607
02:01:38,162 --> 02:01:40,362
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw on chat says there's already an Asteroids movie.

1608
02:01:40,422 --> 02:01:42,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Armageddon.

1609
02:01:42,763 --> 02:01:44,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Armageddon is actually like 10 years old now, believe it or not.

1610
02:01:45,674 --> 02:01:46,615
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of an old movie now.

1611
02:01:47,035 --> 02:01:48,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for an update.

1612
02:01:48,236 --> 02:01:50,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Blow up the asteroid to make it multiple asteroids.

1613
02:01:51,398 --> 02:01:51,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

1614
02:01:52,238 --> 02:01:55,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Please no dancing animal crackers in the Asteroids movie.

1615
02:01:55,620 --> 02:01:56,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

1616
02:01:56,921 --> 02:01:57,622
[SPEAKER_05]: No Ben Affleck.

1617
02:01:57,842 --> 02:02:00,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1618
02:02:00,844 --> 02:02:01,724
[SPEAKER_05]: How many more stories do we have?

1619
02:02:01,764 --> 02:02:03,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one more for the Skype line?

1620
02:02:03,205 --> 02:02:03,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Two more?

1621
02:02:03,665 --> 02:02:03,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1622
02:02:05,026 --> 02:02:06,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do one more.

1623
02:02:06,647 --> 02:02:09,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll open up the Skype line if you want to fill time with other stories we can.

1624
02:02:09,743 --> 02:02:11,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's see.

1625
02:02:13,704 --> 02:02:18,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not really sad about this, but apparently Neterozy is being shut down.

1626
02:02:19,346 --> 02:02:22,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony is pulling the plug on the PlayStation 1 development community.

1627
02:02:23,467 --> 02:02:27,729
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to still keep all the libraries and stuff online, but I guess it's officially shut down.

1628
02:02:27,769 --> 02:02:28,469
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly...

1629
02:02:29,229 --> 02:02:30,090
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1630
02:02:49,269 --> 02:02:50,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

1631
02:02:50,889 --> 02:02:54,510
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the guy on the east coast with the fastest trigger, Ranma Hi Ranma, how are you doing?

1632
02:03:18,377 --> 02:03:19,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty good, pretty good.

1633
02:03:19,718 --> 02:03:20,858
[SPEAKER_05]: What cons did you go to this week?

1634
02:03:23,499 --> 02:03:26,441
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said to Tiger Claw, I didn't go to any conventions this week.

1635
02:03:26,561 --> 02:03:28,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I only do the ones that are on the East Coast.

1636
02:03:29,242 --> 02:03:29,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

1637
02:03:29,622 --> 02:03:32,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, Anime Expo is the big deal on the West Coast this week.

1638
02:03:32,383 --> 02:03:34,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, I should say something about this.

1639
02:03:34,984 --> 02:03:42,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Our staffer, DJ Tyrant, Jimmy, who used to host a show on our old network with DMN.

1640
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:43,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Brest Lowell now.

1641
02:03:43,808 --> 02:03:45,869
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to host a show together called STFU.

1642
02:03:45,929 --> 02:03:47,490
[SPEAKER_05]: He writes for our website once in a while now.

1643
02:03:48,150 --> 02:03:49,851
[SPEAKER_05]: AX is not a con, it's a trade show

1644
02:04:17,085 --> 02:04:21,168
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1645
02:04:39,471 --> 02:04:41,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not fan produced.

1646
02:04:41,512 --> 02:04:42,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

1647
02:04:42,152 --> 02:04:45,293
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why Fanime always kind of puts that big fan.

1648
02:04:45,693 --> 02:04:50,215
[SPEAKER_05]: They really sell their thing on fan made, fan produced for the past so many years.

1649
02:04:50,595 --> 02:04:54,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most cons I've gone to, especially ones I've staffed, are mostly fan based.

1650
02:04:55,277 --> 02:04:55,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1651
02:04:55,557 --> 02:04:56,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's cool.

1652
02:04:59,399 --> 02:05:00,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1653
02:05:00,339 --> 02:05:04,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I would say all the good cons are fan based, but E3 is pretty awesome for a trade show.

1654
02:05:04,901 --> 02:05:05,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So trade shows aren't all bad.

1655
02:05:06,181 --> 02:05:06,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, sorry.

1656
02:05:06,642 --> 02:05:06,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

1657
02:05:07,947 --> 02:05:09,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, what else did you want to call in about tonight?

1658
02:05:36,704 --> 02:05:38,827
[SPEAKER_02]: But people bought it because the name IBM was on it.

1659
02:05:39,107 --> 02:05:42,451
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only difference was, at the time, IBM made a good quality product.

1660
02:05:42,912 --> 02:05:43,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony, not so much.

1661
02:05:44,234 --> 02:05:45,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony is not Apple.

1662
02:05:45,635 --> 02:05:46,697
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to realize that.

1663
02:05:47,618 --> 02:05:48,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple can get away with that.

1664
02:05:48,699 --> 02:05:49,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony can't.

1665
02:05:51,255 --> 02:06:18,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I know because I don't know if you ever noticed if you ever pick up like the Best Buy flyers or when Circuit City was still around in their flyers they're always pushing the PS3s with the Sony televisions if you bought the Sony TV and the PS3 $200 instant savings or if you bought that with Rock Band or Guitar Hero World Tour you save $300 off the complete bundle it's gotten to the point where

1666
02:06:19,409 --> 02:06:21,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony cannot sell the PS3 anymore.

1667
02:06:21,732 --> 02:06:24,916
[SPEAKER_02]: In order for them to push them out, they gotta bundle it with something, you know?

1668
02:06:26,116 --> 02:06:52,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm reading some interesting comments from chatroom chat.orangelaunchery.com Jrod in chat says I plan on buying a PSP Go on day one that thing looks pimp as hell don't get me wrong, I think the PSP Go looks pretty cool, but since I already have a PSP, there's just not enough in it for me, I don't know, I'm not feeling it for 200, I would be all over that fucking thing if it was like 150 even even 150, same price as the current PSP, I would be all over it but it's that 250 it's, ah, I can't do it, I'm sorry

1669
02:06:57,586 --> 02:06:57,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1670
02:06:58,487 --> 02:06:59,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't blame you.

1671
02:06:59,187 --> 02:06:59,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I don't.

1672
02:07:00,928 --> 02:07:02,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you're a Sony hater.

1673
02:07:02,169 --> 02:07:02,669
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

1674
02:07:03,649 --> 02:07:04,670
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just speak the truth.

1675
02:07:04,730 --> 02:07:05,230
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that.

1676
02:07:05,550 --> 02:07:06,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look.

1677
02:07:06,050 --> 02:07:07,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else before I let you go and get some more callers?

1678
02:07:08,552 --> 02:07:09,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Two quick things.

1679
02:07:09,252 --> 02:07:14,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, if the Wii wasn't all about motion control, it would have a shit ton of shovelware games on it.

1680
02:07:14,715 --> 02:07:18,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And as for StarCraft 2, you don't need... It does have a shit ton of shovelware games on it.

1681
02:07:18,836 --> 02:07:19,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Where have you been?

1682
02:07:20,456 --> 02:07:21,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was the other thing?

1683
02:07:41,963 --> 02:07:44,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about StarCraft 2 not needing LAN support.

1684
02:07:44,545 --> 02:07:51,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cost that much to put in an internet connection, a router, and a 24-port switch to get everybody up and running together.

1685
02:07:53,013 --> 02:07:55,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's really going to have that same feeling, though?

1686
02:07:57,296 --> 02:08:01,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if they do it where you log in via the application, it shouldn't be that much of an issue.

1687
02:08:02,401 --> 02:08:05,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you'll probably have the same lag time as if you're in the same room, you know?

1688
02:08:06,304 --> 02:08:08,606
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends on who's hosting and all that crap, you know?

1689
02:08:09,372 --> 02:08:09,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

1690
02:08:10,233 --> 02:08:10,653
[SPEAKER_05]: True, true.

1691
02:08:11,193 --> 02:08:12,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well thanks for your thoughts, Ranma.

1692
02:08:12,854 --> 02:08:13,235
[SPEAKER_05]: And good luck.

1693
02:08:13,895 --> 02:08:14,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1694
02:08:15,916 --> 02:08:18,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Jrod, I wanted to clarify what he was saying earlier.

1695
02:08:18,738 --> 02:08:21,760
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, I don't own a PSP, so that's why it's probably so attractive to me.

1696
02:08:22,241 --> 02:08:27,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd probably be a little more about the PSP if I didn't already own one.

1697
02:08:27,945 --> 02:08:28,425
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, $250?

1698
02:08:28,885 --> 02:08:30,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1699
02:08:31,627 --> 02:08:32,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1700
02:08:32,548 --> 02:08:32,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1701
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:36,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1702
02:08:37,111 --> 02:08:37,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1703
02:08:37,391 --> 02:08:37,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1704
02:08:39,835 --> 02:08:40,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, who's this?

1705
02:08:41,116 --> 02:08:43,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, who is this?

1706
02:08:45,478 --> 02:08:46,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this Marissa?

1707
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:49,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, what's on your mind, Marissa?

1708
02:08:51,582 --> 02:08:52,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, things are good.

1709
02:08:52,542 --> 02:08:56,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had to say a belated congrats for last week.

1710
02:08:57,125 --> 02:08:59,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't able to listen in, although I heard it was a good show.

1711
02:09:00,515 --> 02:09:01,435
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a pretty good show.

1712
02:09:01,475 --> 02:09:09,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It sadly hasn't hit the podcast feed because I'm a lazy son of a bitch, but it will be hitting it very soon, and you guys can hear it was a little bit of a throwback to the old days.

1713
02:09:09,438 --> 02:09:09,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool.

1714
02:09:11,739 --> 02:09:20,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know, as far as my own gaming week, this Fourth of July weekend consisted of watching Chris play Call of Duty.

1715
02:09:22,702 --> 02:09:23,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And how was that?

1716
02:09:23,662 --> 02:09:25,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it fun to watch his play?

1717
02:09:29,292 --> 02:09:30,393
[SPEAKER_08]: All the sounds of murder just make me tired.

1718
02:09:30,413 --> 02:09:33,816
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I've actually distracted myself with that old, you know, you're talking about people doing

1719
02:09:50,117 --> 02:10:16,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Making games for Dreamcast and whatnot and old systems I distracted myself with that old adventure game engine And was playing that Alien Rape game Oh yeah, the one you linked me to That looked kind of freaky deaky But tell us a little bit about this game Yeah, actually I didn't get into it But I thought it was hilarious Like Alien Rape Escape or something Because you know me, I love all the old adventure games How do you feel about the new Monkey Island game coming out?

1720
02:10:18,406 --> 02:10:19,227
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1721
02:10:38,288 --> 02:10:41,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still obsessing over the announcement that we made that a new feast is going to come out.

1722
02:10:41,691 --> 02:10:43,632
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have this praying every night that Eidos doesn't fuck it up.

1723
02:11:05,990 --> 02:11:08,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that how it always goes with old franchises, though?

1724
02:11:08,411 --> 02:11:11,714
[SPEAKER_05]: When they announce that there's a new one coming out, you just pray that they're not going to fuck it up?

1725
02:11:13,695 --> 02:11:23,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, I guess the thing is, when I first took over for Looking Glass, although I actually liked the platform game, the Xbox game, Deadly Shadows, most of the purists didn't like it.

1726
02:11:24,442 --> 02:11:31,527
[SPEAKER_08]: And it started out kind of lame because they called it Thief with a 4 instead of the I or something.

1727
02:11:31,587 --> 02:11:32,848
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sort of lame like that.

1728
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:35,722
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like Thor for something now.

1729
02:11:35,762 --> 02:11:39,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how to pronounce it, but I guess it's just a working title.

1730
02:11:40,525 --> 02:11:40,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed.

1731
02:11:41,326 --> 02:11:45,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Marissa, you need to come visit us soon and come be on the show again.

1732
02:11:46,090 --> 02:11:46,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that'll happen.

1733
02:11:47,891 --> 02:11:50,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight before we get to some more calls?

1734
02:11:52,995 --> 02:11:55,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing that wouldn't be so blindly silly.

1735
02:11:55,898 --> 02:12:01,122
[SPEAKER_08]: So have a good night, and hopefully I'll be seeing you soon, and you need to call so-and-so.

1736
02:12:01,362 --> 02:12:01,642
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1737
02:12:01,682 --> 02:12:02,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Will do, honey.

1738
02:12:03,638 --> 02:12:08,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator, what's on your mind tonight?

1739
02:12:32,525 --> 02:12:35,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Two things which are kind of interrelated to some degree.

1740
02:12:36,266 --> 02:12:38,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

1741
02:12:38,387 --> 02:12:48,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking about the comment you were making about someone's making an Asteroids movie.

1742
02:12:48,911 --> 02:12:49,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1743
02:12:49,211 --> 02:12:53,732
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is, how the hell do you make a movie on Asteroids?

1744
02:12:53,772 --> 02:12:55,333
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like no narrative there.

1745
02:12:56,293 --> 02:13:00,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I can see a movie being made of like

1746
02:13:01,838 --> 02:13:29,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncharted or Metal Gear Solid there's a narrative there but easy the same way the same way dude they're making movies out of Battleship and Candyland they are movies in name only or Pirates of the Caribbean there was really no plot to it you know in the ride but they managed to make three movies and they actually were pretty good now Asteroid could be something similar where they just make up characters and then now those characters are associated with that franchise so

1747
02:13:29,321 --> 02:13:57,237
[SPEAKER_05]: and maybe that's what they want to do maybe it's a type of agreement where if they do a good movie then they can re-release the asteroid game with the characters in it just like they ended up going back and putting the characters in the ride or more importantly had huge amounts of merchandising with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies Jack Sparrow figures still sell like crazy and you see tons of them at Halloween he's a universally loved character I guess that's a good point I didn't even think about if they do write the movie well enough

1748
02:13:57,597 --> 02:13:58,378
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1749
02:14:20,558 --> 02:14:32,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes, it's nice to have a very thin narrative, but I wouldn't, you know, my expectations for this movie are not going to be, I guess, that high because of the fact there's no narrative to base it off of, if that makes sense.

1750
02:14:33,006 --> 02:14:33,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1751
02:14:34,967 --> 02:14:39,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it could very well be good, you know, for all I know.

1752
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:48,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, I haven't seen it, so I can't be sure, but, you know, I'm going to be a little skeptical, you know, to say the least.

1753
02:14:48,513 --> 02:14:50,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we should be skeptical.

1754
02:14:50,213 --> 02:14:52,534
[SPEAKER_05]: It's $10.25 of our money we're going to be spending on the movies.

1755
02:14:53,454 --> 02:14:55,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, what was the other thing you wanted to mention tonight?

1756
02:14:56,835 --> 02:15:17,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I forgot to mention it in my email because I can't really mention it or wrote it, but I happened to notice earlier this week that on the PlayStation Network store, they always have the video side, they got a reasonably new, or new for the store,

1757
02:15:18,424 --> 02:15:22,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Enemy series that may be appealing to some of the listeners out there.

1758
02:15:22,546 --> 02:15:25,867
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Devil May Cry series.

1759
02:15:28,328 --> 02:15:35,810
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, I bought the first episode to try it out, and from what I'm seeing, it looks pretty good.

1760
02:15:36,971 --> 02:15:43,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about the entire series as a whole, but just based on the first episode, it looks pretty good, so...

1761
02:15:45,188 --> 02:15:52,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if any of the listeners want to check it out, or you guys, but at least the first ones are worth checking out.

1762
02:15:52,812 --> 02:15:53,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's cool.

1763
02:16:12,255 --> 02:16:22,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I mentioned in a previous email going back several weeks ago that I had recommended the Burst Angel anime series.

1764
02:16:22,943 --> 02:16:29,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I happen to have all 24 episodes and at least that series is very good.

1765
02:16:30,088 --> 02:16:32,430
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard to describe.

1766
02:16:32,570 --> 02:16:38,114
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a cross between certain elements of X-Files and

1767
02:16:38,795 --> 02:16:41,497
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of Charlie's Angels mixed in.

1768
02:16:41,698 --> 02:16:42,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, Charlie's Angels.

1769
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:46,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of odd, but in a good way.

1770
02:16:47,663 --> 02:16:49,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely worth checking out.

1771
02:16:49,965 --> 02:16:51,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that available on Sony's Marketplace?

1772
02:16:53,208 --> 02:16:54,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.

1773
02:16:56,991 --> 02:17:05,979
[SPEAKER_07]: It's put up, I think, I can't remember the name of the developer, but

1774
02:17:07,307 --> 02:17:12,110
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Funimation, that's for sure, but it's pretty good.

1775
02:17:12,391 --> 02:17:15,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I will definitely have to check that out on the marketplace at some point.

1776
02:17:15,193 --> 02:17:16,694
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you so much for the call, Spazinator.

1777
02:17:16,814 --> 02:17:17,374
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a good one.

1778
02:17:17,394 --> 02:17:18,355
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to get some more calls.

1779
02:17:18,795 --> 02:17:19,556
[SPEAKER_05]: But you take care.

1780
02:17:21,057 --> 02:17:21,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, you too.

1781
02:17:21,697 --> 02:17:22,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

1782
02:17:22,758 --> 02:17:25,820
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1783
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:28,362
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to give us a call, take maybe one more call tonight.

1784
02:17:28,382 --> 02:17:32,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Loki has any other stories he wants to get out there before we take our last call.

1785
02:17:33,205 --> 02:17:33,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1786
02:17:35,566 --> 02:17:35,987
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a call.

1787
02:17:36,007 --> 02:17:36,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1788
02:17:36,967 --> 02:17:37,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1789
02:17:38,829 --> 02:17:39,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is X-Link.

1790
02:17:40,190 --> 02:17:40,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, X-Link.

1791
02:17:40,810 --> 02:17:41,450
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1792
02:17:42,051 --> 02:17:44,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I have a quick question for you guys.

1793
02:17:44,633 --> 02:17:55,820
[SPEAKER_00]: How can a developer bring out a PC version of a game that's really great and really good but yet have so many buggy and radical issues it's not even funny to even start to mention how many stuff there is wrong with the game?

1794
02:17:56,060 --> 02:17:58,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying it's a PC game that came out?

1795
02:17:58,587 --> 02:18:00,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ghostbusters, a video game.

1796
02:18:00,228 --> 02:18:03,129
[SPEAKER_00]: The PC version is absolutely horrid.

1797
02:18:03,449 --> 02:18:13,793
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not, I mean, there's so many complaints from so many people, they're not even issuing any patches, or they're not issuing any kind of, you know, saying, hey, look, we're sorry, we're trying to get on this.

1798
02:18:14,373 --> 02:18:18,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Super duper easy answer for you.

1799
02:18:18,636 --> 02:18:30,865
[SPEAKER_05]: The one kind of problem that I suppose that PC games have in general is that there is not the same quality control that you have on the PlayStation or the Microsoft system or even the Nintendo system.

1800
02:18:31,105 --> 02:18:34,267
[SPEAKER_05]: These games go through no quality control.

1801
02:18:35,468 --> 02:18:39,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember way back when they used to have the Nintendo seal of quality?

1802
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:41,451
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1803
02:19:02,546 --> 02:19:03,346
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on and so forth.

1804
02:19:26,738 --> 02:19:30,219
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to make sure everything is referred to by the proper name for it.

1805
02:19:30,259 --> 02:19:32,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's down to that kind of level of control.

1806
02:19:32,499 --> 02:19:34,840
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PC, who's there to control those games?

1807
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:38,961
[SPEAKER_05]: What third-party entity has to look at those games and review them?

1808
02:19:39,201 --> 02:19:39,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody.

1809
02:19:40,321 --> 02:19:41,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's really watching that.

1810
02:19:41,842 --> 02:19:47,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should be more reviewing done, because like I said before, I feel now I'm being kind of gypped out of my money for the game.

1811
02:19:47,803 --> 02:19:51,344
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was literally looking actually forward to playing it on the PC, and it's like...

1812
02:19:52,290 --> 02:20:00,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to go out and find a way of getting it for either the 360 now or the PS3 in full quality to play it until they come out with some kind of patch.

1813
02:20:00,874 --> 02:20:08,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's been more than one instance with more than one person saying, hey, look, there's these kind of problems.

1814
02:20:08,238 --> 02:20:13,961
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running it on a high-end system, and yet it's still running like it's on a 386 computer.

1815
02:20:14,021 --> 02:20:15,902
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, what's going on here?

1816
02:20:16,202 --> 02:20:18,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comment from Xenocore in the chat room.

1817
02:20:18,163 --> 02:20:19,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to kind of run this by you.

1818
02:20:19,904 --> 02:20:21,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching.

1819
02:20:21,106 --> 02:20:21,566
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.

1820
02:20:36,207 --> 02:20:41,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point is that, you know, when on the PlayStation, on the Xbox, at least you have the same hardware.

1821
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:45,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is something to kind of, but you don't know what components are going to go into those PC games.

1822
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:47,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So how can you really audit them?

1823
02:20:47,513 --> 02:20:54,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I always thought that games for Windows was kind of one of those types of things, was a way to have the game's quality controlled.

1824
02:20:54,756 --> 02:20:57,017
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess he brings up a good point.

1825
02:20:57,097 --> 02:20:59,859
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really test every hardware combination out there.

1826
02:21:00,860 --> 02:21:01,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.

1827
02:21:01,781 --> 02:21:02,782
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very true.

1828
02:21:02,822 --> 02:21:06,848
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought it was kind of weird because, like I said, I play Fallout 3 and everyone's perfect.

1829
02:21:07,068 --> 02:21:08,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problems or anything whatsoever.

1830
02:21:08,610 --> 02:21:12,075
[SPEAKER_00]: I play this and it's like the whole thing is getting ready to crash at a given point.

1831
02:21:12,635 --> 02:21:17,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought it was kind of interesting.

1832
02:21:17,201 --> 02:21:17,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I just...

1833
02:21:18,018 --> 02:21:20,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sorry to hear the game runs like crap, X-Link.

1834
02:21:20,581 --> 02:21:24,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I would still continue to pressure the developers professionally.

1835
02:21:24,306 --> 02:21:26,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Write a letter, post on the forums, what have you.

1836
02:21:27,049 --> 02:21:34,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the other people you know that have been having problems with the game to continue to hound them and say you're not going to support them in the future if they don't fix their crap.

1837
02:21:35,549 --> 02:21:36,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Most definitely.

1838
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:36,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.

1839
02:21:37,591 --> 02:21:37,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

1840
02:21:37,971 --> 02:21:39,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck, buddy, and take care, okay?

1841
02:21:39,492 --> 02:21:39,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1842
02:21:40,213 --> 02:21:40,593
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.

1843
02:21:40,693 --> 02:21:40,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.

1844
02:21:41,133 --> 02:21:41,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

1845
02:21:57,648 --> 02:21:58,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Greg DeStefano

1846
02:22:19,495 --> 02:22:33,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can look at the pictures that they have there on www.GregDeStefano.com That's G-R-E-G-D-E-S-T-E-F-A-N-O.com And they've got some pretty interesting pictures.

1847
02:22:35,064 --> 02:22:37,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough, that Icarus guy looks like Shane.

1848
02:22:37,626 --> 02:22:38,346
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of funny.

1849
02:22:39,607 --> 02:22:40,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, let me see.

1850
02:22:41,328 --> 02:22:41,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of.

1851
02:22:41,888 --> 02:22:43,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1852
02:22:45,590 --> 02:22:47,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if Shane took hardcore drugs...

1853
02:22:50,251 --> 02:22:50,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1854
02:22:51,152 --> 02:22:53,114
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Wario's John Goodman?

1855
02:22:53,715 --> 02:22:53,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh?

1856
02:22:54,175 --> 02:22:54,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of?

1857
02:22:54,576 --> 02:22:55,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that I see a little more, yes.

1858
02:22:55,697 --> 02:22:56,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1859
02:22:56,118 --> 02:22:56,618
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1860
02:22:57,119 --> 02:22:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's interesting.

1861
02:22:59,061 --> 02:23:04,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And then other things, there's some cool rumors going on, including...

1862
02:23:06,698 --> 02:23:08,620
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1863
02:23:24,218 --> 02:23:50,952
[SPEAKER_03]: from Ghostbusters so it makes perfect sense that we'll probably be seeing some stuff pretty soon from that probably just costumes though the Hanabi Festival is coming back in Europe and there's actually a pretty good lineup of games coming with that including I saw they had Ogre Battle which is pretty cool Ogre Battle from the Super Nintendo Pulseman from the Sega Mega Drive Bomberman 94 on TurboGrafx-16

1864
02:23:54,577 --> 02:24:16,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Detna Twinbee on also the TurboGrafx Kirby's Dream Land 3 on Super Nintendo Musha on Sega Mega Drive Smash Table Tennis on the NES and Zoda's Revenge Star Tropics 2 all these coming to Virtual Console during the month of July I guess that's kind of neat

1865
02:24:17,225 --> 02:24:17,946
[SPEAKER_03]: StarTropics2

1866
02:24:41,786 --> 02:24:55,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami, I guess, has also confirmed that they're going to be porting over Contra Rebirth for Europe in August and also Driftmania with two I's, also coming to WiiWare as well.

1867
02:24:55,551 --> 02:24:56,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Drift!

1868
02:24:56,912 --> 02:25:01,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Driftmania, I guess, that's how you pronounce that top-down racing game.

1869
02:25:02,778 --> 02:25:03,499
[SPEAKER_03]: TMNT Smash-Up

1870
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:24,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, they're also going to be getting two Rabid characters.

1871
02:25:25,144 --> 02:25:30,931
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is rumored to be dressed up as Sam Fisher from, of course, the Splinter Cell series.

1872
02:25:31,551 --> 02:25:34,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also Rabid dressed up as a cheerleader.

1873
02:25:35,055 --> 02:25:41,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are supposed to be in the all-teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighting game, which is kind of interesting.

1874
02:25:41,823 --> 02:25:43,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Link's Awakening Link's Awakening Link's Awakening

1875
02:26:04,081 --> 02:26:08,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember this coming out and it's like, oh my god, Link's Awakening, we can play it on the TI-83.

1876
02:26:08,544 --> 02:26:09,485
[SPEAKER_05]: But really?

1877
02:26:10,686 --> 02:26:13,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Those little graphing calculators can handle all the processing?

1878
02:26:14,208 --> 02:26:15,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you show me the video?

1879
02:26:15,549 --> 02:26:18,352
[SPEAKER_03]: They can hack them so that it's an assembly and stuff.

1880
02:26:19,993 --> 02:26:24,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's awful sound quality, but the graphics are just, it's okay.

1881
02:26:24,857 --> 02:26:26,117
[SPEAKER_05]: The graphics are kind of crap.

1882
02:26:26,458 --> 02:26:27,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it's a graphing calculator.

1883
02:26:27,519 --> 02:26:30,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's slow, but yeah, it's a graphing calculator running the game.

1884
02:26:30,841 --> 02:26:31,822
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

1885
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:35,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that a lot of the stuff they probably just programmed from scratch.

1886
02:26:35,774 --> 02:26:37,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's actually being emulated.

1887
02:26:37,456 --> 02:26:39,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can't imagine this is any fun to actually play.

1888
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:42,203
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just more of an accomplishment than anything else.

1889
02:26:43,204 --> 02:26:45,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember back in the day it used to be...

1890
02:26:48,228 --> 02:27:00,313
[SPEAKER_03]: This is back when they first started porting assembly stuff to the TI-85 and you can hack the calculator to run faster than it normally could and you could do grayscale games and stuff like that.

1891
02:27:01,093 --> 02:27:01,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, the days.

1892
02:27:01,953 --> 02:27:06,115
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I quit my calculus class because I was too busy programming games.

1893
02:27:06,855 --> 02:27:07,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1894
02:27:07,715 --> 02:27:08,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah.

1895
02:27:11,277 --> 02:27:12,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all I have right now.

1896
02:27:13,818 --> 02:27:14,138
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1897
02:27:14,454 --> 02:27:15,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, we're made it.

1898
02:27:15,615 --> 02:27:16,456
[SPEAKER_05]: We're to the end of the show.

1899
02:27:16,496 --> 02:27:19,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a little earlier than last week, but we're kind of at the end of the show.

1900
02:27:19,879 --> 02:27:25,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's okay, because I don't know about you guys, but after this holiday weekend, I still have some things I'm trying to take care of before I go back to work tomorrow.

1901
02:27:26,465 --> 02:27:28,046
[SPEAKER_05]: After this whole three-day work weekend.

1902
02:27:28,747 --> 02:27:33,291
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we're going to go ahead and wrap things up and get on out of here for the night.

1903
02:27:33,991 --> 02:27:35,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much for listening tonight.

1904
02:27:35,992 --> 02:27:37,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, DarkSakura's not here either.

1905
02:27:37,833 --> 02:27:41,094
[SPEAKER_05]: She'll usually help banter with us for a little while and bring her stories to the table.

1906
02:27:41,114 --> 02:27:44,235
[SPEAKER_05]: She's not here, so I think it's going to be the end of the show, believe it or not.

1907
02:27:44,275 --> 02:27:44,676
[SPEAKER_05]: We're done.

1908
02:27:44,736 --> 02:27:46,196
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out of here.

1909
02:27:46,276 --> 02:27:56,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's good because it gives me a chance to make sure I can get on the network and get the files that I need to upload the show later this week because I don't want the podcast people to have to wait any longer.

1910
02:27:57,677 --> 02:27:59,338
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out of here, believe it or not.

1911
02:27:59,979 --> 02:28:00,339
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1912
02:28:00,679 --> 02:28:01,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great night, everybody.

1913
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:04,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get around to everybody's final thoughts.

1914
02:28:04,162 --> 02:28:04,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

1915
02:28:05,142 --> 02:28:13,488
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I'm watching and someone actually took a DS Lite and they've managed to turn it into an arcade cabinet.

1916
02:28:14,189 --> 02:28:17,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I should say put a DS in an arcade cabinet.

1917
02:28:18,456 --> 02:28:18,956
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

1918
02:28:19,177 --> 02:28:19,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1919
02:28:20,037 --> 02:28:25,302
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is, instead of spending $400 on a laptop, I should have just bought myself an arcade cabinet for my house.

1920
02:28:25,463 --> 02:28:26,123
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been fun.

1921
02:28:26,664 --> 02:28:27,585
[SPEAKER_05]: The room would have loved that.

1922
02:28:29,567 --> 02:28:37,994
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in hindsight, like I said, I think before, I'd rather have bought... See, because we were in an apartment complex, in order to have the whole thing delivered, it comes on a pallet.

1923
02:28:38,095 --> 02:28:41,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you can't deliver a pallet of stuff to an apartment complex.

1924
02:28:42,349 --> 02:28:44,651
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get people looking at you funny.

1925
02:28:45,512 --> 02:28:47,174
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, that would have been the way I would have gone.

1926
02:28:47,194 --> 02:28:52,699
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs like a sixth of what I paid for it and just looks so much nicer.

1927
02:28:54,997 --> 02:28:55,578
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, guys.

1928
02:28:55,598 --> 02:28:57,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for tuning into our show tonight.

1929
02:28:57,619 --> 02:29:00,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for listening to our show and supporting independent podcasting.

1930
02:29:00,741 --> 02:29:03,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, we would not be here without your support.

1931
02:29:04,224 --> 02:29:05,104
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

1932
02:29:05,144 --> 02:29:07,466
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kept us going for seven years and hopefully seven more.

1933
02:29:08,246 --> 02:29:12,669
[SPEAKER_05]: From all of us here at Orange Lounge Radio Studios in Sacramento, California, I hope you all have a great week.

1934
02:29:13,010 --> 02:29:14,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be back next week.

1935
02:29:14,511 --> 02:29:15,672
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura will be back.

1936
02:29:15,792 --> 02:29:16,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be here.

1937
02:29:16,392 --> 02:29:17,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki will be here.

1938
02:29:17,513 --> 02:29:19,814
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll have some fun and talk about next week's worth of news.

1939
02:29:20,135 --> 02:29:20,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you be here?

1940
02:29:21,275 --> 02:29:21,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

1941
02:29:21,956 --> 02:29:23,357
