{"text": " tonight july 5th 2009 what happened to some games that disappeared from xbox live details emerge on last fm connectivity with the xbox a good ps2 emulation be coming back to the PlayStation 3 well hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of orange lounge radio we are that show dedicated to video games video gaming gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle and with you as always my name here is Rob Roberts and I'm always joined by well usually joined by two people but tonight only one tech master Loki in the house hello how are you doing time has to Loki doing fine dark Sakura the happiest bunny on the farm who was usually here to provide her witty commentary in the classic game of the week she's out this week sadly she is in Las Vegas so I guess it's really not that sad because I'm sure she's having a great time in Vegas she's hanging out with one of our olr staffers tiara our our our our our and I'm sure they're having fun being big giggling girls and know that I always tease them about that but I know they're having a good time nerding it up I'm sure if there was a Star Trek experience I'm sure they'd be there right now but sadly it's closed but yes so they reopened it they're going to reopen it soon but it's not open yet especially you know the worst time to close it right before the movie comes out I know I'm a potential bummer whoops well we still have you guys in our chat room chat that orange launch radio.com I don't know I wonder if dark Sakura might be listening and I think her and tiara just kind of hanging out tonight they're just kind of away so if so I expect angry text messages they shouldn't be listening they should be gambling and seeing shows and that's right go see Cirque du Soleil other debauchery exactly well remember what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas so but it's it's interesting though what you guys don't understand is that we're still at her house the studio is still at it you know studio dark Sakura so we're here in her house when she's not here which is a little creepy but dance here you know Dan's entertaining company right now they're watching a movie I couldn't figure out what it was these last star fighter thing is what it is what's happened there was maybe it looks 80s horrific and yeah but anyhow you know they're they're doing their thing so it looks like there was a fourth of july bash going on here because you can see all the fireworks out in the street all the residue how was your fourth of july I didn't buy fireworks because in California the fireworks all suck here they're they're getting more safe and sane as the time goes on so you buy you know $100 for the fireworks and they last like five minutes because they're crap and so being smart and you know just plain lazy and broke this year decided you know I'm just not gonna buy fireworks so we decided to go down to our local mall that was doing a fireworks show and so we went kind of sat on my sister's apartment lawn and watched them from there so that was alright you know it's like whatever which is funny cuz Loki and I were at the same show last night except I was in the actual mall parking lot which is funny this is the unplanned we were at the same place yeah so took us an hour to get out of that goddamn lot three minutes for us you suck well we were far enough away so yeah that's what we basically did and it was okay I mean it's just I don't know it's fourth of July how many times do you have to hear the same songs and the same fireworks although this year they did have smiley-face fireworks so that was kind of neat you know innovating a little bit but yeah that was alright and then actually it's kind of funny cuz normally we used to go to like the Folsom rodeo just because they have fireworks there as well and actually this year the night before because they do the rodeo like for you know three days or so so they like the Friday Saturday Sunday or maybe this year is Thursday Friday Saturday anyways so they had fireworks each night and unfortunately the second night apparently there was an accident and one of the mortars shot off into the crowd burning people so don't sad I miss that so oh well but um yeah that's pretty much it isn't like final destination where you had a premonition to not go to know if by premonition meaning that the rodeo sucked every year then yeah I guess well we normally don't actually go into the rodeo we just watch it from outside but and they would they started figuring out the people are doing that so they shot they keep shooting the fireworks even lower and I mean that's dangerous enough but you know because they go hey you gotta come in the rodeo to see the fireworks you know so we're gonna shoot them ten feet above everybody it's like come on but I know well I reading our chat room at chat that orange laundry calm looking at some of the commentary a tiger claws suggesting we need someone to make olr fireworks fireworks that explode into the olr logo hey I'd be down for that except they're private I love it dark Ted see this is why can't they play America fuck yeah during a show I said the exact same so did I I said the exact same thing last night were you listening to the whole simulcast they didn't yes that was crap they're playing you know god bless the USA and all they you know patriotic stuff I was like they need to just bust out with America fuck yeah like really something like some good rock music or something it's always the same like crap or you know Bruce Springsteen you know even really the music I mean it was just kind of sort of you know it I don't know just I would go to a fireworks show like that America fuck yeah and just that the biggest fire you could possibly imagine well since I like fire a lot not only did I see the fireworks by the way happy 4th of July to all the other American folks listen to our program if you're not American well I hope you had a good weekend nonetheless and you happy Canada Day to those our friends in Canada because that was just this past week as well three days before ours exactly and you know what it's not really I mean a lot of people I guess celebrate independence I just celebrate the fact they get the light stuff on fire exactly that's all I really celebrate but I think that's something that the whole world can celebrate okay some of those safe insane fireworks though are a little crazy okay because like okay we really like fire so not only do we go to the public fireworks show but then we came back and let off some of our private stash and you know Victoria Victoria was there and she had brought her 11 year old brother like stepbrother or something came came with her and he's pretty cool like we were talking video games and stuff he thought it was cool that I played Xbox and had a show on the net and all that stuff and he likes video games and stuff I guess him and Victoria actually bought at one of the safe and stay insane stands it's called a bazooka and it is literally a firework that you sit on your shoulder and you're like the fuse on the other end and it shoots off like a masses amounts of color and sparks and I'm like okay wait a minute isn't this something that you like sit on the ground and do this whole thing when they're like no the lady at the thing told us that you you all put it on your side like a bazooka or is this a video game show a super scope six it's super scope six of fireworks you have to literally like put it on your shoulder okay like I thought it was going to be a pathetic little display like a sparkler or something no this thing was a like it didn't last very long it was only about like 30 seconds but it shot off like monsters of color and sparks like so much that the kid got afraid and was started backing up a little bit and we were all actually kind of like um this can't be good but he was like scared to hold it and all this stuff we were like just you and Victoria was just like you fucking bought it you fucking hold it this is great so you know teaching them young so yeah and it was it was cool we set it off and it was it was it was very amusing at least for those 30 seconds the other thing we did during 4th July is we were watching Comedy Central all day where they had a marathon of like stand-up comedy which is awesome so there's a bunch of comedians and they're like oh yeah that's that guy that I wanted to see you know it's those pretty much it yeah we don't have any unfortunately at our club we don't have cool things like Roman candles here yeah he's asking if I'm talking about Roman candles no you don't point this wasn't something you point upwards you hold it like a bazooka or a super scope six and it shoots sideways but what's shooting out looks like the type of thing you would see in a normal safe and sane firework I don't know how to describe this for people not in California but like you know the just the little sparks to go you know like the little little tiny flames of red green yellow it's not what it used to be like sparklers don't really sparkle anymore they're just kind of a little flame and yeah they look like colors flames sparks coming out but you know we basically use the sparklers and I was just like you know pucks and basically but yeah I mean I've seen my friend's dad is a firefighter and or fire chief actually and he gets you know he confiscates all the fireworks conference gates yeah unquote stashes them for his own fireworks and my brother was a firefighter I know all about confidence so they have you know they had like little boxes that are mortars and stuff you know just like stuff that if you were in any other state you'd probably be able to get and then of course every year their thing is that they try to light off more and more ground flowers each year so like last year I think they lit off like 400 ground flowers I mean it was the funniest we saw it and now I have to describe for those don't know the ground flowers I mean everybody's probably seen these even even in places where fireworks are legal these things are cool like you light them and they go and they start like red and then they turn green and they shake on the ground and spin around you can't get those anymore huh did they finally ban them no I don't think so really we didn't have any this year they're around okay yeah so they have those and they try their thing was as a you know big group or party and stuff they tried to light off more and more each year I think the year we went they were doing like 250 I mean it's been getting more and more this was many years ago but it was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen it literally was a pile that they meticulously you know stacked up and you know tide fuses together and all sorts of crazy stuff and it was the loudest buzzing just like the whole street is just full of smoke and like lights in it it's so like breathtaking you just can't stop you have to like bust out laughing because it's the most ridiculous thing you've ever used wanted to cry it was so amazing it was it was crazy I wish we had video of it but it's that sounds like you know how like you'll spend like all day setting up dominoes for just that one minute thrill when you knock them all over basically exactly what it sounds like to me it's gotten so big now that like you know they literally have like four or five piles of this stuff and it like by the time it's done it's just like there's like a block radius of justice ground flowers just left it the whole ground flower bomb pretty much it's awesome nice that's amazing a lot of fun alright well hey we're at we talked a lot about fire and fireworks and I'm sure the kids love that but let's talk about video games a little bit with how was your gaming week Loki how was your gaming week I didn't play much I played of course the usual hacked Grand Theft Auto 4 and yes I have people requesting you know that I play with them and stuff online I can't play with you guys online because our new systems are modded so we have a special version of it and it just wouldn't work I mean we have items that I've created and who knows if it crashed the game if I tried playing with you guys most likely you would have you be seen as firing off all these crazy weapons and you wouldn't be able to do that because it's just the way it works so you know not to and also the other thing our work games we don't invite other people in it's just the four of us or three of us or whoever's playing that's just the way it is but um so it's not hurt not that I'm trying to ignore anybody I'm just saying that people have been asking me to invite him it's just like yeah I can't do that so sorry anyways so beyond that stuff it's just getting crazy just you just stuck up just a minute you just stuck I'm not stuck up I play with other people but um let's see here then also I've been playing I tried angry berry I finally got to work I found out that it actually wasn't the game broken it was actually our internet at work is kind of it's got a weird firewall on it they have us was the 80s 86 3000 or something like that it's some weird web filter that they have well they've only like unblock certain ports or something so for whatever reason like we can play live but like the community game stuff doesn't work because community games whether you guys know it or not you actually have to be connected to live to use any of the community games even if you bottom and they're on your system you have to connect to live in order for it to work that's kind of like what happens with an Xbox Live arcade game if you're not on your own console that you bought it on the air under your account it'll kind of check live first exactly sounds like that but you know I these are the consoles I bought it or it's the games I bought on this console so it's kind of annoying so for you know I didn't realize this but at work I was getting this weird error message and it's weird too because other community games I've gotten have worked just fine but maybe I wasn't like maybe they changed something or whatever because I played a carny vale and that was kind of fun but anyways so angry berry for whatever reason didn't work at work but then I tried it again at home I redownloaded and everything and it works fine so I played a little bit of that and that game is absolutely crazy and very very hard and just absolutely ridiculous with you know smashing old women with buses and all sorts of crazy stuff we talked about this a few shows back by the way if you have no idea what he's talking about yeah it's a fighting game where you are Barack Obama yes you're very you're Barack Obama and it's got it's got like all sorts of crazy like enemies and stuff and all sorts of political references so it's great so definitely we're checking out things only like 400 Microsoft points so I think it's worth that I would like to see a game like this but with Sarah Palin I think it would be very funny especially now that she's not going to be the governor of Alaska anymore if you've been watching the news at all this week I you know what else is you going to do in her spare time but save save the world from crime that would be funny and then other than that I actually played some more fuel this week and tried the online stuff you know there really is no one online I did see Rob online but you know it just so happened like he'd be in a race when I was doing the free mode and then I'd go into a race because he was you know in a race and then he'd be doing free mode and it's just this wasn't working out but I mean I don't even know how exactly that works if it's like fable to where like I have to drive to your location actually find you I'm sure you do because that would be annoying and I don't know where anybody is so oh well but the game is fun and you know now that I figured out how to cheat and teleport different spots on the map to get different vista points and stuff it makes it nice and easy but there was funny though because the first section of the game the first little region that you're in I didn't realize that I've only done one page of the challenges I'm like what the hell oh why is this challenge say I'm not done I'm like I've done all six of them I'm like oh there's a page over whoops damn it so I went by the way that happens with races too in the second area in tsunami zone or whatever it's called there's six races not three so just watch out for that okay why can't we put more once you get fooled I don't know why they did it that way but it's important and as the tsunami reef or what I think it's what's called tsunami reef because those races not only will unlock you get your challenge Doppler the livery Doppler but you also get three cars that are new cars when you run into them you unlock a vehicle so it's important to play all those races if you want to get all the vehicles yeah I do because I'm actually tired of driving as the one side I did all those unlock codes for different vehicles nice they're kind of it but I like the clothing so I kept the clothing but um yeah it's so fun and actually you know I really wish I had more time to play because I would be playing it a lot more but I've been busy with that and other things yeah and still haven't got a chance to play Wii Wii Sports Resort let me I get to this question from Jay rod in chat because you were talking about angry berry and it kind of brought up community games Jay rod wants to know are those community games free to download they're free to demo yes but they do cost money if you want to actually buy the registered version it's just like Xbox Live Arcade so the community games tend to be a lot cheaper and I mean the lowest price on the community games 200 Microsoft points and another thing too I haven't really gotten a chance to play around to get the new like kind of game making program kodu is actually out now and 400 Microsoft points five bucks for a game that you can make games in and send them to your friends and share stuff like that excellent deal so definitely check that out very cool anything else for your gaming week that's it you know I don't really have a lot to share with my gaming week I haven't really played a whole lot of new games I'm almost embarrassed to admit I've been playing a lot of Facebook games this week I know I know I should hang my head in shame all the credibility I had as a gamer is kind of shot but I don't know I've just been addicted to those crappy little Facebook games I've been oh god I don't even know if I really want to admit this but I've been playing one called sorority life sorority yes shut up it's like oh yeah I did it's like something it's like mafia but it's a sorority fight it's something my boyfriend got me hooked on but it's it's got all these little mini games to like bejeweled and stuff I think here's what it is you know how I quit the MMOs I think I have this inherent need to be leveling something like I'm leveling a character in this stupid-ass sorority life game like all of three I don't know I need to I do I need to go play something else like that but keep in mind also I have a roommate so I can't have the TV whenever I want a period so keep in mind that's a big reason why I don't always play like Xbox games and you get a VGA cable for making for my monitor yeah I'm maybe I do maybe that is something I did my computer all the time that's all I really play my 360 well here's something else I don't want to get teased too much I didn't play all those Facebook games all week although I did play some more legitimate things like bejeweled and text twist and they have UNO on Facebook now I don't know if you're aware but they have UNO on Facebook that is similar to the Xbox live one except you instead of seeing like webcams you're seeing people's little Facebook icons and you're in a little chat room so you can actually play UNO so you know I was checking a lot of that out this week but I also got a new laptop this week fries on a really good deal on laptops this weekend because it's 4th of July and all that stuff so I actually went and got a new laptop it's a Toshiba so it's not a bad brand 2 gigahertz machine 3 gigs of RAM separate video card inside it's not like an onboard video it's got a separated video card $399.99 for his laptop I know it's a sweet deal but what's also sweet about it here's where the rest of my gaming week comes into play because now it's back to a 32-bit operating system since I don't have so much RAM or what have you I can play game tap games again so I actually spent some time playing civilization 4 because I missed it and that was one of the big games I would play through game tap so I know I let out a lot of game tap hate on a previous show because it would not work with my Windows Vista 64-bit but now I'm running Windows 7 and yeah I installed the release candidate that we all got at e3 I decided you know what since I have a new laptop kind of like a fresh start when better time to upgrade my OS so I upgraded to Windows 7 I haven't played enough games on it yet I'm not familiar enough with the operating system yet I do like it seems to be a faster version of Vista but without all the stuff that made Vista so annoying like it's not asking me like 50 times I'm saying there are you sure you want to install this so-and-so wants to access your computer it's only done that when I've installed stuff otherwise it leaves me alone and it's it's so much easier to turn off the warning messages and stuff so that was one big improvement I noticed right off the bat I do think Windows 7 will be better than Vista that's for sure better than XP I don't know still too early to tell I do like though here's the one huge thing I noticed if I can talk operating systems for a minute instead of having all your windows at the bottom like you know how like right now you can see okay I have Firefox open IRC Adobe Audition the mixer and all this stuff that you see there okay instead of it that imagine that what would happen is that you'd see the little icon in the quick launch bar that you had on XP and it's just like it's a different color like the button looks raised because you have windows open and then when you hover over the raised button you see little previews of all the windows that's another huge change in Windows 7 so you save so much real estate on the bottom of the screen with all your windows open at once that was pretty cool so I'm noticing little things here and there but being able to play all the old computer games I was missing from not having game tap work on a newer OS was was kind of nice so that's cool I'm happy about that rama in our chat room says Windows 7 release candidate will expire after a year yes I'm aware that the two-hour shutdowns begin in March 2010 but look that's March 2010 still a heck of a long ways away and apparently my laptop comes with some type of free upgrade to Windows 7 anyway because I have like Vista premium came with it I don't know they were telling me this at fries like if I send them there is a thing that you can up it's it's gonna either be free or a small fee I wouldn't even mind paying a small fee honestly but I you know if I contact the manufacturer I has held on to my receipt so I can get the seven free cuz I'm I'm sure I will prefer seven to Vista I can already tell I prefer seven I just feel weird if I bought an operating system so I'm gonna hold out for the pirated version look if your laptop comes with it for free I mean oh yeah you know so I'm entitled to it right it's not a piracy thing it's it came with my laptop no I'm thinking about my computer that's you so there you go it's not that I don't want to pay for it it's just I don't want to pay for it yeah Rama and chat says don't worry you get a free upgrade and let's see Tiger class says the deals you see about home being 49 and professional being 99 it's for those about pcs with a Vista that's interesting because that means that that means it's kind of like an apology for Windows Vista Rama and chat goes on as of last Friday when you buy any computer you get a low cost or free upgrade for seven that's awesome I picked a great time to upgrade didn't I whoo nice so I was happy with my laptop purchase I'm telling you if you're in the market for new computers right now that's a great time especially the economy being the way it is and everything people or the you can find some dirt cheap sales you know I've and I believe me I found those netbooks tempting for like 200 250 dollars but seriously just spending another like 150 getting a nice nice system I'm very happy with my purchase and think about it that is the cost of a PlayStation 3 and only 150 dollars more than the cost of a PSP go I was listening to a old episode or a lot when I say old I mean just a couple weeks old we were kind of in that debate about the PSP go and how Sony is absolutely being idiotic with their price points it's what's killing that generation 49 I mean the 249 can buy you a freaking laptop and we talk about how you know PSP's are cool because they can do music and games and you know kind of the thing all the things that a laptop can do well guess what Sony a laptop costs as much as you're charging for your PSP go I this whoever that was it's so frustrating because it's not that they're bad systems it's just the Sony's getting it's just like when I remember the PlayStation 3 everybody was like you know they're showing you know the system everything and it was like yeah this looks awesome this is gonna be sweet you know and then they're like oh and it's gonna be 599 you're like dah you stupid you know what at least I'll give them the fact that they did have blu-ray which at the time was an expensive technology it was fine yeah hella fucking risky for them because at that time a winner had not been declared in the HD DVD blu-ray war but to their credit and I'll give credit where credits do I give Sony a hard time and I'll give them a good time when they do things that are right they they were right they they were lucked out with this blu-ray thing they want to say lucked out but they won out with this blu-ray thing and that's gonna be a huge asset to them as this generation continues I think you will see more people that decide oh I need to get a blu-ray player why don't I just get a PlayStation 3 just like people said last time I need to get a DVD player well I'll just get the PlayStation 2 because it plays games you know my significant other has a PlayStation 2 doesn't play like any video games on it uses it as a DVD player there are a lot of people out there like that like that that will buy it as a player but kind of knowing that oh well you know if I wanted to play games on it or had somebody entertain I could it's good but see that's the thing though is that's good to increase your install base but when you look at you know something like that then think about all the people that did buy it for mainly a blu-ray player their number is already you know for being in third place aren't that great and if you take off you know X amount of percentage of that you know saying that these people are only going to be using it for mainly a blu-ray player that's really not good you know and they were kind of hoping that they would get a little bit of a bump from you know people buying it as a cheap blu-ray player but it's not working out for them Marissa con gusto and chat makes an interesting comment chat that orange laundry calm if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening as we tape at all games calm Marissa says I was talking about the economy with new game prices the other day with a friend the prices have gone down over the years recollecting that if a new game was $60 in 1993 for me but I still wonder if the new titles can command the same opening price with the unemployment rate skyrocketing well and somebody followed up in chat with Sony sure hope so I to some extent they do say that even in a recession people will not neglect their entertainment I mean look at movies transformers did extraordinarily well at the box office even with the fact that tickets cost like 1025 a pop now me movies are freaking expensive but transformers had what the second best weekend only to the dark night I mean it's still huge business you know it's there's a lot of freaking money a lot of people want to see a movie a lot of people aren't willing to sacrifice you know entertainment I mean they've made cuts throughout their life you know in different aspects of everything and they want a little bit of a kind of a treat for themselves for you know cutting to suffer yeah pretty much yeah I mean and you know they can still afford to go to movies it's just you know what you got to be smarter about if you really want to pay you know they go see a movie don't buy the popcorn and soda there go see a matinee there you go you save yourself a ton of money because it's just that the you know concession prices are so expensive and the movie prices are pretty or go to the drive-in damn oh yeah and save it the drive-in with the double features and bring it in your own crap in the backseat and everything and hell yeah yeah the pride I'm surprised the drive-ins do not thrive in an economy like this well you notice member they are talking about closing the drive-in that we have in Sacramento here for a while I always do they are every year they're talking about oh they're talking about let's put in a 25 screen theater well because they could charge more exactly that doesn't mean they'll have the business for fixing the drive-in charge more for that charge a little more anyway sorry we're getting a little bit off topic but let's see alpha kenanagram and Chad is hoping believing the Ars Technica mole is right about the ps3 price drop in ps3 slim since a lot of great 80 gigabyte bundles are going to sell with Wally LBP a little big planet bundle and Metal Gear Solid 4 Killzone 2 bundle I don't know I guess we'll get into some of the Sony news in just a little bit here when we get into the news tonight but I I wanted to say though quickly about Sony and the PSP go I think whereas people are willing to make sacrifices to their entertainment there's a limit and I predict as I'm sure many of you do but I I'm willing to kind of put it all out there I fully predict the PSP go is going to tank and I'm not talking about like not not it's not just going to not sell it's going to not sell horrifically like it is going to be an embarrassment to Sony as I would predict the PSP go and it's all based off that price point because when you put one of those puppies on the shelf next to a Nintendo DSi that's only or an iPhone 40 or an iPhone that's $99 I'm sorry what does Sony have to justify that PSP go with not a lot and I'm sorry fanboys I know you got your games and I know you got your multi stuff that you can do in there I'm sorry it is not just now they did say and then you know I know this doesn't justify anything they did say that the processor is going to be four times you know it's going to be a little bit faster so would be the average gamer does not give two shits I didn't say they're not going to sell any of those things well yeah there's plenty of Sony fanboys that'll be forking over the money but it's going to be an embarrassment they're going to have to cut the price and make they're going to have to that they will there will be damage control by the even once it seems to be out like August October well then by then they won't do they won't be able to fix it in time for this year's holidays but next next year for the holidays it's going to be a well especially you know they've got you know the PSP 3000 still out there now if you really want to PSP you know if you think about it huh let's see here I can buy this PSP system that's $100 cheaper and you know get 16 gigabytes of storage or whatever for that for probably a lot less than $100 so there you go you save money right there amazed at suman chat asks sky tank worse than the GBA micro I think actually that's not a bad comparison because that was a dumb idea to you know I think it was one of those things is like oh how cute you know little tiny gameboy but like in practicalness you know come on those GBA micros are a little silly I think this is actually worse because the reason why is you're you're basically saying to your retailers okay you need to sell these and the retailers are going well why because then this is basically a system that you can only download games for it and you're not letting me sell Neil vouchers for these games and stuff so why should I push your product and that's really what's come down to it like I have some my cell through stores that I deal with they're like I'll bring in a couple because people are going to want them but that's it I'm not going to you know push these things at all because why should I they're cut into my sales yeah I this is just going to be an embarrassment it's going to set digital distribution for games back a couple years single-handedly because then Sony's going to blame it on that that people aren't ready for digital distribution no blame it on your price and the fact that it's a system without a UMD drive should be cheaper see what happened with the price you know before with the PlayStation 3 hello come on I mean did you not learn from that at all I want to spend this whole show bitching about Sony's price point because we've done it before but it's just it's just frustrating as somebody who who wants to see the good in Sony and wants to see a lot of the good stuff they have on the horizon to just watch them literally literally take out a gun pointed at their foot and pull the trigger to watch them literally do this in front of our eyes is frustrating as a gamer I'm sorry as someone who tries very hard to see the good in Sony yeah anyhow let's get into some gaming news I don't really have a lot for housekeeping tonight visit us on Twitter at olr send us emails at mailbag orange laundry calm etc etc Loki go ahead yes so actually I was gonna say you know we can talk a little bit about those bundles that they had there's actually two different bundles that are available now for a gig system which is kind of funny because they're like kind of clearing them out you know because everybody thinks oh they're gonna come out with some new 160 gig systems or something like that that kind of goes back into what the Ars Technica mole said that the like a slimmer ps3 will be coming out actually as soon as August and there's a Taiwanese firm that said they've been awarded the manufacturing contracts for this ps3 slim system and apparently you know Engadget Chinese they reported that the two Taiwanese manufacturing companies have been awarded contracts to build Sony's new streamlined ps3 and according to udn.com half the orders have gone to Taiwanese group Foxconn and the other half have gone to pigotron wasn't a Taiwanese lawyer that tried to cease and desist the early images of the ps3 box to yes it was and apparently you know these were the manufacturers that have I think manufactured the original ps3 so it makes sense and you know they also said that the timing makes sense the rumor that it's gonna be released in August because in Japan they actually have more console sales during the summer as opposed to you know the holiday season for you know us in the United States and Canada so you know it makes sense maybe that they're trying to sell off all these you know ps3 80 gig systems to kind of clean out their inventory and they're doing these kind of bundles to you know push out some more systems to kind of make space for this new system which who knows maybe going into our next story you know with the whole emulation thing so tell us a little more about the emulation thing then so if you're gonna if you're gonna open that worms let's talk about it definitely I mean if you think about okay why would I need a ps3 you know slim system when I have you know ps3 well there's rumors now that they may be you know bringing back the emulation this is coming from the fact that there has been a new patent filed I guess back in December you know I'm talking about full emulation of the emotion engine and the motion engine was the chipset that they had in the PlayStation 2 it's basically what you had in the no launch ps3 systems that allowed you to play the PlayStation 2 games and then of course they took out one of those two chips for the 80 gig system that was with Metal Gear Solid 4 and they were doing some of that with software emulation then later on they took out all the chips and so now you know you have no emulation but you know like they did with the PlayStation 1 PlayStation 1 is completely you know software emulated and you can play your discs and you can download PlayStation 1 games so you better believe it that they're probably gonna have PlayStation 2 game downloads here's my thing though are they really gonna you know patches in allow everybody to play their PlayStation 2 games or are they just gonna really strictly leave this as software emulation for the titles that are downloaded so that you have to buy your games again do they want to piss me off or not is basically the question that's out on the table I would hope if the emulation is being built in there to play these old games and put them out there on the service which makes a lot of sense as to why why now why this is happening especially with digital distribution being so big maybe the PSP go will leave because if this thing has a faster processor right you said the process for maybe these PSP goes are gonna be armed to play the PlayStation it's not gonna work because the the patents actually for the cell processor to interpret okay so it's never mind you know unless they're shoving the micro cell processor in the PSP go which not gonna happen all right so that train to rail never mind so but if they're gonna do this whole thing with you know the PlayStation 3 it's obvious that they could easily open it up so that image is just like PlayStation 1 I can put a PlayStation 1 disk in my PlayStation 3 and play it there's no I mean people forget it is backwards compatible PlayStation 1 but just not PlayStation 2 which you know is is noticeably missing from the newer models anyway which I think most people have I don't have a model I think play the old stuff see that's the thing it's like how greedy are they is what might the real question that we need to be asking them because they want the PlayStation 2 this still sell well they dropped it down to $99 and they still care about that system because it's still selling pretty well sometimes outselling the PlayStation 3 but are they going to be greedy enough to wear that when this does come out this you know if they do happen to release this you are they going to do it as a you know patch where it will allow you to play any PlayStation 2 game I think that would be good that would probably get a lot of their you know people that are pissed off at them off their backs and look really good in like a PR standpoint but if they are super greedy they may also say hey we're just gonna limited this to you know the games that you have to download so you have to rebuy the games you know because people like buying games from us and we can sell them I think that they should release it as a patch so that you can play whatever games you have because you know what people are still gonna buy the games and you especially games that they can't find anymore can you imagine downloading the original you know katamari or something like that I mean that'd be fun very interesting comment in the chat here at chat dot orange hundred dot com from game guru what do you think of this Loki I think Sony has to kill the PlayStation 2 and get the PlayStation 2 owners to move on that also makes sense because I think a lot of people are clinging to the PlayStation 2 and are upgrading well sure you put a $99 system next to a $399 system and people are you know the average consumer again that's just looking for something to entertain their 9 and 10 year old is gonna go for the $99 system and also a lot of people are upgrading because they're a law I have all these PlayStation 2 games you know I don't want to buy a new system and not be able to play them which I never understood that argument the first place if you're buying a new system you still have your old system you can still play your old games it's not like that all sudden your new old system is just gonna vanish you know it's not gonna you know incinerate oh speaking as someone who stopped playing PlayStation 2 games on the PlayStation 3 came out a lot of times it's about space wires and just the convenience of it convenience is huge and to me owning a Wii and Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3 there's a lot of fucking cords behind my TV and it's a bit of a mess with all the different controllers all the different cables all the different shit I mean and then add into that rock band instruments and so forth my roommate probably just looks at this and goes my god this is so much shit you know he's kind of right and to throw into that oh now I'm gonna I want to whip out the PlayStation 2 and hook that up to and play that you know it's a lot you know but here we are in the house of dark soccer and Dan they have all these old systems they do whip them out once in a while and play all the old stuff but I think it takes a certain type of gamer for that again the average consumer I think gets annoyed with all the stuff to hook up yeah you know there's people keep this in mind guys you know I realize as gamers who probably download this podcast interested in the hardcore stuff there's a lot of people out there who don't even know how to hook this shit up to their TV they have to call somebody over to explain you maybe you've been called before think about it haven't you ever been called to install something like this like a VCR a DVD player a PlayStation onto somebody's TV or had to fix it because they didn't like a wire came out they didn't know what happened there's a lot of people that don't understand that stuff and the other thing too though it's kind of I mean presumptuous of them to assume that everybody that has a PlayStation 2 is gonna upgrade to a PlayStation 3 I think a lot of people have gotten tired of their shit and I've already upgraded to a Wii or well it's not really an upgrade but you know have gotten a Wii or have upgraded to like a 360 or something like that and you know I was one of those people I hated the Xbox fucking hated it I was very clear in the show that I absolutely Sony fanboy 100% me too and then when the Xbox 360 came out it was like okay well I'll get this in you know a PlayStation 3 later on but you know then PlayStation 3 came out and I was like I'm not paying $600 for this luckily you know I I go on for free so I didn't have to do that but you know if I didn't get for free I would not be buying it so I mean it's just it's really you know in Microsoft's really changed the way I think about them because you know with the Xbox is just like oh my god the system's huge it's like Microsoft learned from their mistakes Microsoft said oh okay you know we didn't cater enough to the role-playing game fans we didn't care enough to some of these audiences we were the casual gamer we're gonna try and fix those things didn't happen overnight but you really see that stuff starting to come together with a 360 Sony sat on their butt rested on their laurels a little bit and thought people were gonna pay a premium price because of blu-ray and all this stuff and they wouldn't really have to work into these features and now they're kind of having paying for it a little bit trying to play a little bit of catch-up which you know they're doing to make success Nintendo fucking smoked weed and made the system that came to them in their dream I don't know what they did but whatever they did worked like his Nintendo just woo the Wii was kind of an outer space remember we all first heard of that we were like fuck is this they redesigned the GameCube and made it you know with some wireless controllers is basically it you know more or less so I don't know yeah I'd be interested to see what happens but I have a feeling if there is going to be any sort of software emulation we're gonna see it probably by this fall j-rod interesting comments in chat here j-rod says I used to be all about my 360 but with Microsoft's piss-poor hardware quality I've moved on to a PlayStation 3 Rama says Microsoft doesn't have piss poor hardware quality they jumped the gun to beat Sony and I kind of agree with both of those comments that yeah you definitely noticed that the Microsoft has the harder higher hardware issue and honestly that system as a piece of hardware loud obnoxious not the most attractive thing in my living room but I deal with it because of all the things it provides that make sense I you know it's not actually for me the audio and the sound you know portion of this you know system as far as how loud is and stuff doesn't really bother me I have a computer that has countless amount of fans on it it's super loud and I really don't care I just don't even notice it anymore just totally tune it out but yes the yes the PlayStation 3 is immensely quiet you know compared to the 360 definitely all right well let's move on to some more news and I think we'll continue talking about Sony news I want to talk about this some bundles and I think this to come up a little earlier a chatter I had mentioned this but I did just kind of want to reference this it was something we wanted to go over tonight is that there there does appear to be some new Sony bundles on the way apparently a Best Buy employee tipped off some of the blogs this week that there is an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 out there now it has copies of Metal Gear Solid 4 and Killzone 2 with it all for $400 so that's not too bad considering you're getting two big games there for $400 also apparently now I guess rumors are saying is that there's going to be another bundle that could have LittleBigPlanet I guess with it as well. Yeah they do have it there's one I think they do have it for LittleBigPlanet and WALL-E. The Blu-ray interesting that's especially interesting considering WALL-E isn't a Sony movie it's a Disney movie that's a that's a little weird to me you would think they would throw in a Sony movie why a kung fu panda or something well that's not so what I understand the need that you know they're obviously they're going for the family system but it's very interesting that it's a Disney movie like that sounds more like something Costco would do you know Costco bundles all this stuff together they don't need the manufacturer to do it very interesting but yeah those are some bundles I guess out there in the wild so they are trying to add more value to the PlayStation 3 so you know it's getting to be a little more reasonable. Definitely something that's not quite reasonable it's a little weird is GameStop they've had some they have three bundles that they have available as part of their Wii summer fun bundles and it's almost like a bad joke they literally have if you buy one of these bottles you can get a Wii bundled with a squirt gun, a Wii bundled with rubber duckies, or a Wii bundled with pirate tattoo arm sleeves. Why? I don't know but these are crappy little carnival gifts they're just throwing in with the Wii is that is that really going to motivate someone to go get Nintendo Wii? Oh I want to get the rubber ducky! It's absolutely crap because if you think about it I mean these are like dollar store toys I mean why would it's like oh you know I got to get a free water gun I mean it's a cheap ass water gun and you know that's the kind of thing now with like GameStop and you know a lot of these places you know a lot of people are like my customers I deal with you know bitching about GameStop having the exclusives for you know different content and stuff unlockables you know exclusive things like for example in the conduit they had you know the all-seeing eye was blue in the game that's it it just happened to be blue who cares you know it's like big whoop and this is kind of more like that it's like okay where the hell did you get these free water pistols for and why would you you know even think about bundling them with the Wii I mean why even bother it's just crap but I don't know huh I guess they're trying to give some added value to this but I'm not so sure value at all it's like take a dump and put it in a bag and throw it in there you worth more than that stuff I mean seriously it's just what the hell do you thinking the only thing it did successfully do for them is getting people to talk about on blogs and on this show because it's you know so asinine but that's not a positive that's not gonna make anybody go hey I want to go purchase that GameStop because they get crap with it I again I'm gonna go back to the Costco example Costco will bundle in useful things with these systems like a free game or something but now it's free sometimes you're paying a little more money you know the extra controller but you want to go bundles Costco is a good place to go there are some games out there they're absolute shit that seriously they could probably purchase for really really cheap and they could throw that in there and that would at least be something because it's least a game I can play with you know the Wii whereas pirate tattoo sleeves I have no idea what the hell I would use that for to be a pirate are alpha-kin anagram and chat says Rob you would probably be a great voice actor that's like my fucking dream job don't even joke I would love to do if there's anybody out there possibly at a game company that is creating a game you need cheap voice acting I will I would I will willingly be a voice actor in the game that's like my dream to do voice I don't even care it could be like rubber ducky hunter 2009 I'll still do the voice acting because I think that would be awesome so yeah it sounds like could be an interesting bundle I guess for me for crap lovers a nice try there but I think you're gonna need to like me I'll do something else too Oh Shermy wants to get out you might know hey Shermy Oh Shermy the cat has been hiding and I think sure me wants to get out but now sure he's afraid live on air radio these these things happen we have cat drama going on I think sure he's afraid now we'll just keep moving just leave the door open for a little bit hopefully it's sure me old sneak out when we're not looking I don't really have anything else I want to get into right this second well more stories yeah sure well since we're talking about the we you might not even have to buy a we because apparently the emulators for the we have been doing a pretty good job themselves in fact the dolphin emulator which salsa does the GameCube games as well has now gotten you know some games playable and also you know coming out in 720 or 1080p so they're able to render the games a lot higher so that kind of gives you you know 16 16 times anti aliasing and they also had some other filters that are thrown on top of there but it kind of gives you an impression of what the we would look like if they came out with a we HD and honestly that kind of has me kind of excited for like a we HD if they were ever to do that because some of these games don't look bad actually rendered you know at a higher resolution and granted some textures are kind of I don't know low whereas but you know like mad world looks sweet super mario galaxy looks pretty awesome they had some other videos I saw of punch-out look pretty sweet but yeah there's a whole bunch of these and actually the emulator course is available now and you can check it out wait you can actually doubt that you could just put the we DVDs in your computer and play these games um I'm not sure if it reads it actually off the disk I'm not sure if you need like an ISO or something like that but I do know that it does support the we remote and none check if you happen to have like a Bluetooth adapter huh and this is just out there now it's out there now yeah and and the thing is endos not like worried about this and you also need a pretty I mean you need a decent computer to run it I mean granted your laptop would probably run this pretty well but like some of the ones that they're showing I think they're like 4 gig processors you know with 4 gigs of RAM you know pretty nice you know new graphics card and that kind of thing but still though I mean that's you know it leaves the door open because if you can emulate this stuff on a PC why not you know what is Shermey doing sure he's finding other places to hide I don't know just go outside kitty yeah you want to say hi to the listener Shermey no comment comment that's a resounding no nice sorry I didn't mean to let the kitty bring the show to a screeching halt but yeah this this is only slightly bothersome I would think for you know Nintendo that that somebody is actually doing HD was this a YouTube out there so YouTube they've got a whole bunch of these actually on this is a brawl that they have done on there but I mean it looks like nice it looks pretty cool yeah it does look pretty nice but yeah it's do some searches online for we emailers there's actually a guy who does our reviews of the emulators and the games and how they play in there and stuff like that I want to say let's see here I think it's um Raini Bara Hona is the user on YouTube re ne ba ra ho na and he has a bunch of different videos actually watched the Metroid Prime 3 corruption one earlier but he has reviews I think I think he's the one that's doing the reviews on him let me get some comments from chat real quick because game guru wants to clarify PCs can't read Nintendo optical discs so I was a little crazy there with that comment but also tells me that Nintendo could get 720p with a firmware update to use those four unused connections I don't know I mean keep in mind these emulators are running off computer hardware and a Wii is running off the hardware of two game cubes maybe it can't just simply run this with a firmware update or I would have hoped they would have done it a long time ago I don't know yeah I don't know either do you think Nintendo should be worried about something like this I mean the fact that their system is being emulated while it is still out there and some might say better than the actual system itself they should be worried if it's actually because there are some minor texture problems and stuff like that like there'll be some textures that are supposed to be more transparent that aren't appearing transparent or like a few little issues but they're definitely playable so they should be worried if it's able to you know do that stuff and you don't necessarily need a you know we remote and nunchuck to play this you can actually lose with keyboard and mouse you know using the mouse as the Wii pointer or whatever and you know the keyboard as your joysticks or whatever so yeah I guess you know I would actually like to play a lot more of these things on here and you check them out see what the games look like because you know mad world look really sweet it kind of makes me wish they'd poured into the 360 or something and all they're doing is they're just smoothing the textures basically they're in the 16 16 times it's not like it was going back to reprogram these things or anything or any more work went into them or anything like that no not really and because the reason this was actually I mean this is the dolphin emulator was for the Game Cube and they just modified it to work with the Wii when the Wii came out because it's basically GameCube hardware and you know almost the same type of instruction set so I don't know I mean it's just you know goes to show you that the Wii is really you know very similar to a GameCube and kind of wish that they would do like a Wii HD because at the same time here's what they could do with their games they could upscale all the games that you have come out and they could you do some new or higher def games or something like that or you can spend the money and just get a new an upscaler for your you know home entertainment system and you can just do the same thing with Wii so well apparently there is a new Final Fantasy game on the way and it looks like this game is being made for the DS it was actually teased around there on the internet and then Famitsu I don't think actually no I'm sorry it came from jump magazine I believe is the the magazine that finally spilled the details on this it's Final Fantasy Gaiden it's a new kind of Final Fantasy RPG for the DS it looks a lot like the Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4 remakes that have happened recently but it's kind of a new story apparently it's about a boy who must rescue a princess from a witch your very typical kind of Final Fantasy sounding storyline their typical fantasy story although I'm sure the end of the world will somehow be worked into it as well the battle system is of course the one you all know and love the turn-based menu system there's apparently though now action points when you see your status you also have yellow dots that go with that and the actions that you want to do also have dots next to it that indicate how much it's going to cost so think of it sounds to me like it's not magic points but like fighting points a little different they're gonna be coming out in the u.s. actually I'm sorry it's gonna come out in the fall in Japan that would mean probably next year in the u.s. once they get it all translated it sounds right yeah there you go lots of fun Final Fantasy stuff I was bringing up here real quick I want to show you mad world running on the emulator and this actually should post this link in chat a chat that I was ready to call just of how sharp the game looks I mean cuz mad world it's all black and white and the line art and stuff like that you can see how it looks a little foggy right there that's you know the one of the problems with the emulator at least in this game but I mean look at how sharp everything looks it's just awesome very that is pretty neat you should share that in chat if definitely you haven't already chat dot orange launch rated calm that does look pretty nice yeah um let's see some other stuff we can talk about here we'll probably do one more story and then we'll get into the classic game of the week and part B of our show coming up a little later as well as your phone calls one eight seven seven game olr will open up the phones a little later on in the program well Nintendo might not be too worried about some games at least you know in this emulator Wii Sports Resort in Japan just came out what last week and already they've sold over 350,000 copies I'm actually selling it's the third fastest selling we title ever and it's moved three hundred fifty three thousand eight hundred and twenty seven copies as of June 30th so by now who knows but it's gonna be selling I think pretty well and who knows when it hits the US I know this thing's been selling like hotcakes already so I actually don't think you'll see the impressive day one numbers that you're seeing over in Japan I don't think the US audience especially those that are huge in the week are that as tuned in to you know when games are coming out and you know we were much more tuned in in our culture to win movies are coming out like you probably know what movies are opening up this week and actually I don't think most casual gamers and non hardcore gamers are as tuned in with the release dates so I don't think you'll see this have the same type of day one sales here but I think you'll see it grow quickly yeah definitely and I think a lot of you know casual gamers obviously probably be picking this up for like Christmas or you know the holidays there's a long period of time you know period of time and I mean look at like Mario Kart Wii it still sells really well only you know mark no Mario Party 8 that stuff sells really well it's just a lot of these games are just evergreen will sell for the life of the system so I could definitely see this lasting a long time and it probably will end up selling quite a bit and it could also be like we play whereas people bought this you know they could be buying this for we motion plus you know save some money that way and they get a game with it so I could definitely see something like that happening yeah I just don't think you know I think when it comes out here you're gonna see I bet you that first week oh I didn't sell nearly as well in the u.s. is it in Japan oh my gosh it's it's a failure for Nintendo mmm give it a couple months give it a couple months for the hardcore gamers who still love a Nintendo to pick it up and then their friends to see it and then their friends to see it and then CNN to do a news story on it and then Oprah to have it on her show give it some time wrong wrong it will not be Oprah having in our show it'll be Ellen DeGeneres because she likes hey Ellen Ellen has a very high rated show don't don't hate don't hate on Ellen I'm just saying Oprah's not she's more tech retarded as I'd like to put I don't know if I should admit that I was watching Oprah but I was I was changing the channels and landed on Oprah one day this is a couple months ago she had Facebook on her show they were talking they were doing I know Oprah I guess has this thing where she rips off the view now where she actually has a panelist of people on some some days of the week I don't know but she had the dude from Facebook they're talking about the business and I guess that was the same day that Oprah was launching her own Facebook account or official Facebook or something it was just like Twitter when she had Twitter on her show that site blew up remember that yeah when they announced the official Oprah Twitter don't underestimate the power of Oprah some might say that was the day the Twitter jumped the shark to j-rod says people scream failure if it doesn't sell a million in its first week remember how little big planet was a failure yeah I mean I would actually agree with you the little big planet not only is it one of the best games on PlayStation 3 right now period if not the best in some circles but I think that's still a game that sells fairly well I don't know PlayStation 3 figures that well but I have to be a consistent seller too I don't think it's really like tapered off horrifically or anything I think you know I don't think you can really compare Sony sales figures to Nintendo sales figures I think horribly underrated underappreciated and it's gonna be one of those games like katamari was where is horribly underrated underappreciated and you know granted we all as game fans might appreciate it and understand how awesome it is but the casual gamer they don't understand it and you know it's sad because I think if you put it in the hands of like someone that is more of a casual gamer and they actually played it they would probably think it's really cool but then again there's some people there's like oh my god controllers oh I can't I can't I can't do that although really the only you know stuff in little big planet is run jump and occasionally grab yeah but you have to understand these are the same people that can't hook up their damn game systems it's all color-coded true true yellow the yellow I mean it's matching matching colors can you not understand that I guess not some people can't some people can't all right should we get into the classic game of the week I think we shall did you want to say one more one more thing real quick is really quick go electroplankton is coming to DSI where in Japan only and of course it will be sold for oh that's a ripoff anyways it's picking their their breaking up electroplankton because it was 10 different little programs that you can make music with they're breaking them all up individually the 200 Nintendo points each so $20 total seemed kind of a ripoff if you ask me but I think that's what the game originally sold for I was to say you had to originally buy like it was weird they didn't even market this game big time you had to buy it through Nintendo site you can even get in stores remember yeah and having played electroplankton I don't get what the point is I mean it was it was neat for a second and then I put it down and never touches again so I can't recommend buying this but hey if you're in Japan and you want to waste you know some points there you go all right we are gonna get into the classic game of the week we like to take a few moments here at the end of part a every week to reflect on gaming's history and some of the games that helped bring the games we have today out there usually dark Sakura goes through her archives and picks a classic game of the week but since she's not here tonight the one and only Loki it's his turn to replace her with his entry into the classic game of the week and I believe he has picked a doozy this week so Loki what is the classic game of the week this week classic game of the week has been a game that I've wasted countless hours on one of my favorite games has been on every Nintendo system it would be Mario Kart not a Super Mario Kart Super Mario Kart yes careful well I like Mario Kart in general but Mario Kart one started all on the Super Nintendo came out in 1992 wow that was a long time ago and did quite well sold you know I think eight million copies worldwide and was the I think number two title for the super NES really yeah wow that must be only behind what Mario World even though that was the pack-in game I think so Wow Mario World actually was it I take it back it was not number two is number three but hey it's close enough I mean don't keep on country also I want to point out Game Guru and chat says Mario Kart wasn't on the NES or Game Boy true but they still called it Super Mario Kart the name of this game is Super Mario Mario Kart yes Super Mario Kart was one of those mode seven games you race around on kind of a flat track but of course you have little blocks and stuff that made the course and everything they had a bunch of different theme levels including you know the booze mansion and well they weren't really a mansion it was kind of like Doc's almost like dark place but a Bowser's castle of course they had the mushroom cup shell cup flower cup banana cup and you had unlocked you know each of the I think it'd be golden those in order to unlock the rest of the cup and of course who would forget you know who could forget the special cup that they had there with Rainbow Road which is awesome Rainbow Road was sweet and but the thing that I spent the most time on and oh so many hours lost to this versus mode versus in battle mode you know we played battle mode forever and battle mode of course you the object of the game was to pop the other carts three balloons and you know we've wasted so much time doing that but you'd have different shells of course the green shell was kind of dumbfire shell that you'd shoot straight ahead you've got red shell which you know is kind of a homing missile almost your bananas they drop behind you to you know get out the other player also you know your mushrooms for boosts and in the original game actually they had the feather that you get they could jump and that was handy for jumping walls or jumping the shortcuts and stuff like that of course later on they had more sequels for the game on practically every Nintendo system is actually on every Nintendo system and they even made its debut in the arcade with two arcade games Mario Kart arcade GP and GP to the first one of course I am famous for playing drunk during my bachelor party and which by far orange launch radios most viewed YouTube clip and I don't remember much of it but I'm actually did play it later on it was all right and it's not the same it doesn't have the same charm no it doesn't but uh you know of course the original Super Mario Kart game had quite a few characters in there you know they had some unlockable characters as well but the starting lineup of course yet Bowser Luigi Mario peach Toad and Yoshi and you can also unlock don't come junior and Koopa Koopa and of course the little trick is you can shrink those down as well and yeah pretty much it and it also actually made its way to the Guinness Book World Records gamers edition 2008 which goes to show you that they will put pretty much anything in this book but it was awarded the first console kart racing game and best-selling a handheld racing game course cuz you know was it really that yes it was really the first kart racing game interesting I wonder what they got the idea for this they actually fact-checked that stuff that seems awfully weird I don't doubt that it's true I mean I can't think of another one that there was but it's just kind of interesting yeah but uh yeah I mean lots of fun and you know of course my car we came out last year still pretty fun but you know it just doesn't have a charm I think of an original Mario Kart game which is available for virtual console download I believe remember correctly is this a good one it is I know Mario Kart 64 is I don't know about the classic though really I don't think the classic one is still up surprise surprise to it maybe it is and I just missed it amongst all the other crap that they put out honestly I haven't downloaded anything in person for a long time so it's been mainly we were this was my college dorm years by the way do you know what the epic battles we had on this game in my college dorm and this is probably about 96 or 97 or so I remember when the people upstairs got a Nintendo 64 and got Mario Kart 64 oh my god that was before I was not as big of a fan of 64 as I was this one but it was you know still really fun to play and I think I just this one is kind of one of those like you know sentimental type games for the love of God Nintendo when you put out a new Mario Kart game and I know how you like doing classic tracks and stuff is it gonna really kill you to not you know include all of the old battle courses or something like that they always seem to find the ones that like nobody played and let's just like bring that one back it's it's like come on well dude in that new one they had battle course 4 and that was the one we always played on the old school one was the you know with the squares square square kind of looking thing yeah we used to play that one all the time so it just wasn't the same though no I wasn't without the feather because you get the feather you can jump or the wall oh that's true I didn't think about the feather huh interesting all right well that's gonna do it for your classic game of the week Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo good pick yeah apparently a Super Mario Kart is not available on virtual console only Mario Kart 64 damn it all right well hopefully soon well let's go ahead we're gonna take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio when we come back we got more news to get into for part B tonight and we're gonna take your calls as well 1-877-GAME-OLR so stay tuned guys cuz we will be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio and welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening July the 5th of 2009 believe it or not we are halfway through the year I can't even believe it we are still of course taping live as we always do every week at all games radio www.allgames.com if you are listening live come join us in chat chat.orangeloungeradio.com I don't know why we use a separate chat from all games radio but we do we just always have because remember Orange Lounge Radio was its own station now is at this point many years ago I don't even remember when we pulled the plug on live 365 but it was a while ago now it's about a year and a half ago so we've been at all games radio ever since our our new home where we were syndicated for a while and now we're somewhat of an all-games exclusive but of course you can always get the podcast when I'm able to get it up to date and I apologize again that I'm not always current but I try to be please no it's not a anti podcast thing I promise anyway part B here we go we're gonna get to your mailbag and the FUs of the week and the release dates we got all sorts of stuff we should go still get a cover I'm sure though Loki has a little few more news stories for us I have tons of news stories and let's talk about a music game because that's what's awesome DJ Hero announced of course that they're gonna be I should say Activision announced the DJ Hero would contain Grandmaster Flash and not only will he be appearing in the game as himself and you know among the cast of other DJs that are in the game but he'll also be contributing to songs including one remix as Herbie Hancock rocket versus nerds lap dance and then also Grand Master Flash here comes my DJ and versus Gary Newman cars I'm all about DJ Hero I think this game looks awesome yes yes it looks really sweet I'm not surprised though that they're including the old you know some of the old the some of the deep famous DJ is kind of like they do in guitar here all right you have like slash shows up and you know buckethead and some of these people so it's pretty cool yeah so I'm very cool and you know just excited that we're gonna we're hearing more songs coming out of it um what else was I wanted to say about DJ Hero it's still gonna be extensive though of course is the only kind of outside but what do you do but the thing is though is it's the only game I'm buying this fall really out of all the stuff coming out this fall silly game I'm buying this fall because you can't pirate the the turntable I see how you know it really deserves my money but um yeah it's just you know with kids coming you know really honestly I mean piracy aside you know I'm probably not gonna be playing a lot of games in the fall we'll be playing the grant of thought oh expansion a new one but that's for sure but really with kids coming is just like I'll be lucky to play DJ Hero I hope we get DJ Samantha Ronson in the game though so we can have her girlfriend Lindsay Lohan or on again off again girlfriend make a cameo pretty awesome I think so yeah but is she any good has she actually made music I think she's a somewhat respected DJ I think it's more than just who her girlfriend is Sacramento not that long ago they were promoting it on the radio I don't know I had there's a lot joking I don't think she's a long list of other DJs I'd rather see in the game than her fine fine I try to make a silly little joke I know that's what I do like have we heard a lot about download content with DJ hero there will be some that's about all we know because I know someone actually I for whatever reason they have visited their website and actually looked at their Twitter and there was someone asking hey is there gonna be download content and they're like of course there's gonna be download content but not necessarily regularly like you see in rock band because guitar heroes download content seems to be a bit more sporadic yeah I'd be guessing that's gonna be a bit more sporadic Marissa congusto in our chat room chat that orange laundry calm says it could be a pixelated low hand tweeting naked pics that would be a true to life wouldn't it a little to do life all right what else you have for us lovey also of course not really something I would utilize and not really something you'd utilize anymore but Twitter has come to Warcraft thanks to tweet craft a in-game client that you can get you can now Twitter inside the confines of Warcraft this would actually be cool believe it or not if I was like a role player I think it would be kind of neat to have a character using a Twitter like create a character and have them tweet about the things they're doing in World of Warcraft and I think that's probably what most people use it for but I just hope it doesn't turn into this whole like oh I just turned in this quest oh I just dinged to level 77 oh we're running this instance anyone want to join because we don't really need to fill Twitter up with that garbage I hope none of my personal friends are you gonna use this for that but if they're using it to keep all the crack in their vein like they play World of War crack and have Twitter at the same time like I can also understand the need to have that crack all at once all they need now is Facebook as well in World of Warcraft if they don't already have it and then everybody's crack should be set I know according to the screen shot here it doesn't look like they're using it for roleplay in fact one of the people says thank God CNN's finally segueing from reporting on Michael Jackson's still being dead to reporting on what happened to bubbles the chimp nice formation we need to know right away I'm reading this stuff in chat which is great tiger class says great now you can tweet when you're in a wow raid SSJ 100 Matt says at Rob I just got a four strength force damn leather belt that's a all games inside joke I'll have you know frisbee says mom bathroom nice let's just encourage people to not have any human interaction whatsoever by putting Twitter in World of Warcraft exactly I'm not gonna say I'm glad I left because I'm not vindictive about the reasons I left but I am I'm I'm comfortable with my decision and you know that there's many other games to be playing right now and something although sorry I will say this I am kind of sad that I feel like some people I don't talk to anymore because I don't play World of Warcraft which is kind of sad I'm like just call me dude let's hang out let's do some besides rating hang out in World of Warcraft I know no it's something you may need if you really you're you know living the sedentary lifestyle hopefully I will never need this but there is a new DS plug-in that you can use with your DS and DS I because it actually plugs into the DS slot and not the you know the gameboy advanced lot but it is a a device called digit and it's for helping diabetic kids record their sugar levels so that they can see if they're okay you know it helps them test their sugar and I don't know so really you can turn your DS into a diabetic monitor now yeah it's a you know sugar glucose reader and it's I'm not sure if you can use this like well I'll tell you right now your insurance ain't gonna cover it so what you're gonna be paying for that out-of-pocket but I guess what it is probably it's like a diabetic monitor you know when you're diabetic you have to track you know this I'm you have to track your glucose several times a day it depends on how you know there's different stages of diabetes is a very common disease like Halle Berry has diabetes a lot of very famous people have diabetes you have to track your your sugar levels several points throughout the day and then it's you might be what they call insulin dependent or if your levels are really out of whack you have to inject yourself with insulin this monitor if they're encouraging kids to use this monitor there with their DS is probably a way to kind of track those levels but more so for their parents to look at it I bet is it's actually kind of a neat use of technology I actually think it's kind of a neat use of the DS this is this is a feel-good CNN good news story of the week type thing and intended in think of it first screw you vitality monitor alpha kenanagram in chat says Loki yeah this looks like bears ray rebranding of the glucose boy independent they look the same so I'm guessing bear about the tech from the guy that made glucose boy probably possibly who knows frisbee Aston chat where can I when can I have the Wii Fit glaucoma meter so I do think it's a pretty pretty neat idea hey look you brought up World of Warcraft earlier and I want to talk about this a little bit because I thought this story was very interesting having been in a game that was ruined by gold farming or in that particular game Gill farming the game was completely ruined by that although they have made a motion to fix it I'll give credit where credit is due but it came way too late anyhow there was just stories going crazy around the net this week that China had actually banned gold farming which is a huge industry in China it's what like 500 million dollar industry in China that it was banned this week which is huge news well I don't know if you're aware but not really that's not really what happened here's what China really banned was using virtual money for gambling and will be you know punished by you know public security authorities and miners cannot use cannot buy virtual money here's what it really comes down to is I think it's well a it's miners too it's not you know adults but also the fact that the real problem and and Richard Heeks who is a professor at the University of Manchester kind of breaks it down it's what it really is is using these fake currencies one of the big ones is called QQ coins used to buy real I know it's funny huh used to of QQ I don't have any real money using these QQ coins to pay for virtual game stuff apparently some folks were using them to pay for real things and that's what the law is to prevent using virtual currency to buy real products that's what it comes down to and most people are when you do gold farming that's the other way around you're paying real money for virtual items that's still okay it's the other way around that is now illegal which isn't going to impact any of the gold farming industry I'm sorry to say and that makes everyone go QQ exactly because the QQ dollars are still out there that's all I got that's funny do you think they should ban the real thing I don't know if they can that's where I'm at I'm like you know what why bother at this point it's out there it's up to the game makers I think to some extent to stop this shit if they want to really they if they really wanted to stop this crap they could but most don't and really you know as much as I see you know you know it it's not a good thing to buy money they're kind of doing the work and earning the money they're not really exploiting unless they're exploiting the game is cheap and get the money you know if they're earning the money in the game and there's someone out there it's desperate enough to pay for that money. I don't see the problem in that. I see the problem in if they're cheating to get the money and then it screws up the whole economy. Plus, it also depends on the game's design. Like, I don't think gold farming is that big of an epidemic in World of Warcraft. I know it's out there, I know it's being done, but in World of Warcraft it's not that hard to make money. They have dailies, they have ways to make money. Gold farming is for lazy people. If people are too lazy to make gold the hard way. Now here's the thing, in Final Fantasy XI, you couldn't make gil that easily. You could not make gil as easily as you can make money. And some would argue with me, you know, and that's just ridiculous. And again, I realize the game has changed an awful lot since I left. You know, now they have more things that are solo. I'm talking about the old Final Fantasy XI. Things that I hope Square has learned before Final Fantasy XIV, in other words, is that, you know, gil farming was an epidemic and it was killing the game. Because what would happen is, yeah, what was the only way to make gil? You camp these notorious monsters that would drop items that would be worth millions of gil. Well guess what? All the gold farmers are out there camping with you and they got good at it. But WoW doesn't have that as an epidemic. So, you know, finally, years later, they changed it in Final Fantasy where the items would bind a certain way. You know, it just took them too damn long to do it. Lessons, again, I hope they have learned moving into Final Fantasy XIV. Because Final Fantasy XIV has the potential to be amazing. Rama asked in our chat room, chat.orangemanstrategy.com, now with Final Fantasy XIV will they shut down Final Fantasy XI? Hardly. No. Will they have to do server consolidations and things of this sort? Probably. Will they lose players? Probably. But they'll probably charge more for Final Fantasy XIV. Not a lot more, but they'll probably charge like 1495 or 1595 a month. Because they could probably get away with it. So they won't care if people jump ship because they'll end up making more money off of them. I guess XI. It's actually... I had a lot of fun with it. I did too, you know, but I'll tell you what, Loki, I went back, tried to play again. It's just, you know, maybe if all the people were still there, which I don't think is gonna happen, it would be kind of cooler. But the way it is right now, I just... I don't have the time for an MMO anyway, so... But I'm looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV. I am definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV. I'm all over that shit. I'm not looking forward to it because I won't be able to play it, probably. Poor thing. What you can do, come over to my house. You can play. Just, you know, tell the wife you're coming over to hang out with Rob. We're gonna watch movies. Bring the kids! Get them into it. No, no, no, that, you know, I... Nellie doesn't want the kids playing video games. I mean, basically she doesn't want them ignoring homework to play the video games. Just fine. I understand that, because, you know what, I never did that. I always did my homework, and then, well, I most of the time did my homework, and I didn't really, you know, play video games. It wasn't an issue like that, but they're gonna play video games. They're, yeah, they're gonna play video games more than the other. I think what your wife hopefully already knows is that if you try to stop them from doing it, they're just going to want to do it more. So you just have to find a balance, is that you can play one out. You can use the TV for two hours. You want to watch cartoons. You want to play video games. Whatever the F you want to do on the TV. I wouldn't say that, obviously, but whatever the F, and me explaining it to you, whatever the F you want to do for the TV with two hours, that's yours. But either A, once your homework gets done first, or B, once your two hours is up, you better be doing your homework, or you're gonna lose your TV time, you know, something like that. That's the kind of system I think you have to do. Always homework first. Yes. Okay, let's talk a little bit about, wait, can I say, can I say, because this is obviously a sparked discussion in our chat room. I have to read this at chat.orangelandtrader.com. First off, about Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, SGA 100 Matt says they said they will continue to release expansion for Final Fantasy XI, and especially now that they're doing the download expansions now, like there's the MOG, the coup d'etat, or whatever they call it. What the hell is it called, the new Mughal one? The coup d'etat is coming out today, I think, is when it came out. They're doing the download ones now. They'll continue to do that. Just like EverQuest and EverQuest 2 is that I think, unlike EverQuest and EverQuest 2, I think you will see a lot more players on Final Fantasy XIV than XI. I think a lot of people who left XI are gonna come back for XIV. I think that will happen. Also, some comments on the babies. Tigerclaw says they're gonna play video games while parents are asleep. That's true. If the TV is in the kids room with the console, they're gonna play the video games while you sleep. TV is not gonna be in the kids room. GS68 says, from kindergarten through third grade, my parents would only let me play video games on weekends. And I'm thinking, you know, the kids can play not the new console games. They gotta play the old stuff, because it also is more family-friendly, you know, whereas the new stuff, you know, no playing Grand Theft Auto. Although, although with Grand Theft Auto, you know, I know enough about hacking that I could probably take out the blood and stuff. Marisa Congusto in chat says, my dad had a really good parenting strategy so I couldn't play too many video games. He played them so I couldn't. That's more like it. You should suggest that to the wife. I'm only playing video games so the kids can do their homework. I'm doing you a favor. Now cook dinner. Then she needs to learn how to play video games, I don't know. Alright. Yeah, you're gonna learn how to play video games or cook dinner. You need to play one or the other. She's gonna cook dinner because she hates video games. Or she'll play Animal Crossing for the rest of her life. To talk a little bit more about Sony PlayStation. You may remember, of course, they have their PlayStation Eye-based motion capture system that they're planning on using for some really retarded looking ice cream cone things. But there's apparently another tech thing that they, I guess, registered a patent for that's gonna utilize what looks like a giant square-shaped U-thing. Almost like the U-Force. You know, kind of scary enough, but apparently you would use this device in your hands, I guess, in replace, you know, to replace the cosmic ice cream cone thing. But you would use it, I guess, like a, you know, baseball bat or golf club or, you know, sword, whatever. That thing's gonna get broken. That thing looks retarded, if you ask me. Well, maybe it was just patented. That doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna use it. I don't know. Just a giant U of death. applicant anagram is saying that's just a random object, not a controller. That the U is supposed to represent some type of object the person has in their home. And that's what I had thought I'd read is something about that you can use this thing is supposed to be, like, so any object can be used in the game. Which is kind of similar. Isn't that similar to what Natal was saying, too? Yeah. It's gonna be able to scan, like, the kid's skateboard in a little preview. Okay, well that, yeah. So something similar here, right? That'll work as well as they show, but yeah. That's neat. I don't like the idea of those swinging around something that even resembles a baseball bat in my house, so. Unless it's a Nerf bat. Even then. Couldn't you just roll up a piece of paper and tell the game it's a bat? It would work, right? Roll up the newspaper, thunk. Couldn't I hold up the cat and say it's a baseball bat? How long is it gonna take before someone tries to use their penis on this? It's gonna happen. That's the age-old question about new peripherals. How long before a penis is used with it? How long? Try 30 seconds. That's the length of time to unzip and unzip the pants and undo the bell buckle. Scan this! Oh my god. Alright. Hey, look. We got some emails we got to read, so let's get to the mailbag. How's that sound? Mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com That's where you send your emails every week and we read some of our favorites here on the show. That's exactly what I'm gonna do right now. If the Star Stalker's not here tonight, I will read them. If you can scan its objects to be used as guns, you can have your own laser tag. Yes, whatever happened to laser cat the video game? You think with community games we would have this now? I'm surprised we don't. Somebody needs to get on that. Sorry, I had the music blaring that whole time. Mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com if you want to send us an email. Email. First email to us tonight comes from Rick and Rick sent us an email and the subject is Nintendo divorce notice. I would like to hereby make public my intention to divorce Nintendo after many faithful years of devotion to each and every Nintendo console that has been released. After investing many years of my life playing the great library of classic games including a substantial financial investment, I feel my relationship with the Wii is drawing to a close. We made it past the rough patch a few years ago with the GameCube and yes I admit I did cheat on Nintendo with Microsoft and bought an Xbox. I've already apologized for this affair. It's in the past we moved on. And then the Wii came along and life was good again. We had such good times together with Zelda, Metroid and Mario but there was something wrong, something nagging in the back of my mind. Could it be all the shovelware that was becoming more and more common? Could it be all the ported games with waggle attached for no fucking reason? Could it be last year's E3? Could it be all the party games? What's next? Motion control? Yaris? The answer to all these questions is yes. You just don't seem to be trying anymore Nintendo. Do you care? I waited and waited watching this year's E3 for a sign that you still cared but no you let me down yet again. Why should I stay? What can you offer me as a reason to hang around? Why shouldn't I just go and sell my Wii and put the money towards a PlayStation 3? More Mario Galaxy you lazy bastards that's just fat you trimmed from Galaxy One. Mario multiplayer ported from the DS. Zelda? A painting? A frickin poster? And they said the Zelda game actually is not gonna be very different than the first one which means it's gonna be raining on the same engine. I'm reading this poor man's please to the divorce court. A statement about no sword? That's it? Get fucked! Kid IKEA RS? Oh there oh it's there it's coming news flash we don't care anymore. At the end of the day I'm going to be a dad soon and my time will be a precious commodity. I need to know that you are taking things seriously if not I'm walking to the nearest Sony store. It's so sad. You used to try so hard and produce such wonderful gaming experiences. You were top of the pile now you're more bothered about coming on to my grandmother and small children. You disgust me Nintendo. Regards Rick. P.S. I get custody of the Nintendog. Well we will see how that holds up in divorce court with judge who is it in divorce court Judge Mabel? He's Judge Mabel. Of course if he's in the UK he's not even gonna get that joke so forget it. All right that was a well-written divorce letter and I can't say I it's tough it's tough being a hardcore gaming fan and watching what's going on with the Wii but at the same time I think he summed it up right at the end they're more interested in hitting on your grandmother and little children and they're doing a good job of it you can't deny that but you know we're just not the bread and butter for Nintendo anymore maybe Nintendo felt they already lost us between the 64 and the GameCube. I don't know. Well wait not to try. But my thought is a lot of us were children or at least younger when those systems were out I mean wouldn't you I don't know. The problem is they're kind of catering to stupid people but they think that people like they're oh my god you know games are so hard I can't play them well you give it to a kid you know he's gonna figure it out I mean I was a kid I figured out how to play video games you know it may not have been I may not have been good at it at first but it took time I had to practice get better and you know nowadays I think kids should do the same thing because if they're just immediately great at it then good that gives them a self-esteem boost but they still suck it's just the game is really easy. Now I'm looking in chat and some folks want the emailer to understand about Metroid Other M they neglected in their whole little statement there but J-Rod offered up this interesting retort I can think of at least three games from both Sony and Microsoft for me three that I want on day one Nintendo had one game during a two-hour conference. Yeah that is true so but I mean does look cool. Metroid M does look sweet. They just need like ten more of those. And here's the thing though okay is it looks cool but is it actually gonna be cool? We'll see we'll give them the benefit of the doubt we'll see but again they need ten of those. Yeah they really do need more hits throughout the year I mean because I'm sorry but you know people will probably be dumb enough to buy New Super Mario Brothers Wii because it's got Mario in the name and because some parents are like oh my god Mario I gotta buy it you know and they don't know anything about it could be Mario teaches Sudoku and they would probably buy that crap but I don't know. Email number two tonight of five emails we got a few to burn through tonight email number two comes to us from serious turtle this is a very serious turtle we need to take this very seriously guys a couple months ago I discovered podcast alley and thus your show I forgot we were listed on podcast alley that's an old-school podcast podcast exactly oh my lucky stars I've been needing a show like this my whole life I don't have any friends who are hardcore gamers like me so when I heard your show it was fantastic to hear people like me who talked about the things I care about thanks for all the time you invest in the show and tell Loki to stop yelling the turtle sorry I have a problem look this this serious turtle has it has a serious issue with you Loki and that is that you yell too damn much I got to talk to you that's something this is great oh no totally go on a tangent but oh alright funny fine so apparently earlier this week Nellie was convinced that I had Asperger's syndrome isn't that kind of like it's like autism okay so she so your wife thinks you're autistic yes yes because apparently people stricken with Asperger's they have the tendency to be very focused on certain things or whatever basically you know I piss her off a lot by like going on my computer and working on something for a while and not realizing what I'm doing not realizing it's making her angry and some of that and there is a lot of times that I do that and I don't realize it's making her angry I don't really cuz in my mind it justify like oh okay well I hung out with her quite a bit in stuff but you know I guess it's not the right time to be doing that or something like that or like all randomly blurred out stuff like like at your party or something there's people talking about something and somehow I found a way to work in games in there and I blurted out something completely random about like you know like they're talking about like some song may hear something, hey that song is in rock band you know it's supposed to be coming out in a few weeks on you know download content or something it's like no one cares but you know for whatever reason I feel compelled to do that all the time and I can't stop myself you just this show just isn't enough Loki you've spent seven years okay you've spent at least seven years of your life getting the gaming knowledge out there in a way this radio station is perfect for you I don't think it's as per I don't know go to a doctor and no no there's no it there's nothing that has to do that because it's actually you're very socially you know unable to cope with everything basically you can't well I think there's a function in society we're not medical professionals not even gonna try and get into it but it's you know it was funny because there's a lot of symptoms on there and they're like they're different work fields that would be perfect okay but look you go into web MD like yeah and you tell web MD you have certain symptoms I've got this and this and this this every time it tells you cancer every time you go in there and you're like oh I've got cancer I've got a rash on my ass and it kind of you know it flames love oh you have ass cancer you know like or like or yeah you're all yes or no it's not the Tuma anyway sorry to get off on tangent there I just thought it was funny all right next email yes please next email stop trying to talk about things you know nothing about all right this comes to us from death wishing I feel like I have not been involved in your shows for a long time have I missed a lot yes anyways now to get on with some email material have you guys ever heard of a game called urban terror well if you have not then there is no reason to not try the game because because well it's absolutely free it was originally a quake 3 mod and then went into its own standalone game I cannot describe how it plays but I guess it's a miss a miss I think a combination of counter-strike and quake hence it being a quake 3 mod well let's hope I don't miss the cast again I've never heard of this any urban terror so the only thing I've heard of there was a urban chaos or something like that game that was from idos or something that really sucked but that sounds kind of neat email number four from shook hi everyone I've been following this show for about three months and I can honestly say that this is the best video game related show I've ever listened to why thank you I encourage you guys to keep doing this show and if you're reading this on the seventh anniversary I wish to congratulate you on the feet well you're a week late but that's probably my fault because the seventh anniversary show still hasn't hit the feed but thank you nonetheless seventh anniversary or not we'll just say we'll say that's a pre grats for our eighth anniversary yeah there you go last email tonight from the one and only spazzinator hi everyone I thought I'd write this email for tonight show mainly to share a tidbit of info by the looks of things Sony will be doing three things more or less in tandem this summer rolling out the long rumor ps3 slim drop the price of the ps3 by an unknown amount and release firmware 3.0 which by most accounts will be a fairly big overhaul so I'm reading this email because we've addressed some of this but we didn't really talk about new firmware most sources agree that firmware 3.0 has certain features on it similar to what Xbox Live has reputation and griefing procedures as well as finally being able to download game updates in the background where there is still some debate as to whether or not firmware 3.0 will also incorporate the recently uncovered patented ps2 emulator that will supposedly work on all ps3s my suspicions are that the emulator will indeed be coming most likely in firmware 3.0 or at least in the next major from where to firmware update after that my reasoning is this there's no reason for any company Sony or any other one to patent anything unless they see a way to make money off of it directly or indirectly seeing as the PlayStation 3 sales have been lagging behind the Wii's in the 360s hell even the ps2s these moves that I've mentioned should in theory bolster sales which is ultimately what Sony and some third-party developers want ultimately this is all just hearsay educated guessing on my part until we see here something official however given my tracker record in as far as far as relaying info it's subsequently being true see a prior story I related regarding Capcom releasing games on PSN odds are this will be true proven true as well well that's a and it also bit of a it also makes sense to think about it kind of eases them into digital distribution with ps3 games because you have the ps2 games coming out now and I'm assuming those are gonna be at a higher price point than the PlayStation 1 games were you know for the most part I would assume that they're gonna be maybe around you know 15 20 15 to I would say even 15 to like $30 maybe 15 25 ish and if that does well then of course and I mean hey let's release some PlayStation 3 games you know for more money as well and see if we can get away with selling those so I'm not I'm pretty sure we'll probably see this stuff layers here all right well let me finish up this email here on a personal note I do hope that at least the emulator part is shown to be true me too although I used to have a 60 gigabyte model PlayStation 3 with full backwards compatibility I no longer had that due to unfortunate circumstances and was forced to settle for a non backwards compatible model hopefully this emulator will allow me to play my ps2 games again well thanks for taking this email it's appreciated and keep up the excellent work this email was brought to you by Loki's tingle costume which kindly asks him to wear it lol thus ends the email back tonight mailbag orange launcher calm if you have an email you want to send us in a future week sorry I think we'll cost him I do believe that you are about 800,000 copies shy in other words yes I made the costume yet you're gonna have to get to like 50,000 it's never gonna happen they've stopped making the game it's done it's not gonna happen done deal you need yet now all of you should be focusing on a new bet you can get low you know I am not making any bets on the PSP go I'm sorry I don't know that's gonna do because there are a lot of to be honest you know I have a problem with people buying the iPhone because I think it's retarded but you know there are people out there that like to spend a lot of money on stuff that's kind of you guys are gonna have to think really hard and also Frisbee brings up a good point Sackboy costume was better anyway let's not forget Loki did dress up as Sackboy which is pretty exactly I have the head now in my garage I know it scared the hell out of me when I first saw it all right some more news then we'll get into some release dates and the FUs of the week as well let's see here so let's talk a little bit about Xbox 360 we've got last M they've got some information on that and how will be integrated into the new Xbox experience apparently elastic last FM is gonna be free for gold subscribers however if you are still remember you do get to use three hours per month and if you're a I guess you'll have to shell out I guess another $36 a year if you're still remember and just want to use last FM which you might as well buy a fucking gold subscription points yeah might as well so apparently yes silver members will be able to access I guess trial period of three hours a month and comes with video advertising which might get into something else we'll talk about in just a second here and I thought is this isn't now my hope was that I'd be able to use last FM as my in-game music but that's not really what they're going for is it this is just gonna be like a cable channel or something I guess yeah I don't like the cable music channel instant party just add last FM or something I don't know like I've yet to really hear what is this used for I don't know I hope you can use like in-game music pretty cool that would be pretty cool actually is trying out you know the custom soundtracks with fuel the other day only two funny and it doesn't have the greatest soundtrack it really doesn't it's it's got what I like to call excite truck syndrome where you add new music to it instantly makes the game better you know yeah yeah so I don't know it it's alright but um I see I've never used last FM on PC so I don't really know if it's something that I'd be really excited about to be honest I mean I like listening to new music and discovering new artists and stuff but I don't think they have as eclectic tastes as I would have you know I don't know I guess I'll check it out I am a gold number so too bad it's not live through CC 5 instead of last FM I know right I'm saying something nice about life is CC 5 but seriously we might almost consider going back if they could have that on the Xbox marketplace how about we do shoutcast I know there you go how about shoutcast exactly then you can have all games radio on there and and which would include us of course and you know all the other great stations that come with shoutcast but I don't know maybe an IRC let's add IRC in there too and you won't need a PC you can just do it through the 360 exactly that's why I would love to have this show is be able to live I mean you can already hear it on your PSP which is cool but that's like one system out of a lot I guess it's one nice thing I could say about the PSP is that yeah by the way we wouldn't really go back to life this is five chat don't panic we're not really gonna do that besides you know what's funny is that since the show is actually kind of grown a little bit in numbers since we kind of combined with Bobby and we have some of the holdovers from his show and I know he gets a boost from us I don't think we could do the show on like these five anymore without being a professional station we have too many people which is a nice compliment certainly to you know the the listeners and the fact that the show has grown and we're very thankful for that we actually could not afford to do this show on like 365 anymore so don't worry that's not happening I was just making a bad joke sheesh so it's kind of surprising is to go off completely off topic from that Blizzard apparently is not gonna be including land support of course with the Starcraft 2 game oh I heard about this and a lot of people pissed off because you know land is I mean how Starcraft 2 and your Starcraft 1 and I think when you're like counter-strike I mean those are land games right there and you know I know land play is a huge thing especially land parties you know like Korea and stuff and the centers the land party centers exactly well I mean they still have play over there you know battle net stuff but I mean it's not the same so you can still have a land party it's just that you're all gonna have to have an internet connection yeah which in this Wi-Fi day and age shouldn't be that difficult but still it is kind of crazy I mean if you think about it let there is more lag I think involved with you know that because you're not just you're playing off of a local network but I don't know that kind of sucks but basically you know Blizzard's responding to the whole you removal of it because everyone was pissed off there we don't currently plan to support land play in Starcraft 2 as we are building battle net to be the ideal destination for multiplayer gaming with Starcraft 2 and feature Blizzard entertainment games while this was a difficult decision for us we felt that moving away from land play and directing players to our upgrade bell net service was the best option to ensure a quality multiplayer experience with Starcraft 2 and safeguard against piracy as she went under madam chat says hell I'm having a party next week and we intend on playing mass Starcraft via LAN you know here's the thing though here's the thing it's not like you can't still get everyone in a room together and play this game together you just have to do it on the internet which I know kind of sucks and they want they want to do that so that it validates your copy exactly they're trying to it's piracy yeah they're trying to curb someone's gonna create a client that's gonna act like battle net that you'll connect to that and you'll be able to play land with and guess who will be doing that the pirates because they'll figure out a way around this I kind of agree Blizzard ought to know better than this the that they're gonna take it out and someone's gonna find a way to put it back in you know what I mean it's it they might as well just put it in there and just encourage people to buy the game legitimately you know have one computer on the land sneak onto the internet and see if the other copies are validated certainly there's a way this could be done certainly like if one computer like creeps onto the internet battle net could somehow it's kind of tell I don't know I'm just crazy and of course you know everyone's pissed off and what happens when people get pissed off they start a petition and so they have a petition created you know that's basically insisting that blizzard ad land support back I can't wait for that question to be asked at this year's Blizzcon because that is one interesting thing about this story is that oops they maybe should have waited to say something about this until after Blizzcon but they said something about it before so what's gonna be awesome is that now there's gonna be these big panels on Starcraft then when they take questions why the hell did you take out land support you douche can't wait next question because we did next question no they'll say they'll get blah blah blah well we think the marketplace is shifting and we just wanted to encourage folks to use battle net so that they could track their achievements and everything is statistic based and if we do the land then we can't have that you're gonna get some talk around the answer just wait yeah just wait let's talk a little bit about the Dreamcast yes Dreamcast is of course getting yet another game and much like the other you know new games for the Dreamcast that have been coming out recently is another shmup game the brand-new 2d shoot-em-up game named ducks do you X and it's actually being sold I guess right now for $27.90 I'm not sure if it's gonna be a disk space game or not I guess it could be since you know Dreamcast can pretty much read any sort of burn disk and apparently I guess they have another game that's also coming out as well the company Hugh cast and it's I guess the title is last hope pink bullets which I guess was co-developed by the shins hmm which Wow not heard of any of these things apparently that's actually like the shins like the band the shins huh interesting but yeah I mean it's it's still nice to see I guess games coming out for the Dreamcast prequel all right well you know what guys I think it's time to I get into the F use of the week we wouldn't want to forget it this week so we got to get into the F use of the week and of course the story that inspires our angst this week this has to do with the case of the stolen we this week three teens Josh Carter and a 16 year old and a 13 year old were all arrested on felony charges this week because they stole their neighbors we well here's the thing the mother 41 year old Maxine law actually helped them get rid of the we at a local pawn shop she knew damn well the thing was stolen so they stole this thing from the neighbor and then the parents or the mom I should say parents mom helped them sell it off at a local pawn shop it was being reported by WF TV in Orlando the Maxine law will probably be charged with dealing in stolen property and contributing to the delinquency of minors you should know better you stupid that makes me angry low-key F use the week I guess F you did not have enough time to play games and being broke more or less I don't really have a lot of F use this week I'm generally feeling pretty good so I guess I would just also give an F you to not having enough hours in the day to play video games and F you to Facebook games for being so stupidly addicting alright let's move on with some more gaming news we got release dates to get to two will get to those in a little bit after another couple stories let's talk about some free games a free yes free is good and these are actually some pretty good free games both happen to be fighting games on the first one is a game called vanguard princess and I guess it's a 2d freeware fighter game developed by a looks like a Tomohaki Sugeno and apparently he is an ex cap com employee and the game looks pretty sweet actually you know definitely on par with like something like guilty gear even and that's available for download apparently off of a website www.vector.co.jp that's vector and just do a search for I guess vanguard princess and also the kind of go along with that is a game called dark presence and dark presence is a digitized fighting game very similar to the old Mortal Kombat games and like like Street Fighter the movie the game where they actually captured the the faces of people they're making a new game like this yes that is freaking awesome and actually I take that back this is not a not a free game but apparently new arcade game is not a new arcade game that's pretty awesome so wow that looks really crappy if it's an arcade game I don't know well I was reading something about like it's got more animation I guess than any game like it has ever existed so it's supposed to be a smoother looking game then you know the Mortal Kombat games were which I would hope you know I've been it has been many years the technology hopefully to me it looks like one of those cheesy like games that you would see in a movie or something like that when they're trying to create a game in the movie that you know supposed to represent like a Mortal Kombat type ish game you know something really low-budget but hey whatever if it comes out and turns out be cool you know hey Mortal Kombat at the time I think you know it looks sort of cheesy on a certain level so yeah more power to him all right let's get into release dates shall we we're gonna travel around the world now and talk about what is coming out around the world we're gonna start tonight with Japan's this is a release dates I have up right now coming out in Japan on July the 9th Major League Baseball 2009 comes to the Xbox 360 as well as WWE legends of WrestleMania also making its way to the 360 this coming week on July the 9th coming out on the PlayStation 3 siren gets a price drop into PlayStation 3's best series as well as WWE legends of WrestleMania also comes out on July the 9th moving on to some other systems we have on the Nintendo Wii I believe is next yes nothing really coming out this week in Japan the next big release Dragon Ball game coming out July 23rd but a little quiet for Wii games right now which is a little strange usually they're still pretty busy Major League Baseball 2009 also makes way the PlayStation 2 this week kind of not surprised though that a baseball release would be kind of the big thing in Japan this week you get some new peripherals for the DS some Disney character headphones coming out but otherwise there's really not a lot of new games coming out but there is a price drop coming out on hamster to coulda so comes out I'm sorry doesn't come out gets a price drop this week which is this happy hamster looking game no I was saying in ten dogs but it's hamsters they do look very cute though oh no sign of Richard Gere in the game by the way and then let's see on the PSP bleach gets a price reduction heat the soul five another port of Major League Baseball 2009 this week and yeah looks like this is a big week for baseball in Japan but otherwise nothing else to really note how about the u.s. u.s. there isn't really a lot of stuff coming out this week pretty much your big release is gonna be the bigs 2 which is coming out on PlayStation 2 ps3 Xbox 360 and the Wii and believe the PSP also this week we've got looks like oh the crappy game here huh and see that on there birthday party bash on the Wii which you know apparently it's a birthday party kit in the box I don't know if you're a mom maybe that might be interesting for a little birthday parties for your kids also this week we've got a port of a game that came out in the UK Sid the dummy which is a crash dummy game something that would have probably been popular like 20 years ago coming on PSP ps2 and the Wii we release a Bioshock and Elder Scrolls for oblivion kind of combined together in the bundle for PC and Xbox 360 the packaged version of Arma 2 coming on PC which is supposed to be pretty sweet memento mori on PC and then coming out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network this week battlefield 1943 also on we wear this week and PC the first chapter of the new tales of monkey island series tales of monkey island chapter 1 launch of the screaming narwhal which sounds pretty cool and also I believe trying is supposed to be coming out on ps3 as well on the PlayStation Network this week as well so not really a huge huge week no not really next week I mean July is really slow for game releases I think next week we've got like NCAA football 2010 so if you're in the college football that'd be good for you but it really not a lot of big stuff I think at the end of the month course king of fires 12 so that'd be cool this time of year is usually a little slow isn't it it's always slow a little bit hey how about the release dates over in Europe since star soccer is not here tonight allow me to say that in Europe you can look forward to some of the downloads that we get this week as well tales of monkey island woohoo battlefield battlefield 1943 as well in Europe this week but if you want some of the releases in stores cross edge comes out on PlayStation 3 this week as well as the conduit making its way to the Wii and trying to coming out on the PC again those are all for Europe this week there you go a couple more stories then we'll open up the skype line for you guys at 1 8 7 7 game olr to take your calls tonight on anything you want to talk about apparently according to Sesame Street video games are ok according to Sesame Street so as opposed to according to joystick or destructoid or Kotaku or one of the big game blogs this week it's according to Sesame Street yes apparently I see let's see apparently a game changer report issued by Joan Ganz Clooney Center from the Sesame Workshop basically says that governments the health care industry and schools should be spending less time hating on video games and their negative effort our native negative effects and said be conducting research on their positive effects on kids the port says that games not only can be educational but in this day and age active as well meaning they can be used everywhere from a history classroom to a PE class and of course you know they're all saying the Joan Ganz Clooney Center is to foster innovation and children's learning through digital media so that's their kind of did you hear that Jack Voldemort you listening and yeah that's kind of neat I hope we get a song about it that Elmo sings video games okay just do your homework then you can play hopefully Elmo will never have to explain to children what teabagging is in halo there's some contest there in there that I want to do about who can write the best Sesame Street song for something obscene in gaming nice oh my gosh gold anthro and chat says another reason that says me Street is awesome first the death episode and now video games kind of talking about something we talked about last week all right hey by the way speaking of media I don't know if you guys heard about this but apparently they want to make a movie out of asteroids yes ah the old-ass fucking game from 1979 that many of you know from the Atari 2600 asteroids Universal has somehow gotten the rights to make asteroids the Matthew Lopez is writing the script it's being produced by Lorenzo de Bonaventura who's I know produce some other stuff this is the weird thing apparently they're universal is making a lot of movies of some weird shit right now like they they have the rights to some Hasbro games like battleship in candy land are supposed to be coming movies as well yeah they picked up a lot of Hasbro stuff oh you know what where I've heard Lorenzo de Bonaventura before he's producing that GI Joe movie that's coming out next pretty big movie so it's not like these are no-name people but well you know pretty big movie but it's also gonna be a pretty big flop you think so then again then again transformers has a lot of horrible things going for it and it's still did very well so who knows by the way the script writer Matthew Lopez had wrote the movies bedtime stories and race to which mountain and is also wrote the most recent draft of the sorcerers apprentice there you have it I don't know about that you know I don't know as long as I mean where where's the movie in the game I think it there it's not even gonna have a damn thing to do with the game it's gonna be a space movie called asteroids whoop-dee-doo and what is it gonna be trying to be true oh my god I shot the asteroid and it turned into two smaller asteroids oh no quick shoot the UFO for bonus points it should be funnier for those space invaders tiger contest says there's already an asteroids movie it's called Armageddon yeah but Armageddon is actually like 10 years old now believe it or not it's kind of an old movie now and they did time for an update blow up the way to make it multiple asteroids leave yeah I guess that's true please no dancing animal crackers in the asteroids movie please no Ben Affleck thank you very much how about we have how many more stories you have maybe one more for the skype line two more I don't know I don't know let's do one more then we'll open up the skype line if you want to fill time with those stories we can okay let's see well I'm not really sad about this but apparently NetErosy is being shut down Sony is pulling the plug on the PlayStation 1 development community they're gonna still keep all the libraries and stuff online but I guess it's officially shut down but honestly they'll still developing stuff on the PlayStation 1 I mean then again I do say that in and there are people developing on the Dreamcast but you know what I think all the people that were developing for the PlayStation 1 should move to the Dreamcast you know because that's the one that seems to be you know supported the most and they have a lot of communities for that and stuff but well for what it's worth you can play a PlayStation 1 game on the PlayStation 3 at least there's that yeah but you can't actually you know publish any more PlayStation 1 games and really can only swap you know the games you make with the NetErosy with the other NetErosy users and I remember there was a time that actually wanted a NetErosy but that didn't happen I was about 15 years ago all right let's go to the phones they're ringing already one eight seven seven game olr if you'd like to be on the show tonight but in the meantime we have the call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the guy in East Coast with the fastest trigger Rama hi Rama how are you doing I'm pretty good pretty good what cons you go to this week to as I said the tiger claw I didn't go to any conventions this week I only do the ones are on East Coast I see and of course anime expos the big deal on the West Coast this week which by the way I should say something about this our staffer DJ tyrant Jimmy who used to host a show on our old network with DMN I keep this breast lol now they used to host a show together called STFU he writes for our website once in a while now he actually got some interviews at anime expo I believe we're gonna have the developers of blaze blue on next week in an interview he did so it's gonna be weird because it's not an interview we did but we're all about getting cool like statements from folks that develop games so I'm gonna kind of take a listen and and pick the parts we're gonna air next week and then you get the unedited version on the website there you go that's pretty cool but I will say this for the record ax is not a con it's a trade show it's a you know what I saw ads for anime Expo up here in Sacramento that's how huge that frickin thing is well they roll ads for New York anime festival here in New York and on on on Adult Swim I'm just saying it's considered a trade show because their board is consistent mostly people in the anime industry I see and they're mostly sponsoring the con itself so that it's not fan produced it's pretty much that's why Fana may always kind of puts that big fan that they really sell their thing on fan made fan produced for the past so many years yeah most cons I've gone to especially ones I've staffed and mostly fan based cool well that's cool yeah and I'm sorry I would say all the good cons are fan base but um e3 is pretty awesome for a trade show so trade shows aren't all bad anyway sorry oh no go ahead what else did you want to call in about tonight there's a few things that you spoke of tonight wanted to um throw back at you if you don't mind sure all right in response earlier about the Sony PSP go and the price as I've been saying in the chat room for the longest you're paying for the name not the product Sony has become the IBM of now cuz back in the 80s and 90s IBM machines were quite expensive but people bought his name IBM was on it but the only difference was at the time IBM made good quality product Sony not so much Sony is not Apple they need to realize that Apple can get away with that Sony can't I know cuz I don't know if you ever noticed um if you ever pick up like the Best Buy flyers or when Circuit City was still around in their flyers they're always pushing the ps3s with the Sony televisions if you bought the Sony TV and the ps3 $200 instant savings or if you bought that with rock band or guitar hero world tour you save $300 off the complete bundle hmm it's gotten to the point where Sony cannot sell the ps3 anyway in order for them to push them out they got a bundle it with something you know I'm reading some interesting comments from chat room chat that orange laundry calm j-rod and chat says I plan on buying a PSP go on day one that thing looks pimp as hell don't get me wrong I think the PSP go looks pretty cool but since I already have PSP there's just not enough in it for me I don't know I'm not feeling it for two and I would be all over that fucking thing if it was like 150 even exactly the same price as the current PSP I would be all over it but it's the it's that 250 it's ah I can't I can't do it I'm sorry mmm anyway I don't blame you seriously I don't yeah but you're Sony hater I'm just kidding no I just speak the truth you know that all right look anything else before I let you go and get some more callers two quick things number one at the we was all about motion control would have a shit ton of shovelware games on and as for Starcraft 2 you don't have a shit ton of shovelware games on it where have you been say what it does have a shit ton of shovelware games on it where have you been say if it wasn't for the fact that it was focused on the motion control there wouldn't be as much shovelware oh okay my bad my bad yeah gotcha I'm oh I've been told it's only like two games I own for the week every all the other ones I'd borrowed cuz you know yeah and what was the other thing I'm all about Starcraft you're not needing land support it doesn't cost that much to put in a internet connection a router and a 24 port switch to get everybody up and running together does it do you think it's really gonna have that same feeling though well if they do it where you log in via the application it shouldn't be that much of an issue because it milk I have the same lag time as if you're in the same room you know no depends on who's hosting or all that crap you know I guess true true all right well thanks for your thoughts Rama and good luck from later j-rod I wanted to clarify we were saying earlier he says I don't own a PSP so that's why it's probably so attractive to me yeah I'd be I'd probably be a little more about the PSP if I didn't already own one but still 250 I don't know hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello you're on orange hello hi who's this hi who is this is Marissa yes hi what's on your mind Marissa well thanks again I just had to say a belated congrats for last week I wasn't able to listen in although I heard it was a good show it was a pretty good show it sadly hasn't hit the podcast feed because I'm a lazy son of a bitch but it will be hitting it very soon and you guys can hear was that it was a kind of a little bit of a throwback to the old days it was cool yeah you know as far as my own gaming week this this fourth of July weekend consisted of watching Chris play Call of Duty and and how is that is this is this fun to watch just play you know actually for some reason it puts me to sleep I don't know what it is the sound of killing and bullets but I just curl up like a cat in front of his feet and I fall asleep all the sounds of murder just make me tired yeah I've actually distracted myself with that old you know you're talking about people doing doing you know making games for Dreamcast and whatnot no systems I distracted myself with Adam all the adventure game engine and was playing an alien race game oh yeah the one you linked me to that looks kind of freaky-deaky but tell us a little bit about this game alien rape escape or something if you know me I love all the old adventure games oh well how do you feel about the new monkey island game coming out I haven't even heard about that to you now so that's cool you know I never got into monkey island even I was younger you know I love a king's quest people and the quest for glory people get mad at me but and Indiana Jones or the state of Atlantis person but I try to remember that the state of Atlantis is going to be bundled with the new indie game whoo yeah that's right yeah I remember us reporting on the show a few weeks ago that it was gonna be coming on the Wii with the game or something like that someday I don't know if it was a pre-order it's been a while now but I I do I did hear that same thing on the show I'm still obsessing over the announcement now we made that a new feast is going to come out but I hadn't just praying every night that I don't fuck it up isn't how it always goes with old franchises though when they announce that there's a new one coming out you just pray that they're not gonna fuck it up yeah well I guess the thing is like one of those took over for looking glass although I didn't I actually like the X you know via the platform game the Xbox game at deadly shadows most of the purists didn't like it and it gets started out kind of lame because they called it a thief with a four instead of the odd or something and suddenly like that so it's like four four something now I don't know how to pronounce it but I guess it's just a working title indeed well Marissa I need to come visit us soon and come be on the show again I'm hoping that'll happen and you have anything else you want to share with listeners tonight before we get to some more calls nothing that wouldn't be sublimely silly so I have have a good night and hopefully I will be seeing you feeling and you need to call so-and-so all right we'll do honey take care I think I think we lost her there we go okay well I do hope Marissa comes back to visit it's been like a hundred episodes since she's been here she's a lot of fun I've been that long she's like it's I know we've been doing the show a fucking long time I don't know if you're aware we have another call coming on hi you're on orange launch radio oops we didn't really answer that call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this is fancy Nader hi spazz Nader what's on your mind tonight um two things which are kind of related to some degree go ahead all right you know I was you know you know you know thinking about that comment you were making about you know someone's making asteroids movie yes question is how the hell do you make a movie on the asteroid there's like no narratives there I mean I can I I can see a movie being here like I'm charted or no dear salad there's a narrative there but easy the same way the same way dude they're making movies out of battleship in candy land they are movies in name only or Pirates of the Caribbean there was really no plot to it you know in the ride but they managed to make three movies and they actually were pretty good now asteroid could be something similar where they just make up characters and then now those characters are associated with that franchise so and maybe that's what they want to do maybe it's type of agreement where if they could do a good movie then they can re-release the asteroid game with the characters in it just like they ended up going back and putting the characters in the ride or more importantly had huge amounts of merchandising with the parrot Pirates of the Caribbean movies I mean that the you know Jack Sparrow figures still sell like crazy and you see tons of them at Halloween you know he's a he's a universally loved character so I guess that's a good point I didn't even think about if they do write the movie well enough there there will be an audience for it but there's just not a lot of source material to base it off of what do we know about the asteroid movie it will be about asteroids there will probably be shooting of said asteroids that's it that's all the script requires in some ways it's guaranteed to piss people off less than like the Harry Potter movies like how many people hated the third Harry Potter movie because of all the shit they cut out sometimes it's nice to have a very thin narrative but I wouldn't you know I my expectations for this movie are not going to be I guess that high because of the fact there's no narrative to base it off of if that makes sense I don't know well it could very well be good you know for all I know obviously I haven't seen it so I can't be sure but you know I could be a little skeptical you know to say the least well we should be skeptical it's ten dollars and twenty five cents of our money we're gonna be spending on the movies anyway what was the other thing you want to mention tonight oh yeah I forgot to mention in my email because I can't really mention you know I wrote it but uh I kept it notes earlier earlier this week and on the PlayStation Network store the only time that the video site they got a reasonably new or new for the store enemy series that may be appealing to some of the listeners out there it's a devil may cry series mm-hmm and well I got popped up the first episode to try it out and for one thing it looks pretty good I don't know about the entire series as a whole but just based on the first episode it looks pretty good so I don't know if any of the listening wants to check it out or you guys but really start the first ones you know worth checking out you know that's one thing I have yet to do on the Sony marketplace is check out one of the TV shows or something but that's cool I know they've been kind of releasing some more anime and things like that sort of like there's a whole Street Fighter store now and on the PlayStation 3 I was checking out this week and they actually have like the Street Fighter anime and some of that stuff so kind of different yeah I think I mentioned in a previous email going back several weeks ago that I had recommended the first angel anime series I happen to have all 24 episodes and at least that series is very good it's kind of how to describe it's like a cross between actually has certain elements of specs files and a little bit of Charlie's Angels mixed in yeah it's kind of odd but in a good way definitely definitely worth checking out and that's a bit is that available on on Sony's marketplace yeah yeah it is I think I can't you know remember the name of the developer but you know it's not funimation right and that's for sure but it's pretty good all right I will definitely have to check that out on the marketplace at some point but thank you so much for the call spaz nator you have a good one we got to get some more calls but you take care later 1877 game olr username on skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call take maybe like one more call tonight I don't know if Lou he has any other stories you want to get out there before we take our last call let's see here now we got a call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this is excellent hi excellent what's on your mind buddy hey hey I have a quick question for you guys how can a developer bring out a PC version of a game that's really great and really good but yet have so many buggy and lot of cool issues it's not even funny to even start to mention how many stuff there is wrong with the game are you saying it's a PC game that came out yeah Ghostbusters a video game the PC version is absolutely horrid easy it's not I mean there's so many complaints from so many people they're not even issuing any patches or they're not issuing any kind of you know saying hey look we were sorry we're trying to get on this super duper super duper easy answer for you and what the one kind of problem that I suppose that PC games have in general is that there is not the same quality control that you have on the PlayStation or the Microsoft system or even the Nintendo system is that these games go through no quality control remember when way back when they used to have the Nintendo seal of quality yes the Nintendo seal quality had nothing to do with the fact whether the game was any good or not it just had to do with the fact that the game had been officially tested was officially licensed and approved for the system and usually the games that were like really prone to bugs and had really bad ingression a lot of really bad things wrong with them were these games that came out from color dreams and the other makers attention and makers that wanted nothing to do in Nintendo kind of moving on from that now you have a lot of these companies where you can't even really put the games out on the system unless you go through these rigid tests you know a quality control you know and it's it's little as you know in like the Xbox games you have to have you know things have to be referred to as the r1 and the l1 or the back button in the start button and then the Sony games the X button and O button you know that you have to make sure everything is referred to by the proper name for it I mean it's down to that kind of level of control on the PC who's there to control those games what third-party entity has to look at those games and and review them nobody nobody's really watching that I think it should be more viewing done because like I said before I feel now I'm they kind of gypped out of my money for the game and how they're looking actually forward to playing it on the PC and it's like now to go out and find a way to get it for either the 360 now or the ps3 in full quality and tour you know to play it till they come out some kind of patch you know and it's just like I mean there's been more than one more than one instance with more than one person saying hey look there's these kind of problems I'm running on a you know high-end system and yet it's still running like it's on a 386 computer so it's like what's going on here so interesting comment from Xenocore in the chat room I want to kind of run this by you there is no way an all-encompassing quality control can be run on PC games there are way too many combinations for hardware you can check all you want and still find bugs after release I didn't have any issues running Ghostbusters but it does it done have secure on it however good point is that you know when on the PlayStation on the Xbox at least you have the same hardware so there is something to kind of but but you don't know what components are going to go into those PC games so how can you really audit them I always thought the games for Windows was kind of one of those types of things was a way to have the game's quality controlled but I guess he brings up a good point you can't really test every hardware combination out there but yeah it's true that's very true and I just I was kind of weird because like I said I play Fallout 3 and everyone's perfect I have no problems or anything whatsoever I played this and it's like the whole thing is getting ready to crash at given points it's like I just thought was kind of interesting I just well I'm sorry here the game runs like crap x-link I would still continue to pressure the developers professionally you know write a letter post on the forums what have you get you know the other people you know they've been having problems of the game to continue to helm them and you know say you're not going to support them in the future if they don't fix their crap most definitely I hear you I hear on that excellent good luck buddy and take care okay thank you no problem thank you but bye and Xenocore in chat kind of makes a good point to secure on games kind of have a reputation for running like crap that's something important to state as well so I think we are gonna go ahead and wrap up the skyline for tonight I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through but we do want to wrap up and get out of here before it's too late tonight it's already getting close to nine o'clock midnight on the East Coast do you have any other quick stories one to get out there Loki yeah that's a quick stuff real quick there is a website apparently it's a book project that this guy's doing called there will be brawl and it's the artist names Greg death Greg DeStefano and you can look at the pictures that they have there on www. Greg DeStefano.com that's g-r-e-g-d-e-s-t-e-f-a-n-o.com and they've got some pretty interesting pictures sadly enough that Icarus guy looks like Shane that's kind of funny and wait let me see let me see it's sort of he maybe if Shane took hardcore drugs how about a Wario's John Goodman yeah sort of okay that I see a little more yes okay there you go but yeah it's interesting and then other things there's some cool rumors going on including that there's gonna be some little big planet download content coming soon themed after the Ghostbusters actually this is probably less of a rumor because it's actually on media molecules website and they have just in white text on black background who you gonna call and of course that's from Ghostbusters so makes perfect sense that will probably seen some stuff pretty soon from that probably just costumes though the Hanabi festival is coming back in Europe and there's actually a pretty good lineup of games coming with that including I saw they had an ogre battle which is pretty cool ogre battle from the Super Nintendo pulse man from the Sega Mega Drive bomber man 94 on turbo graphics 16 detonate twin be on also the turbo graphics Kirby's dreamland 3 on Super Nintendo Musha on Sega Mega Drive smash table tennis on the NES and zodas revenge star tropics to all these coming to virtual console during the month of July and yes that's kind of neat yeah so that's pretty awesome Star Trek Star Trek star tropics to never come out over there no I guess not interesting over here yes there no so that's starting actually as of last Friday so some of that stuff's already out and dark soccer would be all over that to Tana Twimby coming out I know she was a fan of that yes so that's pretty cool um Konami a guest is also confirmed that they're gonna be porting over contra rebirth for Europe in August and also drift mania with two eyes also coming to we wear as well so you drift drift mania I guess that's how you pronounce that top-down racing game and you know those are coming to Europe so that means that they're localizing it for English so hopefully we'll see those over here as well this is kind of a neat rumor apparently TMNT smash-up is going to be getting some other characters that aren't necessarily in the Ninja Turtles universe apparently they're also going to be getting two rabid characters one of them is rumored to be dressed up as Sam Fisher from of course the splinter cell series and then also rabid dressed up as a cheerleader and those are supposed to be in you know the all-term Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighting game which is kind of interesting that's some more characters they're shown for that and it's actually some stuff from the comic that I'm not even familiar with and then lastly I just have to mention this because I remember this when I had a graphing calculator in high school that they were trying to port this to the TI-83 but finally Link's Awakening has been ported to the TI-83 oh my god and it's been that long that I've been waiting you know I remember this coming out and it's like oh my god Link's Awakening we can play it on the TI-83 but really like those little graphing calculators can handle the processing they can have you show me the video they can hack them so that it's an assembly and stuff I guess it's awful sound quality but uh you know the you know graphics are just it's okay the graphics are kind of crap but well I mean it's a graphic and it's slow but yeah it's a graphing calculator running the game that's crazy and I think that a lot of the stuff they probably just programmed from scratch I don't think it's actually being emulated yeah I can't imagine this is any fun to actually play this is just more of an accomplishment than anything else but yeah I mean I remember you know back in the day it used to be you know this is back when they first started porting a like assembly stuff to the TI-85 and you can hack the calculator to run faster than it normally could and you could do grayscale games and stuff like that the days this is why I quit my calculus class because I was too busy programming games nice but uh yeah and that's all I have right now all right wow we're made it we're to the end of the show I know it's a little earlier than last week but we're kind of at the end of the show and that's okay cuz I don't know about you guys but after this holiday weekend I still have some things I'm trying to take care of before I go back to work tomorrow after this whole three-day work weekend so yeah we're gonna go ahead and wrap things up and get on out of here for the night but thank you guys so much for listening tonight and sadly dark soccer is not here either and you know she'll usually help banter with us for a little while and bring her stories to table she's not here so I think it's gonna be the end of the show believe it or not we're done we're out of here which is also actually it's good because it gives me a chance to make sure I can get on the network and get those other get the files that I need to upload the show later this week because I don't want the podcast people have to wait any longer so we're out of here believe it or not that's it have a great night everybody let's go around everybody's final thoughts Loki your final thought my final thought is I'm watching and someone actually took a DS light and they've managed to turn it into an arcade cabinet or I should say put a DS in an arcade cabinet that's crazy Wow my final thought is instead of spending $400 on a laptop I should have just bought myself an arcade cabinet for my house I would have been fun the real love that you know in hindsight like I said I think before I rather bought see because we're in an apartment complex in order to have the whole thing delivered it comes on a pallet and I mean you can't deliver a pallet of stuff to an apartment complex you're gonna get people looking at you funny and but man that would have been the way I've gone it costs like a sixth of what I paid for it and just you know looks so much nicer all right that's it guys thank you so much for tuning into our show tonight thank you for
