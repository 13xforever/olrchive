0	20000	Tonight, July 19th, 2009, Dragon Quest IX might get DLC as it sells oodles of copies.
20000	23520	Could your mall soon get a Microsoft Store next to the Apple Store?
23520	29760	And Capcom finally admits something we've always known about Street Fighter IV.
29760	35760	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35760	41760	We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41760	47760	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me every week are the awesome co-hosts that help make up OLR with me,
47760	49760	the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49760	51760	Greetings and salutations.
51760	53760	How are you, Miss Summers?
53760	55760	In pain. Lots of it.
55760	58760	Me too this week. I know you've got your hand thing going on, but oh my god.
58760	60760	But Vicodin makes it better.
60760	62760	Vicodin does make it better. I wish Vicodin made heat stroke better.
62760	69760	Vicodin, however, means I cannot drink the delicious bottle of wine that's sitting on my counter in the kitchen.
69760	74760	But I can! No, it'll make my heat thing worse. I'll explain that in a minute.
74760	76760	Well, you're welcome to as much lemonade as you like.
76760	79760	I appreciate that. Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
79760	80760	Hello.
80760	81760	How are you doing, Loki?
81760	82760	Fine.
82760	84760	Excellent. And how are you holding up in the heat?
84760	89760	Are you a healthy individual this week? Have you been sick at all? Have any surgeries we need to know about?
89760	90760	I got a little sunburned.
90760	94760	I was going to say, you look a little sunburned on your arm. Did you go out shooting guns again today?
94760	101760	No, I had to go. As part of my company crap, I was too lazy to say no,
101760	106760	so I had to go volunteer at this place called the Grace Foundation.
106760	110760	They rescue horses and stuff, and I had to go stay in a fence.
110760	113760	Wait, wait, wait. You volunteered for horses this week?
113760	122760	No, what it is, is I forgot to say no to volunteering, you know, painting fences in 100 degree weather by the way, you know.
122760	125760	That's awfully kind of you, though. You're a good person.
125760	127760	Dark Soccer's offering aloe vera.
127760	128760	Oh, I don't need that.
128760	132760	You know what? I have some aloe vera at home that's awesome because it's from Canada,
132760	137760	and they have different drugs up there that you can get at the drug store you can't get here because Canadians rock.
137760	138760	Love you, Canada.
138760	143760	But they have this aloe vera gel that comes with lidocaine in it, which is the same stuff that dentists will use to numb your teeth.
143760	144760	Cool.
144760	146760	It's like prescription strength over here.
146760	148760	You can also get it with benzocaine, though.
148760	149760	It's true.
149760	150760	It's my arm's red. That's it.
150760	157760	Alright. Anyhow, moving on to the show tonight. Yeah, it's 108 degrees here in Sacramento where we tape our show.
157760	163760	Now, Dark Soccer's little room that we tape the show in is pretty nice. I mean, it's not like it's 108 degrees in here.
163760	169760	But, man, you take one step outside, you feel like you're going to just die, just melt like the Wicked Witch of the West.
169760	176760	I've been going outside today because I've taken it upon myself to cleanse the throne of Shermie.
176760	179760	Not the one that's under the desk, by the way.
179760	189760	She has a very large cat box, and we keep it in a closet in the bathroom when the bottom of the door is sawed off so that Shermie has her own private area.
189760	194760	Well, four years of concentrated cat can create a bit of a stink.
194760	204760	So the box is getting sterilized. It's sitting outside with that green spray on it in the front yard on the porch.
204760	209760	And I got on my hands and knees and scrubbed out the bottom of the closet.
209760	212760	And Shermie's bathroom is freaking clean.
212760	213760	Well, congrats.
213760	218760	But I've had to go out and spray down her big old litter box today.
218760	225760	To answer some questions from chat, and of course we always have the fourth guest on our show, the chat room, chat.orangelaundryday.com.
225760	230760	Fear of the Claw starts off with, what's the Vicodin for? Why is Jamie on it? I missed a couple episodes.
230760	232760	She had hand surgery, right?
232760	236760	Yeah, I had trigger finger release surgery.
236760	243760	So if you want to, I'm not going to explain it again, if you guys want to know what it is, it's online on many, many websites.
243760	245760	And I think she explained it a couple episodes back.
245760	247760	I'll put something in the chat room.
247760	250760	The podcast is lagging an episode behind, which is totally my fault.
250760	254760	Like a dummy, I ran out of here last week and left the USB drive in the computer.
254760	259760	And I never had a chance to get back home, or come back over here and grab the USB drive.
259760	263760	Because Jamie lives a good 30 minutes from me, get the USB stick and upload the show.
263760	266760	So hopefully last week's show will finally hit the podcast feed tonight.
266760	269760	And I apologize, I know people miss it when we don't get the show up on time.
269760	275760	But I wasn't home. I have not slept in my own bed since Wednesday night.
275760	279760	That's how on the go I've been lately, which, you know, I can't complain.
279760	283760	Life is good, but just busy, busy, busy with all my different commitments.
283760	291760	So, anyhow, let's see, moving on, looking at chat comments, commenting on the temperature.
291760	295760	I'm also about to post the link for what trigger finger release surgery is.
295760	297760	There you go, if you want to educate yourself.
297760	299760	Alright, well let's get into our game of weeks.
299760	300760	Wow, I found a video of it.
300760	304760	Ew, don't, see here's the thing, I do not do well with blood squeamishness.
304760	306760	You know what's actually really funny?
306760	313760	Like, I don't mind Mortal Kombat type of games or Trauma Center or all the fake cartoon blood.
313760	318760	I have a very good mind that can distinguish, you know, as I'm sure a lot of you do,
318760	320760	that can distinguish fake blood from real blood.
320760	325760	Even horror movies, even though I've gone into a rant on this show before,
325760	327760	I don't want to get into it again, but you know I hate the Saw movies,
327760	329760	and a lot of that has to do with the violence.
329760	331760	It's not that the violence makes me ill,
331760	336760	but okay, that kind of violence is, you know, I can handle all that stuff fine.
336760	341760	It's real blood and the real cuts that I see in people's hands.
341760	345760	Like Jamie tried to show me the scar from her surgery, which you know is cool,
345760	347760	and I realize there's a lot of people that, you know,
347760	350760	are the types of people that will watch real trauma in the ER and Discovery Channel and all that.
350760	352760	They're like, cool, surgeries.
352760	355760	I want to barf when I see that kind of stuff.
355760	356760	Mine wasn't that bad.
356760	360760	But for me, like, I just get really grossed out by blood and cuts and everything.
360760	363760	I'm very proud of you then for looking at the one that I did myself.
363760	366760	Well, thank you, but still, I just wanted to barf.
366760	368760	You remember when that exhibit was coming through town?
368760	369760	I wanted to go to that.
369760	373760	The bodies revealed that they were advertising on the radio for like six months.
373760	378760	This is basically all these corpses that they've opened up so you can see everything.
378760	379760	No, it's actually really cool because what they've done,
379760	385760	they've actually set them in everyday poses like in office positions or in play positions
385760	387760	so that you could see the way that the muscles.
387760	389760	But they're people.
389760	392760	They donated themselves, however.
392760	396760	I don't think that they knew they were going to be donated for an exhibit.
396760	397760	I know.
397760	398760	I can't deal with it.
398760	404760	They're donated for scientific research, and I think, well, as a massage therapist,
404760	411760	I wanted to see it because for, now, I'll tell you the biggest thing that got me over my gross factor with bodies
411760	414760	is watching cadaver videos.
414760	418760	And once you see muscles moving on their own, it's sort of.
418760	421760	I'm going to barf.
421760	422760	I'm sorry.
422760	423760	Just not the type of stuff I'm into.
423760	424760	Puppies, kittens.
424760	425760	Yay, kittens.
425760	426760	I love kittens.
426760	427760	Yay.
427760	429760	Laying inside the corpses of the dead.
429760	432760	I hate you.
432760	433760	But yeah, I don't get.
433760	436760	Video games, Mortal Kombat, ripping heads off, hee hee, funny.
436760	437760	I love that shit.
437760	439760	It's the real stuff.
439760	441760	My brain can totally tell the difference.
441760	442760	Fake blood in movies I hate.
442760	444760	Other people's blood I hate.
444760	446760	My own, I have no freaking problem with it.
446760	447760	Oh, even my own.
447760	451760	He would not let me watch my surgery, but he did let me watch them do the anesthetic.
451760	452760	Hey, Jeremy.
452760	456760	It took me a lot to look at the pictures of what it looked like,
456760	459760	because they showed me a picture of my gallbladder before and after.
459760	463760	Like, they actually put the laparoscopic camera in there when I had my surgery last October.
463760	466760	They actually showed the pictures of what my inside looked like with and without it.
466760	469760	It took me like four days before I was ready to look at that picture.
469760	472760	And then when I finally did, I was like, I looked at it,
472760	476760	and then I kind of like cocked my head to the side like a kitten looking at the TV or something
476760	478760	and then looked at it for about ten more seconds and I was like,
478760	480760	oh my god, I'm going to barf.
480760	481760	Hey, Jeremy.
481760	482760	I never looked at it again.
482760	483760	It's gross.
483760	484760	Jeremy would not say anything for everybody, by the way.
484760	486760	She's a little Mike shy today.
486760	488760	She also needs a bath.
488760	492760	Anyhow, I don't want to talk anymore about internal body organs and stuff like that,
492760	498760	unless it's in a video games, which, by the way, it just blows my mind.
498760	501760	You know, when I hear this stuff about he who shall not be named,
501760	506760	you know, Jack Voldemort, the once lawyer from Florida who is, you know, a total attention whore.
506760	507760	The freaking loser.
507760	511760	Who, yeah, always talks about, you know, how video games lead to real violence.
511760	513760	I'm like, can't people tell the difference?
513760	516760	I really don't have a problem being able to distinguish the two.
516760	521760	I have a physical reaction to the real stuff as compared to the fake stuff.
521760	523760	Are you telling me a lot of people don't have that?
523760	524760	I didn't see that episode of bullshit.
524760	525760	I know. I heard about it.
525760	526760	It's up on YouTube apparently.
526760	527760	Oh my god.
527760	528760	I'm going to have to watch that because I love bullshit.
528760	533760	They actually did one debunking the video game violence myth.
533760	535760	Like, you know, we haven't already.
535760	536760	Am I crazy?
536760	539760	Is there anyone in chat like me, because I see a lot of people going,
539760	543760	oh, I went to that exhibit or, oh, cool, I think those exhibits are neat
543760	545760	or I couldn't believe that they were real people.
545760	548760	Is anyone like me or am I just a big pussy?
548760	550760	That's fine. I can admit it.
550760	552760	It's really nothing.
552760	554760	There's a lot of people who have that problem.
554760	556760	I mean, it's just the way you're wired.
556760	559760	I didn't know that exhibit was there, otherwise I probably would have gone.
559760	562760	I really wanted to go. I just couldn't afford it at the time.
562760	565760	Actually, no, I wouldn't have wanted to go because it's an art exhibit
565760	567760	and that's just, I don't know.
567760	570760	If they could bring the exhibit to me, then maybe.
570760	572760	Yay, I hear Golden Anthros has me, Sky.
572760	573760	Good, I'm not alone. Thank you.
573760	574760	By the way.
574760	575760	What?
575760	577760	My brother Phillip has now added me on Facebook.
577760	580760	My mother and my stepfather have added me on Facebook.
580760	584760	Why is my family suddenly becoming technologically with the times?
584760	587760	I need to figure out how to set up those filters on Facebook
587760	589760	because I'm getting more and more co-workers on Facebook,
589760	592760	which, you know, just my work life is very different from my personal life.
592760	594760	It's nothing personal, it's just.
594760	595760	Don't worry.
595760	598760	Facebook will eventually be phased out or replaced by something else that's grander.
598760	599760	I'm sure.
599760	603760	Soon enough, it'll happen and everybody won't realize it until, you know,
603760	606760	the news reports on it, like, retarded people.
606760	609760	Technically, he didn't add me. He actually came up as a suggestion.
609760	614760	But my mom, my uncle, and my stepfather have added me all on Facebook.
614760	615760	Wow.
615760	619760	So my mom actually now knows that I am just as potty-mouthed as she is.
619760	620760	You know I'm probably potty-mouthed.
620760	622760	Completely off topic here.
622760	624760	Oh, what else is new here on Orange Laundry?
624760	631760	No, well, it's on the show. It's about the show, but not necessarily on topic with corpses and...
631760	633760	That's fine. Let's move on.
633760	637760	As you can see, I found a hard drive lying around the other day.
637760	640760	And I decided to look on it.
640760	646760	I think it was the old hard drive out of my computer that was, you know, the arcade cabinet.
646760	649760	But it had some of the old shows on it from I don't know when.
649760	653760	I didn't even listen to any of them, but they're older shows.
653760	654760	Really?
654760	658760	Do you have, like, it might be the drive that we used to have that had, like,
658760	660760	Episode 1 and all the really old shows on it.
660760	661760	It might be that drive.
661760	662760	They weren't even numbered. They just had dates on them.
662760	665760	Those are the old shows. Dude, that's the drive that has Episode 1 on it.
665760	666760	Yeah, it was still good.
666760	669760	Holy crap! Hook that drive up. Can you get me a backup of what's on that drive?
669760	671760	Well, I already backed it all up to my computer.
671760	674760	Can you get me a... can you bring me a DVD of the files?
674760	678760	Because we've had the listeners, like, begging for Episode 1 for, like, years.
678760	680760	God, that's why I had to pick a bad migraine.
680760	683760	That was before... because we didn't think the show was going to last a year back then.
683760	686760	So we just labeled them all with the actual dates.
686760	689760	We didn't start numbering them until, like, Episode 40 or something.
689760	690760	Yeah, so that's why I have...
690760	691760	Holy crap!
691760	692760	I don't know if it's, you know, the first ones.
692760	697760	I just, you know, I... there's no year on it, so I was like, eh, I don't know when these are from.
697760	699760	It's... dude, it's the first year of the show.
699760	700760	Oh, okay.
700760	702760	Well, you need to put that stuff up in the archive that we have online.
702760	705760	I also found all my MAME ROMs on there. I was like, sweet!
705760	711760	Nice. Well, cool. Hook up that drive. Let's make sure... before we get the listeners too excited, let's...
711760	713760	It completely works, too. I don't know why it stopped working on yours.
713760	714760	That's awesome.
714760	717760	But it works... it is partitioned, like, six times, though. It's kind of weird.
717760	718760	Sweet.
718760	722760	Alright, well, we'll hook that up, guys. Everybody in chat's going, yay!
722760	723760	Alright.
723760	727760	I tell you, we need to do the big DVD.
727760	729760	I know. Now we can, with all the old stuff.
729760	734760	Anyway, let's move on to this week's news and what's happening now seven years later since those shows that Loki found.
734760	735760	What have we been playing, also?
735760	736760	That's right, our gaming week.
736760	737760	Yes.
737760	738760	Yes.
738760	742760	So, Dark Sakura, start us out. Loki's, like, excited to talk about something, I think.
742760	744760	No, I'm not. I haven't done any.
744760	746760	Okay, Dark Sakura, what have you been playing this week?
746760	749760	A lot of Sims 3, because that's really all I can play.
749760	759760	And the fortunate thing is that my mouse is one of the thumb track balls, so it keeps my hand in a neutral position, and it doesn't really hurt so much, so I've been playing a lot of that.
759760	764760	I tried playing some pinball, but, yeah, that didn't quite work.
764760	780760	Also, I downloaded Loom last week on Steam, and I was gonna play that, and I loaded it up, and then I was like, oh, wait, I have to do stuff, so I didn't play it, but I do have it now.
780760	783760	That's really about it. What did you do?
783760	788760	This week, I played Grand Theft Auto 4, the modified version that I'm still playing.
788760	801760	I finally got it down to the point where we tweaked a few more things, and we're at a point where we can kind of stop messing with it for a while, until I find something really cool to do with it.
801760	807760	But, yeah, it's been pretty fun. Very crazy. You're probably pissing a lot of people off because I keep winning.
807760	817760	But that's not on purpose. I mean, it's just, I've adapted to the new weapons pretty quick, and they forget that some of the weapons explode on contact with helicopters or flying cars.
817760	821760	And, you know, different strategies and whatnot.
821760	832760	But it's actually been pretty fun, and like I said, I think last week I'm planning on filming it, and I finally found all my video capture stuff, so I will actually try it.
832760	841760	The only thing I have to see is if my laptop will actually take that video capture stuff, because my laptop's relatively new, but not new enough for me.
841760	847760	It's not dual core or anything, so I have to see if it will actually be able to keep up with it.
847760	854760	Plus, I found some other device that will actually capture in HD, which is pretty cool, so maybe I'll have to pick that up later on.
854760	865760	But, yeah, that's really all I played. I have a bunch of stuff sitting around like I should have been playing, but I've been busy working on the house and working on other things.
865760	871760	But, yeah, it's basically Grand Theft Auto is the only thing I had time for.
871760	872760	Alright.
872760	876760	Oh, I watched Jim play RPG Maker 3, which is kind of funny.
876760	883760	Oh, yeah, that's right. I saw the RPG Maker 3 on PlayStation 2. That game seems very intricate for a PlayStation 2 game.
883760	885760	There's a lot that you can do with it.
885760	888760	You should have seen the old RPG Makers SNES ones.
888760	892760	I'm surprised they don't have a new one out on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
892760	893760	They aren't that popular.
893760	895760	Sadly enough, they didn't sell well.
895760	902760	I remember selling RPG Maker 3, and I thought, oh my god, this is fucking awesome, but no one seemed to get it.
902760	904760	No one really likes to do anything they actually have to work at.
904760	905760	It's a very cult kind of game.
905760	908760	It is tough, and especially with, like, it's not...
908760	914760	I like to say, like, ZZT would be pretty awesome, but ZZT, the only difference between that and like this,
914760	919760	ZZT's game actually was pretty good, you know, the standalone game that came with it.
919760	926760	You know, it didn't really show you how to make levels and stuff like that, but it kind of, you could, you know, look at it and stuff.
926760	932760	But, you know, that also had a really powerful editor with it, whereas RPG Maker 3, they have a really crappy game that's with it.
932760	936760	It's not very polished. It's just kind of, hey, look, here's what you can do with the engine. Done.
936760	940760	Wouldn't you expect, though, that somebody's going to bring in RPG Maker, especially the PlayStation 3?
940760	942760	Because look at, you've got your little big planet.
942760	946760	You've got your motor. What's the kart racing game that's coming out on PlayStation 3?
946760	947760	Mod Nation.
947760	948760	Mod Nation. Thank you.
948760	954760	If you had these kind of games coming out that are about creating and sharing a community, wouldn't it seem logical that a role-playing game's going to come out at some point?
954760	958760	They should. It would be cool. But they probably won't.
958760	964760	Because it really, I mean, they've had a few of them come out in Japan and they just haven't really taken off.
964760	968760	And even the company that used to make them on PC, like, went out of business.
968760	977760	And now it's being kind of carried on with, like, people modding the, you know, actual files and doing, like, freeware updates and stuff like that.
977760	978760	All right. Well, is that it for your gaming week?
978760	979760	Yep.
979760	982760	Actually, funny enough, most of my gaming this week has been on the Wii.
982760	985760	I've played two new games on the Wii this week.
985760	990760	First off was a download title that I checked out on Monday called BitBoy was the name of the game.
990760	1002760	What a cool concept BitBoy has is that you kind of play this game that traverses through an Atari 2600-style game through a Nintendo-style game to a Super Nintendo game.
1002760	1008760	Then it's, like, more of like a PlayStation or Saturn kind of game, which is weird because there was no Nintendo system right there.
1008760	1016760	And then a 64-bit game, like Nintendo 64, all the way to a 128-bit game, which is, I guess, their Nintendo Wii version.
1016760	1023760	And it's kind of like you play the 4-bit game until you, you know, beat it.
1023760	1025760	And then you get upgraded to the 8-bit game, which you play through.
1025760	1029760	Kind of a neat concept, and that's what sold me on the game, is I was like, oh, it's cool.
1029760	1032760	You can kind of move from one, you know, type of game to the other.
1032760	1033760	It sounds like a lot of fun.
1033760	1036760	It does, doesn't it? Here's the thing. The game sucks.
1036760	1040760	There's no nice way to say this. This game is horrible.
1040760	1049760	And I feel really bad saying that because I'm sure this was created by an independent developer studio and some of these people took a lot of time and put energy into this game.
1049760	1056760	But it's not worth your money because I think somewhere they got lost in the concept.
1056760	1060760	It's very clear that this game was very proud of its concept.
1060760	1064760	And it should be. It doesn't, like, we're all sitting here going, oh, it sounds like a cool game.
1064760	1066760	And that's what really sold me on buying the game.
1066760	1069760	And it's a good thing Nintendo Wii doesn't have demos or I probably would have figured that out a lot sooner.
1069760	1071760	Huh, got me.
1071760	1079760	But the game itself is this just bad Pac-Man rip-off where you, and I shouldn't say rip-off.
1079760	1085760	It's not a rip-off, but it's a Pac-Man-ish type of game where you move through a maze and you collect, you know,
1085760	1093760	I think they're supposed to be mini cubes or, you know, cube friends or something that are hidden throughout the maze and you avoid these monsters.
1093760	1104760	And then once you get past the Atari version of the game and the later versions of the game, you can press a button and it makes a little weapon so that it knocks out the monsters near you that you can use, like, five times throughout the course of the game.
1104760	1110760	Well, here's the thing. The game in the 4-bit version doesn't change by the time you get to the 128-bit version.
1110760	1116760	You're still playing the same damn game where you're moving throughout a maze trying to get the little cubes and avoid the monsters.
1116760	1121760	And it's just completely unimaginative when you get from the 4-bit to the Super Game.
1121760	1132760	I really think that they should do something where you're playing through different styles of games because the different genres evolve, you know, as...
1132760	1138760	Bingo. You hit the jackpot on that one because that's exactly what the problem with this game is.
1138760	1139760	Copyright Orange Zones Radio.
1139760	1147760	The genre didn't evolve at all in this game. I mean, and, you know, some might argue with me as I even tried, like, looking on the website, kind of seeing, like, who's in this game and stuff.
1147760	1151760	And the game definitely has its fans who are not responding well to the negative reviews out there on the internet saying,
1151760	1160760	Well, it's a game about competing for points and it's all this, you know, the game does evolve because in the Wii version you can flick the Wiimote to jump or something.
1160760	1169760	And no, I'm sorry. They're just dumb little frills to try and distinguish, you know, one genre to another. It doesn't work.
1169760	1183760	It didn't really innovate the game. It still is this really shoddy looking cube graphic moving around a shoddy looking cube maze that is the exact same type of maze that was in the 4-bit version just now presented in fancy 3D.
1183760	1194760	It's just not a good game. I'm sorry. If the 4-bit version had been the way it is, that's fine. But the problem is that as the game evolves, the game doesn't evolve.
1194760	1203760	And you can tell that they love the idea because they really show off, Oh, well, in the Super Nintendo version of this game you're going to have Mode 7 graphics.
1203760	1210760	I think you see Mode 7 graphics once and it's kind of like nothing of importance, like the zoom in and out.
1210760	1218760	The 32-bit version of the game has long load times, so you actually have to sit there between each level and wait for the game to load.
1218760	1226760	When you know damn well it's not loading anything. It's just a little, ha ha ha, isn't that funny? I remember loading times.
1226760	1228760	So it's novel, the game?
1228760	1237760	Basically, it's like, gee, weren't the 80s cool? Was that Goat Boy on Saturday Night Live? Weren't the 80s cool? It's like this.
1237760	1239760	No, we had bad hair and a flock of seagulls.
1239760	1242760	That's basically what it is.
1242760	1257760	So, unfortunately, Bit Boy, the game, not a fan. I'm sorry. And I know it was a little tiny studio that put the game together, but my advice, you guys, if some of them should actually hear the show or the fans hear the show, you've got to evolve the genre of the game with the game.
1257760	1268760	For me, the game didn't change between the 4-bit and the 128-bit. What really changed? The graphics? And now you can flick your Wiimote to jump or whatever. It's not enough.
1268760	1281760	And in the end, it's still about competing for a high score, which works for an Atari 2600-style game, but games weren't about just competing for high scores when you moved on into later generations. I think that's what they forgot.
1281760	1289760	You know, that speaks so true to life, because really, people never change. They just get older and then are able to flick their Wiimote.
1289760	1291760	Shut up.
1291760	1294760	So I don't recommend Bit Boy, sorry.
1294760	1310760	As far as other games I played this week on the Wii, a newer type of exercise game that came out from EA called EA Active. I got a gift card for my birthday I finally spent this week, and I decided I was going to take the plunge because I've gained quite a bit of weight.
1310760	1320760	Last year, I lost a lot of weight when I had my surgery. As I'm sure a lot of you guys know, I didn't have gastric bypass. I had gallbladder surgery, but with all the sickness I had last year...
1320760	1322760	If you had gastric bypass, you'd be losing weight.
1322760	1332760	Exactly. I lost a lot, a lot of weight in the last year. I went down from like 225 to like 185. I'm not even joking. I lost about 40 pounds, everything that happened last year.
1332760	1340760	I'm back up to about 200 and change, so I kind of want to exercise to get myself down to maintain a level of about 195.
1340760	1349760	And I thought, okay, I'm going to pick up this new game, this EA Active, because what I like about it from what I'm hearing on the box is that it has this customized training program, and that's what I need.
1349760	1354760	Because Wii Fit, what's Wii Fit? It's a clusterfuck of games and a way for you to measure your body fat once in a while.
1354760	1366760	But if I don't really know what I'm doing or what exercises I ought to be playing, that's one thing that Wii Fit really falls short in, is that it's just kind of all these exercises, and you kind of have to know what parts of the body you want to exercise.
1366760	1374760	But EA Active has a 30-day program. So I bought the game, decided to check it out, and okay, it's not bad.
1374760	1384760	It does support the Wii Balance Board, but it's not required to play. The game basically has two little add-ons that come with it that are extremely cheap, but you've got to consider the game costs $59.99.
1384760	1393760	One of the peripherals is basically a gigantic rubber band that you put these two straps on that's like a resistance band, which is actually...
1393760	1395760	Resistance bands are great.
1395760	1404760	Yeah, it's actually kind of a creative, cheap exercise tool. I've got to give them credit for that. It actually works for doing bicep curls and things of that nature.
1404760	1413760	The game also comes with a strap that you strap to your leg that you put the nunchuck in that would be ten times more awesome if it didn't keep falling off my leg while I'm exercising.
1413760	1418760	Because even as tight as I will make that thing, inevitably it slips off my leg and starts to fall.
1418760	1427760	It needed to have something where I can maybe clip it onto my shorts or something. It needed something else besides just the velcro around my hip. It needed something to secure it in place.
1427760	1437760	They do have a lot of third-party companies making peripherals. They even have one that has three different types of resistance bands, and they also have a different type of leg strap thing, so that might be the way to go.
1437760	1448760	I don't know, but it comes with this thing with the nunchuck, and it's kind of neat. It allows for all these different types of activities. And that's one thing I did notice about EA Active is that it is set up more like a, hey, this is an exercise program.
1448760	1453760	And we're going to show you all these videos that show you how to do the exercise, then you're going to do the exercise.
1453760	1461760	And I really felt like, granted, I don't have numbers to put side by side, but I did feel like EA Active has a higher variety of exercises in them.
1461760	1475760	As far as the fun factor, though, I don't think EA Active necessarily has the cutesy, fun look of Wii Fit, the really motivating type of cutesy, let's have a good time, Wii Party type of thing.
1475760	1482760	I didn't really see that in EA Active. It's a little more serious. And the graphics don't really even seem as good as Wii Fit.
1482760	1488760	But you have to consider, what is this game for? It's not there to be cute and amusing and entertaining. It's there to help you exercise.
1488760	1501760	And it does get that job done fairly well. My biggest bitch, some of the trying to watch your body do these motions, the game is not very good at picking up.
1501760	1509760	There's one in particular, the lunges you do on your feet, you basically lunge down, kind of like you crouch with one leg and bend your other leg at a 45 degree angle.
1509760	1517760	I am having the hardest time with the game picking this up. And I'm doing them the right way and everything, but there's no way to tell the game, okay, I'm doing it, just move on.
1517760	1522760	Like, if you are not doing the exercise correctly, you kind of have to twist and move your body until the game picks up.
1522760	1529760	And I was literally sitting there for like a minute, two minutes, trying to move around getting the game to detect me and it wouldn't do it.
1529760	1534760	So eventually I had to hit the button to skip the entire exercise. Well, I didn't get credit for doing the exercise.
1534760	1542760	So I wish there was a way you could just hit the two button or something and skip the step or something as opposed to skipping the entire exercise.
1542760	1550760	It really would go a long way. Otherwise, the detection was fairly good in most things. The only other place I'm going to be critical of the game is the soundtrack is really boring.
1550760	1558760	And it tries to say that, oh, it has all these genres, it has electronica and dancebeat and 80s, none of them are recognizable songs.
1558760	1562760	And when you consider a company like EA, usually license is pretty good music.
1562760	1563760	They have EA track?
1563760	1568760	Exactly. For a game like Burnout and so on, the fact that they couldn't do the same for a game like this is really disappointing.
1568760	1572760	And maybe they're waiting to see how a game like this is received so that they can do it in the sequel or something like that.
1572760	1576760	But I really just wanted to turn the damn thing off and put on my own music.
1576760	1577760	They're just having expansions.
1577760	1580760	Is that really the plan?
1580760	1581760	They've already announced them, yeah.
1581760	1587760	Oh, really? That could be interesting. I don't know. By the way, some of the activities use the balance board, which is okay.
1587760	1591760	Again, I don't think the balance board activities were nearly as fun as the ones on Wii Fit.
1591760	1601760	But again, what I like about the game, when I do the 30-day workout, which is about like a 30-minute workout every two days on, one day off for 30 days,
1601760	1604760	when you do this little 30-day workout, I really feel it the next day.
1604760	1609760	Like, it's a good workout, and I like the fact that it's like a rounded workout.
1609760	1616760	So if you're looking for a game that's going to put you on a workout plan, I think EA Active does a better job of that.
1616760	1619760	And it sounds like this could be the start of a much better franchise.
1619760	1630760	And it does seem exciting because when we get things like Project Natal to come out that will hopefully detect your body motion a lot better than the Wii Nunchuck and Wii Motor allowing,
1630760	1635760	I'm just excited for the possibilities that something like Project Natal can bring to exercise gaming.
1635760	1637760	That actually sounds like it'd be a lot of fun.
1637760	1642760	It's not a bad game by any means. There's just some little things I think can be done a little better.
1642760	1646760	But it sounds like, you know, if this is the start of a franchise, it's a decent start.
1646760	1651760	Or hello, support the goddamn SD memory card, put your own MP3s on there.
1651760	1657760	Right, right. And the other thing I should point out, you don't have to have the balance board to play this game.
1657760	1661760	I think it goes a long way in making some of the other activities a little more fun.
1661760	1664760	But technically, you don't have to have it.
1664760	1669760	So if you're willing to endure without the balance board, you can pick up this game for $59.99.
1669760	1671760	Not a bad deal.
1671760	1676760	And the EA's part, that's actually kind of smart because it puts out an exercise game that's cheaper than Wii Fit,
1676760	1680760	yet also enhances Wii Fit. I got to credit EA with that one.
1680760	1683760	So that was pretty much my gaming week, was those two games.
1683760	1688760	And I'm still feeling sore from just the two days of Wii workout I did earlier in the week.
1688760	1692760	I skipped yesterday. I have to do some when I go home tonight because I don't want to miss a day.
1692760	1696760	Because I have to be thin and beautiful before the Reno show in August.
1696760	1700760	All right. Anyhow, let's see.
1700760	1701760	I just got an idea, by the way.
1701760	1702760	What's that?
1702760	1705760	Well, I was showing off screen caps of the house that I made in The Sims.
1705760	1706760	Uh-huh.
1706760	1708760	I'm thinking about doing OLR exclusives.
1708760	1709760	Go for it.
1709760	1710760	Yeah, why not?
1710760	1711760	Why not?
1711760	1717760	So I will do, as soon as I can actually get to a point where I can save that property, I will do exclusive Sims.
1717760	1719760	I should make ones of you guys.
1719760	1720760	Go for it.
1720760	1721760	I've got one of me.
1721760	1723760	I'll be fine. I'd be fine with that.
1723760	1725760	I read you some comments from chat, chat.orensonsrated.com.
1725760	1731760	Xenocore says, Rob, screw this EA crap. Get you some P90X Interactive Online Extreme.
1731760	1733760	Work out until your insides come out.
1733760	1735760	I'm not aware of this game.
1735760	1737760	Maybe it's something I need to do more research on.
1737760	1739760	I'd be okay with looking that up.
1739760	1741760	Sounds interesting.
1741760	1747760	I like the idea of an online game where I can kind of get motivated with friends and in a community.
1747760	1751760	I think that's one big thing that the Wii workout programs are missing.
1751760	1758760	And I think, you know what, I really hope that when Project Natal comes out, a big, big exercise game is not far behind.
1758760	1764760	Because I think one place where Xbox Live is going to really blow these Wii games out of the water is the online component.
1764760	1766760	It's going to be very interesting to see what that brings to the table.
1766760	1768760	But I'm curious about the other game. I'll check it out, I guess.
1768760	1770760	I don't think it's necessarily a game.
1770760	1775760	It's just, it's an extreme home fitness training system, they call it.
1775760	1777760	Oh, God.
1777760	1778760	Sucker.
1778760	1780760	I'm a sucker.
1780760	1782760	What is it? Some type of...
1782760	1784760	It's just like working out, like hard.
1784760	1787760	Interesting. I'll check it out. I'll Google it.
1787760	1791760	Alright, anyhow, let's move on though with some housekeeping tonight quickly.
1791760	1793760	Xenocore says, please tell me he knows that's a joke.
1793760	1796760	No, I didn't know it's a joke. I've never heard of it before.
1796760	1798760	Thank you, Loki, for doing the research.
1798760	1804760	Alright, let's see, going on to some stuff within the community.

1812760	1815760	Just search for O-L-R-M-Y, O-L-R-M-Y.
1815760	1821760	Rob, I was also going to say, I believe they did a blog for EA Sports Active,
1821760	1826760	The 30 Day Challenge, and I think, I don't know if they're starting it again.
1826760	1830760	It's, I guess there's someone else that's taking the 30 Day Challenge.
1830760	1835760	Peter Moore basically said that you'll lose weight after 30 days or something like that,
1835760	1840760	but I was trying to find, they had one person that actually completed it,
1840760	1843760	and I wanted to see what the results were.
1843760	1847760	Unfortunately, I cannot, oh, here we go.
1847760	1853760	You know what's funny? I am using the Wii Fit channel to weigh myself in every day.
1853760	1859760	Jayrod in chat said, Richard Simmons presents, Sweeten to the 80s.
1859760	1862760	You know what? I would actually buy a game like that.
1862760	1866760	Say what you want about how odd Richard Simmons is, but you know what?
1866760	1870760	He's a highly motivating guy, and what bad thing has he ever done,
1870760	1874760	besides being a little bit weird, right?
1874760	1877760	Also, my mother loves him, so no joke.
1877760	1878760	I think he's fantastic.
1878760	1879760	I think he is too.
1879760	1882760	This person actually did it for 30 days.
1882760	1892760	They started off that their weight was 235, and some other habits he also brought on.
1892760	1899760	He drank half his body weight in fluid ounces of water, which you're supposed to,
1899760	1902760	so 120 ounces of water a day.
1902760	1907760	This is roughly 500 calories before resting.
1907760	1916760	150 grams of protein, 4 to 6 small meals, avoided carbs, and plenty of fiber.
1916760	1923760	Besides all that, and did the exercises, they lost 12.5 pounds in 30 days.
1923760	1927760	Hmm. Not bad. Not bad.
1927760	1930760	You notice, though, it's about changing other lifestyles, too,
1930760	1933760	which the game will tell you. It will kind of walk you through that,
1933760	1935760	but it's not like the game can tell what you ate yesterday.
1935760	1942760	Yeah, I mean, drinking water is good, eating lots of meals, smaller meals instead of big meals,
1942760	1947760	something I really needed to do, but I started myself until lunch.
1947760	1948760	That's not healthy.
1948760	1949760	I know it's not.
1949760	1955760	And then I go get the third pounder burger, which is really not healthy, but I don't care.
1955760	1957760	All right, let's get into some actual gaming.
1957760	1958760	If I may say one thing, though.
1958760	1959760	Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
1959760	1965760	The first and foremost thing is starting to create the healthy self-image before you do any of this.
1965760	1967760	If you're going to do it, do it for the right reasons.
1967760	1972760	Don't do it because, oh, I want to be skinny and pretty. Skinny is not pretty.
1972760	1974760	But I do want to be skinny and pretty.
1974760	1975760	You know what I mean.
1975760	1977760	Sorry, Rob, you can only pick one.
1977760	1979760	I just want to be back where I was before. That's my goal.
1979760	1983760	See, that's what, you remember when I had pneumonia and lost all that weight?
1983760	1990760	I'm actually trying to get back to that size because I had more energy when I was that size.
1990760	1991760	Or you could do a tapeworm diet.
1991760	1992760	Shut up.
1992760	1993760	I wouldn't mind a tapeworm.
1993760	1995760	Oh, you guys are disgusting.
1995760	2002760	But yeah, one thing that's important about these types of games, you're not going to get thin just buying the game and looking at the box.
2002760	2006760	At the same time, you're not going to get thin buying the game and playing it for five minutes a day.
2006760	2014760	At the same time, you're not going to get thin by buying the game, playing it for 30 minutes one day out of an entire week.
2014760	2017760	You have to make a commitment to exercise five times a week.
2017760	2020760	And I'm taking that walking class.
2020760	2026760	They say you need to get your heart rate up for 20 minutes a day or at least three times a week.
2026760	2036760	Get your heart rate up to at least 65% of your max heart rate and then hold it there for at least 20 minutes.
2036760	2037760	Alright.
2037760	2038760	And that's the way to do it.
2038760	2042760	Alright, so think carefully before you jump into one of these Wii exercise programs.
2042760	2048760	I think they can work because I think anything is better than your big butt sitting on the couch playing a game for 30 minutes.
2048760	2051760	I mean, if you're up and moving, that's certainly better than that.
2051760	2053760	So anyway, let's move on.
2053760	2055760	Let's get into some gaming stories tonight.
2055760	2058760	And Loki's going to start us off with some gaming discussion.
2058760	2062760	Yes. Dragon Quest IX came out just last week.
2062760	2065760	And of course, it's already sold millions of copies.
2065760	2070760	In fact, it sold 2.3 million copies in two days, which is pretty awesome.
2070760	2076760	Totally blowing away any other game that was coming out that week or actually even out at the time.
2076760	2080760	Just completely knocked everything out of the water as far as sales goes.
2080760	2083760	But of course, Dragon Quest is a huge series in Japan.
2083760	2087760	Not so much over here, but hey, we're working on it.
2087760	2090760	That's pretty cool.
2090760	2095760	And it's not a big surprise that it did well.
2095760	2100760	But hopefully it will do well when it comes over here.
2100760	2102760	It probably won't.
2102760	2104760	Well, it's not going to do that good.
2104760	2111760	I think definitely Dragon Quest has its fans that will justify Square translating the game and bringing it out over here.
2111760	2116760	Although I think they do lose a little bit in sales from not doing it a little faster.
2116760	2121760	Because I think you do get people that import the game and or steal the game while it's out in Japan.
2121760	2124760	So I think they need to get their turnaround times down a bit.
2124760	2127760	But I think the game will still sell decent enough.
2127760	2134760	But let's just face it, it's not Halo or Madden or the things we go crazy about in this country.
2134760	2135760	True.
2135760	2137760	Although Dragon Quest IX certainly has its fans.
2137760	2139760	Although people do go crazy for Final Fantasy.
2139760	2142760	I think Final Fantasy has a bit more name recognition.
2142760	2149760	And also keep in mind that Dragon Quest had a different name when we first got them over here, remember?
2149760	2154760	True, and they didn't really come back until 8 came out over here on the Playstation 2.
2154760	2156760	7 was out here, right?
2156760	2159760	No, they did. Keep in mind, 2 and 3 were out on the Nintendo.
2159760	2163760	It's the Super Nintendo generation they completely skipped, which I think hurt them in the long run.
2163760	2165760	Because we all got Final Fantasy 2 and 3.
2165760	2171760	I understand that, but they didn't really come back big time until 8.
2171760	2173760	True, true. I understand.
2173760	2175760	That was a big marketing push, too.
2175760	2180760	I think even though we had Dragon Quest VII was out on the Playstation 1, I don't remember ever hearing about it.
2180760	2183760	It was really Dragon Quest VIII where they really started pushing it.
2183760	2186760	But that was also the first game under the Square Enix banner, if I remember right.
2186760	2191760	Maybe Enix just didn't have the marketing push here in America that it did over in Japan.
2191760	2193760	I think that's a big part of it.
2193760	2197760	Now, I hear this game has been getting a lot of negative feedback on Amazon.com,
2197760	2200760	although I guess that ultimately doesn't matter now, does it?
2200760	2203760	It's the sales that drive it, not the ratings.
2203760	2207760	Although, it would be interesting to see what happens next week.
2207760	2211760	You know, if the sales numbers take a big dive or what happens.
2211760	2215760	Orlan in chat says, Final Fantasy is dead.
2215760	2219760	Really? I don't know. I think Final Fantasy XIII is going to do well.
2219760	2221760	I don't think that it's dead.
2221760	2223760	I think that it'll lull.
2223760	2228760	I don't think it's as popular as it was in the Playstation 1 era,
2228760	2230760	but I think the games will still sell like crazy.
2230760	2236760	I think XIII is going to be the biggest selling RPG on both platforms, both Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.
2236760	2239760	But it's still not going to sell Halo-sized numbers, that's for sure.
2239760	2242760	But it'll be a big game.
2242760	2246760	Maybe combined it will. I don't know.
2246760	2251760	See, and then Orlan goes on to say, X marked the end of good Final Fantasy games.
2251760	2253760	But see, there's tons of people that would debate that.
2253760	2255760	Because some would even say X wasn't a good Final Fantasy game.
2255760	2257760	A lot of people love XII.
2257760	2259760	Yeah, I thought XII was fine.
2259760	2262760	It's just XII came out at a really bad time.
2262760	2265760	And XII really should have just been made for the next-gen systems.
2265760	2267760	I think that was the biggest problem with Final Fantasy XII.
2267760	2269760	It really missed out.
2269760	2273760	Final Fantasy XI, you know, that's a whole other thing.
2273760	2276760	Maybe Final Fantasy XI should have just been Final Fantasy Online.
2276760	2280760	I think the whole fact that they did an online game with a number really turned some people off.
2280760	2283760	But guess what? It's going to happen again with Final Fantasy XIV.
2283760	2286760	I don't care, because I'm buying Final Fantasy XIV.
2286760	2288760	XI was fun for a while.
2288760	2293760	Granted, it had its rough spots in the beginning, but now a lot of that's just been patched out.
2293760	2298760	But I still enjoyed it, even with all the frustrations of it.
2298760	2303760	And I would still be playing it today if I had the time to play it, but I don't.
2303760	2305760	So I'm not.
2305760	2308760	But it was awesome. I mean, I wouldn't be going the while.
2308760	2309760	Fuck that shit.
2309760	2312760	ActDeft reminds us in chat, Famitsu gave it a perfect score.
2312760	2316760	That's right, Dragon Quest IX got a perfect score in Famitsu, which is the first-
2316760	2318760	Damn near impossible, too.
2318760	2321760	It's the first Dragon Quest game to do so, actually.
2321760	2323760	Which is kind of surprising.
2323760	2326760	So it's funny, because you have that, and then you have the Amazon.com reviews
2326760	2328760	where a lot of the users are slamming the game.
2328760	2331760	But I don't know, is that just angry internet wank?
2331760	2334760	Yeah, the internet is angry.
2334760	2338760	I don't know how to tell until I actually buy the game myself, but we'll see.
2338760	2340760	By the way, I guess more and more games.
2340760	2344760	Remember when that was a hella hard thing to get, was a perfect 40 in Famitsu magazine?
2344760	2347760	There was only like four games that had it for the longest time.
2347760	2350760	Now there's like 10 or 11 that have gotten a perfect 10.
2350760	2354760	Yeah, they're starting to move to the IGN scoring method there.
2354760	2358760	Apparently Nintendogs was one of the games that got a perfect 40 in the history.
2358760	2361760	Yeah, it was a perfect 40 for the first 40 minutes.
2361760	2364760	And then after that, it's just like, wait, why am I building this?
2364760	2371760	Exactly. Also, Final Fantasy XII was the first Final Fantasy game to get a perfect 40 for Famitsu magazine.
2371760	2377760	So some would argue that XII was not a good Final Fantasy game.
2377760	2380760	Yeah, Xenocore says, Rob, some said Famitsu has lost its bite.
2380760	2383760	They have given out four perfects in the last year. This is true.
2383760	2390760	You look at how much difference there is between now and the past, and it's definitely different.
2390760	2394760	Anyhow, that's all we've got on Dragon Quest IX for now.
2394760	2396760	I think we'll come back to it a little later in the show.
2396760	2399760	I want to talk about The Conduit, which is a game that came out here in the US.
2399760	2404760	It was supposed to be a really big title over here, but I don't think the game's been selling very well, has it?
2404760	2405760	Nope.
2405760	2409760	No, that's sad. What's wrong with The Conduit? Why is it not selling well?
2409760	2416760	It's because it's more of a mature type of game, and unfortunately there's not a lot of those people on the Wii.
2416760	2421760	Interesting. So now maybe Nintendo's marketing is coming back to bite them a little bit.
2421760	2425760	Although, in the scope of things, does it really matter? They don't care.
2425760	2430760	No, it really comes down to Nintendo being retarded, and it's retarded in their own benefit, and here's why.
2430760	2435760	Because with the GameCube, they were frustrated that the system was viewed as a system for kids,
2435760	2441760	and that they couldn't get any good third-party franchises that were more mature to work out for them.
2441760	2446760	They thought, okay, the Wii is going to be different. It's going to be this all-around system that everyone's going to love.
2446760	2450760	Except they had Resident Evil 4, which was one of the best third-party games to come out last generation.
2450760	2453760	Well, there's exceptions to all the rules, but that's not the point.
2453760	2458760	The point is, then the Wii comes out instead of, hey, we're going to take what we learned from the GameCube,
2458760	2462760	and we're going to make this better, and we're going to market it to everybody.
2462760	2468760	No, we're just going to market it to the kids now, and casual gamers, and grandmas, and go with that.
2468760	2475760	And really, if you ask me, I don't think they give a crap about the third-party, mature-rated games.
2475760	2485760	I think it's a good genre they have on that system, because there's people like me that don't want to go play Mario Tennis,
2485760	2491760	or Mario Soccer, or Mario Badminton, or whatever the hell they're going to come out with next.
2491760	2498760	So, Conduit, if I had time, once again, it's another game that I have that I just haven't gotten to play yet.
2498760	2503760	If I had the chance to play it, then yeah, I'd probably enjoy it, because I enjoyed MadWorld a lot.
2503760	2510760	And this was one of those games that was high-voltage studios, it was really impressive, the tech demo and everything.
2510760	2519760	But I think overall, it's a good game, but it wasn't like, oh my god, this is better than Metroid, better than everything.
2519760	2524760	I mean, they've done a lot of things right with it, but at the same time, it's a very generic shooter.
2524760	2529760	A lot of the same cliches that you would see in Halo and pretty much every other sci-fi shooter out there.
2529760	2534760	Had really good online, but that's kind of being ruined now.
2534760	2538760	But it's just, I don't know, even MadWorld didn't do that well.
2538760	2540760	Alright, well, looking at some comments from chat, J-Rod says,
2540760	2546760	Conduit is a very mediocre title. It's only hyped because it's on the Wii, the barren wasteland of third-party games.
2546760	2551760	And then Fear the Claw says, it's a passable shooter, but not the amazing game it should have been, but not really a bad game.
2551760	2556760	J-Rod also continues on to say, people also slammed Conduit because it wasn't Metroid Prime on the Wii.
2556760	2559760	Anyway, that's actually not the story I wanted to talk about.
2559760	2565760	What I wanted to talk about is that there's a hacker out there named HitoAn2 that apparently has hacked the shit out of this game.
2565760	2574760	Apparently you can hack this game very easily to get infinite ammo, health, invisibility, off the radar, and just all these hacks.
2574760	2576760	By the way, you can also hack it online.
2576760	2579760	The hacker said, everything is virtually unprotected.
2579760	2587760	All values can be edited fairly easy, and there's virtually no sign of an attempt at hiding values, fixing bugs, or preventing online hackers.
2587760	2591760	The hacker goes on to say that hacking online is cake.
2591760	2597760	Quote, the only difference is in the online mode, the game sends the variables in real time to the server.
2597760	2600760	And apparently some patch codes actually came out for the game.
2600760	2608760	And I guess initially he altered them to actually make the save files corrupt for anybody that used them.
2608760	2617760	And I guess he's working with the people that created the game to see who used them, and then they're gonna ban them.
2617760	2622760	Whoever installed this cheat, they're actually gonna ban, which is kind of an interesting end to the story.
2622760	2625760	Yeah, it's an interesting end to the story, seeing as they can't do that.
2625760	2627760	It's impossible to ban people.
2627760	2633760	In fact, it's hilarious that they even mention that, because they try the same thing with Mario Kart, banning people.
2633760	2640760	And you know what? You can use the same cheat devices that they're using to hex edit stuff to override the ban.
2640760	2642760	So it doesn't really do anything at all.
2642760	2647760	And basically, it sounds like they're using the Rockstar method of game programming,
2647760	2658760	where they leave everything in very well-documented text files on the disc itself, and everything is labeled very properly with infinite ammo.
2658760	2662760	Check one, toggle this on. It's just ridiculous.
2662760	2666760	And thank you, Rockstar, for doing that, because it's awesome to mod your games.
2666760	2670760	Well, look, but if you were playing a modded game online, you're kind of a butt anyway.
2670760	2673760	I mean, it's one thing to do it in private circles. I know that's what you do, Loki.
2673760	2680760	But if you actually go on Xbox Live and play these modded for infinite health and all this stuff, you're kind of a butt to begin with.
2680760	2681760	Well, yeah.
2681760	2685760	But if you want to hack your personal one-player game, have a ball.
2685760	2691760	Or private circle games where everybody has infinite health and everybody has access to the same hacks, then fine.
2691760	2694760	That's up to you and your hard-earned money.
2694760	2702760	But going on Xbox Live or going on Nintendo Wi-Fi connection with these hacked games, you're kind of a douche, let's face it.
2702760	2707760	Well, yeah. And there's a lot of people. Unfortunately, Mario Kart's been kind of ruined by it.
2707760	2711760	And I'm not sure about Call of Duty or anything like that.
2711760	2716760	But there's a lot of the popular Smash Brothers. There's a lot of people hacking that kind of stuff.
2716760	2721760	I don't know. It's just something that they have to work out.
2721760	2727760	And fortunately, we're kind of at a disadvantage because once again, Nintendo decided, you know what?
2727760	2731760	We don't need to patch our games. We're just not going to put a patching system in there at all, period.
2731760	2738760	So if your game is broken or you find out there's a glitch or something they should have fixed in the 11th hour, too bad.
2738760	2740760	You're fucked.
2740760	2745760	Couldn't they do something on the server side, though, that says if this does not equal this, then boot user?
2745760	2747760	That's all they're going to be able to do as far as patching the game goes.
2747760	2754760	They can only do it on the server end and maybe banning the IPs of those people or something like that.
2754760	2758760	That would be the way to go if they could do that or ban the MAC.
2758760	2761760	That's actually what it's been doing is banning the MAC address.
2761760	2768760	But once again, all people are doing is hex editing the memory to alter their MAC address and boom, they're online again.
2768760	2774760	So, oh well. It's bound to happen with every game.
2774760	2778760	Alright, well, there you go. The game's being out there and being hacked.
2778760	2781760	So if you want to hack this game, have fun.
2781760	2784760	But the only thing I would say with that, don't go online.
2784760	2786760	If you're going to hack, don't go online with it.
2786760	2790760	Yeah, I'd totally play that game with infinite ammo and stuff like that because that's just fun.
2790760	2795760	Just like doing that with Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.
2795760	2798760	I played that game with infinite health and infinite rockets.
2798760	2800760	That was a blast.
2800760	2802760	Nice.
2802760	2809760	Well, that's all I have to say about the Conduit and the latest hack, so let's move on to Dark Sacras for some more gaming news.
2809760	2817760	Well, it's just a little something that I think is actually cool for our UK listeners is they put out a date for Scribblenauts in the UK.
2817760	2820760	It's supposed to be coming out on the 25th of September.
2820760	2832760	And basically, as we've talked about, you summon anything, practically, and then, you know, use it, whatever.
2832760	2836760	Like all the lolcats in the universe.
2836760	2843760	We've heard to death about Scribblenauts this game, and I have a bad feeling this is going to turn out like Nintendogs.
2843760	2849760	Call me crazy, I have a bad feeling this game is going to go the way of Nintendogs where it's got all this hype pre-release,
2849760	2852760	and then when it comes out, people are going to be like, okay.
2852760	2855760	We'll be all into it, into it, into it, and then a month later, eh.
2855760	2858760	Yeah, we read all the funny stuff online already.
2858760	2862760	Well, I don't know. I just thought it was noteworthy that they put out the UK date.
2862760	2869760	No, it's definitely noteworthy that it's coming to the UK as well, especially when those guys usually get screwed out of releases for a long, long time after we do.
2869760	2873760	But, you know, again, it doesn't change my opinion on the game.
2873760	2883760	We need that kind of technology with LittleBigPlanet where we can spawn, you know, babies attached to meat and blurred lines.
2883760	2885760	I don't know.
2885760	2887760	Did you have the suicide babies? Did you try to see if that was there?
2887760	2889760	I haven't given up hope on this game yet.
2889760	2896760	Maybe there'll be something on Xbox Live or something. It'd be kind of cool where you could do that in a big sandbox on Xbox Live, but I don't know.
2896760	2897760	That would be neat.
2897760	2900760	There's only so much Scribblenauts talk I can take.
2900760	2906760	But also with that, they'd really not be able to, they'd have to super monitor the online content.
2906760	2915760	You know, with a really powerful switch, you know, really powerful machine made out of switches in LittleBigPlanet,
2915760	2922760	you could come up with something very similar to Scribblenauts where you would drop letters in these little boxes or something like that to spell words out
2922760	2926760	and you could have it spawn an object or something like that and be able to interact with it.
2926760	2930760	It could be done. It'd just be a lot of work.
2930760	2932760	Work? Who wants to do that?
2932760	2934760	Exactly. No one wants to do work.
2934760	2942760	We have someone in chat asking, they didn't change their nickname so I don't know what their name is, but does anyone know what the game is going to be about?
2942760	2943760	Like, is there a story or what?
2943760	2951760	Yeah, the story is basically that you are collecting these star pieces and I'm not really sure why.
2951760	2954760	Maybe they put the stars back in the sky or something like that, you know, cheesy.
2954760	2962760	And then basically you just go through different levels and try to solve the puzzles given, you know, whatever.
2962760	2965760	With an entire dictionary of weapons available to you.
2965760	2975760	But they're also, you know, they have pars on each of the levels that you're trying to get, you know, the level finished with so many objects spawn or something like that.
2975760	2978760	So it could be interesting and then the level editor would be nice.
2978760	2981760	So Meat Baby will probably not solve every level.
2981760	2985760	I'm going to try though. Definitely going to try that.
2985760	2997760	A totally different subject. Microsoft is planning on bringing a music streaming service to, I don't know, I guess they're going to create their own music service.
2997760	3001760	Not necessarily Last.fm, I mean, because they do have that coming to the Xbox.
3001760	3009760	But this might be something different that they're going to create, you know, very similar like Pandora or something like that.
3009760	3016760	That's actually going to be available as well. Maybe a competitor to Last.fm and Pandora.
3016760	3019760	But basically this is coming from the Telegraph.
3019760	3032760	And Peter Bale, the executive producer of MSN is saying that they're going to launch a music service imminently by the end of July.
3032760	3043760	And I guess it will perform similar to Spotify, a streaming music service which offers both an ad supported listening option as well as a premium subscription with no ads.
3043760	3051760	And, you know, not sure if they're going to integrate it with the Xbox, but I don't see why not.
3051760	3059760	It's kind of interesting though that they would do this and then still have Last.fm integration with, you know, the Xbox and not their own service.
3059760	3065760	Which is very strange unless Microsoft were going to buy Last.fm or something. But it's strange.
3065760	3071760	Yeah, and they also have the Zune music library that they could be integrating with that as well.
3071760	3075760	So maybe they're just going to have all these different services all tied together or something like that.
3075760	3089760	And this is Chia100Matt in chat says knowing them they're going to buy Live3CC5 which is funny because that's kind of what this service sounds like. You can listen to the music with ads or all of the ads will be for their ad-free stream.
3089760	3092760	That's what Live3CC5 was. Remember that?
3092760	3095760	I'm so glad. We don't have to put up with that anymore.
3095760	3098760	Yeah, it's kind of nice. I've got to say all things considered.
3098760	3107760	As much as I miss having our own station that we have control of, things have worked out over here. Definitely we have Bobby as a lead in which has been very cool and all that.
3107760	3117760	So yeah, I mean the move was a good thing. But Live3CC5, this sounds kind of like that. So it'll be interesting to see if all the ads are for the ad-free service.
3117760	3129760	Very strange that they would have this when Last.fm is coming out as well unless Last.fm is not going to work the way we want to. Or the other thing to consider is that maybe it's not coming to the Xbox.
3129760	3137760	All this story is that Microsoft is coming up with a service and maybe that's for use on PCs or Windows 7 or with the Zune.
3137760	3145760	But that doesn't necessarily mean it's 100% coming to Xbox 360. I think everybody's making that assumption. But it would sure make sense of course.
3145760	3147760	Yeah.
3147760	3153760	So, I don't know. I guess we will see. Robocoon in chat says, I've checked up on Live3CC5. Damn, it's gone downhill.
3153760	3162760	Actually, I did too because I heard some of those rates and the fees that kind of pushed us out of there in the first place and they decided to skyrocket.
3162760	3169760	I understand why they were doing that. They were doing that in response to the government increase. I heard some of that got resolved this past week.
3169760	3173760	So I went to Live3CC5 to see if their rates dropped for broadcasting. No.
3173760	3183760	Hearing that there was also something similar happening to Terrestrial Radio as well, because I've been hearing ads when I listen to the radio, which is hardly ever.
3183760	3192760	But I've been hearing ads saying, oh, they're going to start charging. They're going to take away the music that you listen to because they're going to start raising their licensing fees.
3192760	3195760	I'm like, boo fucking who? Seriously.
3195760	3204760	Well, I get it though. I don't understand why record labels keep trying to raise the prices of what it's going to cost for these broadcasters to do it.
3204760	3209760	I mean, they are putting internet radio out of business, which is too bad because they're biting the hand that feeds them.
3209760	3218760	How do people find new songs, the radio and stuff? If radio gets stupid or is just all ad-ridden, people are just going to go listen to the same old shit on their iPods.
3218760	3227760	That's why most people have left radio. I think they're doing a dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb thing by demanding these higher rates. Stupid, stupid, stupid.
3227760	3229760	They're greedy. I stopped listening to the radio a long time ago.
3229760	3237760	I rarely listen to it. I wish I had XM Sirius in my car. My next car, I want to get that. We'll see.
3237760	3249760	Anyhow, speaking of making your own music, Rock Band is going to be getting a new rock band network. This is pretty interesting because this is coming exclusively to the Xbox 360, at least for now.
3249760	3256760	It's kind of like, I guess you could say, to make a long story short, it's kind of like XNA, but for rock band songs.
3256760	3259760	This is all from a report from Billboard Magazine.
3259760	3273760	Apparently anyone, if you're in an independent band or if you're on a major label, if you want to get your song into rock band, you'll be able to essentially take your master versions with this software that's coming out, create your own music files, and then be able to put them in rock band.
3273760	3284760	After they go through a service that makes sure that the songs are actually playable and have a reasonable difficulty, in other words, not too easy and not too difficult, and aren't stolen.
3284760	3291760	So they'll all have to go through this kind of peer review service, but you'll be able to charge between 50 cents and $3 and you'll get 30% of whatever the track sales are.
3291760	3301760	By the way, it's not going to go in the same rock band storefront that exists now. It's like a separate rock band store, but the songs will still load and be playable in rock band.
3301760	3307760	So very interesting sort of development here, where now anyone can get a song into rock band, essentially.
3307760	3319760	And then Harmonic says to Activision, and that's how you do it. Seriously, this is way better than the Guitar Hero store, where you can do the custom tracks and that kind of stuff.
3319760	3327760	Their whole track editor. I mean, this is above and beyond that. Just so much. It's ridiculous.
3327760	3340760	Granted, it's not free like the Guitar Hero store or whatever, but I think it's willing to be better. And you're going to see a lot of content on there now. Just loads of it.
3340760	3342760	It's going to be all these bands that you've probably never heard of.
3342760	3346760	I know. I think you're going to see a lot of crap, but there's some people that are really into indie bands.
3346760	3354760	And I think where this is going to come in really handy is, let's say you have this indie band who's trying to sell CDs that's doing these concerts in local areas.
3354760	3362760	Now they can say, hey, check out our song on rock band, and we're going to have flyers at the door that tell you how to get on the store and download our song on rock band.
3362760	3371760	I think it's just an extra avenue for the struggling artists to make money, which even though 30% of 50 cents is very low, something's better than nothing. That's what they always say.
3371760	3378760	But I can't imagine this is going to be easy to do, because you're going to have to essentially make your own note charts, is what it sounds like.
3378760	3389760	The software looks pretty easy to use. You're basically just setting up, you know, you kind of map it out via MIDI and stuff, and you decide where you want your frets to go and that kind of stuff.
3389760	3394760	And you can do it with the audio and for singing and that kind of stuff as well.
3394760	3401760	Granted, it's going to take a little bit of work, but when you think about it, it doesn't cost them anything to upload their tracks.
3401760	3414760	So yeah, they're only making 30% off of it, but you know what? 30% for no cost is excellent. I mean, there's no publishing fees or anything.
3414760	3419760	And Deathwishing in chat is yelling, fucking punk, I want to see a lot of indie punk.
3419760	3430760	And you know what, actually, and this kind of ties into something Bobby was talking about on his show tonight, the Bobby Black Wolf show, which is always on before us on All Games Radio at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on allgames.com on Sunday nights, right before we tape.
3430760	3440760	He was talking about this story, I know, and was actually kind of asking us when we did the little tossover we do at the end of his show, kind of asking us about how we felt about country music coming to rock band.
3440760	3446760	I know he was talking about all these other different genres. Well, this is going to blow the door wide open on all of that.
3446760	3457760	Nowhere in here does it say you must put a rock song on the service. Somebody could upload a music file of a kit and drumming, and as long as it's of a reasonable difficulty, you could put it on the service.
3457760	3463760	That would be awesome. I would like to see some drum and bass songs in there, like something like Pendulum or something.
3463760	3472760	Is there anywhere in the rules say it has to be a particular type of song? I mean, I think it does say that you can't have, you know, fuck, shit, cock, piss, you know, as your lyrics.
3472760	3486760	You know, you have to still have a family clean version of the song, but there's nothing to prevent you from doing, you know, the kit and band with their hit single Meow Meow Meow, you know, there's nothing to stop you from doing these type of experimental stuff.
3486760	3501760	That's awesome. And in fact, I think they need that. And now everybody in the chat room is yelling out, early green day, tons of ska, and so on and so on, you know, and sure, everybody's going to be clamoring for this certain type of thing.
3501760	3514760	But what this, this opens that up to possibly be a reality, which is kind of cool. You know, what also is cool is that now since Xbox Live has done a good job getting their marketplace online, and you can link directly to things in the store,
3514760	3521760	how easy is it going to be for an artist to put on their website, click here to go to the Microsoft store and put our song in your queue.
3521760	3525760	And if you're charging only 50 cents for your song, which would be how many Microsoft points is that?
3525760	3526760	40.
3526760	3533760	40 Microsoft points. Okay, so, you know, how many of us don't already have 40 points just kind of left over waiting to be spent?
3533760	3540760	If you've ever used the Microsoft store before, you know, on Xbox Live, you usually have leftover points. It's part of the annoyance of having to buy clusters of points at a time.
3540760	3546760	People are going to easily drop the 40 points, just click a button on the computer, and then it'll download next time you power on your Xbox.
3546760	3559760	I do this all the time, by the way, for demos and things. I'll go on to the Xbox Live store, queue up the things I want to download, and then when I turn on my Xbox, they just come in like magic, which is cool.
3559760	3562760	And some comments in chat.
3562760	3571760	ActDef says, meaning I don't have to pay 99 US dollars for the service unless I want to upload songs. Not just anybody can upload songs.
3571760	3575760	You have to be the copyright owner in order to basically upload the songs.
3575760	3581760	And the other part I should have mentioned, you do have to be a member of the XNA development community in order to do this.
3581760	3591760	But they are really selling this. Like, they're going to have its own little specialized little corner of the marketplace and all this stuff where, you know, a rock band developer's community.
3591760	3603760	Which I do think it's going to be pretty big. I think it's going to be tough to find the gems you want amongst all the garbage that's about to hit on this.
3603760	3615760	But if artists are smart about linking to the Xbox Live marketplace and making it very easy for you to drop money on their music, I think this has the potential to do very well, especially for a little tiny artist.
3615760	3625760	And, you know, not necessarily us, because we don't have time to put it into it, but I know there's many websites out there that rate and review all the community games that come out.
3625760	3628760	And I'm sure they're going to do the same thing when all these independent-
3628760	3632760	Well, you'll still be able to get the 30-second samples just like you can in a regular rock band, too.
3632760	3633760	Yeah.
3633760	3637760	So you can actually listen to the song. And I'm sure most artist websites will have it.
3637760	3646760	That would be awesome to make, like, a 30-second portion of your song really kick ass and then the rest is just banging pots and pans and that's it.
3646760	3656760	I think that you, myself, and Dark Soccer should all get a song on Xbox Live Marketplace that is us banging pots and pans together and yelling incoherent lyrics.
3656760	3657760	Oh, wait, we need a ukulele.
3657760	3664760	Yes, and a ukulele. We'll get Marissa up here to play some folk music that we'll add our pots and pans banging to. It'll be fun.
3664760	3669760	Maybe we can look up Mo. I know she hasn't been on the show in a long, long time, but I don't know if you remember Mo, but she came on and sang Still Alive.
3669760	3670760	Maybe we can get her to sing or something.
3670760	3672760	Or we can get the Dalek to sing.
3672760	3674760	Well, no, because that would be copyright.
3674760	3679760	But we can get Shermy to meow. Tell me this would be epic.
3679760	3682760	That would be a disaster.
3682760	3687760	Deathwishing says, this is just what the music industry needed, Rob. I agree.
3687760	3689760	How about something a little less disastrous, Rob?
3689760	3690760	Alright, how about it?
3690760	3696760	Well, you know, Sony's been all, ooh, PSI, it's so cool, it's so cool.
3696760	3719760	Well, actually, SCEE's head of developer services, Kishi Hirani, was saying that it can actually recognize face and individual feature, that it can, sorry, that it will be able to detect gender, age of face, different facial features, and tell what your expression is.
3719760	3728760	And they actually did a whole presentation on it, saying that it actually tracks facial movement.
3728760	3731760	It's supposed to be part of the motion controller demo.
3731760	3744760	So I actually think that that's kind of neat, because then, like, if they do a game that you can map your features onto your character or something, you can actually map your animations as well.
3744760	3747760	It'd be almost realistic expression.
3747760	3754760	Well, I hope they actually do something with this instead of just releasing the demo and just going, oh, well, that was cool.
3754760	3763760	And that's it, because they had those really cool tech demos where, you know, it was like a lunar lander type of game where you actually draw your landscape and then you go play it and stuff.
3763760	3766760	And they showed that wonderful tech demo that was, like, combat.
3766760	3771760	And did those ever come out? No, because they were tech demos, and that was it.
3771760	3778760	So, awesome, you know, it can detect, you know, faces and stuff, but what the hell are you going to do with it, is what I ask.
3778760	3781760	I just gave a suggestion of what they could do with it.
3781760	3784760	Other than, you know, shine it up and shove it up their ass.
3784760	3792760	Or better yet, when the hell are they going to do something with it, because the last I checked, Home still doesn't have trophy support in it.
3792760	3795760	What, that was announced, what, how many years ago?
3795760	3806760	That would be kind of neat if your avatar in Home smiled and frowned as you were smiling and frowning sitting there on the couch or whatever, or your face is just left open agape at the whole hamsters versus humans, you know, type thing.
3806760	3808760	That would be kind of cool.
3808760	3816760	But, you know, I always kind of think about how this stuff can be tracked towards exercise gaming, and maybe the game would be able to tell when I am, like, too tired to move on.
3816760	3829760	Like, you know, like that's the problem with one of these type of exercise games is that, you know, it doesn't really know how you're receiving the exercises, and a personal trainer can kind of tell, like, if you've had enough or if they can push you a little harder.
3829760	3839760	Games don't know very well how to do that, but maybe, you know, just maybe a game like this could tell based on your expression, like the, oh my god, like, you know, to stop giving you a hard time.
3839760	3852760	You know something else that actually occurred to me, and they were doing this as communication tools for quadriplegics, you know, especially people paralyzed from the neck down.
3852760	3863760	And, you know, another thing too, remember the mind controller, I think it was for an Atari system, that it read your facial expression to control the game?
3863760	3877760	Well, what if they did have games that relied on your expression or special type of interface that you would be able to, like, you know, if you blink to move one way or lean your head to the side to go one way, you know.
3877760	3880760	How about just a goddamn controller? Is that so difficult?
3880760	3881760	Why do we got to complicate things?
3881760	3893760	But, I mean, I was just saying that actually would be something, if they created a kind of interface in a lot of games that would read motion, like for people who really can't play games, you know, who might enjoy it.
3893760	3896760	Oh, so like making it more handicap accessible.
3896760	3897760	Exactly.
3897760	3898760	That might be kind of neat actually.
3898760	3908760	You know, if it's recognizing the motions of your face, the motions of your head, you could easily lean your head to the side to go one way, lean it to go the other way, lean forward, lean back.
3908760	3917760	You know, if it's reading eyebrows or your eyes, you can blink to jump or something or stick out your tongue to fart or something, I don't know.
3917760	3919760	Interesting. Stick out your tongue to fart. Really, Jamie.
3919760	3921760	I was thinking of a verb.
3921760	3922760	Okay.
3922760	3926760	You can do X with this part to do verb.
3926760	3931760	Dartetsuya in chat says, maybe that's what Nintendo's heart monitor thingy is for.
3931760	3936760	And I'm assuming he's referring to the exercise gaming.
3936760	3937760	Perhaps.
3937760	3939760	That could be part of it.
3939760	3944760	Yeah, I'm sure Wii Plus, Wii Fit Plus Plus will now support that as well.
3944760	3946760	Goody gumdrops.
3946760	3949760	Yeah, unfortunate.
3949760	3958760	Anyhow, we'll see what kind of games develop with this new technology, but for now we're going to talk about the games that are coming out right now as we travel the world with some release dates.
3958760	3968760	Yes, and we have wonderful games utilizing technology as well, including Sins of a Solar Empire Game of the Year Edition, which is coming out on PC this week.
3968760	3970760	Other fun stuff.
3970760	3971760	G-Force.
3971760	3974760	Okay, well maybe that's not fun, but it's a game.
3974760	3989760	G-Force is coming out as well on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, and PSP based on the animated hamster, not hamster, guinea pig secret agent movie.
3989760	3995760	Which, by the way, the PS3 and Xbox 360 are in 3D.
3995760	4005760	Rock Bandit Country Track Pack is coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii this week as well.
4005760	4018760	Also on Xbox 360 we have Watchmen The End is Nigh parts 1 and 2, and Watchmen The End is Nigh Complete on the PS3. Those are available as well.
4018760	4028760	Little King's Story, which is coming out on the Wii, and got nominated for best role- or not best role-playing game, best strategy game out of E3.
4028760	4032760	So that one should be pretty good, coming from Exceed.
4032760	4037760	And, I think there's not too much else here.
4037760	4054760	Yeah, looks like, of course, you know, it's not necessarily during the week, but Wii Sports Resort.
4054760	4058760	Actually, that's next week. Never mind, jumping ahead.
4058760	4062760	That's it. Oh, sorry, I completely missed this.
4062760	4067760	King of Fighters XII, you know, that's a little bit important. That's coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3.
4067760	4072760	And the week from today, Wii Sports Resort with MotionPlus will be available as well.
4072760	4074760	So, that's a big one.
4074760	4075760	Fun.
4075760	4080760	Alright, well, let's travel over to Japan and look at some of the Japanese release dates that are coming up.
4080760	4087760	Guess what? On the Xbox 360, you can finally get the Japanese version of 50 Cent, Blood on the Sand, comes out in Japan this week.
4087760	4092760	So, if you missed out on that gem, you can finally pick that up over there.
4092760	4094760	Bethesda is localizing that, I guess, for Japan.
4094760	4096760	50 yen, Blood on the Sand.
4096760	4097760	There you go.
4097760	4101760	Call of Juarez, Bound in Blood, also makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
4101760	4107760	As well as Devil May Cry 4, getting a price cut this week in Japan as it moves into the Platinum Collection over there.
4107760	4113760	Moving on to the PlayStation 3, 50 Cent, Blood on the Sand and Call of Juarez also drop there, as well as Devil May Cry 4.
4113760	4118760	But also, of note, Katamari Damacy Tribute makes its way out in Japan.
4118760	4120760	So, I'm sure there's some folks looking forward to that.
4120760	4124760	As well as a game called Toro to Morimori comes out as well.
4124760	4127760	I'm not sure what this game is.
4127760	4128760	Oh!
4128760	4132760	It's to celebrate the Doki demo issue series' 10th anniversary.
4132760	4136760	The game carries on after the memorable last scene of the first Doki de Mishuu game.
4136760	4140760	Toro continues to chase his dream to become a human after he left the player.
4140760	4146760	One day, Kuro tells the white cat about the memory record, which can grant any wish after you fill it with gratitude.
4146760	4148760	So, off Toro goes to help people.
4148760	4153760	So, that's a game that you can check out, I guess, if you want, on the PlayStation 3.
4153760	4155760	That's a very, very Japanese game.
4155760	4157760	It looks kind of cute. I'm trying to figure out what kind of game it is.
4157760	4159760	It looks very kind of adventure-like.
4159760	4163760	You know, I always thought that cat looked like he was straight out of, you know, Animal Crossing.
4163760	4165760	Hey, the game?
4165760	4168760	Wasn't that cat based off of doing emoticons and ASCII art?
4168760	4170760	It could be. It looks like it.
4170760	4172760	Yeah, I think it's the cat that was done off of that.
4172760	4175760	Hey, it comes with a clock for the PSP as well.
4175760	4178760	Oh, I have to have that. I love stuff that comes with stuff.
4178760	4180760	Exactly, right?
4180760	4182760	With stuff. Inside stuff.
4182760	4189760	Hey, well, actually, you know that my, uh, I bought that whole Cardcaptor Sakura Dreamcast thing because it came with a plate.
4189760	4190760	Nice.
4190760	4192760	And a fork and a spoon and a pillowcase.
4192760	4193760	Nice.
4193760	4196760	On the Nintendo Wii, Punch-Out! gets its release in Japan this week.
4196760	4198760	I was actually surprised to hear that they didn't have it first.
4198760	4200760	That kind of surprised me.
4200760	4204760	Uh, but another game that they got that we don't got, Dragon Ball.
4204760	4207760	Tekanishi Daibuken comes out this week.
4207760	4209760	We'll be having that soon enough.
4209760	4212760	Yes, if you're a big fan of Dragon Ball Z, there you go.
4212760	4214760	Your very own Wii game.
4214760	4216760	Enjoy that in Japan this week.
4216760	4218760	Moving on to the handhelds for a minute.
4218760	4224760	Actually, going back to PlayStation 2, some games get a price reduction this week.
4224760	4228760	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Musou Orochi get price reductions this week.
4228760	4231760	Uh, moving on, though, to the handhelds.
4231760	4235760	On the Nintendo DS, uh, just some accessories if you like Disney characters.
4235760	4237760	Mickey, Minnie, and Stitch, just some accessories.
4237760	4244760	Uh, but there's a new game coming out called Katakyuu Hitman Reborn DS Flame Rumble X.
4244760	4247760	It's a fighting game on the DS if you want to check that out.
4247760	4252760	Lastly, on the PSP, as I scroll on my list here to get to the PSP.
4252760	4256760	Um, just some price reductions.
4256760	4260760	Again, uh, Katakyuu Hitman Reborn Battle Arena gets a price reduction.
4260760	4262760	And Musou Orochi also gets a price reduction.
4262760	4264760	So, enjoy!
4264760	4266760	There you go, your Japanese release dates.
4266760	4267760	Let's move over to Europe.
4267760	4271760	Well, um, it's actually, again, kind of a slow week like last week was.
4271760	4275760	On the 22nd, we have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time re-shelled.
4275760	4277760	Yay!
4277760	4281760	Um, because that is one of my favorite turtle games ever.
4281760	4287760	Um, Shatter on the 23rd for PS3 and on the Wii Sports Resort.
4287760	4290760	Try saying that three times fast.
4290760	4291760	That's it.
4291760	4293760	Wii Sports Resort Resort.
4293760	4294760	See?
4294760	4297760	That's tough.
4297760	4299760	Hmm.
4299760	4301760	Um, so it's interesting.
4301760	4307760	There's a game that's been out already in Japan, Trash Panic, which is on the PlayStation Network.
4307760	4313760	It's getting a new version of that game, which is called 100 yen Gomibaku.
4313760	4320760	And what that is, is it's actually a pay-to-play PSN game.
4320760	4324760	And basically, it's going to work, you know, very similar to like a coin-up arcade game.
4324760	4328760	It's going to cost you 100 yen, which is about a dollar, to download.
4328760	4336760	And then it limits you to only three play sessions, at which point you have to pay another 100 yen to continue playing.
4336760	4345760	But, if you complete one of the two modes in that game, it unlocks a bonus in the full version of the game.
4345760	4349760	The steal mode will open up the same mode in the original game.
4349760	4355760	And clearing normal mode will also open up five home rewards.
4355760	4362760	And it's kind of interesting that they're putting out a game that you have to continue to pay to play.
4362760	4365760	I don't know. I wouldn't buy it.
4365760	4367760	Why not?
4367760	4372760	Why not? Because they have the other versions available where you just pay one fee, one time.
4372760	4378760	And, you know, once you're done with that, you can play the game as much as you want.
4378760	4384760	Haven't people been talking about wanting this type of format for a game for a long time, though? You know what I mean?
4384760	4385760	I suppose.
4385760	4394760	You know, on Xbox Live Arcade, wouldn't the consumer really like to see, especially with some of these retro arcade releases that you pay $5 for and then play twice?
4394760	4402760	Wouldn't it be better to have, you know, a token type system where you just pay a quarter to play it once and then, you know, see if you want to play it again from there?
4402760	4405760	And if you like it a lot, then you can just buy it.
4405760	4408760	No. Because that's what the demos are for. And the demos are free.
4408760	4415760	So why the hell would I pay, you know, even a dollar for a game that I can demo for free and realize if I want it or not?
4415760	4423760	And you know what? It's my own damn fault if I buy a game that I think I'm gonna like and I play it a few times and then just leave it, you know, to rot in my, you know, game collection.
4423760	4441760	As I have before with Doom and Duke Nukem 3D and Worms and Pac-Man and Dig Dug and all those other goddamn Namco games and other weird obscure Xbox Live Arcade games that I buy because they're cool and then I stop playing them.
4441760	4444760	So, you know what? Too bad.
4444760	4451760	But hey, if you want to, you know, throw away your money like that, I'm sure that, you know, Sony will be willing to take it.
4451760	4457760	But Sony doesn't release demos for all of their games either. Would you feel differently if you didn't have the demos to go off of?
4457760	4462760	Yeah, I would feel differently because that would, you know, make me feel like that they're trying to rip me off.
4462760	4466760	And I don't like being ripped off. And they have a demo for this game.
4466760	4472760	I don't know. I'm a little bit iffy on it. I think in some ways, you know, demos can be very limiting sometimes.
4472760	4475760	I mean, some of those demos in Xbox Live Marketplace, you play one screen and you're done.
4475760	4482760	Like, I would like a feature where I can play, like, a couple times to try to get the achievements, but once I've paid out, like, a dollar, I don't want to try anymore.
4482760	4491760	You know, I think it would be kind of cool to have a game that kind of rewards you, you know, that I can kind of pay as you go instead of dropping five, ten dollars on it.
4491760	4495760	And then, you know, I realize this isn't Xbox Live, but I'm making that comparison anyway. Whatever.
4495760	4497760	Yara should pay me.
4497760	4500760	Or that. Who knows.
4500760	4503760	Yara should pay everybody and apologize for its existence.
4503760	4508760	No, seriously, they should pay the consumer because it's an ad.
4508760	4513760	And a horrible game. Mainly the horrible game is why they should have to pay out to everybody.
4513760	4522760	Uh, BlackWolfinChat says, I would say about 90% of my DVD-based game collection I don't play anymore either. Would you consider that a waste of money, too?
4522760	4528760	No. Because you don't play it anymore. You did play it at a time. You don't just buy stuff and not play it.
4528760	4530760	And who cares, you know?
4530760	4532760	I've had those games I played, like, once.
4532760	4535760	Okay, Fusion Frenzy 2, case in point. I bought that game.
4535760	4538760	I still have a wrapped version of Galarian's Ash.
4538760	4544760	Wow. Played Fusion Frenzy 2 once, said to myself, the fuck was I thinking? And never played it again.
4544760	4546760	Yeah, I could've told you that.
4546760	4547760	Whatever. Oops.
4547760	4550760	And I wanted to play through Galarian's Ash because you made people's heads explode.
4550760	4551760	Well, then you should have played it.
4551760	4553760	Well, maybe I will. I still have it.
4553760	4555760	And I have an old PS3.
4555760	4557760	You can always go back someday. I guess that's the thing.
4557760	4559760	I actually have an old PS3, so it'll play it.
4559760	4565760	I mean, seriously, nowadays with the internet and everything, I mean, hell, even back in the days where it was just gaming magazines,
4565760	4569760	I mean, you're not completely oblivious to whether a game is good or not.
4569760	4573760	You have sites revealing them. You have friends that have played them.
4573760	4577760	You can try demos. You can hear the buzz about it.
4577760	4584760	It's just, you know, I don't think this pricing model, unless you're just going to put out these games and have no ability to buy them,
4584760	4592760	and you just pay 25 cents or whatever, a pop. But even then, arcade games are meant to take your quarters.
4592760	4597760	I know that. And you know what? I'm not going to play a PC game that's meant to take my quarters.
4597760	4601760	That's like playing an indie casino. I mean, that's just going to take my money.
4601760	4604760	Bobby goes on in chat. Bobby Black Wolf says,
4604760	4608760	But it's a waste of money to buy an XBLA game that you only played a few times and then not anymore?
4608760	4610760	Sounds like a double standard, just saying.
4610760	4614760	Yeah, it is a waste of money to buy an XBLA arcade game that you're going to play a couple times.
4614760	4619760	But you know what, though? I mean, if you think that you got your money's worth out of it, then that's fine.
4619760	4631760	But let's take, for example, if you were to play the arcade version of Contra or some difficult shooter like that.
4631760	4642760	Okay, I die quite often in those games. Frustrating level. So there goes my dollar really quick.
4642760	4648760	And then by the time I actually play it enough, that would be like buying the game all over.
4648760	4655760	I don't know. I don't see the point of really... unless maybe as a bonus or something, if you did really well in the game,
4655760	4661760	then you would unlock the full game or something like that and you'd keep it. Like, you know, kind of gambling almost.
4661760	4666760	Black Wolf goes on. I want to move on topics, but I'll read this other little debate here.
4666760	4670760	Okay, so XBLA game that you played a couple of times equals waste of money.
4670760	4678760	DVD-based game that you played probably six times as much and only played a couple of times equals not a waste of money.
4678760	4680760	No, it's still a waste of money.
4680760	4686760	I think, though, sometimes you go into these games and you look back and you go,
4686760	4691760	wow, I really wasted my money. That's how I feel about BitBoy. I paid six bucks for that game and I'm like,
4691760	4693760	you know what, this game, that was a waste of money.
4693760	4700760	Or like Left 4 Dead for me. I bought the game and I considered it a waste of money because I don't have time to play it
4700760	4703760	and I just don't really want to play it right now.
4703760	4708760	But that's just the risk of entertainment sometimes, that you're not always going to be entertained.
4708760	4715760	For instance, I've gone to a play that I spent 30, 40 bucks on tickets for and was not entertained and was like,
4715760	4720760	well, that was a waste of money. By the way, it was the Jesus Christ Superstar production here in Sacramento.
4720760	4726760	It was terrible years ago. Let's see, what else was it? Movies all the time. Oh my God, there's so many movies.
4726760	4729760	You pay $10 to go see the movie and then you're like, wow, that was a waste of my time.
4729760	4736760	Especially when movies cost as much as they do, that's really tough when you pay that much to see a movie and then it sucks.
4736760	4739760	And then add the food cost into that as well. That can be quite an investment.
4739760	4744760	And I even think you get more of a value out of a video game than you do in a movie.
4744760	4751760	No, see, now I knew you were going to say that because, oh, an Xbox Live Arcade game, you get X number of hours of entertainment out of.
4751760	4756760	In a movie, you get two hours of entertainment for the same price.
4756760	4758760	Go ahead.
4758760	4761760	But my thing is, though, is that's apples and oranges.
4761760	4769760	I mean, a movie, you're going to be entertained at some level. I mean, you're not going to be retarded and actually just go to a movie that you're not going to like.
4769760	4775760	And with a movie, if you really, really don't like it, you could probably go back to the front counter and get your money back.
4775760	4781760	You'd be surprised. I've gone to movies where I let friends or significant others pick the movie and I didn't like it.
4781760	4788760	Well, that's your fault for trusting someone else's judgment and letting them steer the vehicle, I guess.
4788760	4793760	But that's like letting my wife pick a movie or something like that sometimes.
4793760	4798760	You know, and here's the thing, though, is that some movies, yes, you can get more of a value out of DVDs.
4798760	4802760	You know, there's some DVDs like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion or Clue.
4802760	4808760	I've easily watched those DVDs, or Rocky Horror Picture Show, shit, I've watched those DVDs easily 20 times each.
4808760	4811760	You know, I would definitely say I got my money's worth out of those.
4811760	4814760	Just like some video games, I probably only spend a little bit of money on.
4814760	4820760	The original Geometry Wars, $5. Oh my god, I spent so much time on that game, right?
4820760	4822760	Or Super Mario Kart back on the old Super Nintendo.
4822760	4827760	But then there's other games I bought that I played a couple times where I was like, you know what, I didn't get the value out of it.
4827760	4832760	But that, like, what are some games I bought and played one time on Xbox Live Arcade?
4832760	4837760	Cloning Clyde, I think I played once and I bought it.
4837760	4840760	You know, eh, probably not the best choice to spend my money.
4840760	4843760	But that's part of the risk.
4843760	4847760	It really, when you look at it, I mean, it's good for them to try different price models.
4847760	4851760	It's bad if they're going to try to force you into those other price models.
4851760	4858760	You know, opening options is a good idea, but forcing you down really ridiculous options, that's another thing.
4858760	4868760	And the way I see this game is more of like a bonus game that you can play to unlock other stuff in the other game.
4868760	4874760	So it's kind of like an add-on that you just pay to play.
4874760	4877760	Alright, well let's move on past this topic.
4877760	4882760	I just, you know, I think there's a lot more to be seen on this topic.
4882760	4885760	It really depends on how some of these other games do.
4885760	4890760	It's going to be interesting to see the precedent that some of these things might set.
4890760	4892760	Anyhow, let's move on to another story.
4892760	4897760	And speaking of places you might go to buy games, Microsoft apparently is going to be launching retail stores this fall.
4897760	4899760	That's right, you know, I have the Apple store in the mall.
4899760	4901760	Guess what's coming? The Microsoft store.
4901760	4904760	Apparently the first stores are going to be launching this fall.
4904760	4907760	I haven't heard where yet, but I guess they're coming.
4907760	4911760	And I don't know if that means you can actually take your Xbox 360 in there and get it repaired.
4911760	4913760	That would be kind of cool though, wouldn't it?
4913760	4915760	Ambitious though, don't you think?
4915760	4917760	No, I doubt it that you would be able to repair it at the store.
4917760	4919760	But they are opening up storefronts.
4919760	4921760	And just in time for Windows 7, right?
4921760	4923760	Yeah.
4923760	4932760	So, I guess, let's see, this was confirmed at the worldwide partner conference in New Orleans by the chief operating officer, Kevin Turner.
4932760	4935760	But they haven't, I still don't see where the first store is going to be.
4935760	4937760	I bet you though one of them is in Seattle.
4937760	4939760	Yeah, probably.
4939760	4940760	That's probably a gimme.
4940760	4944760	Probably like Seattle, San Francisco, New York, L.A.
4944760	4945760	You know, major cities.
4945760	4947760	Well, competition is healthy, right?
4947760	4948760	Exactly.
4948760	4953760	By the way, something else to note, Microsoft had actually hired a former Walmart executive, David Porter.
4953760	4956760	And he's going to be the corporate vice president of these retail stores.
4956760	4958760	That move was made back in February.
4958760	4960760	So you've kind of seen this coming for a long time.
4960760	4962760	I think these stores could be interesting.
4962760	4963760	I think competition is healthy.
4963760	4973760	I think especially, you know, as much as I do enjoy Apple and I like the iPhone and stuff, I do think some of their shit is obscenely priced.
4973760	4981760	And when you get out there in the mall, a laptop that's $400, like the one that I bought at Fry's, although sadly in a Microsoft store at the mall, they're probably not going to go that cheap.
4981760	4988760	But when you get these really cheap laptops next to the Apple laptops, it's going to really drive competition, I think, a little bit.
4988760	4989760	Just a little.
4989760	4991760	I've been in Apple stores a few times.
4991760	4993760	My God, and you didn't melt?
4993760	4995760	Yeah, I almost did.
4995760	4997760	Short exposures.
4997760	4999760	But I hated being in them.
4999760	5001760	They're blinding.
5001760	5007760	I hated being in them because it reminded me of the whole Gateway PC stores that they used to have.
5007760	5012760	Basically, you go in and you have to make an appointment to be helped.
5012760	5013760	I'm sorry. That's crap.
5013760	5015760	Because they're so popular.
5015760	5017760	Oh, we'll hire more employees in.
5017760	5018760	Seriously.
5018760	5022760	Oh, well, you can't blame us if the demand's really high.
5022760	5025760	Oh, well, fuck you. Hire more employees.
5025760	5026760	Well, look, I feel-
5026760	5033760	If a restaurant is short staffed, do you go back to that restaurant when you have to wait to be served?
5033760	5034760	Fuck that shit.
5034760	5035760	I do.
5035760	5036760	If the food's really good, I do.
5036760	5037760	If the food's really good, I'll go.
5037760	5042760	Okay, well, if they dress the food up really nice but the food is actually really inferior to cheaper food-
5042760	5044760	No, I wouldn't go back to that restaurant.
5044760	5045760	Okay, good.
5045760	5048760	I'm glad you see things my way.
5048760	5050760	Anyhow, but this is an opinion, not a fact.
5050760	5052760	But anyway, you know what, though?
5052760	5059760	I think one thing that I do like about the stores, despite your complaint about them, I like the place that there's a place you can take your apple into to get fixed up.
5059760	5064760	That there's a place where they have these classes that show off how to use the Apple hardware and software.
5064760	5072760	I think it's kind of neat that it ends up being a centralized place for Apple, despite the fact that the stores might charge a little more than you might find if you would just shop around.
5072760	5075760	And the fact that they blind you, it's not a bad concept.
5075760	5076760	They really do blind you.
5076760	5078760	Wait, why would you need classes to use an apple?
5078760	5080760	I mean, I thought it was supposed to be user-friendly.
5080760	5085760	Look, I'm talking about, like, not me. I'm talking about older people that want to- or some of the software that they put out for it.
5085760	5090760	Like, maybe you've always wanted to use GarageBand, but you're just not sure how to begin, and it's not like you're going to read the manual.
5090760	5092760	I think it's kind of cool that you could take a class on that.
5092760	5100760	You know what, if we're going to make our Pots and Pans song, we're going to need an audio maker to do it, so we might have to use GarageBand, Loki.
5100760	5101760	No, we're not.
5101760	5103760	Adobe makes a really good program already.
5103760	5104760	Fine, fine, fine.
5104760	5107760	I love Creative Suite for-
5107760	5109760	I'll have to take a class on it, because I don't know how to use it.
5109760	5112760	I know how to use it. Adobe Audition, that's it.
5112760	5116760	Well, yeah, but this is the program that they replaced Audition with, and it works just the same.
5116760	5117760	Oh, interesting.
5117760	5118760	Yeah.
5118760	5122760	Well, we use it to tape our podcast, but that's it. Anyway.
5122760	5128760	Alright, so I'm curious to see what happens with these retail stores. I will definitely check them out when they're available.
5128760	5130760	All this new stuff's getting on my nerves.
5130760	5131760	Why is that?
5131760	5135760	Just... my poor brain is... living in a cave.
5135760	5140760	Living in this economy, though, it's nice to hear about stores opening up as opposed to stores closing.
5140760	5143760	I sort of have a feeling that it's not going to last.
5143760	5150760	And you know what, though? A Microsoft store going into a mall, that's one less spot that they can put a Hot Topic.
5150760	5151760	Whatever.
5151760	5152760	They can only have one Hot Topic per hour.
5152760	5153760	Or Cinnabon.
5153760	5154760	You know they're going to have.
5154760	5157760	Hey, I like Cinnabon. That's delicious.
5157760	5161760	Did you know, by the way, at Walmart this week, I was actually at Walmart, and I was looking at candles.
5161760	5163760	They have candles that smell like Cinnabon.
5163760	5166760	That's just a horrible cock tease right there.
5166760	5168760	It needs to be real Cinnabon.
5168760	5171760	But you can get the Cinnabon or like the Snickerdoodles.
5171760	5172760	I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
5172760	5176760	Actually, at Cracker Barrel, the last time I was...
5176760	5177760	Which we don't have here.
5177760	5186760	But they had a Cinnamon Monkey Bread scented one, which is like super delicious.
5186760	5188760	Monkey Bread's hecka good.
5188760	5189760	You can get that at the grocery store.
5189760	5193760	Anyway, sorry. Orange Lounge Foodio. Let's move into the classic game of the week.
5193760	5196760	It's the part of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane.
5196760	5199760	And Dark Sakura picks a game that she thinks, you know what?
5199760	5200760	You guys should all be playing this game.
5200760	5202760	Why the hell are you not playing this game?
5202760	5203760	God, really?
5203760	5204760	It's the classic game of the week.
5204760	5210760	And I believe tonight, in a little bit of a twist, it's the classic games of the week, correct?
5210760	5211760	Yes.
5211760	5215760	Alright, so Dark Sakura, tell us what games you gotta be playing this week.
5215760	5223760	Well, it really is specifically to one game, but I have to mention the rest of the series.
5223760	5226760	So I'm starting it off with Crush Pinball.
5226760	5235760	It actually all starts with Alien Crush, which still is probably the better of all of that series.
5235760	5239760	Sorry, there's a little bit of background noise in this particular movie.
5239760	5249760	There's music here.
5249760	5251760	Wasn't Extra Per Addicted a good idea?
5251760	5253760	Yes. Yes, very much so.
5253760	5255760	They released a remake, I think, too. I don't remember that.
5255760	5256760	We'll do that.
5256760	5257760	Alright, sorry.
5257760	5265760	But yeah, this one is, we'll start off with Alien Crush, which basically, it's a pinball game.
5265760	5272760	It, you know, it actually seems almost like it was themed off of Alien, but you're fighting the aliens with a pinball and you have to smack them down.
5272760	5276760	You've got your flippers, your multi-levels, hidden rooms, different things.
5276760	5281760	And you can also play two different music tracks and you have a fastball or a slowball.
5281760	5284760	Really, it's very simple.
5284760	5287760	The sequel to this was Devil's Crush.
5287760	5288760	It's like pinball.
5288760	5293760	It is pinball. It's just a, you know, video pinball.
5293760	5294760	It's the joke.
5294760	5295760	Yeah, yeah, yeah, really.
5295760	5305760	This one is, though, Devil's Crush, or as it was in Japan, Devil Crash, was the next in the series.
5305760	5310760	It had an occult theme. It has demons and skeletons and everything.
5310760	5321760	It also is on Virtual Console, as is, yeah, as is Alien Crush is also on Virtual Console.
5321760	5330760	The Mega Drive version was called Dragon's Fury and that did get a release and it had a sequel.
5330760	5332760	I'm playing some Devil's Crush right now.
5332760	5333760	Okay.
5333760	5341760	The Mega Drive sequel was Dragon's Revenge, which actually we just found out our cart died, so we have to find another one of it.
5341760	5344760	I thought this one had some cool music.
5344760	5346760	But, um, Devil's Crush.
5346760	5353760	And then there was one that we never got in America that I have actually played. I have played it at somebody's house.
5353760	5356760	I do not remember when or who, but I know I have played it.
5356760	5360760	And it's called Jockey Crush. J-A-K-I.
5360760	5370760	And it came out on the Super Famicom in 1992 and this one has very Super Nintendo music.
5370760	5384760	Listen to a little.
5384760	5389760	It's probably too violent for Nintendo standards. It does have that kind of demon-y sort of look.
5389760	5400760	Well, in the background of the stage there's actually a type of ogre called a jockey.
5400760	5404760	It really is very heavy on the demon theme with this one.
5404760	5409760	But it's really fun. I actually really remember liking this game a lot.
5409760	5414760	And it's a little on the difficult side from what I remember.
5414760	5419760	After that, now also, by the way, I did go looking for this on eBay and it was $54.
5419760	5422760	Which I considered.
5422760	5428760	After that, though, we got a WiiWare version, Alien Crush Returns.
5428760	5432760	And that one is...
5432760	5436760	I'm trying not to make noises in the microphone.
5436760	5442760	But it's a somewhat sequel remake to Alien Crush.
5442760	5446760	Which is considered definitely part of the Crush series.
5446760	5452760	You use the Wiimote with this one and so you can tilt the table and you have action balls.
5452760	5455760	Which just makes me laugh, all kinds of stuff.
5455760	5460760	And you have a six-stage story mode and boss battles and online multiplayer and leaderboards.
5460760	5463760	So it's pretty neat.
5463760	5465760	This game's kind of freaky.
5465760	5468760	Yeah, that one's actually really cool.
5468760	5474760	I do remember... Actually, we might want to link the chat room on this particular video.
5474760	5482760	Because this is actually, I think, one of the graphically better Super Nintendo titles.
5482760	5485760	You see how the...
5485760	5489760	I really think it's a fantastic, fantastic game.
5489760	5491760	I just linked it there in chat, by the way.
5491760	5495760	But it really had a lot to do with it. It was fairly difficult, as I recall.
5495760	5499760	I've only played it twice, but I do remember playing it.
5499760	5501760	Alright.
5501760	5504760	So yeah, it's definitely all about Crush Pinball.
5504760	5508760	Really, people with a Wii, you have no excuse not to...
5508760	5511760	Unless you're dirt poor, then why do you have a Wii?
5511760	5516760	But Alien Crush and Devil's Crush, you can get on the Wii.
5516760	5522760	You can get the remake Alien Crush Returns on WiiWare.
5522760	5526760	Jackie Crush emulator.
5526760	5529760	I really have no problems saying get a SNES emulator and play it.
5529760	5532760	It's really worthwhile playing.
5532760	5534760	And then, of course, there's all the Mega Drive versions.
5534760	5538760	So really, there's multiple ways to play any of the games in the series.
5538760	5540760	I say go for it.
5540760	5541760	Alright.
5541760	5543760	And I'm sure X-Tifer will agree.
5543760	5545760	Yes. There you have it, guys.
5545760	5546760	He played a lot.
5546760	5547760	He played a lot.
5547760	5549760	Every day I came home from work, he was playing freaking Alien Crush.
5549760	5552760	Not even the remake, the old school TurboGrafx one when I downloaded it on the Wii.
5552760	5553760	There you have it, guys.
5553760	5557760	Your classic game of the week is the Crush series, starting off with Alien Crush.
5557760	5559760	Enjoy.
5559760	5560760	Or don't.
5560760	5561760	See if we care.
5561760	5564760	Alright, we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break
5564760	5566760	with some rapid fire news and some more discussion,
5566760	5570760	including our independent developers being shut out of Xbox Live Arcade.
5570760	5573760	Make way for the Avatar premium clothing.
5573760	5577760	We're going to be talking about some of those changes to Xbox Live when we come back for a quick break.
5577760	5579760	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5579760	5590760	Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, July the 19th of 2009,
5590760	5595760	where we are taping episode number 332 of our little show that we do here every week.
5595760	5599760	We tape live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
5599760	5603760	If you want to join in the fun, we started taping Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time,
5603760	5605760	9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.
5605760	5610760	We talked a lot about some of the other gaming news going on in the world in our last section,
5610760	5616760	including news about the Conduit being easy and not selling much, being easy to hack, that is.
5616760	5620760	We talked about the Rock Band Network, talked about Microsoft retail stores,
5620760	5623760	and now we're going to talk about some rapid fire news so quickly,
5623760	5627760	some stories that we're not going to spend a whole lot of time on but want to get out there anyway.
5627760	5633760	Alright, Fallout 3 PlayStation download content didn't quite come out during June,
5633760	5636760	but now will be coming out by the end of September.
5636760	5639760	This was an announcement from the PlayStation blog saying that, of course,
5639760	5644760	the content is releasing later than originally expected, and to make up for it,
5644760	5648760	they're going to have the first two download packs will be Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta,
5648760	5654760	which is the brand new, actually the last, I think, download content coming to Fallout 3.
5654760	5659760	Also, something else coming to the PlayStation Network would be PC Engine games.
5659760	5662760	Yes, they're kind of pulling a little bit of a virtual console there.
5662760	5667760	Sony has announced that four PC Engine or Turbografx-16 titles
5667760	5671760	will be coming to the store actually last week,
5671760	5674760	and this would include Bomberman 94, New Adventure Island,
5674760	5679760	Sengoku, Mahjong, and Devil's Crush, each for 600 yen.
5679760	5683760	Kind of ironic that we were just talking about Devil's Crush, actually.
5683760	5688760	And then finally, Sony has trademarked Ad Hoc Party in the US,
5688760	5691760	and Ad Hoc Party was a service originally only available in Japan,
5691760	5696760	and basically it would allow PSP owners to play Ad Hoc games over the internet.
5696760	5700760	Usually Ad Hoc games, of course, obviously only can play with people in your same room.
5700760	5704760	But now you'll be able to play with your friends over the internet, which is pretty awesome.
5704760	5712760	Because we used to get it on with the Ad Hoc gaming with the PSP Grand Theft Auto titles.
5712760	5717760	That's kind of cool. So any PSP title that has Ad Hoc play, you'll now be able to do on the internet?
5717760	5718760	Yes.
5718760	5720760	That's actually kind of good. That's really good for the PSP.
5720760	5721760	Yeah.
5721760	5723760	That's cool. But you'd have to have your PlayStation 3 on while you do it or something?
5723760	5724760	Yes.
5724760	5726760	That's cool. I like that idea.
5726760	5731760	Alright, well, let's go through some more rapid-fire news, including for our music game fans.
5731760	5733760	I'm sure you're still following BeatMania 2DX.
5733760	5737760	Well, BeatMania 2DX Empress is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.
5737760	5741760	Keep in mind it is a Japanese series only. They don't come out here in America.
5741760	5743760	A lot of our hardcore music game fans, they import them.
5743760	5748760	But the important news about this, it is the last BeatMania coming to the PlayStation 2.
5748760	5751760	Honestly, I'm surprised it is coming to the PlayStation 2.
5751760	5756760	It is very interesting, and I don't know if that means maybe future versions will come out on another console.
5756760	5760760	I don't know. But Konami is going to be releasing the game with what's called a Premium Best Disc set.
5760760	5764760	It contains new songs and tracks, especially for the home version.
5764760	5769760	180 songs on this, so if you're a BeatMania fan, this is probably the version to get,
5769760	5774760	because I'm assuming this is just going to be going out to PlayStation 2 with a bang.
5774760	5778760	By the way, it should be noted though, this isn't the last game that's coming out in arcades.
5778760	5783760	BeatMania 2DX 17 Serious, like the satellite radio, not why so serious,
5783760	5788760	but BeatMania 2DX 17 Serious has actually been location testing.
5788760	5789760	You mean like the Dogstar?
5789760	5791760	Yes, that's really where it gets its name from.
5791760	5793760	Probably most people know it as satellite radio.
5793760	5797760	And not for like, seriously, they're releasing a 17th version of this game?
5797760	5800760	Well, it's interesting though, I hadn't heard of any hardware upgrades,
5800760	5805760	so if this series is coming out to PlayStation 3, I don't know what's going to happen in the future.
5805760	5810760	But anyhow, BeatMania 2DX 16 Empress and Premium Best is going to set you back 7,980 yen.
5810760	5816760	That's 86 bucks on October 15th in Japan, so plan on paying about $99 to import it over here probably.
5816760	5819760	Marvel vs. Capcom is going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.
5819760	5821760	The date was a little bit of a mystery, but now we know.
5821760	5825760	August 13th and $15 is how much it's going to set you back on the PlayStation 3.
5825760	5830760	That's a full two weeks, by the way, after the Xbox Live Arcade version.
5830760	5831760	Sad.
5831760	5836760	By the way, this is also going to be the same date that a retail version of the game comes out.
5836760	5841760	It's $5 more, but apparently the DVD that the game comes on will have some wallpapers, a manual,
5841760	5848760	one month of free access to what they call Marvel Digital Comics, and 2,000 Capcom Unity points.
5848760	5852760	However, it should be noted that the retail pack not confirmed,
5852760	5855760	but that is the date that the retail pack was rumored to be coming out.
5855760	5858760	Hey, some rewards if you're a Nintendo member.
5858760	5862760	Finally, we were waiting for some of this stuff from Japan, but now there's some good stuff coming out over here.
5862760	5868760	If you're a Platinum member, you can actually get a downloadable version of Punch-Out called Doc Lewis's Punch-Out.
5868760	5871760	Yes, you want to fight your trainer?
5871760	5875760	He won't just steal your bike. He will knock you out.
5875760	5882760	And also a Mario hat. You can actually get a replica of the Mario hat that you can wear to cons everywhere up and down the coast.
5882760	5885760	That WiiWare game will be leaked out the same day.
5885760	5888760	If you're a Gold member, you can at least get the Club Nintendo original calendar.
5888760	5891760	It's a little wall calendar. You can get something kind of cute.
5891760	5894760	So there you go. If you're a Platinum or a Gold member.
5894760	5899760	Now, I'm not sure exactly what you have to do to qualify for each one.
5899760	5900760	I imagine it just depends on your purchases.
5900760	5903760	It's just how many points you get from that.
5903760	5907760	You know, I was registering all my Nintendo purchases on Nintendo.com a while ago.
5907760	5912760	It requires you also to register purchases to review the games that you've done.
5912760	5918760	You know, answer little surveys and then add other surveys available that you could do.
5918760	5921760	Interesting. Well, hey, free game. Not going to complain.
5921760	5923760	I wonder if you have to own the original Punch-Out to...
5923760	5924760	No, it's a WiiWare game.
5924760	5926760	Cool. So maybe I'll check that out.
5926760	5930760	Because I never did buy Punch-Out on the Wii, although maybe I ought to. I don't know.
5930760	5934760	Well, there you go. Some rapid-fire news from me. Jamie?
5934760	5941760	Well, there's a Swedish group called Opeth that said on their website that...
5941760	5949760	They basically said that there's going to be a PSP version of Saints Row because their music is being featured in it.
5949760	5955760	They're quoted in saying, expect it to hit streets around March 2010.
5955760	5957760	THQ hasn't said anything about this.
5957760	5963760	I'm not surprised. They were working on a PSP version of the game, I think since back to the original Saints Row.
5963760	5968760	Maybe even Saints Row 2, but I know that was coming, so that's awesome.
5968760	5972760	Well, guess what's coming back. Where's Waldo?
5972760	5975760	Aw, I was hoping it was Pet Rocks.
5975760	5981760	No. There is actually Where's Waldo? The Fantastic Journey.
5981760	5986760	So you look for Waldo and his buddies and stuff in the books.
5986760	5998760	And it has four multiplayer mode power-ups, so you can actually hide what you're looking for from the other people and different things.
5998760	6001760	And it's in development for PC, Mac, Wii, and DS.
6001760	6004760	Will you get to find Wilma too?
6004760	6007760	Yes, probably. I think you can find a bunch of different things.
6007760	6012760	I've actually seen screenshots for it, and it's exactly what you would think.
6012760	6014760	Where's Waldo? But a digital version of it.
6014760	6019760	You know what's funny? I actually played this game, and I'm still looking for a good game.
6019760	6022760	It's supposed to be coming out in September.
6022760	6030760	Also, for some news on Dragon Quest IX, the rumor is that there's going to be some downloadable content.
6030760	6045760	It was actually hinted about from a rumor from NeoGAF that said it was supposed to be involved in that, and that it was going to be big, but oh well.
6045760	6051760	You know what's funny? I would definitely think Where's Waldo is going to be the game of September.
6051760	6055760	Screw Beatles, Rock Band, Guitar Hero 5, Halo 3, ODST.
6055760	6058760	I'm so glad they're making a sequel to Where's Waldo that was on the Super Nintendo.
6058760	6062760	I don't know if you've ever played this game. Fucking garbage. It is the most garbage.
6062760	6067760	Actually, I've played games that were less fun than Where's Waldo, Yaris being one of them.
6067760	6071760	But there are games that are really bad. Where's Waldo ranks among the worst.
6071760	6075760	What ever happened to the good Adver games?
6075760	6077760	There were good Adver games?
6077760	6079760	Yes, there was. Cool Spot. Remember Cool Spot?
6079760	6081760	Okay, Cool Spot. Okay, I'll give you that.
6081760	6085760	That was an awesome game. Yo! Noid was okay. It was a little weird.
6085760	6088760	I think a game out of McDonalds. McKids was a game.
6088760	6090760	I don't remember that one. There was a McKids. I know there was.
6090760	6092760	There was a Domino's game. Oh no, yeah, you said that.
6092760	6096760	There was a game for, um, uh, what else was there?
6096760	6100760	There was, um, one other big one I can't think of.
6100760	6103760	I mean, if you think about it though, half those cartoon games on NES, like DuckTales and all that,
6103760	6107760	were just Advers for the cartoons. Yeah. And so forth.
6107760	6112760	Why? There was another one I can't think of. It just escapes me.
6112760	6116760	I can't think of it. Grrr. Maybe somebody in chat will say.
6116760	6120760	Although we just had a net split in chat, so maybe they won't say. I don't know. We'll see.
6120760	6122760	Or maybe they'll say and we'll never find out.
6122760	6125760	Exactly. Oh well.
6125760	6131760	So, oh well. Let's move on with some more news. Less Adver gaming and more news.
6131760	6139760	Yes, let's talk about buying stuff and, you know, Microsoft, we kind of knew this was coming
6139760	6144760	with the whole premium content for avatars. The Cheetos game. Thank you.
6144760	6148760	It was a Cheetos game. Really? Sorry. Yep.
6148760	6153760	There was a Chester the Cheetah game. It was absolute trash, but it was out there.
6153760	6158760	Well, I was talking about good, you know, tie-in games and, I mean, the cool spot was awesome.
6158760	6163760	I love that game. Anyways, um, so yeah, premium content's coming for the avatars.
6163760	6170760	Of course, this is via the avatar store and you will actually be able to purchase new wardrobe items,
6170760	6176760	including one that they are showing a screenshot for, which reveals a steampunk collection.
6176760	6181760	And they have different items that you can buy for like $2 each.
6181760	6186760	And this one made me kind of giggle a little bit. It's a steampunk brown jacket and bust.
6186760	6192760	And it's funny because she's busty. So, you know, I'm assuming that they're talking about Bussier,
6192760	6198760	but I'm just going to leave it at bust. So you're actually buying breasts in this as well. That's awesome.
6198760	6210760	Um, so yeah. Or as Destructoid calls it, Microsoft Moon Dollars. I love that. 160 Microsoft Moon Dollars.
6210760	6213760	I think that's a joke because they're not really worth anything, you know?
6213760	6214760	I know, I know.
6214760	6218760	You just pay them to the evil empire and then hope that they release something you want.
6218760	6223760	Yeah, so basically you're buying more virtual clothing. And it's neat, I guess.
6223760	6227760	I mean, after all, I am a person that bought clothing in home.
6227760	6234760	But to be fair, I'm wearing that clothing forever now. I will be forever Santa Claus.
6234760	6237760	So that's the way things go.
6237760	6240760	Aw, Loki. You're forever Santa Claus. That's cute.
6240760	6246760	By the way, I just wanted to say in chat, hey, you could do some advert clothes. Why not?
6246760	6252760	But we forgot the most obvious. Dark Tetsuya reminded us of the best advert game to come out in quite some time.
6252760	6254760	Sneak King. How could we forget?
6254760	6257760	That was the creepiest crazy shit ever.
6257760	6259760	They need to do more of that kind of stuff.
6259760	6263760	I know, they do need to do more of those. I think those were really popular, too.
6263760	6269760	Actually, I think they were. Were they selling at GameStop for more than the five dollars they cost originally?
6269760	6270760	No.
6270760	6271760	I thought they did.
6271760	6275760	No, they're not worth anything now. In fact, I just sold some of mine back because I wasn't playing them.
6275760	6276760	Did you really?
6276760	6279760	Yeah, I have one left that I forgot to sell back.
6279760	6282760	I bought all three and I played them and I was like, wow, these suck.
6282760	6285760	So what do you think about paying for clothes on Xbox Live?
6285760	6290760	I probably won't do it. The only thing that's kind of interesting about this, it's not even necessarily this.
6290760	6294760	It's basically the reward clothing that you get for certain achievements. That's cool.
6294760	6295760	Yeah, I like that idea.
6295760	6299760	This I'm not even interested in. Honestly, I have never changed.
6299760	6305760	Maybe a couple times changed the clothes on my avatar, but I'm kind of happy with what they are now.
6305760	6307760	I don't really give a shit.
6307760	6312760	I tried to go in there and update my avatar and I didn't really see a lot of new stuff that I wanted to wear.
6312760	6317760	A lot of it's really out there and I like my avatar to kind of look like me, although it really looks nothing like me.
6317760	6319760	I try to make it at least kind of close.
6319760	6323760	Dark Soccer's looks a lot like her, actually. It's kind of freaky.
6323760	6324760	Dan's looks like him.
6324760	6326760	Loki's doesn't really look like him, either.
6326760	6328760	It's as close as I could get.
6328760	6332760	A little bit. It makes it look like you have a lot more facial hair than you actually do.
6332760	6333760	Yeah.
6333760	6336760	I think is the weird thing about it. It kind of looks like it. It's darker.
6336760	6337760	There's no in-between.
6337760	6339760	Yeah, that's true. That's the problem with it.
6339760	6345760	Anyhow, I'm cool with the reward clothes, but I wouldn't pay money for clothes.
6345760	6347760	I mean, what do you really use the avatars for?
6347760	6348760	Nothing.
6348760	6354760	On your card, your gamer card, maybe you see it in 1 versus 100. I mean, it's not that big a deal.
6354760	6358760	I guess there's some games, a few games that use them, but not really.
6358760	6360760	And who cares? No one's gonna go,
6360760	6363760	Oh my god, your avatar is poorly dressed.
6363760	6364760	Shame.
6364760	6367760	SSJ100Matt says, Rangers jersey, please.
6367760	6370760	That's actually kind of a good point. What about these sports jersey tie-ins?
6370760	6373760	That might be kind of cool, like to wear your favorite team,
6373760	6376760	just like a lot of people actually do wear that stuff, right?
6376760	6380760	Well, good for them, but I'm not buying it.
6380760	6385760	Steampunk clothing? I'm sorry, my character does not need a bust.
6385760	6388760	No bust for my character.
6388760	6389760	No bust for you.
6389760	6393760	Alright, moving on to some more news. Speaking of Xbox Live Arcade,
6393760	6399760	apparently there's some mumbling going around that indie games are being closed out of Xbox Live Arcade.
6399760	6404760	This came from a report from Screenplay talking to some concerned developers.
6404760	6409760	Apparently Microsoft has been dramatically reducing the number of independent titles published on Xbox Live Arcade.
6409760	6417760	I guess the whole crackdown on independent games is a response to folks saying that there is just too much available on the service.
6417760	6419760	The major publishers are actually behind this saying that,
6419760	6425760	Well, you aren't giving enough attention to our major games because you're spending time promoting these indie games.
6425760	6430760	Indie developers, also a little sad because they think there are two different sets of rules for publishers,
6430760	6433760	one being for indies and one being for major publishers.
6433760	6438760	Microsoft has responded to the accusations. It took them a little while, but they did respond and say,
6438760	6441760	Xbox Live is a great supporter of independent game development.
6441760	6444760	Xbox Live Arcade is home to some of the biggest games to come out of the IGF,
6444760	6446760	including N Plus, Braid, and Castle Crashers.
6446760	6451760	Our biggest annual program, Summer of Arcade, includes Splosion Man from the Twisted Pixel Studio,
6451760	6454760	and we're releasing Madballs and Babo Invasion this week.
6454760	6456760	In addition to our support of indie games on Xbox Live Arcade,
6456760	6462760	we've also drastically reduced the barriers for developers to distribute a game on Xbox 360 through the Xbox Live indie games,
6462760	6465760	and we've made development easier with XNA Game Studio.
6465760	6469760	The result is that more and more indie developers are distributing their games to the Xbox Live community.
6469760	6474760	There are currently hundreds of games available on the Xbox Live indie games, with more coming every week.
6474760	6479760	And honestly, I see the point where they're kind of being shut off, but at the same time,
6479760	6483760	if they market themselves right, they could actually release a game through community games,
6483760	6485760	and it could be the same quality.
6485760	6487760	I mean, there's some really good games on there.
6487760	6491760	The problem is there's a lot of really crappy games on there as well, and it kind of gets buried in all that.
6491760	6498760	As we mentioned, part A, now you can link to your downloads and stuff like that in your blogs.
6498760	6504760	I mean, there's a lot of ways they can market themselves, but I think they want Microsoft to kind of do the marketing for them,
6504760	6510760	and maybe they should if Microsoft's getting so much money from it,
6510760	6515760	but at the same time, it's not like they're completely being blocked out of it.
6515760	6519760	Just because it's not on Xbox Live Arcade doesn't mean it can't be up on their service.
6519760	6522760	You know, I do think Microsoft is a little bit in the right here.
6522760	6529760	Certainly they're doing more than Nintendo or Sony's doing, although it does seem Nintendo does get a lot of indie games on it.
6529760	6534760	I mean, yeah, they get a lot of indie games on it, but is Nintendo actually promoting those indie games?
6534760	6537760	It's really the indie games that are promoting themselves on there.
6537760	6540760	That's true. That's very true. How do you hear about any of those games? You don't.
6540760	6544760	Through the blog, Nintendo doesn't do a lot to sell those games, besides just put them on the marketplace.
6544760	6549760	Or, you know, send out the email, here's the stuff on the virtual console we wear. Big deal.
6549760	6553760	So I think to some extent Microsoft's in the right there, but at the same time,
6553760	6561760	what about, I thought there was supposed to be that the really big, great indie games would cross over into being full-blown Xbox Live Arcade games.
6561760	6565760	Whatever happened to that? Because you still can't get achievements out of indie games.
6565760	6567760	Some of them are. I mean, like, uh...
6567760	6569760	What? What's crossed over?
6569760	6576760	The, uh... Dishwasher. That one crossed over. There was, um...
6576760	6581760	Oh, there was another one that was, like, a winner that GameCon is saying. I can't remember.
6581760	6583760	I know there's a couple that have crossed over, but it's pretty cool.
6583760	6586760	Oh, the Aegis Wing? That was free? Was that one?
6586760	6587760	Uh, no, not that one.
6587760	6588760	That was before XNA.
6588760	6591760	Yeah, that was something else. There are some other ones that won.
6591760	6595760	But I know the community games, there's a few that actually get spotlighted.
6595760	6600760	Like, Carnivale Showtime or whatever. Remember that one I was talking about a long time ago?
6600760	6605760	That's actually being shown off at PAX now, and they're little indie games things, so...
6605760	6608760	I'm almost wondering if something like that's going to Xbox Live Arcade.
6608760	6612760	But I don't see at the same point why they should re-release them on Xbox Live Arcade.
6612760	6615760	They should be able to just, like, move them over, link them or something, or... I don't know.
6615760	6619760	Put achievements in them and maybe polish it a little more and then be done with it, right?
6619760	6620760	Yeah.
6620760	6625760	But I do think that's one thing. You know, I do feel like indie games are just kind of there.
6625760	6627760	I don't think they're promoted very well.
6627760	6629760	Yeah.
6629760	6634760	But, you know, they are doing, I think, more to promote them than other places.
6634760	6638760	I mean, I don't know if Sony is promoting them. Well, hell, they don't really have that many indie games.
6638760	6644760	I mean, they do have some indie games on their PlayStation Network servers, but it's not like you're getting a flood of games coming out from them.
6644760	6652760	It's like one or two a week, maybe, if you're getting a release every week. Whereas there's hundreds of community games.
6652760	6659760	Yeah. So, I don't know. I think Microsoft certainly does more for indies than most other folks do.
6659760	6662760	I don't think people should complain too much.
6662760	6667760	You know, I've heard this thing about, you know, there's only so many spaces that Xbox Live has to put these independent games in.
6667760	6670760	There's so many people developing for Xbox Live Arcade.
6670760	6675760	Well, maybe some of this should be developed as disc games or, you know, a step further.
6675760	6679760	But I guess, you know, at the same time, that's expensive. How indie is that?
6679760	6685760	Why not do collections? You know, the monthly pick or something.
6685760	6687760	Could be.
6687760	6692760	SJ100Matt brings us a story from, you know, a community developer we've had on this game a couple times before.
6692760	6696760	Aaron from Snake360 paid a lot of money and tried hard to promote his game.
6696760	6702760	But the fact of the matter is, many of the big sites, magazines, and everywhere else think all XNA games aren't good.
6702760	6705760	Yeah, that's unfortunate.
6705760	6708760	And I guess in the next scene, XLink says a vote system.
6708760	6711760	I guess that's what's coming in the next version of Xbox Live.
6711760	6717760	The dashboard, they've talked about that they're going to have voting on not only the community games, but the regular games too.
6717760	6722760	Which should be interesting. Although, I don't know, I think those voting systems can be abused.
6722760	6729760	You know, if it's like Dig, it can be abused. It's just who's the most popularist, right?
6729760	6731760	Yeah.
6731760	6736760	Fear of the Claw, though, says this, the point of being indie is to find mythical treasures.
6736760	6739760	The point of being indie is to get yourself out there.
6739760	6741760	You know, play on the word indie.
6741760	6744760	But I get what he's saying is that, you know, getting yourself out there is a big part of it.
6744760	6749760	So, to be continued, I'm sure. Anyhow, our show is to be continued, right, Darsarha?
6749760	6753760	Oh, absolutely. We do have a little bit more in the way of news.
6753760	6759760	Well, it's not really news. It's something that we all knew and have been saying and they finally admitted.
6759760	6767760	Ryota Nitsuma, who is the assistant producer on the arcade version of Street Fighter IV,
6767760	6773760	said that there are two fighters who were disproportionately powerful.
6773760	6779760	And he actually, to quote him, says, well, first of all, I might have to apologize.
6779760	6782760	Does he involve being slightly blinded and scarred?
6782760	6790760	And so, actually, he said that Seth and perhaps Sagat are two overpowered characters in the game,
6790760	6793760	but a skilled player can still beat them.
6793760	6796760	I wouldn't call them overpowered other than cheap.
6796760	6800760	Cheap, I think, goes with the overpowered thing.
6800760	6809760	It's more that they are, I would say, just for skill level, that it would require a higher amount of skill level
6809760	6812760	than it would to fight any of the other characters.
6812760	6817760	The final boss should be hard, but I agree, he's way too freaking hard.
6817760	6820760	Seth is a cheap-ass mofo. Yeah, he's way too hard.
6820760	6821760	Yeah.
6821760	6824760	I think also the boss in Tatsunoko vs Capcom.
6824760	6825760	God!
6825760	6826760	Oh my god, cheap.
6826760	6828760	The fucking Happy Fun Ball?
6828760	6829760	Yeah.
6829760	6830760	Ugh.
6830760	6833760	I agree with that.
6833760	6839760	End of the fight three times, which makes it three times as awesome or frustrating.
6839760	6840760	However, you want to look at that.
6840760	6842760	Interesting, though, that they've come out and admit it.
6842760	6845760	Like, a lot of times, people are like, no, my game is perfect. Nothing's wrong with it.
6845760	6847760	Yeah, we got fucked up.
6847760	6848760	Don't.
6848760	6851760	Well, fix it, then.
6851760	6853760	Put out a patch for the home versions.
6853760	6856760	I mean, you've got some of them online. Do it.
6856760	6860760	Ah, but that means you've got to do work. No.
6860760	6864760	We've already sold a jillion copies. Why should we bother?
6864760	6866760	Yes.
6866760	6874760	Well, I have to quote Dark Tetsuya saying that hopefully the Happy Fun Ball is toned down a bit for the US version.
6874760	6881760	And I do agree with SSU-100 Matt, Gil is still a big bitch.
6881760	6882760	Alright, let's move on.
6882760	6890760	Yes. So, kind of interesting, there's now a rumor, or not really a rumor, I guess it's an internal memo,
6890760	6897760	Canadian retailer Zellers has put out a memo, apparently, internally in their store chain,
6897760	6902760	that they're going to be no longer stocking the 80 gig PS3 core bundles.
6902760	6905760	That would be, of course, the system by itself.
6905760	6921760	It says basically that they are not to take rain checks on an advertising deal allowing customers to purchase an 80 gig core bundle with any PS3 game under $30 for $380 after a $20 discount.
6921760	6924760	And I'm assuming that's $380 Canadian.
6924760	6934760	And apparently, the memo also says that the rain checks can't be accepted because the company cannot promise to fill them with the same item.
6934760	6942760	So basically saying more or less that they're not going to be available and that they're phasing them out.
6942760	6949760	And basically a big neon sign that says the PS3 Slim is true, so shut up with these rumor stories.
6949760	6952760	In fact, I don't want any more stories about the PS3 Slim being a rumor.
6952760	6955760	It's confirmed. If this doesn't confirm it, I don't know what does.
6955760	6960760	It is true. It's happening.
6960760	6963760	Yes. It's happening. I know it's happening.
6963760	6968760	So I don't want to hear this nonsense about a rumored PS3 Slim. It's happening.
6968760	6971760	It's just a matter of Sony to reveal date and price. That's it.
6971760	6982760	Well, you do. I don't know if this is one of the stories, but for the games conference in, I think it's in Germany, wherever, Europe.
6982760	6983760	Leipzig?
6983760	6985760	Not anymore. I think it's somewhere else.
6985760	6986760	Oh yeah, that's right.
6986760	6994760	Anyways, games conference. Sony has booked three hours for talking their keynote or whatever that's going to be there.
6994760	6996760	Geez.
6996760	6998760	Could maybe this be something that they're talking about?
6998760	6999760	You think?
6999760	7001760	PS3 Slim?
7001760	7006760	Why not take it to a country that's received the PlayStation a little better than the US? This is why we didn't hear about it at E3.
7006760	7009760	They're waiting to announce it for Europe.
7009760	7011760	At the price point of $800.
7011760	7013760	Let's hope not.
7013760	7015760	They wouldn't get it.
7015760	7019760	That would be just... Oh god. I bet something stupid like that does happen.
7019760	7028760	Let me put it this way. The PS3 Slim is coming out like the sun rises every day, okay? It's without fail.
7028760	7036760	And if we've learned anything from Sony rumor stories, it's that most of the time they come true.
7036760	7038760	Especially if you hear them over and over and over.
7038760	7040760	It's true. I mean, if this isn't confirmation, what is?
7040760	7045760	Gee, we have to get rid of the 80GB bundles because we're not going to be getting any more in.
7045760	7048760	And we can't ever guarantee that we're going to be able to replace them because they're just not being made anymore.
7048760	7050760	I wonder why?
7050760	7052760	Didn't we say a couple weeks ago on this show?
7052760	7055760	Sony's going to start clearing stuff out when it's time to get a new bundle out there.
7055760	7057760	When is the Eurogame conference?
7057760	7059760	A few weeks, I think.
7059760	7061760	So there you go.
7061760	7063760	It's happening.
7063760	7065760	It just might not happen in the US first.
7065760	7067760	Something else to think about? Maybe it's happening in Europe first.
7067760	7069760	No, it will happen in the US.
7069760	7071760	We'll see.
7071760	7075760	Well, one thing that will be happening everywhere is PopCap announcing Bookworm Adventures 2.
7075760	7077760	That is coming out on July 30th.
7077760	7079760	I remember Bookworm Adventures.
7079760	7081760	Yeah, Bookworm Adventures is kind of neat.
7081760	7083760	It's kind of like a role-playing game meets Boggle.
7083760	7085760	I guess is the best way I can describe it.
7085760	7087760	You make these words out of a Boggle-style board.
7087760	7093760	And depending on how long you make the words and what kind of special gems and things you use in the words,
7093760	7095760	you attack monsters that approach you.
7095760	7097760	So it's a little bit role-playing-ish.
7097760	7099760	Although I wouldn't say there's a world map or anything like that.
7099760	7101760	Why hasn't this come to the DS yet?
7101760	7105760	I'm actually kind of surprised we haven't really seen this anywhere but the PC.
7105760	7107760	Nowhere. We haven't seen it on Xbox Live.
7107760	7109760	We haven't seen it on Facebook. We haven't seen it anywhere.
7109760	7111760	Kind of interesting.
7111760	7113760	But yeah, it's going to be released on July 30th.
7113760	7115760	$19.99 is how much it's going to set you back.
7115760	7117760	So there it is.
7117760	7119760	There's also a free trial available on PopCap.com.
7119760	7123760	And yeah, if you haven't played the original, it's fun.
7123760	7125760	And they haven't said exactly what's new about the sequel,
7125760	7130760	but I'm imagining more items, more monsters, more special things.
7130760	7132760	More of the same.
7132760	7134760	But new and improved at the same time.
7134760	7138760	So that's what's coming to Bookworm Adventures 2.
7138760	7140760	That could be fun.
7140760	7144760	Let's get our very own Bookworm Dark Sakura to jump into the mailbag and do some reading.
7144760	7145760	Do I gotta?
7145760	7149760	You gotta. It's our mailbag section we do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.
7149760	7156760	When you send your emails to mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com.
7156760	7161760	Well, the first email of the day is really short, and I really don't get it, but I'm going to read it anyway.
7161760	7163760	Sent to us by one.
7163760	7165760	It's hot here in California, right? 108 in L.A.
7165760	7167760	That's a spam. That's a spam.
7167760	7168760	It is?
7168760	7170760	Yeah. God damn that spam.
7170760	7173760	Well, I just figured because we were talking about the heat earlier and it was the last one to arrive.
7173760	7175760	It's convenient spam.
7175760	7178760	Yeah. Okay, well then whatever. Fuck you.
7178760	7184760	Well, maybe it wasn't spam. I'll feel bad if it is, but usually those very short emails and stuff.
7184760	7186760	Is there an attachment that's an HTML file?
7186760	7187760	I didn't notice.
7187760	7190760	It's probably spam if it is. Sorry to the listener if it's not.
7190760	7191760	Yeah, there was an attachment.
7191760	7197760	Here, if you want us to know that you're not spam, put OLR or Orange Lounge Radio or something in the title.
7197760	7198760	Then we'll know.
7198760	7200760	Please do.
7200760	7202760	This one comes from Deathwishing.
7202760	7208760	You guys talked about MechWarrior and I was wondering if you had heard of the BattleMech Firestorm. Tell us applause.
7208760	7209760	Yes, we have.
7209760	7214760	Basically, it's MechWarrior 4 put into a huge cabinet to simulate being in the mech. Simply badass.
7214760	7219760	They are rare, though, and mostly at conventions. You should buy one for the studio. We'll have a new room to put on.
7219760	7221760	Oh, yeah, okay. I got that money in my butt right here.
7221760	7226760	We had BattleMech at Dave and Buster's in Milpitas and they took it out.
7226760	7233760	Because we went for one of my last birthdays and we didn't have it there and Dan died inside.
7233760	7234760	It was sad.
7234760	7237760	I got very motion sick playing it and he kept shooting me.
7237760	7243760	Back in the day, I used to play lots of BattleTech at Virtual World, which is basically the same thing.
7243760	7247760	They had giant pods you would get into.
7247760	7251760	Well, also, the next email comes from...
7251760	7256760	Well, I just want to say, though, it's still not the same as the real mechs we were talking about last episode.
7256760	7258760	I want a real mech battle arena.
7258760	7260760	No, like Robot Jocks.
7260760	7264760	Found my screener for Robot Jocks on VHS.
7264760	7269760	Death Wishing in Chat says, why would they take it out? Well, because I guess it was expensive.
7269760	7271760	It was expensive and not enough people were playing it.
7271760	7273760	Yeah, it's expensive and takes up a lot of space.
7273760	7276760	Why play that when I can play skee-ball?
7276760	7282760	This one comes from... You didn't actually sign it, so I'm just going to say Tranman.
7282760	7285760	No, from Loomis, sorry.
7285760	7288760	Longtime listener, first time emailer.
7288760	7295760	Do y'all think we will see less third party games on PSP with the latest NPD results?
7295760	7301760	It seems to sell a decent amount of hardware monthly, but the software isn't anywhere near the top 10.
7301760	7307760	It's disappointing to see a game like Rock Band Unplugged sell only 35,000 units, considering the quality of it.
7307760	7311760	Thanks for taking my email, and I hope to have the courage to call in.
7311760	7313760	Also, Sky, please upload the podcast sooner.
7313760	7316760	Best wishes to Loki on the Twins and Hi Dark Sakura.
7316760	7318760	Hi!
7318760	7324760	I'll try. I'm really sorry about last week. I explained it earlier in the show, though.
7324760	7327760	As far as third party games on the PSP, yeah, they keep selling like crap.
7327760	7330760	I mean, again, what's being done to promote these games?
7330760	7332760	I don't see a whole lot of great buzz out there.
7332760	7339760	Although, to be fair, Rock Band Unplugged had probably better buzz than most games out there, so it is kind of sad the game itself didn't do better.
7339760	7346760	But the PSP has just not, I think, penetrated the greater marketplace as the must-have handheld system for gaming.
7346760	7349760	I think it's niche as college kids.
7349760	7351760	Last email.
7351760	7353760	Hey guys!
7353760	7358760	This is my first time writing in, and I am excited and nervous, so sorry if this comes out sounding weird.
7358760	7360760	You sound weird!
7360760	7365760	I just started listening to your podcast this year, and it has been one of the greatest things I've ever found on the internet.
7365760	7368760	Gushing aside, listening to you guys seriously brightens up my day.
7368760	7370760	That sounds like more gushing. Thank you.
7370760	7375760	I actually wanted to get your opinion on two topics, with the first being buying used games.
7375760	7383760	Rob, I know that you're a staunch proponent for buying games and hardware because it purports the industry and gets people to keep developing.
7383760	7391760	However, in my case, the money just doesn't exist for me to buy new games most of the time, so I buy mainly...
7391760	7392760	I think you missed a word.
7392760	7395760	So I buy mainly used and then new when I can.
7395760	7401760	So what kind of effect do you think used game buyers have on the industry since our money isn't going directly to the company?
7401760	7403760	I'll end it with that one for right now.
7403760	7408760	Oh, I don't think I'm against buying used games. I just don't really do it myself.
7408760	7412760	I don't really have a good reason why. I guess I just like kind of knowing where the game's been.
7412760	7418760	I will, though. I usually buy games either when they first come out or not at all, or when they get very, very cheap.
7418760	7424760	I don't know. I wouldn't say I'm against used game buying. I mean, it's just part of the nature of the entertainment business.
7424760	7431760	Same thing happens with DVDs. It hasn't killed the movie studios yet, so I'm not against it.
7431760	7436760	I look at buying used games as sort of ongoing advertising, especially if you're buying something in a series.
7436760	7445760	Because who knows? You pick up an earlier game, you might like it so much that you might justify the cost of the sequel when it comes out or something to that.
7445760	7453760	And on top of that, you're indirectly, I think, helping the industry because you're helping the economy.
7453760	7463760	By keeping cash in, cash out, by keeping the flow of business going, you're eventually putting more money in people's pockets to be able to go out and buy new games.
7463760	7466760	For lack of a better way to put it.
7466760	7471760	And with all the download content that's out there now in this day and age, I don't think these companies are going to be particularly bankrupt.
7471760	7476760	Why do you think companies do this pay-to-unlock crap in the first place?
7476760	7479760	Why do you think companies do this pay-to-unlock crap in the first place?
7479760	7483760	Because it's their way of still making a little bit of money even off of used games. Think about it.
7483760	7490760	Second question is this. What do you think about the concept of a semi-hardcore gamer?
7490760	7497760	Wait, I've got to read this for the chat. SSG100Matt says you don't buy used underwear, but they sell it at thrift stores.
7497760	7504760	People do buy used underwear. It's frightening that they also do sell used underwear and vending machines.
7504760	7511760	You know, myself, I also don't put my dick next to a video game. You know what I mean? Does that make sense?
7511760	7513760	My second question is this.
7513760	7516760	Somebody else might have, though, I guess. There's your reason not to buy a used game.
7516760	7517760	Rob.
7517760	7518760	What?
7518760	7519760	What do you think?
7519760	7520760	I've got balls on it.
7520760	7521760	Rob!
7521760	7530760	I'm going to do that. Before I take my games back to GameStop now, I'm going to give them one last goodbye by placing my balls on them.
7530760	7531760	Rob.
7531760	7532760	What?
7532760	7537760	I'm just saying.
7537760	7539760	Anyway.
7539760	7540760	Balls on game.
7540760	7546760	My second question is this. What do you think about the concept of a semi-hardcore gamer?
7546760	7553760	Do you feel they exist, and if so, why are they often overlooked in gaming discussion and marketing?
7553760	7558760	I would say I'm a semi-hardcore gamer. I don't really consider myself a hardcore gamer.
7558760	7561760	Take one look at my gamer score on Xbox Live. You'll see I'm not a hardcore gamer.
7561760	7566760	I think we actually fit into that category somewhere. We're more like educated gamers.
7566760	7568760	We enjoy, we're enthusiasts.
7568760	7571760	I like that word a whole lot. We're enthusiasts.
7571760	7582760	Yeah, but I don't think we're necessarily hardcore. I think a lot of us between our jobs, our significant others, our other hobbies, we don't have time to play a lot of video games.
7582760	7585760	But, you know, we play enough. We're somewhere in the middle there.
7585760	7588760	So yeah, absolutely semi-hardcore gamers exist.
7588760	7591760	And what was the second part of the question? Do they exist, and if so?
7591760	7603760	If so, why are they often overlooked in gaming discussion and marketing?
7603760	7609760	That's a good question. I think a lot of times we loop them into the hardcore category. I know I'm guilty of that on this show.
7609760	7615760	But I think you can't break things down, especially in media. You can't break things down into too many boxes.
7615760	7627760	You usually have to have black or white, A or B. You usually don't have discussions about the hardcore, the semi-hardcore, the kind of, I like games a lot, and the people who don't really play games at all.
7627760	7629760	I say we categorize.
7629760	7638760	Yeah, well, yeah, that's true too. And I think for a lot of people, especially the semi-hardcore gamers, if you will, they're more hardcore about certain types of games than others.
7638760	7641760	And that's another reason why I think we fit in this category.
7641760	7646760	A hardcore gamer, wouldn't a true hardcore gamer play all games no matter what?
7646760	7655760	I think that actually it has to go more towards hardcore into what you're really into. Like, I would say I'm definitely hardcore into Sims 3 right now.
7655760	7657760	You know, you were hardcore in World of Warcraft.
7657760	7658760	You're a hardcore nerd.
7658760	7659760	So?
7659760	7667760	But like, I wouldn't say I'm necessarily a hardcore gamer. I don't play Madden or sports games that come out. I'm so stupid in those types of games, you know?
7667760	7677760	I think it has to do with what you like best, you know? Like, for me, I play Sims all day. Then again, I also am not working and can't really do much with my hand.
7677760	7682760	But like I said, when you were playing World of Warcraft and you were playing Final Fantasy XI, weren't you fairly gung-ho?
7682760	7683760	Yeah, pretty much.
7683760	7690760	You know, it all has to do with what you're into. Like, there's people that live on Evercrack. Oh my god. That's...
7690760	7698760	All I do is play World of Warcraft. You know, you weren't that bad, but that's hardcore. There's people that live on the internet and end up like the kids in South Park at the end of that episode.
7698760	7700760	Mom! Bathroom.
7700760	7712760	But, I don't know. I think that it's not necessarily an overlooking. It's just, also you have to keep in mind that our society tends to work in extremes.
7712760	7713760	You either...
7713760	7715760	A or B.
7715760	7729760	The shades of grey would probably not be cost-effective to market to. So, they go for A or B and hope that, you know, A 2.0 is somewhere in the middle of it, you know?
7729760	7731760	All those little decimals in between.
7731760	7739760	Yeah, but I think that answers the question why people don't break down things further into the semi-hardcore, because it's got to be one extreme or the other.
7739760	7743760	Yeah. It was awesome to get a chance to talk to you guys. Later, MoltenBrown.
7743760	7745760	Well, thanks for emailing us, dude.
7745760	7748760	Try not to get some MoltenBrown on your DVDs before you give them back.
7748760	7751760	Oh, Josh. You're awful, Rob. Awful.
7751760	7754760	Call in, dude. We'd like to talk to you.
7754760	7767760	And by the way, I must say, this must be said, that was a very intelligently worded email, and I found no grammatical errors.
7767760	7770760	Email of the week. A winner is you. Congrats.
7770760	7777760	Alright. Fear of the Claw says, why are we still discussing testicular insertion instead of video games?
7777760	7782760	Actually, my last comment was referring to putting your butt on it.
7782760	7784760	You said putting your balls on it.
7784760	7785760	I did that, too.
7785760	7786760	Unless you wipe your balls with-
7786760	7789760	But MoltenBrown doesn't come from your balls.
7789760	7794760	Unless someone wipes your balls with their butt or something. That is really disgusting.
7794760	7799760	Oh, we're laughing because it's funny and we're immature.
7799760	7806760	Alright, moving on. I think we've disgusted a lot of our listeners tonight, and rightfully so.
7806760	7808760	I think the listeners are ready for the-
7808760	7809760	It's not my fault.
7809760	7813760	The listeners are ready for the FUs of the week. They are definitely ready for the FUs of the week.
7813760	7824760	Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is-
7824760	7826760	This is fucked up.
7826760	7829760	And once you know, tonight's inspiration comes from World of Warcraft.
7829760	7837760	That's right, it's an 18-year-old who lives in Greenwood, Indiana, currently being investigated by the FBI for making serious threats on World of Warcraft.
7837760	7846760	Apparently, on Monday, he said in-game that he was, quote, going to board a plane at 7.30 to Chicago, and that he was going to try and kill as many Americans as possible.
7846760	7853760	He left some other messages as well. Blizzard notified the authorities, believing the person was serious.
7853760	7861760	The person who's been charged with this claimed that their account was hacked, but then the kid later owned up, saying it was a joke.
7861760	7868760	Basically stemming from the belief that the cops would really go to your house if you make serious terrorist threats.
7868760	7875760	Oops! You were wrong on that one, weren't you, dumbass?
7875760	7877760	Let's get into the FUs of the week.
7877760	7885760	My FU goes to my hand for hurting like a motherfucker. Yes, like a motherfucker.
7885760	7887760	And the reason why it hurts is because I haven't-
7887760	7889760	With fucking mothers?
7889760	7894760	Because I had my physical therapy, and the exercises hurt quite a bit.
7894760	7901760	And also another FU to the suture that was left in my hand, and I understand why it was left in, but it's a pain in the ass.
7901760	7907760	A pain in the hand, really, I should say. A pain in my palm. I hate it.
7907760	7908760	Done.
7908760	7914760	That guy is a stupid, stupid. That's what he is. Sorry. Monkey.
7914760	7922760	FU to having to volunteer on Friday, because painting a fence in 100 degree weather is totally how I'd like to spend my Friday afternoon.
7922760	7926760	Just because I'm too lazy to tell them no.
7926760	7929760	And FU to the weather because it's too hot.
7929760	7936760	My FU of the week definitely goes to the weather. Fuck the sun. I am dying. Seriously, I just need to sleep or something.
7936760	7940760	I am feeling so sick right now. I'm gonna keel over and die or something.
7940760	7944760	Not really, but man, the heat sucks. And what's weird, I've been indoors most of the day.
7944760	7948760	I guess I was out in the car for a while driving around, but it wasn't that hot.
7948760	7951760	I've been drinking water. I think I'm gonna get more, though.
7951760	7956760	I'm gonna sneak out during the next story and get more water, because water rocks.
7956760	7960760	You want some more lemonade? I made a fresh thing of it.
7960760	7963760	Okay, yeah, I want more lemonade.
7963760	7966760	I love having a woman on the show who makes me food and drink.
7966760	7971760	First and foremost, you have a southern woman and you're in my home.
7971760	7975760	She is serving me drinks out of a mason jar, by the way, just so you know.
7975760	7981760	It is natural for me to want to make sure that you guys, as my guests, are taken care of.
7981760	7983760	And I appreciate it.
7983760	7987760	So, if you want to blame something, blame Alabama.
7987760	7991760	Well, thank you Alabama. Now get in the kitchen and get me some pie.
7991760	7999760	Hey, I'll give you pie. I'll give you a mud pie from the backyard.
7999760	8002760	Or maybe one of Shermie's cat pies.
8002760	8005760	I'll give you a pie. 3.14159.
8005760	8011760	Alright, moving on. Loki, help save our show from the completely immature path that's gone down.
8011760	8013760	Alright, let's see.
8013760	8019760	Well, I guess I could talk about this really unique game coming out called Miner Wars.
8019760	8023760	It's an MMO for the PC and Xbox Live Arcade.
8023760	8025760	You know, that's something you normally don't see.
8025760	8030760	It's apparently coming from a software house named Keen.
8030760	8039760	And I guess their new space shooter MMO, Miner Wars, they're planning on releasing it on Xbox Live Arcade as well as PC.
8039760	8049760	And it's, I guess, coming... it's supposedly coming out, I guess, autumn 2009. And that's kind of interesting.
8049760	8058760	So, I don't know. They're saying that the world premiere will be August 2009.
8058760	8062760	So, I wonder if that's coming out or if that's the first time we're going to see it. Who knows.
8062760	8067760	But the fact that they're putting an MMO on Xbox Live Arcade would be interesting. I wonder how they're going to do that.
8067760	8073760	Interesting. And the two are supposed to talk to each other? Is that what I'm understanding right?
8073760	8080760	That the two games would actually talk to each other through PC people could play on and so forth?
8080760	8087760	It's something that they'd like to do. And there were probably some compromises, but they're going to try to incorporate it.
8087760	8091760	Hmm. Interesting.
8091760	8093760	Yeah, that is pretty cool.
8093760	8100760	I mean, I guess the concept's cool, though, but doesn't... I mean, like, what if the game itself sucks, though?
8100760	8103760	I mean, it's kind of one of these, like, I'm reminded of the game I played this week, BitBoy.
8103760	8109760	It sounded great in writing, and the whole idea of an MMO that's on Xbox Live Arcade and PC is great in writing.
8109760	8113760	But if the game itself kind of blows, then what can you do?
8113760	8117760	I don't know. Not much, I guess. But I guess we'll have to find out. Maybe try the demo.
8117760	8122760	I guess that's true. I guess that means there will be a demo. So at least there's that, if nothing else.
8122760	8130760	All right, well, we've got one more story for you guys before we open up the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8130760	8138760	And that story is about a game franchise I'm sure you're excited to see. Murder, She Wrote is getting a franchise.
8138760	8139760	Really?
8139760	8144760	It's Murder, She Wrote the game. And, Loki, I know you're saying before the show that didn't they already have these games?
8144760	8147760	I think you might be getting mixed up with Agatha Christie or the, um...
8147760	8150760	I thought I'd know it. Literally, I thought they had at least one Murder, She Wrote game.
8150760	8154760	Well, there's that, and there's, what's the other one? The, um, Nancy Drew games.
8154760	8156760	Are they getting Angela Lansbury to do The Voice?
8156760	8157760	Wouldn't that be awesome?
8157760	8160760	That would be fan- I love Angela Lansbury.
8160760	8166760	That's right. You know what'd be great? Is a Murder, She Wrote, but, like, X-rated.
8166760	8170760	You know you want to see topless Angela Lansbury, come on.
8170760	8176760	Just kidding. Um, let's see. What else is happening in this game here?
8176760	8184760	It's about the Summer Garden Festival that you- what is- the hell is this game?
8184760	8188760	Today is the Summer Gardens Festival Gardens Competition and Tour.
8188760	8190760	An event I look forward to all year.
8190760	8194760	My tour group arrived at Matthew O'Neill's house in approximately 24- 1245 PM.
8194760	8197760	Only to discover Matthew lying dead in his garden. Da da da da da.
8197760	8201760	So basically you're going to explore a garden and try to find out who killed this person.
8201760	8202760	There you go. Doesn't that sound exciting?
8202760	8206760	I want to see hardcore Murder, She Wrote, though. I was just joking about the topless thing.
8206760	8211760	I wanted you guys to all barf in your mouth, but, like, I want to see, like, First Person Shooter with Angela Lansbury.
8211760	8212760	Wouldn't that be hardcore?
8212760	8216760	Murder, I Wrote. That's what it would be called.
8216760	8219760	Frisbee says Banger, She Wrote.
8223760	8230760	If you want to call in and talk about Murder, She Wrote or any game, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8230760	8233760	For now, I'll open it up in studio to some last minute stories.
8233760	8236760	Resident Evil 4 will be coming to the iPhone in July.
8236760	8243760	This is realized after it's shortly leaked out and was pulled, but Capcom has confirmed they'll be.
8243760	8245760	Hold on, we have a call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8245760	8248760	Hello?
8248760	8250760	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8250760	8252760	Oh, this is Juan Gonzalez.
8252760	8256760	So wait, are you the guy that emailed us earlier and I said, no, it's spam?
8256760	8258760	Yeah.
8258760	8263760	I take back my declaration of F-U. Sorry.
8263760	8276760	Do you know how many emails we get from guys named Juan that say something about like completely off the topic and nonsensical that turn out to be spam?
8276760	8278760	Hello?
8278760	8286760	I don't know if you can hear me right now, but I accidentally pressed the email to everyone while you're mailing all my emails.
8286760	8292760	So you are a real person and you're not trying to sell us Viagra?
8292760	8295760	Yeah. I'm a real person. A real gamer.
8295760	8298760	Well, okay. What did you want to say? Since we so rudely...
8298760	8301760	And by the way, you're echoing really bad, so you might want to get away from the radio.
8301760	8308760	Since we so rudely dismissed your email, I will give you some time now to say whatever you wanted to say or ask whatever you wanted to ask on the show.
8308760	8313760	I don't know. Sorry.
8313760	8317760	Hello? I think he's breaking up.
8317760	8319760	Connection.
8319760	8329760	Okay. If you have a question, go ahead and ask. We're having a hard time hearing you. Try to get your question out there so we can answer it.
8329760	8332760	Ah, fail. Sorry, Juan.
8332760	8338760	But we take back what we said about you being a spammer. That's so funny.
8338760	8347760	Alright. Sorry the connection was bad, Juan. But remember, guys, if you're going to call in on Skype, you can always call ECHO123 to call and test your call first. That's always a good way to do it.
8347760	8350760	Hi. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8350760	8352760	Hi. This is Spazinator.
8352760	8354760	Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind?
8354760	8378760	Um, you know, three really quick tips. Well, I figured whether it was at the very end of Bobby's show or at the beginning of your show proper, but regardless, you guys were talking about the Nyanko Museum with stencils that had just come out?
8378760	8385760	Yes. And just to restate in case we have people listening to our show that aren't listening to Bobby's show, which shame on you. Everybody should listen to Bobby.
8385760	8397760	But at the little toss we did at the end of Bobby's show, we had brought up the whole PlayStation 3 Nyanko Essentials had come out and I had wanted to check it out. I'm guessing maybe you got a chance too?
8397760	8425760	Yes. In fact, I had just bought it, literally bought it until the day it came out. And in my opinion, well, I know my opinion holds any weight, but basically, for the most part, the games are basically the same as any other version that you may have gotten over the years, whether it be for the PlayStation 2 or what have you.
8425760	8450760	Where the real draw is, is in the menu system they give you a card for each of the six games, and you get stamped for in-game achievements, like an Eli Apple-oriented Pac-Man or whatever.
8450760	8455760	So not trophies, but kind of like a localized in-game achievement type of thing?
8455760	8456760	Yes.
8456760	8470760	How many games do you get for your $10? Don't you get, like, I mean that's one thing I noticed right off the bat is that on Xbox Live you have to pay like $5 for the port of Pac-Man, but it seems like on this little Nyanko collection you're getting, like what, six games for $10?
8470760	8492760	Yeah, six games for $10, but what I was going to say is, where the draw is, is that with those cards, if you get so many stamps per card, like let's say three stamps on a card, then you get a trophy.
8492760	8513760	You get another three more, you get certain prizes that go with the foam, like t-shirts or other items, and so on and so forth, plus you get the online leaderboards and all that, so that's probably where the main draw is.
8513760	8523760	Well is it cool though, because in theory that concept sounds really cool to me, so you picked it up, I mean, have you unlocked anything at home, is it cool, does it kind of work the way you think it would?
8523760	8549760	Yeah, I've got like two t-shirts out of it so far, and plus I actually, while I was at home, I actually launched each of the games from inside of home, I walked up to each of the replicas of the arcade machines that played the games, and they seemed pretty good.
8549760	8578760	So that's kind of a neat little plus there, and plus, technically it's not part of the game itself, it's kind of like an interlayer within the bed area of home, there's other little stuff in there that you can unlock by playing the arcade stuff in there,
8578760	8587760	like you can get collectors items, a version of solar cans and stuff like that.
8587760	8602760	Well you know it sounds like I'm definitely going to have to download the game this week and check it out, and probably bring you guys a review later on, because I like the classic games, and I like having achievements, and I like being able to unlock stuff in home, I'm very curious to see how this works out.
8602760	8611760	Maybe I'll finally have motivation to open up the Orange Lounge Club in home too, we'll see. By the way, we got to hang up to get some more calls, but do you have anything else in your mind real quick?
8611760	8636760	Yeah, one last thing, I know you guys liked anime a lot, I just checked out a new movie called Robotech the Shadow Chronicles, it's a $8 movie that you can get from PSN, and it's pretty good, if you like cheap anime movies you may want to check that out.
8636760	8646760	Alright, so there you go, anime recommendation. I'm not a huge anime fan, but I'm definitely looking forward to Ponyo, because I do like Miyazaki films, so I'm going to check that out when it comes out in theaters.
8646760	8648760	I will go with you Rob.
8648760	8651760	Yay, good, because the boyfriend won't, because he says anime is not good.
8651760	8654760	Well, poo!
8654760	8659760	Although he's not really dumb, he's amazing, but anyway. Alright, take care Spazinator.
8659760	8661760	Alright, have a good one.
8661760	8662760	Later.
8662760	8672760	But seriously, I'm like, you love Disney, I'm like, Disney's putting this movie out. He says, but it's different, it's not the same, and I'm like, ah! Ah! I can't take it.
8672760	8676760	Alright, how are you on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?
8676760	8678760	Oh, oh my god, hold on.
8678760	8680760	Okay, sure, I'll hold.
8680760	8681760	Alright, it's Deathwishing.
8681760	8683760	Oh, hi Deathwishing, what's on your mind?
8683760	8687760	He keeps tagging, and then that popped up, and it kind of clusterfucked me.
8687760	8689760	Uh huh, what's up?
8689760	8691760	Um, giant robots.
8691760	8692760	Uh huh.
8692760	8695760	Lots of them. I'm really itching to play a giant robot game.
8695760	8697760	Sounds like an awesome game!
8697760	8699760	Tell me more.
8699760	8703760	Well, no, I mean, chrome hounds. I want to play chrome hounds and stuff, but...
8703760	8705760	Oh, there's too much stuff going on right now.
8705760	8712760	Well, we got Marvel vs. Capcom being re-released, and...
8712760	8716760	Awesome superhero hadouken fest.
8716760	8723760	I know, there's so many games to play in so little time. I had no idea people were still playing chrome hounds, though.
8723760	8732760	Well, I think, I see my friend playing it from Britain all the time, so I think, you know, fans are devoted to their games, like, look at Counter Strike.
8732760	8735760	That's true, I still see people playing Phantasy Star Universe, and I was like, wow.
8735760	8741760	I have been looking at my lonely copy of Earth Defense Force 2017, thinking about going back to finish it.
8741760	8744760	Did they announce a sequel for that finally, or did that ever happen?
8744760	8745760	No, I wish they did.
8745760	8747760	No, I'm sorry to hear that.
8747760	8757760	And, another thing is, are you gonna get those night vision goggles of Modern Warfare 2, so you can, like, spy around your set when it's dark?
8757760	8759760	No, this, oh my god.
8759760	8761760	I might not want to see what goes on when it's dark.
8761760	8763760	They're not worth the price, seriously, it's just...
8763760	8765760	Come on, they do something!
8765760	8768760	It's just a webcam with the IR filter ripped off of it.
8768760	8770760	Yeah, you're probably right.
8770760	8775760	I mean, if I wanted night vision goggles, which, I don't even know what the hell I'd use night vision goggles for.
8775760	8778760	I guess the question is, what would you use them for?
8778760	8780760	Exactly.
8780760	8786760	No, um, I was just, I mean, I was just curious, I mean, when I saw, I heard night vision goggles, I'm like, wow.
8786760	8789760	Like, before they announced the price, I'm like, holy crap, this must be a fortune.
8789760	8793760	I went to go look at prices for, like, the ones that look exactly like those, and it was like, $3,000.
8793760	8797760	I was like, holy crap, these are gonna be like, when did you go to Toys R Us to buy?
8797760	8801760	It's just because Activision needs yet another game over $100.
8801760	8805760	That's, there's like, how many games can we put out of there at $120 plus?
8805760	8807760	It's gonna be a good game. I know it's gonna be a good game.
8807760	8810760	It's made by Infinity Ward, they make the best, the good shooters.
8810760	8812760	I'm a shooter guy, so, but...
8812760	8815760	Yeah, I don't doubt it'll be a good game, but I think Activision makes more decisions.
8815760	8823760	That's like milk, that's just literally whipping it out, fapping as hard as you can, that's it.
8823760	8831760	That's a great game review right there.
8831760	8836760	I think some of these pack-ins are a little silly, but, you know, I guess Night Vision Goggles is certainly...
8836760	8838760	Are you guys going to Comic-Con?
8838760	8841760	No, there's too many conventions that go on this time of year.
8841760	8843760	We went to E3, and then I'm still trying to get to PAX.
8843760	8848760	Which reminds me, actually, we need to look into SAC Anime next month.
8848760	8849760	Oh, really?
8849760	8850760	Yeah.
8850760	8851760	I think it's the same weekend as PAX, isn't it?
8851760	8855760	It's coming down to Southern California.
8855760	8860760	As much as I would love to go to Comic-Con, I think it's this coming weekend, isn't it?
8860760	8861760	It's this week.
8861760	8864760	Yeah, you know what, I can't go, I have tickets to a concert.
8864760	8866760	What concert?
8866760	8868760	Like I tell you, I'm going to see No Doubt.
8868760	8870760	Oh, it's by Etterwips.
8870760	8875760	Yes, but I don't know, in all seriousness, there's so many conventions that go on this time of year,
8875760	8878760	and Comic-Con isn't enough gaming for me.
8878760	8879760	This issue sucks.
8879760	8882760	I probably will go one of these years, probably next year.
8882760	8884760	Well, this year sucks for anything gaming related.
8884760	8885760	Why is that?
8885760	8890760	Well, just look at November.
8890760	8895760	Look at it, it's this crap load of releases, and because of it, Bioshock 2 got delayed.
8895760	8898760	I guess that's true.
8898760	8902760	But Bioshock 2 is never coming out in November, it's coming out in October.
8902760	8903760	What?
8903760	8905760	That's what it was coming out.
8905760	8906760	Yeah, and then...
8906760	8907760	They delayed it this weekend in here.
8907760	8910760	No, I know they delayed it, but it was never coming out in November, it was coming out in October.
8910760	8912760	Oh, interesting.
8912760	8916760	Well, I'm just saying November is usually when everyone starts shipping out all their games,
8916760	8918760	and it's just like...
8918760	8920760	Stop it.
8920760	8922760	My wallet is...
8922760	8924760	My pants are burning.
8924760	8928760	DJ Tyrant and Chat pointed out that tickets to Comic-Con are sold out anyway, so that's hard.
8928760	8929760	They are.
8929760	8932760	Sneak in, just break a window or some stuff.
8932760	8934760	Alright, Deathwish, anything else on your mind before we let you go?
8934760	8935760	We gotta get more calls.
8935760	8936760	Giant robots.
8936760	8937760	Awesome.
8937760	8938760	Alright, take care.
8938760	8939760	Bye.
8939760	8940760	Bye.
8940760	8943760	Giant robots on fire.
8943760	8944760	That would be even better.
8944760	8946760	How about giant robots on fire?
8946760	8951760	That's not good, because then that ruins a perfectly good giant robot.
8951760	8952760	But it's on fire.
8952760	8953760	Hi, you're on Orange Launch.
8953760	8955760	No, it has to be a giant robot that shoots fire.
8955760	8956760	That's cool.
8956760	8957760	Can I take the call, please?
8957760	8958760	No, you can't.
8958760	8959760	We have to discuss the giant robot shooting fire.
8959760	8961760	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8961760	8962760	Who's this?
8962760	8963760	It's Misty.
8963760	8966760	Hi, Misty, we gotta let you go, because we gotta talk about robots shooting fire.
8966760	8968760	What the hell with that?
8968760	8970760	What's on your mind, Misty?
8970760	8971760	Not much, really.
8971760	8976760	I just kind of had an announcement I wanted to finally make after trying for practically
8976760	8977760	a month.
8977760	8979760	Okay, what is your big announcement?
8979760	8984760	That I am finally coming to SAC on at the end of August.
8984760	8987760	Holy poop balls, you're actually coming to Sacramento.
8987760	8988760	I knew about it.
8988760	8992760	I knew too, but she wanted to wait and tell us all on the show, even though we all knew.
8992760	8995760	Yeah, usually if you're coming to somebody's neck of the woods, though, you kind of give
8995760	8996760	them a little warning first.
8996760	8999760	I was a little freaked out at first, because I was like, oh crap, is it the same weekend
8999760	9000760	I'm going to be in Reno?
9000760	9003760	And it's like just before that Misty's going to be here.
9003760	9005760	I know, right outside.
9005760	9006760	I'm outside your door.
9006760	9008760	Knock, knock, knock.
9008760	9012760	So what kind of fun stuff are you going to do when you're in SAC?
9012760	9015760	I don't really have any particular plans.
9015760	9019760	I was thinking of going to our vehicle for the hell of it at least one or two days.
9019760	9020760	Yep, you gotta do that.
9020760	9021760	Oh, yeah.
9021760	9022760	You gotta see some of the sights.
9022760	9024760	See some of the OLR historical spots.
9024760	9025760	You gotta go to our vehicle.
9025760	9028760	Eat at the Brookfield's we used to always eat at at the parking lot.
9028760	9031760	Oh my God, wouldn't it be cool to have like an old school night while she's here?
9031760	9033760	Actually, we can make that happen.
9033760	9034760	Let's do that.
9034760	9035760	On a Wednesday.
9035760	9036760	On a Wednesday.
9036760	9037760	I was hoping so.
9037760	9038760	I kept hearing about that.
9038760	9041760	We'll have to make that happen somehow.
9041760	9044760	Unfortunately, you're not going to be here on a Sunday, though, right?
9044760	9047760	Yeah, because I'm so damn opposed to flying.
9047760	9048760	That's all right.
9048760	9050760	But hey, we'll figure something out.
9050760	9052760	We'll do a taped bit or something.
9052760	9054760	We can do OLR on location at our vehicle.
9054760	9055760	Oh my God.
9055760	9056760	Like the old place.
9056760	9060760	And remember we used to do it when we had the bit that we did over the old Beatmania?
9060760	9061760	Mm-hmm.
9061760	9062760	Of the hip-hop mania.
9062760	9063760	Yeah.
9063760	9064760	That was fun.
9064760	9068760	I remember getting threatened to throw out of there by kids younger than I am.
9068760	9071760	But hey, that's the way it goes sometimes.
9071760	9072760	So other things.
9072760	9075760	What else would be on the OLR Sacramento Historical Tour?
9075760	9078760	You could go to the Target where we camped out for a wee where Jamie got recognized from
9078760	9079760	the show.
9079760	9080760	That was fun.
9080760	9081760	That was fun.
9081760	9082760	That's over on Sunrise.
9082760	9083760	And then what else?
9083760	9087760	What other OLR historical stops are there?
9087760	9089760	We could try to make the trip to Stockton.
9089760	9090760	Oh, blech.
9090760	9091760	No.
9091760	9092760	Blech.
9092760	9093760	No, that's not what we're doing.
9093760	9094760	You should show Missy the good stuff while you're here.
9094760	9095760	We could...
9095760	9101760	We need to see some of the crap to counterbalance and to see why the other good stuff is so
9101760	9102760	good.
9102760	9103760	That's true.
9103760	9104760	You could go to Scandia, home of Shaft.
9104760	9112760	We'll actually have to play the putt putt there.
9112760	9115760	And ride the screamer, but you can't scream on it.
9115760	9116760	Yeah.
9116760	9117760	What the hell?
9117760	9118760	I know.
9118760	9120760	All this will be explained all in due time.
9120760	9124760	Well, hey, let us know again as things are getting a little closer and you got your itinerary
9124760	9129760	all planned out and we'll definitely meet up with you during the week and figure something
9129760	9130760	out.
9130760	9137760	That twit pic I posted is my incoming itinerary with all the Greyhound stops and crap.
9137760	9138760	Nice.
9138760	9139760	All right.
9139760	9141760	Well, we are looking forward to...
9141760	9145760	I've met you in person, but I know the other two haven't, so we're looking forward to having
9145760	9146760	you here.
9146760	9151760	I know you've been a long time listener, so this is the ultimate in fan trips to take.
9151760	9152760	Indeed.
9152760	9153760	All right.
9153760	9156760	Well, we're going to let you go, Missy, so we can get some more calls, but we will see
9156760	9157760	you soon.
9157760	9158760	And I mean that.
9158760	9159760	See you soon.
9159760	9160760	All righty.
9160760	9161760	All right.
9161760	9162760	I'm excited.
9162760	9163760	Later.
9163760	9164760	Later.
9164760	9165760	I can't believe she's taking a bus, though.
9165760	9166760	Oh, my gosh.
9166760	9167760	That is such a long bus ride.
9167760	9168760	Take a train.
9168760	9170760	Well, a train's going to be just as bad.
9170760	9172760	Probably a little more expensive, too.
9172760	9173760	Yeah, a train's better.
9173760	9174760	But I understand.
9174760	9177760	If you're seriously scared death of planes, I could understand.
9177760	9179760	It's going to be tough.
9179760	9180760	All right.
9180760	9181760	Let's wrap it up.
9181760	9182760	We're going to close the Skype line.
9182760	9183760	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
9183760	9185760	Let's wrap it up with some last minute stories.
9185760	9188760	I know you probably have a couple we didn't get to, Loki.
9188760	9191760	I'm sure I do.
9191760	9195760	So, continuing on with the iPhone discussion.
9195760	9199760	There's a fan-made Portal game coming to the iPhone.
9199760	9203760	Companion Cube is the name of the program, and it's basically Portal on the iPhone.
9203760	9204760	Yay!
9204760	9205760	Who doesn't want that?
9205760	9209760	So, that's kind of neat.
9209760	9216760	Apparently, there was an artist that worked for Google that was hiding Triforces on a
9216760	9222760	bunch of their little Google splashes that they do for different events, different holidays,
9222760	9223760	and whatnot.
9223760	9229760	Fortunately, because of all this buzz about said Triforces, they have now been all removed.
9229760	9234760	So, that was fun while it lasted, I guess.
9234760	9235760	There is a rumor-
9235760	9237760	And the artist responsible has been sacked.
9237760	9241760	I don't know if that's the case, but maybe.
9241760	9247760	There is a game coming to North America, Rumored, at least.
9247760	9252760	Rizzoad, and that's actually a game based off the Wizard of Oz.
9252760	9255760	Kind of think of Kingdom Hearts meets Wizard of Oz.
9255760	9258760	And, for the DS, it's rumored to be coming out over here.
9258760	9260760	Actually, I can tell you it's coming out over here.
9260760	9262760	Exceeds bringing it over.
9262760	9264760	It'll be coming out this fall, actually.
9264760	9267760	September or October, I can't remember.
9267760	9273760	But anyways, so that's kind of neat, a new RPG series maybe we can check out.
9273760	9279760	And, Brutal Legends is going to be getting 4 on 4 skirmish multiplayer matches.
9279760	9281760	Hot 4 on 4 action.
9281760	9282760	Yes, exactly.
9282760	9284760	So, that's pretty cool.
9284760	9290760	I mean, hey, the game looks awesome by itself, but multiplayer, that just adds to the fun.
9290760	9295760	I think we talked about this before, but apparently a fan is putting together a game based off
9295760	9302760	of the Free Space Open, which I think is an open source free space engine.
9302760	9308760	And, basically, it's Shadows of Liet, which is a Star Fox type of game.
9308760	9314760	And, this is currently in development right now, but luckily, I'm guessing at the rate it's going
9314760	9318760	and the amount of coverage it's getting right now, that probably will never happen.
9318760	9322760	It'll probably get a cease and desist, which is too bad.
9322760	9327760	And then, of course, you know, people have been editing the PC version of Street Fighter 4
9327760	9332760	that has been recently released, doing all sorts of things, such as making Cami nude,
9332760	9338760	which looks retarded, and swapping people's, their move sets.
9338760	9341760	I was watching Dan with Dalsim's moves, that's funny.
9341760	9342760	Which looks pretty funny.
9342760	9347760	And, I don't know, that's about as bad as when they were doing that with Smash Brothers.
9347760	9353760	And then, a game I'd like to talk about real quick, that they had a clip of it online, looks fucking sweet.
9353760	9357760	It's the Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, is the name of the game.
9357760	9360760	And, it kind of has a similar art style to Potapon.
9360760	9366760	But, it's this game where you fly around a little UFO, and it's kind of a shooter, puzzle, platformer game.
9366760	9368760	And, it looks absolutely crazy.
9368760	9371760	So, definitely check out the video if you haven't yet.
9371760	9376760	It's got an awesome little kind of soundtrack to go with it.
9376760	9381760	I think the actual website is the incredible, what was it?
9381760	9386760	InsanelyTwistedShadowPlanet.com, I think this is actually the website.
9386760	9390760	But, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, yeah.
9390760	9395760	But, the guy actually that's responsible for it, he actually is an animator, and he's done a bunch of really cool stuff.
9395760	9398760	So, definitely worth checking out.
9398760	9404760	And then, another game that's supposed to be coming out that looks pretty cool on XNA is Vex and Silence.
9404760	9410760	It's a kind of a stylized first person shooter game, and actually looks pretty polished for an XNA game.
9410760	9413760	But, you can check out more information on that.
9413760	9418760	It's going to span, I guess, 13 levels, and have a side scrolling shooter as well.
9418760	9422760	Oh, it is a side scrolling shooter. It looks like a first person shooter from what I saw.
9422760	9428760	But anyways, VexandSilence.com, and that's V-E-K-S.
9428760	9430760	So, check that out.
9430760	9433760	And, that's it.
9433760	9438760	Alright, well, that's going to wrap it up for our show tonight, but we can't end until we go around and get everybody's final thought.
9438760	9441760	So, DarkSagra, your final thought for us tonight?
9441760	9445760	They have finally put out custom hair for Sims 3. I think that's fantastic.
9445760	9448760	Hurray! Loki, your final thought?
9448760	9452760	My final thought is, I had something to share, but I don't have it anymore, so.
9452760	9453760	How useful.
9453760	9456760	I didn't set myself right.
9456760	9461760	Alright, and my final thought is, oh my god, I'm seriously going to pass out from the heat.
9461760	9463760	Damn you, son.
9463760	9464760	Go away.
9464760	9467760	Actually, it is away now. It's finally set, but don't come up again tomorrow.
