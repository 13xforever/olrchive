13936	19946	Tonight, July 19th, 2009, Dragon Quest IX might get DLC as it sells oodles of copies.
20286	23432	Could your mall soon get a Microsoft Store next to the Apple Store?
23812	27198	And Capcom finally admits something we've always known about Street Fighter IV.
31929	35892	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35952	42216	We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42657	49982	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week are the awesome co-hosts that help make up OLR with me, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50526	52207	Greetings and salutations.
52367	52908	How are you, Ms.
52928	53248	Summers?
53708	54269	In pain.
54509	55590	Lots of it.
55810	56670	Me too this week.
56870	58972	I know you've got your hand thing going on, but oh my god.
58992	60073	But Vicodin makes it better.
60373	61353	Vicodin does make it better.
61674	63115	I wish Vicodin made heat stroke better.
63255	69959	Vicodin, however, means I cannot drink the delicious bottle of wine that's sitting on my counter in the kitchen.
70200	71060	But I can!
71821	73322	No, it'll make my heat thing worse.
74082	75183	I'll explain that in a minute.
75203	76624	Well, you're welcome to as much lemonade as you like.
76804	78205	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
98483	107110	Crap, I was too lazy to say no, so I had to go volunteer at this place called the Grace Foundation.
107150	110193	They rescue horses and stuff, and I had to go stay in a fence.
111013	111614	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
111894	114036	You volunteered for horses this week?
114156	119320	No, what it is is I forgot to say no to volunteering, you know, painting fences.
120626	120927	DarkSakura.com
129502	129902	You know what?
129942	132605	I have some aloe vera at home that's awesome because it's from Canada.
133245	137509	And they have different drugs up there that you can get at the drugstore you can't get here because Canadians rock.
138089	138610	Love you, Canada.
139210	144395	But they have this aloe vera gel that comes with lidocaine in it, which is the same stuff that dentists will use to numb your teeth.
144675	144975	Cool.
145896	147498	It's like prescription strength over here.
147518	149159	You can also get it with bentocaine, though.
149219	149579	It's true.
149779	150860	It's my arm thread.
150960	151341	That's it.
151581	151861	All right.
152882	154003	DarkSakura.com
169949	170870	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
195248	196930	So the box is getting sterilized.
196970	204235	It's sitting outside with that green spray on it in the front yard on the porch.
204635	208978	And I got on my hands and knees and scrubbed out the bottom of the closet.
209779	212100	And Shermie's bathroom is freaking clean.
212601	213882	Well, congrats.
214402	218525	But I've had to go out and spray down her big old litter box today.
219578	225323	To answer some questions from chat, and of course we always have the fourth guest on our show, the chatroom, chat.orangellandradio.com.
226043	228705	Fear of the Claws starts off with, what's the Vicodin for?
228765	229506	Why is Jamie on it?
229566	230706	I missed a couple episodes.
231407	232508	She had hand surgery, right?
232708	237091	Yeah, I had trigger finger release surgery.
237151	239013	So if you want to, I'm not going to explain it again.
239033	243556	If you guys want to know what it is, it's online on many, many websites.
243696	245477	And I think she explained it a couple episodes back.
245758	247619	I'll put something in the chatroom.
247899	251000	The podcast is lagging an episode behind, which is totally my fault.
251041	255282	Like a dummy, I ran out of here last week and left the USB drive in the computer.
255663	260105	And I never had a chance to get back home or come back over here and grab the USB drive.
260125	261845	Because Jamie lives a good 30 minutes from me.
262526	264107	Get the USB stick and upload the show.
264167	267448	So hopefully the last week's show will finally hit the podcast feed tonight.
267468	268168	And I apologize.
268208	270129	I know people miss it when we don't get the show up on time.
270189	271750	But I wasn't home.
271910	275512	I have not slept in my own bed since Wednesday night.
276072	277894	I'm also about to post the link for what trigger finger release surgery is.
296001	297462	There you go, if you want to educate yourself.
298142	299944	All right, well, let's get into our gaming weeks.
299964	300904	Well, I found a video of it.
301665	303126	Ew, don't... See, here's the thing.
303346	305347	I do not do well with blood squeamishness.
306488	307449	You know what's actually really funny?
308109	314553	Like, I don't mind Mortal Kombat type of games or Trauma Center or all the fake cartoon blood.
314994	321218	I have a very good mind that can distinguish, you know, as I'm sure a lot of you do, that can distinguish fake blood from real blood.
321578	322539	Even horror movies.
322719	323840	Even though I've gone into a...
324600	325621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
343996	344917	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
363993	366674	Well, thank you, but still, I just wanted to barf.
366894	369014	You remember when that exhibit was coming through town?
369034	370195	I wanted to go to that!
370255	373716	The bodies revealed that they were advertising on the radio for like six months.
374016	378837	There's just basically all these corpses that they've opened up so you can see everything.
378857	390520	No, it's actually really cool because what they've done, they've actually set them in everyday poses like in office positions or in play positions so that you can see the way that the muscles... But they're people!
390540	391421	They donated themselves.
391521	391801	However...
393241	396262	I don't think that they knew that hair could be donated for an exhibit.
396402	397042	I know.
397642	398423	I can't deal with it.
398443	400323	They're donated for scientific research.
400423	413327	And I think, well, as a massage therapist, I wanted to see it because for... Now, I'll tell you what the biggest thing that got me over my gross factor with bodies is watching cadaver videos.
415015	422038	and once you see muscles moving on their own, it's sort of... I'm going to barf.
422138	422739	I'm sorry.
423099	424900	Just not the type of stuff I'm into.
424980	425900	Yay, kittens.
425940	426600	I love kittens.
426680	426961	Yay.
426981	427841	I hate you.
433388	437251	I don't get video games, Mortal Kombat, Ripping Heads Off, HeHe, Funny.
437351	438111	I love that shit.
438232	440033	It's the real stuff.
440093	441614	My brain can totally tell the difference.
441654	442975	Fake blood in movies I hate.
443155	444756	Other people's blood I hate.
444856	446897	My own, I have no freaking problem with it.
446997	447477	Oh, even my own.
447497	452140	And they would not let me watch my surgery, but he did let me watch them do the anesthetic.
452180	452801	Hey, Shermie.
453109	456650	It took me a lot to look at the pictures of what it looked like.
456670	459551	Because they showed me a picture of my gallbladder before and after.
459891	463312	Like they actually put the laparoscopic camera in there when I had my surgery last October.
463653	466594	They actually showed the pictures of what my inside looked like with and without it.
466974	469555	It took me like four days before I was ready to look at that picture.
469955	472115	And then when I finally did, I was like, I looked at it.
472636	476697	And then I kind of like cocked my head to the side like a kitten looking at the TV or something.
477117	478818	And looked at it for about ten more seconds.
478878	480598	And I was like, oh my god, I'm going to barf.
481519	482439	I never looked at it again.
482919	484942	Shermie would not say anything for everybody, by the way.
485202	486964	She's a little mic-shy today.
486984	488526	She also needs a bath.
489146	494653	Anyhow, I don't want to talk anymore about internal body organs and stuff like that, unless it's into video games.
494973	497156	Which, by the way, it just...
498277	507443	Blows my mind, you know, when I hear this stuff about he who shall not be named, you know, Jack Voldemort, the once lawyer from Florida, who's, you know, a total attention whore.
507523	508184	The freaking loser.
508324	512367	Who, yeah, always talks about, you know, how video games lead to real violence.
512447	514388	I'm like, can't people tell the difference?
514929	517290	I really don't have a problem being able to distinguish the two.
517771	522274	I have a physical reaction to the real stuff as compared to the fake stuff.
522474	524235	Are you telling me a lot of people don't have that?
524635	525356	I know, I heard about it.
525376	526677	It's up on YouTube, apparently.
527157	529219	I'm going to have to watch that because I love bullshit.
529239	533362	They actually did one debunking the video game violence myth.
534123	535704	Like, you know, we haven't already.
535865	536405	Am I crazy?
537826	539107	Is there anyone in chat like me?
539127	545793	Because I see a lot of people going, oh, I went to that exhibit or, oh, cool, I think those exhibits are neat or I couldn't believe that they were real people.
546374	548656	Is anyone like me or am I just a big pussy?
548776	550197	Which I'm – that's fine.
550297	550817	I can admit it.
551078	551338	It's –
551678	553099	He brought Bob, it's really nothing.
553519	555201	There's a lot of people who have that problem.
555241	556962	I mean, it's just the way you're wired.
557222	559624	I didn't know that exhibit was there, otherwise I probably would have gone.
560625	563047	I really wanted to go, I just couldn't afford it at the time.
563067	570572	Actually, no, I wouldn't have wanted to go because it's an art exhibit, and that's just... I don't know, if they could bring the exhibit to me, then maybe.
570933	573034	Yay, I hear Gold Anthros has me, Sky.
573074	573715	Good, I'm not alone.
573955	575096	By the way... What?
575931	578292	My brother Phillip has now added me on Facebook.
578632	581313	My mother and my stepfather have added me on Facebook.
581753	585254	Why is my family suddenly becoming technologically with the times?
585375	593438	I need to figure out how to set up those filters on Facebook because I'm getting more and more coworkers on Facebook, which, you know, just my work life is very different from my personal life.
593518	594438	It's nothing personal.
595078	599222	Don't worry, Facebook will eventually be phased out or replaced by something else that's grander.
599642	606407	Soon enough, it'll happen and everybody won't realize it until the news reports on it retarded people.
606427	607909	Technically, he didn't add me.
607989	610431	He actually came up as a suggestion.
610591	614694	But my mom, my uncle, and my stepfather have added me all on Facebook.
614814	615094	Wow.
615755	619838	So my mom actually now knows that I am just as potty-mouthed as she is.
620198	620899	Completely off-topic here.
620919	620959	Um...
623869	625330	Oh, what else is new here on Orange Lounge Radio?
625350	626790	No, well, it's on the show.
627470	631792	It's about the show, but not necessarily on topic with corpses.
631832	632672	That's fine.
632712	633112	Let's move on.
633132	633552	All right, all right.
633572	640575	I was going to say, I found a hard drive lying around the other day, and I decided to look on.
640595	649918	I think it was the old hard drive out of my computer that was in the arcade cabinet, but it had some of the old shows on it from I don't know when.
650118	653079	I didn't even listen to any of them, but they're older shows.
653763	655965	I already backed it all up to my computer.
672236	674637	Can you burn me a DVD of the files?
674917	678539	Because we've had the listeners begging for episode one for years.
678919	681620	God, that's a bad migraine.
681901	686643	We didn't think the show was going to last a year back then, so we just labeled them all with the actual dates.
687083	689664	We didn't start numbering them until episode 40 or something.
689824	694246	Yeah, so that's why I have... I don't know if it's the first ones.
694847	697568	There's no year on it, so I was like, I don't know when these are from.
697779	700061	Dude, it's the first year of the show.
701143	703325	We need to put that stuff up in the archive that we have online.
703345	704847	I also found all my MAME ROMs on there.
704867	705347	I was like, sweet!
707229	707549	Nice.
708570	709011	Well, cool.
709071	709752	Hook up that drive.
710392	711934	Before we get the listeners too excited.
712034	712975	It completely works, too.
713015	715518	I don't know why it stopped working on yours.
715838	717400	It is partitioned like six times, though.
717420	717840	It's kind of weird.
718781	719022	Sweet.
719824	720164	DarkSakura.com
747353	749714	A lot of Sims 3 because that's really all I can play.
750535	759039	And the fortunate thing is that my mouse is one of the thumb track balls, so it keeps my hand in a neutral position and it doesn't really hurt so much.
759059	760039	So I've been playing a lot of that.
761520	764282	I tried playing some pinball, but yeah, that didn't quite work.
766408	778258	Also, I downloaded Loom last week on Steam, and I was gonna play that, and I loaded it up, and then I was like, oh wait, I have to do stuff, so I didn't play it.
778358	779459	But I do have it now.
780800	781680	That's really about it.
782721	783141	What'd you do?
783762	788306	This week, I played Grand Theft Auto 4, the modified version that I'm still playing.
788706	790547	Finally got it down to the point where...
791769	801035	We tweaked a few more things and we're at a point where we can kind of stop messing with it for a while until I find something really cool to do with it.
801215	803916	But yeah, it's been pretty fun.
803956	804537	Very crazy.
804617	806598	Probably pissing a lot of people off because I keep winning.
807739	808759	But that's not on purpose.
808799	816764	I mean, it's just I've adapted to the new weapons pretty quick and they forget that some of the weapons explode on contact with helicopters or flying cars.
817705	817845	And...
819389	819669	and so on.
845472	847754	I have to see if it'll actually be able to keep up with it.
847834	852237	Plus I found some other device that'll actually capture in HD, which is pretty cool.
852338	854759	So maybe I'll have to pick that up later on.
855420	857842	But yeah, that's really all I played.
857882	865348	I have a bunch of stuff sitting around like I should have been playing, but I've been busy working on the house and working on other things.
867710	870352	But yeah, it's basically Grand Theft Auto is the only thing I had time for.
872305	877168	Oh, I watched Jim play RPG Maker 3, which is kind of funny.
877269	878029	Oh yeah, that's right.
878069	880571	I saw the RPG Maker 3 on PlayStation 2.
880651	883373	That game seems very intricate for a PlayStation 2 game.
884213	885634	There's a lot that you can do with it.
885714	887375	You should have seen the old RPG Makers.
887495	888336	The SNES ones?
888596	893199	I'm surprised they don't have a new one out on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
893659	894880	Sadly enough, they didn't sell well.
895881	899443	I remember selling RPG Maker 3 and I thought, oh my god, this is fucking awesome.
899743	901785	But no one seemed to get it.
902685	904826	No one really likes to do anything they actually have to work at.
904926	906026	It's a very cult kind of game.
906226	906967	It is tough.
907247	917650	I like to say ZZT would be pretty awesome, but ZZT, the only difference between that and this, ZZT's game actually was pretty good.
918250	919671	The standalone game that came with it.
920811	926433	It didn't really show you how to make levels and stuff like that, but you could look at it and stuff.
926933	927113	But
928432	932793	I also had a really powerful editor with it, whereas RPG Maker 3, they have a really crappy game that's with it.
932853	934394	It's not very polished.
934454	936814	It's just kind of, hey, look, here's what you can do with the engine, done.
937214	940755	Wouldn't you expect, though, that somebody's going to bring an RPG Maker, especially the PlayStation 3?
941135	947157	Because look, you've got your little big planet, you've got your motor, what's the kart racing game that's coming out on PlayStation 3?
947197	947437	Mod Nation.
947457	948157	Mod Nation, thank you.
948537	951978	You've got these kind of games coming out that are about creating and sharing a community.
952018	954319	Wouldn't it seem logical that a role-playing game is going to come out at some point?
954379	954959	They should.
955079	955639	It would be cool.
956673	960117	But they probably won't.
960577	964922	They've had a few of them come out in Japan, and they just haven't really taken off.
965082	976635	Even the company that used to make them on PC went out of business, and now it's being carried on with people modding the actual files and doing freeware updates and stuff like that.
977890	978190	All right.
978290	979171	Well, is that it for your gaming week?
1003092	1004193	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1019105	1020106	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1041341	1056494	I feel really bad saying that because I'm sure this was created by an independent developer studio and some of these people took a lot of time and put energy into this game, but it's not worth your money because I think somewhere they got lost in the concept.
1057583	1061105	It's very clear that this game was very proud of its concept.
1061185	1061885	And it should be.
1061926	1064347	We're all sitting here going, oh, it sounds like a cool game.
1064707	1066408	And that's what really sold me on buying the game.
1066688	1070030	And it's a good thing Nintendo Wii doesn't have demos or I probably would have figured that out a lot sooner.
1070150	1070730	Huh, got me.
1072311	1079616	But the game itself is this just bad Pac-Man ripoff where you... I shouldn't say ripoff.
1079696	1080396	It's not a ripoff.
1080416	1085219	But it's a Pac-Man-ish type of game where you move through a maze and you collect, you know...
1086873	1089076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1107674	1110416	doesn't change by the time you get to the 128-bit version.
1110696	1116860	You're still playing the same damn game where you're moving throughout a maze trying to get the little cubes and avoid the monsters.
1117161	1122004	And it's just completely unimaginative when you get from the 4-bit to the super game.
1122604	1124226	I really think that they should...
1125546	1126647	Copyright Orange Zones Radio
1140131	1142171	The genre didn't involve at all in this game.
1142512	1144592	I mean, and, you know, some might argue with me.
1144692	1147653	I even tried, like, looking on the website, kind of seeing, like, who was in this game and stuff.
1147673	1161215	And the game definitely has its fans who are not responding well to the negative reviews out there on the internet saying, well, it's a game about competing for points and it's all this, you know, the game does evolve because in the Wii version you can flick the Wiimote to jump or something.
1161395	1162196	No, I'm sorry.
1162976	1163396	They're just...
1164196	1164976	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1187748	1189089	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1212305	1215166	32-bit version of the game has long load times.
1215646	1218727	So you actually have to sit there between each level and wait for the game to load.
1219027	1221007	When you know damn well it's not loading anything.
1221107	1223368	It's just a little, ha ha ha, isn't that funny?
1223928	1225948	I remember loading times.
1226888	1228389	So it's novel the game.
1229309	1232210	Basically, it's like, gee, weren't the 80s cool?
1232810	1233250	What was that?
1233550	1235290	Was that Goat Boy on Saturday Night Live?
1235591	1236731	Weren't the 80s cool?
1237251	1237851	It's like this.
1238111	1239892	No, we had bad hair and a flock of seagulls.
1240452	1241512	That's basically what it is.
1243795	1247037	So, unfortunately, BitBoy, the game, not a fan.
1247338	1247758	I'm sorry.
1247898	1258505	And I know it was a little tiny studio that put the game together, but my advice, you guys, if some of them should actually hear this show or the fans hear this show, you've got to evolve the genre of the game with the game.
1258585	1258986	For me...
1259546	1262548	The game didn't change between the 4-bit and the 128-bit.
1262628	1263649	What really changed?
1263709	1267512	The graphics, and now you can flick your Wiimote to jump or whatever.
1267892	1268513	It's not enough.
1269013	1280081	And in the end, it's still about competing for a high score, which works for an Atari 2600-style game, but games weren't about just competing for high scores when you moved on into the later generations.
1280562	1281483	I think that's what they forgot.
1281523	1285506	You know, that speaks so true to life, because really, people never change.
1285526	1288167	You just get older and then are able to flick their Wiimote.
1290658	1290998	Shut up.
1292618	1294179	So I don't recommend BitBoy, sorry.
1295579	1302620	As far as other games I played this week on the Wii, a newer type of exercise game that came out from EA called EA Active.
1303180	1310741	I got a gift card for my birthday I finally spent this week and I decided I was going to take the plunge because I've gained quite a bit of weight.
1311261	1314322	Last year I lost a lot of weight when I had my surgery.
1314962	1320443	As I'm sure a lot of you guys know, I didn't have gastric bypass, I had gallbladder surgery, but with all the sickness I had last year
1320523	1321303	Thanks for watching!
1340715	1351404	and I thought okay I'm going to pick up this new game this EA Active because what I like about it from what I'm hearing on the box is that it has this customized training program and that's what I need because Wii Fit, what's Wii Fit?
1351464	1367176	It's a clusterfuck of games and a way for you to measure your body fat once in a while but if I don't really know what I'm doing or what exercises I ought to be playing that's one thing that Wii Fit really falls short in is that it's just kind of all these exercises and you kind of have to know what parts of the body you want to exercise but
1367616	1369438	EA Active has a 30-day program.
1369898	1374162	So I bought the game, decided to check it out, and okay, it's not bad.
1375243	1378125	It does support the Wii Balance Board, but it's not required to play.
1378665	1384710	The game basically has two little add-ons that come with it that are extremely cheap, but you gotta consider the game costs $59.99.
1385711	1396220	One of the peripherals is basically a gigantic rubber band that you put these two straps on that's like a resistance band, which is actually... Resistance bands are great.
1396420	1400584	Yeah, it's actually kind of a creative, cheap exercise tool.
1400684	1401865	I gotta give him credit for that.
1402225	1405028	It actually works for doing bicep curls and things of that nature.
1406129	1413996	The game also comes with a strap that you strap to your leg that you put the nun check in that would be ten times more awesome if it didn't keep falling off my leg while I'm exercising.
1414296	1418660	Because even as tight as I will make that thing, inevitably it slips off my leg and starts to fall.
1419020	1421782	It needed to have something where I could maybe clip it onto my...
1422663	1423825	DarkSakura.com
1438440	1442084	I don't know, but it comes with this thing with an uncheck and it's kind of neat.
1442384	1443945	It allows for all these different types of activities.
1444206	1452433	And that's one thing I did notice about EA Active is that it is set up more like a, hey, this is an exercise program and we're going to show you all these videos that show you how to do the exercise.
1452474	1453635	Then you're going to do the exercise.
1454055	1461882	And I really felt like, granted, I don't have numbers to put side by side, but I did feel like EA Active has a higher variety of exercises in them.
1462603	1491732	as far as the fun factor though I don't think EA Active is necessarily has the cutesy fun look of Wii Fit the really motivating type of like you know cutesy let's have a good time Wii Party type of thing I didn't really see that in EA Active it's a little more serious and the graphics don't really even seem as good as Wii Fit but you have to consider what is this game for it's not there to be cute and amusing and entertaining it's there to help you exercise and it does get that job done fairly well my biggest bitch
1492492	1501814	Some of the trying to watch your body do these motions, the game is not very good at picking up.
1502034	1505015	There's one in particular, the lunges you do on your feet.
1505315	1509696	You basically lunge down, kind of like you crouch with one leg and bend your other leg at a 45 degree angle.
1510136	1512257	I am having the hardest time with the game picking this up.
1512317	1517478	And I'm doing them the right way and everything, but there's no way to tell the game, okay, I'm doing it, just move on.
1517958	1523121	Like, if you are not doing the exercise correctly, you kind of have to twist and move your body until the game picks up.
1523421	1525822	And I was literally sitting there for like a minute, two minutes.
1525842	1526843	That could injure you.
1526863	1527423	Yeah, exactly.
1527463	1529945	Trying to move around, getting the game to detect me, and it wouldn't do it.
1530305	1533306	So eventually I had to hit the button to skip the entire exercise.
1533547	1535208	Well, I didn't get credit for doing the exercise.
1535588	1539290	So I wish there was a way you could just like hit the two button or something and skip...
1539830	1541352	Thank you for watching!
1557273	1558974	None of them are recognizable songs.
1559174	1569097	And when you consider a company like EA usually licenses pretty good music for a game like Burnout and so on, the fact that they couldn't do the same for a game like this is really disappointing.
1569417	1576700	And maybe they're waiting to see how a game like this is received so that they can do it in the sequel or something like that, but I really just wanted to turn the damn thing off and put on my own music.
1576720	1577960	They're just having expansions.
1579649	1581610	They've already announced them, yeah.
1599997	1600497	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1627623	1629184	Thank you for watching!
1646966	1652108	or hello, support the goddamn SD memory card, put your own MP3s on there.
1652188	1652808	Right, right.
1653448	1657430	And the other thing I should point out, you don't have to have the balance board to play this game.
1657890	1664172	I think it goes a long way in making some of the other activities a little more fun, but technically, you don't have to have it.
1664532	1668314	So if you're willing to endure without the balance board, you can pick up this game for $59.99.
1669854	1697916	not a bad deal so on EA's part that's actually kind of smart because it puts out an exercise game that's cheaper than Wii Fit yet also enhances Wii Fit I gotta credit EA with that one so that was pretty much my gaming week was those two games and I'm still feeling sore from just the two days of Wii workout I did earlier in the week I skipped yesterday I have to do some when I go home tonight because I don't want to miss a day because I have to be thin and beautiful before the Reno show in August so alright
1698982	1700685	Anyhow, let's see.
1701126	1702228	I just got an idea, by the way.
1702288	1702628	What's that?
1702969	1706094	Well, I was showing off screen caps of the house that I made in The Sims.
1706735	1708819	I'm thinking about doing OLR exclusives.
1709810	1710210	Go for it.
1710450	1710991	Yeah, why not?
1711251	1711491	Why not?
1711531	1718276	So, I will do, as soon as I can actually get to a point where I can save that property, I will do exclusive Sims.
1718396	1719657	I should make ones of you guys.
1720097	1720497	Go for it.
1720537	1721138	I've got one of me.
1721598	1722078	I'll be fine.
1722418	1723459	I'd be fine with that.
1724240	1728583	Reading some comments from chat, chat.orangehoundsradio.com, Xenocore says, Rob, screw this EA crap.
1729023	1732045	Get you some P90X interactive online extreme.
1732105	1733726	Work out until your insides come out.
1734326	1736108	I'm not aware of this game.
1736128	1737809	Maybe it's something I need to do more research on.
1737989	1739510	I'd be okay with looking that up.
1740970	1741670	Sounds interesting.
1741790	1748152	I like the idea of an online game where I can kind of get motivated with friends and in a community.
1748472	1752333	I think that's one big thing that the Wii workout programs are missing.
1752853	1753853	And I think, you know what?
1754493	1764876	I really hope that when Project Natal comes out a big, big exercise game is not far behind because I think one place where Xbox Live is going to really blow these Wii games out of the water is the online component.
1764936	1766876	It's going to be very interesting to see what that brings to the table.
1767216	1768197	But I'm curious about the other game.
1768217	1769417	I'll check it out, I guess.
1769497	1770918	I don't think it's necessarily a game.
1771378	1776402	It's an extreme home fitness training system, they call it.
1776762	1777402	Oh, God.
1778263	1778623	Sucker.
1779444	1779984	I'm a sucker.
1781025	1781525	What is it?
1782186	1784868	It's just like working out hard.
1785188	1785668	Interesting.
1786209	1786729	I'll check it out.
1786749	1787269	I'll Google it.
1788010	1788270	All right.
1788350	1791512	Anyhow, let's move on, though, with some housekeeping tonight quickly.
1792573	1794374	Xenocore says, please tell me he knows that's a joke.
1794454	1795515	No, I didn't know it's a joke.
1795615	1796476	I'd never heard of it before.
1797383	1798524	Thank you, Loki, for doing the research.
1816788	1823936	Rob, I was also going to say, I believe they did a blog for EA Sports Active, the 30-day challenge.
1824957	1827240	And I think, I don't know if they're starting it again.
1827460	1831444	I guess there's someone else that's taking the 30-day challenge.
1831484	1836429	Peter Moore basically said that you'll lose weight after 30 days or something like that.
1838757	1853380	I was trying to find they had one person that actually completed it and I wanted to see what the results were unfortunately I cannot oh here we go you know what's funny I am using the Wii Fit channel to weigh myself in every day
1855227	1859129	J-Rod in chat said, Richard Simmons presents Sweetin' to the 80s.
1860269	1860849	You know what?
1861309	1863130	I would actually buy a game like that.
1863210	1866712	Say what you want about how odd Richard Simmons is, but you know what?
1866912	1868212	He's a highly motivating guy.
1868312	1872974	And what bad thing has he ever done besides being a little bit weird, right?
1876069	1877150	Also, my mother loves him.
1877871	1878252	No joke.
1878452	1879393	I think he's fantastic.
1879413	1880094	I think he is too.
1880414	1883378	This person actually did it for 30 days.
1883618	1885560	They started off that their weight was 235 and some other...
1890137	1892998	Habits he also, I guess, brought on.
1893659	1902522	He drank half his body weight in fluid ounces of water, which is, you know, you're supposed to, so like 120 ounces of water a day.
1902542	1916548	This is roughly 500 calories before resting, like 150 grams of protein, four to six small meals, avoided carbs, and plenty of fiber.
1917528	1918569	Well, anyways, besides all that,
1920588	1923994	and did the exercises, they lost 12.5 pounds in three days.
1924835	1925075	Hmm.
1926137	1926458	Not bad.
1926994	1927815	Yeah, not bad.
1927895	1930776	And you notice, though, it's about changing other lifestyles, too.
1931217	1935940	Which the game will tell you, it'll kind of walk you through that, but it's not like the game can tell what you ate yesterday.
1936040	1944385	Yeah, I mean, drinking water's good, eating lots of, you know, meals, you know, smaller meals instead of big meals, you know, something I really needed to do.
1945305	1946866	But, you know, I starve myself until lunch.
1947987	1948647	That's not healthy.
1949168	1949988	I know it's not.
1950308	1955232	And then I go get the third pounder burger, which is really not healthy, but I don't care.
1955252	1955732	Yeah.
1956747	1958208	All right, let's get into some actual gaming.
1976667	1977048	DarkSakura.com
1992948	1993288	Shut up.
1993348	1994569	I wouldn't mind a tapeworm.
1994869	1995830	You guys are disgusting.
1997931	2002915	One thing that's important about these types of games, you're not going to get thin just buying the game and looking at the box.
2003455	2006697	At the same time, you're not going to get thin buying the game and playing it for five minutes a day.
2007157	2014562	At the same time, you're not going to get thin by buying the game, playing it for 30 minutes one day out of an entire week.
2014782	2017684	You have to make a commitment to exercise five times a week.
2018864	2038889	and I'm taking that walking class they say you need to get your heart rate up for 20 minutes a day or at least 3 times a week get your heart rate up to at least 65% of your max heart rate and then hold it there for at least 20 minutes and that's the way to do it
2039557	2043439	All right, so think carefully before you jump into one of these Wii exercise programs.
2043499	2049463	I think they can work because I think anything is better than your big butt sitting on the couch playing a game for 30 minutes.
2049503	2052325	I mean, if you're up and moving, that's certainly better than that.
2052745	2054166	So anyway, let's move on.
2054206	2058429	Let's get into some gaming stories tonight, and Loki's going to start us off with some gaming discussion.
2058939	2066421	Yes, Dragon Quest IX came out just last week, and of course, it's already sold millions of copies.
2066481	2071263	In fact, it sold 2.3 million copies in two days, which is pretty awesome.
2071643	2076965	Totally blowing away any other game that was coming out that week, or actually even out at the time.
2077845	2080986	Just completely knocked everything out of the water as far as sales goes.
2081446	2084487	But of course, you know, Dragon Quest is a huge series in Japan.
2084827	2087748	Not so much over here, but, you know, hey, we're working on it.
2088809	2092614	That's pretty cool.
2093355	2099604	It's not a big surprise that it did well, but hopefully it'll do well when it comes over here.
2102474	2103214	It probably won't.
2103835	2105355	Well, it's not going to do that good.
2105495	2112017	I think definitely Dragon Quest has its fans that will justify Square translating the game and bringing it out over here.
2112477	2117158	Although I think they do lose a little bit in sales from not doing it a little faster.
2117499	2122040	Because I think you do get people that import the game and or steal the game while it's out in Japan.
2122080	2124621	So I think they need to get their turnaround times down a bit.
2125141	2127821	But I think the game will still sell decent enough.
2127902	2128522	But let's just face it.
2129722	2149763	It's not Halo or Madden or the things we go crazy about in this country True Although Dragon Quest IX certainly has its fans Although people do go crazy for Final Fantasy I think Final Fantasy has a bit more name recognition And also keep in mind that Dragon Quest had a different name when we first got them over here, remember?
2150106	2151407	Super Nintendo Generation Final Fantasy 2 and 3
2172099	2173520	True, true, I understand.
2173580	2175422	Like, that was a big marketing push, too.
2175482	2180906	I think even though we had Dragon Quest VII was out on the PlayStation 1, I don't remember ever hearing about it.
2181006	2183748	It was really Dragon Quest VIII where they really started pushing it.
2184028	2186990	But that was also the first game under the Square Enix banner, if I remember right.
2187611	2191533	Maybe Enix just didn't have the marketing push here in America that it did over in Japan.
2191574	2192474	I think that's a big part of it.
2192494	2193215	Maybe.
2195092	2200614	I hear this game has been getting a lot of negative feedback on Amazon.com, although I guess that ultimately doesn't matter now, does it?
2201294	2203695	It's the sales that drive it, not the ratings.
2204515	2207336	Although it would be interesting to see what happens next week.
2208336	2211237	You know, if the sales numbers take a big dive or what happens.
2213318	2215679	Orland in chat says, Final Fantasy is dead.
2216419	2216679	Really?
2217506	2217926	I don't know.
2218126	2219627	I think Final Fantasy XIII is going to do well.
2219647	2220648	I don't think that it's dead.
2221308	2223169	I don't think it's... I think that it'll lull.
2223710	2230534	I don't think it's as popular as it was in the PlayStation 1 era, but I think the games will still sell like crazy.
2230554	2235696	I think XIII is going to be the biggest selling RPG on both platforms, both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2236337	2239259	But it's still not going to sell Halo-sized numbers, that's for sure.
2239579	2241600	But it'll be a big game.
2242821	2243901	Maybe combined it will.
2244902	2245222	I don't know.
2246886	2248187	X Mark the End of Good Final Fantasy Games
2267486	2268507	is that it really missed out.
2269527	2272748	Final Fantasy XI, that's a whole other thing.
2273509	2276630	Maybe Final Fantasy XI should have just been Final Fantasy Online.
2276990	2280752	I think the whole fact that they did an online game with a number really turned some people off.
2281052	2281492	But guess what?
2281532	2283233	It's going to happen again with Final Fantasy XIV.
2283593	2286114	I don't care because I'm buying Final Fantasy XIV.
2286134	2288175	XI was fun for a while.
2288215	2293438	Granted, it had its rough spots in the beginning, but now a lot of that stuff has been patched out.
2293518	2293678	But
2295274	2298016	I still enjoyed it even with all the frustrations of it.
2299197	2303040	I would still be playing it today if I had the time to play it, but I don't.
2303380	2304581	So I'm not.
2305882	2306563	But it was awesome.
2306903	2308104	I mean, I wouldn't be going to WoW.
2308904	2309445	Fuck that shit.
2310084	2312865	Actdeft reminds us in chat, Famitsu gave it a perfect score.
2312905	2318548	That's right, Dragon Quest IX got a perfect score in Famitsu, which is the first... Damn near impossible, too.
2318608	2323470	It's the first Dragon Quest game to do so, actually, which is kind of surprising.
2323850	2331434	So it's funny because you have that, and then you have the Amazon.com reviews where a lot of the users are slamming the game, but I don't know, is that just angry internet wank?
2331994	2334135	Yeah, the internet is angry.
2334535	2337797	I don't know how to tell until I actually buy the game myself, but we'll see.
2339408	2355059	by the way, I guess more and more games I remember when that was a hella hard thing to get was a perfect 40 in Famitsu Magazine there was only like 4 games that had it for the longest time now there's like 10 or 11 that have gotten a perfect 10 yeah, they're starting to move to the IGN scoring method there
2355459	2359402	Apparently, Nintendogs was one of the games that got a perfect 40 in the history.
2359422	2364625	Yeah, it was a perfect 40 for the first 40 minutes, and then after that, it's just like, wait, why am I playing this?
2364806	2365206	Exactly.
2366026	2371590	Also, Final Fantasy XII was the first Final Fantasy game to get a perfect 40 for Famitsu Magazine.
2371930	2372911	So some would argue that...
2374352	2374752	Xenocore
2392876	2395218	That's all we've got on Dragon Quest IX for now.
2395278	2397019	I think we'll come back to it a little later in the show.
2397059	2400061	But I want to talk about The Conduit, which is a game that came out here in the U.S.
2400541	2405024	And it was supposed to be a really big title over here, but I don't think the game's been selling very well, has it?
2405284	2405424	Nope.
2405964	2406765	No, that's sad.
2407045	2408446	What's wrong with The Conduit?
2408626	2409587	Why is it not selling well?
2410147	2416211	It's because it's more of a mature type of game, and unfortunately there's not a lot of those people on the Wii.
2417751	2418171	Interesting.
2418251	2421414	So now maybe Nintendo's marketing is coming back to bite them a little bit.
2422195	2424616	Although, in the scope of things, does it really matter?
2424897	2427759	No, it really comes down to Nintendo being retarded.
2428039	2429680	And it's retarded in their own benefit.
2429720	2430201	And here's why.
2430561	2435345	Because with the GameCube, they were frustrated that the system was viewed as a system for kids.
2435845	2442250	And that they couldn't get any good third-party franchises that were more mature to work out for them.
2442290	2444812	They thought, okay, the Wii is going to be different.
2444832	2446794	It's going to be this all-around system that everyone's going to love.
2447114	2451197	Except they had Resident Evil 4, which was one of the best third-party games to come out in the last generation.
2451217	2453659	Well, there's exceptions to all the rules, but that's not the point.
2453939	2462425	The point is, then the Wii comes out, and instead of, hey, we're going to take what we learned from the GameCube, and we're going to make this better, and we're going to market it to everybody.
2463105	2468749	No, we're just going to market it to kids now, and casual gamers, and grandmas, and go with that.
2469450	2475494	And really, if you ask me, I don't think they give a crap about third-party, mature-rated games.
2476314	2490748	I think it's a good genre to have on that system because there's people like me that don't want to go play Mario Tennis or Mario Soccer or Mario Badminton or whatever the hell they're going to come out with next.
2491969	2498274	So Conduit, if I had time, once again, it's another game that I have that I just haven't gotten to play yet.
2498755	2500697	If I got a chance to play it, then yeah...
2501761	2503981	I would probably enjoy it, because I enjoyed Mad World a lot.
2504461	2507302	And this was one of those games that was high voltage studios.
2507402	2509942	It was really impressive, the tech demo and everything.
2511163	2519684	But I think overall, I mean, it's a good game, but it wasn't like, oh my god, this is better than Metroid, better than everything.
2520084	2524145	I mean, they've done a lot of things right with it, but at the same time, it's a very generic shooter.
2524745	2529526	A lot of the same cliches that you would see in Halo and pretty much every other sci-fi shooter out there.
2529546	2531046	It had a really good online...
2540233	2542574	J-Rod says Conduit is a very mediocre title.
2542634	2546316	It's only hyped because it's on the Wii, the barren wasteland of third-party games.
2546656	2551358	And then FearTheClaw says it's a passable shooter, but not the amazing game it should have been, but not really a bad game.
2552438	2556860	J-Rod also continues on to say people also slam Conduit because it wasn't Metroid Prime on the Wii.
2557580	2558321	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2574153	2576634	Hacks, by the way, you can also hack it online.
2577294	2579695	The hacker said, everything is virtually unprotected.
2580115	2587897	All values can be edited fairly easy, and there's virtually no sign of an attempt at hiding values, fixing bugs, or preventing online hackers.
2588537	2591338	The hacker goes on to say that hacking online is cake.
2591698	2597040	Quote, the only difference is in the online mode, the game sends the variables in real time to the server.
2597720	2600542	And apparently some patch codes actually came out for the game.
2601182	2607787	And I guess initially he altered them to actually make the save files corrupt for anybody that used them.
2609428	2615032	And I guess he's working with the people that created the game to see who used them.
2615972	2617734	And then they're going to ban them.
2618274	2622457	Whoever installed this cheat, they're actually going to ban, which is kind of an interesting end to the story.
2622877	2623738	Yeah, it's an interesting end.
2623778	2625319	The story scene is they can't do that.
2626397	2627578	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2648229	2660700	where they leave everything in very well-documented text files on the disc itself and everything is labeled very properly with infinite ammo, check one, toggle this on.
2661081	2662923	It's just ridiculous.
2663503	2666746	Thank you, Rockstar, for doing that because it's awesome to mod your games.
2666826	2670848	Well, look, but if you were playing a modded game online, you're kind of a butt anyway.
2670988	2672789	I mean, it's one thing to do it in private circles.
2672869	2673930	I know that's what you do, Loki.
2673970	2681014	But if you actually go on Xbox Live and play these, you know, modded for infinite health and all this stuff, you're kind of a butt to begin with.
2681034	2681394	Well, yeah.
2682394	2686098	But if you want to hack your personal one-player game, have a ball.
2686318	2692364	Or private circle games where everybody has infinite health and everybody has access to the same hacks, then fine.
2692725	2695327	That's up to you and your hard-earned money.
2695628	2701974	But going on Xbox Live or going on Nintendo Wi-Fi connection with these hacked games, you're kind of a douche.
2702274	2702815	Let's face it.
2702875	2703215	Well, yeah.
2703295	2707659	And there's a lot of people, unfortunately, Mario Kart's been kind of ruined by it.
2708460	2711523	And I'm not sure about Call of Duty or anything like that.
2711603	2714765	But there's a lot of the popular Smash Brothers.
2714805	2716507	There's a lot of people hacking that kind of stuff.
2719492	2719812	You're fucked!
2741005	2741345	Too bad.
2741365	2745608	Couldn't they do something on the server side though that says if this does not equal this then boot user?
2745628	2748350	That's all they're going to be able to do as far as patching the game goes.
2748390	2755174	They can only do it on the server end and maybe banning the IPs of those people or something like that.
2755774	2758976	That would be the way to go if they could do that or ban the MAC address.
2759276	2768982	That's actually what they've been doing is banning the MAC address but once again all people are doing is hex editing the memory to alter their MAC address and boom they're online again.
2769542	2769762	So...
2772560	2774862	Oh well, it's bound to happen with every game.
2774882	2777304	Alright, well, there you go.
2777524	2784730	The game's being out there and being hacked, so if you want to hack this game, have fun, but the only thing I would say with that, don't go online.
2784750	2786851	If you're going to hack, don't go online with it.
2786871	2790534	Yeah, I'd totally play that game with infinite ammo and stuff like that, because that's just fun.
2791315	2795098	Just like doing that with Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.
2795678	2798621	I played that game with infinite health and infinite rockets.
2799141	2799782	That was a blast.
2800923	2801103	Nice.
2803151	2804472	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2833243	2836344	Like all the lolcats in the universe.
2836384	2836944	Sure, sure.
2837484	2840285	We've heard to death about Scribblenauts this game.
2840785	2843946	I have a bad feeling this is going to turn out like Nintendogs.
2844927	2852509	Call me crazy, I have a bad feeling this game is going to go the way of Nintendogs where it's got all this hype pre-release and then when it comes out people are going to be like, okay.
2853409	2855770	We'll be all into it, into it, into it, and then a month later.
2855790	2858591	Yeah, we read all the funny stuff online already.
2859710	2860270	Well, I don't know.
2860290	2863211	I just thought it was noteworthy that they put out the UK date.
2863551	2869893	No, it's definitely noteworthy that it's coming to the UK as well, especially when those guys usually get screwed out of releases for a long, long time after we do.
2870654	2873514	But, you know, again, it doesn't change my opinion on the game.
2873534	2883598	We need that kind of technology with LittleBigPlanet where we can spawn, you know, babies attached to meat and bird lions.
2885098	2886559	I think they have the suicide babies.
2886599	2887559	Did you try to see if that was there?
2888498	2890139	I haven't given up hope on this game yet.
2890199	2892080	Maybe there'll be something on Xbox Live or something.
2892100	2896321	It'd be kind of cool where you could do that in a big sandbox on Xbox Live.
2897001	2897321	I don't know.
2898082	2900963	There's only so much Scribblenauts talk I can take.
2901483	2904244	But also with that, they'd really not be able to...
2904844	2907026	They have to super monitor the online content.
2932037	2932357	Work?
2932397	2933218	Who wants to do that?
2933338	2933798	Exactly.
2933878	2934639	No one wants to do work.
2937040	2942883	We have someone in chat asking, they didn't change their nickname, so I don't know what their name is, but does anyone know what the game is going to be about?
2943083	2944024	Is there a story or what?
2944343	2951986	Yeah, the story is basically that you are collecting these star pieces, and I'm not really sure why.
2952106	2954487	Maybe to put the stars back in the sky or something like that.
2954607	2955208	You know, cheesy.
2955868	2966292	And then basically you just go through different levels and try to solve the puzzles given, you know... With an entire dictionary of weapons available to you.
2966352	2968273	But they're also, you know...
2968783	2975694	They have pars on each of the levels that you're trying to get the level finished with so many objects spawn or something like that.
2976255	2977457	So it could be interesting.
2977557	2979039	And then the level editor will be nice.
2979780	2982284	So Meat Baby will probably not solve every level.
2983186	2983967	I'm going to try, though.
2985267	2985907	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3012412	3013073	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3030669	3031910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3050762	3051423	I don't see why not.
3051823	3059409	It's kind of interesting, though, that they would do this and then still have Last.fm integration with the Xbox and not their own service.
3059529	3063112	That is very strange, unless Microsoft were going to buy Last.fm or something.
3063692	3064993	But it's strange.
3066114	3071418	Yeah, and they also have the Zune music library that they could be integrating with that as well.
3071898	3075181	So maybe they're just going to have all these different services all tied together or something like that.
3075669	3077290	I'm so glad we don't have to put up with that anymore.
3096109	3098591	Yeah, it's kind of nice, I've got to say, all things considered.
3098651	3103695	As much as I miss having our own station that we have control of, things have worked out over here.
3103935	3107438	Definitely we have Bobby as a lead-in, which has been very cool, and all that.
3107498	3113343	So, yeah, I mean, the move was a good thing, but Live 365, this sounds kind of like that.
3113543	3117025	So it'll be interesting to see if all the ads are for the ad-free service.
3118907	3125052	Very strange that they would have this when Last.fm is coming out as well, unless Last.fm is not going to work the way we want to, or...
3126616	3127137	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3144673	3145934	But it would sure make sense, of course.
3146234	3146414	Yeah.
3147275	3148656	So, I don't know.
3148676	3149357	I guess we will see.
3150057	3152479	Robocoon in chat says, I've checked up on Life 365.
3152559	3153560	Damn, it's gone downhill.
3153980	3164589	Actually, I did too because I heard some of those, the rates and the fees that kind of pushed us out of there in the first place when they decided to skyrocket the, you know, I understand why they were doing that.
3164609	3167531	They were doing that in response to the government increase.
3167871	3169993	I heard some of that got resolved this past week.
3170013	3173175	So I went to Life 365 to see if their rates had dropped for broadcasting.
3173355	3173496	No.
3173556	3173756	No.
3174096	3174956	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3196201	3197782	Well, I get it though.
3197983	3205168	I don't understand why record labels keep trying to raise the prices of what it's going to cost for these broadcasters to do it.
3205509	3210252	I mean, they are putting internet radio out of business, which is too bad because they're biting the hand that feeds them.
3210613	3213135	How do people find new songs, the radio and stuff?
3213175	3219180	If radio gets stupid or is just all ad-ridden, people are just going to go listen to the same old shit on their iPods.
3219520	3221141	That's why most people have left radio.
3221401	3225405	I think they're doing a dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb thing by demanding these higher rates.
3226815	3228017	Stupid, stupid, stupid.
3228338	3229841	I stopped listening to the radio a long time ago.
3230542	3232024	I rarely listen to it.
3232064	3234629	I wish I had XM Sirius in my car.
3235230	3236492	My next car, I want to get that.
3237113	3237434	We'll see.
3238496	3239616	XNA, but for Rock Band songs.
3260174	3273477	Apparently anyone, if you're in an independent band or if you're on a major label, if you want to get your song into Rock Band, you'll be able to essentially take your master versions with this software that's coming out, create your own music files, and then be able to put them in Rock Band.
3273977	3283979	After they go through a service that makes sure that the songs are actually playable and have a reasonable difficulty, in other words, not too easy and not too difficult, and aren't stolen.
3284239	3284399	Yeah.
3284699	3291883	So they'll all have to go through this kind of peer review service, but you'll be able to charge between 50 cents and $3, and you'll get 30% of whatever the track sales are.
3292223	3295825	By the way, it's not going to go in the same Rock Band storefront that exists now.
3295885	3301208	It's like a separate Rock Band store, but the songs will still load and be playable in Rock Band.
3301768	3307732	So very interesting sort of development here, where now anyone can get a song into Rock Band, essentially.
3307912	3311674	And Harmonix says to Activision, and that's how you do it!
3312574	3313215	Seriously, this is...
3314295	3315376	Thanks for watching!
3337040	3338921	and you're going to see a lot of content on there now.
3339081	3340541	Just like loads of it.
3340701	3342722	It's going to be all these bands you've probably never heard of.
3342742	3343002	I know.
3343022	3344443	I think you're going to see a lot of crap.
3344843	3347024	But there's some people that are really into indie bands.
3347064	3354526	And I think where this is going to come in really handy is like let's say you have this indie band who's trying to sell CDs that's doing these concerts in local areas.
3354886	3362389	Now they can say, hey, check out our song on Rock Band and we're going to have flyers at the door that tell you how to get on the store and download our song on Rock Band.
3362429	3362649	I think...
3363149	3363950	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3384867	3390169	You kind of map it out via MIDI and stuff, and you decide where you want your frets to go and that kind of stuff.
3390469	3396212	And you can do it with the audio for singing and that kind of stuff as well.
3396332	3401554	Granted, it's going to take a little bit of work, but when you think about it, it doesn't cost them anything to upload their tracks.
3402034	3405295	So, yeah, they're only making 30% off of it, but you know what?
3405315	3406776	30% for no cost is excellent.
3406796	3408777	I mean, there's no publishing fees or anything.
3414739	3431001	and Deathwishing in chat is yelling fucking punk I want to see a lot of indie punk and you know what actually and this kind of ties into something Bobby was talking about on his show tonight the Bobby Blackwolf show which is always on before us on All Games Radio at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on AllGames.com on Sunday nights right before we tape
3431502	3433123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3451397	3458183	Somebody could upload a music file of a kitten drumming, and as long as it's of a reasonable difficulty, you could put it on the service.
3458343	3459304	That would be awesome.
3459404	3459664	Right?
3459924	3463647	I would like to see some drum and bass songs in there, like something like Pendulum or something.
3463667	3464548	That would be awesome.
3464688	3467730	Is there anywhere in the rules say it has to be a particular type of song?
3468131	3473035	I mean, I think it does say that you can't have, you know, fuck, shit, cock, piss, you know, as your lyrics.
3473495	3478659	You know, you have to still have a family clean version of the song, but there's nothing to prevent you from doing, you know...
3479600	3482422	The Kitten Band with their hit single Meow Meow Meow.
3482582	3486826	You know, there's nothing to stop you from doing these type of experimental stuff.
3487146	3487826	That's awesome.
3488727	3489988	And in fact, I think they need that.
3493010	3498915	And now everybody in the chat room is yelling out, early green day, tons of ska, and so on and so on.
3498995	3501437	And sure, everybody's going to be clamoring for this certain type of thing.
3502017	3505980	But what this opens that up to possibly be a reality, which is kind of cool.
3506361	3507541	You know what also is cool?
3508422	3509283	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3527423	3528183	40 Microsoft points.
3528503	3533487	Okay, so, you know, how many of us don't already have 40 points just kind of left over waiting to be spent?
3533807	3537689	If you've ever used the Microsoft Store before, you know, on Xbox Live, you usually have leftover points.
3537970	3540852	It's part of the annoyance of having to buy clusters of points at a time.
3541172	3546495	People are going to easily drop the 40 points, just click a button on the computer, and then it'll download next time you power on your Xbox.
3546855	3548997	I do this all the time, by the way, for demos and things.
3549357	3552980	I'll go on to the Xbox Live Store, queue up the things I want to download, and then...
3553780	3557241	When I turn on my Xbox, they just come in like magic, which is cool.
3560662	3563043	And some comments in chat.
3563143	3568204	Actdeft says, meaning I don't have to pay $99 for the service unless I want to upload songs.
3569624	3572185	Not just anybody can upload songs.
3572245	3575286	You have to be the copyright owner in order to basically upload the songs.
3575886	3578027	And the other part I should have mentioned, you do have to be...
3578987	3582029	A member of the XNA development community in order to do this.
3582349	3584630	But they are really selling this.
3584690	3594195	They're going to have its own little specialized little corner of the marketplace and all this stuff where a rock band developer's community, which I do think it's going to be pretty big.
3594995	3615642	I think it's going to be tough to find the gems you want amongst all the garbage that's about to hit on this but if artists are smart about linking to the Xbox Live Marketplace and making it very easy for you to drop money on their music I think this has the potential to do very well especially for a little tiny artist
3615922	3632608	and you know not necessarily us because we don't have time to put into it but I know there's many websites out there that rate and review all the community games that come out and I'm sure they're going to do the same thing when all these independent well you'll still be able to get the 30 second samples just like you can in regular rock band too
3634574	3638075	So you can actually listen to the song and I'm sure most artist websites will have it.
3638095	3646058	That would be awesome to make like a 30 second portion of your song really kick ass and then the rest is just banging pots and pans and that's it.
3647279	3656722	I think that you, myself, and DarkSakura should all get a song on Xbox Live Marketplace that is us banging pots and pans together and yelling incoherent lyrics.
3656742	3657743	Wait, we need a ukulele.
3658470	3660632	Deathwishing says, this is just what the music industry needed, Rob.
3660652	3660792	I agree.
3688024	3689804	How about something a little less disastrous, Rob?
3689864	3690564	All right, how about it?
3691105	3696866	Well, you know, Sony's been all, ooh, PSI, it's so cool, it's so cool.
3697446	3714249	Well, actually, SCEE's head of developer services, Kishi Hirani, was saying that it can actually recognize face and individual feature, that it can, oh, sorry, that it will be able to detect gender
3715190	3720488	Age of Face, different facial features, and tell what your expression is.
3722012	3747746	and we actually did a whole presentation on it and saying that it actually tracks facial movement it's supposed to be part of the motion controller demo so I actually think that that's kind of neat because then like if they do a game that you can map your features onto your character or something you can actually map your animations as well it'd be almost realistic expression
3749485	3754748	Well, I hope they actually do something with this instead of just releasing the demo and just going, oh, well, that was cool.
3755248	3764152	And that's it because they have those really cool tech demos where, you know, it was like a Lunar and Lander type of game where you actually draw your landscape and then you go play it and stuff.
3764472	3767313	And they showed that wonderful tech demo that was like combat.
3767614	3768514	And did those ever come out?
3768834	3772016	No, because they were tech demos and that was it.
3772196	3773496	So, awesome.
3773556	3775477	You know, it can detect, you know, faces and stuff.
3775818	3778559	But what the hell are you going to do with it is what I ask.
3779099	3781180	I just gave a suggestion of what they could do with it.
3781920	3785001	Other than, you know, shine it up and shove it up their ass.
3785101	3787823	Or better yet, when the hell are they going to do something with it?
3787883	3792304	Because the last I checked, Home still doesn't have trophy support in it.
3793685	3793845	What?
3793865	3794665	That was announced what?
3794825	3795446	How many years ago?
3795466	3800748	That would be kind of neat if your avatar in Home smiled and frowned as you were smiling and frowning sitting there on the couch or whatever.
3800908	3806170	Or your face is just left open agape at the whole hamsters versus humans type thing.
3806190	3807370	That would be kind of cool.
3807971	3808071	Um...
3808871	3810031	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3832136	3833036	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3854303	3877931	and you know another thing too remember the mind controller I think it was for an Atari system that it read your facial expression to control the game well what if they did have games that relied on your expression or special type of interface that you would be able to like you know if you blink to move one way or lean your head to the side to go one way you know
3878471	3879892	How about just a goddamn controller?
3880832	3883193	Why do we have to complicate things?
3883573	3893676	I was just saying that actually would be something if they created a kind of interface in a lot of games that would read motion for people who really can't play games who might enjoy it.
3894893	3896575	Oh, so like making it more handicap accessible.
3896835	3897275	Exactly.
3897415	3898676	That might be kind of neat, actually.
3898796	3908645	You know, if it's recognizing the motions of your face, the motions of your head, you could easily lean your head to the side to go one way, lean it to go the other way, lean forward, lean back.
3909266	3915671	You know, if it's reading eyebrows or your eyes, you can blink to jump or something or stick out your tongue to...
3916892	3918193	Fart or something, I don't know.
3918393	3918853	Interesting.
3918893	3919873	Stick out your tongue to fart.
3919913	3920474	Really, Jamie.
3920714	3922014	I was thinking of a verb.
3923075	3923395	Okay.
3923675	3927197	You can do X with this part to do verb.
3928077	3931519	DarkTetsuya in chat says maybe that's what Nintendo's heart monitor thingy is for.
3933020	3933660	For farting?
3933980	3936761	No, I'm assuming he's referring to the exercise gaming.
3937422	3937822	Perhaps.
3938982	3939703	That could be part of it.
3939783	3944465	Yeah, I'm sure Fit++ will now support that as well.
3945561	3946703	Goody Gumdrops.
3947745	3948025	Yeah.
3948666	3949147	Unfortunate.
3950189	3958904	Anyhow, we'll see what kind of games develop with this new technology, but for now we're going to talk about the games that are coming out right now as we travel the world with some release dates.
3959252	3968855	Yes, and we have wonderful games utilizing technology as well, including Sins of a Solar Empire Game of the Year Edition, which is coming out on PC this week.
3970295	3972216	Other fun stuff, GeForce.
3972656	3974577	Okay, well, maybe that's not fun, but it's a game.
3975217	3984520	GeForce is coming out as well on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, and PSP, based on the animated...
3986138	4005416	Hamster, not Hamster, Guinea Pig, Secret Agent Movie Which, by the way, the PS3 and Xbox 360 are in 3D Rock Band Country Track Pack is coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii this week as well Um...
4007412	4013475	Also on Xbox 360, we have Watchmen The End is Nigh Parts 1 and 2.
4013515	4017176	And Watchmen The End is Nigh Complete on the PS3.
4017637	4018777	Those are available as well.
4019798	4022859	Little King's Story, which is coming out on the Wii.
4022879	4029022	I think it got nominated for Best Strategy Game out of E3.
4029502	4030762	So that one should be pretty good.
4031363	4032183	Coming from XSEED.
4033664	4033884	And...
4036193	4037634	There's not too much else here.
4044237	4054641	Yeah, looks like, of course, you know, it's not necessarily during the week, but Wii Sports Resort.
4055641	4057402	Actually, that's next week.
4057602	4057902	Never mind.
4058183	4058603	Jumping ahead.
4059483	4059863	That's it.
4060924	4061044	Oh.
4061665	4062245	Oh, sorry.
4062365	4063146	Completely missed this.
4063606	4064187	King of Fighters 12.
4064247	4065808	You know, that's a little bit important.
4065828	4067569	That's coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3.
4067889	4073033	And the week from today, Wii Sports Resort with Motion Plus will be available as well.
4074314	4075395	So, that's a big one.
4075875	4076116	Fun.
4077250	4081053	Alright, well let's travel over to Japan and look at some of the Japanese release dates that are coming up.
4081733	4082193	Guess what?
4082233	4088498	On the Xbox 360, you can finally get the Japanese version of 50 Cent Blood on the Sand comes out in Japan this week.
4088598	4092660	So if you missed out on that gem, you can finally pick that up over there.
4092961	4094982	Bethesda is localizing that, I guess, for Japan.
4095422	4096523	50 yen, blood on the sand
4122202	4127986	Toro to Morimori Toro continues to chase his dream to become a human after he left the player.
4128186	4133989	One day, Kuro tells the white cat about the memory record, which can grant any wish after you fill it with gratitude.
4134009	4134850	So off Toro goes to help people.
4149739	4153520	So that's a game that you can check out, I guess, if you want, on the PlayStation 3.
4153580	4155301	That's a very, very Japanese game.
4155401	4156401	It looks kind of cute.
4156441	4157801	I'm trying to figure out what kind of game it is.
4157862	4159402	It looks very kind of adventure-like.
4159422	4163023	You know, I always thought that cat looked like he was straight out of Animal Crossing.
4164784	4169305	Hey, the game... It wasn't that cat based off of doing emoticons and ASCII art?
4169465	4169985	It could be.
4170345	4170905	It looks like it.
4170925	4172626	Yeah, I think it's the cat that was done off of that.
4173866	4175727	Hey, it comes with a clock for the PSP as well.
4176886	4177807	I have to have that.
4177947	4179328	I love stuff that comes with stuff.
4180249	4181029	Exactly right.
4182030	4183011	Inside stuff.
4184292	4192518	Actually, you know that I bought that whole Cardcaptor Sakura Dreamcast thing because it came with a plate and a fork and a spoon and a pillowcase.
4193939	4196822	On the Nintendo Wii, Punch-Out gets its release in Japan this week.
4196902	4199184	I was actually surprised to hear that they didn't have it first.
4199584	4200385	That kind of surprised me.
4201186	4204288	But another game that they got that we don't got, Dragon Ball.
4205049	4207531	Tekken Ishii Daibouken comes out this week.
4208232	4209373	Tenkaichi Budouken?
4209533	4212616	Yes, if you're a big fan of Dragon Ball Z, there you go.
4213317	4214358	Your very own Wii game.
4215362	4216983	Enjoy that in Japan this week.
4217423	4218984	Moving on to the handhelds for a minute.
4219125	4220485	Actually, going back to PlayStation 2.
4222567	4224748	Some games get a price reduction this week.
4224788	4228851	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Musou Orochi get price reductions this week.
4229792	4231473	Moving on, though, to the handhelds.
4231933	4234855	On the Nintendo DS, just some accessories.
4234915	4238197	If you like Disney characters, Mickey, Minnie, and Stitch, just some accessories.
4238778	4244842	But there's a new game coming out called Caticule Hitman Reborn DS Flame Rumble X.
4245522	4247765	It's a fighting game on the DS if you want to check that out.
4248305	4257335	Lastly, on the PSP, as I scroll on my list here to get to the PSP, just some price reductions.
4257415	4263481	Again, Katekyo Hitman Reborn Battle Arena gets a price reduction, and Musou Orochi also gets a price reduction.
4263601	4264402	So, enjoy!
4265704	4267065	There you go, your Japanese release dates.
4267085	4267886	Let's move over to Europe.
4268800	4272603	Well, it's actually, again, kind of a slow week like last week was.
4272683	4276487	On the 22nd, we have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time, Reshelled.
4277027	4277427	Yay!
4278348	4282612	Because that is one of my favorite turtle games ever.
4282752	4287336	Shatter on the 23rd for PS3 and on the Wii Sports Resort.
4287836	4288997	Try saying that three times fast.
4290799	4291099	That's it.
4291600	4292260	Wii Sport Resort.
4292320	4292520	See?
4292560	4293761	It's tough.
4300289	4301289	So it's interesting.
4301330	4307154	There's a game that's been out already in Japan, Trash Panic, which is on the PlayStation Network.
4307474	4313359	They're getting a new version of that game, which is called 100 Yen Gomibaku.
4314120	4317963	And what that is, is it's actually a pay-to-play game.
4319448	4320048	PSN Game
4338220	4345081	If you complete one of the two modes in that game, it unlocks a bonus in the full version of the game.
4346201	4355363	Steel mode will open up the same mode in the original game, and clearing normal mode will also open up five home rewards.
4356303	4361004	And it's kind of interesting that they're putting out a game that you have to continue to pay to play.
4362924	4363244	I don't know.
4363444	4364044	I wouldn't buy it.
4366605	4366965	Why not?
4367659	4368320	Thanks for watching!
4385166	4385766	I suppose.
4386106	4402950	You know, on Xbox Live Arcade, wouldn't the consumer really like to see, especially with some of these retro arcade releases that you pay $5 for and then play twice, wouldn't it be better to have a token type system where you just pay a quarter to play it once and then see if you want to play it again from there?
4403030	4405411	And if you like it a lot, then you can just buy it.
4405731	4407731	No, because that's what the demos are for.
4408012	4408872	And the demos are free.
4409152	4413913	So why the hell would I pay even a dollar for a game that I can demo for free
4414363	4415624	and realize if I want it or not.
4415884	4416365	And you know what?
4416485	4426473	It's my own damn fault if I buy a game that I think I'm going to like and I play it a few times and then just leave it to rot in my game collection as I have before with Doom.
4427322	4441847	and Duke Nukem 3D and Worms and Pac-Man and Dig Dug and all those other goddamn Namco games and other weird obscure Xbox Live Arcade games that I buy because they're cool and then I stop playing them.
4442547	4443907	So, you know what?
4444288	4444668	Too bad.
4445348	4451510	But hey, if you want to throw away your money like that, I'm sure that Sony will be willing to take it.
4453500	4455643	Sony doesn't release demos for all of their games either.
4455663	4458186	Would you feel differently if you didn't have the demos to go off of?
4458727	4463012	Yeah, I would feel differently because that would make me feel like they're trying to rip me off.
4464394	4465455	And I don't like being ripped off.
4465655	4466797	And they have a demo for this game.
4468888	4470549	I don't know, I'm a little bit iffy on it.
4470689	4473311	I think in some ways, you know, demos can be very limiting sometimes.
4473371	4476413	I mean, some of those demos in Xbox Live Marketplace, you play one screen and you're done.
4476814	4483218	Like, I would like a feature where I can play like a couple times to try to get the achievements, but once I've paid out like a dollar, I don't want to try anymore.
4483618	4495927	You know, I think it would be kind of cool to have a game that kind of rewards you, you know, that I can kind of pay as you go instead of dropping five, ten dollars on it, and then, you know, I realize this isn't Xbox Live, but I'm making that comparison anyway, whatever.
4496327	4497408	Yaris should pay me.
4498797	4521330	or that, who knows Yara should pay everybody and apologize for its existence no seriously they should pay the consumer because it's an ad and a horrible game mainly the horrible game is why they should have to pay out to everybody BlackWolfInChat says I would say about 90% of my DVD based game collection I don't play anymore either would you consider that a waste of money too?
4523251	4527954	no because you don't play it anymore you did play it at a time you don't just buy stuff and not play it
4529213	4530134	and who cares?
4531075	4532916	I've had those games I've played like once.
4533277	4535719	Okay, Fusion Frenzy 2, case in point.
4535759	4538361	I still have a wrapped version of Galarian's Ash.
4538801	4539122	Wow.
4539902	4543686	Played Fusion Frenzy 2 once, said to myself, the fuck was I thinking?
4544246	4545207	And never played it again.
4545387	4546308	Yeah, I could have told you that.
4547495	4547815	Whatever.
4547835	4550697	And I wanted to play through Galarian's Ash because you made people's heads explode.
4550898	4551778	Well, then you should have played it.
4551958	4552679	Well, maybe I will.
4552699	4553199	I still have it.
4554380	4555161	And I have an old PS2.
4555201	4556782	You can always go back someday.
4556882	4557402	I guess that's a thing.
4557422	4559164	I actually have an old PS3, so it'll play it.
4559444	4569071	I mean, seriously, nowadays with the internet and everything, I mean, hell, even back in the days where it was just gaming magazines, I mean, you're not completely oblivious to whether a game is good or not.
4569111	4570912	You have, you know, sites reviewing them.
4570952	4573094	You have, you know, friends that have played them.
4573214	4574755	You can try demos.
4574895	4575176	You can...
4575876	4601478	you know hear the buzz about it it's just you know I don't think this pricing model unless you're just going to you know put out these games and have no ability to buy them you just you know pay 25 cents or whatever a pop and but even then it's just you know arcade games are meant to take your quarters I know that and you know what I'm not going to play a PC game that's meant to take my quarters that's like playing an Indian casino I mean that's just gonna take my money
4602329	4608473	Bobby goes on in chat, Bobby Blackwolf says, but it's a waste of money to buy an XBLA game that you only played a few times and then not anymore.
4608833	4610154	Sounds like a double standard, just saying.
4610715	4615037	Yeah, it is a waste of money to buy an Xbox Live arcade game that you're going to play a couple times.
4615397	4616278	But you know what, though?
4616438	4619660	I mean, if you think that you got your money's worth out of it, then that's fine.
4619920	4627105	But let's take, for example, if you were to play the arcade version of, say, Contra or...
4627927	4629749	DarkSakura.com
4646084	4646564	Thank you for watching!
4662199	4663120	BlackWolf goes on.
4663560	4667023	I want to move on topics, but I'll read this other little debate here.
4667404	4670907	Okay, so XBLA game that you play a couple of times equals waste of money.
4671227	4677112	DVD based game that you paid probably six times as much and only play a couple of times equals not a waste of money.
4679234	4680275	No, it's still a waste of money.
4682327	4688590	I think though, sometimes you go into these games and you look back and you go, wow, I really wasted my money.
4688770	4690250	That's how I feel about BitBoy.
4690750	4694392	I paid six bucks for that game and I'm like, you know what, this game, that was a waste of money.
4694412	4695632	Or like Left 4 Dead for me.
4696012	4703595	I bought the game and I consider it a waste of money because I don't have time to play it and I just don't really want to play it right now.
4703735	4708658	But, you know, that's just the risk of entertainment sometimes is that you're not always going to be entertained.
4708958	4716702	For instance, I've gone to a play that I spent 30, 40 bucks on tickets for and was not entertained and was like, well, that was a waste of money.
4717422	4720724	By the way, it was the Jesus Christ Superstar production here in Sacramento.
4720744	4721745	It was terrible years ago.
4722445	4723526	Let's see, what else was it?
4724186	4725186	Movies, all the time.
4725406	4726647	Oh my god, there's so many movies.
4726687	4729328	You pay $10 to go see the movie and then you're like, wow, that was a waste of my time.
4729888	4732009	Especially when movies cost as much as they do.
4732350	4736231	That's really tough when you pay that much to see a movie and then it sucks.
4737012	4738712	And then add the food cost into that as well.
4738732	4739993	That can be quite an investment.
4740233	4745015	And I even think you get more of a value out of a video game than you do in a movie.
4745075	4751358	Now I knew you were going to say that because, oh, an Xbox Live arcade game, you get X number of hours of entertainment out of it.
4751658	4752038	DarkSakura.com
4770311	4775994	And with a movie, if you really, really don't like it, you could probably go back to the front counter and get your money back.
4776114	4777034	You'd be surprised.
4777074	4782057	I've gone to movies where I let friends or significant others pick the movie, and I didn't like it.
4782357	4789441	Well, that's your fault for trusting someone else's judgment and letting them steer the vehicle, I guess.
4789941	4794103	But that's like letting my wife pick a movie or something like that sometimes.
4795055	4822445	and here's the thing is though is that some movies yes you can get more of a value out of like DVDs you know there's some DVDs like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion or Clue I've easily watched those DVDs or Rocky Horror Picture Show shit I've watched those DVDs easily 20 times each you know I would definitely say I got my money's worth out of those just like some video games I probably only spend a little bit of money on like the original Geometry Wars $5 oh my god I spent so much time on that game right or Super Mario Kart back on the old Super Nintendo
4822985	4823385	Thanks for watching!
4843955	4844295	Risk.
4844415	4848017	When you look at it, it's good for them to try different price models.
4848297	4851519	It's bad if they're going to try to force you into those other price models.
4852939	4859302	Opening options is a good idea, but forcing you down really ridiculous options, that's another thing.
4859882	4868606	The way I see this game is more of a bonus game that you can play to unlock other stuff in the other game.
4868966	4872588	It's kind of like an add-on that you're just paid to play.
4874958	4878382	All right, well, let's move on past this topic.
4879123	4882547	I think there's a lot more to be seen on this topic.
4882587	4884870	It really depends on how some of these other games do.
4885871	4889775	It's going to be interesting to see the precedent that some of these things might set.
4890436	4892296	Anyhow, let's move on to another story.
4892336	4898158	And speaking of places you might go to buy games, Microsoft apparently is going to be launching retail stores this fall.
4898198	4898658	That's right.
4898998	4900218	I have the Apple Store in the mall.
4900538	4901158	Guess what's coming?
4901198	4902239	The Microsoft Store.
4902519	4904779	Apparently the first stores are going to be launching this fall.
4905359	4907460	I haven't heard where yet, but I guess they're coming.
4908480	4912161	And I don't know if that means you can actually take your Xbox 360 in there and get it repaired.
4912521	4913761	That would be kind of cool though, wouldn't it?
4914341	4915421	Ambitious though, don't you think?
4915521	4918122	No, I doubt it that you would be able to repair it at the store.
4918282	4922023	But they are opening up storefronts and just in time for Windows 7, right?
4923183	4923403	Yeah.
4924324	4932426	So I guess, let's see, this was confirmed at the Worldwide Partner Conference in New Orleans by the Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Turner.
4933306	4936126	But they haven't, I still don't see where the first store is going to be.
4936507	4938007	I bet you though one of them is in Seattle.
4939698	4940639	That's probably a gimme.
4941039	4944300	Probably Seattle, San Francisco, New York, LA.
4944860	4945801	You know, major cities.
4946021	4947261	Well, competition's healthy, right?
4948162	4948602	Exactly.
4948642	4949622	By the way, something else to note.
4949662	4957066	Microsoft had actually hired a former Walmart executive, David Porter, and he's going to be the corporate vice president of these retail stores.
4957106	4958766	That move was made back in February.
4959147	4960967	So you've kind of seen this coming for a long time.
4961368	4962488	I think these stores could be interesting.
4962528	4963688	I think competition's healthy.
4964329	4966190	I think especially, you know, I...
4967430	4973936	As much as I do enjoy Apple and I like the iPhone and stuff, I do think some of their shit is obscenely priced.
4974356	4982663	And when you get out there in the mall, a laptop that's $400, like the one that I bought at Fry's, although sadly in a Microsoft store at the mall, they're probably not going to go that cheap.
4982683	4988689	When you get these really cheap laptops next to the Apple laptops, it's going to really drive competition, I think, a little bit.
4989269	4989770	Just a little.
4990030	4991851	I've been in Apple stores a few times.
4992032	4992192	Mm-hmm.
4993223	4994323	My god, and you didn't melt?
4994343	4995884	Yeah, I almost did.
4996604	4997424	Short exposures.
4998524	4999904	But I hated being in them.
5000125	5001465	They're blinding.
5002105	5008006	I hated being in them because it reminded me of the whole gateway PC stores that they used to have.
5008266	5012367	Basically, you go in and you have to make an appointment to be helped.
5012907	5014208	I'm sorry, that's crap.
5014248	5015308	Because they're so popular.
5016288	5020472	They have to do that I do If the food's really good, I do
5038516	5044641	Okay, well, if they dress the food up really nice, but the food is actually really inferior to cheaper food... Then no, I wouldn't go back to that restaurant.
5044661	5045181	Okay, good.
5045921	5046882	Glad you see things my way.
5049019	5050940	Anyhow, but this is an opinion, not a fact.
5051400	5053161	But anyway, you know what, though?
5053221	5065045	I think one thing that I do like about the stores, despite your complaint about them, I like the place that there's a place you can take your Apple into to get fixed up, that there's a place where they have these classes that show off how to use the Apple hardware and software.
5065365	5073248	I think it's kind of neat that it ends up being like a centralized place for Apple, despite the fact that the stores might charge a little more than you might find if you would just shop around.
5073268	5074289	And the fact that they blind you...
5075129	5076049	It's not a bad concept.
5076069	5077089	They really do blind you.
5077189	5079230	Wait, why would you need classes to use an Apple?
5079630	5081650	I mean, I thought it was supposed to be user-friendly.
5081710	5082990	I'm talking about, like, not me.
5083050	5084031	I'm talking about older people.
5084611	5086171	Or some of the software that they put out for it.
5086211	5090852	Like, maybe you've always wanted to use GarageBand, but you're just not sure how to begin, and it's not like you're going to read the manual.
5091092	5092892	I think it's kind of cool that you could take a class on that.
5093232	5093752	You know what?
5094093	5100734	If we're going to make our Pots and Pans song, we're going to need an audio maker to do it, so we might have to use GarageBand, Loki.
5101174	5101734	No, we're not.
5102347	5103968	Adobe makes a really good program already.
5104128	5105049	Fine, fine, fine.
5105849	5106850	I don't know how to use it though.
5106870	5107850	I love Creative Suite 4.
5107911	5110212	I'll have to take a class on it because I don't know how to use it.
5110292	5111993	I know how to use Adobe Audition.
5112033	5112373	That's it.
5112874	5116976	Well, yeah, but this is the program that they replaced Audition with and it works just the same.
5117436	5117877	Oh, interesting.
5118037	5118197	Yeah.
5118317	5121439	Well, we use it to tape our podcast, but that's it.
5122339	5122560	Anyway.
5123480	5123780	All right.
5123820	5126182	So I'm curious to see what happens with these retail stores.
5126302	5128603	I will definitely check them out when they're available.
5128863	5130484	All this new stuff is getting on my nerves.
5130905	5131285	Why is that?
5133474	5135555	My poor brain is living in a cave.
5135575	5140697	I think in this economy, though, it's nice to hear about stores opening up as opposed to stores closing.
5141117	5143879	I sort of have a feeling that it's not going to last.
5143979	5144899	And you know what, though?
5145419	5149642	A Microsoft store going into a mall, that's one less spot that they can put a Hot Topic.
5151623	5153143	They can only have one Hot Topic per mall.
5153163	5153483	Or a Cinnabon.
5153503	5154304	They're never going to have...
5155509	5156790	Hey, I like Cinnabon.
5156830	5157531	That's delicious.
5157571	5161835	Did you know, by the way, at Walmart this week, I was actually at Walmart and I was looking at candles.
5162255	5164036	They have candles that smell like Cinnabon.
5164096	5167099	That's just a horrible cock tease right there.
5167459	5169161	It needs to be real Cinnabon.
5169321	5171543	But you can get the Cinnabon or like the Snickerdoodles.
5171903	5173365	Oh, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
5173445	5177969	Actually, at Cracker Barrel, the last time I was... Which we don't have here.
5178969	5179090	But...
5179910	5187534	They had a cinnamon monkey bread scented one, which is like super delicious.
5187574	5188715	Monkey bread's hecka good.
5189135	5190255	You can get that at the grocery store.
5190355	5191216	Anyway, sorry, food.
5191316	5192116	Orange Lounge Foodio.
5192497	5194518	Let's move into the classic game of the week.
5194558	5201601	It's the part of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane and DarkSakura picks a game that she thinks, you know what, you guys should all be playing this game.
5201641	5202982	Why the hell are you not playing this game?
5203382	5203923	God, really?
5204003	5210932	It's the classic game of the week, and I believe tonight, in a little bit of a twist, it's the classic games of the week, correct?
5211232	5211472	Yes.
5212133	5215838	Alright, so DarkSakura, tell us what games we ought to be playing this week.
5217028	5223833	Well, it really is specifically to one game, but I have to mention the rest of the series.
5224533	5228236	So I'm starting it off with Crush Pinball.
5228696	5235460	It actually all starts with Alien Crush, which still is probably the better of all of that series.
5237902	5240644	Sorry, there's a little bit of background noise in this particular movie file.
5250715	5251815	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5277722	5283430	And you can also play two different music tracks and you have a fastball or a slowball.
5283790	5285072	Really, it's very simple.
5286153	5287876	The sequel to this was Devil's Crush.
5287936	5288817	It's like pinball.
5289458	5290219	It is pinball.
5290279	5293864	It's just a, you know, video pinball.
5294204	5294785	It's the joke.
5295065	5295925	Yeah, yeah, really.
5296366	5306453	This one is Devil's Crush, or as it was in Japan, Devil Crash, was the next in the series.
5306633	5311377	It had an occult theme, it had demons and skeletons and everything.
5311817	5315340	It also is on Virtual Console, as is...
5317901	5321123	Yeah, as is Alien Crush is also on Virtual Console.
5322923	5325765	The Mega Drive version was called Dragon's Fury.
5326705	5328926	And that did get a release.
5329006	5330247	And it had a sequel.
5330447	5331667	I'm playing some Devil's Crush right now.
5333628	5333949	Okay.
5334189	5339251	The Mega Drive sequel was Dragon's Revenge, which actually we just found out our cart died.
5339951	5341192	So we have to find another one of it.
5342012	5343253	I thought this one had some cool music.
5346354	5346854	Devil Crush.
5347395	5350997	And then there was one that we never got in America that I have actually played.
5351238	5353920	I have played it at somebody's house.
5354380	5356842	I do not remember when or who, but I know I have played it.
5357482	5359424	And it's called Jockey Crush.
5360285	5361105	J-A-K-I.
5361966	5363887	And it came out on the Super Famicom in 1992.
5364628	5364708	And...
5367811	5371274	This one has very Super Nintendo music.
5371334	5383525	Listen to a little.
5384906	5387128	It's probably too violent for Nintendo standards.
5387228	5389390	It does have that kind of demon-y sort of look.
5389827	5398996	Well, in the background of the stage, there's actually a type of ogre called a jockey.
5399657	5404061	So it really is very heavy on the demon theme with this one.
5404582	5406224	But it's really fun.
5406364	5408966	I actually really remember liking this game a lot.
5409967	5430926	and um it's a little on the difficult side from what I remember but now after that now also by the way I did go looking for this on eBay and it was 54 bucks which I considered um after that though we got a WiiWare version Alien Crush Returns and that one is uh
5432167	5435168	It's me trying not to make noises at the microphone.
5437229	5445351	But it's a somewhat sequel remake to Alien Crush, and it is considered definitely part of the Crush series.
5446471	5454893	You use the Wiimote with this one, and so you can tilt the table, and you have action balls, which just makes me laugh, all kinds of stuff.
5455453	5460695	And you have a six-stage story mode and boss battles and online multiplayer and leaderboards, so...
5461515	5462596	It's pretty neat.
5463537	5464737	This game's kind of freaky.
5465738	5467779	Yeah, that one's actually really cool.
5470661	5481808	Actually, we might want to link the chatroom on this particular video, because this is actually, I think, one of the graphically better Super Nintendo titles.
5482709	5488953	You see how the... I really think it's a fantastic, fantastic game.
5489553	5490634	I just linked it there in chat, by the way.
5491901	5517237	but there's there's it really had a lot to do and it's fairly difficult as I recall I've only played it like twice but I do remember playing it all right so yeah it's definitely all about crush pinball and you really people with a Wii you have no excuse not to you know unless you're like dirt poor then why do you have a Wii um but Alien Crush and Devil's Crush you can get on um the Wii you can get um
5518840	5522181	The remake Alien Crush returns on WiiWare.
5522922	5525903	Jackie Crush emulator.
5526923	5529384	I really have no problem saying get a SNES emulator and play it.
5529444	5530585	It's really worthwhile playing.
5531405	5535047	And then, of course, there's all the Mega Drive versions.
5535067	5538668	So really, there's multiple ways to play any of the games in the series.
5538728	5539348	I say go for it.
5540929	5541269	Alright.
5541509	5543050	And I'm sure Extrofer will agree.
5543581	5543821	Yes.
5544542	5545183	There you have it, guys.
5545223	5547407	He played a lot.
5547447	5549570	Every day I came home from work, he was playing Alien Crush.
5549590	5552594	Not even the remake, the old school TurboGrafx one when I downloaded it on the Wii.
5553255	5553896	There you have it, guys.
5553916	5557281	Your classic game of the week is the Crush series, starting off with Alien Crush.
5558503	5558844	Enjoy.
5560399	5560839	or don't.
5560919	5561500	See if we care.
5562180	5571007	Alright, we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break with some rapid fire news and some more discussion including our independent developers being shut out of Xbox Live Arcade.
5571567	5573909	Make way for the Avatar Premium clothing.
5573929	5577671	We're going to be talking about some of those changes to Xbox Live when we come back from a quick break.
5578112	5579973	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5585404	5585844	Thanks for watching!
5604515	5605816	9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.
5606296	5614660	We talked a lot about some of the other gaming news going on in the world in our last section, including news about the Conduit being easy and not selling much.
5615521	5616441	Being easy to hack, that is.
5617202	5627127	Talked about the Rock Band Network, talked about Microsoft retail stores, and now we're going to talk about some rapid-fire news so quickly, some stories that we're not going to spend a whole lot of time on but want to get out there anyway.
5627611	5636815	Alright, Fallout 3 PlayStation download content didn't quite come out during June, but now will be coming out by the end of September.
5637275	5643717	This was an announcement from the PlayStation blog saying that, of course, the content is releasing later than originally expected.
5644198	5654302	To make up for it, they're going to have the first two download packs will be Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta, which is the brand new actually the last, I think, download content coming to Fallout 3.
5655602	5659646	Also, something else coming to the PlayStation Network would be PC Engine games.
5659726	5662669	Yes, they're kind of pulling a little bit of a virtual console there.
5663430	5671358	Sony has announced that four PC Engine or TurboGrafx-16 titles will be coming to the store actually last week.
5671878	5678244	And this would include Bomberman 94, New Adventure Island, Sengoku Mahjong, and Devil's Crush, each for 600 yen.
5681565	5688327	And then finally, Sony has trademarked AdHawk Party in the US.
5688967	5696569	And AdHawk Party was a service originally only available in Japan, and basically it would allow PSP owners to play AdHawk games over the internet.
5696709	5701071	Usually AdHawk games, of course, obviously only can play with people in your same room.
5701611	5704692	But now you'll be able to play with your friends over the internet, which is pretty awesome.
5705392	5705972	Because, uh...
5707666	5713109	We used to get it on with the ad hoc gaming with the PSP Grand Theft Auto titles.
5713189	5713969	That's kind of cool.
5714029	5717771	So any PSP title that has ad hoc play you'll now be able to do on the internet?
5717851	5718051	Yes.
5718191	5718972	That's actually kind of good.
5719032	5720673	That's really good for the PSP.
5720993	5721153	Yeah.
5721273	5721673	That's cool.
5721693	5724074	But you'd have to have your PlayStation 3 on while you do it or something?
5724154	5724355	Yes.
5724755	5725215	That's cool.
5725955	5726536	I like that idea.
5727316	5732319	Alright, well, let's go through some more rapid-fire news, including for our music game fans.
5732359	5734200	I'm sure you're still following Beatmania 2DX.
5734260	5737582	Well, Beatmania 2DX Empress is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.
5737903	5740484	Keep in mind, it is a Japanese series only.
5740524	5741725	They don't come out here in America.
5742085	5744327	A lot of our hardcore music game fans, they import them.
5744347	5748189	But the important news about this, it is the last Beatmania coming to the PlayStation 2.
5748609	5750891	And honestly, I'm surprised it is coming to the PlayStation 2.
5751499	5752680	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5774797	5779001	By the way, it should be noted, though, this isn't the last game that's coming out in arcades.
5779321	5788610	Beatmania 2DX 17 Serious, like the satellite radio, not why so serious, but Beatmania 2DX 17 Serious has actually been location testing.
5788630	5789671	You mean like the dog star?
5789851	5793494	Yes, that's really where it gets its name from, but probably most people know it as satellite radio.
5793514	5797438	And not for like, seriously, they're releasing a 17th version of this game?
5797698	5797738	No.
5798226	5801270	Well, it's interesting though, I hadn't heard of any hardware upgrades.
5801310	5803993	So if this series is coming out to PlayStation 3, I don't know.
5804434	5805555	Or what's going to happen in the future.
5805635	5809580	But anyhow, Beat Media 2DX 16 Empress and Premium Best is going to set you back 7,980 yen.
5809600	5810561	That's 86 bucks on October 15th in Japan.
5810581	5812623	So plan on paying about $99 to import it over here probably.
5817469	5820070	Marvel vs. Capcom is going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.
5820110	5822031	The date was a little bit of a mystery, but now we know.
5822171	5825792	August 13th and $15 is how much it's going to set you back on the PlayStation 3.
5825832	5830194	That's a full two weeks, by the way, after the Xbox Live Arcade version.
5831314	5831554	Sad.
5832455	5836977	By the way, this is also going to be the same date that a retail version of the game comes out.
5837017	5837357	It's $5 more.
5838297	5839418	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5856696	5859037	Hey, some rewards if you're a Nintendo member.
5859177	5863099	Finally, we were waiting for some of this stuff from Japan, but now there's some good stuff coming out over here.
5863479	5869261	If you're a Platinum member, you can actually get a downloadable version of Punch-Out called Doc Lewis' Punch-Out.
5869701	5871142	Yes, you want to fight your trainer?
5873470	5874230	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5897121	5899763	What you have to do to qualify for each one.
5899803	5901344	I imagine it just depends on your purchases.
5901404	5904046	It's just how many coins you get from that.
5904166	5907908	You know, I was registering all my Nintendo purchases on Nintendo.com a while ago.
5907928	5918514	It requires you also to register your purchases, to review the games that you've done, answer little surveys, and then add other surveys available that you could do.
5918735	5919255	Interesting.
5919295	5920436	Well, hey, free game.
5920916	5921676	Not going to complain.
5922077	5923938	I wonder if you have to own the original Punch-Out too.
5923978	5925079	No, it's a WiiWare game.
5925119	5925459	Cool.
5926417	5929305	So maybe I'll check that out, because I never did buy Punch-Out on the Wii, although maybe I ought to.
5930007	5930268	I don't know.
5931512	5932173	Well, there you go.
5932234	5934279	Some rapid-fire news from me, Jamie.
5934921	5949996	Well there's a Swedish group called Opeth that said on their website that they basically said that there's going to be a PSP version of Saints Row because their music is being featured in it.
5950817	5954600	They're quoted as saying expect it to hit streets around March 2010.
5954660	5957203	THQ hasn't said anything about this.
5957639	5958260	I'm not surprised.
5958280	5963264	They were working on a PSP version of the game, I think, since back to the original Saints Row.
5963764	5967127	Maybe even Saints Row 2, but I know that was coming, so that's awesome.
5968909	5971291	Well, guess what's coming back?
5972031	5972772	Where's Waldo?
5973433	5974714	Oh, I was hoping it was Pet Rocks.
5976274	5976634	No.
5978756	5980497	There is actually Where's Waldo?
5980517	5981638	The Fantastic Journey.
5981718	5986602	So you look for Waldo and his buddies and stuff like it in the books.
5987123	5992527	And it has four multiplayer mode power-ups.
5994008	5999132	So you can actually hide what you're looking for from the other people and different things.
5999193	6001614	And it's in development for PC, Mac, Wii, and DS.
6002095	6003236	Will you get to find Wilma too?
6005465	6006046	Yes, probably.
6006146	6007708	I think you can find a bunch of different things.
6008049	6012335	I've actually seen screenshots for it and it's exactly what you would think.
6013096	6013717	Where's Waldo?
6013777	6014939	But a digital version of it.
6015059	6015600	You know what's funny?
6015640	6018524	I actually played this game and I'm still looking for a good game.
6019753	6021374	It's supposed to be coming out in September.
6022674	6029197	Also, for some news on Dragon Quest IX, the rumor is that there's going to be some downloadable content.
6030878	6042303	It was actually hinted about from a rumor from NeoGAF that said that it was supposed to be involved in that and that it was going to be big, but...
6043686	6043926	Oh well.
6045707	6051368	You know what's funny is I would definitely think Where's Waldo is going to be the game of September.
6051908	6055849	Screw Beatles, Rock Band, Guitar Hero 5, Halo 3 ODST.
6055909	6058790	I'm so glad they're making a sequel to the Where's Waldo that was on the Super Nintendo.
6058810	6059970	I don't know if you ever played this game.
6060410	6061390	Fucking garbage.
6061551	6063371	It is the most garbage.
6064011	6067312	Actually, I've played games that were less fun than Where's Waldo, Yaris being one of them.
6067632	6069973	But there are games that are really bad.
6070253	6070793	Where's Waldo
6071713	6074835	Whatever happened to the good adver games?
6076576	6077716	There were good adver games?
6077736	6078437	Yes, there was.
6078937	6079417	Cool Spot.
6079437	6080218	Remember Cool Spot?
6080258	6081178	Okay, Cool Spot.
6081218	6082319	That was an awesome game.
6083059	6084340	You Annoyed was okay.
6084760	6085421	It was a little weird.
6085441	6087082	Didn't they make a game out of McDonald's?
6087162	6088563	McKids was a game?
6088583	6089963	I don't remember that one.
6090003	6091224	There was a McDonald's game.
6091384	6092225	Oh, no, yeah, you said that.
6092625	6096767	There was a game for... What else was there?
6096847	6097147	There was...
6098678	6098878	Exactly.
6098958	6099118	Oh, well.
6126590	6128571	So, oh well, let's move on with some more news.
6129211	6131412	Less advert gaming and more news.
6131632	6134574	Yes, let's talk about buying stuff.
6135114	6142918	And, you know, Microsoft, we kind of knew this was coming with the whole premium content for avatars.
6142938	6144499	The Cheetos game, thank you.
6145359	6146319	It was a Cheetos game.
6147060	6147340	Really?
6147460	6148821	Sorry, yep.
6148841	6150662	There was a Chester the Cheetah game.
6150962	6153423	It was absolute trash, but it was out there.
6154093	6154674	Thanks for watching!
6171377	6199635	including one that they are showing a screenshot for which reveals a steampunk collection and they have different items you can buy for like $2 each and this one made me kind of giggle a little bit it's a steampunk brown jacket and bust and it's funny because she's busty so you know I'm assuming that they're talking about Bustier but I'm just going to leave it at bust so you're actually buying breasts in this as well and that's awesome um
6200987	6207369	So yeah, or as Destructoid calls it, Microsoft Moon Dollars.
6207589	6208949	I love that.
6208969	6210450	160 Microsoft Moon Dollars.
6211170	6213671	I think that's a joke because they're not really worth anything, you know?
6213751	6214511	I know, I know.
6214631	6218412	You just pay them to the evil empire and then hope that they release something you want.
6218973	6222054	Yeah, so basically you're buying more virtual clothing.
6222235	6224135	And it's neat, I guess.
6224436	6228257	I mean, after all, I am a person that bought clothing in-home.
6228798	6232499	But to be fair, I'm wearing that clothing forever now.
6233040	6234520	I will be forever Santa Claus.
6234720	6237802	So that's the way things go.
6238442	6239963	Oh, Loki, you're forever Santa Claus.
6239983	6240443	That's cute.
6242104	6246006	By the way, I just wanted to say in chat, hey, you could do some advert clothes.
6246146	6246546	Why not?
6248072	6249934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6260652	6262214	I know, they do need to do more of those.
6262414	6263776	I think those are really popular too.
6264777	6265658	Actually, I think they were.
6266258	6269642	Weren't they selling at GameStop for more than the $5 they cost originally?
6269882	6270062	No.
6270863	6271384	I thought they did.
6271624	6273046	No, they're not worth anything now.
6273066	6275789	In fact, I just sold some of them back because I wasn't playing them.
6275809	6276269	Did you really?
6276570	6279393	Yeah, I have one left that I forgot to sell back.
6280171	6282792	I bought all three, and I played them, and I was like, wow, these suck.
6283333	6285694	So what do you think about paying for clothes on Xbox Live?
6286034	6286734	I probably won't do it.
6286914	6294118	The only thing that's kind of interesting about this, it's not even necessarily, this is basically the reward clothing that you get for certain achievements.
6294438	6294959	That's cool.
6295359	6296279	Yeah, I like that idea.
6296399	6297700	This I'm not even interested in.
6298260	6306324	Honestly, I have never changed, you know, maybe a couple times changed clothes on my avatar, but I'm kind of happy with what they are now.
6306504	6307405	I don't really give a shit.
6308426	6312648	I tried to go in there and update my avatar, and I didn't really see a lot of new stuff that I wanted to wear.
6312668	6317792	A lot of it's really out there, and I like my avatar to kind of look like me, although it really looks nothing like me.
6318292	6320153	I try to make it at least kind of close.
6320193	6322375	DarkSakura looks a lot like her, actually.
6322415	6323175	It's kind of freaky.
6324156	6324836	Dan looks like him.
6325137	6326497	Loki's doesn't really look like him, either.
6327838	6329159	It's as close as I could get.
6329299	6332982	It makes it look like you have a lot more facial hair than you actually do.
6333602	6333882	Yeah.
6333902	6335123	I think that's the weird thing about it.
6335343	6336124	It kind of looks like it.
6336144	6336664	It's darker.
6336705	6337805	There's no in-between.
6337825	6338806	Yeah, that's true.
6338826	6339547	That's the problem with it.
6340968	6341909	Anyhow, yeah.
6343089	6345751	I'm cool with the reward clothes, but I wouldn't pay money for clothes.
6345792	6347873	I mean, what do you really use the avatars for?
6348474	6348774	Nothing.
6348974	6352677	On your card, your gamer card, maybe you see it in 1 versus 100.
6352837	6354498	I mean, it's not that big a deal.
6354999	6358621	I guess there's some games, a few games that use them, but not really.
6358882	6359522	And who cares?
6359742	6363105	No one's going to go, oh my god, your avatar is poorly dressed.
6364008	6367429	Now, SSJ100Matt says, Rangers jersey, please.
6367869	6369090	That's actually kind of a good point.
6369150	6371211	What about these, like, sports jersey tie-ins?
6371251	6373812	That might be kind of cool, like, to wear your favorite team.
6374112	6376513	Just like a lot of people actually do wear that stuff, right?
6377193	6377893	Well, good for them.
6379074	6379894	But I'm not buying it.
6381174	6382135	The steampunk clothing?
6382635	6384556	I'm sorry, my character does not need a bust.
6386496	6387557	No bust for my character.
6388843	6390684	No bust for you.
6391505	6392485	Moving on to some more news.
6392525	6399729	Speaking of Xbox Live Arcade, apparently there's some mumbling going around that indie games are being closed out of Xbox Live Arcade.
6400050	6404472	This came from a report from Screenplay talking to some concerned developers.
6404812	6409495	Apparently Microsoft has been dramatically reducing the number of independent titles published on Xbox Live Arcade.
6410396	6417400	I guess the whole crackdown on independent games is a response to folks saying that there is just too much available on the service.
6417740	6425272	The major publishers are actually behind this saying that, well, you aren't giving enough attention to our major games because you're spending time promoting these indie games.
6426033	6433224	Indie developers also a little sad because they think there are two different sets of rules for publishers, one being for indies and one being for major publishers.
6433644	6436406	Microsoft has responded to the accusations.
6436546	6438467	It took them a little while, but they did respond and say,
6454537	6454977	Thanks for watching!
6475023	6490921	and honestly I see the point where they're kind of being shut up but at the same time if they market themselves right they could actually release a game through community games and it could be the same quality I mean there's some really good games on there the problem is there's a lot of really crappy games on there as well and it kind of gets buried in all that
6491341	6498726	But as we mentioned, Part A, now you can link to your downloads and stuff like that and your blogs.
6499046	6505049	I mean, there's a lot of ways they can market themselves, but I think they want Microsoft to kind of do the marketing for them.
6505370	6510873	And maybe they should if Microsoft's getting so much money from it.
6510953	6515456	But at the same time, it's not like they're completely being blocked out of it.
6515916	6518958	Just because it's not an Xbox Live Arcade doesn't mean it can't be up on their service.
6520097	6523319	You know, I do think Microsoft is a little bit in the right here.
6523579	6529964	Certainly they're doing more than Nintendo or Sony's doing, although it does seem Nintendo does get a lot of indie games on it.
6530464	6535248	I mean, yeah, they get a lot of indie games on it, but is Nintendo actually promoting those indie games?
6535348	6537769	It's really the indie games that are promoting themselves on there.
6537830	6538190	That's true.
6538290	6538850	That's very true.
6539411	6540632	How do you hear about any of those games?
6540652	6541032	You don't.
6541052	6541512	Through the blog.
6541752	6544935	Nintendo doesn't do a lot to sell those games, besides just put them on the marketplace.
6545175	6549198	Or send out the email, here's what's up on the virtual console WiiWare.
6549318	6549718	Big deal.
6551161	6552962	So I think to some extent, Microsoft's in the right there.
6552982	6562168	But at the same time, what about... I thought there were supposed to be the really big, great indie games would cross over into being full-blown Xbox Live arcade games.
6562228	6563008	Whatever happened to that?
6563749	6565810	Because you still can't get achievements out of indie games.
6566130	6566791	Some of them are.
6567031	6568912	I mean, like... What?
6569132	6569773	What's crossed over?
6570713	6574536	The Dishwasher, that one crossed over.
6574976	6575716	There was...
6577822	6581584	There's another one that was like winner of that GameCon thing.
6581824	6582344	I can't remember.
6582784	6584205	I know there's a couple that have crossed over.
6584225	6586126	Oh, The Age's Wing that was free?
6586686	6587406	Was that one?
6587547	6588207	No, not that one.
6588227	6589307	That was before XNA.
6589407	6590388	Yeah, that was something else.
6591008	6592049	There's some other ones that won.
6592409	6595530	But I know the community games, there's a few that actually get spotlighted.
6596491	6598732	Like Carnyvale Showtime or whatever.
6598752	6600793	Remember that one I was talking about a long time ago?
6601853	6603714	That's actually being shown off at PAX now.
6603854	6605155	There's a little indie games thing.
6605215	6605395	So...
6606115	6607356	I don't think they're promoted very well.
6607376	6607496	Yeah.
6630546	6634908	But, you know, they are doing, I think, more to promote them than other places.
6635408	6637449	I mean, I don't know if Sony is promoting them.
6637469	6639230	Well, hell, they don't really have that many indie games.
6639290	6645413	I mean, they do have some indie games on their PlayStation Network service, but it's not like you're getting a flood of games coming out from them.
6645453	6649195	It's like one or two a week, maybe, if you're getting a release every week.
6650083	6652685	Yeah, whereas there's hundreds of community games.
6671597	6675820	Well, maybe some of this should be developed as disc games or a step further.
6675900	6678281	But I guess at the same time, that's expensive.
6678681	6679522	How indie is that?
6680563	6684565	Why not do collections?
6684685	6685946	The monthly pick or something.
6686286	6686546	Could be.
6687987	6688948	Yeah, that's unfortunate.
6706621	6709102	And I guess in the next thing, X-Link says a vote system.
6709462	6713623	I guess that's what's coming in the next version of Xbox Live, the dashboard.
6713643	6719346	They've talked about that they're going to have voting on not only the community games, but the regular games too, which should be interesting.
6719426	6722247	Although, I don't know, I think those voting systems can be abused.
6723687	6726488	You know, if it's like Dig, it can be abused.
6726928	6730189	It's just who's the most popularist, right?
6730549	6730750	Yeah.
6731790	6731910	So...
6733733	6737338	Fear the Claw, though, says this, the point of being indie is to find mythical treasures.
6737398	6740001	The point of being indie is to get yourself out there.
6740802	6741723	Play on the word indie.
6742024	6745087	But I get what he's saying, is that getting yourself out there is a big part of it.
6746629	6748091	To be continued, I'm sure.
6748511	6750474	Anyhow, our show is to be continued, right, DarkSakura?
6750934	6751795	Oh, absolutely.
6751835	6754419	We do have a little bit more in the way of news.
6754479	6755900	Well, it's not really news.
6755960	6760346	It's something that we all knew and have been saying and they finally admitted.
6762168	6767434	Ryota Nitsuma, who is the assistant producer on the arcade version of Street Fighter IV...
6768375	6782618	said that there are two fighters who were disproportionately powerful and he actually, to quote him, says well first of all I might have to apologize, does he involve being slightly blinded and scarred?
6783078	6792860	And so actually he said that Seth and perhaps Sagat are two overpowered characters in the game but a skilled player can still beat them.
6793789	6795770	I wouldn't call them overpowered other than cheap.
6798192	6800594	Cheap I think goes with the overpowered thing.
6801515	6803076	It's more that they are...
6804648	6832218	I would say just for skill level that it would require a higher amount of skill level than it would to fight any of the other characters the final boss should be hard but I agree he's way too freaking hard Seth is a cheap ass mofo he's way too hard I think also the boss in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom oh my god cheap the fucking happy fun ball yeah I agree with that
6834389	6838451	End of the fight three times, which makes it three times as awesome.
6839171	6841152	Or frustrating, however you want to look at that.
6841232	6842933	Interesting, though, that they've come out and admit it.
6842973	6845434	Like, a lot of times people are like, no, my game is perfect.
6845494	6846174	Nothing's wrong with it.
6846414	6847315	Yeah, we got fucked up.
6848695	6848915	Dope.
6849316	6851276	Well, fix it, then.
6851977	6854038	Put out a patch for the home versions.
6854278	6856559	I mean, you've got some of them online.
6856619	6856939	Do it.
6857899	6859720	Ah, but that means you've got to do work.
6860000	6860621	No.
6861381	6862942	We've already sold a jillion copies.
6863002	6863722	Why should we bother?
6865697	6865957	Yes.
6867218	6867598	Anyways.
6867738	6875043	I have to quote DarkTetsuya saying that hopefully the Happy Fun Ball is toned down a bit for the US version.
6875063	6877345	And I do agree with SSG100.
6877585	6879106	Matt Gill is still a big bitch.
6882452	6883393	Alright, let's move on.
6884614	6890800	So, kind of interesting, there's now a rumor, or not really a rumor, I guess it's an internal memo.
6891581	6898307	Canadian retailer Zellers has put out a memo, apparently, internally in their store chain.
6898787	6902728	That they're going to be no longer stocking the 80GB PS3 core bundles.
6903448	6905248	That would be of course the system by itself.
6905968	6917011	It says basically that they are not to take rain checks on an advertising deal allowing customers to purchase an 80GB core bundle with any PS3 game under $30 for $380 after a $20 discount.
6917031	6917871	And I'm assuming that's $380 Canadian.
6924819	6934127	and apparently Ranma also says that the rain checks can't be accepted because the company cannot promise to fill them with the same item.
6934808	6941414	So basically saying more or less that they're not going to be available and that they're phasing them out.
6943072	6946434	and basically a big neon sign that says the PS3 Slim is true.
6946614	6949215	So shut up with these rumors story.
6949536	6952737	In fact, I don't want any more stories about the PS3 Slim being a rumor.
6953098	6953798	It's confirmed.
6953938	6955619	If this doesn't confirm it, I don't know what does.
6955779	6957700	It is true.
6959401	6959881	It's happening.
6960982	6962383	Yes, it's happening.
6963603	6964884	I know it's happening.
6965304	6968046	I don't want to hear this nonsense about a rumored PS3 Slim.
6968086	6968566	It's happening.
6969166	6971128	It's just a matter of Sony to reveal date and price.
6971288	6971648	That's it.
6973339	6973919	Well, you do.
6974520	6982385	I don't know if this is one of the stories, but for the Games Conference in, I think it's in Germany, wherever, Europe.
6982865	6983346	Leipzig?
6984146	6984566	Not anymore.
6984827	6985447	I think it's somewhere else.
6985487	6986127	Oh, yeah, that's right.
6986828	6987869	Anyways, Games Conference.
6988729	6995494	Sony has booked three hours for talking, you know, their keynote or whatever that's going to be there.
6997415	6999076	Could maybe this be something that they're talking about?
6999316	6999657	You think?
6999677	7000477	PS3 Slam?
7001098	7001298	I mean...
7001983	7005364	Why not take it to a country that's received the PlayStation a little better than the U.S.?
7005404	7006865	This is why we didn't hear about it at E3.
7006885	7008125	They're waiting to announce it for Europe.
7010066	7010666	At the price point of $800.
7012707	7013287	Let's hope not.
7014167	7014968	I wouldn't get it.
7015988	7017248	That would be just... Oh, God.
7017488	7019629	I bet something stupid like that does happen.
7020289	7021090	Let me put it this way.
7022090	7026472	The PS3 Slim is coming out like the sun rises every day, okay?
7026732	7026872	It's...
7028058	7028798	without fail.
7029318	7035439	And if we've learned anything from Sony rumor stories, it's that most of the time they come true.
7035459	7037600	It's true.
7037620	7039320	Especially if you hear them over and over and over again.
7039340	7039520	It's true.
7039540	7041140	I mean, if this isn't confirmation, what is?
7041440	7049022	Gee, we have to get rid of the 80 gigabyte bundles because we're not going to be getting any more in and we can't ever guarantee that we're going to be able to replace them because they're just not being made anymore.
7049082	7049862	I wonder why.
7050482	7055883	Didn't we say a couple weeks ago on this show, Sony's going to start clearing stuff out when it's time to get a new bundle out there.
7055923	7057163	When is the Euro Game Conference?
7058506	7059006	I remember Bookworm
7079775	7081296	Yeah, Bookworm Adventures is kind of neat.
7081336	7085497	It's kind of like a role-playing game meets Boggle, I guess is the best way I could describe it.
7085537	7095361	You make these words out of a Boggle-style board, and depending on how long you make the words and what kind of special gems and things you use in the words, you attack monsters that approach you.
7095441	7099763	So it's a little bit role-playing-ish, although I wouldn't say there's a world map or anything like that.
7099783	7101504	Why hasn't this come to the DS yet?
7101904	7104425	I'm actually kind of surprised we haven't really seen this anywhere but the PC.
7105555	7105875	Nowhere.
7105895	7107616	We haven't seen it on Xbox Live.
7107636	7108656	We haven't seen it on Facebook.
7108676	7109376	We haven't seen it anywhere.
7110016	7110656	Kind of interesting.
7111377	7113317	But yeah, it's going to be released on July 30th.
7113337	7115758	$19.99 is how much it's going to set you back.
7116638	7117098	So there it is.
7117418	7120059	There's also a free trial available on PopCap.com.
7121179	7123140	And yeah, if you haven't played the original, it's fun.
7123600	7130842	And they haven't said exactly what's new about the sequel, but I'm imagining more items, more monsters, more special things.
7131442	7132102	More of the same.
7133368	7134788	But new and improved at the same time.
7135669	7137969	So that's what's coming to Bookworm Adventures 2.
7138049	7140410	That could be fun.
7140570	7144511	Let's get our very own Bookworm DarkSakura to jump into the mailbag and do some reading.
7144911	7145531	Do I gotta?
7145632	7146012	You gotta.
7146072	7149333	It's our mailbag section we do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.
7150713	7154054	When you send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
7156997	7161603	Well, the first email of the day is really short, and I really don't get it, but I'm going to read it anyway.
7161663	7162704	Sent to us by Juan.
7163625	7165107	It's hot here in California, right?
7165127	7165707	108 in LA.
7165868	7166709	That's a spam.
7167309	7167650	It is?
7167830	7168110	Yeah.
7168811	7169892	God damn that spam.
7171089	7173911	Well, I just figured because we were talking about the heat earlier and it was the last one to arrive.
7174091	7175312	It's convenient spam.
7175772	7176813	Yeah.
7176953	7177713	Okay, well then whatever.
7177733	7178954	Fuck you.
7179494	7180735	Well, maybe it wasn't spam.
7180975	7184537	I'll feel bad if it is, but usually those very short emails and stuff.
7184577	7186419	Is there an attachment that's an HTML file?
7186919	7187519	I didn't notice.
7187579	7188820	It's probably spam if it is.
7189180	7190361	Sorry to the listener if it's not.
7190381	7191562	Yeah, there was an attachment.
7191862	7197426	Here, if you want us to know that you're not spam, put OLR or Orange Lounge Radio or something in the title.
7197446	7197866	Then we'll know.
7198246	7198626	Please do.
7200627	7201988	This one comes from Deathwishing.
7202448	7207591	Well, you guys talked about MechWarrior, and I was wondering if you had heard of the BattleMech Firestorm Telsa pods.
7207971	7208751	Yes, we have.
7209291	7212693	Basically, it's MechWarrior 4 put into a huge cabinet to simulate being in the mech.
7213133	7214374	Simply badass.
7214814	7216715	They are rare, though, and mostly at conventions.
7217015	7218476	You should buy one for the studio.
7218676	7220237	Oh, yeah, okay.
7220277	7221697	I got that money in my butt right here.
7221757	7226580	We had BattleMech at Dave & Buster's in Milpitas, and they took it out.
7227100	7228121	Thanks for watching!
7248314	7256261	Well, also, the next email comes from... Well, I just want to say, though, it's still not the same as the real mechs we were talking about last episode.
7256281	7258122	I want a real mech battle arena.
7258523	7258643	No.
7259143	7259924	Like Robot Jocks.
7260564	7264107	Found my screener for Robot Jocks on VHS.
7264728	7266930	Deathwishing in chat says, why would they take it out?
7267270	7269352	Well, because I guess it was expensive.
7269372	7271554	It was expensive, but not enough people were playing it.
7271714	7273655	Yeah, it's expensive and takes up a lot of space.
7274116	7275457	Well, I play that when I can play skee-ball.
7277443	7282306	This one comes from... You didn't actually sign it, so I'm just going to say Tranman.
7282326	7285268	No, from Loomies, sorry.
7286809	7295255	Long-time listener, first-time emailer, do y'all think we will see less third-party games on PSP with the latest NPD results?
7295755	7301279	It seems to sell a decent amount of hardware monthly, but the software isn't anywhere near the top 10.
7301639	7306983	It's disappointing to see a game like Rock Band Unplugged sell only 35,000 units, considering the quality of it.
7307583	7311004	Thanks for taking my email and I hope to have the courage to call in.
7311464	7313405	Also, Sky, please upload the podcast sooner.
7313445	7316106	Best wishes to Loki on the Twins and hi, DarkSakura.
7316946	7317347	Hi!
7319347	7319807	I'll try.
7319827	7321208	I'm really sorry about last week.
7321248	7322528	I explained it earlier in the show, though.
7324702	7327964	As far as third-party games on the PSP, yeah, they keep selling like crap.
7328024	7330086	I mean, again, what's being done to promote these games?
7330986	7332768	I don't see a whole lot of great buzz out there.
7332808	7336950	Although, to be fair, Rock Band Unplugged had probably better buzz than most games out there.
7337030	7339952	So it is kind of sad the game itself didn't do better.
7340053	7346317	But the PSP has just not, I think, penetrated the greater marketplace as the must-have handheld system for gaming.
7346817	7348278	I think it's niche as college kids.
7349219	7349359	So...
7350893	7351514	Last email.
7352514	7352875	Hey guys!
7353855	7358759	This is my first time writing in and I am excited and nervous, so sorry if this comes out sounding weird.
7359179	7360100	You sound weird!
7361075	7365298	I just started listening to your podcast this year and it has been one of the greatest things I've ever found on the internet.
7365719	7368561	Gushing aside, listening to you guys seriously brightens up my day.
7368641	7369882	That sounds like more gushing.
7369942	7370703	Thank you.
7371123	7376127	I actually wanted to get your opinion on two topics, with the first being buying used games.
7376587	7383633	Rob, I know that you were staunch proponent for buying games and hardware because it purports the industry and gets people to keep developing.
7384293	7388937	However, in my case, the money just doesn't exist for me to buy new games most of the time, so I buy mainly...
7391929	7392669	I think you missed a word.
7392990	7395631	So I buy mainly used and then new when I can.
7396352	7401295	So what kind of effect do you think used game buyers have on the industry since our money isn't going directly to the company?
7402175	7403096	I'll end it with that one for right now.
7403502	7406384	Oh, I don't think I'm against buying used games.
7406504	7408126	I just don't really do it myself.
7409026	7410187	I don't really have a good reason why.
7410227	7412269	I guess I just like kind of knowing where the game's been.
7412689	7413329	I will, though.
7413510	7417913	I usually buy games either when they first come out or not at all, or when they get very, very cheap.
7419194	7419554	I don't know.
7419914	7421756	I wouldn't say I'm against used game buying.
7421796	7424798	I mean, it's just part of the nature of the entertainment business.
7424858	7426159	Same thing happens with DVDs.
7426219	7430963	It hasn't killed the movie studios yet, so I'm not against it, actually.
7431730	7432671	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7448147	7449529	Not exactly.
7449669	7453692	You're indirectly, I think, helping the industry because you're helping the economy.
7455094	7464182	By keeping cash in, cash out, by keeping the flow of business going, you're eventually putting more money in people's pockets to be able to go out and buy new games.
7464863	7466925	For lack of a better way to put it.
7467179	7472061	And with all the download content that's out there now in this day and age, I don't think these companies are going to be particularly bankrupt.
7472481	7476662	Why do you think companies do this pay to unlock crap in the first place?
7476802	7479343	Why do you think companies do this pay to unlock crap in the first place?
7479724	7482945	Because it's their way of still making a little bit of money even off of used games.
7483145	7483565	Think about it.
7483945	7484385	There's that.
7485026	7487006	Second question is this.
7487387	7490688	What do you think about the concept of a semi-hardcore gamer?
7491068	7493209	Do you feel... Wait, I gotta read this for the chat.
7493649	7497591	SSJ100Matt says you don't buy used underwear, but they sell it at thrift stores.
7497891	7498932	People do buy used underwear.
7499672	7504374	It's frightening, but they also do sell used underwear and vending machines.
7504774	7509056	You know, myself, I also don't, you know, put my dick next to a video game.
7509216	7509816	You know what I mean?
7510417	7511117	Does that make sense?
7512651	7513892	My second question is this.
7513912	7515233	Somebody else might have though, I guess.
7515673	7517174	There's your reason not to buy a used game.
7517514	7518054	Rob.
7518155	7518455	What?
7518875	7519355	What do you think?
7519375	7520396	Somebody put their balls on it.
7521156	7521597	Rob!
7522777	7525139	I'm gonna do that.
7525399	7530983	Before I take my games back to GameStop now, I'm gonna give them one last goodbye by placing my balls on them.
7531123	7531403	Rob.
7531963	7532263	What?
7536686	7537927	I'm just saying.
7538988	7539328	Anyway.
7540208	7540849	Balls on game.
7541331	7543732	My second question is this.
7544392	7546893	What do you think about the concept of a semi-hardcore gamer?
7546993	7548034	Do you feel they exist?
7548134	7552076	And if so, why are they often overlooked in gaming discussion and marketing?
7554757	7556698	I would say I'm a semi-hardcore gamer.
7556838	7558899	I don't really consider myself a hardcore gamer.
7559239	7561160	Take one look at my gamer score on Xbox Live.
7561180	7562380	You'll see I'm not a hardcore gamer.
7562480	7564661	I think we actually fit into that category somewhere.
7565121	7568883	We're more like educated gamers where we enjoy that we're enthusiasts.
7569483	7570903	I like that word a whole lot.
7570923	7572004	We're enthusiasts.
7572084	7574944	Yeah, but I don't think we're necessarily hardcore.
7575085	7582827	I think a lot of us, between our jobs, our significant others, our other hobbies, we don't have time to play a lot of video games.
7583327	7584367	But we play enough.
7584987	7586047	We're somewhere in the middle there.
7586468	7588728	So yeah, absolutely semi-hardcore gamers exist.
7588968	7590129	And what was the second part of the question?
7590229	7590809	Do they exist?
7590989	7591509	And if so...
7592911	7603168	if so, why are they oh crap, I hit reply by accident okay if so, why are they often overlooked in gaming discussion and marketing um
7604209	7604930	That's a good question.
7629969	7631590	Yeah, well, yeah, that's true too.
7631650	7639295	And I think for a lot of people, especially the semi-hardcore gamers, if you will, they're more hardcore about certain types of games than others.
7639515	7641757	And that's another reason why I think we fit in this category.
7642137	7646860	A hardcore gamer, wouldn't a true hardcore gamer play all games no matter what?
7647381	7652404	I think that actually it has to go more towards hardcore into what you're really into.
7652464	7655406	Like, I would say I'm definitely hardcore into Sims 3 right now.
7656006	7657708	You know, you were hardcore in World of Warcraft.
7657728	7658428	You're a hardcore nerd.
7658908	7659149	So?
7660209	7662671	But I wouldn't say I'm necessarily a hardcore gamer.
7662711	7665113	I don't play Madden or sports games that come out.
7665153	7667455	I'm so stupid in those type of games.
7667495	7669457	But I think it has to do with what you like best.
7671278	7673160	For me, I play Sims all day.
7673420	7676663	Then again, I also am not working and can't really do much with my hand.
7677629	7682513	Um, when you were playing, like, but like I say, when you were playing World of Warcraft and you were playing Final Fantasy XI, weren't you fairly gung-ho?
7682633	7683433	Yeah, pretty much.
7683834	7686195	You know, it all has to do with what you're into.
7686235	7687777	Like, there's people that live on Evercrack.
7687937	7688537	Oh my god.
7689278	7692880	That's... And people who go, oh, all I do is play World of Warcraft.
7693100	7694762	You know, you weren't that bad, but that's hardcore.
7695322	7698865	There's people that live on the internet and end up like the kids in South Park at the end of that episode.
7699385	7699825	Mom!
7700145	7700466	Bathroom.
7701967	7702147	But...
7704336	7704676	I don't know.
7704716	7707117	I think that it's not necessarily an overlooking.
7707177	7712338	It's just also you have to keep in mind that our society tends to work in extremes.
7714078	7721120	A or B. The shades of gray would probably not be cost effective to market to.
7722000	7729822	So they go for A or B and hope that A 2.0 is somewhere in the middle of it.
7730522	7731922	All those little decimals in between.
7733600	7739364	I think that answers the question why people don't break down things further into the semi-hardcore because it's got to be one extreme or the other.
7740385	7742186	It was awesome to get a chance to talk to you guys.
7742306	7743407	Later, Molten Brown.
7744207	7745768	Well, thanks for emailing us, dude.
7745868	7749251	Try not to get some Molten Brown on your DVDs before you give them back.
7749271	7749771	Oh, shush.
7750352	7751432	You're awful, Rob.
7751593	7752073	Awful.
7753234	7753934	Call in, dude.
7753954	7754675	We'd like to talk to you.
7756056	7758578	And by the way, I must say,
7759848	7760929	This must be said.
7761590	7768257	That was a very intelligently worded email and I found no grammatical errors.
7768398	7769258	Email of the week.
7769319	7769979	A winner is you.
7770039	7770520	Congrats.
7772182	7772502	All right.
7773603	7777647	Fear of the Claw says, why are we still discussing testicular insertion instead of video games?
7777908	7781572	Actually, my last comment was referring to putting your butt on it.
7782864	7784425	You said putting your balls on it.
7784985	7785605	I did that too.
7785625	7788747	Unless you wipe your balls with your balls.
7790027	7792348	Unless someone wipes your balls with their butt or something.
7792989	7794209	That is really disgusting.
7794870	7797071	We're laughing because it's funny and we're immature.
7799752	7800652	Alright, moving on.
7802993	7806315	I think we've disgusted a lot of our listeners tonight and rightfully so.
7807819	7809746	I think the listeners are ready for the FUs of the week.
7809946	7811812	They are definitely ready for the FUs of the week.
7827728	7830750	And wouldn't you know, tonight's inspiration comes from World of Warcraft.
7830810	7838276	That's right, it's an 18-year-old who lives in Greenwood, Indiana, currently being investigated by the FBI for making serious threats on World of Warcraft.
7838757	7847203	Apparently on Monday, he said in-game that he was, quote, going to board a plane at 7.30 to Chicago and that he was going to try and kill as many Americans as possible.
7847723	7849585	He left some other messages as well.
7849905	7853588	Blizzard notified the authorities believing the person was serious.
7854369	7854589	The...
7855029	7868654	The person who's been charged with this claimed that their account was hacked, but then the kid later owned up, saying it was a joke, basically stemming from the belief that the cops wouldn't really go to your house if you make serious terrorist threats.
7869214	7869594	Oops!
7871395	7874056	You were wrong on that one, weren't you, dumbass?
7875977	7877337	Let's get into the FUs of the week.
7878538	7883900	My FU goes to my hand for hurting like a motherfucker.
7884815	7886295	Yes, like a motherfucker.
7886355	7889276	And the reason why it hurts is because I had... It was fucking mothers?
7890777	7894878	Because I had my physical therapy and the exercises hurt quite a bit.
7895438	7898559	And also, another F you to the suture that was left in my hand.
7898719	7901720	I understand why it was left in, but it's a pain in the ass.
7902040	7903401	A pain in the hand, really, I should say.
7903421	7904841	A pain in my palm.
7906102	7906522	I hate it.
7908782	7909002	Done.
7909383	7911143	That guy is a stupid stupid.
7912183	7912824	That's what he is.
7913504	7913664	Sorry.
7915370	7922858	F you to having the volunteer on Friday, because painting a fence in 100 degree weather is totally how I'd like to spend my Friday afternoon.
7923659	7926502	Just because I'm too lazy to tell them no.
7928224	7929546	And F you to the weather because it's too hot.
7930638	7932319	My FU of the week definitely goes to the weather.
7932499	7933440	Fuck the sun.
7933620	7934221	I am dying.
7934241	7936763	Like, I seriously, like, I just need to sleep or something.
7936843	7938124	I'm feeling so sick right now.
7938144	7939124	Like, I'm just, like, off.
7939545	7940966	I'm gonna keel over and die or something.
7941366	7943287	Not really, but, man, the heat sucks.
7943768	7945569	And what's weird, I've been indoors most of the day.
7945609	7949071	I guess I was out in the car for a while driving around, but it wasn't that hot.
7949632	7950552	I've been drinking water.
7950913	7951813	I think I'm gonna get more, though.
7952514	7956477	I'm gonna sneak out during the next story and get more water, because water rocks.
7957445	7959047	You want some more lemonade?
7959467	7960508	I made a fresh thing of it.
7960548	7962750	Okay, yeah, I want more lemonade.
7964372	7966934	I love having a woman on the show who makes me food and drink.
7967494	7971378	First and foremost, you have a southern woman and you're in my home.
7972579	7975562	She is serving me drinks out of a mason jar, by the way, just so you know.
7976135	7982116	It is natural for me to want to make sure that you guys, as my guests, are taken care of.
7982376	7983236	And I appreciate it.
7983656	7987197	So, if you want to blame something, blame Alabama.
7987837	7989277	Well, thank you, Alabama.
7989837	7991378	Now get in the kitchen and get me some pie.
7992838	7994038	Hey, I'll give you pie.
7997399	7999999	I'll give you a mud pie from your backyard.
8000579	8002580	Or maybe one of Shermie's cat pies.
8002700	8003320	I'll give you a pie. 3.14159.
8006383	8007123	Alright, moving on.
8007283	8011405	Loki, help save our show from the completely immature path it's gone down.
8011905	8013186	Alright, let's see.
8013806	8019608	Well, I guess I could talk about this really unique game coming out called Miner Wars.
8020108	8023890	It's an MMO for the PC and Xbox Live Arcade.
8024370	8026191	You know, that's something you normally don't see.
8026551	8028192	It's apparently coming from a...
8029272	8051390	SoftwareHouse named Keen and I guess their new space shooter MMO Miner Wars they're planning on releasing on Xbox Live Arcade as well as PC and it's I guess coming it's supposedly coming out I guess autumn 2009 and that's kind of interesting so yeah
8052915	8072807	I don't know, they're saying that the world premiere will be August 2000, or autumn I'm sorry, I read that wrong, autumn 2009 so I wonder if that's coming out or if that's the first time we're going to see it who knows, but the fact that they're putting an MMO on Xbox Live Arcade would be interesting I wonder how they're going to do that Interesting and the two are supposed to talk to each other?
8072948	8074168	Is that what I'm understanding right?
8074228	8081473	That the two games would actually talk to each other through PC people could play on and so forth?
8081815	8087905	It's something that they'd like to do, and there were probably some compromises, but they're going to try to incorporate it.
8089808	8090048	Hmm.
8091791	8092272	Interesting.
8092577	8093617	Yeah, it was pretty cool.
8093877	8100620	I mean, I guess the concept's cool, though, but doesn't... I mean, like, what if the game itself sucks, though?
8100840	8104161	I mean, it's kind of like, I'm reminded of the game I played this week, BitBoy.
8104541	8113044	It sounded great in writing, and the whole idea of an MMO that's on Xbox Live Arcade and PC is great in writing, but if the game itself kind of blows, then what can you do?
8113764	8116085	I don't know that much, I guess, but I guess we'll have to find out.
8116285	8117085	Maybe try the demo.
8118205	8118705	I guess that's true.
8118725	8119806	I guess that means there would be a demo.
8120874	8122356	So at least there's that, if nothing else.
8123297	8130747	Alright, well, we got one more story for you guys before we open up the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8131367	8135733	And that story is about a game franchise I'm sure you're excited to see.
8136594	8138797	Murder, She Wrote is getting a franchise.
8138857	8139217	Really?
8139838	8140098	X-Rated
8168308	8170669	You know you want to see topless Angela Lansbury, come on.
8171429	8172389	Just kidding.
8173250	8173590	Let's see.
8174650	8176611	What else is happening in this game here?
8176871	8183453	It's about the Summer Garden Festival that you... What the hell is this game?
8184847	8190415	Today is the Summer Gardens Festival Gardens Competition and Tour, an event I look forward to all year.
8190816	8197385	My tour group arrived at Matthew O'Neill's house at approximately 12.45pm only to discover Matthew lying dead in his garden.
8197405	8200810	So basically you're going to explore a garden and try to find out who killed this person.
8201701	8202562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8224377	8230743	If you want to call in and talk about Murder, She Wrote or any game, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8231203	8233845	For now, I'll open it up in studio to some last minute stories.
8234406	8236868	Resident Evil 4 will be coming to the iPhone in July.
8236888	8244095	This is realized after it shortly leaked out and was pulled, but Capcom has confirmed they'll be... Hold on, we have a call.
8244135	8245095	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8245115	8245476	Who's this?
8248100	8248380	Hello?
8249240	8250401	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
8250421	8250801	Who's this?
8251521	8252902	Oh, this is Juan Gonzalez.
8254222	8257443	So wait, are you the guy that emailed us earlier and I said, no, it's spam?
8259064	8262025	I take back my declaration of FU.
8262045	8262485	Sorry.
8263746	8273670	Do you know how many emails we get from guys named Juan that say something about like completely off the topic and nonsensical that turn out to be spam?
8277051	8277271	Hello?
8278641	8285792	I don't know if you can hear me right now, but I accidentally pressed email to everyone.
8287073	8290619	So you are a real person and you're not trying to sell us a Viagra?
8292932	8293753	Hello?
8293813	8295154	I think he's breaking up.
8295434	8295634	Hello?
8320440	8321741	If you have a question, go ahead and ask.
8321761	8325543	We're having a hard time hearing you, so try to get your question out there so we can answer it.
8330486	8330927	Ah, fail.
8331647	8332227	Sorry, Juan.
8333148	8335109	But we take back what we said about you being a spammer.
8335649	8336330	That's so funny.
8338846	8341428	All right, sorry the connection was bad, Juan.
8341448	8346991	But remember, guys, if you're going to call in on Skype, you can always call Echo123 to call and test your call first.
8347011	8347972	That's always a good way to do it.
8348292	8349313	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8349333	8349673	Who's this?
8351134	8352675	Hi, this is Spazinator.
8352775	8353375	Hi, Spazinator.
8353395	8353876	What's on your mind?
8355657	8359319	Um, you know, like, you know, three really quick tips.
8360180	8360400	Um...
8361300	8373109	Well, I forget whether it was at the very end of Bobby's show or at the beginning of your show proper, but regardless, you guys were talking about
8374961	8396886	Namco Museum Essentials they had just come out Yes, and just to restate in case we have people listening to our show that aren't listening to Bobby's show which shame on you, everybody should listen to Bobby but at the little toss we did at the end of Bobby's show we had brought up the whole Playstation 3 Namco Essentials had come out and I had wanted to check it out and I'm guessing maybe you got a chance to?
8398627	8403708	Yes, in fact I had just bought it literally bought it the day it came out
8404717	8426246	and in my opinion, well, I don't know if my opinion holds any weight, but basically, for the most part, the games are basically the same as any other version that they may have gotten over the years, whether it be for the PlayStation 2 or what have you.
8426346	8428547	Where the real draw is, is...
8431462	8449589	In the menu system, they give you a card for each of the six games, and you get stamped for in-game achievements, like Apple and Pac-Man or whatever.
8451109	8454951	So not trophies, but kind of like a localized in-game achievement type of thing.
8455771	8455971	Yeah.
8456471	8456711	Yes.
8456971	8458612	How many games do you get for your $10?
8459352	8469375	Don't you get, like, I mean, that's one thing I noticed right off the bat, is that, well, on Xbox Live, you have to pay, like, $5 for the port of Pac-Man, but it seems like on this little Namco collection, you're getting, like, what, six games for $10?
8469415	8482278	Yes, six games for $10, but what I was going to say is, where the draw is, is that with those cards, if you...
8485632	8504714	Get so many stamps per card, like let's say three stamps on a card, then you get a trophy, get another three more, you unlock certain prizes that go with the phone, like t-shirts or other items.
8506636	8508137	and so on and so forth.
8508377	8510919	Plus, you get the online leaderboards and all that.
8511099	8513481	So that's probably where the main draw is.
8514061	8515182	Well, is it cool though?
8515202	8518144	Because in theory, that concept sounds really cool to me.
8518204	8518844	So you picked it up.
8518884	8520525	I mean, have you unlocked anything at home?
8520886	8521346	Is it cool?
8521366	8523087	Does it kind of work the way you think it would?
8525128	8526049	Yeah.
8526690	8529632	I got like two t-shirts out of it so far.
8530652	8534275	And plus, I actually, while I was at home...
8535445	8549113	I actually launched each of the games from insightful and I walked up to each of the replicas of the arcade machines and played the games and they seemed pretty good.
8550593	8554396	So that's kind of a neat little plus there.
8555396	8562360	And plus, you know, technically it's not tired games
8562911	8564933	by playing the arcade stuff in there, like...
8580566	8583508	You can get collector's items, a version of solo cans, and stuff like that.
8583528	8587531	Maybe I'll finally have motivation to open up the Orange Lounge Club at home too.
8587551	8587731	We'll see.
8606764	8611046	By the way, Spazinator, we've got to hang up to get some more calls, but do you have anything else on your mind real quick?
8612727	8615689	Yeah, one last thing.
8615949	8619571	I know you guys like to animate a lot.
8620051	8625534	I just checked out a new movie called Robotech, The Shadow Chronicles.
8625814	8632358	It's an $8 movie that you get from PSN, and it's pretty good.
8633018	8636160	If you like cheap animated movies, you may want to check that out.
8636525	8637585	Alright, so there you go.
8637986	8638946	Anime recommendation.
8639066	8645849	I'm not a huge anime fan, but I'm definitely looking forward to Ponyo, because I do like Miyazaki films, so I'm going to check that out when it comes out in theaters.
8647169	8648630	I will go with you, Rob.
8648850	8651791	Yay, good, because the boyfriend won't, because he says anime is not good.
8652771	8654752	Well, poo!
8656113	8657113	Although he's not really dumb.
8657153	8658113	He's amazing, but anyway.
8658454	8659514	Alright, take care, Spazinator.
8660774	8661555	Alright, have a good one.
8661735	8661955	Later.
8663095	8664616	But seriously, I'm like, you love Disney.
8664796	8666197	I'm like, Disney's putting this movie out.
8666337	8667257	He says, but it's different.
8667297	8667798	It's not the same.
8667858	8671920	I'm like, ah, ah, I can't take it.
8672801	8673001	All right.
8673021	8673941	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8673961	8674301	Who's this?
8676923	8677863	Oh, hold on.
8679164	8679705	Okay, sure.
8679745	8680125	I'll hold.
8681025	8681305	All right.
8681365	8682066	It's Deathwishing.
8682286	8683166	Oh, hi, Deathwishing.
8683186	8683727	What's on your mind?
8685128	8687990	And then Nike popped up and it kind of clusterfucked me.
8688290	8688570	Uh-huh.
8688690	8689050	What's up?
8689850	8690791	Um, giant robots.
8691391	8691691	Uh-huh.
8692412	8692912	Lots of them.
8693372	8695693	I'm really itching to play a giant robot game.
8695813	8696934	Sounds like an awesome game.
8697794	8698354	Tell me more.
8699715	8701036	Well, no, I mean Chromehounds.
8701096	8705278	I want to play Chromehounds and stuff, but... There's too much stuff going on right now.
8706438	8710280	Well, we got Marvel vs. Capcom being re-released, and...
8712717	8714859	Awesome Superhero Hadouken Fest.
8717222	8717522	I know.
8717603	8720285	There's so many games to play in so little time.
8720686	8723109	I had no idea people were still playing Chromehounds, though.
8723930	8724670	Well, I think they are.
8724690	8727373	I see my friend playing it from Britain a lot of times.
8727694	8730497	So I think fans are devoted to their games.
8730537	8731518	Like, look at Counter-Strike.
8732619	8733460	Night Vision Goggle Modern Warfare 2
8759007	8761788	I might not want to see what goes on when it's dark.
8761808	8763529	They're not worth the price, seriously.
8763909	8765210	Come on, they do something.
8765690	8768572	It's just a webcam with the IR filter ripped off of it.
8769554	8770534	Yeah, you're probably right.
8771254	8775695	I mean, if I wanted night vision goggles, which I don't even know what the hell I'd use night vision goggles for.
8775715	8778776	I guess the question is, what would you use them for?
8779076	8779676	Exactly.
8781376	8783817	No, I was just curious.
8784357	8787097	When I heard night vision goggles, I'm like, wow.
8787137	8789498	Before they announced the price, I'm like, holy crap, this must be a fortune.
8789518	8793338	I went to go look at prices for the ones that look exactly like those, and it was like $3,000.
8794038	8797359	I was like, holy crap, these are going to be like ones you go to Toys R Us to buy.
8798641	8801183	It's just because Activision needs yet another game over $100.
8801323	8805567	How many games can we put out there at $120 and plus?
8805607	8807008	It's going to be a good game.
8807449	8808489	I know it's going to be a good game.
8808530	8809791	It's made by Infinity Ward.
8809891	8811512	They make the good shooters.
8811872	8813173	I'm a shooter guy.
8813954	8816676	I don't doubt it'll be a good game, but I think Activision makes a poor decision.
8816696	8821280	That's just literally whipping it out, fapping as hard as you can.
8823322	8823682	That's it.
8827119	8828580	That's a great game review right there.
8829760	8838503	I think some of these pack-ins are a little silly, but I guess Night Vision Goggles is certainly... Are you guys going to Comic Con?
8839383	8839623	No.
8839864	8841924	There's too many conventions to go on this time of year.
8841944	8843905	We went to E3, and then I'm still trying to get to PAX.
8844225	8848727	Which reminds me, actually, we need to look into SAC Anime next month.
8848987	8849307	Oh, really?
8849327	8849587	Yeah.
8850107	8851487	I think it's the same weekend as PAX, isn't it?
8851527	8851788	I don't know.
8854088	8860652	Southern California As much as I would love to go to Comic Con I think it's this coming weekend, isn't it?
8861132	8862773	It's this week Yeah, you know what?
8862893	8865995	I can't go, I have tickets to a concert What concert?
8866815	8868216	Like I tell you, I'm going to see No Doubt
8869025	8870066	Bioshock 2 got delayed.
8870086	8870966	I guess that's true.
8871146	8871266	And...
8899265	8900987	But Bioshock 2 is never coming out in November.
8901007	8901847	It's coming out in October.
8903229	8903449	What?
8904049	8905230	That's what it was coming out.
8906872	8908113	They delayed it this weekend.
8908153	8910154	I know they delayed it, but it was never coming out in November.
8910174	8911015	It's coming out in October.
8912956	8918281	I'm just saying November is usually when everyone starts shipping out all their games and it's just like...
8919645	8921086	Stop it.
8921926	8924607	My wallet is... My pants are burning.
8925007	8929028	DJ Tyrant in chat pointed out that tickets to Comic-Con are sold out anyway, so that's fine.
8929048	8929589	They are?
8929609	8930009	Sneak in.
8930069	8932370	Just break a window or some stuff.
8932810	8935011	Alright, Deathwishing, anything else on your mind before we let you go?
8935111	8935931	We gotta get more calls.
8935991	8936771	Giant robots.
8937051	8937352	Awesome.
8937772	8938592	Alright, take care.
8939152	8939492	Bye.
8940553	8941293	Giant robots.
8942613	8943154	On fire.
8943654	8944474	That would be even better.
8944754	8946315	How about giant robots on fire?
8947059	8950081	That's not good, because then that ruins a perfectly good giant robot.
8951582	8952743	But it's on fire.
8953283	8955805	No, it has to be a giant robot that shoots fire.
8956065	8956606	That's cool.
8956646	8957366	Can I take the call, please?
8957426	8958087	No, you can't.
8958167	8959908	We have to discuss the giant robot shooting fire.
8960368	8961569	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8961589	8962009	Who's this?
8962890	8963470	It's Misty.
8963670	8964091	Hi, Misty.
8964111	8966572	We've got to let you go, because we've got to talk about robots shooting fire.
8967693	8968494	The hell with that?
8969034	8969935	What's on your mind, Misty?
8971552	8976956	Not much really, I just kind of had an announcement I wanted to finally make after trying for practically a month.
8977337	8979158	Okay, what is your big announcement?
8980279	8983701	That I am finally coming to Sac at the end of August.
8984962	8987464	Holy poop balls, you're actually coming to Sacramento.
8989352	8990854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9013094	9015315	I don't really have any particular plans.
9015375	9019355	I was thinking of going to Arvigil for the hell of it at least one or two days.
9019535	9020336	Yep, you got to do that.
9020896	9021256	Oh, yeah.
9021856	9022916	You got to see some of the sites.
9023256	9025116	See some of the OLR historical spots.
9025216	9028917	You got to go to Arvigil, eat at the Brookfields we used to always eat at at the parking lot.
9029417	9029877	Oh, my God.
9029917	9032378	Wouldn't it be cool to have an old school night while she's here?
9032738	9033698	Actually, we can make that happen.
9033718	9034198	Let's do that.
9034478	9035098	On a Wednesday.
9035338	9035858	On a Wednesday.
9036058	9037219	I was hoping so.
9037279	9038479	I kept hearing about that.
9039266	9041047	We'll have to make that happen somehow.
9041127	9044589	So, unfortunately, you're not going to be here on a Sunday, though, right?
9045509	9047731	Yeah, because I'm so damn opposed to flying.
9048191	9048671	That's all right.
9049151	9051333	But, hey, we'll figure something out.
9051373	9052933	We'll do a taped bit or something.
9052973	9055055	We can do OLR on location at Arvigal.
9055915	9057376	Oh, my God.
9057416	9061158	Remember we used to do it when we had the bit that we did over the old Beatmania?
9061178	9061758	Mm-hmm.
9061858	9062759	Of the Hip Hop Mania.
9062879	9063079	Yeah.
9063319	9063859	That was rad.
9063879	9064360	That was fun.
9065220	9069242	I remember getting threatened to throw out of there by kids younger than I am.
9069282	9071464	But hey, that's the way it goes sometimes.
9071984	9072644	So other things.
9073064	9075486	What else will be on the OLR Sacramento Historical Tour?
9075846	9079768	You can go to the Target where we camped out for a wee, where Jamie got recognized from the show.
9079808	9080328	That was fun.
9080949	9081489	It was fun.
9081589	9082670	That's over on Sunrise.
9082790	9083570	And then what else?
9083670	9085351	What other OLR historical stops are there?
9088326	9090087	We could try to make the trip to Stockton.
9090767	9091327	Oh, wow.
9091467	9094408	You want to show Missy the good stuff while you're here?
9095229	9102171	We need to see some of the cryptic counterbalances to see why the other good stuff is so good.
9102231	9102592	That's true.
9102632	9105413	You could go to Scandia, home of Shaft.
9105973	9111595	We'll actually have to play the putt-putt there.
9113396	9115376	And ride the screamer, but you can't scream on it.
9115877	9116117	Yeah.
9117992	9118252	I know.
9118573	9120054	All this will be explained all in due time.
9120335	9125320	Well, hey, let us know again as things are getting a little closer and you got your itinerary all planned out.
9125480	9129544	And we'll definitely meet up with you during the week and figure something out.
9130405	9130905	Yep.
9131226	9136611	That TwitPic I posted is my incoming itinerary with all the Greyhound stops and crap.
9136811	9137032	Nice.
9139335	9139695	All right.
9139975	9145717	Well, we are looking forward to... I've met you in person, but I know the other two haven't, so we're looking forward to having you here.
9145737	9151298	I know you've been a long-time listener, so this is the ultimate in fan trips to take.
9152778	9153218	Indeed.
9153498	9153798	All right.
9154039	9157399	Well, we're going to let you go, Misty, so we can get some more calls, but we will see you soon.
9157459	9157999	And I mean that.
9158059	9158580	See you soon.
9160200	9160540	All righty.
9160560	9161100	I'm excited.
9161300	9161580	Later.
9162440	9162721	Later.
9163721	9165561	I can't believe she's taking a bus, though.
9165661	9166361	Oh, my gosh.
9166401	9168242	That is such a long bus ride.
9169076	9170497	Well, trains are going to be just as bad.
9170517	9171818	Probably a little more expensive too.
9171838	9173159	Yeah, trains are better.
9173560	9174661	But I understand.
9174701	9177423	If you're seriously scared to death of planes, I can understand.
9177443	9178604	It's going to be tough.
9179104	9181666	Alright, let's wrap it up.
9181686	9182787	We're going to close the Skype line.
9182807	9183928	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
9184369	9186470	Let's wrap it up with some last minute stories.
9186510	9188272	I know you probably have a couple we didn't get to, Loki.
9189342	9190283	I'm sure I do.
9206176	9207317	So that's kind of neat.
9208618	9223671	And apparently there was an artist that worked for Google that was hiding Triforces on a bunch of their little Google splashes that they do for different events, different holidays and whatnot.
9224111	9229576	Fortunately, because of all this buzz about said Triforces, they have now been all removed.
9229836	9233159	So that was fun while it lasted, I guess.
9235070	9237295	And the artist responsible has been sacked.
9238077	9240402	I don't know if that's the case, but maybe.
9242441	9248405	There is a game coming to North America, rumored at least, Rizzoad.
9249186	9252809	And that's actually, it's a game based off the Wizard of Oz.
9252829	9254630	Kind of think of Kingdom Hearts meets Wizard of Oz.
9255731	9259033	And for the DS, it's rumored to be coming out over here.
9259113	9260554	Actually, I can tell you it's coming out over here.
9260915	9261795	XSEED's bringing it over.
9263096	9265198	Be coming out this fall, actually, September 1st.
9266144	9267004	Or October, I can't remember.
9267985	9269645	But anyways, so that's kind of neat.
9269905	9273086	A new RPG series maybe we can check out.
9274547	9279429	And Brutal Legend is going to be getting 4 on 4 skirmish multiplayer matches.
9280049	9281549	Hot 4 on 4 action.
9281810	9282710	Yes, exactly.
9282890	9284591	So that's pretty cool.
9284611	9288452	I mean, hey, the game looks awesome by itself, but multiplayer, that just adds to the fun.
9291155	9302742	I think we talked about this before, but apparently a fan is putting together a game based off of the Free Space Open, which I think is an open source free space engine.
9303362	9308465	And basically it's Shadows of Liet, which is a Star Fox type of game.
9309246	9311947	And this is currently in development right now.
9312488	9319052	But luckily, I'm guessing at the rate it's going and the amount of coverage it's getting right now, that probably will never happen.
9319072	9319592	It'll probably get...
9320072	9321013	Cease and desist.
9321773	9322554	Which is too bad.
9323354	9328898	And then of course, you know, people have been editing the PC version of Street Fighter 4 that has been recently released.
9329339	9333522	Doing all sorts of things such as making Cammy nude, which looks retarded.
9334222	9338485	And swapping people's, um, their movesets.
9338685	9341347	I was watching Dan with Dhalsim's moves, that's funny.
9341407	9342288	Which looks pretty funny.
9342708	9343229	And, um...
9344400	9347061	I don't know, that's about as bad as when they were doing that with Smash Bros.
9348021	9352202	And then a game I'd like to talk about real quick that they had a clip of it online.
9352242	9353342	Looks fucking sweet.
9353883	9357584	It's The Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is the name of the game.
9358024	9360924	And it kind of has a similar art style to Pot upon.
9361365	9367006	But it's this game where you fly around a little UFO and it's kind of a shooter puzzle platformer game.
9367566	9369067	And it looks absolutely crazy.
9369287	9371967	So definitely check out the video if you haven't yet.
9372388	9373448	It's got an awesome little...
9376374	9385700	I think the actual website is the incredible insanelytwistedshadowplanet.com I think this is actually the website.
9386881	9395206	But the guy that's responsible for it is an animator and he's done a bunch of really cool stuff.
9396007	9397428	So definitely worth checking out.
9398683	9404065	And then another game that's supposed to be coming out that looks pretty cool on XNA is Vex and Silence.
9404805	9410887	It's a kind of a stylized first-person shooter game and actually looks pretty polished for an XNA game.
9411347	9413508	But you can check out more information on that.
9414168	9418689	It's going to span, I guess, 13 levels and have a side-scrolling shooter as well.
9419229	9420290	Oh, it is a side-scrolling shooter.
9420310	9422010	It looked like a first-person shooter from what I saw.
9423431	9427332	But anyways, VexandSilence.com and that's V-E-K-S
9428512	9429632	So check that out.
9430613	9431033	That's it.
9433913	9439075	Alright, well, that's going to wrap it up for our show tonight, but we can't end until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9439135	9441255	So, DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight?
9441535	9444836	They have finally put out custom hair for Sims 3.
9445236	9446116	I think that's fantastic.
9446477	9447057	Hooray!
9447657	9448557	Loki, your final thought?
9449157	9451978	My final thought is I had something to share, but I don't have it anymore.
9453138	9453678	How useful.
9453938	9456259	I didn't set it to myself right.
9457079	9460942	Alright, and my final thought is, oh my god, I'm seriously going to pass out from the heat.
9462303	9463084	Damn you, son.
9463985	9464465	Go away.
9464985	9465846	Actually, it is away now.
9465906	9468028	It's finally set, but don't come up again tomorrow.
9468468	9468829	I hate you.
9469909	9470389	Thanks for watching!
