witty commentary in the classic game of the week she's out this week sadly she

01:02.960 --> 01:06.040
is in Las Vegas so I guess it's really not that sad because I'm sure she's

01:06.040 --> 01:09.440
having a great time in Vegas she's hanging out with one of our olr

01:09.440 --> 01:15.280
staffers tiara our our our our our and I'm sure they're having fun being big

01:15.280 --> 01:19.320
giggling girls and know that I always tease them about that but I know they're

01:19.320 --> 01:23.240
having a good time nerding it up I'm sure if there was a Star Trek

01:23.240 --> 01:26.880
experience I'm sure they'd be there right now but sadly it's closed but yes

01:26.880 --> 01:31.520
so they reopened it they're going to reopen it soon but it's not open yet

01:31.520 --> 01:34.800
especially you know the worst time to close it right before the movie comes

01:34.800 --> 01:39.760
out I know I'm a potential bummer whoops well we still have you guys in our chat

01:39.760 --> 01:43.480
room chat that orange launch radio.com I don't know I wonder if dark Sakura might

01:43.480 --> 01:46.160
be listening and I think her and tiara just kind of hanging out tonight they're

01:46.160 --> 01:51.360
just kind of away so if so I expect angry text messages they shouldn't be

01:51.360 --> 01:56.360
listening they should be gambling and seeing shows and that's right go see

01:56.360 --> 02:00.880
Cirque du Soleil other debauchery exactly well remember what happens in

02:00.880 --> 02:04.960
Vegas stays in Vegas so but it's it's interesting though what you guys don't

02:04.960 --> 02:09.280
understand is that we're still at her house the studio is still at it you know

02:09.280 --> 02:13.960
studio dark Sakura so we're here in her house when she's not here which is a

02:13.960 --> 02:17.920
little creepy but dance here you know Dan's entertaining company right now

02:17.920 --> 02:20.800
they're watching a movie I couldn't figure out what it was these last star

02:20.800 --> 02:24.380
fighter thing is what it is what's happened there was maybe it looks 80s

02:24.380 --> 02:29.120
horrific and yeah but anyhow you know they're they're doing their thing so it

02:29.120 --> 02:32.760
looks like there was a fourth of july bash going on here because you can see

02:32.760 --> 02:36.200
all the fireworks out in the street all the residue how was your fourth of july

02:36.200 --> 02:40.640
I didn't buy fireworks because in California the fireworks all suck here

02:40.640 --> 02:46.400
they're they're getting more safe and sane as the time goes on so you buy you

02:46.400 --> 02:50.600
know $100 for the fireworks and they last like five minutes because they're

02:50.600 --> 02:56.420
crap and so being smart and you know just plain lazy and broke this year

02:56.420 --> 03:00.360
decided you know I'm just not gonna buy fireworks so we decided to go down to

03:00.360 --> 03:06.360
our local mall that was doing a fireworks show and so we went kind of

03:06.360 --> 03:13.360
sat on my sister's apartment lawn and watched them from there so that was

03:13.360 --> 03:16.960
alright you know it's like whatever which is funny cuz Loki and I were at

03:16.960 --> 03:20.880
the same show last night except I was in the actual mall parking lot which is

03:20.880 --> 03:25.680
funny this is the unplanned we were at the same place yeah so took us an hour

03:25.680 --> 03:30.140
to get out of that goddamn lot three minutes for us you suck well we were

03:30.140 --> 03:35.960
far enough away so yeah that's what we basically did and it was okay I mean

03:35.960 --> 03:40.520
it's just I don't know it's fourth of July how many times do you have to hear

03:40.520 --> 03:43.680
the same songs and the same fireworks although this year they did have

03:43.680 --> 03:48.200
smiley-face fireworks so that was kind of neat you know innovating a little bit

03:48.200 --> 03:52.040
but yeah that was alright and then actually it's kind of funny cuz normally

03:52.040 --> 03:57.080
we used to go to like the Folsom rodeo just because they have fireworks there

03:57.080 --> 04:02.980
as well and actually this year the night before because they do the rodeo like

04:02.980 --> 04:08.400
for you know three days or so so they like the Friday Saturday Sunday or maybe

04:08.400 --> 04:13.880
this year is Thursday Friday Saturday anyways so they had fireworks each night

04:13.880 --> 04:18.440
and unfortunately the second night apparently there was an accident and one

04:18.440 --> 04:25.080
of the mortars shot off into the crowd burning people so don't sad I miss that

04:25.080 --> 04:31.800
so oh well but um yeah that's pretty much it isn't like final destination

04:31.800 --> 04:37.000
where you had a premonition to not go to know if by premonition meaning that the

04:37.000 --> 04:43.240
rodeo sucked every year then yeah I guess well we normally don't actually go

04:43.240 --> 04:48.200
into the rodeo we just watch it from outside but and they would they started

04:48.200 --> 04:51.160
figuring out the people are doing that so they shot they keep shooting the

04:51.160 --> 04:55.680
fireworks even lower and I mean that's dangerous enough but you know because

04:55.680 --> 04:59.720
they go hey you gotta come in the rodeo to see the fireworks you know so we're

04:59.720 --> 05:04.400
gonna shoot them ten feet above everybody it's like come on but I know

05:04.400 --> 05:08.200
well I reading our chat room at chat that orange laundry calm looking at some

05:08.200 --> 05:11.040
of the commentary a tiger claws suggesting we need someone to make olr

05:11.040 --> 05:15.000
fireworks fireworks that explode into the olr logo hey I'd be down for that

05:15.000 --> 05:18.280
except they're private I love it dark Ted see this is why can't they play

05:18.280 --> 05:22.640
America fuck yeah during a show I said the exact same so did I I said the

05:22.640 --> 05:25.320
exact same thing last night were you listening to the whole simulcast they

05:25.320 --> 05:29.680
didn't yes that was crap they're playing you know god bless the USA and all they

05:29.680 --> 05:32.640
you know patriotic stuff I was like they need to just bust out with America fuck

05:32.640 --> 05:38.000
yeah like really something like some good rock music or something it's always

05:38.000 --> 05:43.840
the same like crap or you know Bruce Springsteen you know even really the

05:43.840 --> 05:50.400
music I mean it was just kind of sort of you know it I don't know just I would go

05:50.400 --> 05:57.280
to a fireworks show like that America fuck yeah and just that the biggest fire

05:57.280 --> 06:01.200
you could possibly imagine well since I like fire a lot not only did I see the

06:01.200 --> 06:04.800
fireworks by the way happy 4th of July to all the other American folks listen

06:04.800 --> 06:07.840
to our program if you're not American well I hope you had a good weekend

06:07.840 --> 06:12.040
nonetheless and you happy Canada Day to those our friends in Canada because that

06:12.040 --> 06:15.080
was just this past week as well three days before ours exactly and you know

06:15.080 --> 06:18.640
what it's not really I mean a lot of people I guess celebrate independence I

06:18.640 --> 06:22.040
just celebrate the fact they get the light stuff on fire exactly that's all I

06:22.040 --> 06:26.040
really celebrate but I think that's something that the whole world can

06:26.040 --> 06:29.960
celebrate okay some of those safe insane fireworks though are a little crazy okay

06:29.960 --> 06:34.280
because like okay we really like fire so not only do we go to the public fireworks

06:34.280 --> 06:37.880
show but then we came back and let off some of our private stash and you know

06:37.880 --> 06:41.280
Victoria Victoria was there and she had brought her 11 year old brother like

06:41.280 --> 06:45.760
stepbrother or something came came with her and he's pretty cool like we were

06:45.760 --> 06:48.680
talking video games and stuff he thought it was cool that I played Xbox and had a

06:48.680 --> 06:53.200
show on the net and all that stuff and he likes video games and stuff I guess

06:53.200 --> 06:57.320
him and Victoria actually bought at one of the safe and stay insane stands it's

06:57.320 --> 07:02.000
called a bazooka and it is literally a firework that you sit on your shoulder

07:02.000 --> 07:06.560
and you're like the fuse on the other end and it shoots off like a masses

07:06.560 --> 07:10.240
amounts of color and sparks and I'm like okay wait a minute isn't this something

07:10.240 --> 07:13.160
that you like sit on the ground and do this whole thing when they're like no

07:13.160 --> 07:16.640
the lady at the thing told us that you you all put it on your side like a

07:16.640 --> 07:21.480
bazooka or is this a video game show a super scope six it's super scope six of

07:21.480 --> 07:25.080
fireworks you have to literally like put it on your shoulder okay like I thought

07:25.080 --> 07:28.560
it was going to be a pathetic little display like a sparkler or something no

07:28.560 --> 07:32.840
this thing was a like it didn't last very long it was only about like 30

07:32.840 --> 07:37.780
seconds but it shot off like monsters of color and sparks like so much that the

07:37.780 --> 07:41.600
kid got afraid and was started backing up a little bit and we were all actually

07:41.600 --> 07:44.800
kind of like um this can't be good but he was like scared to hold it and all

07:44.800 --> 07:48.520
this stuff we were like just you and Victoria was just like you fucking bought

07:48.520 --> 07:56.560
it you fucking hold it this is great so you know teaching them young so yeah and

07:56.560 --> 08:00.720
it was it was cool we set it off and it was it was it was very amusing at least

08:00.720 --> 08:04.960
for those 30 seconds the other thing we did during 4th July is we were watching

08:04.960 --> 08:09.480
Comedy Central all day where they had a marathon of like stand-up comedy which

08:09.480 --> 08:12.760
is awesome so there's a bunch of comedians and they're like oh yeah

08:12.760 --> 08:17.760
that's that guy that I wanted to see you know it's those pretty much it yeah we

08:17.760 --> 08:21.120
don't have any unfortunately at our club we don't have cool things like Roman

08:21.120 --> 08:23.720
candles here yeah he's asking if I'm talking about Roman candles no you don't

08:23.720 --> 08:26.960
point this wasn't something you point upwards you hold it like a bazooka or a

08:26.960 --> 08:31.620
super scope six and it shoots sideways but what's shooting out looks like the

08:31.620 --> 08:34.720
type of thing you would see in a normal safe and sane firework I don't know how

08:34.720 --> 08:38.960
to describe this for people not in California but like you know the just

08:38.960 --> 08:44.120
the little sparks to go you know like the little little tiny flames of red

08:44.120 --> 08:47.920
green yellow it's not what it used to be like sparklers don't really sparkle

08:47.920 --> 08:51.000
anymore they're just kind of a little flame and yeah they look like colors

08:51.000 --> 08:55.240
flames sparks coming out but you know we basically use the sparklers and I was

08:55.240 --> 09:01.920
just like you know pucks and basically but yeah I mean I've seen my friend's

09:01.920 --> 09:08.120
dad is a firefighter and or fire chief actually and he gets you know he

09:08.120 --> 09:12.720
confiscates all the fireworks conference gates yeah unquote stashes

09:12.720 --> 09:15.800
them for his own fireworks and my brother was a firefighter I know all

09:15.800 --> 09:20.480
about confidence so they have you know they had like little boxes that are

09:20.480 --> 09:23.920
mortars and stuff you know just like stuff that if you were in any other

09:23.920 --> 09:27.920
state you'd probably be able to get and then of course every year their thing is

09:27.920 --> 09:33.040
that they try to light off more and more ground flowers each year so like last

09:33.040 --> 09:39.040
year I think they lit off like 400 ground flowers I mean it was the funniest

09:39.040 --> 09:42.960
we saw it and now I have to describe for those don't know the ground flowers I

09:42.960 --> 09:46.080
mean everybody's probably seen these even even in places where fireworks are

09:46.080 --> 09:49.960
legal these things are cool like you light them and they go and they start

09:49.960 --> 09:53.000
like red and then they turn green and they shake on the ground and spin around

09:53.000 --> 09:56.840
you can't get those anymore huh did they finally ban them no I don't think so

09:56.840 --> 10:01.000
really we didn't have any this year they're around okay yeah so they have

10:01.000 --> 10:06.920
those and they try their thing was as a you know big group or party and stuff

10:06.920 --> 10:10.240
they tried to light off more and more each year I think the year we went they

10:10.240 --> 10:15.200
were doing like 250 I mean it's been getting more and more this was many

10:15.200 --> 10:19.860
years ago but it was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen it literally was a

10:19.860 --> 10:24.680
pile that they meticulously you know stacked up and you know tide fuses

10:24.680 --> 10:30.940
together and all sorts of crazy stuff and it was the loudest buzzing just like

10:30.940 --> 10:37.480
the whole street is just full of smoke and like lights in it it's so like

10:37.480 --> 10:41.880
breathtaking you just can't stop you have to like bust out laughing because

10:41.880 --> 10:44.960
it's the most ridiculous thing you've ever used wanted to cry it was so

10:44.960 --> 10:49.540
amazing it was it was crazy I wish we had video of it but it's that sounds

10:49.540 --> 10:53.320
like you know how like you'll spend like all day setting up dominoes for just

10:53.320 --> 10:57.280
that one minute thrill when you knock them all over basically exactly what it

10:57.280 --> 11:03.080
sounds like to me it's gotten so big now that like you know they literally have

11:03.080 --> 11:07.720
like four or five piles of this stuff and it like by the time it's done it's

11:07.720 --> 11:12.520
just like there's like a block radius of justice ground flowers just left it the

11:12.520 --> 11:20.920
whole ground flower bomb pretty much it's awesome nice that's amazing a lot

11:20.920 --> 11:22.240
of fun

11:22.240 --> 11:25.720
alright well hey we're at we talked a lot about fire and fireworks and I'm

11:25.720 --> 11:29.080
sure the kids love that but let's talk about video games a little bit with how

11:29.080 --> 11:30.040
was your gaming week

11:30.040 --> 11:34.400
Loki how was your gaming week I didn't play much I played of course the usual

11:34.400 --> 11:39.160
hacked Grand Theft Auto 4 and yes I have people requesting you know that I play

11:39.160 --> 11:44.640
with them and stuff online I can't play with you guys online because our new

11:44.640 --> 11:48.720
systems are modded so we have a special version of it and it just wouldn't work

11:48.720 --> 11:53.920
I mean we have items that I've created and who knows if it crashed the game if

11:53.920 --> 11:57.600
I tried playing with you guys most likely you would have you be seen as

11:57.600 --> 12:00.480
firing off all these crazy weapons and you wouldn't be able to do that because

12:00.480 --> 12:05.040
it's just the way it works so you know not to and also the other thing our work

12:05.040 --> 12:08.200
games we don't invite other people in it's just the four of us or three of us

12:08.200 --> 12:13.160
or whoever's playing that's just the way it is but um so it's not hurt not that

12:13.160 --> 12:16.240
I'm trying to ignore anybody I'm just saying that people have been asking me

12:16.240 --> 12:20.320
to invite him it's just like yeah I can't do that so sorry

12:20.320 --> 12:24.280
anyways so beyond that stuff it's just getting crazy just you just stuck up

12:24.280 --> 12:28.440
just a minute you just stuck I'm not stuck up I play with other people but

12:28.440 --> 12:35.840
um let's see here then also I've been playing I tried angry berry I finally

12:35.840 --> 12:39.680
got to work I found out that it actually wasn't the game broken it was actually

12:39.680 --> 12:45.920
our internet at work is kind of it's got a weird firewall on it they have us was

12:45.920 --> 12:52.000
the 80s 86 3000 or something like that it's some weird web filter that they

12:52.000 --> 12:56.440
have well they've only like unblock certain ports or something so for

12:56.440 --> 13:01.880
whatever reason like we can play live but like the community game stuff

13:01.880 --> 13:05.080
doesn't work because community games whether you guys know it or not you

13:05.080 --> 13:08.040
actually have to be connected to live to use any of the community games even if

13:08.040 --> 13:11.520
you bottom and they're on your system you have to connect to live in order for

13:11.520 --> 13:15.120
it to work that's kind of like what happens with an Xbox Live arcade game if

13:15.120 --> 13:18.520
you're not on your own console that you bought it on the air under your account

13:18.520 --> 13:23.640
it'll kind of check live first exactly sounds like that but you know I these

13:23.640 --> 13:27.680
are the consoles I bought it or it's the games I bought on this console so it's

13:27.680 --> 13:31.560
kind of annoying so for you know I didn't realize this but at work I was

13:31.560 --> 13:35.200
getting this weird error message and it's weird too because other community

13:35.200 --> 13:40.280
games I've gotten have worked just fine but maybe I wasn't like maybe they

13:40.280 --> 13:43.760
changed something or whatever because I played a carny vale and that was kind of

13:43.760 --> 13:49.600
fun but anyways so angry berry for whatever reason didn't work at work but

13:49.600 --> 13:52.920
then I tried it again at home I redownloaded and everything and it works

13:52.920 --> 13:56.280
fine so I played a little bit of that and that game is absolutely crazy and

13:56.280 --> 14:00.600
very very hard and just absolutely ridiculous with you know smashing old

14:00.600 --> 14:04.400
women with buses and all sorts of crazy stuff we talked about this a few shows

14:04.400 --> 14:07.080
back by the way if you have no idea what he's talking about yeah it's a fighting

14:07.080 --> 14:11.200
game where you are Barack Obama yes you're very you're Barack Obama and it's

14:11.200 --> 14:15.520
got it's got like all sorts of crazy like enemies and stuff and all sorts of

14:15.520 --> 14:20.120
political references so it's great so definitely we're checking out things

14:20.120 --> 14:24.040
only like 400 Microsoft points so I think it's worth that I would like to

14:24.040 --> 14:26.960
see a game like this but with Sarah Palin I think it would be very funny

14:26.960 --> 14:29.560
especially now that she's not going to be the governor of Alaska anymore if

14:29.560 --> 14:33.000
you've been watching the news at all this week I you know what else is you

14:33.000 --> 14:37.520
going to do in her spare time but save save the world from crime that would be

14:37.520 --> 14:43.240
funny and then other than that I actually played some more fuel this week

14:43.240 --> 14:49.000
and tried the online stuff you know there really is no one online I did see

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
Rob online but you know it just so happened like he'd be in a race when I

14:53.000 --> 14:56.560
was doing the free mode and then I'd go into a race because he was you know in a

14:56.560 --> 14:59.760
race and then he'd be doing free mode and it's just this wasn't working out

14:59.760 --> 15:03.280
but I mean I don't even know how exactly that works if it's like fable to where

15:03.280 --> 15:06.480
like I have to drive to your location actually find you I'm sure you do

15:06.480 --> 15:11.560
because that would be annoying and I don't know where anybody is so oh well

15:11.560 --> 15:15.520
but the game is fun and you know now that I figured out how to cheat and

15:15.520 --> 15:19.080
teleport different spots on the map to get different vista points and stuff it

15:19.080 --> 15:22.560
makes it nice and easy but there was funny though because the first section

15:22.560 --> 15:27.200
of the game the first little region that you're in I didn't realize that I've

15:27.200 --> 15:30.280
only done one page of the challenges I'm like what the hell oh why is this

15:30.280 --> 15:34.200
challenge say I'm not done I'm like I've done all six of them I'm like oh there's

15:34.200 --> 15:41.280
a page over whoops damn it so I went by the way that happens with races too in

15:41.280 --> 15:45.400
the second area in tsunami zone or whatever it's called there's six races

15:45.400 --> 15:51.320
not three so just watch out for that okay why can't we put more once you get

15:51.320 --> 15:55.800
fooled I don't know why they did it that way but it's important and as the tsunami

15:55.800 --> 16:00.600
reef or what I think it's what's called tsunami reef because those races not

16:00.600 --> 16:05.560
only will unlock you get your challenge Doppler the livery Doppler but you also

16:05.560 --> 16:09.840
get three cars that are new cars when you run into them you unlock a vehicle

16:09.840 --> 16:12.600
so it's important to play all those races if you want to get all the

16:12.600 --> 16:16.400
vehicles yeah I do because I'm actually tired of driving as the one side I did

16:16.400 --> 16:20.400
all those unlock codes for different vehicles nice they're kind of it but I

16:20.400 --> 16:26.000
like the clothing so I kept the clothing but um yeah it's so fun and actually you

16:26.000 --> 16:28.740
know I really wish I had more time to play because I would be playing it a lot

16:28.740 --> 16:35.520
more but I've been busy with that and other things yeah and still haven't got

16:35.520 --> 16:39.200
a chance to play Wii Wii Sports Resort let me I get to this question from Jay

16:39.200 --> 16:42.240
rod in chat because you were talking about angry berry and it kind of brought

16:42.240 --> 16:45.760
up community games Jay rod wants to know are those community games free to

16:45.760 --> 16:51.180
download they're free to demo yes but they do cost money if you want to

16:51.180 --> 16:54.520
actually buy the registered version it's just like Xbox Live Arcade so the

16:54.520 --> 16:57.840
community games tend to be a lot cheaper and I mean the lowest price on the

16:57.840 --> 17:01.640
community games 200 Microsoft points and another thing too I haven't really gotten

17:01.640 --> 17:07.200
a chance to play around to get the new like kind of game making program kodu is

17:07.200 --> 17:11.320
actually out now and 400 Microsoft points five bucks for a game that you

17:11.320 --> 17:14.840
can make games in and send them to your friends and share stuff like that

17:14.840 --> 17:21.560
excellent deal so definitely check that out very cool anything else for your

17:21.560 --> 17:24.960
gaming week that's it you know I don't really have a lot to share with my

17:24.960 --> 17:27.480
gaming week I haven't really played a whole lot of new games I'm almost

17:27.480 --> 17:31.160
embarrassed to admit I've been playing a lot of Facebook games this week I know I

17:31.160 --> 17:35.640
know I should hang my head in shame all the credibility I had as a gamer is kind

17:35.640 --> 17:39.080
of shot but I don't know I've just been addicted to those crappy little Facebook

17:39.080 --> 17:41.880
games I've been oh god I don't even know if I really want to admit this but I've

17:41.880 --> 17:47.400
been playing one called sorority life sorority yes shut up it's like oh yeah I

17:47.400 --> 17:51.640
did it's like something it's like mafia but it's a sorority fight it's something

17:51.640 --> 17:54.720
my boyfriend got me hooked on but it's it's got all these little mini games to

17:54.720 --> 17:58.840
like bejeweled and stuff I think here's what it is you know how I quit the MMOs

17:58.840 --> 18:04.480
I think I have this inherent need to be leveling something like I'm leveling a

18:04.480 --> 18:08.400
character in this stupid-ass sorority life game like all of three I don't know

18:08.400 --> 18:11.200
I need to I do I need to go play something else like that but keep in

18:11.200 --> 18:15.600
mind also I have a roommate so I can't have the TV whenever I want a period so

18:15.600 --> 18:18.920
keep in mind that's a big reason why I don't always play like Xbox games and

18:18.920 --> 18:24.160
you get a VGA cable for making for my monitor yeah I'm maybe I do maybe that

18:24.160 --> 18:27.520
is something I did my computer all the time that's all I really play my 360

18:27.520 --> 18:30.280
well here's something else I don't want to get teased too much I didn't play all

18:30.280 --> 18:33.280
those Facebook games all week although I did play some more legitimate things

18:33.280 --> 18:37.160
like bejeweled and text twist and they have UNO on Facebook now I don't know if

18:37.160 --> 18:40.280
you're aware but they have UNO on Facebook that is similar to the Xbox

18:40.280 --> 18:44.520
live one except you instead of seeing like webcams you're seeing people's

18:44.520 --> 18:47.200
little Facebook icons and you're in a little chat room so you can actually

18:47.200 --> 18:52.880
play UNO so you know I was checking a lot of that out this week but I also got

18:52.880 --> 18:56.920
a new laptop this week fries on a really good deal on laptops this weekend

18:56.920 --> 19:00.100
because it's 4th of July and all that stuff so I actually went and got a new

19:00.100 --> 19:05.960
laptop it's a Toshiba so it's not a bad brand 2 gigahertz machine 3 gigs of RAM

19:05.960 --> 19:10.400
separate video card inside it's not like an onboard video it's got a separated

19:10.400 --> 19:17.240
video card $399.99 for his laptop I know it's a sweet deal but what's also sweet

19:17.240 --> 19:21.080
about it here's where the rest of my gaming week comes into play because now

19:21.080 --> 19:24.840
it's back to a 32-bit operating system since I don't have so much RAM or what

19:24.840 --> 19:29.080
have you I can play game tap games again so I actually spent some time playing

19:29.080 --> 19:32.520
civilization 4 because I missed it and that was one of the big games I would

19:32.520 --> 19:36.640
play through game tap so I know I let out a lot of game tap hate on a previous

19:36.640 --> 19:40.760
show because it would not work with my Windows Vista 64-bit but now I'm running

19:40.760 --> 19:45.760
Windows 7 and yeah I installed the release candidate that we all got at e3

19:45.760 --> 19:49.480
I decided you know what since I have a new laptop kind of like a fresh start

19:49.480 --> 19:54.280
when better time to upgrade my OS so I upgraded to Windows 7 I haven't played

19:54.280 --> 19:57.960
enough games on it yet I'm not familiar enough with the operating system yet I

19:57.960 --> 20:03.320
do like it seems to be a faster version of Vista but without all the stuff that

20:03.320 --> 20:06.920
made Vista so annoying like it's not asking me like 50 times I'm saying there

20:06.920 --> 20:10.120
are you sure you want to install this so-and-so wants to access your computer

20:10.120 --> 20:14.480
it's only done that when I've installed stuff otherwise it leaves me alone and

20:14.480 --> 20:18.720
it's it's so much easier to turn off the warning messages and stuff so that was

20:18.720 --> 20:21.960
one big improvement I noticed right off the bat I do think Windows 7 will be

20:21.960 --> 20:26.120
better than Vista that's for sure better than XP I don't know still too

20:26.120 --> 20:29.880
early to tell I do like though here's the one huge thing I noticed if I can

20:29.880 --> 20:34.960
talk operating systems for a minute instead of having all your windows at

20:34.960 --> 20:38.720
the bottom like you know how like right now you can see okay I have Firefox open

20:38.720 --> 20:42.920
IRC Adobe Audition the mixer and all this stuff that you see there okay

20:42.920 --> 20:46.280
instead of it that imagine that what would happen is that you'd see the

20:46.280 --> 20:50.480
little icon in the quick launch bar that you had on XP and it's just like it's a

20:50.480 --> 20:53.880
different color like the button looks raised because you have windows open and

20:53.880 --> 20:56.960
then when you hover over the raised button you see little previews of all

20:56.960 --> 21:01.040
the windows that's another huge change in Windows 7 so you save so much real

21:01.040 --> 21:04.280
estate on the bottom of the screen with all your windows open at once that was

21:04.280 --> 21:08.800
pretty cool so I'm noticing little things here and there but being able to

21:08.800 --> 21:12.960
play all the old computer games I was missing from not having game tap work on

21:12.960 --> 21:16.840
a newer OS was was kind of nice so that's cool I'm happy about that

21:16.840 --> 21:21.040
rama in our chat room says Windows 7 release candidate will expire after a

21:21.040 --> 21:25.000
year yes I'm aware that the two-hour shutdowns begin in March 2010 but look

21:25.000 --> 21:31.280
that's March 2010 still a heck of a long ways away and apparently my laptop comes

21:31.280 --> 21:34.240
with some type of free upgrade to Windows 7 anyway because I have like

21:34.240 --> 21:38.000
Vista premium came with it I don't know they were telling me this at fries like

21:38.000 --> 21:42.280
if I send them there is a thing that you can up it's it's gonna either be free or

21:42.280 --> 21:46.480
a small fee I wouldn't even mind paying a small fee honestly but I you know if I

21:46.480 --> 21:50.800
contact the manufacturer I has held on to my receipt so I can get the seven

21:50.800 --> 21:54.960
free cuz I'm I'm sure I will prefer seven to Vista I can already tell I

21:54.960 --> 21:58.360
prefer seven I just feel weird if I bought an operating system so I'm gonna

21:58.360 --> 22:02.280
hold out for the pirated version look if your laptop comes with it for free I

22:02.280 --> 22:07.600
mean oh yeah you know so I'm entitled to it right it's not a piracy thing it's it

22:07.600 --> 22:12.240
came with my laptop no I'm thinking about my computer that's you so there

22:12.240 --> 22:15.760
you go it's not that I don't want to pay for it it's just I don't want to pay for

22:15.760 --> 22:20.160
it yeah Rama and chat says don't worry you get a free upgrade and let's see

22:20.160 --> 22:23.960
Tiger class says the deals you see about home being 49 and professional being 99

22:23.960 --> 22:28.120
it's for those about pcs with a Vista that's interesting because that means

22:28.120 --> 22:34.600
that that means it's kind of like an apology for Windows Vista Rama and chat

22:34.600 --> 22:38.240
goes on as of last Friday when you buy any computer you get a low cost or free

22:38.240 --> 22:41.440
upgrade for seven that's awesome I picked a great time to upgrade didn't I

22:41.440 --> 22:47.600
whoo nice so I was happy with my laptop purchase I'm telling you if you're in

22:47.600 --> 22:51.000
the market for new computers right now that's a great time especially the

22:51.000 --> 22:53.840
economy being the way it is and everything people or the you can find

22:53.840 --> 22:58.800
some dirt cheap sales you know I've and I believe me I found those netbooks

22:58.800 --> 23:02.760
tempting for like 200 250 dollars but seriously just spending another like

23:02.760 --> 23:08.480
150 getting a nice nice system I'm very happy with my purchase and think about

23:08.480 --> 23:13.360
it that is the cost of a PlayStation 3 and only 150 dollars more than the cost

23:13.360 --> 23:17.800
of a PSP go I was listening to a old episode or a lot when I say old I mean

23:17.800 --> 23:21.240
just a couple weeks old we were kind of in that debate about the PSP go and how

23:21.240 --> 23:24.840
Sony is absolutely being idiotic with their price points it's what's killing

23:24.840 --> 23:29.640
that generation 49 I mean the 249 can buy you a freaking laptop and we talk

23:29.640 --> 23:35.040
about how you know PSP's are cool because they can do music and games and

23:35.040 --> 23:38.320
you know kind of the thing all the things that a laptop can do well guess

23:38.320 --> 23:44.720
what Sony a laptop costs as much as you're charging for your PSP go I this

23:44.720 --> 23:48.880
whoever that was it's so frustrating because it's not that they're bad

23:48.880 --> 23:53.400
systems it's just the Sony's getting it's just like when I remember the

23:53.400 --> 23:56.960
PlayStation 3 everybody was like you know they're showing you know the system

23:56.960 --> 24:00.400
everything and it was like yeah this looks awesome this is gonna be sweet you

24:00.400 --> 24:09.720
know and then they're like oh and it's gonna be 599 you're like dah you stupid

24:09.720 --> 24:14.120
you know what at least I'll give them the fact that they did have blu-ray

24:14.120 --> 24:17.720
which at the time was an expensive technology it was fine yeah hella

24:17.720 --> 24:21.680
fucking risky for them because at that time a winner had not been declared in

24:21.680 --> 24:26.160
the HD DVD blu-ray war but to their credit and I'll give credit where

24:26.160 --> 24:29.320
credits do I give Sony a hard time and I'll give them a good time when they do

24:29.320 --> 24:32.920
things that are right they they were right they they were lucked out with

24:32.920 --> 24:35.700
this blu-ray thing they want to say lucked out but they won out with this

24:35.700 --> 24:39.600
blu-ray thing and that's gonna be a huge asset to them as this generation

24:39.600 --> 24:43.360
continues I think you will see more people that decide oh I need to get a

24:43.360 --> 24:47.360
blu-ray player why don't I just get a PlayStation 3 just like people said last

24:47.360 --> 24:49.960
time I need to get a DVD player well I'll just get the PlayStation 2 because

24:49.960 --> 24:54.760
it plays games you know my significant other has a PlayStation 2 doesn't play

24:54.760 --> 24:58.720
like any video games on it uses it as a DVD player there are a lot of people out

24:58.720 --> 25:03.760
there like that like that that will buy it as a player but kind of knowing

25:03.760 --> 25:06.680
that oh well you know if I wanted to play games on it or had somebody

25:06.680 --> 25:09.840
entertain I could it's good but see that's the thing though is that's good

25:09.840 --> 25:14.440
to increase your install base but when you look at you know something like that

25:14.440 --> 25:19.600
then think about all the people that did buy it for mainly a blu-ray player their

25:19.600 --> 25:24.180
number is already you know for being in third place aren't that great and if you

25:24.180 --> 25:28.260
take off you know X amount of percentage of that you know saying that these

25:28.260 --> 25:32.520
people are only going to be using it for mainly a blu-ray player that's really

25:32.520 --> 25:36.660
not good you know and they were kind of hoping that they would get a little bit

25:36.660 --> 25:41.940
of a bump from you know people buying it as a cheap blu-ray player but it's not

25:41.940 --> 25:46.440
working out for them Marissa con gusto and chat makes an interesting comment

25:46.440 --> 25:49.720
chat that orange laundry calm if you want to join us live on this Sunday

25:49.720 --> 25:54.060
evening as we tape at all games calm Marissa says I was talking about the

25:54.060 --> 25:57.800
economy with new game prices the other day with a friend the prices have gone

25:57.800 --> 26:02.760
down over the years recollecting that if a new game was $60 in 1993 for me but I

26:02.760 --> 26:05.820
still wonder if the new titles can command the same opening price with the

26:05.820 --> 26:10.080
unemployment rate skyrocketing well and somebody followed up in chat with Sony

26:10.080 --> 26:15.420
sure hope so I to some extent they do say that even in a recession people will

26:15.420 --> 26:19.600
not neglect their entertainment I mean look at movies transformers did

26:19.600 --> 26:23.820
extraordinarily well at the box office even with the fact that tickets cost

26:23.820 --> 26:28.480
like 1025 a pop now me movies are freaking expensive but transformers had

26:28.480 --> 26:31.680
what the second best weekend only to the dark night I mean it's still huge

26:31.680 --> 26:35.320
business you know it's there's a lot of freaking money a lot of people want to

26:35.320 --> 26:38.100
see a movie a lot of people aren't willing to sacrifice you know

26:38.100 --> 26:41.280
entertainment I mean they've made cuts throughout their life you know in

26:41.280 --> 26:45.880
different aspects of everything and they want a little bit of a kind of a treat

26:45.880 --> 26:50.400
for themselves for you know cutting to suffer yeah pretty much yeah I mean and

26:50.400 --> 26:53.960
you know they can still afford to go to movies it's just you know what you got

26:53.960 --> 26:57.000
to be smarter about if you really want to pay you know they go see a movie

26:57.000 --> 27:00.840
don't buy the popcorn and soda there go see a matinee there you go you save

27:00.840 --> 27:05.280
yourself a ton of money because it's just that the you know concession prices

27:05.280 --> 27:09.360
are so expensive and the movie prices are pretty or go to the drive-in damn oh

27:09.360 --> 27:12.720
yeah and save it the drive-in with the double features and bring it in your own

27:12.720 --> 27:18.000
crap in the backseat and everything and hell yeah yeah the pride I'm surprised

27:18.000 --> 27:21.360
the drive-ins do not thrive in an economy like this well you notice

27:21.360 --> 27:24.720
member they are talking about closing the drive-in that we have in Sacramento

27:24.720 --> 27:27.760
here for a while I always do they are every year they're talking about oh

27:27.760 --> 27:32.840
they're talking about let's put in a 25 screen theater well because they could

27:32.840 --> 27:36.120
charge more exactly that doesn't mean they'll have the business for fixing the

27:36.120 --> 27:39.600
drive-in charge more for that charge a little more anyway sorry we're getting a

27:39.600 --> 27:44.600
little bit off topic but let's see alpha kenanagram and Chad is hoping

27:44.600 --> 27:48.640
believing the Ars Technica mole is right about the ps3 price drop in ps3 slim

27:48.640 --> 27:53.360
since a lot of great 80 gigabyte bundles are going to sell with Wally LBP a

27:53.360 --> 27:57.720
little big planet bundle and Metal Gear Solid 4 Killzone 2 bundle I don't know I

27:57.720 --> 28:00.360
guess we'll get into some of the Sony news in just a little bit here when we

28:00.360 --> 28:04.000
get into the news tonight but I I wanted to say though quickly about Sony and the

28:04.000 --> 28:08.200
PSP go I think whereas people are willing to make sacrifices to their

28:08.200 --> 28:13.760
entertainment there's a limit and I predict as I'm sure many of you do but I

28:13.760 --> 28:18.440
I'm willing to kind of put it all out there I fully predict the PSP go is

28:18.440 --> 28:23.800
going to tank and I'm not talking about like not not it's not just going to not

28:23.800 --> 28:28.040
sell it's going to not sell horrifically like it is going to be an embarrassment

28:28.040 --> 28:32.160
to Sony as I would predict the PSP go and it's all based off that price point

28:32.160 --> 28:35.200
because when you put one of those puppies on the shelf next to a Nintendo

28:35.200 --> 28:41.960
DSi that's only or an iPhone 40 or an iPhone that's $99 I'm sorry what does

28:41.960 --> 28:46.840
Sony have to justify that PSP go with not a lot and I'm sorry fanboys I know

28:46.840 --> 28:50.560
you got your games and I know you got your multi stuff that you can do in

28:50.560 --> 28:55.000
there I'm sorry it is not just now they did say and then you know I know this

28:55.000 --> 28:58.160
doesn't justify anything they did say that the processor is going to be four

28:58.160 --> 29:03.880
times you know it's going to be a little bit faster so would be the average gamer

29:03.880 --> 29:07.320
does not give two shits I didn't say they're not going to sell any of those

29:07.320 --> 29:11.000
things well yeah there's plenty of Sony fanboys that'll be forking over the

29:11.000 --> 29:14.720
money but it's going to be an embarrassment they're going to have to

29:14.720 --> 29:18.200
cut the price and make they're going to have to that they will there will be

29:18.200 --> 29:23.800
damage control by the even once it seems to be out like August October well then

29:23.800 --> 29:27.200
by then they won't do they won't be able to fix it in time for this year's

29:27.200 --> 29:31.440
holidays but next next year for the holidays it's going to be a well

29:31.440 --> 29:35.160
especially you know they've got you know the PSP 3000 still out there now if you

29:35.160 --> 29:39.960
really want to PSP you know if you think about it huh let's see here I can buy

29:39.960 --> 29:46.920
this PSP system that's $100 cheaper and you know get 16 gigabytes of storage or

29:46.920 --> 29:52.280
whatever for that for probably a lot less than $100 so there you go you save

29:52.280 --> 29:57.720
money right there amazed at suman chat asks sky tank worse than the GBA micro

29:57.720 --> 30:01.920
I think actually that's not a bad comparison because that was a dumb idea

30:01.920 --> 30:05.680
to you know I think it was one of those things is like oh how cute you know

30:05.680 --> 30:10.120
little tiny gameboy but like in practicalness you know come on those GBA

30:10.120 --> 30:13.200
micros are a little silly I think this is actually worse because the reason why

30:13.200 --> 30:18.000
is you're you're basically saying to your retailers okay you need to sell

30:18.000 --> 30:22.040
these and the retailers are going well why because then this is basically a

30:22.040 --> 30:25.700
system that you can only download games for it and you're not letting me sell

30:25.700 --> 30:29.200
Neil vouchers for these games and stuff so why should I push your product and

30:29.200 --> 30:32.520
that's really what's come down to it like I have some my cell through stores

30:32.520 --> 30:36.120
that I deal with they're like I'll bring in a couple because people are going to

30:36.120 --> 30:39.600
want them but that's it I'm not going to you know push these things at all

30:39.600 --> 30:46.880
because why should I they're cut into my sales yeah I this is just going to be an

30:46.880 --> 30:50.160
embarrassment it's going to set digital distribution for games back a couple

30:50.160 --> 30:53.640
years single-handedly because then Sony's going to blame it on that that

30:53.640 --> 30:56.360
people aren't ready for digital distribution no blame it on your price

30:56.360 --> 31:01.800
and the fact that it's a system without a UMD drive should be cheaper see what

31:01.800 --> 31:07.280
happened with the price you know before with the PlayStation 3 hello come on I

31:07.280 --> 31:11.360
mean did you not learn from that at all I want to spend this whole show bitching

31:11.360 --> 31:14.200
about Sony's price point because we've done it before but it's just it's just

31:14.200 --> 31:19.520
frustrating as somebody who who wants to see the good in Sony and wants to see a

31:19.520 --> 31:23.480
lot of the good stuff they have on the horizon to just watch them literally

31:23.480 --> 31:28.480
literally take out a gun pointed at their foot and pull the trigger to watch

31:28.480 --> 31:33.000
them literally do this in front of our eyes is frustrating as a gamer I'm sorry

31:33.000 --> 31:39.120
as someone who tries very hard to see the good in Sony yeah anyhow let's get

31:39.120 --> 31:42.600
into some gaming news I don't really have a lot for housekeeping tonight

31:42.600 --> 31:48.000
visit us on Twitter at olr send us emails at mailbag orange laundry calm etc

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
etc Loki go ahead yes so actually I was gonna say you know we can talk a little

31:54.000 --> 31:58.360
bit about those bundles that they had there's actually two different bundles

31:58.360 --> 32:01.440
that are available now for a gig system which is kind of funny because they're

32:01.440 --> 32:05.080
like kind of clearing them out you know because everybody thinks oh they're

32:05.080 --> 32:08.400
gonna come out with some new 160 gig systems or something like that that

32:08.400 --> 32:15.680
kind of goes back into what the Ars Technica mole said that the like a

32:15.680 --> 32:23.000
slimmer ps3 will be coming out actually as soon as August and there's a Taiwanese

32:23.000 --> 32:29.640
firm that said they've been awarded the manufacturing contracts for this ps3

32:29.640 --> 32:35.880
slim system and apparently you know Engadget Chinese they reported that the

32:35.880 --> 32:39.840
two Taiwanese manufacturing companies have been awarded contracts to build

32:39.840 --> 32:46.440
Sony's new streamlined ps3 and according to udn.com half the orders have gone to

32:46.440 --> 32:53.080
Taiwanese group Foxconn and the other half have gone to pigotron wasn't a

32:53.080 --> 32:56.640
Taiwanese lawyer that tried to cease and desist the early images of the ps3

32:56.640 --> 33:04.520
box to yes it was and apparently you know these were the manufacturers that

33:04.520 --> 33:11.560
have I think manufactured the original ps3 so it makes sense and you know they

33:11.560 --> 33:15.200
also said that the timing makes sense the rumor that it's gonna be released

33:15.200 --> 33:21.200
in August because in Japan they actually have more console sales during the

33:21.200 --> 33:26.480
summer as opposed to you know the holiday season for you know us in the

33:26.480 --> 33:31.920
United States and Canada so you know it makes sense maybe that they're trying to

33:31.920 --> 33:35.680
sell off all these you know ps3 80 gig systems to kind of clean out their

33:35.680 --> 33:40.400
inventory and they're doing these kind of bundles to you know push out some

33:40.400 --> 33:45.760
more systems to kind of make space for this new system which who knows maybe

33:45.760 --> 33:51.960
going into our next story you know with the whole emulation thing so tell us a

33:51.960 --> 33:54.520
little more about the emulation thing then so if you're gonna if you're gonna

33:54.520 --> 33:57.880
open that worms let's talk about it definitely I mean if you think about okay

33:57.880 --> 34:02.800
why would I need a ps3 you know slim system when I have you know ps3 well

34:02.800 --> 34:08.160
there's rumors now that they may be you know bringing back the emulation this is

34:08.160 --> 34:14.240
coming from the fact that there has been a new patent filed I guess back in

34:14.240 --> 34:19.960
December you know I'm talking about full emulation of the emotion engine and the

34:19.960 --> 34:24.440
motion engine was the chipset that they had in the PlayStation 2 it's basically

34:24.440 --> 34:29.560
what you had in the no launch ps3 systems that allowed you to play the

34:29.560 --> 34:35.000
PlayStation 2 games and then of course they took out one of those two chips

34:35.000 --> 34:39.320
for the 80 gig system that was with Metal Gear Solid 4 and they were doing

34:39.320 --> 34:42.440
some of that with software emulation then later on they took out all the

34:42.440 --> 34:48.160
chips and so now you know you have no emulation but you know like they did

34:48.160 --> 34:52.000
with the PlayStation 1 PlayStation 1 is completely you know software emulated

34:52.000 --> 34:56.960
and you can play your discs and you can download PlayStation 1 games so you

34:56.960 --> 35:00.080
better believe it that they're probably gonna have PlayStation 2 game downloads

35:00.080 --> 35:03.880
here's my thing though are they really gonna you know patches in allow

35:03.880 --> 35:07.000
everybody to play their PlayStation 2 games or are they just gonna really

35:07.000 --> 35:12.040
strictly leave this as software emulation for the titles that are

35:12.040 --> 35:15.880
downloaded so that you have to buy your games again do they want to piss me off

35:15.880 --> 35:21.400
or not is basically the question that's out on the table I would hope if the

35:21.400 --> 35:24.560
emulation is being built in there to play these old games and put them out

35:24.560 --> 35:27.880
there on the service which makes a lot of sense as to why why now why this is

35:27.880 --> 35:32.000
happening especially with digital distribution being so big maybe the PSP

35:32.000 --> 35:35.440
go will leave because if this thing has a faster processor right you said the

35:35.440 --> 35:38.840
process for maybe these PSP goes are gonna be armed to play the PlayStation

35:38.840 --> 35:43.080
it's not gonna work because the the patents actually for the cell processor

35:43.080 --> 35:47.600
to interpret okay so it's never mind you know unless they're shoving the micro

35:47.600 --> 35:51.640
cell processor in the PSP go which not gonna happen all right so that train to

35:51.640 --> 35:55.760
rail never mind so but if they're gonna do this whole thing with you know the

35:55.760 --> 36:01.240
PlayStation 3 it's obvious that they could easily open it up so that image

36:01.240 --> 36:04.640
is just like PlayStation 1 I can put a PlayStation 1 disk in my PlayStation 3

36:04.640 --> 36:07.760
and play it there's no I mean people forget it is backwards compatible

36:07.760 --> 36:13.400
PlayStation 1 but just not PlayStation 2 which you know is is noticeably missing

36:13.400 --> 36:16.640
from the newer models anyway which I think most people have I don't have a

36:16.640 --> 36:20.440
model I think play the old stuff see that's the thing it's like how greedy

36:20.440 --> 36:23.920
are they is what might the real question that we need to be asking them because

36:23.920 --> 36:28.280
they want the PlayStation 2 this still sell well they dropped it down to $99

36:28.280 --> 36:31.520
and they still care about that system because it's still selling pretty well

36:31.520 --> 36:38.240
sometimes outselling the PlayStation 3 but are they going to be greedy enough

36:38.240 --> 36:42.040
to wear that when this does come out this you know if they do happen to

36:42.040 --> 36:46.840
release this you are they going to do it as a you know patch where it will allow

36:46.840 --> 36:50.080
you to play any PlayStation 2 game I think that would be good that would

36:50.080 --> 36:52.960
probably get a lot of their you know people that are pissed off at them off

36:52.960 --> 36:58.200
their backs and look really good in like a PR standpoint but if they are super

36:58.200 --> 37:02.000
greedy they may also say hey we're just gonna limited this to you know the games

37:02.000 --> 37:05.680
that you have to download so you have to rebuy the games you know because people

37:05.680 --> 37:09.960
like buying games from us and we can sell them I think that they should

37:09.960 --> 37:12.960
release it as a patch so that you can play whatever games you have because you

37:12.960 --> 37:16.560
know what people are still gonna buy the games and you especially games that they

37:16.560 --> 37:19.500
can't find anymore can you imagine downloading the original you know

37:19.500 --> 37:24.360
katamari or something like that I mean that'd be fun very interesting comment

37:24.360 --> 37:27.440
in the chat here at chat dot orange hundred dot com from game guru what do

37:27.440 --> 37:32.040
you think of this Loki I think Sony has to kill the PlayStation 2 and get the

37:32.040 --> 37:36.400
PlayStation 2 owners to move on that also makes sense because I think a lot

37:36.400 --> 37:39.600
of people are clinging to the PlayStation 2 and are upgrading well

37:39.600 --> 37:44.880
sure you put a $99 system next to a $399 system and people are you know the

37:44.880 --> 37:48.260
average consumer again that's just looking for something to entertain their

37:48.260 --> 37:53.000
9 and 10 year old is gonna go for the $99 system and also a lot of people are

37:53.000 --> 37:55.960
upgrading because they're a law I have all these PlayStation 2 games you know I

37:55.960 --> 37:59.720
don't want to buy a new system and not be able to play them which I never

37:59.720 --> 38:02.440
understood that argument the first place if you're buying a new system you still

38:02.440 --> 38:05.760
have your old system you can still play your old games it's not like that all

38:05.760 --> 38:10.600
sudden your new old system is just gonna vanish you know it's not gonna you know

38:10.600 --> 38:14.680
incinerate oh speaking as someone who stopped playing PlayStation 2 games on

38:14.680 --> 38:19.720
the PlayStation 3 came out a lot of times it's about space wires and just

38:19.720 --> 38:25.600
the convenience of it convenience is huge and to me owning a Wii and Xbox 360

38:25.600 --> 38:30.160
and a PlayStation 3 there's a lot of fucking cords behind my TV and it's a

38:30.160 --> 38:33.560
bit of a mess with all the different controllers all the different cables all

38:33.560 --> 38:36.960
the different shit I mean and then add into that rock band instruments and so

38:36.960 --> 38:40.520
forth my roommate probably just looks at this and goes my god this is so much

38:40.520 --> 38:45.080
shit you know he's kind of right and to throw into that oh now I'm gonna I want

38:45.080 --> 38:48.600
to whip out the PlayStation 2 and hook that up to and play that you know it's a

38:48.600 --> 38:53.200
lot you know but here we are in the house of dark soccer and Dan they have

38:53.200 --> 38:56.280
all these old systems they do whip them out once in a while and play all the old

38:56.280 --> 38:59.740
stuff but I think it takes a certain type of gamer for that again the average

38:59.740 --> 39:05.360
consumer I think gets annoyed with all the stuff to hook up yeah you know

39:05.360 --> 39:10.080
there's people keep this in mind guys you know I realize as gamers who

39:10.080 --> 39:13.360
probably download this podcast interested in the hardcore stuff there's

39:13.360 --> 39:16.560
a lot of people out there who don't even know how to hook this shit up to their

39:16.560 --> 39:21.160
TV they have to call somebody over to explain you maybe you've been called

39:21.160 --> 39:24.880
before think about it haven't you ever been called to install something like

39:24.880 --> 39:30.480
this like a VCR a DVD player a PlayStation onto somebody's TV or had to

39:30.480 --> 39:33.360
fix it because they didn't like a wire came out they didn't know what happened

39:33.360 --> 39:37.040
there's a lot of people that don't understand that stuff and the other

39:37.040 --> 39:43.160
thing too though it's kind of I mean presumptuous of them to assume that

39:43.160 --> 39:48.080
everybody that has a PlayStation 2 is gonna upgrade to a PlayStation 3 I think

39:48.080 --> 39:51.200
a lot of people have gotten tired of their shit and I've already upgraded to

39:51.200 --> 39:55.440
a Wii or well it's not really an upgrade but you know have gotten a Wii or have

39:55.440 --> 39:59.600
upgraded to like a 360 or something like that and you know I was one of those

39:59.600 --> 40:03.960
people I hated the Xbox fucking hated it I was very clear in the show that I

40:03.960 --> 40:10.080
absolutely Sony fanboy 100% me too and then when the Xbox 360 came out it was

40:10.080 --> 40:14.720
like okay well I'll get this in you know a PlayStation 3 later on but you know

40:14.720 --> 40:19.160
then PlayStation 3 came out and I was like I'm not paying $600 for this

40:19.160 --> 40:24.480
luckily you know I I go on for free so I didn't have to do that but you know if I

40:24.480 --> 40:29.680
didn't get for free I would not be buying it so I mean it's just it's

40:29.680 --> 40:34.080
really you know in Microsoft's really changed the way I think about them

40:34.080 --> 40:37.640
because you know with the Xbox is just like oh my god the system's huge it's

40:37.640 --> 40:42.360
like Microsoft learned from their mistakes Microsoft said oh okay you know

40:42.360 --> 40:45.360
we didn't cater enough to the role-playing game fans we didn't care

40:45.360 --> 40:49.320
enough to some of these audiences we were the casual gamer we're gonna try

40:49.320 --> 40:52.240
and fix those things didn't happen overnight but you really see that stuff

40:52.240 --> 40:56.440
starting to come together with a 360 Sony sat on their butt rested on their

40:56.440 --> 40:59.760
laurels a little bit and thought people were gonna pay a premium price because

40:59.760 --> 41:02.560
of blu-ray and all this stuff and they wouldn't really have to work into these

41:02.560 --> 41:05.200
features and now they're kind of having paying for it a little bit trying to

41:05.200 --> 41:08.040
play a little bit of catch-up which you know they're doing to make success

41:08.040 --> 41:12.880
Nintendo fucking smoked weed and made the system that came to them in their

41:12.880 --> 41:16.380
dream I don't know what they did but whatever they did worked like his

41:16.380 --> 41:20.280
Nintendo just woo the Wii was kind of an outer space remember we all first heard

41:20.280 --> 41:24.080
of that we were like fuck is this they redesigned the GameCube and made it you

41:24.080 --> 41:29.360
know with some wireless controllers is basically it you know more or less so I

41:29.360 --> 41:34.600
don't know yeah I'd be interested to see what happens but I have a feeling if

41:34.600 --> 41:36.840
there is going to be any sort of software emulation we're gonna see it

41:36.840 --> 41:42.120
probably by this fall j-rod interesting comments in chat here j-rod says I used

41:42.120 --> 41:46.080
to be all about my 360 but with Microsoft's piss-poor hardware quality

41:46.080 --> 41:50.440
I've moved on to a PlayStation 3 Rama says Microsoft doesn't have piss poor

41:50.440 --> 41:54.800
hardware quality they jumped the gun to beat Sony and I kind of agree with both

41:54.800 --> 41:58.280
of those comments that yeah you definitely noticed that the Microsoft

41:58.280 --> 42:03.240
has the harder higher hardware issue and honestly that system as a piece of

42:03.240 --> 42:11.720
hardware loud obnoxious not the most attractive thing in my living room but I

42:11.720 --> 42:16.680
deal with it because of all the things it provides that make sense I you know

42:16.680 --> 42:22.200
it's not actually for me the audio and the sound you know portion of this you

42:22.200 --> 42:25.260
know system as far as how loud is and stuff doesn't really bother me I have a

42:25.260 --> 42:31.000
computer that has countless amount of fans on it it's super loud and I really

42:31.000 --> 42:35.440
don't care I just don't even notice it anymore just totally tune it out but yes

42:35.440 --> 42:42.200
the yes the PlayStation 3 is immensely quiet you know compared to the 360

42:42.200 --> 42:48.160
definitely all right well let's move on to some more news and I think we'll

42:48.160 --> 42:52.240
continue talking about Sony news I want to talk about this some bundles and I

42:52.240 --> 42:55.720
think this to come up a little earlier a chatter I had mentioned this but I did

42:55.720 --> 42:58.320
just kind of want to reference this it was something we wanted to go over

42:58.320 --> 43:03.440
tonight is that there there does appear to be some new Sony bundles on the way

43:03.440 --> 43:07.440
apparently a Best Buy employee tipped off some of the blogs this week that

43:07.440 --> 43:11.640
there is an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 out there now it has copies of Metal

43:11.640 --> 43:16.680
Gear Solid 4 and Killzone 2 with it all for $400 so that's not too bad

43:16.680 --> 43:22.560
considering you're getting two big games there for $400 also apparently now I

43:22.560 --> 43:26.320
guess rumors are saying is that there's going to be another bundle that could

43:26.320 --> 43:30.240
have LittleBigPlanet I guess with it as well. Yeah they do have it there's one I

43:30.240 --> 43:34.480
think they do have it for LittleBigPlanet and WALL-E. The Blu-ray

43:34.480 --> 43:38.240
interesting that's especially interesting considering WALL-E isn't a

43:38.240 --> 43:42.600
Sony movie it's a Disney movie that's a that's a little weird to me you would

43:42.600 --> 43:45.960
think they would throw in a Sony movie why a kung fu panda or something well

43:45.960 --> 43:49.640
that's not so what I understand the need that you know they're obviously they're

43:49.640 --> 43:53.280
going for the family system but it's very interesting that it's a Disney

43:53.280 --> 43:57.720
movie like that sounds more like something Costco would do you know Costco

43:57.720 --> 44:00.360
bundles all this stuff together they don't need the manufacturer to do it

44:00.360 --> 44:05.440
very interesting but yeah those are some bundles I guess out there in the wild so

44:05.440 --> 44:10.080
they are trying to add more value to the PlayStation 3 so you know it's getting

44:10.080 --> 44:17.000
to be a little more reasonable. Definitely something that's not quite

44:17.000 --> 44:22.760
reasonable it's a little weird is GameStop they've had some they have three

44:22.760 --> 44:28.000
bundles that they have available as part of their Wii summer fun bundles and it's

44:28.000 --> 44:34.120
almost like a bad joke they literally have if you buy one of these bottles you

44:34.120 --> 44:41.060
can get a Wii bundled with a squirt gun, a Wii bundled with rubber duckies, or a Wii

44:41.060 --> 44:49.040
bundled with pirate tattoo arm sleeves. Why? I don't know but these are crappy

44:49.040 --> 44:52.440
little carnival gifts they're just throwing in with the Wii is that is that

44:52.440 --> 44:55.560
really going to motivate someone to go get Nintendo Wii? Oh I want to get the

44:55.560 --> 44:59.800
rubber ducky! It's absolutely crap because if you think about it I mean

44:59.800 --> 45:06.600
these are like dollar store toys I mean why would it's like oh you know I got to

45:06.600 --> 45:14.600
get a free water gun I mean it's a cheap ass water gun and you know that's the kind of

45:14.600 --> 45:18.280
thing now with like GameStop and you know a lot of these places you know a

45:18.280 --> 45:21.400
lot of people are like my customers I deal with you know bitching about

45:21.400 --> 45:26.360
GameStop having the exclusives for you know different content and stuff

45:26.360 --> 45:30.400
unlockables you know exclusive things like for example in the conduit they had

45:30.400 --> 45:36.180
you know the all-seeing eye was blue in the game that's it it just happened to

45:36.180 --> 45:43.160
be blue who cares you know it's like big whoop and this is kind of more like that

45:43.160 --> 45:47.480
it's like okay where the hell did you get these free water pistols for and why

45:47.480 --> 45:51.480
would you you know even think about bundling them with the Wii I mean why

45:51.480 --> 45:59.200
even bother it's just crap but I don't know huh I guess they're trying to give

45:59.200 --> 46:03.120
some added value to this but I'm not so sure value at all it's like take a dump

46:03.120 --> 46:06.840
and put it in a bag and throw it in there you worth more than that stuff I

46:06.840 --> 46:11.440
mean seriously it's just what the hell do you thinking the only thing it did

46:11.440 --> 46:15.240
successfully do for them is getting people to talk about on blogs and on

46:15.240 --> 46:20.920
this show because it's you know so asinine but that's not a positive that's

46:20.920 --> 46:24.240
not gonna make anybody go hey I want to go purchase that GameStop because they

46:24.240 --> 46:30.240
get crap with it I again I'm gonna go back to the Costco example Costco will

46:30.240 --> 46:33.920
bundle in useful things with these systems like a free game or something

46:33.920 --> 46:36.720
but now it's free sometimes you're paying a little more money you know the

46:36.720 --> 46:39.920
extra controller but you want to go bundles Costco is a good place to go

46:39.920 --> 46:43.840
there are some games out there they're absolute shit that seriously they could

46:43.840 --> 46:49.120
probably purchase for really really cheap and they could throw that in there

46:49.120 --> 46:53.680
and that would at least be something because it's least a game I can play

46:53.680 --> 46:58.120
with you know the Wii whereas pirate tattoo sleeves I have no idea what the

46:58.120 --> 47:04.080
hell I would use that for to be a pirate are alpha-kin anagram and chat says Rob

47:04.080 --> 47:08.120
you would probably be a great voice actor that's like my fucking dream job

47:08.120 --> 47:12.400
don't even joke I would love to do if there's anybody out there possibly at a

47:12.400 --> 47:17.560
game company that is creating a game you need cheap voice acting I will I would

47:17.560 --> 47:21.600
I will willingly be a voice actor in the game that's like my dream to do voice I

47:21.600 --> 47:26.480
don't even care it could be like rubber ducky hunter 2009 I'll still do the

47:26.480 --> 47:33.560
voice acting because I think that would be awesome so yeah it sounds like could

47:33.560 --> 47:39.720
be an interesting bundle I guess for me for crap lovers a nice try there but I

47:39.720 --> 47:42.800
think you're gonna need to like me I'll do something else too

47:42.800 --> 47:48.600
Oh Shermy wants to get out you might know hey Shermy Oh Shermy the cat has

47:48.600 --> 47:55.960
been hiding and I think sure me wants to get out but now sure he's afraid live on

47:55.960 --> 48:00.760
air radio these these things happen we have cat drama going on I think sure

48:00.760 --> 48:03.160
he's afraid now we'll just keep moving just leave the door open for a little

48:03.160 --> 48:09.160
bit hopefully it's sure me old sneak out when we're not looking I don't really

48:09.160 --> 48:11.760
have anything else I want to get into right this second well more stories yeah

48:11.760 --> 48:16.080
sure well since we're talking about the we you might not even have to buy a we

48:16.080 --> 48:19.640
because apparently the emulators for the we have been doing a pretty good job

48:19.640 --> 48:25.760
themselves in fact the dolphin emulator which salsa does the GameCube games as

48:25.760 --> 48:31.760
well has now gotten you know some games playable and also you know coming out in

48:31.760 --> 48:37.480
720 or 1080p so they're able to render the games a lot higher so that kind of

48:37.480 --> 48:44.560
gives you you know 16 16 times anti aliasing and they also had some other

48:44.560 --> 48:47.920
filters that are thrown on top of there but it kind of gives you an impression

48:47.920 --> 48:52.040
of what the we would look like if they came out with a we HD and honestly that

48:52.040 --> 48:55.480
kind of has me kind of excited for like a we HD if they were ever to do that

48:55.480 --> 48:59.840
because some of these games don't look bad actually rendered you know at a

48:59.840 --> 49:04.480
higher resolution and granted some textures are kind of I don't know low

49:04.480 --> 49:09.800
whereas but you know like mad world looks sweet super mario galaxy looks

49:09.800 --> 49:15.000
pretty awesome they had some other videos I saw of punch-out look pretty

49:15.000 --> 49:20.640
sweet but yeah there's a whole bunch of these and actually the emulator course

49:20.640 --> 49:24.840
is available now and you can check it out wait you can actually doubt that you

49:24.840 --> 49:29.520
could just put the we DVDs in your computer and play these games um I'm not

49:29.520 --> 49:32.760
sure if it reads it actually off the disk I'm not sure if you need like an ISO

49:32.760 --> 49:36.840
or something like that but I do know that it does support the we remote and

49:36.840 --> 49:41.040
none check if you happen to have like a Bluetooth adapter huh and this is just

49:41.040 --> 49:45.600
out there now it's out there now yeah and and the thing is endos not like

49:45.600 --> 49:49.840
worried about this and you also need a pretty I mean you need a decent computer

49:49.840 --> 49:55.200
to run it I mean granted your laptop would probably run this pretty well but

49:55.200 --> 49:57.320
like some of the ones that they're showing I think they're like 4 gig

49:57.320 --> 50:02.960
processors you know with 4 gigs of RAM you know pretty nice you know new

50:02.960 --> 50:08.080
graphics card and that kind of thing but still though I mean that's you know it

50:08.080 --> 50:12.400
leaves the door open because if you can emulate this stuff on a PC why not you

50:12.400 --> 50:17.000
know what is Shermey doing sure he's finding other places to hide I don't

50:17.000 --> 50:22.480
know just go outside kitty yeah you want to say hi to the listener

50:22.480 --> 50:32.840
Shermey no comment comment that's a resounding no nice sorry I didn't mean to

50:32.840 --> 50:36.240
let the kitty bring the show to a screeching halt but yeah this this is

50:36.240 --> 50:41.640
only slightly bothersome I would think for you know Nintendo that that somebody

50:41.640 --> 50:45.280
is actually doing HD was this a YouTube out there so YouTube they've got a whole

50:45.280 --> 50:49.520
bunch of these actually on this is a brawl that they have done on there but I

50:49.520 --> 50:54.000
mean it looks like nice it looks pretty cool yeah it does look pretty nice but

50:54.000 --> 50:58.680
yeah it's do some searches online for we emailers there's actually a guy who does

50:58.680 --> 51:02.040
our reviews of the emulators and the games and how they play in there and

51:02.040 --> 51:12.560
stuff like that I want to say let's see here I think it's um Raini Bara Hona is

51:12.560 --> 51:21.120
the user on YouTube re ne ba ra ho na and he has a bunch of different videos

51:21.120 --> 51:25.080
actually watched the Metroid Prime 3 corruption one earlier but he has

51:25.080 --> 51:28.520
reviews I think I think he's the one that's doing the reviews on him let me

51:28.520 --> 51:31.640
get some comments from chat real quick because game guru wants to clarify PCs

51:31.640 --> 51:34.920
can't read Nintendo optical discs so I was a little crazy there with that

51:34.920 --> 51:40.120
comment but also tells me that Nintendo could get 720p with a firmware update to

51:40.120 --> 51:43.920
use those four unused connections I don't know I mean keep in mind these

51:43.920 --> 51:49.160
emulators are running off computer hardware and a Wii is running off the

51:49.160 --> 51:53.320
hardware of two game cubes maybe it can't just simply run this with a

51:53.320 --> 51:56.000
firmware update or I would have hoped they would have done it a long time ago

51:56.000 --> 52:01.720
I don't know yeah I don't know either do you think Nintendo should be worried

52:01.720 --> 52:04.320
about something like this I mean the fact that their system is being

52:04.320 --> 52:09.520
emulated while it is still out there and some might say better than the actual

52:09.520 --> 52:12.880
system itself they should be worried if it's actually because there are some

52:12.880 --> 52:17.640
minor texture problems and stuff like that like there'll be some textures that

52:17.640 --> 52:21.520
are supposed to be more transparent that aren't appearing transparent or like a

52:21.520 --> 52:25.720
few little issues but they're definitely playable so they should be worried if

52:25.720 --> 52:30.040
it's able to you know do that stuff and you don't necessarily need a you know we

52:30.040 --> 52:32.880
remote and nunchuck to play this you can actually lose with keyboard and mouse

52:32.880 --> 52:36.720
you know using the mouse as the Wii pointer or whatever and you know the

52:36.720 --> 52:43.360
keyboard as your joysticks or whatever so yeah I guess you know I would

52:43.360 --> 52:46.160
actually like to play a lot more of these things on here and you check them

52:46.160 --> 52:50.840
out see what the games look like because you know mad world look really sweet it

52:50.840 --> 52:55.280
kind of makes me wish they'd poured into the 360 or something and all they're

52:55.280 --> 52:59.160
doing is they're just smoothing the textures basically they're in the 16

52:59.160 --> 53:03.520
16 times it's not like it was going back to reprogram these things or anything or

53:03.520 --> 53:07.640
any more work went into them or anything like that no not really and because the

53:07.640 --> 53:12.200
reason this was actually I mean this is the dolphin emulator was for the Game

53:12.200 --> 53:16.280
Cube and they just modified it to work with the Wii when the Wii came out

53:16.280 --> 53:21.600
because it's basically GameCube hardware and you know almost the same type of

53:21.600 --> 53:27.000
instruction set so I don't know I mean it's just you know goes to show you that

53:27.000 --> 53:32.440
the Wii is really you know very similar to a GameCube and kind of wish that they

53:32.440 --> 53:35.680
would do like a Wii HD because at the same time here's what they could do with

53:35.680 --> 53:39.760
their games they could upscale all the games that you have come out and they

53:39.760 --> 53:43.520
could you do some new or higher def games or something like that or you can

53:43.520 --> 53:47.040
spend the money and just get a new an upscaler for your you know home

53:47.040 --> 53:53.840
entertainment system and you can just do the same thing with Wii so well

53:53.840 --> 53:57.600
apparently there is a new Final Fantasy game on the way and it looks like this

53:57.600 --> 54:01.680
game is being made for the DS it was actually teased around there on the

54:01.680 --> 54:05.880
internet and then Famitsu I don't think actually no I'm sorry it came from jump

54:05.880 --> 54:09.920
magazine I believe is the the magazine that finally spilled the details on this

54:09.920 --> 54:15.760
it's Final Fantasy Gaiden it's a new kind of Final Fantasy RPG for the DS it

54:15.760 --> 54:19.680
looks a lot like the Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4 remakes that have

54:19.680 --> 54:24.520
happened recently but it's kind of a new story apparently it's about a boy who

54:24.520 --> 54:27.960
must rescue a princess from a witch your very typical kind of Final Fantasy

54:27.960 --> 54:32.040
sounding storyline their typical fantasy story although I'm sure the end of the

54:32.040 --> 54:35.600
world will somehow be worked into it as well the battle system is of course the

54:35.600 --> 54:39.480
one you all know and love the turn-based menu system there's apparently though

54:39.480 --> 54:44.600
now action points when you see your status you also have yellow dots that go

54:44.600 --> 54:49.120
with that and the actions that you want to do also have dots next to it that

54:49.120 --> 54:52.600
indicate how much it's going to cost so think of it sounds to me like it's not

54:52.600 --> 54:57.200
magic points but like fighting points a little different they're gonna be coming

54:57.200 --> 55:03.000
out in the u.s. actually I'm sorry it's gonna come out in the fall in Japan that

55:03.000 --> 55:06.200
would mean probably next year in the u.s. once they get it all translated it

55:06.200 --> 55:11.240
sounds right yeah there you go lots of fun Final Fantasy stuff I was bringing

55:11.240 --> 55:15.600
up here real quick I want to show you mad world running on the emulator and

55:15.600 --> 55:18.960
this actually should post this link in chat a chat that I was ready to call

55:18.960 --> 55:25.320
just of how sharp the game looks I mean cuz mad world it's all black and white

55:25.320 --> 55:29.240
and the line art and stuff like that you can see how it looks a little foggy

55:29.240 --> 55:32.800
right there that's you know the one of the problems with the emulator at least

55:32.800 --> 55:37.680
in this game but I mean look at how sharp everything looks it's just awesome

55:37.680 --> 55:42.400
very that is pretty neat you should share that in chat if definitely you

55:42.400 --> 55:45.560
haven't already chat dot orange launch rated calm that does look pretty nice

55:45.560 --> 55:53.320
yeah um let's see some other stuff we can talk about here we'll probably do

55:53.320 --> 55:57.040
one more story and then we'll get into the classic game of the week and part B

55:57.040 --> 56:00.560
of our show coming up a little later as well as your phone calls one eight seven

56:00.560 --> 56:04.240
seven game olr will open up the phones a little later on in the program well

56:04.240 --> 56:08.080
Nintendo might not be too worried about some games at least you know in this

56:08.080 --> 56:13.520
emulator Wii Sports Resort in Japan just came out what last week and already

56:13.520 --> 56:21.400
they've sold over 350,000 copies I'm actually selling it's the third fastest

56:21.400 --> 56:25.920
selling we title ever and it's moved three hundred fifty three thousand eight

56:25.920 --> 56:32.440
hundred and twenty seven copies as of June 30th so by now who knows but it's

56:32.440 --> 56:36.360
gonna be selling I think pretty well and who knows when it hits the US I know

56:36.360 --> 56:40.680
this thing's been selling like hotcakes already so I actually don't think you'll

56:40.680 --> 56:44.400
see the impressive day one numbers that you're seeing over in Japan I don't

56:44.400 --> 56:48.080
think the US audience especially those that are huge in the week are that as

56:48.080 --> 56:53.280
tuned in to you know when games are coming out and you know we were much

56:53.280 --> 56:56.160
more tuned in in our culture to win movies are coming out like you probably

56:56.160 --> 56:59.720
know what movies are opening up this week and actually I don't think most

56:59.720 --> 57:04.120
casual gamers and non hardcore gamers are as tuned in with the release dates

57:04.120 --> 57:07.600
so I don't think you'll see this have the same type of day one sales here but

57:07.600 --> 57:12.120
I think you'll see it grow quickly yeah definitely and I think a lot of you know

57:12.120 --> 57:16.280
casual gamers obviously probably be picking this up for like Christmas or

57:16.280 --> 57:20.360
you know the holidays there's a long period of time you know period of time

57:20.360 --> 57:25.240
and I mean look at like Mario Kart Wii it still sells really well only you

57:25.240 --> 57:29.600
know mark no Mario Party 8 that stuff sells really well it's just a lot of

57:29.600 --> 57:35.000
these games are just evergreen will sell for the life of the system so I could

57:35.000 --> 57:39.240
definitely see this lasting a long time and it probably will end up selling

57:39.240 --> 57:43.840
quite a bit and it could also be like we play whereas people bought this you know

57:43.840 --> 57:47.400
they could be buying this for we motion plus you know save some money that way

57:47.400 --> 57:51.600
and they get a game with it so I could definitely see something like that

57:51.600 --> 57:55.480
happening yeah I just don't think you know I think when it comes out here

57:55.480 --> 57:59.080
you're gonna see I bet you that first week oh I didn't sell nearly as well in

57:59.080 --> 58:04.240
the u.s. is it in Japan oh my gosh it's it's a failure for Nintendo mmm give it

58:04.240 --> 58:09.040
a couple months give it a couple months for the hardcore gamers who still love

58:09.040 --> 58:12.760
a Nintendo to pick it up and then their friends to see it and then their friends

58:12.760 --> 58:15.960
to see it and then CNN to do a news story on it and then Oprah to have it on

58:15.960 --> 58:20.560
her show give it some time wrong wrong it will not be Oprah having in our show

58:20.560 --> 58:24.800
it'll be Ellen DeGeneres because she likes hey Ellen Ellen has a very high

58:24.800 --> 58:29.920
rated show don't don't hate don't hate on Ellen I'm just saying Oprah's not

58:29.920 --> 58:36.000
she's more tech retarded as I'd like to put I don't know if I should admit that

58:36.000 --> 58:39.480
I was watching Oprah but I was I was changing the channels and landed on

58:39.480 --> 58:44.040
Oprah one day this is a couple months ago she had Facebook on her show they

58:44.040 --> 58:46.880
were talking they were doing I know Oprah I guess has this thing where she

58:46.880 --> 58:50.600
rips off the view now where she actually has a panelist of people on some some

58:50.600 --> 58:53.920
days of the week I don't know but she had the dude from Facebook they're

58:53.920 --> 58:57.640
talking about the business and I guess that was the same day that Oprah was

58:57.640 --> 59:01.640
launching her own Facebook account or official Facebook or something it was

59:01.640 --> 59:05.240
just like Twitter when she had Twitter on her show that site blew up remember

59:05.240 --> 59:09.520
that yeah when they announced the official Oprah Twitter don't

59:09.520 --> 59:15.000
underestimate the power of Oprah some might say that was the day the Twitter

59:15.000 --> 59:21.880
jumped the shark to j-rod says people scream failure if it doesn't sell a

59:21.880 --> 59:25.320
million in its first week remember how little big planet was a failure yeah I

59:25.320 --> 59:29.120
mean I would actually agree with you the little big planet not only is it one of

59:29.120 --> 59:33.800
the best games on PlayStation 3 right now period if not the best in some

59:33.800 --> 59:38.560
circles but I think that's still a game that sells fairly well I don't know

59:38.560 --> 59:42.840
PlayStation 3 figures that well but I have to be a consistent seller too I

59:42.840 --> 59:47.400
don't think it's really like tapered off horrifically or anything I think you

59:47.400 --> 59:50.440
know I don't think you can really compare Sony sales figures to Nintendo

59:50.440 --> 59:53.800
sales figures I think horribly underrated underappreciated and it's

59:53.800 --> 59:57.440
gonna be one of those games like katamari was where is horribly

59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.720
underrated underappreciated and you know granted we all as game fans might

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.640
appreciate it and understand how awesome it is but the casual gamer they don't

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:10.080
understand it and you know it's sad because I think if you put it in the

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.320
hands of like someone that is more of a casual gamer and they actually played it

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.640
they would probably think it's really cool but then again there's some people

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.400
there's like oh my god controllers oh I can't I can't I can't do that although

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.400
really the only you know stuff in little big planet is run jump and occasionally

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.680
grab yeah but you have to understand these are the same people that can't

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.120
hook up their damn game systems it's all color-coded true true yellow the yellow

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:40.760
I mean it's matching matching colors can you not understand that I guess not some

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.280
people can't some people can't all right should we get into the classic game of

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.120
the week I think we shall did you want to say one more one more thing real

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.400
quick is really quick go electroplankton is coming to DSI where in Japan only and

01:00:53.400 --> 01:01:00.440
of course it will be sold for oh that's a ripoff anyways it's picking their

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.240
their breaking up electroplankton because it was 10 different little

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.720
programs that you can make music with they're breaking them all up individually

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:15.680
the 200 Nintendo points each so $20 total seemed kind of a ripoff if you

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.180
ask me but I think that's what the game originally sold for I was to say you had

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.740
to originally buy like it was weird they didn't even market this game big time

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:26.040
you had to buy it through Nintendo site you can even get in stores remember yeah

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.980
and having played electroplankton I don't get what the point is I mean it

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:37.120
was it was neat for a second and then I put it down and never touches again so I

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.180
can't recommend buying this but hey if you're in Japan and you want to waste

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:47.640
you know some points there you go all right we are gonna get into the classic

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.760
game of the week we like to take a few moments here at the end of part a every

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.680
week to reflect on gaming's history and some of the games that helped bring the

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.640
games we have today out there usually dark Sakura goes through her archives

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.100
and picks a classic game of the week but since she's not here tonight the one and

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:06.800
only Loki it's his turn to replace her with his entry into the classic game of

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:12.480
the week and I believe he has picked a doozy this week so Loki what is the

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.160
classic game of the week this week classic game of the week has been a

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:20.100
game that I've wasted countless hours on one of my favorite games has been on

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:26.040
every Nintendo system it would be Mario Kart not a Super Mario Kart Super Mario

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:32.040
Kart yes careful well I like Mario Kart in general but Mario Kart one started

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:39.720
all on the Super Nintendo came out in 1992 wow that was a long time ago and

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:50.040
did quite well sold you know I think eight million copies worldwide and was

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:56.840
the I think number two title for the super NES really yeah wow that must be

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:03.720
only behind what Mario World even though that was the pack-in game I think so Wow

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.920
Mario World actually was it I take it back it was not number two is number

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:18.320
three but hey it's close enough I mean don't keep on country also I want to

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.320
point out Game Guru and chat says Mario Kart wasn't on the NES or Game Boy true

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.360
but they still called it Super Mario Kart the name of this game is Super Mario

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:32.200
Mario Kart yes Super Mario Kart was one of those mode seven games you race

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.840
around on kind of a flat track but of course you have little blocks and stuff

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.240
that made the course and everything they had a bunch of different theme levels

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:46.760
including you know the booze mansion and well they weren't really a mansion it

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.560
was kind of like Doc's almost like dark place but a Bowser's castle of course

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.720
they had the mushroom cup shell cup flower cup banana cup and you had

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:01.840
unlocked you know each of the I think it'd be golden those in order to unlock

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.080
the rest of the cup and of course who would forget you know who could forget

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:10.680
the special cup that they had there with Rainbow Road which is awesome Rainbow

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:19.200
Road was sweet and but the thing that I spent the most time on and oh so many

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:25.520
hours lost to this versus mode versus in battle mode you know we played battle

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.320
mode forever and battle mode of course you the object of the game was to pop

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:36.000
the other carts three balloons and you know we've wasted so much time doing

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.920
that but you'd have different shells of course the green shell was kind of

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.120
dumbfire shell that you'd shoot straight ahead you've got red shell which you

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:49.200
know is kind of a homing missile almost your bananas they drop behind you to you

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:55.520
know get out the other player also you know your mushrooms for boosts and in

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:59.200
the original game actually they had the feather that you get they could jump and

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.840
that was handy for jumping walls or jumping the shortcuts and stuff like

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:08.920
that of course later on they had more sequels for the game on practically

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:14.600
every Nintendo system is actually on every Nintendo system and they even made

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:21.640
its debut in the arcade with two arcade games Mario Kart arcade GP and GP to

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:26.600
the first one of course I am famous for playing drunk during my bachelor party

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:31.200
and which by far orange launch radios most viewed YouTube clip and I don't

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:36.360
remember much of it but I'm actually did play it later on it was all right and

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:42.160
it's not the same it doesn't have the same charm no it doesn't but uh you know

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.880
of course the original Super Mario Kart game had quite a few characters in there

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:50.480
you know they had some unlockable characters as well but the starting

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:57.680
lineup of course yet Bowser Luigi Mario peach Toad and Yoshi and you can also

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:05.400
unlock don't come junior and Koopa Koopa and of course the little trick is you

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:19.200
can shrink those down as well and yeah pretty much it and it also actually made

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:23.520
its way to the Guinness Book World Records gamers edition 2008 which goes

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.900
to show you that they will put pretty much anything in this book but it was

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:32.960
awarded the first console kart racing game and best-selling a handheld racing

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.920
game course cuz you know was it really that yes it was really the first kart

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.960
racing game interesting I wonder what they got the idea for this

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:47.320
they actually fact-checked that stuff that seems awfully weird I don't doubt

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:51.080
that it's true I mean I can't think of another one that there was but it's just

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.280
kind of interesting

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.280
yeah

01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:01.920
but uh yeah I mean lots of fun and you know of course my car we came out last

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:07.400
year still pretty fun but you know it just doesn't have a charm I think of an

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.840
original Mario Kart game which is available for virtual console download I

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:17.600
believe remember correctly is this a good one it is I know Mario Kart 64 is I

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.720
don't know about the classic though really I don't think the classic one is

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.840
still up surprise surprise to it maybe it is and I just missed it amongst all

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.440
the other crap that they put out honestly I haven't downloaded anything

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:34.240
in person for a long time so it's been mainly we were this was my college dorm

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.320
years by the way do you know what the epic battles we had on this game in my

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.440
college dorm and this is probably about 96 or 97 or so I remember when the

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.320
people upstairs got a Nintendo 64 and got Mario Kart 64 oh my god that was

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:55.800
before I was not as big of a fan of 64 as I was this one but it was you know

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:59.160
still really fun to play and I think I just this one is kind of one of those

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.600
like you know sentimental type games for the love of God Nintendo when you put

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.680
out a new Mario Kart game and I know how you like doing classic tracks and stuff

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:13.320
is it gonna really kill you to not you know include all of the old battle

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.320
courses or something like that they always seem to find the ones that like

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:20.800
nobody played and let's just like bring that one back it's it's like come on

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.840
well dude in that new one they had battle course 4 and that was the one we

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.600
always played on the old school one was the you know with the squares square

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.160
square kind of looking thing yeah we used to play that one all the time so

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.040
it just wasn't the same though no I wasn't without the feather because you

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.000
get the feather you can jump or the wall oh that's true I didn't think about the

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.400
feather huh interesting all right well that's gonna do it for your classic game

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.320
of the week Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo good pick yeah apparently

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:51.040

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.920

anyway part B here we go we're gonna get to your mailbag and the FUs of the week

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.880
and the release dates we got all sorts of stuff we should go still get a cover

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.240
I'm sure though Loki has a little few more news stories for us I have tons of

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:21.160
news stories and let's talk about a music game because that's what's awesome

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:26.240
DJ Hero announced of course that they're gonna be I should say Activision

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:31.600
announced the DJ Hero would contain Grandmaster Flash and not only will he

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.200
be appearing in the game as himself and you know among the cast of other DJs

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:41.720
that are in the game but he'll also be contributing to songs including one

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:48.920
remix as Herbie Hancock rocket versus nerds lap dance and then also Grand

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:55.840
Master Flash here comes my DJ and versus Gary Newman cars I'm all about DJ Hero I

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:01.080
think this game looks awesome yes yes it looks really sweet I'm not surprised

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:04.840
though that they're including the old you know some of the old the some of the

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.960
deep famous DJ is kind of like they do in guitar here all right you have like

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.480
slash shows up and you know buckethead and some of these people so it's pretty

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:17.720
cool yeah so I'm very cool and you know just excited that we're gonna we're

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:23.480
hearing more songs coming out of it um what else was I wanted to say about DJ

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.960
Hero it's still gonna be extensive though of course is the only kind of

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.680
outside but what do you do but the thing is though is it's the only game I'm

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.360
buying this fall really out of all the stuff coming out this fall silly game

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.720
I'm buying this fall because you can't pirate the the turntable I see how you

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:46.200
know it really deserves my money but um yeah it's just you know with kids coming

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:51.320
you know really honestly I mean piracy aside you know I'm probably not gonna

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.160
be playing a lot of games in the fall we'll be playing the grant of thought oh

01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:00.320
expansion a new one but that's for sure but really with kids coming is just like

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:06.360
I'll be lucky to play DJ Hero I hope we get DJ Samantha Ronson in the game though

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.480
so we can have her girlfriend Lindsay Lohan or on again off again girlfriend

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:16.920
make a cameo pretty awesome I think so yeah but is she any good has she

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:21.640
actually made music I think she's a somewhat respected DJ I think it's more

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.120
than just who her girlfriend is Sacramento not that long ago they were

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:31.240
promoting it on the radio I don't know I had there's a lot joking I don't think

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.520
she's a long list of other DJs I'd rather see in the game than her fine fine

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:40.360
I try to make a silly little joke I know that's what I do like have we heard a

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.640
lot about download content with DJ hero there will be some that's about all we

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:49.080
know because I know someone actually I for whatever reason they have visited

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.200
their website and actually looked at their Twitter and there was someone

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.920
asking hey is there gonna be download content and they're like of course

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.400
there's gonna be download content but not necessarily regularly like you see

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.200
in rock band because guitar heroes download content seems to be a bit more

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:08.800
sporadic yeah I'd be guessing that's gonna be a bit more sporadic Marissa

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.400
congusto in our chat room chat that orange laundry calm says it could be a

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.440
pixelated low hand tweeting naked pics that would be a true to life wouldn't it

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:23.400
a little to do life all right what else you have for us lovey also of course not

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.200
really something I would utilize and not really something you'd utilize anymore

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:35.680
but Twitter has come to Warcraft thanks to tweet craft a in-game client that you

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:44.480
can get you can now Twitter inside the confines of Warcraft this would actually

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:49.600
be cool believe it or not if I was like a role player I think it would be kind

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.280
of neat to have a character using a Twitter like create a character and have

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:58.000
them tweet about the things they're doing in World of Warcraft and I think

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.400
that's probably what most people use it for but I just hope it doesn't turn into

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:06.880
this whole like oh I just turned in this quest oh I just dinged to level 77 oh

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.200
we're running this instance anyone want to join because we don't really need to

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.300
fill Twitter up with that garbage I hope none of my personal friends are you

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:17.600
gonna use this for that but if they're using it to keep all the crack in their

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.800
vein like they play World of War crack and have Twitter at the same time like

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.480
I can also understand the need to have that crack all at once all they need now

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.880
is Facebook as well in World of Warcraft if they don't already have it and then

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.560
everybody's crack should be set I know according to the screen shot here it

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.880
doesn't look like they're using it for roleplay in fact one of the people says

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.920
thank God CNN's finally segueing from reporting on Michael Jackson's still

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:47.820
being dead to reporting on what happened to bubbles the chimp nice formation we

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:51.440
need to know right away I'm reading this stuff in chat which is great

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.760
tiger class says great now you can tweet when you're in a wow raid SSJ 100 Matt

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.840
says at Rob I just got a four strength force damn leather belt that's a all

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:10.400
games inside joke I'll have you know frisbee says mom bathroom nice let's

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.880
just encourage people to not have any human interaction whatsoever by putting

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.760
Twitter in World of Warcraft exactly I'm not gonna say I'm glad I left because

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:24.280
I'm not vindictive about the reasons I left but I am I'm I'm comfortable with

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.000
my decision and you know that there's many other games to be playing right now

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.840
and something although sorry I will say this I am kind of sad that I feel like

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.920
some people I don't talk to anymore because I don't play World of Warcraft

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:41.160
which is kind of sad I'm like just call me dude let's hang out let's do some

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.560
besides rating hang out in World of Warcraft

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.760
I know no it's something you may need if you really you're you know living the

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.920
sedentary lifestyle hopefully I will never need this but there is a new DS

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.680
plug-in that you can use with your DS and DS I because it actually plugs into

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:06.960
the DS slot and not the you know the gameboy advanced lot but it is a a

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:13.800
device called digit and it's for helping diabetic kids record their sugar levels

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:20.160
so that they can see if they're okay you know it helps them test their sugar and

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:26.200
I don't know so really you can turn your DS into a diabetic monitor now yeah it's

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:32.480
a you know sugar glucose reader and it's I'm not sure if you can use this like

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:36.040
well I'll tell you right now your insurance ain't gonna cover it so what

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:40.640
you're gonna be paying for that out-of-pocket but I guess what it is

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.640
probably it's like a diabetic monitor you know when you're diabetic you have

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:47.440
to track you know this I'm you have to track your glucose several times a day

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.800
it depends on how you know there's different stages of diabetes is a very

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.200
common disease like Halle Berry has diabetes a lot of very famous people

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.800
have diabetes you have to track your your sugar levels several points

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.640
throughout the day and then it's you might be what they call insulin

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:05.000
dependent or if your levels are really out of whack you have to inject yourself

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.280
with insulin this monitor if they're encouraging kids to use this monitor

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:11.720
there with their DS is probably a way to kind of track those levels but more so

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.120
for their parents to look at it I bet is it's actually kind of a neat use of

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.160
technology I actually think it's kind of a neat use of the DS this is this is a

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:26.680
feel-good CNN good news story of the week type thing and intended in think of

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:32.160
it first screw you vitality monitor alpha

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.680
kenanagram in chat says Loki yeah this looks like bears ray rebranding of the

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.320
glucose boy independent they look the same so I'm guessing bear about the tech

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:43.700
from the guy that made glucose boy probably possibly who knows frisbee

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:51.640
Aston chat where can I when can I have the Wii Fit glaucoma meter so I do think

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:55.400
it's a pretty pretty neat idea hey look you brought up World of Warcraft earlier

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:58.200
and I want to talk about this a little bit because I thought this story was

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.720
very interesting having been in a game that was ruined by gold farming or in

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.880
that particular game Gill farming the game was completely ruined by that

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.080
although they have made a motion to fix it I'll give credit where credit is due

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:16.520
but it came way too late anyhow there was just stories going crazy around the

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.880
net this week that China had actually banned gold farming which is a huge

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.240
industry in China it's what like 500 million dollar industry in China that it

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:30.920
was banned this week which is huge news well I don't know if you're aware but

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:36.000
not really that's not really what happened here's what China really banned

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.440
was using virtual money for gambling and will be you know punished by you know

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.440
public security authorities and miners cannot use cannot buy virtual money

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.760
here's what it really comes down to is I think it's well a it's miners too it's

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:54.120
not you know adults but also the fact that the real problem and and Richard

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.280
Heeks who is a professor at the University of Manchester kind of breaks

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.920
it down it's what it really is is using these fake currencies one of the big

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.880
ones is called QQ coins used to buy real I know it's funny huh used to of QQ I

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:14.160
don't have any real money using these QQ coins to pay for virtual game stuff

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:18.960
apparently some folks were using them to pay for real things and that's what the

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:23.760
law is to prevent using virtual currency to buy real products that's what it

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.400
comes down to and most people are when you do gold farming that's the other way

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:32.840
around you're paying real money for virtual items that's still okay it's the

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.440
other way around that is now illegal which isn't going to impact any of the

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.400
gold farming industry I'm sorry to say and that makes everyone go QQ exactly

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:47.680
because the QQ dollars are still out there that's all I got that's funny do

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:54.600
you think they should ban the real thing I don't know if they can that's where I'm

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:59.200
at I'm like you know what why bother at this point it's out there it's up to the

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.920
game makers I think to some extent to stop this shit if they want to really they

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:09.280
if they really wanted to stop this crap they could but most don't and really you

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:14.800
know as much as I see you know you know it it's not a good thing to buy money

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.400
they're kind of doing the work and earning the money they're not really

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.380
exploiting unless they're exploiting the game is cheap and get the money you know

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:25.440
if they're earning the money in the game and there's someone out there it's

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.900
desperate enough to pay for that money. I don't see the problem in that. I see the

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:32.760
problem in if they're cheating to get the money and then it screws up the whole

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:37.500
economy. Plus, it also depends on the game's design. Like, I don't think gold

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.320
farming is that big of an epidemic in World of Warcraft. I know it's out there,

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:44.120
I know it's being done, but in World of Warcraft it's not that hard to make

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:48.080
money. They have dailies, they have ways to make money. Gold farming is for lazy

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.360
people. If people are too lazy to make gold the hard way. Now here's the thing,

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.280
in Final Fantasy XI, you couldn't make gil that easily. You could not make gil

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.960
as easily as you can make money. And some would argue with me, you know, and

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.980
that's just ridiculous. And again, I realize the game has changed an

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:07.400
awful lot since I left. You know, now they have more things that are solo. I'm

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.400
talking about the old Final Fantasy XI. Things that I hope Square has learned

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:16.480
before Final Fantasy XIV, in other words, is that, you know, gil farming was an

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.280
epidemic and it was killing the game. Because what would happen is, yeah, what

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.040
was the only way to make gil? You camp these notorious monsters that would drop

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.240
items that would be worth millions of gil. Well guess what? All the gold farmers

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.440
are out there camping with you and they got good at it. But WoW doesn't have

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:34.240
that as an epidemic. So, you know, finally, years later, they changed it in Final

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.160
Fantasy where the items would bind a certain way. You know, it just took them

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.560
too damn long to do it. Lessons, again, I hope they have learned moving into Final

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:44.760
Fantasy XIV. Because Final Fantasy XIV has the potential to be amazing.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:48.720
Rama asked in our chat room, chat.orangemanstrategy.com, now with Final

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.880
Fantasy XIV will they shut down Final Fantasy XI? Hardly. No. Will they have

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:57.120
to do server consolidations and things of this sort? Probably. Will they lose

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:01.520
players? Probably. But they'll probably charge more for Final Fantasy XIV. Not a

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.920
lot more, but they'll probably charge like 1495 or 1595 a month. Because they

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:09.400
could probably get away with it. So they won't care if people jump ship because

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.840
they'll end up making more money off of them. I guess XI. It's actually... I had a lot of fun with it.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.320
I did too, you know, but I'll tell you what, Loki, I went back, tried to play

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.840
again. It's just, you know, maybe if all the people were still there, which I don't

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:24.440
think is gonna happen, it would be kind of cooler. But the way it is right now,

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:29.720
I just... I don't have the time for an MMO anyway, so... But I'm looking forward to

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:33.480
Final Fantasy XIV. I am definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV. I'm all

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.560
over that shit. I'm not looking forward to it because I won't be able to play it,

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:40.600
probably. Poor thing. What you can do, come over to my house. You can play.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.880
Just, you know, tell the wife you're coming over to hang out with Rob. We're gonna

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:55.240
watch movies. Bring the kids! Get them into it. No, no, no, that, you know, I... Nellie

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:59.840
doesn't want the kids playing video games. I mean, basically she doesn't want them

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:03.400
ignoring homework to play the video games. Just fine. I understand that,

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.320
because, you know what, I never did that. I always did my homework, and then, well, I

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.000
most of the time did my homework, and I didn't really, you know, play video games.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.480
It wasn't an issue like that, but they're gonna play video games. They're, yeah,

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.000
they're gonna play video games more than the other. I think what your wife

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.280
hopefully already knows is that if you try to stop them from doing it, they're

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.040
just going to want to do it more. So you just have to find a balance, is that you

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:31.760
can play one out. You can use the TV for two hours. You want to watch cartoons. You

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:35.300
want to play video games. Whatever the F you want to do on the TV. I wouldn't say

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:38.640
that, obviously, but whatever the F, and me explaining it to you, whatever the F

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.960
you want to do for the TV with two hours, that's yours. But either A, once your

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:46.280
homework gets done first, or B, once your two hours is up, you better be doing your

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:50.120
homework, or you're gonna lose your TV time, you know, something like that.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.120
That's the kind of system I think you have to do. Always homework first.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:24:01.560
Yes. Okay, let's talk a little bit about, wait, can I say, can I say, because this is

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.600
obviously a sparked discussion in our chat room. I have to read this at

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:08.800
chat.orangelandtrader.com. First off, about Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV,

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:13.440
SGA 100 Matt says they said they will continue to release expansion for Final Fantasy XI,

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.480
and especially now that they're doing the download expansions now, like there's

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.360
the MOG, the coup d'etat, or whatever they call it. What the hell is it called,

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.280
the new Mughal one? The coup d'etat is coming out today, I think, is

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.960
when it came out. They're doing the download ones now. They'll continue to do

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.120
that. Just like EverQuest and EverQuest 2 is that I think, unlike EverQuest and EverQuest 2,

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:37.120
I think you will see a lot more players on Final Fantasy XIV than XI. I think a lot of

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:40.680
people who left XI are gonna come back for XIV. I think that will happen.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:47.760
Also, some comments on the babies. Tigerclaw says they're gonna play video games while

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.000
parents are asleep. That's true. If the TV is in the kids room with the console,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.440
they're gonna play the video games while you sleep. TV is not gonna be in the kids room.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:58.640
GS68 says, from kindergarten through third grade, my parents would only let me play video games on

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:04.760
weekends. And I'm thinking, you know, the kids can play not the new console games.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:09.040
They gotta play the old stuff, because it also is more family-friendly, you know, whereas the new stuff,

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:14.240
you know, no playing Grand Theft Auto. Although, although with Grand Theft Auto, you know, I know

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:17.960
enough about hacking that I could probably take out the blood and stuff.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.440
Marisa Congusto in chat says, my dad had a really good parenting strategy so I

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.560
couldn't play too many video games. He played them so I couldn't. That's more

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.600
like it. You should suggest that to the wife. I'm only playing video games

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:41.600
so the kids can do their homework. I'm doing you a favor. Now cook dinner.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.040
Then she needs to learn how to play video games, I don't know. Alright. Yeah, you're gonna learn how to play video games or cook dinner.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:52.440
You need to play one or the other. She's gonna cook dinner because she hates video games.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:56.360
Or she'll play Animal Crossing for the rest of her life. To talk a little bit more about Sony

01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:00.600
PlayStation. You may remember, of course, they have their PlayStation Eye-based

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:05.120
motion capture system that they're planning on using for some really

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:11.880
retarded looking ice cream cone things. But there's apparently another tech thing

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:17.200
that they, I guess, registered a patent for that's gonna utilize what looks like

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:24.280
a giant square-shaped U-thing. Almost like the U-Force. You know, kind of scary

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:29.720
enough, but apparently you would use this device in your hands, I guess, in

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:36.280
replace, you know, to replace the cosmic ice cream cone thing. But you would use it,

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:42.240
I guess, like a, you know, baseball bat or golf club or, you know, sword, whatever.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:47.840
That thing's gonna get broken. That thing looks retarded, if you ask me. Well, maybe

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.320
it was just patented. That doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna use it. I

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:56.560
don't know. Just a giant U of death. applicant anagram is saying that's just

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.880
a random object, not a controller. That the U is supposed to represent some type

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.040
of object the person has in their home. And that's what I had thought I'd read

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.760
is something about that you can use this thing is supposed to be, like, so any

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.800
object can be used in the game. Which is kind of similar. Isn't that similar to what

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.080
Natal was saying, too? Yeah. It's gonna be able to scan, like, the kid's skateboard

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.800
in a little preview. Okay, well that, yeah. So something similar here, right? That'll work as

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:23.680
well as they show, but yeah. That's neat. I don't like the idea of those swinging

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:28.120
around something that even resembles a baseball bat in my house, so. Unless it's

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:32.240
a Nerf bat. Even then. Couldn't you just roll up a piece of paper and tell the

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.920
game it's a bat? It would work, right? Roll up the newspaper, thunk. Couldn't I

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.880
hold up the cat and say it's a baseball bat? How long is it gonna take before

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.560
someone tries to use their penis on this? It's gonna happen. That's the age-old

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:53.000
question about new peripherals. How long before a penis is used with it? How long?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.920
Try 30 seconds. That's the length of time to unzip and unzip the pants and undo the

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:07.460
bell buckle. Scan this! Oh my god. Alright. Hey, look. We got some emails we got to

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:10.840
read, so let's get to the mailbag. How's that sound? Mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.800
That's where you send your emails every week and we read some of our favorites

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.840
here on the show. That's exactly what I'm gonna do right now. If the Star Stalker's not here

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:23.540
tonight, I will read them. If you can scan its objects to be used as guns, you can

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:28.600
have your own laser tag. Yes, whatever happened to laser cat the video game? You

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.400
think with community games we would have this now? I'm surprised we don't.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:36.400
Somebody needs to get on that. Sorry, I had the music blaring that whole time.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.200
Mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com if you want to send us an email. Email. First email

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:45.680
to us tonight comes from Rick and Rick sent us an email and the subject is

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.920
Nintendo divorce notice. I would like to hereby make public my intention to

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:53.760
divorce Nintendo after many faithful years of devotion to each and every

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:57.680
Nintendo console that has been released. After investing many years of my life

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.400
playing the great library of classic games including a substantial financial

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:05.560
investment, I feel my relationship with the Wii is drawing to a close. We made it

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.640
past the rough patch a few years ago with the GameCube and yes I admit I did

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.640
cheat on Nintendo with Microsoft and bought an Xbox. I've already apologized

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:16.760
for this affair. It's in the past we moved on. And then the Wii came along and

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:20.800
life was good again. We had such good times together with Zelda, Metroid and

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.960
Mario but there was something wrong, something nagging in the back of my mind.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:27.560
Could it be all the shovelware that was becoming more and more common? Could it

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.200
be all the ported games with waggle attached for no fucking reason? Could it

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.880
be last year's E3? Could it be all the party games? What's next? Motion control?

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.800
Yaris? The answer to all these questions is yes. You just don't seem to be trying

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.040
anymore Nintendo. Do you care? I waited and waited watching this year's E3 for a

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:50.680
sign that you still cared but no you let me down yet again. Why should I stay? What

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:54.240
can you offer me as a reason to hang around? Why shouldn't I just go and sell

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:58.160
my Wii and put the money towards a PlayStation 3? More Mario Galaxy you

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:02.560
lazy bastards that's just fat you trimmed from Galaxy One. Mario multiplayer

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:07.600
ported from the DS. Zelda? A painting? A frickin poster? And they said the Zelda

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.080
game actually is not gonna be very different than the first one which means

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:13.400
it's gonna be raining on the same engine. I'm reading this poor man's please

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:19.360
to the divorce court. A statement about no sword? That's it? Get fucked! Kid IKEA

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:25.320
RS? Oh there oh it's there it's coming news flash we don't care anymore. At the

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.920
end of the day I'm going to be a dad soon and my time will be a precious

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:31.320
commodity. I need to know that you are taking things seriously if not I'm

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:36.160
walking to the nearest Sony store. It's so sad. You used to try so hard and

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.280
produce such wonderful gaming experiences. You were top of the pile now

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:43.880
you're more bothered about coming on to my grandmother and small children. You

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:51.640
disgust me Nintendo. Regards Rick. P.S. I get custody of the Nintendog. Well we will

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:55.400
see how that holds up in divorce court with judge who is it in divorce court

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:59.400
Judge Mabel? He's Judge Mabel. Of course if he's in the UK he's not even gonna

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:04.160
get that joke so forget it. All right that was a well-written divorce letter

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:09.240
and I can't say I it's tough it's tough being a hardcore gaming fan and watching

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.200
what's going on with the Wii but at the same time I think he summed it up right

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.480
at the end they're more interested in hitting on your grandmother and little

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:21.240
children and they're doing a good job of it you can't deny that but you know

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.880
we're just not the bread and butter for Nintendo anymore maybe Nintendo felt

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.360
they already lost us between the 64 and the GameCube. I don't know. Well wait not

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:33.400
to try. But my thought is a lot of us were children or at least younger when

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:37.480
those systems were out I mean wouldn't you I don't know. The problem is they're

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:45.440
kind of catering to stupid people but they think that people like they're oh

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:49.200
my god you know games are so hard I can't play them well you give it to a

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:55.080
kid you know he's gonna figure it out I mean I was a kid I figured out how

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:58.600
to play video games you know it may not have been I may not have been good at it

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:03.040
at first but it took time I had to practice get better and you know

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.360
nowadays I think kids should do the same thing because if they're just

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:10.360
immediately great at it then good that gives them a self-esteem boost but they

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:16.280
still suck it's just the game is really easy. Now I'm looking in chat and some

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:21.040
folks want the emailer to understand about Metroid Other M they neglected in

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:25.480
their whole little statement there but J-Rod offered up this interesting

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.040
retort I can think of at least three games from both Sony and Microsoft for me

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:32.520
three that I want on day one Nintendo had one game during a two-hour

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:38.720
conference. Yeah that is true so but I mean does look cool. Metroid M does look

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.960
sweet. They just need like ten more of those. And here's the thing though

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:47.640
okay is it looks cool but is it actually gonna be cool? We'll see we'll give them

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:52.760
the benefit of the doubt we'll see but again they need ten of those. Yeah they

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:56.960
really do need more hits throughout the year I mean because I'm sorry but you

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:01.080
know people will probably be dumb enough to buy New Super Mario Brothers Wii

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:05.640
because it's got Mario in the name and because some parents are like oh my god

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.600
Mario I gotta buy it you know and they don't know anything about it could be

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:14.400
Mario teaches Sudoku and they would probably buy that crap but I don't know.

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.240
Email number two tonight of five emails we got a few to burn through tonight

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:22.160
email number two comes to us from serious turtle this is a very serious

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:25.560
turtle we need to take this very seriously guys a couple months ago I

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.280
discovered podcast alley and thus your show I forgot we were listed on podcast

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:36.920
alley that's an old-school podcast podcast exactly oh my lucky stars I've

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:41.200
been needing a show like this my whole life I don't have any friends who are

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.440
hardcore gamers like me so when I heard your show it was fantastic to hear

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.520
people like me who talked about the things I care about thanks for all the

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.600
time you invest in the show and tell Loki to stop yelling the turtle sorry I

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:58.200
have a problem look this this serious turtle has it has a serious issue with

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.280
you Loki and that is that you yell too damn much I got to talk to you that's

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:05.440
something this is great oh no totally go on a tangent but oh alright funny fine

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:11.480
so apparently earlier this week Nellie was convinced that I had Asperger's

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:17.560
syndrome isn't that kind of like it's like autism okay so she so your wife

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:22.960
thinks you're autistic yes yes because apparently people stricken with Asperger's

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:28.120
they have the tendency to be very focused on certain things or whatever

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:33.400
basically you know I piss her off a lot by like going on my computer and working

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.520
on something for a while and not realizing what I'm doing not realizing

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.680
it's making her angry and some of that and there is a lot of times that I do

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.440
that and I don't realize it's making her angry I don't really cuz in my mind it

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:47.260
justify like oh okay well I hung out with her quite a bit in stuff but you

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:51.640
know I guess it's not the right time to be doing that or something like that or

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:56.160
like all randomly blurred out stuff like like at your party or something there's

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.560
people talking about something and somehow I found a way to work in games

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:04.080
in there and I blurted out something completely random about like you know

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.480
like they're talking about like some song may hear something, hey that song is in

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.080
rock band you know it's supposed to be coming out in a few weeks on you know

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:14.880
download content or something it's like no one cares but you know for whatever

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.760
reason I feel compelled to do that all the time and I can't stop myself you

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:25.320
just this show just isn't enough Loki you've spent seven years okay you've

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.960
spent at least seven years of your life getting the gaming knowledge out there

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.000
in a way this radio station is perfect for you I don't think it's as per I

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.000
don't know go to a doctor and no no there's no it there's nothing that has

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.320
to do that because it's actually you're very socially you know unable to cope

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.040
with everything basically you can't well I think there's a function in society

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:49.640
we're not medical professionals not even gonna try and get into it but it's you

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.280
know it was funny because there's a lot of symptoms on there and they're like

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.940
they're different work fields that would be perfect okay but look you go into web

01:35:55.940 --> 01:36:00.480
MD like yeah and you tell web MD you have certain symptoms I've got this and

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.580
this and this this every time it tells you cancer every time you go in there

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:08.300
and you're like oh I've got cancer I've got a rash on my ass and it kind of you

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:15.960
know it flames love oh you have ass cancer you know like or like or yeah

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:22.080
you're all yes or no it's not the Tuma anyway sorry to get off on tangent there

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:29.680
I just thought it was funny all right next email yes please next email stop

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.000
trying to talk about things you know nothing about all right this comes to us

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.240
from death wishing I feel like I have not been involved in your shows for a

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:42.320
long time have I missed a lot yes anyways now to get on with some email

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:46.080
material have you guys ever heard of a game called urban terror well if you

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.760
have not then there is no reason to not try the game because because well it's

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:54.080
absolutely free it was originally a quake 3 mod and then went into its own

01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:00.080
standalone game I cannot describe how it plays but I guess it's a miss a miss I

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:03.640
think a combination of counter-strike and quake hence it being a quake 3 mod

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:09.240
well let's hope I don't miss the cast again I've never heard of this any urban

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:15.360
terror so the only thing I've heard of there was a urban chaos or something

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.040
like that game that was from idos or something that really sucked but that

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:27.120
sounds kind of neat email number four from shook hi everyone I've been

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.120
following this show for about three months and I can honestly say that this

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:32.960
is the best video game related show I've ever listened to why thank you I

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.960
encourage you guys to keep doing this show and if you're reading this on the

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:39.120
seventh anniversary I wish to congratulate you on the feet well you're

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.440
a week late but that's probably my fault because the seventh anniversary show

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:45.280
still hasn't hit the feed but thank you nonetheless seventh anniversary or not

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.240
we'll just say we'll say that's a pre grats for our eighth anniversary yeah

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:54.280
there you go last email tonight from the one and only spazzinator hi everyone I

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:58.240
thought I'd write this email for tonight show mainly to share a tidbit of info by

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.280
the looks of things Sony will be doing three things more or less in tandem this

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:06.080
summer rolling out the long rumor ps3 slim drop the price of the ps3 by an

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:10.040
unknown amount and release firmware 3.0 which by most accounts will be a fairly

01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.800
big overhaul so I'm reading this email because we've addressed some of this but

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.040
we didn't really talk about new firmware most sources agree that firmware 3.0 has

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.480
certain features on it similar to what Xbox Live has reputation and griefing

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.640
procedures as well as finally being able to download game updates in the

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:27.280
background where there is still some debate as to whether or not firmware 3.0

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.080
will also incorporate the recently uncovered patented ps2 emulator that

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.640
will supposedly work on all ps3s my suspicions are that the emulator will

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:39.000
indeed be coming most likely in firmware 3.0 or at least in the next major from

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.840
where to firmware update after that my reasoning is this there's no reason for

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.240
any company Sony or any other one to patent anything unless they see a way to

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:49.720
make money off of it directly or indirectly seeing as the PlayStation 3

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:54.080
sales have been lagging behind the Wii's in the 360s hell even the ps2s these

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.320
moves that I've mentioned should in theory bolster sales which is

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:00.680
ultimately what Sony and some third-party developers want ultimately

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.400
this is all just hearsay educated guessing on my part until we see here

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.320
something official however given my tracker record in as far as far as relaying

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:13.280
info it's subsequently being true see a prior story I related regarding Capcom

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.880
releasing games on PSN odds are this will be true proven true as well well

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.080
that's a and it also bit of a it also makes sense to think about it kind of

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:26.160
eases them into digital distribution with ps3 games because you have the ps2

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.720
games coming out now and I'm assuming those are gonna be at a higher price

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.600
point than the PlayStation 1 games were you know for the most part I would

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:37.440
assume that they're gonna be maybe around you know 15 20 15 to I would say

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:44.120
even 15 to like $30 maybe 15 25 ish and if that does well then of course and I

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:49.120
mean hey let's release some PlayStation 3 games you know for more money as well

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:56.200
and see if we can get away with selling those so I'm not I'm pretty sure we'll

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.520
probably see this stuff layers here all right well let me finish up this email

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:02.780
here on a personal note I do hope that at least the emulator part is shown to

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:06.880
be true me too although I used to have a 60 gigabyte model PlayStation 3 with full

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:10.480
backwards compatibility I no longer had that due to unfortunate circumstances

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:13.680
and was forced to settle for a non backwards compatible model hopefully

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.040
this emulator will allow me to play my ps2 games again well thanks for taking

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.080
this email it's appreciated and keep up the excellent work this email was

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.360
brought to you by Loki's tingle costume which kindly asks him to wear it lol

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:28.260
thus ends the email back tonight mailbag orange launcher calm if you have an

01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:32.240
email you want to send us in a future week sorry I think we'll cost him I do

01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:37.880
believe that you are about 800,000 copies shy in other words yes I made the

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:41.640
costume yet you're gonna have to get to like 50,000 it's never gonna happen

01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:45.280
they've stopped making the game it's done it's not gonna happen done deal you

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:49.080
need yet now all of you should be focusing on a new bet you can get low

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:54.000
you know I am not making any bets on the PSP go I'm sorry I don't know that's

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.400
gonna do because there are a lot of to be honest you know I have a problem with

01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:01.360
people buying the iPhone because I think it's retarded but you know there are

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:06.040
people out there that like to spend a lot of money on stuff that's kind of you

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:09.240
guys are gonna have to think really hard and also Frisbee brings up a good point

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:12.480
Sackboy costume was better anyway let's not forget Loki did dress up as

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:16.600
Sackboy which is pretty exactly I have the head now in my garage I know it

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.760
scared the hell out of me when I first saw it all right some more news then

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.000
we'll get into some release dates and the FUs of the week as well let's see

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:34.320
here so let's talk a little bit about Xbox 360 we've got last M they've got

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:41.680
some information on that and how will be integrated into the new Xbox experience

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:49.040
apparently elastic last FM is gonna be free for gold subscribers however if you

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:56.200
are still remember you do get to use three hours per month and if you're a I

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:03.560
guess you'll have to shell out I guess another $36 a year if you're still

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.280
remember and just want to use last FM which you might as well buy a fucking

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:14.640
gold subscription points yeah might as well so apparently yes silver members

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:20.760
will be able to access I guess trial period of three hours a month and comes

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:25.040
with video advertising which might get into something else we'll talk about in

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:29.600
just a second here and I thought is this isn't now my hope was that I'd be able

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:32.880
to use last FM as my in-game music but that's not really what they're going for

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:37.080
is it this is just gonna be like a cable channel or something I guess yeah I don't

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:40.600
like the cable music channel instant party just add last FM or something I

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:45.440
don't know like I've yet to really hear what is this used for I don't know I

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:48.560
hope you can use like in-game music pretty cool that would be pretty cool

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:53.040
actually is trying out you know the custom soundtracks with fuel the other

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:58.080
day only two funny and it doesn't have the greatest soundtrack it really

01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:02.680
doesn't it's it's got what I like to call excite truck syndrome where you add

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:08.400
new music to it instantly makes the game better you know yeah yeah so I don't

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:14.120
know it it's alright but um I see I've never used last FM on PC so I don't

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.240
really know if it's something that I'd be really excited about to be honest I

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.520
mean I like listening to new music and discovering new artists and stuff but I

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.800
don't think they have as eclectic tastes as I would have you know I don't know I

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.600
guess I'll check it out I am a gold number so too bad it's not live through

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:34.320
CC 5 instead of last FM I know right I'm saying something nice about life is

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:39.760
CC 5 but seriously we might almost consider going back if they could have

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.200
that on the Xbox marketplace how about we do shoutcast I know there you go how

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.560
about shoutcast exactly then you can have all games radio on there and and

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.800
which would include us of course and you know all the other great stations that

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:53.640
come with shoutcast but I don't know maybe an IRC let's add IRC in there too

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.680
and you won't need a PC you can just do it through the 360 exactly that's why I

01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:01.560
would love to have this show is be able to live I mean you can already hear it

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:06.640
on your PSP which is cool but that's like one system out of a lot I guess

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:11.840
it's one nice thing I could say about the PSP is that yeah by the way we

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:15.240
wouldn't really go back to life this is five chat don't panic we're not really

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:20.200
gonna do that besides you know what's funny is that since the show is actually

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:23.120
kind of grown a little bit in numbers since we kind of combined with Bobby and

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.800
we have some of the holdovers from his show and I know he gets a boost from us

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.580
I don't think we could do the show on like these five anymore without being a

01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.880
professional station we have too many people which is a nice compliment

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.840
certainly to you know the the listeners and the fact that the show has grown and

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:40.840
we're very thankful for that we actually could not afford to do this show on

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:44.880
like 365 anymore so don't worry that's not happening I was just making a bad

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:54.680
joke sheesh so it's kind of surprising is to go off completely off topic from

01:44:54.680 --> 01:45:01.040
that Blizzard apparently is not gonna be including land support of course with

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:07.400
the Starcraft 2 game oh I heard about this and a lot of people pissed off

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:13.520
because you know land is I mean how Starcraft 2 and your Starcraft 1 and I

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:16.200
think when you're like counter-strike I mean those are land games right there

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.800
and you know I know land play is a huge thing especially land parties you know

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:25.800
like Korea and stuff and the centers the land party centers exactly well I mean

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.320
they still have play over there you know battle net stuff but I mean it's not the

01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:32.920
same so you can still have a land party it's just that you're all gonna have to

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.800
have an internet connection yeah which in this Wi-Fi day and age shouldn't be

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:41.760
that difficult but still it is kind of crazy I mean if you think about it let

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:46.680
there is more lag I think involved with you know that because you're not just

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:52.120
you're playing off of a local network but I don't know that kind of sucks but

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:56.320
basically you know Blizzard's responding to the whole you removal of it because

01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.720
everyone was pissed off there we don't currently plan to support land play in

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:05.120
Starcraft 2 as we are building battle net to be the ideal destination for

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:08.640
multiplayer gaming with Starcraft 2 and feature Blizzard entertainment games

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.440
while this was a difficult decision for us we felt that moving away from land

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:16.720
play and directing players to our upgrade bell net service was the best

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.720
option to ensure a quality multiplayer experience with Starcraft 2 and

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:26.640
safeguard against piracy as she went under madam chat says hell I'm having a

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:32.960
party next week and we intend on playing mass Starcraft via LAN you know here's

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:36.840
the thing though here's the thing it's not like you can't still get everyone in

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.640
a room together and play this game together you just have to do it on the

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:44.200
internet which I know kind of sucks and they want they want to do that so that

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.360
it validates your copy exactly they're trying to it's piracy yeah they're

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:53.040
trying to curb someone's gonna create a client that's gonna act like battle net

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.320
that you'll connect to that and you'll be able to play land with and guess who

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.520
will be doing that the pirates because they'll figure out a way around this I

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:04.120
kind of agree Blizzard ought to know better than this the that they're gonna

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:07.080
take it out and someone's gonna find a way to put it back in you know what I

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.640
mean it's it they might as well just put it in there and just encourage people to

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:17.800
buy the game legitimately you know have one computer on the land sneak onto the

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.960
internet and see if the other copies are validated certainly there's a way this

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:25.280
could be done certainly like if one computer like creeps onto the internet

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:28.920
battle net could somehow it's kind of tell I don't know I'm just crazy and of

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.440
course you know everyone's pissed off and what happens when people get pissed

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:38.520
off they start a petition and so they have a petition created you know that's

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:44.320
basically insisting that blizzard ad land support back I can't wait for that

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.440
question to be asked at this year's Blizzcon because that is one interesting

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.400
thing about this story is that oops they maybe should have waited to say

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.400
something about this until after Blizzcon but they said something about

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.680
it before so what's gonna be awesome is that now there's gonna be these big

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:00.880
panels on Starcraft then when they take questions why the hell did you take out

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:09.920
land support you douche can't wait next question because we did next question

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:13.600
no they'll say they'll get blah blah blah well we think the marketplace is

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:17.260
shifting and we just wanted to encourage folks to use battle net so that they

01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:20.700
could track their achievements and everything is statistic based and if we

01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:23.920
do the land then we can't have that you're gonna get some talk around

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:30.880
the answer just wait yeah just wait let's talk a little bit about the Dreamcast

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:35.560
yes Dreamcast is of course getting yet another game and much like the

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.560
other you know new games for the Dreamcast that have been coming out

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:46.160
recently is another shmup game the brand-new 2d shoot-em-up game named

01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:56.480
ducks do you X and it's actually being sold I guess right now for $27.90 I'm not

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:59.760
sure if it's gonna be a disk space game or not I guess it could be since you

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:07.160
know Dreamcast can pretty much read any sort of burn disk and apparently I guess

01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:13.720
they have another game that's also coming out as well the company Hugh cast

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:22.120
and it's I guess the title is last hope pink bullets which I guess was

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:29.600
co-developed by the shins hmm which Wow not heard of any of these things

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:36.120
apparently that's actually like the shins like the band the shins huh

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.760
interesting but yeah I mean it's it's still nice to see I guess games coming

01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:48.360
out for the Dreamcast prequel all right well you know what guys I think it's

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.480
time to I get into the F use of the week we wouldn't want to forget it this week

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.920
so we got to get into the F use of the week and of course the story that

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.480
inspires our angst this week

01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:17.160
this has to do with the case of the stolen we this week three teens Josh

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:22.280
Carter and a 16 year old and a 13 year old were all arrested on felony charges

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:25.920
this week because they stole their neighbors we well here's the thing the

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:32.760
mother 41 year old Maxine law actually helped them get rid of the we at a local

01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:37.280
pawn shop she knew damn well the thing was stolen so they stole this thing from

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:41.600
the neighbor and then the parents or the mom I should say parents mom helped them

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:47.520
sell it off at a local pawn shop it was being reported by WF TV in Orlando the

01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.760
Maxine law will probably be charged with dealing in stolen property and

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:56.080
contributing to the delinquency of minors you should know better you stupid

01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:02.960
that makes me angry low-key F use the week I guess F you did not have enough

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:08.480
time to play games and being broke more or less

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:12.880
I don't really have a lot of F use this week I'm generally feeling pretty good

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:15.760
so I guess I would just also give an F you to not having enough hours in the

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.760
day to play video games and F you to Facebook games for being so stupidly

01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:21.760
addicting

01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:28.800
alright let's move on with some more gaming news we got release dates to get

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.120
to two will get to those in a little bit after another couple stories

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:35.640
let's talk about some free games a free yes free is good and these are actually

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:40.080
some pretty good free games both happen to be fighting games on the first one is

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:46.880
a game called vanguard princess and I guess it's a 2d freeware fighter game

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:55.600
developed by a looks like a Tomohaki Sugeno and apparently he is an ex cap

01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:59.840
com employee and the game looks pretty sweet actually you know definitely on

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:04.320
par with like something like guilty gear even and that's available for download

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:14.000
apparently off of a website www.vector.co.jp that's vector and just do a

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:22.440
search for I guess vanguard princess and also the kind of go along with that is a

01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:31.520
game called dark presence and dark presence is a digitized fighting game

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:36.680
very similar to the old Mortal Kombat games and like like Street Fighter the

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:40.040
movie the game where they actually captured the the faces of people they're

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:44.120
making a new game like this yes that is freaking awesome and actually I take

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:51.520
that back this is not a not a free game but apparently new arcade game is not a

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:58.760
new arcade game that's pretty awesome so wow that looks really crappy if it's

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.880
an arcade game I don't know well I was reading something about like it's got

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:05.360
more animation I guess than any game like it has ever existed so it's

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:08.280
supposed to be a smoother looking game then you know the Mortal Kombat games

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:11.320
were which I would hope you know I've been it has been many years the

01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:15.520
technology hopefully to me it looks like one of those cheesy like games that you

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:18.280
would see in a movie or something like that when they're trying to create a

01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:22.360
game in the movie that you know supposed to represent like a Mortal Kombat type

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:27.960
ish game you know something really low-budget but hey whatever if it comes

01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:31.760
out and turns out be cool you know hey Mortal Kombat at the time I think you

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:36.800
know it looks sort of cheesy on a certain level so yeah more power to him

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:41.040
all right let's get into release dates shall we we're gonna travel around the

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:44.640

Japan the next big release Dragon Ball game coming out July 23rd but a little

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.280

pretty busy Major League Baseball 2009 also makes way the PlayStation 2 this

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.680

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:39.000
big thing in Japan this week you get some new peripherals for the DS some

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.480

soul five another port of Major League Baseball 2009 this week and yeah looks

01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:17.880
like this is a big week for baseball in Japan but otherwise nothing else to

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:23.040
really note how about the u.s. u.s. there isn't really a lot of stuff coming out

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:27.200

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:53.960
birthday party bash on the Wii which you know apparently it's a birthday party

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:58.600
kit in the box I don't know if you're a mom maybe that might be interesting for

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:07.560
a little birthday parties for your kids also this week we've got a port of a

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:12.960
game that came out in the UK Sid the dummy which is a crash dummy game

01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:17.960
something that would have probably been popular like 20 years ago coming on PSP

01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:23.320
ps2 and the Wii we release a Bioshock and Elder Scrolls for oblivion kind of

01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:29.560
combined together in the bundle for PC and Xbox 360 the packaged version of

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:33.360
Arma 2 coming on PC which is supposed to be pretty sweet

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:40.160
memento mori on PC and then coming out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:47.600
this week battlefield 1943 also on we wear this week and PC the first chapter

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.440
of the new tales of monkey island series tales of monkey island chapter 1 launch

01:56:52.440 --> 01:57:01.520

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:05.360
is supposed to be coming out on ps3 as well on the PlayStation Network this

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:13.320
week as well so not really a huge huge week no not really next week I mean July

01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:17.680
is really slow for game releases I think next week we've got like NCAA football

01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:22.360
2010 so if you're in the college football that'd be good for you but it

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:25.280
really not a lot of big stuff I think at the end of the month course king of

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:28.760
fires 12 so that'd be cool this time of year is usually a little slow isn't it

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:34.280
it's always slow a little bit hey how about the release dates over in Europe

01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:37.320
since star soccer is not here tonight allow me to say that in Europe you can

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:40.240
look forward to some of the downloads that we get this week as well tales of

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:44.400

01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:06.920
1 8 7 7 game olr to take your calls tonight on anything you want to talk

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:16.120
about apparently according to Sesame Street video games are ok according to

01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:21.720
Sesame Street so as opposed to according to joystick or destructoid or Kotaku or

01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:26.000
one of the big game blogs this week it's according to Sesame Street yes

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:33.340
apparently I see let's see apparently a game changer report issued by Joan

01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:38.400
Ganz Clooney Center from the Sesame Workshop basically says that

01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:42.360
governments the health care industry and schools should be spending less time

01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:47.160
hating on video games and their negative effort our native negative effects and

01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:51.360
said be conducting research on their positive effects on kids the port says

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:55.680
that games not only can be educational but in this day and age active as well

01:58:55.680 --> 01:59:00.800
meaning they can be used everywhere from a history classroom to a PE class and of

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:07.440
course you know they're all saying the Joan Ganz Clooney Center is to foster

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.280
innovation and children's learning through digital media so that's their

01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:18.760
kind of did you hear that Jack Voldemort you listening and yeah that's kind of

01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:26.960
neat I hope we get a song about it that Elmo sings video games okay just do your

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:32.280
homework then you can play hopefully Elmo will never have to explain to

01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:36.400
children what teabagging is in halo

01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:42.520
there's some contest there in there that I want to do about who can write the

01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:50.600
best Sesame Street song for something obscene in gaming nice oh my gosh gold

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:53.520
anthro and chat says another reason that says me Street is awesome first the

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:56.160
death episode and now video games kind of talking about something we talked

01:59:56.160 --> 01:59:57.800
about last week

01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:01.440
all right hey by the way speaking of media I don't know if you guys heard

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:05.880
about this but apparently they want to make a movie out of asteroids yes ah the

02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:10.920
old-ass fucking game from 1979 that many of you know from the Atari 2600

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:17.000
asteroids Universal has somehow gotten the rights to make asteroids the Matthew

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:21.720
Lopez is writing the script it's being produced by Lorenzo de Bonaventura who's

02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:27.160
I know produce some other stuff this is the weird thing apparently they're

02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:30.720
universal is making a lot of movies of some weird shit right now like they they

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:34.160
have the rights to some Hasbro games like battleship in candy land are

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:38.800
supposed to be coming movies as well yeah they picked up a lot of Hasbro stuff

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.280
oh you know what where I've heard Lorenzo de Bonaventura before he's

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:46.720
producing that GI Joe movie that's coming out next pretty big movie so it's

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:50.080
not like these are no-name people but well you know pretty big movie but it's

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:53.760
also gonna be a pretty big flop you think so then again then again

02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:58.520
transformers has a lot of horrible things going for it and it's still did

02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:04.600
very well so who knows by the way the script writer Matthew Lopez had wrote

02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:09.120
the movies bedtime stories and race to which mountain and is also wrote the

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:14.080
most recent draft of the sorcerers apprentice there you have it I don't

02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:19.280
know about that you know I don't know as long as I mean where where's the movie

02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:22.320
in the game I think it there it's not even gonna have a damn thing to do with

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:26.280
the game it's gonna be a space movie called asteroids whoop-dee-doo and what

02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:29.840
is it gonna be trying to be true oh my god I shot the asteroid and it turned

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:36.000
into two smaller asteroids oh no quick shoot the UFO for bonus points it should

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.720
be funnier for those space invaders tiger contest says there's already an

02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:43.840
asteroids movie it's called Armageddon yeah but Armageddon is actually like 10

02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:47.400
years old now believe it or not it's kind of an old movie now and they did

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.400
time for an update blow up the way to make it multiple asteroids leave yeah I

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:55.520
guess that's true please no dancing animal crackers in the asteroids movie

02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:01.160
please no Ben Affleck thank you very much how about we have how many more

02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:05.200
stories you have maybe one more for the skype line two more I don't know I don't

02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:08.080
know let's do one more then we'll open up the skype line if you want to fill

02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:15.360
time with those stories we can okay let's see well I'm not really sad about

02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:20.520
this but apparently NetErosy is being shut down Sony is pulling the plug on

02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.440
the PlayStation 1 development community they're gonna still keep all the

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:28.440
libraries and stuff online but I guess it's officially shut down but honestly

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:32.680
they'll still developing stuff on the PlayStation 1 I mean then again I do say

02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:35.200
that in and there are people developing on the Dreamcast but you know what I

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:37.520
think all the people that were developing for the PlayStation 1 should

02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:40.160
move to the Dreamcast you know because that's the one that seems to be you

02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:43.160
know supported the most and they have a lot of communities for that and stuff

02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:46.440
but well for what it's worth you can play a PlayStation 1 game on the

02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:51.000
PlayStation 3 at least there's that yeah but you can't actually you know publish

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.840
any more PlayStation 1 games and really can only swap you know the games you

02:02:54.840 --> 02:03:00.000
make with the NetErosy with the other NetErosy users and I remember there was

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.640
a time that actually wanted a NetErosy but that didn't happen I was about 15

02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:07.960
years ago all right let's go to the phones they're ringing already one eight

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:10.760
seven seven game olr if you'd like to be on the show tonight but in the meantime

02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:14.480
we have the call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the guy in

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:18.760
East Coast with the fastest trigger Rama hi Rama how are you doing I'm pretty

02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:24.760
good pretty good what cons you go to this week to as I said the tiger claw I

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:29.560
didn't go to any conventions this week I only do the ones are on East Coast I see

02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:32.760
and of course anime expos the big deal on the West Coast this week which by the

02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:38.160
way I should say something about this our staffer DJ tyrant Jimmy who used to

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:44.120
host a show on our old network with DMN I keep this breast lol now they used to

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:47.280
host a show together called STFU he writes for our website once in a while

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:51.000
now he actually got some interviews at anime expo I believe we're gonna have

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.720
the developers of blaze blue on next week in an interview he did so it's

02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:58.680
gonna be weird because it's not an interview we did but we're all about

02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:02.520
getting cool like statements from folks that develop games so I'm gonna kind of

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:05.440
take a listen and and pick the parts we're gonna air next week and then you

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:10.760
get the unedited version on the website there you go that's pretty cool but I

02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:17.800
will say this for the record ax is not a con it's a trade show it's a you know

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.760
what I saw ads for anime Expo up here in Sacramento that's how huge that frickin

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:28.000
thing is well they roll ads for New York anime festival here in New York and on

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.680
on on Adult Swim I'm just saying it's considered a trade show because their

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:37.360
board is consistent mostly people in the anime industry I see and they're mostly

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:42.280
sponsoring the con itself so that it's not fan produced it's pretty much that's

02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:46.520
why Fana may always kind of puts that big fan that they really sell their

02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:51.640
thing on fan made fan produced for the past so many years yeah most cons I've

02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:56.840
gone to especially ones I've staffed and mostly fan based cool well that's cool

02:04:56.840 --> 02:05:03.240
yeah and I'm sorry I would say all the good cons are fan base but um e3 is

02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:07.040
pretty awesome for a trade show so trade shows aren't all bad anyway sorry oh no

02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:10.720
go ahead what else did you want to call in about tonight there's a few things

02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:15.600
that you spoke of tonight wanted to um throw back at you if you don't mind sure

02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:23.000
all right in response earlier about the Sony PSP go and the price as I've been

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:28.040
saying in the chat room for the longest you're paying for the name not the

02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:34.680
product Sony has become the IBM of now cuz back in the 80s and 90s IBM

02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:39.320
machines were quite expensive but people bought his name IBM was on it but the

02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:43.840
only difference was at the time IBM made good quality product Sony not so much

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:48.880
Sony is not Apple they need to realize that Apple can get away with that Sony

02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:54.680
can't I know cuz I don't know if you ever noticed um if you ever pick up like

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:59.240
the Best Buy flyers or when Circuit City was still around in their flyers they're

02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:04.560
always pushing the ps3s with the Sony televisions if you bought the Sony TV

02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:11.560
and the ps3 $200 instant savings or if you bought that with rock band or guitar

02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:17.920
hero world tour you save $300 off the complete bundle hmm it's gotten to the

02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:22.720
point where Sony cannot sell the ps3 anyway in order for them to push them

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:26.840
out they got a bundle it with something you know I'm reading some interesting

02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:30.120
comments from chat room chat that orange laundry calm j-rod and chat says I plan

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:34.920
on buying a PSP go on day one that thing looks pimp as hell don't get me wrong I

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:39.240
think the PSP go looks pretty cool but since I already have PSP there's just

02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:43.200
not enough in it for me I don't know I'm not feeling it for two and I would be

02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:47.800
all over that fucking thing if it was like 150 even exactly the same price as

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:52.680
the current PSP I would be all over it but it's the it's that 250 it's ah I

02:06:52.680 --> 02:07:00.080
can't I can't do it I'm sorry mmm anyway I don't blame you seriously I don't

02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:04.840
yeah but you're Sony hater I'm just kidding no I just speak the truth you

02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:07.440
know that all right look anything else before I let you go and get some more

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:12.320
callers two quick things number one at the we was all about motion control

02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:16.640
would have a shit ton of shovelware games on and as for Starcraft 2 you

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:20.720
don't have a shit ton of shovelware games on it where have you been say what

02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:24.040
it does have a shit ton of shovelware games on it where have you been say if

02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:26.960
it wasn't for the fact that it was focused on the motion control there

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:31.720
wouldn't be as much shovelware oh okay my bad my bad yeah gotcha I'm oh I've

02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:36.040
been told it's only like two games I own for the week every all the other ones I'd

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:43.240
borrowed cuz you know yeah and what was the other thing I'm all about Starcraft

02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:46.720
you're not needing land support it doesn't cost that much to put in a internet

02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:52.160
connection a router and a 24 port switch to get everybody up and running together

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:57.600
does it do you think it's really gonna have that same feeling though well if

02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:01.320
they do it where you log in via the application it shouldn't be that much of

02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:05.560
an issue because it milk I have the same lag time as if you're in the same room

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:10.680
you know no depends on who's hosting or all that crap you know I guess true true

02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:16.400
all right well thanks for your thoughts Rama and good luck from later j-rod I

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:20.400
wanted to clarify we were saying earlier he says I don't own a PSP so that's why

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:24.360
it's probably so attractive to me yeah I'd be I'd probably be a little more

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:31.880
about the PSP if I didn't already own one but still 250 I don't know hi you're

02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:42.480
on orange launch radio who's this hello you're on orange hello hi who's this

02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:51.200
hi who is this is Marissa yes hi what's on your mind Marissa

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:57.480
well thanks again I just had to say a belated congrats for last week I wasn't

02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:01.200
able to listen in although I heard it was a good show it was a pretty good

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:04.160
show it sadly hasn't hit the podcast feed because I'm a lazy son of a bitch

02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:07.480
but it will be hitting it very soon and you guys can hear was that it was a

02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:12.320
kind of a little bit of a throwback to the old days it was cool yeah you know

02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:18.440
as far as my own gaming week this this fourth of July weekend consisted of

02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:25.200
watching Chris play Call of Duty and and how is that is this is this fun to watch

02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:31.320
just play you know actually for some reason it puts me to sleep I don't know

02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:34.680
what it is the sound of killing and bullets but I just curl up like a cat in

02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:38.800
front of his feet and I fall asleep all the sounds of murder just make me

02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:47.440
tired yeah I've actually distracted myself with that old you know you're

02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:51.920
talking about people doing doing you know making games for Dreamcast and

02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:57.560
whatnot no systems I distracted myself with Adam all the adventure game engine

02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:02.560
and was playing an alien race game oh yeah the one you linked me to that

02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:09.760
looks kind of freaky-deaky but tell us a little bit about this game alien rape

02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:14.280
escape or something if you know me I love all the old adventure games oh well

02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:18.520
how do you feel about the new monkey island game coming out I haven't even

02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:22.480
heard about that to you now so that's cool you know I never got into monkey

02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:26.600
island even I was younger you know I love a king's quest people and the

02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:30.600
quest for glory people get mad at me but and Indiana Jones or the state of

02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:36.040
Atlantis person but I try to remember that the state of Atlantis is going to

02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:40.960
be bundled with the new indie game whoo yeah that's right yeah I remember us

02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:43.920
reporting on the show a few weeks ago that it was gonna be coming on the Wii

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:46.280
with the game or something like that someday I don't know if it was a

02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:50.480
pre-order it's been a while now but I I do I did hear that same thing on the

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:55.120
show I'm still obsessing over the announcement now we made that a new

02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:59.280
feast is going to come out but I hadn't just praying every night that I don't

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:08.600
fuck it up isn't how it always goes with old franchises though when they

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:11.160
announce that there's a new one coming out you just pray that they're not gonna

02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:16.240
fuck it up yeah well I guess the thing is like one of those took over for

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:19.880
looking glass although I didn't I actually like the X you know via the

02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:23.760
platform game the Xbox game at deadly shadows most of the purists didn't like

02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:28.600
it and it gets started out kind of lame because they called it a thief with a

02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:34.560
four instead of the odd or something and suddenly like that so it's like four

02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:38.760
four something now I don't know how to pronounce it but I guess it's just a

02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:45.080
working title indeed well Marissa I need to come visit us soon and come be on the

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:49.440
show again I'm hoping that'll happen and you have anything else you want to share

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:53.960
with listeners tonight before we get to some more calls nothing that wouldn't be

02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:59.520
sublimely silly so I have have a good night and hopefully I will be seeing you

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:08.880
feeling and you need to call so-and-so all right we'll do honey take care I think

02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:13.760
I think we lost her there we go okay well I do hope Marissa comes back to

02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:16.400
visit it's been like a hundred episodes since she's been here she's a lot of fun

02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:19.240
I've been that long she's like it's I know we've been doing the show a fucking

02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.600
long time I don't know if you're aware we have another call coming on hi you're

02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:25.200
on orange launch radio oops we didn't really answer that call hi you're on

02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.280
orange launch radio who's this hi this is fancy Nader hi spazz Nader what's on

02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:36.360
your mind tonight um two things which are kind of related to some degree go

02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:42.280
ahead all right you know I was you know you know you know thinking about that

02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:49.080
comment you were making about you know someone's making asteroids movie yes

02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:54.440
question is how the hell do you make a movie on the asteroid there's like no

02:12:54.440 --> 02:13:02.560
narratives there I mean I can I I can see a movie being here like I'm charted

02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:09.000
or no dear salad there's a narrative there but easy the same way the same way

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.320
dude they're making movies out of battleship in candy land they are movies

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:17.840
in name only or Pirates of the Caribbean there was really no plot to it you know

02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:21.760
in the ride but they managed to make three movies and they actually were

02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:25.400
pretty good now asteroid could be something similar where they just make

02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:28.200
up characters and then now those characters are associated with that

02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:31.680
franchise so and maybe that's what they want to do maybe it's type of agreement

02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:36.200
where if they could do a good movie then they can re-release the asteroid game

02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:39.640
with the characters in it just like they ended up going back and putting the

02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:43.360
characters in the ride or more importantly had huge amounts of

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:46.680
merchandising with the parrot Pirates of the Caribbean movies I mean that the you

02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:49.600
know Jack Sparrow figures still sell like crazy and you see tons of them at

02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:54.200
Halloween you know he's a he's a universally loved character so I guess

02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:56.920
that's a good point I didn't even think about if they do write the movie well

02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:00.600
enough there there will be an audience for it but there's just not a lot of

02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:03.920
source material to base it off of what do we know about the asteroid movie it

02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:07.600
will be about asteroids there will probably be shooting of said asteroids

02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:12.960
that's it that's all the script requires in some ways it's guaranteed to piss

02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:16.240
people off less than like the Harry Potter movies like how many people

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.000
hated the third Harry Potter movie because of all the shit they cut out

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:26.280
sometimes it's nice to have a very thin narrative but I wouldn't you know I my

02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:30.520
expectations for this movie are not going to be I guess that high because of

02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:34.080
the fact there's no narrative to base it off of if that makes sense I don't know

02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:41.120
well it could very well be good you know for all I know obviously I haven't seen

02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:47.240
it so I can't be sure but you know I could be a little skeptical you know to

02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:50.520
say the least well we should be skeptical it's ten dollars and twenty

02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:54.280
five cents of our money we're gonna be spending on the movies anyway what was

02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:58.880
the other thing you want to mention tonight oh yeah I forgot to mention in

02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:04.400
my email because I can't really mention you know I wrote it but uh I kept it

02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:11.640
notes earlier earlier this week and on the PlayStation Network store the only

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:17.720
time that the video site they got a reasonably new or new for the store

02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:23.160
enemy series that may be appealing to some of the listeners out there it's a

02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:32.440
devil may cry series mm-hmm and well I got popped up the first episode to try

02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:38.320
it out and for one thing it looks pretty good I don't know about the entire

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:45.040
series as a whole but just based on the first episode it looks pretty good so I

02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:49.640
don't know if any of the listening wants to check it out or you guys but really

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:53.600
start the first ones you know worth checking out you know that's one thing I

02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:57.160
have yet to do on the Sony marketplace is check out one of the TV shows or

02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.400
something but that's cool I know they've been kind of releasing some more anime

02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:03.920
and things like that sort of like there's a whole Street Fighter store now

02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:06.760
and on the PlayStation 3 I was checking out this week and they actually have

02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:11.440
like the Street Fighter anime and some of that stuff so kind of different yeah

02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:18.620
I think I mentioned in a previous email going back several weeks ago that I had

02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:27.840
recommended the first angel anime series I happen to have all 24 episodes and at

02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:33.480
least that series is very good it's kind of how to describe it's like a cross

02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:39.420
between actually has certain elements of specs files and a little bit of

02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:48.080
Charlie's Angels mixed in yeah it's kind of odd but in a good way definitely

02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:51.440
definitely worth checking out and that's a bit is that available on on Sony's

02:16:51.440 --> 02:17:04.520
marketplace yeah yeah it is I think I can't you know remember the name of the

02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:10.040
developer but you know it's not funimation right and that's for sure but

02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:14.200
it's pretty good all right I will definitely have to check that out on the

02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:17.040
marketplace at some point but thank you so much for the call spaz nator you have

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:24.040

02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:40.320
call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this is excellent hi

02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:44.320
excellent what's on your mind buddy hey hey I have a quick question for you

02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:48.760
guys how can a developer bring out a PC version of a game that's really great

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:52.320
and really good but yet have so many buggy and lot of cool issues it's not

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:55.760
even funny to even start to mention how many stuff there is wrong with the game

02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:00.320
are you saying it's a PC game that came out yeah Ghostbusters a video game the

02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:05.560
PC version is absolutely horrid easy it's not I mean there's so many complaints

02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:09.720
from so many people they're not even issuing any patches or they're not

02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:13.360
issuing any kind of you know saying hey look we were sorry we're trying to get

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:19.840
on this super duper super duper easy answer for you and what the one kind of

02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:24.200
problem that I suppose that PC games have in general is that there is not the

02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:29.620
same quality control that you have on the PlayStation or the Microsoft system

02:18:29.620 --> 02:18:33.700
or even the Nintendo system is that these games go through no quality

02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:38.680
control remember when way back when they used to have the Nintendo seal of

02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:43.240
quality yes the Nintendo seal quality had nothing to do with the fact whether

02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:46.480
the game was any good or not it just had to do with the fact that the game had

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:49.960
been officially tested was officially licensed and approved for the system and

02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:53.920
usually the games that were like really prone to bugs and had really bad

02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:56.680
ingression a lot of really bad things wrong with them were these games that

02:18:56.680 --> 02:19:01.160
came out from color dreams and the other makers attention and makers that wanted

02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:04.840
nothing to do in Nintendo kind of moving on from that now you have a lot of these

02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:08.440
companies where you can't even really put the games out on the system unless

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:12.720
you go through these rigid tests you know a quality control you know and it's

02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:19.600
it's little as you know in like the Xbox games you have to have you know things

02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:23.440
have to be referred to as the r1 and the l1 or the back button in the start

02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:27.240
button and then the Sony games the X button and O button you know that you

02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:30.520
have to make sure everything is referred to by the proper name for it I mean it's

02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:34.480
down to that kind of level of control on the PC who's there to control those

02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:38.960
games what third-party entity has to look at those games and and review them

02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:43.200
nobody nobody's really watching that I think it should be more viewing done

02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:46.960
because like I said before I feel now I'm they kind of gypped out of my money

02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:50.560
for the game and how they're looking actually forward to playing it on the PC

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:55.840
and it's like now to go out and find a way to get it for either the 360 now or

02:19:55.840 --> 02:20:00.040
the ps3 in full quality and tour you know to play it till they come out some

02:20:00.040 --> 02:20:04.360
kind of patch you know and it's just like I mean there's been more than one

02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:07.520
more than one instance with more than one person saying hey look there's these

02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:11.120
kind of problems I'm running on a you know high-end system and yet it's still

02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:15.840
running like it's on a 386 computer so it's like what's going on here so

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:19.200
interesting comment from Xenocore in the chat room I want to kind of run this by

02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:24.000
you there is no way an all-encompassing quality control can be run on PC games

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.680
there are way too many combinations for hardware you can check all you want and

02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:32.880
still find bugs after release I didn't have any issues running Ghostbusters but

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:37.960
it does it done have secure on it however good point is that you know when

02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:42.080
on the PlayStation on the Xbox at least you have the same hardware so there is

02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:44.880
something to kind of but but you don't know what components are going to go

02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:48.280
into those PC games so how can you really audit them I always thought the

02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:52.960
games for Windows was kind of one of those types of things was a way to have

02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:57.160
the game's quality controlled but I guess he brings up a good point you

02:20:57.160 --> 02:21:01.440
can't really test every hardware combination out there but yeah it's true

02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:04.960
that's very true and I just I was kind of weird because like I said I play

02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:08.640
Fallout 3 and everyone's perfect I have no problems or anything whatsoever I

02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:11.720
played this and it's like the whole thing is getting ready to crash at given

02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:18.800
points it's like I just thought was kind of interesting I just well I'm sorry here

02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:22.360
the game runs like crap x-link I would still continue to pressure the

02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:26.240
developers professionally you know write a letter post on the forums what have

02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:29.240
you get you know the other people you know they've been having problems of the

02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:32.720
game to continue to helm them and you know say you're not going to support

02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:36.520
them in the future if they don't fix their crap most definitely I hear you

02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:40.600
I hear on that excellent good luck buddy and take care okay thank you no problem

02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:44.600
thank you but bye and Xenocore in chat kind of makes a good point to secure on

02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:47.320
games kind of have a reputation for running like crap that's something

02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:52.960
important to state as well so I think we are gonna go ahead and wrap up the

02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:55.880
skyline for tonight I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through but we do

02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:58.960
want to wrap up and get out of here before it's too late tonight it's

02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:02.280
already getting close to nine o'clock midnight on the East Coast do you have

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:05.000
any other quick stories one to get out there Loki yeah that's a quick stuff

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:11.600
real quick there is a website apparently it's a book project that this guy's

02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:17.840
doing called there will be brawl and it's the artist names Greg death Greg

02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:23.680
DeStefano and you can look at the pictures that they have there on www.

02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:31.520
Greg DeStefano.com that's g-r-e-g-d-e-s-t-e-f-a-n-o.com and they've got some

02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:37.720
pretty interesting pictures sadly enough that Icarus guy looks like Shane that's

02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:46.440
kind of funny and wait let me see let me see it's sort of he maybe if Shane took

02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:55.080
hardcore drugs how about a Wario's John Goodman yeah sort of okay that I see a

02:22:55.080 --> 02:23:00.960
little more yes okay there you go but yeah it's interesting and then other

02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:08.560
things there's some cool rumors going on including that there's gonna be some

02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:12.720
little big planet download content coming soon themed after the Ghostbusters

02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:16.280
actually this is probably less of a rumor because it's actually on media

02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:21.480
molecules website and they have just in white text on black background who you

02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:26.280
gonna call and of course that's from Ghostbusters so makes perfect sense that

02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:30.200
will probably seen some stuff pretty soon from that probably just costumes

02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:35.600
though the Hanabi festival is coming back in Europe and there's actually a

02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:42.320
pretty good lineup of games coming with that including I saw they had an ogre

02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:48.080
battle which is pretty cool ogre battle from the Super Nintendo pulse man from

02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:55.880
the Sega Mega Drive bomber man 94 on turbo graphics 16 detonate twin be on

02:23:55.880 --> 02:24:01.160
also the turbo graphics Kirby's dreamland 3 on Super Nintendo

02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:08.940
Musha on Sega Mega Drive smash table tennis on the NES and zodas revenge

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:15.240
star tropics to all these coming to virtual console during the month of July

02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:20.000
and yes that's kind of neat yeah so that's pretty awesome Star Trek Star

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.360
Trek star tropics to never come out over there no I guess not interesting over

02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:30.960
here yes there no so that's starting actually as of last Friday so some of

02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:35.280
that stuff's already out and dark soccer would be all over that to Tana Twimby

02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:39.040
coming out I know she was a fan of that yes so that's pretty cool

02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:47.160
um Konami a guest is also confirmed that they're gonna be porting over contra

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:54.120
rebirth for Europe in August and also drift mania with two eyes also coming to

02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:59.840
we wear as well so you drift drift mania I guess that's how you pronounce that

02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:06.480
top-down racing game and you know those are coming to Europe so that means that

02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:10.120
they're localizing it for English so hopefully we'll see those over here as

02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:17.240
well this is kind of a neat rumor apparently TMNT smash-up is going to be

02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:20.760
getting some other characters that aren't necessarily in the Ninja Turtles

02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:25.200
universe apparently they're also going to be getting two rabid characters one

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:30.240
of them is rumored to be dressed up as Sam Fisher from of course the splinter

02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:35.400
cell series and then also rabid dressed up as a cheerleader and those are

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:39.180
supposed to be in you know the all-term Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighting

02:25:39.180 --> 02:25:43.360
game which is kind of interesting that's some more characters they're shown for

02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:46.600
that and it's actually some stuff from the comic that I'm not even familiar

02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:50.040
with and then lastly I just have to mention this because I remember this

02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:54.680
when I had a graphing calculator in high school that they were trying to port

02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:59.000
this to the TI-83 but finally Link's Awakening has been ported to the TI-83

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:04.360
oh my god and it's been that long that I've been waiting you know I remember

02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:07.160
this coming out and it's like oh my god Link's Awakening we can play it on the

02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:12.840
TI-83 but really like those little graphing calculators can handle the

02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:17.360
processing they can have you show me the video they can hack them so that it's an

02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:23.360
assembly and stuff I guess it's awful sound quality but uh you know the you

02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:26.560
know graphics are just it's okay the graphics are kind of crap but well I

02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.320
mean it's a graphic and it's slow but yeah it's a graphing calculator running

02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:34.840
the game that's crazy and I think that a lot of the stuff they probably just

02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:37.600
programmed from scratch I don't think it's actually being emulated yeah I

02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:40.920
can't imagine this is any fun to actually play this is just more of an

02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:44.720
accomplishment than anything else but yeah I mean I remember you know back in

02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:50.200
the day it used to be you know this is back when they first started porting a

02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:56.640
like assembly stuff to the TI-85 and you can hack the calculator to run faster

02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:01.400
than it normally could and you could do grayscale games and stuff like that the

02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:05.760
days this is why I quit my calculus class because I was too busy programming

02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:15.480
games nice but uh yeah and that's all I have right now all right wow we're made

02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:18.280
it we're to the end of the show I know it's a little earlier than last week but

02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:21.280
we're kind of at the end of the show and that's okay cuz I don't know about you

02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:23.640
guys but after this holiday weekend I still have some things I'm trying to

02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:27.480
take care of before I go back to work tomorrow after this whole three-day work

02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:32.440
weekend so yeah we're gonna go ahead and wrap things up and get on out of here

02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:36.400
for the night but thank you guys so much for listening tonight and sadly dark

02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:39.760
soccer is not here either and you know she'll usually help banter with us for a

02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:41.960
little while and bring her stories to table she's not here so I think it's

02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:45.200
gonna be the end of the show believe it or not we're done we're out of here

02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:48.800
which is also actually it's good because it gives me a chance to make sure I can

02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:53.560
get on the network and get those other get the files that I need to upload the

02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:56.320
show later this week because I don't want the podcast people have to wait any

02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:01.160
longer so we're out of here believe it or not that's it have a great night

02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:04.920
everybody let's go around everybody's final thoughts Loki your final thought

02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:10.000
my final thought is I'm watching and someone actually took a DS light and

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:16.040
they've managed to turn it into an arcade cabinet or I should say put a DS

02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:21.600
in an arcade cabinet that's crazy Wow my final thought is instead of spending

02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:25.000
$400 on a laptop I should have just bought myself an arcade cabinet for my

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.920
house I would have been fun the real love that you know in hindsight like I

02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.800
said I think before I rather bought see because we're in an apartment complex in

02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:38.760
order to have the whole thing delivered it comes on a pallet and I mean you

02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:42.680
can't deliver a pallet of stuff to an apartment complex you're gonna get

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:47.080
people looking at you funny and but man that would have been the way I've gone

02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:52.520
it costs like a sixth of what I paid for it and just you know looks so much nicer

02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:57.240
