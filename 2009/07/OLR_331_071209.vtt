Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, July 12, 2009. Can piracy lead to malware on your DS?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
The Tomb Raider franchise looks ready for a reboot.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
And could you soon play Rock Band or Guitar Hero with no gaming console?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello, Internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
And here to do it with you guys every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Joining me tonight, the one and only tech master, Loki, in the house.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hello.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
How you doing, Loki?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Doing good.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Awesome.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And DarkSakura is joining us a little bit late.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
She is in her summer class right now, and as you know, she's been having to join us late for some of the shows

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
because she has some type of outdoor activity she has to do.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Some type of PE class, so she, I think, some type of class she has to do outdoor activities for.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
She'll probably tell us more about that when she comes on.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
She should be live with us in about 15 minutes, so not too long.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I know she wasn't here last week, so we have a lot of DarkSakura catching up to do.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
And then, of course, you guys join us every week in our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Our phone line is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Our email bag, mailbag, orangelaungeradio.com.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
It's not just about us, it's about you guys.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
We are the place where every gamer has a voice.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Anyhow, it's been a fun week, I hope, for you guys out there.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Just another summer week for those of you folks that are on a break from school or what have you.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I hope you're making the most of it and getting some good gaming time in.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
We're going to start off the show tonight, as we always do, talking about our gaming weeks a little bit.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
I was just playing Grand Theft Auto IV, just still tweaking the editing to make sure everything's balanced.

01:58.000 --> 02:08.000
I was creating one weapon that's basically a nuke, and it wasn't getting to the size that a nuke should be.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
Or at least, you know, relatively in scale. Obviously, if I actually created a full-sized nuke in the game,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
that would kind of be pointless since it would destroy the entire map.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
But I want something a little bit bigger than, say, 20 square feet or something like that.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
So I'm working on making that a little bit bigger. I think I figured out a way to do it.

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
But it's funny, because we just can't stop giggling once we fire that, and the whole screen gets this big bright green glow,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
and everything explodes, and it's funny.

02:44.000 --> 02:54.000
But yeah, the game has gotten so ridiculous now that it's just an absolute blast, and really kind of not resembling Grand Theft Auto anymore.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
Now, you talk a lot about your Grand Theft Auto playing on the show, and I think we all kind of have the grasp

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
that you do this on your lunch break at work. This is how you guys...

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Lunch break and our 15-minute break.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Wow, so it's all gaming. Because, again, for those folks that are new to Orange Lancerado and maybe haven't listened before,

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Loki works in game distribution, so he literally for eight hours a day kind of eats, lives, sleeps video games.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
But it's not as glamorous as some of you might think, because he's actually selling video games to little independent stores.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Not GameStops, but independent video game stores, right? So you're kind of like the middleman there.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
So you have to be a salesman. But instead of selling used cars, you're selling new video games.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
So, all right. A wild dark soccer is approaching. Quick, throw the pester ball!

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
She just got out of the shower.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
All right, she'll be joining us in just a moment. Anyway, she came in to make faces in the studio.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, so you play actual video games on your lunch break to kind of decompress and stuff, and the guys you play with,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
are they all also like game salesmen, or what's the deal?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Well, here's the deal. One way or another, they sort of are.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
I mean, before we used to have a mix, we had just all of our game reps playing.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
Right now, we have myself, my friend Jason, who actually moved into the games department, so now he's a game sales rep.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
Our friend Rob Nelson, who's in our video sales department, but way back in the day, he was actually in game sales,

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
and he likes games, so that's cool. And then my boss, Rob, who's also...

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Wait, so you play video games on lunch with your boss?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
That's actually kind of cool. Your job ain't so bad.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
But I kick the crap out of him a lot.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Nice. I wish I could play Grand Theft Auto with my boss.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
But the thing is...

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Of course, I don't think she really plays video games.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
No, because we play on the consoles that I own, I've modded all those consoles, so now I can take an image of Grand Theft Auto IV.

04:50.000 --> 04:59.000
Granted, I have bought copies, so I guess sort of it's legal, because I do actually own enough copies for all the systems.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
I actually have lost and damned on all the systems, so that's pretty expensive.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
But yeah, so we actually do play modified copies of Grand Theft Auto IV, but we play with our own ruleset.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
And really, since we're not playing with anybody else other than our group, we're not getting banned.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
I mean, despite the rumors, oh, if you play with a modded console and a modded disc or a backup or something like that on Live, you're gonna get banned.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, we've been doing it for a while now, and really I think it takes someone reporting you and that kind of stuff.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
But yeah, we're just having fun with our custom weapons, and I try to modify everything so that it's kind of balanced.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
But it's just absolutely crazy, and I am planning on filming it this week.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
I finally found my video capture device.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Thank God, because our YouTube needs a little love.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
We put up a handful of videos from E3, but our YouTube could always use some more love.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I know we have our YouTube fans out there.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, so I'm gonna try to film it this week.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
I just have to get enough footage to edit it together to make it interesting, but it's absolutely crazy.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
It's seriously just explosions going off every which way.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah, it's nuts.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
Speaking of video, I just kind of want to get out there, because some folks that listen to Orange on this Radio have been asking,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
when is Justin TV gonna come back?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
The webcam feed that we used to have, when is that gonna come back?

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
Probably around Labor Day, and I know that's a way out, and I apologize to those folks that were relying on Justin TV to kind of listen to the show live,

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
because for whatever reason, I guess shoutcast ports are blocked, but they could get in through Justin TV.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
We have some very naughty people who listen to us at work overseas.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Naughty, naughty, but no, we appreciate the support.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Either way, just don't get fired over Orange on this Radio.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
But we have some folks that would listen, and I know they were using Justin TV to do it,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
and some folks, for whatever weird reason, like to look at us while we're doing this,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
but we would also play video games, usually during the show.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
I know towards the end there, before the summer months, we would kind of show games before they were actually out,

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
because Loki is also a crazy import gamer, and would get a lot of games from Japan that he can play on his Wii,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
so we were doing a lot of that.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
So we are gonna bring that back, probably around Labor Day.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
There's just some other things we have to answer.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
We actually still have the donated computer as well, which is gonna help in large part with this,

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
because depending on where we end up, we're either gonna go to a larger space here in Studio Dark Sakura,

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
where all the pinball is now, or we're going to go back to Studio My Place, and the place that's there.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
So either way, we're looking at getting a more intricate setup with Justin TV,

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
where we're gonna have a switchboard, where we can go between like a shot of us in studio,

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
a shot of the game we're playing, maybe something that's a zoom in on the guest or something like that.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Kind of some multi-camera angles, believe it or not, should be interesting.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
So we'll see what happens. That is hopefully in the future.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Anyway, I didn't mean to derail your gaming week, Loki, but I don't know if you have anything else.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Death Wishing says I should make a gun that shoots fish. Can't do that, unfortunately, in Grand Theft Auto.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
You can make guns that shoot a lot of things, but fish is not one of those things.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Tigerclaw is asking why not Studio Loki if it exists.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
Well, I just think with babies on the way, Studio Loki's not really gonna be a viable option,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
plus I don't think you have really any extra space there.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
The middle bedroom, but it's kind of...

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Small. Well, so is this space. We make this work.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah, actually, it would be bigger than this space.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
I think Studio Loki is always a possibility in a situation where one of us is gonna be gone or something,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
but, you know, especially once Loki has the kids there.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I will have an HDTV in there, hopefully.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
The wife keeps seeing that I can't put it in there. She's like, well, you have to put it in our bedroom.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
I'm like, well, I don't have cable locks for that, so...

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
Dark Sakura is toweling off from the shower. In fact, she's wearing nothing but a towel right now.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Too bad that we don't have that Justin TV heft up, right?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Whatever.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
No, she's not. She's wearing very unglamorous sweatpants and a DDR spot t-shirt.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
These aren't sweatpants. These are actually comfortable man pajamas.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
I'm sorry. From a distance, they look like sweatpants. Well, what's on your mind, Dark Sakura? How are you doing?

08:51.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, I was actually gonna say we actually had another idea about doing some rearranging that would involve opening up a whole wall in this room.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Dang.

09:00.000 --> 09:09.000
So that would give us... In fact, it was actually almost specifically for us using this as a studio full-time.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Nice.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
So we would be making some more room in here. We're actually thinking about moving the pinballs into that room and moving our living room into the pinball room.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
And for that sake, that actually moves the subwoofer away from that back wall so that we're not getting...

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Oh, and by the way, Sega did BOOM!

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
I look forward to the week where Sega does BOOM!

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
That would be a great video game, actually. Just call it BOOM with an explanation.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Copyright Orange Jones Radio 2009, blah blah.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
We haven't had a dream game in a long time called BOOM.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Or a dream game in a long time.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
It just needs to be called subwoofer noise.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, Dark Soccer, since you're joining us now, welcome back, by the way. You were out last week because you were in Vegas. How was Vegas?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
It was hot.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Of course.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
And when it got hot, it got hotter. And then it was alright.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
I had a very good time. We actually did have some rain coming back from the Hoover Darn.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah?

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Sorry, my little brother, Phillip. So cute when he was little. Then he grew up. What happened?

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
He used to call it the Hoover Darn because dam was a bad word.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Because dam's a bad word, right.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah. So I sort of inherited calling it the Hoover Darn. But anyway, we went to the Hoover Dam.

10:19.000 --> 10:26.000
And it was hot. And there was water.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
And big.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I took pictures of said water.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Thank God you're here because I would have never known that.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh, whatever. God, where the hell is my IRC? Okay.

10:35.000 --> 10:43.000
Anyway, we got lots of frozen yogurt. And I had a few very cool new experiences.

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
And met cool people that I had heard of but never got to see. So it was pretty cool. I had a very good time.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Wait, did you meet OLR listeners? Or were these like other people?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Other people.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Oh, okay.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Because I went to go see Sauce.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Okay. Because tiara friends.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Okay, okay.

11:00.000 --> 11:08.000
And I had a really great, great time. It was very relaxing. I watched the first season of Dexter.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
I love that show. I watched the first season of True Blood. I love that show, too.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
And I finally got to see Repo, the genetic opera.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yes.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
God, I love Anthony Head and that. He's just like, oh!

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I love Repo in general. Well, you know, if you're a long time-

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
And it's the only thing I've seen Sarah Brightman in that her voice hasn't irritated me.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
Oh, she's amazing. By the way, if you've listened to this show for any length of time, or I guess I should say a long time,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
you know that I've been involved with Rocky Horror Picture Show for a long time.

11:38.000 --> 11:48.000
And Repo really is kind of like a lot like it in a sense where it's that very like kind of glamorous kind of musical type thing.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
So I love Repo. It's awesome.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
I really do. I really do enjoy it. I'm gonna have to pick that up on Blu-ray so I can watch it in all the HD glory.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
I have an extra copy on Blu-ray if you want to buy one cheap because I got an extra one for my birthday.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Alright.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
So if you're interested in it, let me know.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I'm interested in it.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Okay, cool.

12:06.000 --> 12:14.000
But I also actually did a little bit of gaming. I actually brought some games that we never got to play.

12:14.000 --> 12:24.000
But I got my SNES emulator running on Linux and I played some of the game that we'll be talking about later.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I see. So we're gonna have an inspired Classic Game of the Week this week.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Yes, we will.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Awesome.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
And it's not Captain America and the Avengers. We did purchase that actually. Dan and I did when I got back.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Goldanthro in our chatroom at chat.orangelawnsradio.com put,

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
Lol, my mom is watching True Blood right now in my family's living room. No joke. She loves that show.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Dad, that show's awesome.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
True Blood is also a trending topic on Twitter right now, I notice, since I'm checking the OLR accounts.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
So it must be a good show. I've never watched it.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
It's pretty good. It's pretty good. It's just something you'll have to watch.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
It's like vampires and stuff, right?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah, but it's vampires going public.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Interesting. Okay.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
It's got a lot of human rights parallels and different things.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
So like heroes, but with vampires?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
I didn't watch Heroes.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, okay.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
So that's kind of lost on me.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
But we also saw Drag Me to Hell.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
And we paid $2 apiece for it, so it was well worth the money.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
It was like, I think either that or The Hangover, and I hate stupid-

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Buddy comedies.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
I really do. I really don't like those kind of movies.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
And while other people may love them to death, that's fine. I'm not saying that your taste is awful.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I'm just saying that's not my kind of thing.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
So, um, but going to see a Sam Raimi movie, you know, how can you go wrong with Sam Raimi?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Loki's dying to say something.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Oh, I was just going to say what I saw this week, too.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
I saw Transformers Revenge of the Fallen and Bruno, and I never have I seen so many people walk out of Bruno.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
It was hilarious.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
I'm iffy on Bruno because I have this bad feeling I'm going to get really offended even though I usually find that kind of stuff funny.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
It was funny.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
I'm waiting for Blu-ray.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Natalie loved the movie.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Did she? Of course she did.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm just going to wait for Blu-ray.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
There's so many other movies I want to see in the theater right now.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
I have not seen Transformers.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
The boyfriend talked me into seeing- actually it was a mutual agreement.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Like, because he wanted to see Transformers, but I was a little eh, and I wanted to see this other movie.

14:15.000 --> 14:24.000
He was kind of a little eh, so we agreed to go see My Sister's Keeper, which is basically like the biggest, like, vagina of a movie ever.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
It's a total chick film, and we just cried through the whole thing like big girls.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
But, um, you know, it was good, I guess.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
It was sad.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I showed you the picture of what I saw that made me think of you.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, yes. What? The big pink penguin?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
The pink penguin in a tutu?

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
I'm not sure how to take this, because, you know, sure, I'm gay or whatever, but I like to think I'm still a guy.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Because you like pink ones.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I do love pink ones.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Actually, I'll tell you why it made me think of you.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Why?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Because of Rocky.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It's true.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
When, when, um, he did the cell block, uh, pingo.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Oh, god, that was so many years ago.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Okay, yeah, yeah.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
And you were wearing the little pink-

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
You know, you know, you're not helping my whole manly man case here, so if, uh, you wouldn't mind telling us about the rest of your gaming week.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
But it wasn't, don't jump to conclusions.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
Anyway, um, I played a lot of pinball.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
We went to the pinball hall of fame, and, um, I was in pain by the time we were done, but it was well worth the agony.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
Um, I played the worst pinball table ever, and it's also one of the most rare.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I played pinball circus.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
It's crap.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
It's worth playing once, but it's crap, and that's probably why they only made two of them.

15:33.000 --> 15:41.000
Um, I played, uh, I actually went and played a really good, um, Black Knight, um, 2000.

15:41.000 --> 15:49.000
Because, you know, I've got the table, but ours is kind of messed up, so playing on our messed up table here helped my skills on the really nice table there.

15:49.000 --> 16:00.000
And we had, um, Tiara and I took turns, sort of, um, on the longest multi-ball session ever of Star Trek The Next Generation.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
And I played the Data East Star Trek pinball. I played, um, I did not play Captain Fantastic, sorry.

16:06.000 --> 16:13.000
Um, but I did play, um, Theater of Magic, and I played, um, Medieval Madness.

16:13.000 --> 16:21.000
I played, um, the Super Mario Brothers pinball table. The adult one, not the child one.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
Um, and I played, uh, Bride of Pinbot and Pinbot. They didn't have a jackpot.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
I was actually, I wandered around the place twice looking for a jackpot, but they didn't have one.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
But it's okay. They had, they had Doctor Who. I didn't play, though.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
No, where is this place? I'm sorry, I missed that part.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
It's the Pinball Hall of Fame.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Oh my god, awesome.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
And we drove by the Liberace Museum.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
And all I could think of was, my mom would like this.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
We didn't go there.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
The plaza's like the Liberace Plaza, and there's a big circle thing on the marquee with his head on it.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I was like, heh, that's Liberace.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
The boyfriend and I are thinking of going to Vegas, uh, before the end of the year.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
So, I, I really want to go. I haven't been in like eight years.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
He wouldn't want to go to some of these places you're talking about, but I'm sure I wouldn't want to go everywhere.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
He wants to go either, so we can maybe have a day where we do our own things.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Like, I want to see the Pinball Hall of Fame.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
And you have to eat at, um, this place that, um, that, uh, Tiara took me to called, I think it's Toto's.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
That's like a margarita brunch.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Well, you know I'm going to go visit Sauce if I'm there and all that, so.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
It's not on the strip. It's, we, we avoided the strip like a plague.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Well, I'll make Sauce take us out to all the nice places.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Anyhow, I don't want to-

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
It was, we had a very, very good time, and I got woken up by a kitten a lot.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
But it was funny because, um, you know, I'm used to, to having Dan in the bed, and I'm used to rolling over and smacking him in the face or something.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
And, you know, just rolling over and having him to, to go, oh, Dan's there, or, oh, Dan's not here.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
And instead I was rolling over and like, oh, a kitten!

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Oh, DVDs!

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
You know, so it was, it was pretty cool.

18:00.000 --> 18:10.000
But I had a great time, and, um, I, I, you know, I have to, to thank, uh, her and her family for putting up with me for the time I was there.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
I had a great time.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Excellent.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
I'm glad you had fun in Vegas.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
And now I know all the good stuff I need to go do, hopefully if I go visit before the end of the year.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
But it's just, it's just making his schedule work and my schedule work, because he's going to art school now.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
He starts art school Monday.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Really?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Believe it or not.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
Yes, he's, you're going to have to forget that whole manly man thing I was mentioning earlier.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
He's, he's studying to be an interior designer.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Cool!

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
No, I think that actually, I think that's awesome.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I would, I would love to sit down and talk with him.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm so supportive.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
I'm so supportive.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
It's, it's going to be awesome.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
I would actually love to sit down and talk with him about, about fabric for a project I'm doing.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
I, he would probably love to talk that, that shop, especially once he's had some of his classes down, so.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Cool.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Cool, cool.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
That's pretty neat.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Anyhow, enough about that.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
Let me talk about the stuff that I've been doing this week in regards to video games.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I played pretty much two video games.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
I played, I went back to play Final Fantasy IV, The After Years, because as you know, I beat the main scenario,

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
but now there's all the spinoff scenarios, so I actually beat the Rydia scenario, which wasn't as good as the main storyline,

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
which is a little disappointing because she's probably my favorite character in Final Fantasy IV.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
I know a lot of people really adore her, but her scenario felt extremely linear,

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
and I have a bad feeling that's how all the scenarios in Final Fantasy IV are going to be, all the spinoff ones,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
but I, I'm not saying that's the way it is yet because I haven't played any but the one,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
but I'm going to go try some of the others maybe a little later on this week.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
However, I guess maybe linear is not the best word because the main scenario is kind of linear too,

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
but I don't know, I just felt her story wasn't as, the story felt more linear, if that makes sense.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
Like it was a very point A to point B kind of story, whereas the main-

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Like you were playing an outline?

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
Yeah, basically, but the main story felt, there were more twists and things that made it interesting.

19:50.000 --> 19:58.000
I love, love the twist at the end of the main story because it involves introducing a new class to the game,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
which I love the idea of, and I hope one shows up in Final Fantasy XIV.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
I'm not going to spoil it. If you really want to know, go play it, but there's a new class.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
It's a combination of two existing classes.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
It has to tell me off the air because I'm poor.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
It sounds awesome. It's the character I want to be in Final Fantasy XIV if they have one.

20:15.000 --> 20:22.000
Anyway, oh, the other game, Lost Odyssey. My playing of the old school RPG made me think,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
you know what, there's not a lot of new games out right now that I want to play,

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
so I want to go back and beat some of the old games that I didn't beat before because I was too sucked into Warcraft.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
So, Lost Odyssey, old school, well not old school, but it plays like an old school Super Nintendo style RPG,

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
but it's on the 360 with awesome graphics.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I think the graphics are some of the best in any RPG I've seen, and the story, phenomenal.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
I love the story in Lost Odyssey, and just some of the little vignettes they have in the game.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
They have these little vignettes that are text stories.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
Yes, you actually sit there and read these text passages, but it isn't, you know,

20:56.000 --> 21:03.000
it has music and backgrounds, and the text like dances onto the screen in a way that kind of matches the story.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
I have no way of explaining this, that doesn't make it sound totally lame, but you just have to kind of check it out.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
It really impacts these stories that is a pretty cool way to just like read stuff.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I hated that part of the game.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
You did? I thought the stories were so good, though.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Oh, it was horrible.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh, no.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I got to read this. Skip, skip, skip.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
You have no feelings.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Skip, skip.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
No feelings. No, that's alright.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
You can skip them, though.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Once you get into a dream sequence, just hit B, and you skip the whole thing.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
They get put in an archive where you can go watch them later.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
So, yeah, I love Lost Odyssey.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
I am about caught up to where I was before, which is where I'm right at the end of the first disc,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
and I've got three more discs to go.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
So you'll probably be hearing about this game over the next month or so as I play a little more each week to try and beat it,

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
because I want to see what happens at the end of the story, because I never played that far before.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
I got sucked into raiding and, wow, or moved on to another game, because I think it came out during a busy period.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
But, yeah, Lost Odyssey.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Sadly overlooked RPG on the 360.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
I don't know why haters hated it.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
Well, I think maybe they hated it, because in some ways it's kind of linear and a little more restrictive.

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
Like, it's the more Final Fantasy X style of there's no world map, but you go to select areas,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
and the areas are their own little maps, if that makes sense.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I don't know.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
But, yeah, I still enjoy the game.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
So, yep, anyhow, that was pretty much my game of the week.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It was really just those two games.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I didn't play anything new that came out.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
No new Xbox Live arcade games or anything like that.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I don't even remember what came out this week.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Was this a big week?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
I heard now.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I heard that Madballs game is out next week.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
You know where I heard that?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
On a Facebook ad.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
So we need to go try and get those guys on the show.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
The Madballs, those were the designers we sat down with at E3, and they were showing us some clips of their game.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
It looked neat, so I'd like to have them on to talk about the game.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
So I'll have to try and get that arranged for next week or the week after.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Cool, cool.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
Actdeft in chatroom asks, will Rob finish the game or will his gamer ADD kick in the middle of the game?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Stay tuned to OLR.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
Darkcharger in chat says, those dream sequences in Lost Odyssey were one of the best things about the game.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
It's too bad none of them were actually visualized, or maybe that was a good thing.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Good point.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
I think in some ways, those stories were best left to the imagination.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
It's like reading a book. Why do you read a book so you can make up your own visualizations?

23:21.000 --> 23:29.000
But the cool thing about it was that it did things that books can't do with the text and the music and the backgrounds that you would see,

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
and the shifts in the backgrounds that did add some visual impact, but without showing you what people look like.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
It was like deep thoughts.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
In a way, it was, but you make it sound so stupid, and I'm sorry. It was awesome.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Haters gonna hate. I don't even care.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
All right.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
Before we get into some gaming news tonight and gaming discussion, we want to take care of some housekeeping,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
of which we don't have a whole lot of right now.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
No shows off in the near future or anything like that.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Still no idea what's going on for PAX, if anything.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I think both Loki and Dark Soccer are out.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
I sadly may have to skip it, too.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
I don't want to, though. I'm still going to try and make it work.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
It's just the week right after my crazy week in Reno that I have planned.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
So, yeah. Crazy, crazy.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
But I'm still hoping to do PAX. I should know in the next couple weeks.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
So I would love to see you guys at PAX if that happens.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Otherwise, we'll keep you posted here.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Join our Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
We've been getting some ads this week and really appreciate it.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
And then, of course, we have our live journal community at Orange Lounge and our Facebook group, the OL Army.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
And I would plug MySpace, too, but does anyone really use that anymore?

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
All right. That's it. Let's move into some gaming news tonight.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Loki, start us off.

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
Yes. There is a big ol' rumor, or possibly leak, I guess, of a relaunch of the Tomb Raider series.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And now I know you're thinking, hey, wait a second. Didn't that already happen?

24:53.000 --> 25:00.000
Yes, it did. But, hey, let's relaunch it again because, you know, the first relaunch didn't quite work out for them.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
So, once again, they're looking to redesign Lara Croft.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
And she does look quite a bit different.

25:07.000 --> 25:15.000
They had a picture that leaked out her holding a torch with what looks like a bow across her shoulder

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
and what maybe appears to be a sledgehammer or something, sword or something in her hand.

25:21.000 --> 25:31.000
But basically, they're saying that there's a small little, I guess, transcript of the premise of the game,

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
which they're saying that when a storm suddenly destroys her research vessel,

25:36.000 --> 25:43.000
a young and inexperienced Lara Croft finds herself stranded on a mysterious and remote island hidden off the shores of Japan.

25:43.000 --> 25:54.000
Despite several signs of various inhabitants on the island, it is oddly deserted, and an uneasy feeling settles as strange sounds emerge from the shadows.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
With only her determination, air strength, and resourcefulness to help her,

25:58.000 --> 26:08.000
Lara must overcome the challenge of harsh and unforgiving journeys that will take her across a vast island wilderness

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
and into deep, claustrophobic and menacing underground tombs.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Well, at least she's actually going to be in tombs in Tomb Raider.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
So, it's more of like a scary game, and that's what Game Guru says in chat.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
It's rumored to be survival horror, and I think that's stupid.

26:23.000 --> 26:33.000
Yes, and they're also saying, I guess, that they're possibly going to do more of an open world type of game as well.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
Now, what's interesting about this is this was supposedly to come from an Eidos mole,

26:39.000 --> 26:46.000
but it's actually been kind of revealed that it wasn't exactly from inside an Eidos,

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
but more from a kind of a survey.

26:51.000 --> 26:59.000
And, you know, you gotta love the survey leaks, but Joystiq, the blog that ran the story,

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
they actually were contacted by the Nielsen Entertainment Group to remove the image and the story.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
Now, Nielsen liked the ratings people on television, right? The Nielsen ratings?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
I guess.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Interesting.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
I mean, they have a similar name.

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
So, they were asked to remove the image and the story, and it's interesting because usually, when that happens,

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
okay, that's kind of confirming it right there.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
Just like when Namco asked us to remove some stuff, it just proved it to be true.

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
Yes. Of course, there's also some other hints that, you know, this may have been kind of in the works anyways,

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
and they pointed out four different stories they had run previously,

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
including Eidos's president said that the next Tomb Raider game will reinvigorate the franchise.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
Crystal Dynamics is hiring folks to work on an installment of a AAA franchise.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
Toby Gard, the series creator, is a leading design group for an unannounced project,

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
and Eidos is terrible at keeping its secret games under wraps.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Funny.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
But, yeah, it's probably going to happen, and I bet you anything next year, you'll have another Tomb Raider game.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
That hopefully won't suck as much as the last one.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
Tomb Raider's interesting because, like, Tomb Raider, I remember, like, Tomb Raider II and the original Tomb Raider,

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
those were really revolutionary PC games back in the day.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
But that franchise, to me anyway, I don't know, I'm sorry chatters if we have Tomb Raider fans,

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
but the franchise really kind of, it felt, like, so much more of the same, more of the same,

28:29.000 --> 28:36.000
and that whole, like, 3D platformer thing was so overdone, I think, amongst the PlayStation 2 and so forth,

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
the whole thing felt very, to me, like, you know, after a while.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
And, you know, whereas I think those original games were very revolutionary,

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
I think the later ones just bored the shit out of me, and I had no interest in playing them.

28:49.000 --> 28:55.000
So it's very interesting to me, well, A, that this is a reboot of a reboot of a reboot at this point, right?

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
And that if they're changing the genre up a little bit, that's really interesting to me as well.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
The fact that they might be going a more survival horror route, which seems to be, I guess, all the rage these days,

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
with your, you know, Saw and your Silent Hill and your Resident Evils.

29:10.000 --> 29:18.000
It's even funny, though, because when I saw the picture of Lara Croft, it reminded me of, like, someone from Resident Evil.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
I mean, the look of it looked very much like Jill or something. I don't know.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
Well, what's interesting is that they're talking about doing a movie franchise reboot, too, right?

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
Could this be playing into that at all? Could the movie franchise be going more horror-based?

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
I mean, I wouldn't think it's going to be, like, a B-movie horror, but could the movies be going more scary?

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Because, you know, there's all the talk that they're not going to have Angelina Jolie,

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
that they're going to have, you know, Megan Fox instead, is the rumor, I guess.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
But could the movies be changing genre, too?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
She's prettier.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Well, she's pretty, but she doesn't have Cambodian babies like Angelina Jolie,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
so you just can't picture her being the world traveler.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I'm just kidding. I don't...

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Yet.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
I don't care.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
No. I don't know. It's...

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
The thing, you know...

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
To me, I don't give a crap if they reboot this, because I have lost interest in this series.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
Actually, I never had interest in this series, so...

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
Great. You know, I'd like to see them try something different, but it's not going to probably get me to play it.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
But, hey.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
Well, what if the game's really good, Loki? What if you hear it's as awesome as Resident Evil 4 or something, you know?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I didn't care for Resident Evil 4 either.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
Of course, I didn't play Resident Evil 4, but I don't care for Resident Evil.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I just...

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
I don't know.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Okay, what if it plays like Grand Theft Auto 4?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
It will never play like Grand Theft Auto 4.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I'm sorry.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Alright. Tigerclaw in chat says,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Megan Fox would have to do the English accent.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Angelina Jolie does have a pretty good English accent.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
Joshi16 says, Megan Fox would have to actually do something interesting.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
XLink says, the hell with this. Where's my pressure luck game?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
You have that.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
I know, there is that DVD game.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
I got that for you.

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
I guess that shows how many people actually care about Tomb Raider, at least in our chat room, if our chat is any indication.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
I'm sorry, it was all about Tomb Raider 2, locking the butler in the freezer, and then breaking Lara Croft's neck.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
It was all about topless mod.

31:10.000 --> 31:16.000
That was really the start of that whole craze of every game on the PC has a booby mod,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
and it was Tomb Raider, the old school Tomb Raider, where you could run around as naked Lara.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
Anyhow, I guess a lot of our folks don't really seem to care about the whole Tomb Raider reboot.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
There you go.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
Chat.orangelandsradio.com if you disagree.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
Before I get into the next story, I want to mention this chat comment from earlier.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Robx327 in chat says,

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
Hey, Rob, a big game did come out this week, Battlefield 1943 on Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
See, not really my type of game, but good point.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I know there's tons of people that are really into Battlefield.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
That had a really long line at E3 as well.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I remember that.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I kept giving them away, and I never got one.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
I know.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Not that I would have played it anyway.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
It's just not my kind of game, and no disrespect to those who enjoy it.

31:59.000 --> 32:05.000
I tried to play Battlefield 1942, I think, and I was just really terrible at it.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I tried playing that on the PC.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I'm just not very good at those kind of games.

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
But yeah, I guess that is a big game this week, but certainly for one particular genre.

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
So for a roleplay gamer fan like me, not as much.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
Anyhow, let's move on to some other gaming news.

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
Speaking of roleplaying games, Dragon Quest IX is definitely highly anticipated.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
Of course, it's so highly anticipated there are folks trying to get the game before it is actually out.

32:35.000 --> 32:42.000
There's actually a leaked version of Dragon Quest IX that's showing up on some piracy sites out there.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
But guess what?

32:43.000 --> 32:55.000
If you actually download this and install it, what you're actually installing is a little hentai slideshow on your little computer, DS, called DS Owata.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
And that would be actually what you are going to install.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
And then I guess the thing, by the way, bricks your DS.

33:00.000 --> 33:08.000
Yeah, it's like you're thinking, hey, so it wasn't Dragon Quest IX, but hey, this isn't bad. It's porn.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
But then it bricks your DS and you're kind of screwed at that point.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
You probably wouldn't like that.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
There are ways to fix it though, but yeah, it's an inconvenience, I guess.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
You know, I was reading about this whole story, about the whole fake ROMs, and I thought this was very interesting.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
And certainly, we've heard this kind of thing before.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
Haven't you heard about the musicians who put the fake music out there to stop the pirates?

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
I don't think it was Madonna's last album, but the one before it.

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
She put out these tracks on the internet that would play the first 30 seconds of the song.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
And then the rest of it would be her going, what the fuck do you think you're doing?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Like, did you hear about this?

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
This is a couple years ago. It was really funny, actually.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
But it would play the first few seconds of the song.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
Which is essentially, this is like the game version of that, in a way.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
Although, now not to say that this was something that Square Enix did themselves.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
It was probably some anti-piracy people just doing that.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
But you have seen this kind of thing happen before, like the original Earthbound.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
I was doing some research on the internet, and did you know the Mother series in general had a lot of piracy protection on it?

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
That old school one on the Nintendo Entertainment System that never came over here.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
Remember how there was a fully translated one that some people bought?

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
But it had holes in it where if you would talk to certain people, it would freeze your game up completely.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
And they had to release a hack that would patch that up.

34:27.000 --> 34:34.000
Plus, the actual Earthbound that we got here, if you try to dump the ROM of that, there actually was a lot of anti-piracy things in there.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
It would check for certain things that weren't there.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Like, you tried to copy the cartridge or whatever.

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
You would get all the way to the last boss, it would freeze, and then you would lose all of your data.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It would erase your game. How mean is that?

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
Not just that, but on your way there, you would have to fight three times as many monsters the entire game.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
The number of random monsters went up like crazy.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
So it was very interesting to see.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
But that wasn't really a fake ROM.

34:58.000 --> 35:05.000
That was a case of where the cartridge was looking for certain things that only a legitimate cartridge would have.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
I know one thing, the English version of the cart would look to see if it was being played on a PAL Super Nintendo.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Because if it was, it would lock you out and you wouldn't be able to play.

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000
It would do those types of things to prevent the whole dumping and copying of games.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
It's interesting we haven't seen more games do that.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
And maybe it's harder to do with the whole CD-based system, I don't know.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
But kind of interesting.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
So, I don't know.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
What do you think, Loki?

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Do you think game companies might be doing this on purpose?

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
Do you think there's any chance that all Square Enix could be behind something like this?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Do you think they should be?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
I think it's stupid.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
Because it's not going to really stop anything.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Because really a lot of people will download it and then they'll post,

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
Hey, by the way, this is not the game. This is actually a hacked thing.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
It's really going to affect just a small group of people.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
And they found a fix for it.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
So, it really accomplished nothing.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
And a lot of times there will be...

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
We've talked about them before, different anti-piracy stuff that they have.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Especially in DS games.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
It tricks people for a while and it stops them from being able to play it.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
But then eventually they fix it and patch it.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
And it's done.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
So they found a way to un-brick all those DS's already?

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
I was looking up something.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Because I was actually looking at...

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I didn't really want to pirate the game.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Because I don't really...

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It's a full Japanese game and it's RPG.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It's just like...

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I don't have time to play it for one.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And two, it's all in Japanese. I wouldn't know what the hell is going on.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
So, it's just not interesting.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
I was kind of curious to see if they did find a fix for that stuff.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
And there was someone talking about ways to fix it.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
And there was apparently a way to fix it if you'd done something else.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
I don't remember what it was.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
But yeah, apparently there are ways to fix it if you did brick it.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Interesting.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
And Frisbee in chat says,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
You can't just break someone's DS.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Well, that's what they're saying, that they break these things somehow.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
I don't know how you do it, but it must do something.

37:05.000 --> 37:12.000
It overwrote something that was on their actual firmware.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
So it just kind of tweaked something.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Interesting.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Well, I don't know. Is it what these pirates deserve?

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
Do you think it's what people deserve for being so over-eager or careless?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Well, there's people...

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
Like right now, they've already got patches in the place for...

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Because the actual ROM did leak out already.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Obviously, because it was going to.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
But they already have hacks for it to translate the menus.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
And they've got walkthroughs that people have done translating everything else.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Topless mod?

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
No topless mod yet, but they've hacked it so that you can max out your experience and that kind of stuff.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
So, I mean, it's just only a matter of time.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Everything's just a matter of time.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
There's nothing that's unhackable.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
They will find a way around everything.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
I don't know. I'm borderline interested in Dragon Quest IX.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
If you've listened to this show before, you know I have this weird thing about handheld gaming.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
It's going to come out over here eventually.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
I know it's going to come out over here, but I don't know if I really want it because of the factors on the DS.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
And you know how I feel about handheld gaming.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
But then again, I did play Final Fantasy IV.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
I've played Final Fantasy II and I on PSP.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
I'll probably get this, but I'm going to wait and see the reviews first.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
I'm kind of actually glad it's out in Japan for a little while before it comes out here.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
That way I kind of hear if it's good or not.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
I really liked Dragon Quest VIII, though, on PlayStation 2.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
That was a pretty good RPG.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
That's another one I need to go back and finish, along with Final Fantasy XII.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
But I have to go get my PlayStation 2 and hook it up because my 3 is not backwards compatible.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Pfft. Lame.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Mine is.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Well, lucky you.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
What about Dragon Quest swords on the Wii?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I'm not interested in the spin-offs, really.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Wasn't that a little cheesy, like for kids or something?

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
So is the person that's playing all of the Final Fantasy IV spin-offs.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Yeah, whatever.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
But Final Fantasy IV is not like a kids thing. It's just old-school graphics.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
You know, what was it? The Mystic Quest?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
It's what I remember as a kid.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Oh, hell no, it's not Mystic Quest.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
It's like Final Fantasy IV hard-type.

39:06.000 --> 39:13.000
You know, the original Japanese one where you get random battles way more often than you did in the American release.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
And so forth.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
So I'm probably going to finish Final Fantasy IV, the after years.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
But for right now, I wanted to go to something a little more new school.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
And I remembered I really wanted to beat Lost Odyssey.

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
And for some weird reason, I actually do kind of want to play Blue Dragon, even though that wasn't nearly as good.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I just kind of want to finish that, so who knows.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Anyhow.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
VxjasonXV in chat is frowning, saying,

39:36.000 --> 39:41.000
I liked Mystic Quest. I beat Mystic Quest, actually. I did play that all the way through.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Yeah, it was not like it was a very hard game to beat.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
Yeah, it wasn't terrible. It just wasn't Final Fantasy at all.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
It really wasn't originally a Final Fantasy game, anyway.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
No, it wasn't. It was sure as hell was.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
In fact, do you know in Japan, that game was released as Final Fantasy USA?

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
Boy, didn't that make us look stupid.

39:57.000 --> 40:06.000
But now, keep in mind, though, whenever games released in America, they get re-released in Japan as international versions.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
Because typically, especially with the Square games, we start getting extra stuff.

40:10.000 --> 40:17.000
Like, for example, Final Fantasy VII, if I'm right, it got a re-release.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
10 did, I know for sure. I think 7.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Because we got another weapon.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Yeah, there was little things here and there, I think.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
And they took out the test zero.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
I want to say 12 had one, too. I don't remember.

40:31.000 --> 40:38.000
But with 7, you could still find a bunch of the test bugs in the Japanese version.

40:38.000 --> 40:47.000
Like the test zero, or one of the other events, like the Aerith sequel thing that they were supposed to have taken out.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
But, hey, Shermy.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I was trying to get Shermy to talk on air, but Shermy's shy.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
But, yeah, when that version came out.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Just pat her on the butt, she'll start meowing.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
No, she went to her hiding place.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
No, you have to pat her, like, right on the back, over her tail.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Oh, she's going to her h-

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
By the way, Shermy's little bed, or hiding place, is, there's this little, like, where the OLR studio computer is.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
There's a little box right next to it.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
I'll tell you what's in the box, too.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
What's in the box?

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
A sheep skin rug, a sheep fur rug.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Well, at least it's not a severed head.

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
So, but it's, like, right in the corner, under the computer table, so it's really in a dark little corner.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
And Shermy has made this, like, her little bed.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
I think it's very cute.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah, it's definitely covered with Shermy hair.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Yeah.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
But, well, when we had, it actually, part of it got ruined because of her to start with.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
But, I also spilled Kool-Aid on it.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to get away from video gaming with kitty talk, but, yeah, let's move on with some more gaming news.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
Dark Sakura, if you want to go ahead and get into the next thing for us.

41:49.000 --> 41:56.000
By the way, if you want to join us in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com is the place to be live on this Sunday evening as we tape on All Games Radio.

41:56.000 --> 42:09.000
Well, there was talk about Sony getting the Netflix service, and it's coming to the, the Bravia TV.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
To the PlayStation Bravia.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
To the Bravia internet capable TVs.

42:14.000 --> 42:20.000
There's actually nothing mentioned about it coming to the PS3.

42:20.000 --> 42:25.000
There's hints of it coming to the Wii, but nothing yet.

42:25.000 --> 42:42.000
But, yeah, Sony is actually saying right off the bat that they were going to look into content for the PlayStation Network, but they don't have anything regarding the Netflix to announce at this time.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
So, in other words, not bloody likely.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
Do you think that maybe Microsoft has some type of agreement where maybe this can't come to the PlayStation 3?

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
Well, then again, they've always talked about it for the Wii, haven't they?

42:54.000 --> 43:00.000
And there's surveys going out, so if Microsoft had some type of exclusive agreement, maybe that can't happen. I don't know.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
But, very interesting.

43:02.000 --> 43:11.000
I don't think, yeah, they probably just, Sony might actually not want it on their platform because they have their service on there and they don't want to compete with their service.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Because they're greedy little bastards.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
It's not like Netflix, I mean let's be honest, the Netflix streaming content still leaves a lot to be desired.

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
You are looking at the back catalog of movies that most people miss the first time.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
They do have a few decent movies on there now that they have the Stars Play especially.

43:29.000 --> 43:36.000
They do get some stuff that's recently like to cable movies, but that's about as recent as you get with a lot of this stuff.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
And now they have some of the Disney movies too, I will say, which is pretty cool.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
But, there's still a lot of room for improvement.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
I would say the thing I like Netflix for best is the TV shows.

43:46.000 --> 43:51.000
They do have a lot of like the NBC shows and stuff on demand type stuff.

43:51.000 --> 43:57.000
And you can get that, but you know, there's still a lot.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
I guess Sony has the TV service too though.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Maybe that's the competition, I don't know.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
But Xbox has their on demand stuff too.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
Maybe they just want people to buy their stupid HDTVs.

44:09.000 --> 44:16.000
And the best thing about this though is it's certain HDTVs and you have to have it hooked up a certain way.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
And it's just like a really small percentage of people actually going to be using this.

44:21.000 --> 44:29.000
I don't know. It's neat I guess, but you know, until it's actually supported on all their TVs.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
Let me get you some chat comments from chat.orangelauntrader.com. Tigerclaw asks,

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
Here's the thing, are those Bravia TVs come equipped with built-in Wi-Fi?

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
I'm guessing they must if they have the Netflix service in them.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
That's kind of the thing to do with a lot of appliances now.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
Like tons of things are coming out with Wi-Fi enabled.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
They have little radios now that are like internet radios basically that use Wi-Fi.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
They hook right into Wi-Fi.

44:54.000 --> 45:01.000
It's getting I guess so cheap, the technology, that you're starting to see it in a lot of stuff.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
It's pretty soon my toaster's going to have Wi-Fi.

45:03.000 --> 45:09.000
And it'll, yeah, Dark Soccer's yelling from the kitchen, you can put Linux on a toaster.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
You can, but also just have the toaster connected to Wi-Fi where it goes,

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
Ding! The toast is done. Or maybe it'll pop a message on all your computers.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Toast is done.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Why would you leave your toast to toast?

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
I have a comment on this.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Alright, Dark Soccer wants to make a comment on this.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
They do have a stove that has a refrigerator mode in it.

45:28.000 --> 45:34.000
And downloads recipes so that you can cook by recipe from the internet.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
So it does hook up Wi-Fi and wired.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Wow.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Yeah.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Interesting.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
So yeah, the fridges have Wi-Fi in them to look up recipes and things like that.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
A lot of devices have Wi-Fi in them.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
So I would not be surprised at all if the TV has Wi-Fi somehow built in it.

45:51.000 --> 45:59.000
Tigerclaw goes on to say some Blu-ray players have built in Wi-Fi but cost more as opposed to the ones built with LAN.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
And that's true because, you know, to get your Blu-ray firmware updates, you have to be connected to the internet somehow, right?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Yeah.

46:06.000 --> 46:13.000
Dark Charger in chat says, seems funny that even standalone Blu-ray players offer it from Samsung and LG.

46:13.000 --> 46:19.000
I've heard about that too, the whole Blu-ray slash Netflix players. I've heard about that.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
Deathwishing is asking for less movie news, more gaming.

46:23.000 --> 46:29.000
Well, I guess you could tie this into gaming somehow because let's face it, those gaming consoles, the 360 and Playstation 3,

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
the movies are a big part of the business and kind of how they're getting into more and more homes, right?

46:35.000 --> 46:43.000
Because maybe mom and dad and grandma aren't so interested in playing Tomb Raider on it, but they'd be more interested in downloading movies.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Watching Tomb Raider on it.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Possibly.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
No, probably not.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
What was the other comment we had in here?

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
If you want to add your comments, chat.orangecharger.com.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
Dark Charger also says, seems funny that even standalone Blu-ray players...

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Oh, I'm sorry, I read that one already. Where was the one?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Ah, sorry.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
Dark Charger said, my guess is Sony doesn't want it because it competes with their own service in their eyes.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
Well, I guess we'll see what develops.

47:14.000 --> 47:23.000
I think it's inevitable it'll get something streaming more, you know, along the Netflix model at some point,

47:23.000 --> 47:28.000
but maybe because Sony owns its own movie studio wants to do something different. We'll see.

47:28.000 --> 47:38.000
Yeah. Well, Harmonix basically thinks, you know, this is according to Josh Randall, their boss,

47:38.000 --> 47:47.000
he thinks that the music game genre could actually leave the consoles and actually go to more of their own standalone peripherals,

47:47.000 --> 47:53.000
basically the plug-and-play type game things, and I know we've already kind of seen this with some things.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
I know they're not very good, but...

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
That was my first reaction, too. Did you know that we have Strawberry Shortcake DDR?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Yes, I did.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
It's plug-and-play?

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Yeah, it's horrible.

48:04.000 --> 48:10.000
Yeah, they're not that fun. Or wasn't there that one dance, like, I don't remember, maybe it was a DVD,

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
but there was some type of dance game that just came with a mat.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
It was DDR.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
Yeah, it was the DDR brand. It came with a mat, but it didn't do anything. The mat didn't do a damn thing.

48:20.000 --> 48:27.000
It was just something, it was obviously made for three-year-olds, just for them to jump on the mat pretending they're actually doing something,

48:27.000 --> 48:33.000
but it would just play these cheesy flash music videos on the TV. This is the kind of shit three and four-year-olds love, though.

48:33.000 --> 48:40.000
So I forgive them for that, even if they did slap the DDR label on it, fine, whatever, it's not like they tried to market it to a serious audience.

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
But, you know, we've seen this kind of plug-and-play stuff before, even, yeah, like you said, the Strawberry Shortcake DDR,

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
and some of these other DDRs. Isn't there a Disney DDR that's plug-and-play, too?

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Yeah.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
Yeah. And, you know, I'm sure there's stuff besides just DDR. Well, there's DDR knock-offs, that's for sure.

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
And I, it wasn't, isn't there a guitar thing out there that's plug-and-play?

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Yes.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Maybe I'm crazy.

49:01.000 --> 49:10.000
There is. Jackspecific, they have the G2 Game Girl Hannah Montana guitar video game, which you will play.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Is Footy Monster listening, Footy?

49:12.000 --> 49:21.000
You can play guitar, and they even have a trailer video for it on Amazon, and I actually did watch this earlier this week just to see what the hell this was,

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
because I knew it was crap, and I really had low expectations for it.

49:25.000 --> 49:39.000
But you know what, hey, for the non, I don't know, experienced freak teen girl that doesn't give a crap, you know, for $30, you know, $33.27,

49:39.000 --> 49:47.000
you can get this guitar, you know, that plug-and-plays into your TV, and you can actually play with Hannah Montana songs, I guess.

49:47.000 --> 50:01.000
I don't know. But, I mean, until the technology becomes cheap enough to where they can really, you know, pack a lot of oomph inside of, you know, a little plastic controller,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I don't think this is really going to take off.

50:03.000 --> 50:11.000
Well, what if, though, now, I'm sure this guy who made the comment has to be aware this type of thing has already been attempted,

50:11.000 --> 50:19.000
but we've never seen anything on a large scale level. This kind of ties in, in a way, to the fact that, like, Wi-Fi is in all of our devices now.

50:19.000 --> 50:28.000
I mean, I don't think you would see something like this get released for $30, but don't you think, for the cost of $150, maybe $200, which some of these games are getting up to,

50:28.000 --> 50:35.000
they could build something that's essentially, it's not that it's console-less gaming, it's that the console is built into the controllers.

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
It's built into the drum kit. And I don't think you'd see anything on the level of the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3,

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
but I think you'd have something where, you know, it would get the job done.

50:44.000 --> 50:56.000
You could probably get, relatively cheap, at least PlayStation 1 level hardware in one of these things really cheap, maybe even PlayStation 2 level hardware in one of these things really cheap,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
where you could even go on and download songs.

50:59.000 --> 51:08.000
I'm thinking this guy's talking about not so much the, this crap that they make for six-year-olds to, you know, to easily amuse them for a while so you don't have to listen to the wine,

51:08.000 --> 51:14.000
but something that, you know, the more adult gamers can take seriously, and more importantly, download songs onto.

51:14.000 --> 51:22.000
That's gonna be the big thing about these. They probably, if you bypass Xbox Live Marketplace, you bypass Sony's thing and Nintendo's thing,

51:22.000 --> 51:29.000
what is one big thing this is really about? Cutting out the middleman. Making more money from the download songs.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
I don't think it'll take off. It really, I don't think it's gonna work.

51:32.000 --> 51:40.000
It's just because they are limited to what they can do with the hardware right now, and honestly, I think if it could be done, it would be done.

51:40.000 --> 51:48.000
Because, I mean, obviously everyone wants to make money, and they're always trying to come up with these knock-off games.

51:48.000 --> 51:55.000
If anything, I could see them doing something, you know, and I'm surprised Konami hasn't done this yet,

51:55.000 --> 52:02.000
because they did this with, you know, some of their Frogger and Yu-Gi-Oh games where they have these things that you basically buy.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
It's a USB thumb drive. You plug it into your computer, connects you to the internet, and you play a game.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I have one of those. It's Frogger, yeah.

52:08.000 --> 52:14.000
Yes. So you get something like this that's either DDR or something like that. You plug the mat into your PC. Boom.

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
You're playing DDR. Or you plug in the guitar into your PC and you're playing Guitar Freaks or Rock Revolution.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
Hopefully not Rock Revolution, but actually Guitar Freaks.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
They have tons of this stuff for the TV, too. This is huge. And actually, even some hardcore gamers like this stuff,

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
because you have a lot of those classic video games inside the joystick.

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
Yeah, the flashback systems are awesome. The flashback systems are actually, you know, Atari 2600s.

52:36.000 --> 52:44.000
Well, not just those. I'm talking about like the little joysticks that have like Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and, you know, Baby Pac-Man or whatever.

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
Not Baby Pac-Man. Super Pac-Man. Like, all in. Shut up. Dark Soccer is yelling in the kitchen.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
I'd like to see him try to put Baby Pac-Man. But, like, you know what I'm talking about. Like, all those little things in the joystick.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
That's a big market, too.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Yeah.

52:57.000 --> 53:04.000
So, it's not surprising. What I'm saying is that all that crap is cheap. Atari 2600 is cheap.

53:04.000 --> 53:10.000
This would really be about taking it to the next level. Because if you can get people to pay $150 for these instruments as it is,

53:10.000 --> 53:18.000
why not get them to pay $20 more to bypass the console? And then, you know, even if the developers have to take a hit on the cost of that,

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
they'd make the money back on download content.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Yeah.

53:23.000 --> 53:30.000
I don't know, guys. In chat, would you guys be interested? Let's say they could build something like this that would be at a PlayStation 2 level.

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
Let's say that you could basically get Rock Band on a PlayStation 2 without needing the PlayStation 2.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Or even, let's think, even beyond this.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Would you be interested in this?

53:38.000 --> 53:46.000
Like, through, like, say, a cable provider like Comcast or something like that, you're, you know, plugging your controller into the actual, you know,

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
cable box and you go on their on-demand service and you're downloading songs or something like that.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
Or, hell, you could even have it where you stream songs, you know, and play, you know, that way.

53:56.000 --> 54:02.000
I mean, there's a whole lot of, you know, things they could really do with it. But I still don't think it's going to take off.

54:02.000 --> 54:08.000
You know, and funny enough, I know I've talked about this on the show before, but back in the day, way back in the day,

54:08.000 --> 54:15.000
my cable provider, this is, I'm talking the mid-80s, okay, my cable provider actually had an on-demand video game service.

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
You would buy these tokens that would cost, like, 10 bucks or whatever, and for, like, 25 cents each,

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
basically you would use your, like, $10 balance or whatever, for 25 cents each, you could play these little video games

54:25.000 --> 54:31.000
that were, like, on an Atari 5200 kind of graphics level that you would play through the cable.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
And I don't know if the box just happened to double as a video gaming system or what that was,

54:35.000 --> 54:40.000
but it's fascinating to me you haven't seen cable providers do that in a long time.

54:40.000 --> 54:47.000
The mid-80s, folks, a lot of you guys weren't even born yet. There were video games, like, on demand through the box.

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
Yeah, you had that too. But Sega Channel really didn't take off, you know what I mean?

54:51.000 --> 54:59.000
But you could do this stuff. I'm kind of surprised that cable has not tried to get back into this,

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
especially with Comcast, especially, you know, I know them because they're the local provider here,

55:03.000 --> 55:09.000
getting into DVR and movies on demand and telephones now.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
Yeah.

55:12.000 --> 55:19.000
And Jason says, totally not worth the investment. I remember liking the thing as a kid. I don't know.

55:19.000 --> 55:24.000
Jason says there's no other way to do it. Not yet, anyway.

55:24.000 --> 55:31.000
I don't know. It's just, I understand, you know, you can buy, like, these peripherals and stuff now,

55:31.000 --> 55:37.000
and they are expensive, but, you know, at least you can use them for a few games and get some use out of them.

55:37.000 --> 55:45.000
I don't know, and the flashback systems are good for what they are. I mean, it's some old, you know,

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
Atari 2600 games. You can hack them, though, so you can actually plug in your own cartridges.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Cheap thrills. That's what they are, cheap thrills.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
Exactly. It's what you give your kids to play.

55:54.000 --> 56:01.000
Alright, well, we'll see what happens with the music games in the future. I think it'll happen.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
I think it'll happen, and I think it'll happen by Christmas. Maybe not this year, but they better hurry up

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
and do it, though, before the music, because, you know, Guitar Hero is forcing the music game series

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
to jump the shark, so it'll be interesting to see what happens.

56:16.000 --> 56:24.000
Rumor is going around the internet this week that possibly we have a Kane and Lynch fiasco part 2.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
Remember this? This is a whole fiasco.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
I think it'll be part 3.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Is it part 3?

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
It did Tomb Raider. The last Tomb Raider game did the same thing.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
Well, look, let's catch people up if you forgot. There was this whole fiasco at GameSpot where it was rumored,

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
it was never really proved one way or the other, that Eidos was buying off GameSpot to give Kane and Lynch

56:42.000 --> 56:47.000
essentially decent reviews, and I remember it kind of resulted, wasn't that the reason why some people,

56:47.000 --> 56:54.000
the one guy got fired was because his review for the game was bad and the company had paid a lot of money

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
or whatever, so they put a lot of heat on to fire the guy, but then everybody in the situation denied it.

56:59.000 --> 57:05.000
Everybody in the scenario denied it, but it was one of those things where, gee, it all just looks too coincidental,

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
I think was what happened.

57:06.000 --> 57:12.000
Well, the rumor is that Eidos could once again be messing around with review scores.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
There's a nasty little story going around the blogs this week saying that

57:15.000 --> 57:22.000
Eidos has an embargo on the review copies of Arkham Asylum, the Batman Arkham Asylum game,

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
and basically you cannot release your reviews until the end of the month,

57:26.000 --> 57:32.000
but if you put the game on the cover of your magazine and have a review score with 90% or above,

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
then you can break the embargo early.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
That's the rumor going around, and I'm sure a lot of us are looking at that going,

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
man, that's just shady.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
And then there's others of us, including myself, that's sitting around going,

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
I can't wait to see what magazines have Batman Arkham Asylum on the cover next month

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
because those are the magazines you can no longer trust.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
And these are basically, this isn't the first time this has happened.

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
Back in November 2008, Eidos basically was putting the same type of pressure on publishers

58:00.000 --> 58:06.000
saying that if you're planning on reviewing Tomb Raider Underworld at less than an 8.0,

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Eidos will need you to hold your review until Monday.

58:09.000 --> 58:14.000
But if you're going to put it out now, you can put it out at a higher review.

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
It was like, seriously, you're going to attempt to do that?

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
In their defense, I understand why they're doing that because obviously they want the positive buzz going into it.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Not that I'm going to say Batman Arkham Asylum is going to be a horrible game

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
because it's not, it looks good.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
But, you know, that's why they're doing that.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
But it's still crappy.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
It looks good, but after playing it at E3, my worry is it's going to be very repetitive.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
But of course, I find those types of fighting games to get very repetitive very quickly.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
I think it's going to be more of a rental.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
But again, I'm completely judging things off a 15 minute demo I played at E3.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
Do not take that as my final review of the game.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
But I am a little nervous.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
But I am a huge Batman fan, so, you know.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
But I just want to clarify now.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
Now that we've kind of said that, I do want to state this, because this is important,

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
is that Kotaku ran an update to their version of the story.

59:04.000 --> 59:09.000
Eidos apparently contacted them, extremely denying the story, saying, quote,

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
With regards, an article posted on Ram Raider, which was the original site.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Which, by the way, Ram Raider?

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
I mean, I understand what they're, like, you know, Ram that you have on a computer.

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
But I don't want to, I don't want to make enemies, but Ram Raider? Really?

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
That's just begging to be made fun of. I'm sorry.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
That's just a blog. It's literally like a blog run at blogspot.com.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Seems like the name of the bad porn.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
I know, I know. But anyway, sorry.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I hope nobody from that site listens to the show.

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
I don't mean to make fun, but look at all the attention and extra views you're getting this week.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Anyway, Eidos said,

59:40.000 --> 59:47.000
With regards to the article posted on Ram Raider alleging that Eidos has fixed review scores for Batman Arkham Asylum,

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
we want to state that no discussions have been held about review scores with any magazines.

59:51.000 --> 59:57.000
In short, there is simply not one shred of truth in this article except for the title of the game.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And that is from John Brooke, the head of UK marketing for Eidos.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
So they deny it, saying this is not true.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:11.000
And what, you know, to be fair to them, what a good lie that would be to say that any magazine that puts it on the cover

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and has a review score of 90% or above is kind of breaking the rules a little bit.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
But it'll be interesting to see.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I think one way you could prove this story true is what sites have their reviews up by a certain day.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Are they all good news? You know what I mean?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Like you could see if this is true or not based on what comes out.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And also if they're coming out and saying, oh, this is the exclusive review of this.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I hate exclusive reviews of anything because that's retarded.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
This is my exclusive impression of this game.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Yes, it is.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Your early review. That's what it is. Your early review.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Well, I know what's going to happen is it's going to leak out because it's Eidos.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And because it's a game that they're probably going to ship early.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
So it's going to leak out to the internet and everyone will know if it's crap or not.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And it will be already out there.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And they're going to have a bunch of independent blog sites and stuff giving their reviews, breaking all the other embargos.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
So it doesn't matter. You're not going to get what you want anyway.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
So too bad.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
This is how the things work.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Which is a darn shame because if Batman is a good game, even this rumor sadly puts a little blemish on it.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And to be honest, not one that's actually that important.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I mean, even amongst all the hardcore gamers, the people that listen to these shows and read the blogs.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I think the audience for Batman Arkham Asylum is way bigger.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
You know, when you consider there's lots of Batman fans out there.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
The people that saw The Dark Knight, which is, you know, just a huge, grossing movie and everything.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I think there's a big casual gaming audience for this.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And by casual gaming, I mean the college kids who thinks video games are cool but don't obsess about them like the rest of us do.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
If that makes sense.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I don't think they'd give a shit one way or the other about the ratings.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Without a doubt, I think it's going to be a big game.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I think it would be too.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.000
You know, coming out in August, there's really only Madden, this, and Wolfenstein, and maybe Section 8.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Those are the big games for August.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And, you know, I mean, I think this is probably going to be better than Wolfenstein.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
So, I'd say it's like at least the second, you know, top two of the month.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Live on this Sunday evening, July the 12th.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Dark Charger says, let's not forget that it could also go the other way around.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Hey, we'll give you a good review.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Can we please break this embargo?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Interesting perspective.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Could it be that sometimes the offering party is not the game company, but the over-eager site that wants to get the first jump on the review?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
All it's about is its hits and subscriptions is really what it comes down to.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Because, you know, if they have the review early, then, you know, everybody picks up.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Oh, hey, you know, such and such site or magazine has a review early.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
They put a link to it.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Everybody goes and visits it or, you know, looks at the magazine to see what the impressions are on it.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And, you know, that's it.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And then, you know, if it's the other way around, hey, you know, we'll give you a good review if you let us break the embargo.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I have a problem with that anyways because, you know, once again, there are certain websites, IGN, that like to have exclusive reviews about games and stuff like that just to get more page hits.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And that's all they really care about is just hits to their site.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And I'm sure that they make a lot of, you know, negotiations with these people.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Hell, we've seen it firsthand, negotiations about breaking embargoes and stuff.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It's just a tool to, you know, make these sites feel special and to get more hits.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Bobby in chat says, true story, I was doing a review of a certain game series and was allowed to somewhat break the embargo.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
The embargo was midnight on Monday morning and my show is on Sunday night if I like the game.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But they wouldn't let me break the embargo if I didn't like it.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Dude, I'm telling you guys, I've been saying it for seven goddamn years, independent is the only people you can trust.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Believe it.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You know, I kind of hope the game leaks out early because I want to review it and break any embargo that they have.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
But what if, wait a minute, you can't, you know, you can't get on here and say it's bad just because of this.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
No.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
You have to be fair.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Either way it goes.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
You know, I'd be honest, I'm always honest about my games.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Why would I, it's not going to help anybody if I lie about, you know, whether a game's good or not.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I don't, honestly, I don't care enough because Eidos isn't doing anything for me.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They aren't giving me anything for free.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
They aren't, you know, treating me special.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
What do I care?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
You know, I don't care either way.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So, big deal.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
If their game sucks, their game sucks.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
If it's good, good for them because they haven't had a lot of games that didn't suck.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
So, yeah.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Mini Ninjas looks good though.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I'll give them that.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
But, yeah.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Alright, well, we'll move on.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000
In the meantime, we'll continue to be as honest as possible in our reviews of games.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So, we have something called Integrity.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yes.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
So, anyway, let's move on.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
We've got some more gaming news to talk about tonight.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Release date's coming up as well as a quick break before too long.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Well, we are seeing something that's a little kind of old coming out in an old way.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
But it's new.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
But it's old.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It's old, but it's new, but it's old.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Okay.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
It's a new item done in an old way of an old franchise.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Tell us what the hell it is already.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Mega Man.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Cool.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
We have Mega Man demo released for the Atari 2600.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
What?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Yeah.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
It was done for the I Am 8-Bit show.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
And it's actually on Atari's Atari Ages forum now.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So you can go download and play it on your emulator.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And by the way, if you want to hear some of the sweet Atari 2600 music, here you go.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
See if you recognize what stage this is.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
That's right.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
It's Elec Man.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
There you go.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And this demo, by the way, is insanely short.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
It's like three screens.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
They play these three screens and then they go up to where the boss is and then fight the boss.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And the poor little guy dies on the boss, but...

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
The physics are very well done.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yeah.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Oh, sorry.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
It looks like four screens.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
So if you count Elec Man's screen, it's like a fifth screen.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
With the same little mini monsters, the little dudes that are on the ground crawling back and forth.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Yeah.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
But still, I mean, neat concept, right?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Yeah.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
But they're moving right.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
And then horrible flicker when the guy gets to Elec Man.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
But, hey, you know, there's only so much you can do with the hardware.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Yeah, there's some games you can make flicker work for you.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I guess that's true.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
But, yeah, you know, it's interesting.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
It's neat.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And I think it's more of a novel thing from, oh, that's, you know, oh, it's Atari 2600, ooh.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
You know, that kind of thing.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
But this does beg the question, why?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Because it can.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
It's a labor of love.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I guess that's the only way you can justify it because, I mean, really?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000
It's something that you'll download and you'll play for five minutes and you'll go, oh, that's kind of cool.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And tell your friend, oh, ha, ha, ha, look at this.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
And then you're done.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000
But the sad thing is it probably took the guy five days to put it all together, you know, or even longer maybe.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Maybe, maybe.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
You can make a whole Metroid game in a day with the Metroid level editor.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And, you know, with the Atari games, you just have to know your basic programming and they're done.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
You can probably do that in a day.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Jason in our chat room, VXJXV says, they do what they want, or I'm sorry, they do what they must because they can.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Get it? Forget it.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I, no, I get it.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And honestly, actually, I think that that's about the most accurate way to describe it.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
He can do it?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Fine, do it.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Free country, your server space.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
All right.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Well, we're going to do what we must because we can right now with some release dates.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Loki, take it away with the US releases.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Not much coming out this week, unfortunately.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Got a couple greatest hits games, Transformers on the PSP, now greatest hits.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I'm surprised it took this long.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
And Call of Duty Road to Victory is now greatest hits as well.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Both of those can be found for 20 bucks on the PSP.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Brand new stuff, Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the Mummy on the DS.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Also coming out on PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PSP.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
NCAA Football 2010 is your big game for the week.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Ripping off on the Cookie Moa franchise, Science Papa coming out on the Wii and DS this week.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Was that from the same company?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
No.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Oh, funny.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
From Activision.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Tony Hawk Project 8 also hitting greatest hits on PSP.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Lot of PSP greatest hits this week.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And also Marvel Ultimate Alliance also greatest hits on PSP.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And then the last game this week, Birthday Party Bash, it's basically a birthday party

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
in a box with coloring sheets and fun stuff like that.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Oh, yay.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000
A generic party game and that's available on the Wii from Take-Two.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
That's it.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
It's a slow week.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Oh, and a whole ton of controller skins for all your favorite college football teams available

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
on Xbox 360 and PS3.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Alright, well, moving on to Japanese release dates.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Nothing on Xbox 360 this week, but there is a game on PlayStation 3.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Professional Baseball Spirits version 6 is out this week from Konami in Japan and this

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
is like a very realistic type of baseball game because you know baseball is pretty popular

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
over in Japan and very realistic looking game.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
It's a pretty cool looking baseball game with all the Japanese teams and such, I'm sure.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I don't know if it's an officially licensed thing or what.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I'm not that familiar with the series, but the graphics look pretty good from the screenshots

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I can see.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
That's really the only big release on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Going to the Nintendo Wii, the only game that's out on there is Nihon Yaku Kiku Shonen Batting

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Revolution.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Yes, that's right.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Another baseball game, but this one's on the Wii and it is not the same type of game.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
It's not from Konami either.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
It's from a company called Alpha Unit.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
That's really it on the consoles this week.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Looking at the handhelds real quick.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
By the way, that baseball game is also being ported to PlayStation 2 if you haven't upgraded

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
for whatever reason.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
But if you are on the DS, you get some Disney games this week.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Bolt is coming out as well as Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Although, to be fair, that's EA, not Disney.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Those are out on the Nintendo DS this week.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I'm sure those are just translations of the American versions of those games.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Awatama is another game out this week on the Nintendo DS.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And quickly going to the PSP.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
There really isn't a whole lot out unless you are a fan of Ys.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Yay!

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Ys I and II Chronicles is the big game this week on the PSP.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
So check that out.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I have that on the PC Engine.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
That's really it as far as release dates go this week.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
By the way, though, I do want to quickly say one thing I noticed that's being marketed here

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
on this site where I get the Japanese release dates from.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
This new Korean thing called the Wiz.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Have you heard of this, Loki?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It's like a little handheld device that looks like, I guess you could say like a Game Boy Advance

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
is what it looks like.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000
But what it is, it's actually a little mini computer that is like, it's 533 megahertz with a 3D accelerator

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
open source platform Linux operating system on it.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And it's this tiny little thing.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Yeah, they've got a few of those.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Hell, they were showing off some of those at like the last, not last E3, but the last E3 went before that.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Maybe this has been out a while and I'm just now noticing it because it's on sale or something.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
But it just looks neat.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
It does video and everything.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
They have a bunch of them, yeah.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
They're out there.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
A lot of open source platforms.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I think the other one was like GPX2 or something like that.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I don't know what it's called.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Looks like a direct competitor to the PSP in a way.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Yeah, and it's all open source and there are some pretty cool stuff you can get.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I think you can get like Beats of Rage and stuff like that for it.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Cool.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Well, I've only got one thing for our UK releases.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
What's that?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
On the 17th, Bionic Commando for PC.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
That's a very slow week for releases, isn't it?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Yeah.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
All across the board.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Yep.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Alright, well I guess things will probably pick up, you know, especially as we get into September, October is when we're going to start seeing the holiday games come out.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
So, we deal with this lull and then we're going to be overwhelmed with stuff.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Let's get back into a couple more gaming stories and our classic game of the week.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Loki.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Yes.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000
So, this is kind of interesting since we were talking about game releases and everything.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
There are two big games, of course, coming out this fall from Activision and EA.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It's Our Hero 5 and the Beatles Rock Band.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And, you know, those games are definitely going to be very hot sellers on all platforms.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Well, the thing is, this is also kind of a test for Activision and EA.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000
You see, this is the first game, or the first two games that are being released on the Wii that are going to be a $60 price point.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And now, these are not only, you know, these are not a bundle of any sort.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
This is just a game by itself.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
The game software is $60.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And, you may think, well that's not a big deal because, you know, the Xbox 360, we've been paying those prices since launch.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:42.000
But, I have a feeling this may be a start of another new trend where, I don't know if you remember with like Xbox Live Arcade and stuff like that.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000
You know, top price at one point was, you know, $10 or 800 Microsoft points.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Then, there was one game out there that decided, hey, you know what, let's try, you know, charge 1200 Microsoft points.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Was it Luminous, the first one that went to $15?

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It was Luminous or maybe, I'm not sure what the other one might have been.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
But, Luminous was a good example of that.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And, you know, there's, you know, after that, you know, that sold pretty well so they decided, hey, you know, we can start releasing games more for, you know, $15.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And then, they're all, you know, let's release another game for $20.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
And, you know, now we're getting a $20 price point game.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:29.000
So, I have a feeling that the, you know, trend now with the Wii where $49.99 seemed to be the kind of the cap.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Because, I mean, after all, a lot of the Wii games that were out there were being developed at the same time on the PlayStation 2.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
And, really, there is a limitation of what they can do with the hardware.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.000
But, I guess they're thinking now that the features are close enough to each other that now it warrants a higher price point.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I don't know if everybody's noticed that, you know, it's a higher price point and how many people actually game on the Wii like with, you know, Guitar Hero and stuff.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
But, that's kind of a disturbing trend.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Interesting comments in chat. Alfconanagram asks, was it the Penny Arcade game?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Now, that was the first $20 game. I know that was the first $20 game.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Yeah.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Then, Darkcharger says, I checked out Major Nelson's site and lots of users are unhappy about the $1200 price point.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Well, you know, you have to kind of look at both sides of it.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Is that, of course, people are going to be pissed they have to pay more.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
But, you have to kind of wonder, is it justified?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:23.000
You know what, for an in-depth game like the Penny Arcade game and Luminous and even the, well, Luminous nickel and dimed us to death a little bit.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.000
But, I'll say more, the Penny Arcade game, Braid, you know, a lot of these games are worth $10 to $15.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:42.000
You know what, you may not think so, but in my mind, the stuff that really was for $5 was the remakes of 80s video games, 80s video games where they didn't really do much to it.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Yeah.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I'm talking about the Pac-Mans, the Jiruses, the, you know, those old school, Froggers, those old school games where, you know, they didn't really do that much to it but reskin it.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
That was $5.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000
A lot of this other stuff that they're building from the ground up, you know what, face it, a lot of it's worth $10 if not more.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
But, here's my problem though.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.000
My problem is that these games, like for the Wii and Playstation 2 versions of like Guitar Hero 5.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Now, the only difference I can see with Guitar Hero 5, and this isn't even really, I think, justifying the fact that they can charge more,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
is with Guitar Hero 5, you know, I'm sure the graphics are gonna be the same in both versions.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I bet you anything they're developing them, the same company's probably developing both of them.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
The only difference is you'll probably get download content with the Wii version, which is fine.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Because, you know, right now I don't think World Tour has download content on the Wii.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Maybe they do, I don't remember, but I don't think they do.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I think Rock Band 2 is the only one that does it right now.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Okay, so maybe they feel that they're more justified for that.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000
But, at the same time, you're kind of ripping off the consumer who's gonna go and purchase more tracks online for more money.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Making more money in the long run.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:56.000
But, there's no way that these two games, like on the 360 and PS3, are gonna play exactly the same as the Wii version.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I mean, graphically, it's impossible that they're gonna look the same.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You know, I know that's not that important for a guitar hero game, but who cares?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
You know, there is a difference.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And, I think that the fact that all the Wii games out there have been, you know, $49.99.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Why should this change? I mean, Guitar Hero Metallica and stuff, the last few Guitar Hero games have been the same price.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
You know, why change it now?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And, same with Beatles Rock Band. What's the point?

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I mean, I know Beatles, it's gonna be a more, you know, I guess, developed game.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
It's a whole different style to it.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And, yeah, I'm sure that, you know, the graphics aren't gonna suffer too much, you know, on the Wii.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
But, still though, I think it's a rip-off.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And, I think we're gonna start seeing more games where it's like, oh, but look at all these extra features that we added in.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
But, you know what? You would have added those features anyways if you charged a $50 game.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And, maybe you should.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Because, you know, a lot of these Wii games out there aren't just, I can't justify the price point.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
You know what? I gotta be honest, I don't blame them.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I mean, on one level, it's the same damn game that you get on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
So, why shouldn't they be paying the same price?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Granted, I know the Wii is a more limiting system.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
But, at the same time, I mean, that's Nintendo's fault.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Not the developer.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Okay, so World Tour on the Wii does have download content, according to Act Def.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:16.000
So, then really, if they've done the same stuff on World Tour already and Rock Band 2,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000
if they both have download content, they're not really developing a new engine, I don't think, for these games, other than the art style.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So, I don't see where the cost is coming into play.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000
The cost isn't, I don't think, it's not an extra cost, Loki, it's the same cost.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
It's the same price point that they have on the other systems.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I mean, I know it sucks, 60 bucks for a game is very expensive, but it's not like you and I aren't gonna buy this game on the Wii anyway.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
We're gonna be spending the extra 10 bucks to get it on one of the better systems.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Or, when I say better, I mean, you know, with the better graphics and things that are tailored a little more to these games.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.000
But, in a way, I don't really fault the developer for it, they're charging the same price for the same game that they have on these other systems.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
If it can't technically pull off the same thing, that's Nintendo's fault.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I think, well, you know, fine, if people don't have a problem with this now, then don't balk at it when more of your favorite games come out at a $60 price point.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Wait until Nintendo figures this out, that they can charge $60 for your next Mario game or your Metroid game and stuff like that.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000
And, you know what? People aren't gonna balk at it, then why shouldn't they charge those prices? Let them shoot themselves in the foot.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:29.000
But, I wanna go back to the thing about the Xbox, you know, because if the games really aren't worth $60, they're not gonna sell.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000
There's gonna be a backlash, wait and see. I, you know, I would think twice about putting down $60 for some of the crap Nintendo picks out.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Well, I think this is almost like the same thing that, you know, like GameStop does with their Wii accessories, where they charge $5 over retail for them.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Because most consumers on the Wii don't know any better, and that's what it's gonna come down to.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Oh, well this Guitar Hero is $60 this time. Oh well, I'll just pay $60, and that's what it's gonna come down to.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:59.000
But, if no one's really putting up a fuss about it, then yeah, people are gonna start having to pay more.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I don't really care, cause like I said, I don't play these games on the Wii, so they can do whatever they want, but I'm just looking out for everybody else.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I wanna go back though and say quickly about the Xbox Live thing, because, you know, there's a lot of people that think all the games should be $5,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:22.000
or that, you know, all the games should be no more than $10. Well look, how can you say that the games should all be $10,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:30.000
and then you turn around and plunk down $1025, $1050 even, $11 in some cities, to go see a movie that might stink,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
and it's only 90 minutes long to maybe two and a half hours, you know what I mean?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Honestly, I think a $15 price point for a lot of games is justified.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Not all of them, some of them are real stinkers and don't have a thrill that lasts very long,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000
but I think $15, hell even $20 for some of the games, is actually kinda justified.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And you know what's good about Xbox Live and even the PlayStation Network? There's demos.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000
You can check them out first, you know, whereas like a movie, you can't, I mean I guess the trailer is sort of the demo for the movie,

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:05.000
but you know, you can't really check out Wii games. I mean, granted, you can probably get a good idea of what Guitar Hero 5 is going to be like in Beel's Rock Band,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
but there are no demos on the Wii. None. Unless you go to a kiosk.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Which is too bad, because I would actually probably buy more Wii things if I could demo them first.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I've bought, I think, four games on the Wii, WiiWare. I bought that Bit.Trip Beat, and I need to get the new one.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I bought Defend Your Castle, but that was only like a day one WiiWare, I want to see what a WiiWare game looks like type of thing,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
which, you know, wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great either.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I bought the Gradius Reimagining, which was pretty cool, and that actually might be it.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
No, Final Fantasy IV, I bought that, which was so far the best one out of the bunch.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So, you know, but even the Final Fantasy IV, the after years, that's going to be like $35 after all the episodes,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
but my whole thing is that, you know what, I paid $10 this week to see a 90 minute movie.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
If I get 30 hours of gameplay out of this $35, I think in a way that's money well spent.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
So, we'll see.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Joshi16 in chat says, the demo saved me $15 on Battlefield 1943. It isn't bad, just not for me.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And I think, you know, again, I think we talked about, you know, Battlefield 1943 definitely appeals to fans of a certain genre.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And to be fair, you know, with the Wii and music games are involved, they've actually been charging the same price points for bundles,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
like their, you know, instrument bundles and stuff like that.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I guess that's fine, whatever, you know, people haven't balked at that yet, and I guess they're not going to balk at this,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
but you know what, don't come complaining when all the games get more expensive.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
You know, hell, we're going through a recession and now all the games are going to get more expensive.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Because people need their entertainment.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Exactly, so you know, I don't know, not bothering me, but you know, like I said, I'm just bringing this up to everybody so that you notice,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
because you might not have, and you know, it is a big deal and you should let them know if you don't like it.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Alright, one more story for you guys before we get to the Classic Game of the Week,

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
and it's kind of one of those things where I really just want to let this guy rest in peace already,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
but I think we have to bring it up, and it's a story about Michael Jackson.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Apparently, what's going on right now, the MJJ Production Company, this is the people that were, you know,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Michael Jackson's kind of production company that did some various tie-in things that involved the Michael Jackson brand and image.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Apparently, they have confirmed to MCVUK, which is a website for news, obviously,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:39.000
that a game that stars Michael Jackson and featuring Michael Jackson music has actually been in production at MJJ Productions

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
for several months, and supposedly it's going to be out this holiday season.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
So that's, you know, before he, you know, obviously died, they were already working on this game.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000
They have not said what the game is, no information about the developer, what the heck it's about.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Some people are wondering, but they did say Michael Jackson loved games, which, you know, if you consider all the...

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Did you see the pictures of his arcade?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Dude, I wanted to buy the BeatMania machine. They were only asking like a thousand dollars for it.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I want his pinball tables. I want the pinball tables.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Yeah, I know, but unfortunately now that he passed away, all that stuff's going to triple in value, so there's no way I can have it now.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But if he had still been alive, I was so going to get that BeatMania machine.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
How awesome would that be to own something that Michael Jackson once had?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I was saving the money to get that BeatMania machine. I'm not even kidding.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I looked at it.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Were you? Would I have been bidding against you? Probably.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Didn't he have a DDR machine? I think he had a DDR machine.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I think he did.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I would have totally bought that.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
So anyway, regardless, unfortunately now none of us are going to be able to afford that.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I don't want any of his arcade games. I don't have room for arcade games.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
See, I do.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I still want a DDR machine, though.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
I have that garage. I could totally...

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Wouldn't you love, in the OLR studio, the old one anyway, a BeatMania machine sitting in the corner?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
They're not really all that hard to find. You just have to know where to look.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Yeah, but I want the one that Michael Jackson had. That's got a story behind it.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Alright, well forget it.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Anyhow, here's the thing.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.000
One possible idea is that maybe this isn't a new game, but it could be like Moonwalker on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Which, considering the flurry of Genesis revivals we've seen, is certainly a possibility.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Who knows? Maybe even Space Channel 5, because Michael Jackson did play a role in Part 2.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Ah, I somehow did that.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Even both!

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I think, if anything, it would be like...

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
He had a major role in 2, though.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
That's true.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It could be like a music game that had a tie-in with his new comeback tour that he was gonna do.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Or something.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
You know, Frisbee has an interesting comment in chat.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
What about SingStar Michael Jackson?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
That's not a bad thought.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Especially now.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
That would be cool. I would love to see a Michael Jackson rock band game.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Would be so awesome.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I think it's inevitable you're gonna see something maybe next year.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Maybe that'll be the next rock band game.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
That would actually be pretty sweet, I've gotta say.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
That would be awesome.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
But, I don't know. Does a lot of his music cater to the rock band series of instruments?

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I mean, they played instruments, okay? They had guitars and drums.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
We had Slash.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Therefore, it will work.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I guess that's true.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I guess it could happen, but, I mean, you know, if you want to talk about, you know,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000
since they went all out for the Beatles with the whole reskinning and reimagining of the game's interface,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I think Michael Jackson is at that same level, you know, right up there with ABBA.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Okay, in all seriousness, Michael Jackson is definitely at that level.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
If you change your mind.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
What?

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Nothing.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Or Journey. I'm the first in line?

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Yes.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Honey, I'm still free. Yes, or Journey.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Take a chance on Michael.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000
But let's face it, you know, despite my personal taste, Michael Jackson is universally at that level,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
where I could see them doing a whole game about him. Who knows?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Marissa Cungusto in chat confirms there are guitar parts on 70% of his songs, believe it or not.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I guess that makes sense.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
You know, I just made it, what was that for?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Guitar Hero World Tour.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Was it really?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Yeah.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Interesting.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
God, I hope it's not a Guitar Hero game.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Isn't that sad that I say that?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I hope it's not Guitar Hero.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I hope it's Rock Band.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000
But just looking at the Beatles versus Van Halen, you can just tell which one had more effort put into it.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I'm sorry.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Sorry developers of Van Halen who spent time on it, but you just didn't spend enough time?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Alright, let's get into a segment here on the show we like to call the Classic Video Game of the Week.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Now, Dark Sakura has already hinted during her gaming week that she took a trip down memory lane this week with Tiara, I think?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Yeah, I played that by myself, but we did go to the pinball thing together.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Okay, well, but there's a classic video game of the week that Dark Sakura played this week that she thinks,

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
you know what, maybe all the kiddies should be playing this game this week.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Video Game of the Week?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
The Classic Game of the Week is Seiken Densetsu 3.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:01.000
And it is the sequel to what we got as Secret of Mana.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Let's hear a little clip.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Right now our adventurers are in a little cave.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Yeah, sadly all of the music that I found was either the entire music or boss battle stuff, but I found this leading up to a boss battle.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
The other one, I think, was a boss battle.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I'll play after that.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
But this one is actually very unique.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:41.000
You have a bunch of different classes, you have six characters, each of them have their own stories, and you play them in a combination.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:53.000
So basically the way that you start, it's got the same type of real-time combat, you've got the same ring menu as Secret of Mana, but it's just different.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:02.000
You've got, of course, your magic attributes on each character that sort of changes exactly how well they can use certain things.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:10.000
You also can change your class by going light or dark, and then light light, light dark, dark light, and dark dark.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And you change up the first one at level 18 with a mana stone, or the next one is 38 with a special item.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
So it's sort of different.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Also, with most of your enemies, you can actually run away from them, you can disengage your fight.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:41.000
But your boss battles, you pretty much end up locked into your boss battles, so you've got all that.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:50.000
You can, when you defeat all the enemies on screen, you can actually get a treasure chest, and it has a prize in it.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
So that's cool.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:12.000
But the difference is that instead of setting their range and aggression, you actually set how they actually fight in battle, like whether or not they want to do support, or area effect, or an individual target,

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:23.000
or if you're going to use your full power gauge, if you're going to use your full magic gauge, or if they're going to use magic if you control how they cast their magic.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But as far as the leveling up, you've also got the class system, you can change to a light class or a dark class, and you've got different abilities based on each of those.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:47.000
You also have a different day of the week, where an elemental spirit is in charge of that day, and based on that day, that type of magic will be stronger.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Like you have Luna Day for Moon, Salamander Day for Fire, Undine Day for Water, Dryad Day for Wood, Jin Day for Wind, Gnome Day for Earth, and Mana Holy Day, where all of your magic is balanced.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:12.000
So you'd have, of course, a different elemental showing on your screen to indicate what day it is.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:32.000
With this one you play as different characters, they've actually been, there is a very fantastic fan translation in English that actually has all the in-game sprites translated into English, so it is a 100% translation.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I remember when that first came out, that was a big fucking deal when that thing first came out.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Oh yeah, it was a big big deal, but your characters in this are, you have Angela, who is a princess with magic power, you have Doran, who is a swordsman, you have Hawkeye, who is a thief,

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Bryce, who is from the Wind Kingdom, Kevin, you have Charlotte, the Dark Prince, you've got all these different characters, but when you start off with your six, you start off with a main character and then choose two to partner with them.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So you are playing through different, you know, the story you can play through at a different time each time based on who your main person is and then who's hanging out with them.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:42.000
So it's pretty neat. It really is, especially with that translation, it really is fantastic. I mean, it is seriously the best to play.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:33:01.000
For anyone who, of course, the only way really to play this hack unless you've got some kind of cartridge conversion kit is through an emulator and I can say right now it runs very very well in the different ones that I've played it on.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And it plays on Linux! You can do good games on Linux. So I think it's well worthwhile. I love that boss right there.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Looks like a giant pumpkin head, but the actual name of the boss is Ms. Palm.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.000
One of the bosses in the game is Jenova, with a G instead of a J.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:34.000
So yeah, I totally think that it is, I think honestly for SNES RPGs, this one is about the pinnacle.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Now I apologize if I missed it somewhere in your review, but any word on why Square didn't release this over here?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I don't know.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Just pure stupidity? Lack of faith? The fact that Secret of Evermore did not live up to expectations?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Well, actually, I'm trying to do some look over. They said that Secret of Evermore was supposed to have been Seiken Densetsu 3, but they brought out something else. I don't really know the whole story on it, but they said...

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Secret of Evermore was Square USA. It was like one of the only games Square USA ever did. It might be the only game Square USA ever did, and it didn't do that hot over here.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Actually, I owned it. It's not a bad game. It's just not super.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Well, part of the other reason is that they were saying that Square was deciding not to translate any more titles for a long time, and they said that it would have been too costly to produce.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I know, but hey, at least someone picked it up and did it. I honestly would love to see them buy the fan translation, pay for the time and effort that went into translating it, and bring it out on DS.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Pay for it with a legal order?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:18.000
You know what I mean. I'd like to see them at least get compensated for all the hard work, because it had to have been a lot of work, especially since you basically had to ROM hack it to change all the sprites, too.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
So it was very well done. It's a brilliant job.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Well, there you have it, your classic video game of the week, Seiken Densetsu 3, sometimes known as the lost Secret of Mana title.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:38.000
That's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but there's plenty more of the show to come. We're just going to take a quick break. We'll be back in just a little bit.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:51.000
We've got still more stories to talk about in part B tonight. We have rapid fire news, your emails, the FUs of the week, and some more stories, including a story on Scribblenauts, and, wait for it, nudity in part B.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000
That's right, we're going to get naked in part B tonight. No, just kidding, but we're going to talk about nudity.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, July the 12th of 2009, where we are taping our 331st episode of Orange Lounge Radio live on All Games Radio, our wonderful radio site that lets us do our show live here every Sunday night.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:35.000
It's available at www.allgames.com. Of course, there's lots of other great programming on All Games Radio throughout the week. They have some stuff during the day, a program that's running every day at about, I think, 3 o'clock Pacific, and then they've got some other podcasts that syndicate on the network.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:45.000
And, of course, another live show before us on Sunday nights, Bobby Black Wolf, a show that Dark Soccer and myself were on many, many, many years ago under Sedation Live on Saturday night.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Lots and lots of good stuff on All Games Radio, so check it out at www.allgames.com. We're going to get back into the video game news now, though, for tonight, and we've got some rapid-fire news.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Dark Sakura, give us the rundown on some of the other news that happened this week in the gaming world.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Well, what we're seeing for $4.99 arriving on the iPhone through the App Store is Worms 2, or, I'm sorry, is actually Worms for iPod and iPod Touch. It has 14 multiplayer unlockable items and 50 different challenges to do by yourself.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.000
You can customize your team names. So, it's Worms.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
So, if you want to be Team Worm, you can.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
You can be Team Wiggle Worm if you want.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I'd rather be D-Wormed.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Can I be Team Worm in my pants?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
How about some Xbox stuff?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000
The Xbox Live Arcade Summer of Arcade Games has dates.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time re-shelled to be on the 22nd of July. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 with 56 characters coming the week after that.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:07.000
On August 5th is Lotion Man, and it's a character who can explode himself at will.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Yes, he gets very angry and explodes himself. That musical cue is entirely planned.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.000
There's 50 single player and 50 multiplayer levels. Trials HD on the 12th of August.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000
It's a motorbike racer, 50 tracks, 2 modes, custom, blah blah blah.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Shadow Complex on the 19th of August, which is a side-scrolling adventure game.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Metroidvania game.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Yeah, Metroidvania.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And they will all be 1200 Microsoft points, except for Splosion Man, which will be 800 points.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:46.000
And, also, some stuff for Guitar Hero 5, actually.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:55.000
There are 24 songs already confirmed. There will be 84 bands appearing in it.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:02.000
But we've got Band of Horses, Beastie Boys, Beck, Billy Squier, Blur. I love Blur.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Bob Dylan, Children of Bodom, Coldplay, Darkest Hour, David Bowie, Deep Purple.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Elliott Smith, Iggy Pop. I love Iggy Pop.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Jeff Beck, John Mellencamp, Kings of Leon, Queens of the Stone Age, Rose Hill Drive, Santana,

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
The Bronx, Thrice, Tom Petty, Runnin' Down a Dream. That's a great song.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Vampire Weekend, and Wolf Mother.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
And, that's it.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Alright. What's also interesting, though, is before that got announced,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.000
there was actually a full track list that's been rumored to be put out there.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.000
And, ironically enough, actually all those artists were on there, including a bunch of other artists.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And, I'm just going to give you some highlights here with their songs.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Rammstein with Do Host is going to be in there, which I think is pretty sweet.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
But rumor, right? As opposed to Dark Soccer's thing being fact, this is rumor, right?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Although, by coincidence, or not, all of the things on the rumor list ended up being on the confirm list, right?

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Yes.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Okay. I just want to make sure that's clear.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Yes. Of course, Queen and David Bowie, Under Pressure.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Let's see here. Also, a couple of Tom Petty songs.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Tom Petty, Runnin' Down a Dream, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, American Girl.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:33.000
They even have the Gorillaz in the game with Feel Good Inc., which will be kind of interesting.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Blur Song 2, Bon Jovi, You Give Love a Bad Name, and many, many more.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
But, very interesting.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I have to say, if that is real, which it sounds like it is, it's actually a pretty freakin' good list for Guitar Hero.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:54.000
As much crap as I've given the Guitar Hero franchise, I will say this song list does make me want to buy Guitar Hero 5.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
It's a pretty good song list.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Assuming that it's all correct.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Which it probably is.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Yes.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:09.000
And then, a little bit of bad news. We talked about last week that there was a rumor that maybe the PSP Go was a little bit faster.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000
That, you know, they may have upped the processor to 480 MHz.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Yeah, unfortunately, that wouldn't be the case. Actually, that processor speed was referring to the USB speed and not the CPU.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.000
So, no, the PSP Go is still not worth your $250. Sorry.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And then, finally, EA made booboo this week, posting on their Twitter an announcement for Command & Conquer 4.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:46.000
And, kind of jumping the gun a bit. Actually, it did get later officially announced in the next coming days.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:54.000
But, apparently, it was kind of funny because they had the announcement, you know, EA Los Angeles announces the development of Command & Conquer 4.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:01.000
And then they had a link to a press release that wasn't there yet. So, later they added a press release and it was announced.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Dope.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
But, still funny.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Aren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Yeah, I'm a fan of Red Alert and I actually skipped the last one. I don't know why.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000
But, yeah, I'm a fan of editing those to death just like I do Grand Theft Auto 4.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Alright. Well, just a handful more stories for you here for rapid fire news tonight.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Starting off with Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. Did you know some download content was originally planned for the game?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
But, after all of Midway's troubles, it looks like the download content may, in fact, be shelves.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Apparently, according to Ed Boon, who was the co-creator, of course, of Mortal Kombat, some appearances from Kung Lao and Doomsday, apparently, were going to be included in the game.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:48.000
On his Twitter, actually, Quan Chi, who is from Mortal Kombat 4 originally, the character design for that character showed up on his Twitter.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000
So, it looks like there was definitely some stuff planned.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Unfortunately, now, though, according to Ed Boon, quote, right now, I don't see it happening.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Apparently, all the code, though, for the characters was just about done, but, unfortunately, now, all the attention is focused on Mortal Kombat 9.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I guess you can thank all of Midway's recent troubles for that.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.000
One thing that you can download right now, though, for free, even, Elder Scrolls II Daggerfall.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.000
You may have heard of Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, because that was a huge game a couple years ago, and I'm sure Elder Scrolls V.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I'm surprised there's not been an announcement of this, but I guess, you know, Fallout 3 was where Bethesda was putting all their resources.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
But I'm pretty sure next year, I bet you next E3, you're going to see Elder Scrolls V.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Well, if you want to go back to the past and explore the roots of the Elder Scrolls series, you can go back to Elder Scrolls II Daggerfall.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:43.000
It is now free for download. All you have to do is go onto the website, www.elderscrolls.com, and it's now available in the download section.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
So, if you want to take a piece of gaming's history, there you go.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Also, it should be pointed out that the very first Elder Scrolls game, Elder Scrolls Arena, actually had come out already before.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000
So, who knows? Maybe Morrowind will come out in a few more years.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000
One more story for you guys tonight, and that has to do with the ever-asked-about Kid Icarus game.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Apparently, somebody had asked Miyamoto about it at E3, and his response,

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Wait, please!

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Actually, he didn't say it really like that. I just said it that way for dramatic effect.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
But he did say, Wait, please! I'm really surprised how popular that is.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
But you're the first person to ask this at E3, was apparently his comment about that.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I can't believe that was the first time. I think that was the first time someone had the balls to ask him about it at E3.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
But I know it's something a lot of people are asking.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
It's the first time that you've asked me about that.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Apparently. You know, but that's better than no.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
But I don't know. A lot of people are maybe reading a bit too much into that.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Wait, please! Which, by the way, I love that response. I'm gonna use that. I'm gonna try to use that on the show more often.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Wait, please! It does seem a little bit hopeful, but I don't know. I don't know.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:56.000
We'll see, though. Perhaps that's another thing that's coming to E3 2010, but of course, that's just what all the fanboys think. Yes?

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Wait, please!

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
That's just like, as Frisbee says in chat, Heal, please!

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Cure, please! Wait, please!

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
How about the game, please?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
How about emails, please?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Every week, you guys send us your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we take a few of them and we read them right here on the show.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Dark Soccer is gonna dive into the Mailbag head first, pull out some of our favorite emails, and read them for you tonight in our Mailbag segment.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Ooh!

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Mail- Whoa, what the hell? That's not the Mailbag song. What the crap?

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
How about this instead? Alright, here is the Mailbag song.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
There, much better.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Correct song, please.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Shut up!

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Wait, please!

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, Dark Soccer.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Hi, OLR crew. I was wondering what you guys thought about the concept of 3D gaming.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I already know PC gamers can do this, but a compatible monitor and shutter glasses can run you $500 or more.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Once prices even out to about $100, would any of you think this would be a popular way to play?

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Would people really want to do this? Would you expect 3D to come out for console?

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I hope you guys could provide some input. Oh, and rob a facepalm.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
For what?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
I don't know. By the way-

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Explanation, please.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.000
We've had 3D games that used glasses. Hi, we had-

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
The Virtual Boy.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000
That doesn't count. I'm talking about Master System games.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
You remember?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Oh, yeah!

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.000
And a few NES games. Actually, there was a version of-

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Rad Racer had 3D. Remember that?

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.000
And it was a game that actually was a predecessor to Space Harrier.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
It was called Adventure 3D World or something on the Nintendo?

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Oh, yeah! 3D World Runner. I remember that game.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
That was a 3D World Runner.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
So, yeah. That's been out and it's failed.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Yeah, but a lot of those were just little flash in the pan stupid things.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I mean, let's say there was a legitimate console based around-

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Let's face it. Technology's come a long way since the days of the Amazing Red-

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000
I'm sorry, the Amazing Red Seizure Inducing Headache Machine.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
AKA the Virtual Boy. Technology's come a long way since then.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
You know, what if they did-

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Especially, look at what they're doing with a lot of 3D movies.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Like, if you haven't seen Up in 3D, it's actually pretty cool.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And a lot of these technologies that they're doing with 3D movies-

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I could see something like this going towards video gaming in the near future.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Perhaps in the next generation of consoles.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I think that's more what our emailer's asking about.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Maybe not so much this flash in the pan crap we've seen in the past.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
What if they built a whole new console with today's technology out of 3D gaming?

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Would it be something you'd be interested in?

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
My honest answer is no.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Because 3D gaming still feels like a flash in the pan to me.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And you know what? Even after watching Up, I had a bit of a headache after a couple hours.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I think it's just a lot for your brain to process in that amount of time.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
I saw Nightmare in 3D. Twice.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:59.000
So, I really think that 3D just- it suits movies more, it really does.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Or like those little 3D rides like, you know, the Muppet Show in 3D.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
That type of thing.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Or Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
You know, here's my honest answer.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:15.000
If I see the game that convinces me I need the 3D, then I'll be a little more sold on it.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000
But I think it's one of those things where I think the great 3D game idea hasn't been fully realized yet.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
But who knows? Is it a possibility in the future? Of course.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
You're gonna see 3D games again.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
It's just a matter of time.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
We're inching closer and closer to the holodeck.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I wish.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Next up is from Robert M. Thank you very much for getting the podcast caught up.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Lately I haven't been able to tune in live due to long work hours as your show here in the Midwest runs until 11pm.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
And I get up around 5am to get ready for the bus.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I'm wondering why Black Wolf isn't caught up with his show, especially since he's able to get his Friday night show on the feed the next day like clockwork.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Looking forward to this week's show.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
I won't answer for anybody else.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I know. We can't answer for anybody else.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
But we will say it's a lot of work.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:15.000
And I do know for a fact he does edit the show not in a way that's gonna edit the content of the show.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
But he does it to make it sound very professional.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
He takes out a lot of the dead air and things that we really should do but are too lazy to.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
So that's a lot of work.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I know you guys think it's just easy to slap it together and put it on the podcast but it does take me a good 30-45 minutes to tie the two parts of the show into one.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Take out the beginning. Take out the end.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Upload it to the feed which is the biggest part and then write the description.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
You know it does take a little bit of time.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
And you know obviously we do it because that's part of the thing we do for signing up for the show.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
But just you know it can't always happen right away.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And I know a lot of folks understand that.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
I'm not saying you know don't complain.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:58.000
You know and I'm sure for Bobby who edits the show even further for contextual purposes it's even more so.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
So you know cut the dude some slack.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
He works hard doing two shows.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
One more quick note.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I gave my impressions of Faze a year or so ago and recently upgraded my old video iPod due to dead pixels to an 80 gig about I sorry 80 gig iPod classic.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
It really improves playing games.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:25.000
The older unit had to search for the games and would usually give a game could not be played message before finally successfully loading.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Whereas the game loads on us immediately on the classic.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Also the battery life is far improved.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Between the solitaire game that comes with it and recently the iPod version.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Not to be confused with the iPhone one of peggle.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
It's admittedly been a while since I've played my DS Lite.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:48.000
P.S. I probably won't get Lego Rock Band but I would get a Rock Band Lego set in a heartbeat.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.000
It is interesting how far iPod gaming has come since like Faze.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
I mean Faze is only what like a year and a half two years old.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
It is very interesting to see how far the games have come.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:05.000
You know we've gone from Faze to Tap Tap Revenge to you know peggle on the iPhone is pretty sweet.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.000
I hope you guys got it during the 99 cent deal because it's at a buck.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Way got that.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
It's a steal.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Way got that.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And by the way I don't know if you.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
We tried to post about it on the Twitter because I don't think we had it during a show time.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:22.000
But Columns and Puyo Puyo was free for a limited time over the 4th of July weekend.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
And I know.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Got it.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000
We posted about it on Twitter.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
You texted me about that.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I have to be honest I wasn't a fan of how the game controlled because.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I didn't try it yet.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Well without a directional pad you kind of have to use the touch screen to control it.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.000
And the tilt kind of controls how fast the pieces drop.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
So you can only hold your iPhone in a certain way.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
So I'm a little iffy on it.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
But hey.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Free.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Not gonna complain.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Yeah.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Even though I am.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
And it's not yours.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Very true.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Last email from Dan Shadow.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000
As I'm writing this Tales of Monkey Island is on my desktop waiting to be played.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
When the launcher for the game popped up a thought came to mind.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Sometime around this time last year I sent you guys my first email.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
By then I'd become a regular listener of the podcast.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I just never sent anything your way.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
The email was about adventure, gaming, and where it went.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Sam & Max was the only one around at that time.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Hell the Strong Bad games weren't even announced at that point.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Not to mention a forthcoming announcement on Wallace & Gromit.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I remember mentioning how cool Monkey Island and Loom were.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Now here I am a year later waiting to play a brand new Monkey Island game.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:34.000
I just wanted to give a toast to video games and how they bring us such joy before popping the cork on episode 1.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
I also want you guys to pat yourselves on the back to always being there.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
For being the outsiders looking into the world of video games.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
And for making a lengthy show that helps me in the long hours of work.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Did you know that OLR is a special tab that people can now add to their personalized Yahoo front page?

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
That's how I found the show.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Completely by accident. Accidentally awesome.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Really? How do you do that? I've never even heard of that.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
I don't know.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I think it's just RSS feeds.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Interesting. I never really looked into that. That's cool.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:12.000
P.S. The email I sent a while back about chocolate and flowers, that was a Punch Out Wii reference.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
P.P.S. I heard Loom is coming out on Steam soon. Is that true?

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Oh hell yeah. My ass downloaded it already.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Oh god yeah. Like a ton of the LucasArts stuff came out this week.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I'll tell you what. I came close to buying Loom on freaking TurboGrafx.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Nice.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
I found a place in town that has it but they want like 35 bucks for it.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Still.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I'm close. I'm close.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
What store is that?

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Fairgame.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Oh okay.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I'm giving them advertising.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
She told me off air just so you know.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:49.000
I'm giving... I'll go ahead and say it. It's Fairgame. They're pretty good guys. A little high priced but...

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
They have arcade machines in their store which is kind of fun.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Really? I've never been there. In all the years I've...

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
I've only been there once.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I should check it out.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
They sell Saturn games.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
We were gonna go to...

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
They actually do case mods and they do disc resurfacing.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Jeff and I were gonna go to Denial's today but I was like...

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000
The realist of me knew I wouldn't be able to get out of bed early enough to go because it's the weekend and this is where I catch up on my sleep.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000
But don't they sell arcade games out there once in a while too?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Yeah.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
They sell Saturns.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I'm gonna go on a spree at Denial's.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Trader Dan moved out there too I think.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Nice.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
They don't sell full sized arcade games out there.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Really?

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
No. You'd be hard pressed to find that stuff because you'd have to have like...

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
You'd have to go to the labels and sit down once.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
There the last time I went to Denial's.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:37.000
There's this one guy that's outside of the flea market proper that has arcade games.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
It's like in that little outside place by where the guy sells the mini donuts.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I'll check it out. I haven't been to Denial's in like six years.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.000
By the way, it's a giant flea market by the way for those that have no idea what I'm talking about.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
A little place here locally in town.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.000
But we actually did just buy a game from Fear Game.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000
We bought Captain America and the Avengers for Genesis.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Nice.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Because the SNES one is ass!

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000
And Dan totally reminded me of something and I totally think this is the truest thing.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
It's funny when you go fight the Mandarin and he's like,

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Behold my power!

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
And then you kill him in five seconds.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Nice.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
So, yeah. Anyway, this one.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Alright, that was the last email.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Loom is on Steam. Go get it.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
That was the last email, huh? We need more emails.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Yeah, and you need to stop telling Twitter to email me.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Mailbag at orangeloungerator.com.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
One tip I gave Twitter, by the way, today was,

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
You know, if you're going to tell us,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Hey, have you guys seen this news story?

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
And it was like a really big story.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Chances are, yes, we saw the story and we're going to cover it in the show.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
We want to know your thoughts.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
So, make sure in your emails you tell us your opinion on anything you send us.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
I mean, it's cool.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.000
But I don't want to say don't send us stories because sometimes we do get some cool stuff that we hadn't heard.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
But if it was a big story that ran on every blog,

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Yes, we probably heard of it and are talking about it during the show.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
But we want to know your thoughts.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000
It's always about your voice.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Every gamer has a voice, remember?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
So, mailbag at orangeloungerator.com is the place to send your emails.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Let's talk about some more gaming stories with a few more stories before your phone calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
We've got about five stories for you guys first.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Loki.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Uh oh, it's another rumor about PSP 2.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Oh my goodness.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000
But yes, of course, you know with the PSP Go coming out,

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I guess they've got to be working on a sequel to that.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Because, hey, why not?

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Anyways, the rumor is that the PSP 2 is apparently already in development.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:33.000
And that according to some inside info that Eurogamer is allegedly claiming,

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
that they've got their hands on information that,

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Imagine technology's power VR tech will be an important part of the device.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.000
And since without getting into too many technical specifics,

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.000
the chip code named Hydra will allow for 133 million polygons per second,

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
and a filtrate of 4G pixels per second.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:01.000
The highest, with higher potential chip speeds, obviously allowing for more graphical power.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:07.000
They said that, suggested the ballpark will match the original Xbox.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
So, you know, that's not bad.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
You know, PlayStation 2 quality graphics, that kind of makes sense.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000
And apparently the chip, I guess, will act as both the GPU and the CPU simultaneously,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:24.000
increasing power and efficiency, and helping other areas of the programming for the device.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000
And that's just rumor right now, but we probably won't be hearing about anything,

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
you know, for the PSP 2 until like next year.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Obviously, probably until next year.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Because why would they announce the PSP 2's coming out?

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.000
That would be hilarious if they announced the PSP 2 coming out before the Go came out.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Just seeing the further ruin the Go's potential of actually selling.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
But, uh, I don't know.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I'm still not fully sure I understand what the Hydra chip does.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
You know, I'm not as big into hardware stuff.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
What exactly will the Hydra chip mean for this system?

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Basically, it's just a powerful chip that's going to process both, you know,

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.000
the graphics stuff and, you know, the actual game processing.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:08.000
It's just a chip that's using, I guess, PowerVR, that technology.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:13.000
It's just going to basically make, you know, games look like the PlayStation 2

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
able to be played on a portable system.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
But will it blend?

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Everything blends.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Oh, okay. Well, that's the important thing, I guess.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Very interesting, though, that we are getting all these details about the PSP 2

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
with the PSP Go still on the horizon.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I mean, this is something that's happened at SonyCamp before.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Not to pinpoint that that only happens to Sony,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
because I seem to remember this whole little, like...

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
The Gizmondo?

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Yeah, you kind of hear about these things,

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
or the newer N-Gage while the other N-Gage was still out, you know.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
No, that was the Gizmondo.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Oh, by the way, we're going to release a widescreen version of the system

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000
and blah, blah, blah before the actual system comes out.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Yeah, that didn't help.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Tigerclaw in chat says a graphic chip that powerful also means low battery life.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Unless they figure out something, you know.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Well, what if this is just a unit?

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
I mean, I'm surprised we don't see a unit that just plugs right into the wall.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.000
And I'm not even talking about with a charger or anything like that.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000
You just flip out the little plug thing and just plug it right in the wall.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Wouldn't that be cool?

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
No, it's supposed to be a portable system.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Why the hell do I have to be tethered to a wall?

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
No, no, no. To charge it.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Like, the batteries built in.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Like a cell phone.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Yeah, it should be.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Yeah, it should be, but...

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
But then, they couldn't select the replacement batteries,

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
or the upgrade batteries, or all the other fun stuff.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
I mean, I'm not even talking about, like, okay,

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
because probably folks are going, you retard DS and PSP, do that,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
where you plug them into the wall.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I'm talking about without even an AC adapter.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Like, you just flick out the little, like, you know, I don't...

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
You flick out the little plug in the back and just plug it right in your wall.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Like your cell phone, like you said.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Yeah, I know. Well, not all cell phones have that either.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Yeah.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.000
I don't know.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Well, here's...

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Why don't they do something like...

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Well, actually, they're sort of working on technology for that,

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
where you can charge stuff wirelessly,

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.000
where you actually have, you know, for example, they have Wii batteries

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:04.000
that you can get for the remotes that will actually charge through everything.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
That is scary. How does that work?

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
I don't know. Blackmagic, apparently.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
That is... wow.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
But, yeah, they have them.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
You know, actually, they sell them now.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:16.000
You can buy them.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000
You basically sit the controller onto, you know, the pad.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000
It doesn't have any contacts. You can leave that stupid silicon thing on it and stuff.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000
And apparently it charges, you know, through the air.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
So that's kind of scary, because I don't want electricity flying through the air,

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
electrocuting me, you know.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.000
That is kind of strange how that works. Technology's weird.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
But, yeah, I want to say Energizer had one.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Frisbee says it's powered by hamsters.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I'm just going to believe that, that there's miniature hamsters

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.000
and those things that power them, instead of electricity flying through the air.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Like a bad science fiction movie.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
I'll see if I can find the information on it, because it's just...

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
It makes it sound like... remember those globes?

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000
And I'm sure they still have them, but they were popular when I was a kid.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Like, you know, you'd see on, like, Mr. Wizard's World and shit,

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
like the big globes that had the lightning in them.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.000
There's still those at Spencer's Rob.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
And then when you put your fingers on the edge of them,

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
the lightning bolts jump to your fingers.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
That's what I think of when I hear this whole charging through the air.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Like, I think, like, my house is going to turn into one of those globes.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Yeah, it's, um...

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.000
I know...

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Oh, this is one of them, I think.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Was it the Incharge?

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Oh, wait, that's not one. Never mind.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
But yeah, I want to say it was, like, Energizer or something like that that put it out.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000
It was one battery company. I can't remember who put it out.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
But it's crazy looking.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Oh, Energizer. Here it is.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Uses induction charging, is what it is.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
And, um...

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Yeah, Energizer Wiimote Wireless Induction Charger.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000
That's scary shit.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Black magic, I say. It's black magic.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
It's a witch!

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
It's a witch! Burn the witch!

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
We found a witch. May we burn her?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
All right, well, look.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Moving on to something else you might be able to get a charge out of.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
How about nudity?

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Let's talk about full frontal nudity.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
And a story that ran on VideoGamer.com about BioWare.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Of course, BioWare was the studio behind Mass Effect,

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.000
which, you might remember, caused quite a stir behind one of its titillating lovemaking scenes in the game Mass Effect.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Well, there is an RPG coming out called Dragon Age Origins.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
And apparently, BioWare is currently debating if the game should contain full frontal nudity,

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
because the game does have some sex scenes in it.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
More cock!

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000
So, apparently, the sex will be portrayed in cutscene-controlled environments only.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000
There is not going to be any type of gameplay, so sorry, no hot coffee mini-game,

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
where you control the thrusting or what have you.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
It's part of the cinematics.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:59.000
But apparently, in the game, you are going to be able to have sex with computer-controlled party members

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.000
in order to improve your relationship with them.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Like real life.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Apparently, this game was actually shown to the press behind closed doors at E3,

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
so that means we wouldn't have seen it.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000
But the sex scenes were not shown in full.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000
They were cut very short after they started.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.000
By the way, of course, Mass Effect allowed the characters to have sex.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
But here's the thing.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.000
When VideoGamer.com asked the BioWare Vice President, Greg Zestchuk,

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
he replied, quote,

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
I don't think we've worked that out yet, because we can adjust that whenever we want, right?

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.000
On Mass Effect, we worked extensively to figure out how do we want to portray it.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.000
It's not ogling pixels.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Sad, but probably titillating, too.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000
I think for us, it's more just making sure it fits the context of what we're trying to create.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
So, in other words, what I hear is, we'll show the titties if it's for artistic purposes only,

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000
like most actresses in Hollywood say about the nude scenes they do.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.000
It has to be for artistic purposes.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
So, here's my thing.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Look, video games are inching closer and closer to movies, right?

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:10.000
I'm especially thinking about Lost Odyssey, the game I've been playing this week.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.000
The story in that game is very emotional.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
And I admit, I get very verklempt at some of the things that happen in that game.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
There's some very emotion-driving scenes in that.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
And they do use cut scenes to portray this.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Now, granted, Lost Odyssey is not going to show titties,

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
because it doesn't fit the context of the game.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000
But what's wrong with some tits in a video game?

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Especially, you know, you can't, on one hand, say titties in movies is okay,

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
and say that tits in games is a bad thing.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I mean, it's just...

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Boobs!

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.000
It's just cock, and it's just vag.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I mean, really.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
It's just a body part.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
But I don't understand why our culture gets so wrapped up in this.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Especially when, oh my god, there might be tits in a video game.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000
So what? My god, do you know how violent games have gotten?

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:00.000
We've heard every word possible in a game at this point.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
I mean, fuck, shit, cock, they've all been in a video game at some point.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000
And even if, you know, they weren't in the game,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
many kids put them in anyway as the name of their characters.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Like, you know, who didn't have that Final Fantasy party

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
where all your character names were cock, piss, tits, and ball?

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
I actually didn't. I named mine after my friends.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Whatever. You know what I'm getting at, though, right?

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:23.000
You know, if games are getting closer and closer to movies,

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:26.000
if it fits the context of the game, why not?

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
I mean, and it's not like we've never had it before.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.000
I mean, God of War had it, and, you know, we've seen them in other games.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Final Fantasy VII, the big deal with that was that Barret cussed.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
I mean, really, what's the big deal?

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
It's just people who, you know, got a big butt up their butt.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
A butt up their butt?

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
I said a bug up their butt.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I thought you said a big butt up their butt.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Isn't that a little redundant?

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
No, they have a big bug up their butt.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Who heard that phrase before?

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Frisbee in Chat says, because boobs are worse than decapitation.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Sadly, in our culture, it seems that way, doesn't it?

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.000
It's because the people are so freaking repressed.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
I mean, seriously.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
And this is what I say about damn near everything.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
You stop making such a big fucking deal out of it, and guess what?

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
It stops being a big fucking deal.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:24.000
It was like, okay, for example, you can say fuck now, okay?

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I was always able to say fuck.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Let me finish.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:36.000
200 years ago, if you said fuck, you could be put in stocks and displayed for being profane.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
What the fuck?

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
But you see what I mean.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Our language has evolved.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Our idea of morality has evolved.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:50.000
I could go on and on about that.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
It's just...

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
They're gonna die, Rob.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:02.000
All those people with the big moral, you know, stick up their butt, so I don't say, you know, bug up their butt.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:07.000
They have this big oak tree growing up their ass.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
They're...

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
They're gonna die?

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
They're gonna die. Okay.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Me, some people are gonna die?

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.000
You know what I mean, though.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
People are gonna move on.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Never did you bring that up again, Rob.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:29.000
What is morally acceptable today is going to be tame, tame, tame, you know, 30 years from now.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
It's just...

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:35.000
There's always gonna be a different, you know...

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
There's always gonna be repressed people out there.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Why do we have a comment in chat from leechum6 that says,

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.000
I think DarkSakura should shove Loki's butt up Rob's butt.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
How mature are we, people?

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Jesus.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
How would that even work?

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Why am I even trying to justify a comment like that? What the hell?

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Only in our chat. chat.orangelandradio.com

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Here's what I have to say.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
More boobies!

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
More cock!

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.000
And not the animated porn star, by the way.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Michael Moorcock.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Oh, okay.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I saw it at the Lighthouse bookstore.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I was liking this more boobies tangent you were going down. Explain...

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:18.000
How should gamers incorporate boobies into the games?

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.000
I think that they should get those boob balls from realdoll.com

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:26.000
and just put them on top of their Xbox.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:32.000
And then when they feel aggression at their game, they hit pause and go play with some boobies.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Look, I don't think you want to make the boob usage juvenile.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I mean, which unfortunately, that's the kind of crap that ruins it for everybody,

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:43.000
is that when boobies in video games becomes more acceptable,

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
then you're gonna see more of that stuff like, you know,

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Boob Slapper 5000 on the Wii or something like that.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I'd buy that.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000
It's just garbage. You know, it's just absolute garbage.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
But you know, I think if...

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.000
But you know what, if I...

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Boobs is done tastefully.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
There's gonna be garbage on the Wii regardless.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
I'd rather see it all be adult garbage.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
You know what?

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000
If there were more party game collections that were all adult party games,

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
I think that we'd get a lot more purchases.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Well, the gaming industry is probably worried about the porn market.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
I mean, think about it.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:16.000
If that were to... Could that open up the floodgates to interactive porn on the Wii or the DS?

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Or I mean, not the...

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Not like there's not interactive porn on the PC already, Rob.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.000
I mean, we've got Red Light District and Second Life and...

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
If there is a way to put porn on something...

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Yeah, but Second Life doesn't count because it's furries.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.000
If there's a way to put porn on something, porn will be on something.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
People are obsessed with the Nookie.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000
They will... If they're not getting it in their real life, they will find some way of simulating it.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
It's just...

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000
And this is what I don't get why people are so repressed over everything.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
It's just that...

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Hi, humans, for the most part, are wired to fuck.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
End of story.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000
It is whether or not...

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.000
It's, you know, you want to procreate.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Whether or not you have an interest in whatever gender one has an interest in,

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000
or even what species one has an interest in,

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:17.000
human beings, for the most part, are wired to fuck.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
That is a genetic imperative.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.000
That is built into the DNA.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000
And while some people are not wired to fuck, and I, you know, fully...

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000
I mean, people... Fantastic.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Asexual, right?

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Some people are wired that way.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Most people are wired to fuck.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Including all of those repressed, right-wing, you know, Republican assholes

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:52.000
who want to, you know, or all of those, you know, religious right people, you know.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
How many of them have we heard of, you know?

02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Oh, having affairs with Playboy bunnies in the 80s, or, you know,

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.000
senators getting blowjobs in the bathroom, or, you know,

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:14.000
governors running off to Argentina to go get some Argentinian nookie.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:19.000
I'm looking at some of the stuff in the chatroom at chat.orangelandrejo.com.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Obviously, a text like... a chat like this is getting a big response.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Joshi16 says, Dark Sakura for President 2012.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000
More boobies, more cock.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Let's see, what else do we have here?

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Frisbee said, Kevin Smith said that he was going to put more cock in his films

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000
because one of his movies got an NC-17 at first.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
It is a little silly.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I mean, and think about it.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000
If you could put this type of stuff in our culture,

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
you could show people how to do it the safe way.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Like, imagine, like, if people did this, but they would stop and, you know,

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:54.000
put on a condom first, it might help, you know, put the image of safe sex out there.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Which is smart.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.000
It should all be handled like it was in, um, The Naked Gun,

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
where they had the full body condom.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Nice.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:13.000
But, but no, I mean, really, it is, it's, I think that it's just the whole,

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:19.000
there's, I mean, okay, it's like the little kid who knows something is bad

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
and he does it anyway because there's that risk involved.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
He's doing something naughty, you know.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.000
It's like, you know, wanting to go sneak out and buy, you know,

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.000
and smoke packed cigarettes even though it's really disgusting.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:38.000
You know, it's that same type of, you know, it's, it's something dangerous.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000
It's something, you know, not accepted, ooh.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Whereas you go to another country and it's like, so?

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Yay, boobs.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Let's bring it back to video games.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I'm sorry.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000
No, that's all right.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
No, but let's bring it back to video games and try to close out the topic.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Well, just my point is that there should be more boobs in video games.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Okay, fair enough.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
I can agree with you on that.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I think that the more boobs and more cock we have in video games,

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
the less people will freak out over it.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000
And be sexually repressed.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Yes.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
So.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000
People go get a vibrator.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
I'll do that right now.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
All right.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
So anyway, what better to follow up this story with

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
than our FUs of the Week segment, folks?

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
But we have something to, of course, inspire the angst this week,

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.000
and that would be this story about a child porn collector

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.000
who blamed games for fueling his obsession.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
This is a London man who said,

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
and I don't know why his name isn't out here,

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
that the London Free Press didn't run it,

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.000
apparently said he lived in a closed box of friendless fantasy

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.000
and it was fueled by video games, his computer, and comic books.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000
I'd work, come home, lock myself in the apartment.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
After a difficult childhood in foster care,

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
where he was separated from his siblings,

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.000
he became a truck driver who lived by himself in squalor and clinical depression.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:13.000
He was in a black hole, a strange sort of world his computer created.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Dude, I think your issues go far beyond what your computer made you do.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Your computers and video games don't control your actions.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
You, sir, control your actions.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.000
And, yeah, face palm, if I've ever heard that.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.000
So, yes, how about some angst dedicated towards this guy this week,

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
the FUs of the Week, Dar Sacher.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.000
FU to the stitch that got popped and the other stitch that regressed into my hand.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000
They're all coming out on Tuesday, but they hurt.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
It hurts a lot.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
So, fuck that.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Big ol' fuck you to Kimberly Block and also Jason K. Singleton.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000
You may not be familiar with them unless you live in the Sacramento area of California.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:06.000
They are two of shysters, basically, that are using the American Disability Act

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000
to file lawsuits against numerous businesses

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
causing them to basically settle with them to get money.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
I heard about this on the news.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Those are the people that also did that in Julian, right, out of San Diego?

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I don't know if they're the same people,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
but I heard about this, like 80 businesses got sued or something

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
and the people never even visited them.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Yes, and basically this is happening again.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
This woman filed four lawsuits.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Now you may be asking yourself, why the hell do I care about this?

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Because it comes back to hamburgers.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.000
And that's because they are forcing the Squeeze In,

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.000
which you may have seen them on the Food Network, a really small place.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:46.000
It serves a Squeeze of Cheese, which is a third-pound burger with a third pound of cheese on it.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
They're forcing them to move.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Basically, a very historic restaurant in the area

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000
and they have to move now because this dumb bitch

02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.000
doesn't realize that the Squeeze In is a historic building that can't possibly change

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
because it was built before they ever had these logs.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000
To be fair, I think they should be able to serve the handicapped.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Yes, but they can ring a bell or something.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
They do, and they're willing.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
And the problem is, though, she doesn't give a shit.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000
She probably has never been here, and the businesses that she sued are within,

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000
like there are two liquor stores nine miles away from where she lives.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Who the fuck would drive nine miles to a liquor store?

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I mean, this is Sacramento. There's a liquor store in every corner.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000
So it's obviously just for the money is all it's about.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000
And this guy in Eureka or whatever, the attorney that's doing it,

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:43.000
he has 164 lawsuits out there, all 88 cases.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Way to go. Thank you for closing a historic neighborhood or a historic restaurant.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I'm okay with these lawsuits.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
I'm not at all.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Hold on. I'm finished.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:00.000
If the business really is insensitive towards handicapped needs,

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
even if the person lives far away,

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.000
if the business really, truly is insensitive towards handicapped needs,

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000
but it sounds like these places, they will make it work.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Ring the bell, honk the horn.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.000
A lot of these places, it's not like they ignore handicapped folks.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.000
It's because they couldn't fit their wheelchair in the building.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:22.000
You can't fit in the building anyways if you're a normal human being,

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
let alone, you know, with a wheelchair.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
They have a deck outside, you know,

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
in case you don't want to squeeze into the building.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Should I sue because I'm diabetic and can't have the...

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Should I sue Baskin-Robbins because I'm diabetic and can't eat their ice cream?

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
They have no sugar added.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
You know what? You know the point I'm trying to get at.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Yes. Exactly.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
The whole thing is...

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.000
The Disability Act in and of itself is severely flawed.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:52.000
There are people who qualify for the Disability Act

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
who really are perfectly innate.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000
You know, for like, a handicapped parking package or something.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Who, now...

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Like, okay, I'm trying to remember what it is.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:07.000
It's like, if you have problems balancing your checkbook,

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000
you can actually qualify for a disabled parking.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Interesting.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I mean, it's really... The legislation on it is so flawed

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.000
that almost anyone can squeeze in and qualify for some sort of thing

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
under the Disabilities Act.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000
It needs to be modernized.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
It really does need to be completely revamped.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:33.000
I know people personally who definitely should have the placard.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Who definitely qualify for the benefits under these.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.000
There's people I know who should qualify and for some reason do not.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
And I think it's entirely unfair.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
You know, but like...

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
I think that there is...

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
You know, I put this in the same category...

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Oh god, I'm going to get political again.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
I'm just going to put this briefly again.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.000
I put this in the same category as welfare.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
There's a lot of room for abuse.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000
And if people can get a free ride, they will get a free ride.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I think that there needs to be more enabling services

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:11.000
instead of, you know, pandering services.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
And we'll leave it at that.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:17.000
I think it's so stupid.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Honestly, I think all of that should be thrown out as frivolous.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I think all of those should be thrown out as frivolous

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.000
unless she has a personal experience in those places.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
That where they refuse to help her.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Yeah.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Or accommodate her.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000
If the business wants your money, they will accommodate you.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Right.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
I don't really have a lot of big FUs in that last one

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
went on longer than any of us anticipated.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.000
I don't really have a lot this week.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:43.000
My only quick FU would go to my recent blood work results

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
because my doctor basically told me

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I'm getting fat and need to exercise more.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
That's great.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Just when I thought I was losing weight, I'm getting big again.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:56.000
So, FU to blood work and the truths that are revealed within.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Anyhow, let's get back to some more gaming news.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
We just have about three more stories for you guys.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
And then it's going to be time for you guys to call in

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:09.000
DarkSakura, do you have a story for us about a game?

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
I sure do.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Plants vs. Zombies is coming out on other platforms.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Right now it's only on PC and Mac,

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.000
but PopCap is talking about working on Xbox Live Arcade version,

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:27.000
I do believe, and possibly on iPhone.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
If there's a way they can work it in the World of Warcraft,

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I'm sure they will too.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Yeah.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
They're so crazy with their PopCap game.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:38.000
By the way, did you hear this week about the World of Warcraft Pagle game?

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Not just now the mod within World of Warcraft?

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Because it's very clear there is some PopCap employees

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.000
that are addicted to World of Warcraft

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:52.000
because you've noticed these little mutual jerk-off sessions

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:55.000
going on between the two companies is really what it is.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Because you've had PopCap put in the whole official Pagle mod,

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000
and I think they did a Bejeweled one too, inside World of Warcraft.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:08.000
And now this week, Blizzard allowed these WoW images

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:13.000
to go out in a standalone PC version of Pagle that has WoW-themed levels.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:16.000
So there definitely is some stroking going on between the two companies.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:21.000
I think there's Furious dry-humping.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
You know what though? They're all free, so we all win.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
So I'm not going to complain.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:28.000
They were all free expansions. It's brand awareness.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:33.000
And it gets all the stories covered on blogs and all that, so good for them.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Dry-humping?

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
I think these types of partnerships I'd like to see happen more often.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.000
I'd like to see more mutual masturbation going on in the gaming world.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I don't know about you guys.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Furious-humping?

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Exactly.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Well, a game that I don't think will have Furious-humping in it,

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Scribblenauts, has been rated by the ESRB.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:56.000
And as creative as the game is, their description of it is just as creative.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Of course, now the ESRB is required to have little synopsis of the games.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
And basically, here's what they put.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Scribblenauts, which is rated E10+.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:15.000
This is a puzzle game in which players navigate a series of traps, puzzles, and enemies

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.000
to collect stars scattered throughout the colorful levels.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Players have the ability to summon different objects by writing slash typing in the words,

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:27.000
example, bike, spaceship, lion, and watch it come to life.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:32.000
If multiple words are entered in a sequence, different whimsical scenarios can be triggered.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:35.000
A bicycle can be used to jump over a baby.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
A bulldozer can clear away a shark.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
A cabbage can be fed to a dinosaur.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Players can elect to summon cartoony versions of bats, bombs, guns, and flamethrowers.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000
These types of items can be used to destroy objects or even other summoned items.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.000
For example, a club can be used to hit an animal.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.000
A steak can be attached to a baby to attract lions.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.000
And rockets can be lobbed at a man.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:02.000
That in itself is so amazing. You can attach a steak to a baby to attract animals.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Love it.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Sweet.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:10.000
These triggered animations are minimally depicted and usually accompanied by a popping musical sound effect,

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000
bright stars, shapes, flashes, or small puffs of smoke.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:19.000
If a player wishes to, they may type the word in vomit, which causes a beige colored lump to appear on the screen.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:25.000
God, if this is not the game of the year, I don't know what is.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:29.000
I'm worried we've got a little much hype going on with this game caused by E3,

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:35.000
but we did have lulz at E3 playing this game. It was a lulz-y time.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I just hope it lasts. I hope it's not one of those games.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Because I'm worried it's one of those games that's going to be funny for 20 minutes and then you're done.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.000
You know what I mean?

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:48.000
So hopefully the game behind the game is still really good. We'll see.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I hope so.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Oh, and on top of that, of course, recognizing that this is going to be a success,

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:02.000
they would like to see Scribblenauts come to other platforms.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:09.000
We've never limited ourselves to the DS as a platform. In our heads, we'll see what the future holds.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Personally, we think that would be a hit on any platform, whether that platform would be an Xbox 360, PS3, or who knows.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:24.000
And that's coming from Marius Fallbush.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.000
I thought bad things.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Yeah, I bet you did after the booby story.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:35.000
I think, though, this game is going to inspire folks to trade whimsical answers to scenarios on the internet,

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000
like the most wacky fucking ways to beat levels that you've ever heard of.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
I think that could be interesting.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
It also has level swapping and custom levels.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Oh, I didn't know that. That's pretty cool.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
We'll see what happens.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I wonder if there's going to be one foolproof way to beat every level, though.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.000
There's going to be different ways to beat levels, and it's almost like golf.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:04.000
You have pars in the game, where you're trying to beat the level with x number of objects spawned, that type of thing.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Well, I still remember, even in the free mode that we were messing around with,

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:14.000
there was a meter as to how many objects you could have at one time, so I could see them doing things with that meter.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Joshi16 in our chatroom, chat.orangelandradio.com, says,

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
I want it on the PC Mac, and DarkTetsuya says,

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Yeah, I look forward to the game facts entries on it.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.000
I wonder if you can summon dirty words, or if the game just scolds you for trying to put them in.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
No, it just won't recognize them.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:33.000
What if you put in feces? Will it not even recognize that?

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.000
I don't know. It may do poop.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
You could do vomit. Why can't you do poo?

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I bet any poop would be in there.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
We should have Poop Rocket.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I don't think that's in the dictionary.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Or like Poop Flinging Monkey.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Alright, we'll see.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Tigerclaw brings up a good point.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Penis is not even a dirty word. It's a scientific word.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000
It's still not in the game.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
DarkTetsuya says, So no cocks?

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.000
I think you should be able to put in cock, and a little rooster shows up.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Put in fag, and a cigarette shows up. Why not?

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Just do the literal meaning.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I don't know.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:14.000
We'll see more when this game comes out. I'm sure people are going to try every combination they can think of and find more easter eggs.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Because if the lolcats are in it, like long cat, you know, and uh, ceiling cat, and oh really owl.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.000
If all those things are in it, they're probably still adding lol's to it.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Probably going through every internet meme they can find.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Giant enemy crabs are in the game.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Are they really?

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Nice.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Alright anyhow, do you remember we talked a while, I'm sure at length about this on the show before about the whole Wii's new demo play feature?

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.000
This is where you'd be able to pause the game and just skip scenes like it was a DVD.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Or get walked through certain scenarios in the game.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Well guess what?

02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:03.000
This week it was announced that through a blurb in Nikkei newspaper in Japan, the feature will be used in portable games as well.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
That means it's coming to the DS.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Sorry, the newspaper referred to it as skip functionality, a skip feature if you will.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000
It's also supposed to be used for high speed action games.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Interesting.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:23.000
So, who knows what this could bring for DS games in the future, but this does seem to be the future of Nintendo.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
The future of gaming?

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Well I guess that's all in how the general public responds to it.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
We'll see.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
That's that for demo play.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Alright, let's open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:44.000
But do keep in mind if you are going to use Skype to call us, please make sure you test your connection first to ECHO123.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.000
So again that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Do we have some last minute stories we want to get into while we wait for some calls?

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Because there's a little bit of a delay between us and when they hear us on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Oh, never mind, we're getting a call right now. I lied.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
This is Lee Shem.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Hi Lee Shem, what's up?

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Um, not much.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Um, I just called in to talk about BlazBlue.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Oooh, BlazBlue!

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:16.000
You know, I've heard Bobby talk a lot about this game, but I have not picked it up myself yet, so I don't have a lot to say.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
So dude, please tell us about BlazBlue.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Well, BlazBlue is a fighting name that's supposed to be the spiritual successor to Guilty Gear.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Um, I think the total is 12 characters that you get to play as.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:37.000
So we got a smaller roster list, but they're pretty balanced actually.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:44.000
And the game is, well I think of it as an easier Guilty Gear actually.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Um, the button layout is just four buttons.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Um, you got light, medium, strong, and then a button you use to do cool shit.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Are you a big fighting game fan? Like, do you play a lot of the fighters that come out?

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Oh yeah, I'm actually looking forward to Mall vs. Capcom 2 coming out at the end of the month, and King of Fighters 12.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Okay, so I just wanted to kind of gauge your, like, experience and love for a fighting game before I ask this next question, and that would be how does BlazBlue, in your opinion, stack up to other fighting games?

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:33.000
It's slower Guilty Gear, I guess, but um...

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:48.000
My opinion is pretty, it's faster than Street Fighter IV. Um, I just, it's a really cool, um, it's just a really cool fighting game.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Well, here's one more question I have for you, and that is, you know, with all these 2D fighting games that we're starting to see on Xbox Live Marketplace,

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:05.000
for instance, we've had, what, we've had King of Fighters 98, we've had Guru, Mark of the Wolves, we've had, uh, um, some of these old classic fighting games coming out,

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:10.000
and then, uh, I'm trying to think, what else, there's one coming up in the future, oh, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is coming up in the future.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.000
King of Fighters 12?

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.000
And all, yeah, all these games, especially the Neo Geo ones, are coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:25.000
When you can get these games for 10, 15 dollars a pop, does that make 60 dollars or 50 dollars, whatever BlazBlue costs, worth it in comparison?

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Well, when you look at the online, some of those games, like, I have Guru, Mark of the Wolves, but, from the times I played, um, online was total trash, actually.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Um, but, in BlazBlue, it's, you know, you're getting a high definition fighter, a complete story mode, um, and the story mode, um, some of the characters are, like, really interesting.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:06.000
And, you know, you follow their paths, and even, like, characters, like, you know, they had me, um, saying, wow, fighting games have this good a story.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Like, sometimes I was actually laughing my ass off at some characters' wackiness, sometimes, you know, I was feeling bad for a character because, you know, I personally think that they're pathetic, and, you know,

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.000
but, you know, they just keep fighting.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Very interesting, and, you know, I've heard that's one of the stronger points about BlazBlue is that it does have more of a unique story than you usually see in fighting games, which is just, usually, the story is kind of just crafted to make the fighting make some sensical,

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:42.000
make some sense out of it, whereas it seems like BlazBlue, they actually put some thought into the story, so, interesting.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Uh, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:31:45.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Um, um, I just got a PS3, and I just wanted to say it's awesome so far, and at Best Buy, I don't know if they're doing this for all of them, but they have Valkyria Chronicles on clearance for only $15.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:04.000
It's a great pickup, and, you know, very cheap.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Dude, I actually want to get that game. Where did you see that for clearance at?

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Um, at their Best Buy over here in San Antonio.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Hmm, I might have to try and find that here locally. Awesome.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Well, and one other quick question for you. Why now? I'm always kind of curious. I asked, you know, when people plunk down $300, $400 for a new console, I always want to ask this.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Why now? What made you decide to take the plunge now?

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Two things. One, they had this bundle going on with the Killzone 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:44.000
I wanted to pick that up because, you know, I think for $400, that kind of justifies it, because in the next month, we're supposed to be getting a price cut.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:49.000
So, those two extra games, I don't know, they kind of seem to me to even it out.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:57.000
And plus, next month, in August, there's supposed to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Blu-ray box set that I really want to pick up.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:03.000
All right. Okay. Well, thank you very much for your thoughts and opinions tonight, and have fun with your PlayStation 3, all right?

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
All right. Thank you very much.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:09.000
You're welcome. And LittleBigPlanet. It's awesome. Seriously. Later.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:15.000
All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:20.000
I'll let... Oh, it's ringing again. You might not be able to do last-minute stories tonight.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
It's GS68.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind?

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:33.000
I'm going to get back from Galactica 3, which I'm guessing Dark Soccer was unable to go to this year.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Yeah. You know, Dark Soccer had the issues with her hands, so if she went, she wouldn't really be able to play the video games because of her hand.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:46.000
I know. Bummer, right? And then I was going to go, but I had a conflict with the Rocky Reno show I'm doing.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:51.000
I had a rehearsal this weekend, and it sucked because I was in the bay. I wasn't that far away.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:56.000
It would have only taken me like 30 minutes to get there, but by the time we were done, California Extreme would have been done.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:57.000
So it just didn't...

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
It went on until 2 a.m.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Oh, did it really? Shut up. I thought it was done at like 9 o'clock.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Ah, oh well. It doesn't matter. I wouldn't have gotten my money's worth, but I know we keep saying we're going to go every year, and then just some damn thing happens.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.000
It's just the worst time of year. The summer is so, so busy.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.000
But you went. How did you enjoy yourself?

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:28.000
It was alright. It felt like a little less games this year. I'm not sure because it's only my second year going.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Well, what kind of games did you get a chance to play? By the way, for those that have never been to California Extreme before, it's basically just a bunch of old school arcade games in a convention center.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.000
You pay some money to get in. Have fun. That's basically what it is. It's a traveling arcade.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Most of the older games with a few 90s, 2000s games thrown in. I didn't feel high school wasn't finished, but I couldn't get on the top 10, so fuck that.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Nice. I'm looking at your photo gallery. Wait, I'm looking at your photo gallery you posted in chat, and I see that you're playing that old hologram game from Sega, the Time Traveler. That's awesome. That game was such garbage.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Yeah, I saw it. I probably got a chance to play it because when I was a kid, I'd see it until all the time, but it never really interested me.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Plus, if I remember right, when I was younger, it was really expensive to play. That's pretty cool. You have an actual punch out arcade machine. Nice. Man, it looks like you guys had a lot of fun.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I got on a plane, caught in a gang, and if you played point blank and advanced, you'd play the final piece of advanced mode. But I'll play it in the same mode.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Were there a lot of...

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000
I'm sorry, go ahead.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Well, I guess you have to use the curtain, you know, coming down, turn it to the energy cube, then you have to shoot them to keep them away. I'd rather be picking energy cube you lose.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Hmm.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:05.000
This has been an NPR game for a long time. I love that game.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I see... go ahead, sorry.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:17.000
And then I thought Pachinko Machine, which is really cool, but I never got to play because by the time I thought about playing it, it was gone. They are already packing it up.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Aw, bummer. I see an actual Moonwalker machine here, too. That's pretty cool.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:29.000
It's kind of surreal seeing any of that, especially considering the man died a few weeks ago.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Well, you know, the machines were made. They're out there. But yeah, I get what you're saying. It's kind of interesting to see that out in the wild right now with all the stuff in the media.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Well, what would you say is your favorite thing that you played at the show out of everything?

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:47.000
Once I was in Thailand, I was playing Rush 2049 because it had an 8-player setup.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Wow, nice. Getting to play it the way it's intended with all 8 people. Nice.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Yeah.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Was there any garbage that you played where you were like, man, they should have just left this at home?

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:11.000
There's a number of games that I played and didn't really recall enjoying for too long.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Let's see.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I came from a pretty interesting game called Chiller. It's like a game with one of those mouse and gun things.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:25.000
And you have to shoot monsters to go on from one stage to the next.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:34.000
But sometimes the things you shoot are corpses, like naked corpses and like in-portrait chambers and such.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000
What?

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:36.000
So it's like very weird.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.000
That does sound very weird. But okay, whatever makes you happy, I guess.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Well, it sounds like you had a good time at the show and I swear we're really going to try and make it next year.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
It just depends on the personal schedules and everything.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Hopefully.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Hopefully the surgeries or nothing like that.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.000
But any other comments about the show or for our listeners tonight?

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:59.000
No, not really. I was going to get a bonus involving my pictures.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
All right, well.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
I'll be posting them later.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:08.000
What, the picture you just posted here in chat? Hold on, I'm going to show, take a look here.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.000
The pictures I've been posting, well, that's one of them on YouTube.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Gotcha. Well, then check out the gallery. It looks like you've got a little gallery going on Photobucket and plugging it in our chatroom.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.000
So there you go.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.000
All right, OTS68, glad to hear you had fun and we'll hopefully see you next year.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
All right. See you.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Later, dude.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.000
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We've got calls coming in back to back tonight.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
That's Legend of Zaku.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
No, Legend of Zaku. What's on your mind?

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Nothing much. Just getting through another weekend.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Just chilling back in New York City, trying to do the usual routines.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:52.000
But yeah, just looking over what's been happening so far.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:39:00.000
And then all of a sudden I see this little gem of a story right here regarding Battlefield 1943,

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:10.000
where apparently it says something about at least 5 million dying in the first day of multiplayer.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:17.000
And then they go as far as saying that they're trying to get up to 48 million kills.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:21.000
And I don't know, I hear Kotaku basically making a fit about it.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
The fact that it's tasteless.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:33.000
The fact that they're playing a World War II game and trying to rack up kills to match the amount in real life.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Yeah, I mean, comparing it to the real life is a little bit tacky, especially when video games are supposed to be separated from real life.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:48.000
And a lot of times the justification for these games to be so violent is, well, it's not real life.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
You know what I mean?

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:59.000
I mean, I can understand people's rationale regarding something being tasteless, but it's just a game.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.000
I mean, what happened already happened.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Right, I mean, I'm okay with the game, but the little promotion is a little tacky.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Besides that, basically staying on the subject of tastelessness, another one where they have a flash game I believe that recreates Flight 1549, the one that landed on the Hudson earlier this year.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:38.000
And so they're basically saying, I don't know, it's just on the same subject of being tasteless, though.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Well, yeah, I guess, but at the same time, isn't there someone in the world who's created an art piece out of that?

02:40:49.000 --> 02:41:08.000
I mean, I remember Super Combine Massacre RPG getting a lot of flack, especially the whole slam dance thing which pretty much blew up in their face with the fact that they supposedly got censored for that game.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:20.000
And then you see how tastelessness basically goes to the extreme in that sense, where you get censored in a festival that goes against the principles.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:29.000
You know, I guess a lot of it just has to kind of do with your interpretation of it, and that goes with games, that goes with art in general.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:36.000
If you want to be offended by it, you will, but if you want to allow yourself to be offended by it, you won't.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:37.000
I don't know if that makes sense.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:42.000
As usual in the world, not everybody can be pleased, apparently.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:46.000
No, sir. Well, anything else on your mind this week, Zaku?

02:41:46.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Besides DDRX still sucking and just waiting to hopefully, you know, if my local arcade Chinatown Fair apparently follows through on what they said they were about replacing every machine with DDRX, then I'll probably see how bad it is, but it's been pretty much dull on that end.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Well, we actually got to ask Konami this week when DDR was going to be fun again, and the response was, wait, please.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Wait, please. Do they refer to the arcade version or the home version?

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Wait, please.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Yeah, you ought to love those blanket answers, trying to cover their own ass.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Take care, Zaku. Thanks for being on the show. Later.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Alright.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Do you think he knows that was a reference to his story earlier tonight?

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:39.000
I don't know. Alright, 1877 Game OLR.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.000
We'll take like one more call, and then we're going to wrap up for the night.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Again, that's 877 Game OLR.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Here comes a call.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Hi, this is Spazinator here.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind tonight?

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Two things. First off, I just want to agree with what you were saying earlier.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Yeah, it seems like a lot of people out there, especially in America, have things half-assed backwards.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:22.000
No, you know, whether it be movies or games or whatever, you see people all losing limbs,

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:25.000
being decapitated, brutally murdered.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:31.000
But God forbid they show a boob, oh my God, they should go to DEFCON 3.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Well, to be fair, there's a lot of people that don't like the violence either,

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000
but yeah, it does seem strange in our culture that, you know,

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.000
and I kind of blame the MPAA at the end of the day,

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:47.000
because they're the ones that put the more stringent NC-17 ratings on things that are slightly sexual,

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000
whereas, you know, you can have all these violent movies rated R.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
I think it needs to go one way or the other.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Either we need to get some more fucking tits in an R-rated movie,

02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:00.000
or, and that was fuck and tits, not some fucking tits, although, you know, you can get those too,

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:07.000
but we need that in an R-rated movie, or we need these extremely violent movies to be rated NC-17.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Give them the kiss of death rating as well.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:13.000
I think you need to go one way or the other. It's just, it's getting ridiculous.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Yeah, well, the thing is, you know, not to get all, like, political and whatnot,

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:24.000
but, plus, I don't totally remember my history lessons,

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:32.000
but I think, at least in part, you know, the country was founded by, like, ultra, ultra, like,

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:42.000
conservative, like, Puritans, like, you know, like the Pilgrims, you know, wearing the buckles on their shoes and whatnot.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Yeah, exactly, and, you know, they were, you know, they were, if I remember my history,

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:58.000
you know, they even, they played illegal, you know, because they considered that a form of lying,

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:04.000
and, you know, they considered anything involving the body dirty and wrong and all that.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Unfortunately, we really haven't gone beyond that.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Well, you know what, here's the good news. The good news is that, you know, porn is not illegal.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:18.000
A lot of this stuff is not illegal, like, you know, in the old days, this was, like, you know, again,

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:23.000
like, kind of, Dark Soccer was giving the story earlier that if you said fuck, you could get, you know,

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:28.000
beat up for saying that, basically. Like, we live in a day and age where at least this shit isn't illegal,

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:35.000
and, like, I can sit here on the internet and say fuck, shit, cock, piss, boobs, I can say all of that, you know,

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:40.000
and that's a great thing about freedom of speech, which, sadly, not everyone in this world has.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:47.000
But the thing is that we have these governing bodies that put labels on things that are broken and need to be modernized.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:54.000
And the greatest, I mean, the biggest opinion I always use is, or I should say example I always use,

02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:00.000
is a movie that came out in 1997, 1998, one of my favorite movies ever. It's called Romeo and Michelle's High School Reunion.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:06.000
It's an innocent movie with Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino about these chicks that go to their 10-year high school reunion,

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:09.000
and there's a couple sex jokes and they say the word fuck a few times.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:16.000
The movie is rated R. And why? Why is a movie like that rated R? It's practically cartoony in nature.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:22.000
I would let a 13, 14-year-old watch this movie, no problem. Any kid that's old enough to know about sex,

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:29.000
I would much rather have them watching this movie on repeat, you know, every day for a summer than watching The Terminator.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:38.000
I really would. You know, it's just, we just, some of these things we have in our culture really need to be modernized. That's all.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Yeah, I agree with you. I think even you mentioned this time and time before.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Now, real games have really been around for what, 35, 40 years, where movies have been around since early 1900s.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:08.000
You know, there's, you know, people, even my grandparents at age have been going out watching movies,

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:15.000
whereas, you know, real games have always been, what, our generation, you know, and younger kids,

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:24.000
and there's that kind of disconnect where, you know, the older generations think of real games as these kind of toys,

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:34.000
toys for kids, if something is cursing or violence or squaring it, oh my God, no, this is going to be the worst thing ever.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:37.000
It's going to be a downfall of Western civilization.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:43.000
Bazinator, you do make an interesting comparison that when movies were first came out, there was a lot you still couldn't show in movies, either.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:46.000
You know, there was a lot of things that were really taboo to show in movies.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:54.000
You go back and, you know, the first boobies didn't show up in a movie until probably the 50s?

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000
And don't even quote me on that.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Earlier than that.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Well, I don't plan to profess to be a cinema expert, but, you know, it was very taboo.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Even if the boobies showed up, it was extremely taboo, just like, you know, seeing a blowjob in a movie is day and age.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Video games, I think, just have a way to go.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:11.000
But we need to wrap up.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Bazinator, did you have anything else you wanted to share with us?

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Well, I just want to add one more point.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Sure.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Conversely, you know, even though boobs are relatively new, you know, there's movies out there that, you know, a century ago weren't acceptable.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:30.000
They're not acceptable now, like Fourth Over Nation.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
It came out in 1915.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
It was a KKK movie.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
They're eating a chance at hell.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Good point.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.000
There's society taboos that we have overcome.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:50.000
So that's true. You've seen, in some ways, progression where, you know, some of those things that really were inappropriate to show in film have just kind of evolved.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
At least that's, you know, how we feel about it now.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
And, you know, rightfully so.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Some of the stuff that was very controversial in those movies.

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Society kind of evolves.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.000
But it just seems like with video games, it's evolving slower, and I don't get that.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
But, Bazinator, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:06.000
We appreciate it.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Have a good one, buddy, okay?

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Yep, you too.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Okay, later.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Alright, we're going to go ahead and wrap up the phone calls tonight, because we want to kind of wrap up the show and get on out of here for the night.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:19.000
But poor Loki's been waiting to do some last-minute stories, and he can take it off by phone calls.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Well, do you have any...

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
You're looking into getting that machine shipped, aren't you?

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
I saw you looking at a shipping website.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.000
It's actually not a thousand dollars.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
It hasn't reached its...

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
It hasn't reached its minimum.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:38.000
I'm just looking to see how much it would actually cost to do something like that, because DDR machines are not available anywhere.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:43.000
Unless you're in, like, Korea, and God knows how much it's going to cost to ship from Korea.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Right.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Well, do you have any last-minute stories for us before we wrap up tonight?

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Yes, sure, of course.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Well, strangely enough, and out of nowhere, and probably going to have the same impact on piracy,

02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:00.000
MCDoubledefDP has returned.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:03.000
You may not remember him by name, but you'll remember him by song.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:11.000
He had his wonderful online hit of Don't Copy That Floppy, which did absolutely nothing to stop piracy,

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:17.000
but now he's back with his Don't Copy That Too, and apparently...

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Really? I thought that shit was from the 80s.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:25.000
Seriously, he's from the 80s, and basically, based on the little video teaser he has,

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:32.000
it looks like if you copy stuff off the internet, well, your parents will be dragged out in the street and beaten to death.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Sounds pretty accurate to me.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.000
But, uh, yes, awesome.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Hold on, I gotta look at this here. Hold on.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
We have a little preview here.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Let's see if I can fast-forward.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Oh, this is like a preview or something.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
No, no, no, no, they go through the song.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Just give me a second.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
I gotta fast-forward then, I guess.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:08.000
No, it's right here.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:09.000
Wow.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Fucking joke.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Interesting.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:15.000
You missed the beginning part of it, it doesn't just sound like that.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Ah, whatever.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Yeah, okay.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Some dude who's gonna get a lot of hits on his YouTube, congrats.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Yeah.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Konami is once again innovated on crap.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:29.000
Apparently now they have a brand new game.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:34.000
The only thing going for it is that it has 120 music tracks in it.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:38.000
And including apparently some Bomani songs, I'm not sure.

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:41.000
But the game is called Walk It Out.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Yes, Konami has created a game for the Wii that is about walking outdoors.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Nice.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Yeah.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
Seriously?

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
Really?

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Walking outdoors?

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:00.000
But apparently it is a rhythm game, so you know, you have to step to the beat.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:01.000
So there is a game in it.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:05.000
There is a game to it, but it's walking outdoors.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Come on.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Really?

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
I do that for school credit.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
You play the game, going to buy the game.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
I mean, ugh.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:15.000
Anyways.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
On my YouTube project this week, we went outdoors.

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:20.000
It was a lot of fun, actually.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Myst will be coming to the Playstation Network for PSP July 16th.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:29.000
And that's kind of neat.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Apparently there's a new MechWarrior game coming out.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:39.000
They announced after a few little teases that MechWarrior 5, well technically MechWarrior 5,

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:44.000
but it's now going to be called MechWarrior, will be coming out from Smith & Tinker,

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:52.000
which is actually founded by FASA co-founder Jordan Weisman and Piranha Games.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:56.000
And apparently it's going to be coming out on PC and Xbox 360.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:02.000
And we'll have a single player campaign as well as a four player co-op campaign.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:03.000
That's awesome.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:04.000
Nice.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
We'll have a $200 controller too.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:07.000
That's optional.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:08.000
Remember that.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:09.000
They never had that for...

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.000
That was something else.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.000
But that was a mech game, wasn't it?

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
It was a mech game, but it's not this mech game.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
I know it's not that mech game, but it was some other game.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Also, Smith & Tinker has authorized MechTech to distribute MechWarrior 4,

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:25.000
along with its expansions, for free, on the internet.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
Thank you, Chatters, GS68, Steel Battalion.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
That was the game I was trying to think of.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
On the internet.

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:36.000
So you'll actually be able to play MechWarrior 4 for free on BattleTech.com soon enough.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:39.000
You know what we need in this world?

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
Real mechs.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:42.000
That's what we need.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:46.000
How much would you pay to go to a place that was like an arena

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
where nobody would really get hurt or really get blown up?

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
It would be like laser tag, all right?

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:53.000
But you would have real mechs that you would crawl into and get in.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
You mean robot jocks?

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:58.000
Something like that, where you would actually crawl in these giant machines.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
And I'm not talking about the shit of Dave & Busters.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:03.000
You would actually walk around a giant arena outside

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:07.000
with bales of hay, obstacles, and stuff like that,

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
and go around and shoot people.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
No, I'm talking about a real fucking mech.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:14.000
That would be fucking hot shit right there.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
I would pay lots of money to do that.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:17.000
And so would you.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Yes, but can you imagine if they maintained them

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:23.000
like they do arcade games that are in some of these family fun centers?

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:26.000
My mech's missing my leg. I can't turn.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:27.000
I'm running in circles.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
I can't do it, Captain. I don't have the power.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:32.000
I can't fire. I've fallen over.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Jason in chat says they have real mechs.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:39.000
There was a real Gundam in Japan, life size.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Yeah, they actually do have one, and they were also working on...

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:48.000
They did a Gigantor in another town.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
The Gundam was outside Tokyo.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.000
The mere thought gives me a semi.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Carcassonne's coming to DS.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
That's kind of neat.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:00.000
That game's fun.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:07.000
Really, it needs to be some other game.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
Oh, great. I totally forgot the name of the game.

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:10.000
The other?

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
The other game that's similar to this game

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:16.000
that's also another board game turned Xbox Live arcade game

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
that I can't remember, but I played a lot of

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:21.000
and played a lot of the board game, and just...

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Ah!

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
What was the other one? I can't even remember, too.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
There was Carcassonne, and there was...

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
God, there was all the expansions for it, too.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Somebody in chat will yell it out.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Catan, Settlers of Catan. Thank you.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Thank you. That's what needs to be on there.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:38.000
And I need memory in my brain.

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Also, the PlayStation Network will be getting manga as well.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
They're actually going to get some downloadable comics.

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:48.000
Of course, this has only been announced for the Japanese markets,

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
but why not? Why not put it over here?

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
You know what? Neat idea.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
I actually think that's a neat idea.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
It's a little weird, but why not?

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
We have these Amazon e-reader books.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Why not manga on your PSP? Why not?

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Didn't we see some of this, actually?

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
I thought there were some games that came out,

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
not that long ago, that were kind of like this,

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.000
like $20 comic books on the PSP.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
Yeah, you're talking about the Metal Gear Solid motion comics.

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:13.000
Yeah, remember that?

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:14.000
Yeah.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
Yeah, I mean, why not?

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:22.000
There's a brand new mod for Half-Life 2, Neo Tokyo,

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.000
which is actually, I believe, like a Tolkien version of the game.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:32.000
It's been released for the Source software development kit,

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:35.000
and I think it will be available on Steam.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:41.000
It's actually been in the works for five years now,

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:46.000
and kind of is inspired by Ghost in the Shell, Akira, that type of stuff,

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
but it's an all multiplayer game,

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.000
and the trailer for it is friggin' awesome,

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
so definitely worth checking out.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
You can actually download it on their client page,

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:58.000
neotokiohq.com.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:01.000
Check it out there. It looks pretty sweet.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Also, I think a while back we saw there was a graffiti type device

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.000
created using the Wii Remote,

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:16.000
sort of using similar things as the John Cho stuff,

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:20.000
where he created the virtual light boards.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Well, now you have the interactive white board thing

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.000
using a Wii spray can,

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:33.000
and actually apparently won a design prize in Germany,

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
which is pretty cool.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:39.000
Held by the German firm International Forum Design,

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:45.000
Wii Spray was one of the 377 finalists of the prestigious award.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:51.000
That's a lot of finalists, but okay.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:57.000
And then finally, Medal of Honor Heroes

02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:01.000
is the latest game on the PSP to be exploited

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:05.000
to enable custom firmware in homebrew,

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:08.000
and yes, this also works.

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Actually, they've tested it on the PSP-1000.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:13.000
I think it also works on the 3000,

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:16.000
but once again, going back to the beginning of this show

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:20.000
and discussion about countermeasures for piracy

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.000
and that type of thing, no matter how hard you try,

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
there's someone always trying harder.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:28.000
And that goes for both sides.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
All right, a little lesson learned on tonight's show.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:31.000
There you go.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.000
The more you know.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Yes, indeed, the more you know.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:38.000
All right, well, I guess that's going to wrap it up for tonight's show,

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
and before we say good night, though,

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
So Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
as you enjoy The Sims 3 for the rest of the evening?

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
I'm spray painting sand.

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:49.000
That's that noise I hear.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Yes.

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:51.000
What color are you spraying sand?

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:54.000
I'm actually turning the ground into sand.

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:57.000
I'm using the terrain paint.

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
My final thought is I'm actually kind of craving Del Taco,

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:02.000
and I'm hoping the one in Rockland is open late.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:06.000
So I'm driving out there tonight, so I want Del Taco.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:07.000
Mmm, Del Taco.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:10.000
Loki, your final thought?

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:14.000
My final thought is I need to play more games this week,

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
but in the absence of playing games,

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:19.000
I've been unpacking, and I'm almost done.

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:20.000
All righty.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
Hey, thank you guys so much for downloading our show

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:25.000
and tuning in to us and supporting independent broadcasting.

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
It's because of you guys that our show is so successful

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
and we have the motivation to be here every week.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
All we ask if you enjoy the show,

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
tell two people you know about the show.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
Help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Radio?

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:37.000
Radio.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
Leave us nice reviews on websites as well.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:40.000
That always goes a long way,

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
especially when there's asshats out there that leave reviews on the show

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
that clearly haven't even listened to it.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:47.000
Nothing will piss you off like that.

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:50.000
iTunes, you need to let us review reviewers.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:51.000
We demand it.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:54.000
Anyhow, that's going to do it for another week here on Orange Launch Radio.

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Thank you guys so much.

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
Once again, we'll see you next week.

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
We'll be back for more video game news and your voices.

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Send us emails. Send us tweets.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:03.000
Let's hear your voice.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:04.000
See you guys.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:07.000
