13715	15478	Tonight, July 5th, 2009.
16199	18984	What happened to some games that disappeared from Xbox Live?
19365	22450	Details emerge on Last.fm connectivity with the Xbox.
22931	25676	Could PS2 emulation be coming back to the PlayStation 3?
32017	32637	Hello, everybody.
54963	56843	DarkSakura, the happiest bunny on the farm
73249	81773	and I'm sure they're having fun being big giggling girls and no, I always tease them about that but I know they're having a good time nerding it up, I'm sure.
82374	85796	If there was a Star Trek experience, I'm sure they'd be there right now but sadly it's closed.
86336	87937	I thought they reopened it.
88397	91558	I think they're going to reopen it soon but it's not open yet.
91599	96921	Especially, you know, the worst time to close it right before the movie comes out and it's like, ah, missed potential.
97281	98022	Bummer, whoops.
98502	101724	Well, we still have you guys in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
102064	104025	I wonder if DarkSakura might be listening.
104265	106006	I think her and Tiara are just kind of hanging out tonight.
106026	107086	They're just kind of away.
107506	110548	So if so, I expect angry text messages.
110848	111908	They shouldn't be listening.
111928	114209	They should be gambling and seeing shows.
115450	116510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
135896	136677	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
157373	160717	I didn't buy fireworks because in California the fireworks all suck here.
161639	165263	They're getting more safe and sane as the time goes on.
165364	169509	So you buy $100 worth of fireworks and they last you like five minutes because...
170958	192007	and so being smart and just plain lazy and broke this year decided, you know, I'm just not going to buy fireworks so we decided to go down to our local mall that was doing a fireworks show and so we went and kind of sat on my sister's apartment lawn and watched them from there.
193035	194916	So that was alright, you know, it's like, whatever.
195616	199977	Which is funny, because Loki and I were at the same show last night, except I was in the actual mall parking lot.
200678	201138	Which is funny.
201838	203799	This is the unplanned, we were at the same place.
204239	207140	Yeah, so... Took us an hour to get out of that goddamn lot.
207300	208520	Three minutes, for us.
208600	209080	You suck.
209521	210981	Well, we were far enough away.
211961	216383	Um, so... Yeah, that's what we basically did, and it was okay, I mean, it's just...
217782	218622	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
238668	244871	And actually this year, the night before, because they do the rodeo for three days or so.
244951	246672	So they do the Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
248172	249953	Or maybe this year is Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
250393	253975	Anyways, so they had fireworks each night.
254595	257917	And unfortunately the second night, apparently there was an accident.
258157	262178	And one of the mortars shot off into the crowd, burning people.
262399	265280	So, sad I missed that.
265680	266640	So, oh well.
267261	267741	But, um...
269383	274085	I hope it isn't like Final Destination where you had a premonition to not go.
274485	285611	No, by premonition meaning that the rodeo sucked every year, then yeah, I guess... Well, we normally don't actually go into the rodeo, we just watch it from outside, but...
287826	292271	They started figuring out that people are doing that, so they keep shooting the fireworks even lower.
292652	299661	I mean, that's dangerous enough, but because they go, Hey, you've got to come in the rodeo to see the fireworks.
299681	301423	We're going to shoot them 10 feet above everybody.
301663	302584	It's like, come on.
303405	304647	But, oh well.
305844	326089	reading our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com looking at some of the commentary, Tiger Claw suggesting we need someone to make OLR fireworks fireworks that explode into the OLR logo hey, I'd be down for that, except they're probably very expensive I love it, DarkTentCia says why can't they play America, fuck yeah, during a show I said the exact same thing so did I I said the exact same thing last night were you listening to the whole simulcast they did on One Direction?
326109	332971	yes, that was crap and they're playing, you know, God bless the USA and all the patriotic stuff I was like, they need to just bust out with America, fuck yeah
334923	335623	America, fuck yeah, pop pop
355387	358408	and just the biggest fire you could possibly imagine.
359068	365351	Well, since I like fire a lot, not only did I see the fireworks... By the way, a happy 4th of July to all the other American folks that listen to our program.
365911	368552	If you're not American, well, I hope you had a good weekend, nonetheless.
369833	374114	Happy Canada Day to those of our friends in Canada, because that was just this past week as well, three days before ours.
374255	375395	Exactly, and you know what?
375555	378536	It's not really... I mean, a lot of people, I guess, celebrate independence.
378716	380897	I just celebrate the fact they get the light stuff on fire.
380937	381337	Exactly.
381738	382858	That's all I really celebrate.
383278	386542	And I think that's something that the whole world can celebrate.
386622	390025	Okay, some of those safe and sane fireworks, though, are a little crazy, okay?
390365	392768	Because, like, okay, we really like fire.
392828	396992	So not only did we go to the public fireworks show, but then we came back and lit off some of our private stash.
397513	398414	And you know Victoria.
398474	402297	Victoria was there, and she had brought her 11-year-old brother, like stepbrother or something, came...
402958	403679	Thanks for watching!
418942	419923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
440166	441967	It's Super Scope 6 of fireworks.
442247	444629	You have to literally put it on your shoulder.
444829	448031	I thought it was going to be a pathetic little display like a sparkler or something.
448431	451933	No, this thing was a... It didn't last very long.
451953	453314	It was only about 30 seconds.
453614	460438	But it shot off monsters of color and sparks so much that the kid got afraid and started backing up a little bit.
460938	463319	And we were all actually kind of like, this can't be good.
463339	465161	But he was scared to hold it and all this stuff.
465181	466421	And Victoria was just like...
467802	468723	You fucking bought it!
468943	472165	You fucking hold it!
472665	473586	This is great.
474026	475107	So, you know, teaching them young.
475787	477828	So, yeah, and it was cool.
477868	481571	We set it off, and it was very amusing, at least for those 30 seconds.
482031	490136	The other thing we did during Fourth of July is we were watching Comedy Central all day, where they had a marathon of, like, stand-up comedy, which is awesome.
490676	492277	So there's a bunch of comedians in there.
492297	494378	I'm like, oh, yeah, that's that guy that I wanted to see.
494398	496680	So that was pretty much it.
496700	496840	Yeah.
497682	501663	We don't have any, unfortunately at Tiger Cloud we don't have cool things like roaming candles here.
501703	503363	Yeah, he's asking if I'm talking about roaming candles.
503424	505604	No, you don't point, this wasn't something you point upwards.
505644	509385	You hold it like a bazooka or a Super Scope 6 and it shoots sideways.
509705	514306	But what's shooting out looks like the type of thing you would see in a normal safe and sane firework.
514366	520228	I don't know how to describe this for people not in California, but like, you know, just the little sparks that go...
520808	521649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
539928	549474	I've seen my friend's dad is a firefighter, or fire chief actually, and he confiscates all the fireworks.
549494	551275	Confiscates, quote unquote.
552296	554117	Stashes them for his own fireworks display.
554137	555398	Yeah, my brother was a firefighter.
555458	557639	I know all about confiscating.
558440	561322	They had little boxes that are mortars and stuff.
561342	561922	Just stuff that...
563203	563803	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
578038	578538	Thanks for watching!
596167	596888	No, I don't think so.
596948	597148	Really?
597168	598129	We didn't have any this year.
598149	598629	No, they're around.
598869	599109	Are they?
599249	600370	Okay.
600610	609017	So they have those, and their thing was as a big group or a party and stuff, they tried to light off more and more each year.
609357	610958	I think the year we went, they were doing like 250.
611799	614661	I mean, it's been getting more and more.
614701	615702	This was many years ago.
616363	619045	But it was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen.
619205	622087	It literally was a pile that they meticulously, you know,
622647	623748	Thanks for watching!
637642	638523	It's breathtaking.
638543	639523	You just can't stop.
639743	643685	You just have to bust out laughing because it's the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen.
643705	644546	You just wanted to cry.
644606	645446	It was so amazing.
645566	646827	It was crazy.
647227	648688	I wish we had video of it.
648788	656032	That sounds like you'll spend all day setting up dominoes for just that one minute thrill when you knock them all over.
656052	656452	That's basically it.
656492	657973	That's exactly what it sounds like to me.
658053	659994	Setting up 400 ground flowers.
660014	664917	It's gotten so big now that they literally have four or five piles of this stuff.
665407	671831	and it, like, by the time it's done, it's just like, there's like a block radius of just this ground flower just left.
672411	675433	The whole ground flower bomb went off.
675533	676193	Pretty much.
676793	677494	It's awesome.
678294	678634	Nice.
679175	679955	That's amazing.
679975	681176	This was a lot of fun.
682253	689896	Alright, well, hey, we've talked a lot about fire and fireworks, and I'm sure the kids love that, but let's talk about video games a little bit with How Was Your Gaming Week.
690056	691136	Loki, How Was Your Gaming Week?
691676	692337	I didn't play much.
692817	700480	I played, of course, the usual hacked Grand Theft Auto 4, and yes, I have people requesting that I play with them and stuff online.
700620	708903	I can't play with you guys online because our systems are modded, so we have a special version of it, and it just wouldn't work.
709383	709663	I mean...
710163	714845	We have items that I've created, and who knows if it'd crash the game if I tried playing with you guys.
715566	719848	Most likely, you'd be seeing us firing off all these crazy weapons, and you wouldn't be able to do that.
720288	722709	Because it's just the way it works.
723690	726751	And also, the other thing, our work games, we don't invite other people in.
726791	729052	It's just the four of us, or three of us, or whoever's playing.
729373	730113	That's just the way it is.
730273	732714	So don't get that hurt.
732874	736796	Not that I'm trying to ignore anybody, I'm just saying that people have been asking me to invite them.
736936	737377	It's just like...
738478	739640	I can't do that.
739961	740181	Sorry.
740783	743588	Anyways, so beyond that stuff, it's just getting crazy.
743628	744390	You just stuck up.
744751	745192	Just admit it.
745212	745753	You just stuck up.
745833	746675	I'm not stuck up.
746755	747797	I play with other people.
748418	748879	But, um...
750026	750807	Let's see here.
751287	755470	Then, also, I've been playing, I tried Angry Barry.
755510	756350	I finally got it to work.
756390	758632	I found out that it actually wasn't the game Broken.
759072	764416	It was actually, our internet at work is kind of, it's got a weird firewall on it.
764476	769979	They have this, what is it, 86-3000 or something like that.
770059	772261	It's some weird web filter that they have.
772701	775323	Well, they've only, like, unblocked certain ports or something.
775443	778525	So, for whatever reason, like, we can play live.
780026	802138	but like the community game stuff doesn't work because community games whether you guys know it or not you actually have to be connected to live to use any of the community games even if you bought them and they're on your system you have to connect to live in order for it to work that's kind of like what happens with an xbox live arcade game if you're not on your own console that you bought it on but you're under your account it'll kind of check live first exactly sounds like that
802338	808383	But, you know, these are the consoles I bought, or it's the games I bought on this console, so it's kind of annoying.
808824	813107	So, you know, I didn't realize this, but at work I was getting this weird error message.
813448	817671	And it's weird, too, because other community games I've gotten have worked just fine.
817991	824097	But maybe I wasn't, like, maybe they changed something or whatever, because I played Carnivale, and that was kind of fun.
824637	829161	But anyways, so Angry Barry, for whatever reason, didn't work at work.
829597	830318	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
851195	856800	It's got all sorts of crazy enemies and stuff, and all sorts of political references.
857721	858262	So it's great.
858362	859623	So definitely worth checking out.
859643	863546	I think it's only like 400 Microsoft points, so I think it's worth that.
863706	866029	I would like to see a game like this, but with Sarah Palin.
866229	871013	I think it would be very funny, especially now that she's not going to be the governor of Alaska anymore, if you've been watching the news at all this week.
872654	876198	What else is she going to do in her spare time but save the world from crime?
877315	877815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
892845	893465	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
912476	919960	But the game is fun, and now that I've figured out how to cheat and teleport to different spots on the map to get different vista points and stuff, it makes it nice and easy.
920460	929065	But it was funny, though, because the first section of the game, the first little region that you're in, I didn't realize that I've only done one page of the challenges.
929085	929865	I'm like, what the hell?
929885	931266	Why does this challenge say I'm not done?
931306	932567	I'm like, I've done all six of them.
932907	935068	I'm like, oh, there's a page over.
935088	935588	Whoops!
939270	941112	By the way, that happens with races too.
941332	946037	In the second area, in Tsunami Zone or whatever it's called, there's six races, not three.
946518	947779	So just watch out for that.
948300	948580	Okay.
950131	951051	Why can't they put more on my page?
951071	952071	Why don't you get fooled?
952612	953712	I don't know why they did it that way.
954032	956552	But it's important in the Tsunami Reef or whatever.
956612	957653	I think it's what's called Tsunami Reef.
958053	967975	Because those races not only will unlock, you get your Challenge Doppler, the Livery Doppler, but you also get three cars that are new cars.
968175	969895	And when you run into them, you unlock a vehicle.
970235	972976	So it's important to play all those races if you want to get all the vehicles.
973436	973896	Yeah, I do.
973956	976136	Because I'm actually tired of driving as the one side.
976256	978557	I did all those unlock codes for different vehicles.
978797	979258	Nice.
979278	982201	They're kind of eh, but I like the clothing, so I kept the clothing.
982921	985103	But yeah, it's still fun.
985304	989047	And actually, I really wish I had more time to play it because I would be playing it a lot more.
989588	992070	But I've been busy with that and other things.
994471	997495	Yeah, and still haven't got a chance to play Wii Sports Resort.
997875	1003122	Let me get to this question from J-Rod in chat because you were talking about Angry Barry and it kind of brought up community games.
1003462	1006245	J-Rod wants to know, are those community games free to download?
1007166	1012433	They're free to demo, yes, but they do cost money if you want to actually buy the registered version.
1012453	1014015	It's just like Xbox Live Arcade.
1014295	1016176	Except the community games tend to be a lot cheaper.
1016597	1019579	And I mean, the lowest price on the community games, 200 Microsoft points.
1019919	1022781	And another thing too, I haven't really gotten a chance to play around with it yet.
1022921	1028365	The new kind of game making program, Kodu, is actually out now.
1028785	1030186	And 400 Microsoft points.
1030346	1034889	Five bucks for a game that you can make games in and send them to your friends and share stuff like that.
1035490	1036130	Excellent deal.
1037291	1038592	So definitely check that out.
1039833	1040253	Very cool.
1041018	1042018	Anything else for your gaming week?
1064898	1065478	Thanks for watching!
1088149	1088449	I don't know.
1088509	1089209	I do.
1089330	1090510	I need to go play something else like that.
1090830	1094191	But keep in mind also I have a roommate so I can't have the TV whenever I want.
1094832	1095192	Period.
1095532	1099213	So keep in mind that's a big reason why I don't always play Xbox games and stuff.
1099233	1100514	You need to get a VGA cable.
1101161	1102262	For my monitor?
1102402	1103142	Yeah.
1103202	1103822	Maybe I do.
1103902	1105023	Maybe that is something I need to invest in.
1105043	1106163	I play on my computer all the time.
1106183	1107604	That's all I really play on my 360 on.
1107644	1108564	Well, here's something else.
1108584	1109665	I don't want to get teased too much.
1109725	1116388	I didn't play all those Facebook games all week, although I did play some more legitimate things like Bejeweled and Text Twist, and they have Uno on Facebook now.
1116828	1127833	I don't know if you're aware, but they have Uno on Facebook that is similar to the Xbox Live one, except instead of seeing webcams, you're seeing people's little Facebook icons, and you're in a little chat room, so you can actually play Uno.
1129013	1130314	I was checking a lot of that out this week.
1131274	1134055	But I also got a new laptop this week.
1134475	1138616	Fry's is having a really good deal on laptops this weekend because it's 4th of July and all that stuff.
1138977	1140717	So I actually went and got a new laptop.
1140777	1142398	It's a Toshiba, so it's not a bad brand.
1143058	1148140	2 gigahertz machine, 3 gigs of RAM, separate video card inside.
1148200	1149720	It's not like an onboard video.
1149760	1150941	It's got a separated video card.
1152501	1154623	399.99 for this laptop.
1154843	1155844	I know, it was a sweet deal.
1156204	1160067	But what's also sweet about it, here's where the rest of my gaming week comes into play.
1160548	1167213	Because now it's back to a 32-bit operating system, since I don't have so much RAM or what have you, I can play GameTap games again.
1167713	1170816	So I actually spent some time playing Civilization 4 because I missed it.
1171276	1173358	And that was one of the big games I would play through GameTap.
1173738	1179963	So I know I let out a lot of GameTap hate on a previous show because it would not work with my Windows Vista 64-bit.
1180304	1181224	But now I'm running Windows 7.
1182425	1197846	and yeah I installed the release candidate that we all got at E3 I decided you know what since I have a new laptop kind of like a fresh start when better time to upgrade my OS so I upgraded to Windows 7 I haven't played enough games on it yet I'm not familiar enough with the operating system yet
1198446	1223136	I do like it seems to be a faster version of Vista but without all the stuff that made Vista so annoying like it's not asking me like 50 times I'm saying there are you sure you want to install this so and so wants to access your computer it's only done that when I've installed stuff otherwise it leaves me alone and it's it's so much easier to turn off the warning messages and stuff so that was one big improvement I noticed right off the bat I do think Windows 7 will be better than Vista that's for sure
1223877	1224717	Better than XP?
1224978	1225338	I don't know.
1225778	1226739	Still too early to tell.
1227300	1231724	I do like though, here's the one huge thing I noticed, if I can talk operating systems for a minute.
1232545	1242334	Instead of having all your windows at the bottom, like you know how right now you can see, okay, I have Firefox open, IRC, Adobe Audition, the mixer, and all this stuff that you see there.
1242734	1251198	Okay, instead of it that, imagine that what would happen is that you'd see the little icon in the quick launch bar that you had on XP, and it's just like it's a different color.
1251238	1253779	Like the button looks raised because you have windows open.
1254039	1257420	And then when you hover over the raise button, you see little previews of all the windows.
1257921	1259641	That's another huge change in Windows 7.
1259921	1263743	So you save so much real estate on the bottom of the screen with all your windows open at once.
1264063	1264723	That was pretty cool.
1266444	1274930	I'm noticing little things here and there, but being able to play all the old computer games I was missing from not having GameTap work on a newer OS was kind of nice.
1275631	1275971	That's cool.
1276091	1277192	I'm happy about that.
1277292	1281295	Ranma in our chatroom says, Windows 7 release candidate will expire after a year.
1281335	1285558	Yes, I'm aware that the two-hour shutdowns begin in March 2010, but look, that's March 2010.
1285618	1289521	That's still a heck of a long ways away, and apparently...
1290201	1295882	My laptop comes with some type of free upgrade to Windows 7 anyway because I have like Vista Premium came with it.
1295962	1296303	I don't know.
1296703	1298323	They were telling me this at Fry's.
1298763	1303184	There is a thing that you can – it's going to either be free or a small fee.
1303464	1305405	I wouldn't even mind paying a small fee, honestly.
1305445	1313907	But if I contact the manufacturer, it's held onto my receipt so I can get the 7 free because I'm sure I will prefer 7 to Vista.
1314307	1315707	I can already tell I prefer 7 to Vista.
1316027	1320010	I feel weird if I bought an operating system, so I'm going to hold out for the pirated version.
1320391	1325875	But if your laptop comes with it for free, I mean, you know, so I'm entitled to it, right?
1326175	1327236	It's not a piracy thing.
1327296	1328477	It came with my laptop.
1328797	1329838	No, I'm talking about my computer.
1329858	1330378	Well, that's you.
1331920	1332500	So there you go.
1333361	1334842	It's not that I don't want to pay for it.
1334882	1336123	It's just I don't want to pay for it.
1336588	1338710	Yeah, Ranma in chat says, don't worry, you get a free upgrade.
1339310	1346035	And let's see, TigerClaw says, the deals you see about home being $49 and professional being $99 is for those that bought PCs with a Vista.
1346376	1352760	That's interesting because that means that that means it's kind of like an apology for Windows Vista.
1354041	1358925	Ranma in chat goes on, as of last Friday, when you buy any computer, you get a low cost or free upgrade for $7.
1359505	1360046	That's awesome.
1360066	1361527	I picked a great time to upgrade, didn't I?
1362027	1362448	Woohoo!
1363328	1363609	Nice.
1364938	1365958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1391834	1394216	and only $150 more than the cost of a PSP Go.
1395177	1396918	I was listening to an old episode of ORLR.
1396938	1398619	When I say old, I mean just a couple weeks old.
1398679	1404224	We were kind of in that debate about the PSP Go and how Sony is absolutely being idiotic with their price points.
1404284	1407266	It's what's killing this generation.
1407326	1408947	Dude, $249 can buy you a freaking laptop.
1409267	1417734	And we talk about how PSPs are cool because they can do music and games and all the things that a laptop can do.
1418054	1418975	Well, guess what, Sony?
1420242	1423645	A laptop costs as much as you're charging for your PSP Go.
1424926	1427208	Whoever, that was, oh, it's so frustrating.
1427568	1434374	Because it's not that they're bad systems, it's just that Sony's getting... It's just like when, remember the PlayStation 3?
1434434	1440599	Everybody was like, you know, they're showing the system and everything, and it was like, yeah, this looks awesome, this is gonna be sweet, you know?
1441320	1443582	And then they're like, oh, and it's gonna be... $5.99.
1443642	1444743	$5.99, and you're like...
1447691	1449752	Duh, you stupid!
1463752	1465453	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1491888	1493930	My Significant Other has a PlayStation 2.
1493970	1496071	It doesn't play any video games on it.
1496091	1497392	It uses it as a DVD player.
1497672	1507338	There are a lot of people out there like that that will buy it as a player, but kind of knowing that, oh, well, if I wanted to play games on it or had somebody to entertain, I could.
1507358	1518705	It's good, but see, that's the thing, though, is that's good to increase your install base, but when you look at something like that, then think about all the people that did buy it for mainly a Blu-ray player
1519477	1523519	Their numbers already for being in third place aren't that great.
1523759	1533204	And if you take off X amount of percentage of that, saying that these people are only going to be using it for mainly a Blu-ray player, that's really not good.
1534045	1543290	And they were kind of hoping that they would get a little bit of a bump from people buying it as a cheap Blu-ray player, but it's not working out for them anymore.
1544502	1552045	Marissa Congusto in chat makes an interesting comment, chat.orangelandredo.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening as we tape at allgames.com.
1552625	1556847	Marissa says, I was talking about the economy with new game prices the other day with a friend.
1557167	1567372	The prices have gone down over the years, recollecting that if a new game was $60 in 1993 for me, but I still wonder if the new titles can command the same opening price with the unemployment rate skyrocketing.
1567972	1570874	Well, and somebody followed up in chat, well, Sony sure hopes so.
1572775	1577098	To some extent, they do say that even in a recession, people will not neglect their entertainment.
1577178	1577999	I mean, look at movies.
1578719	1585584	Transformers did extraordinarily well at the box office, even with the fact that tickets cost like $10.25 a pop now.
1585944	1587205	I mean, movies are freaking expensive.
1587485	1590828	But Transformers had, what, the second best weekend only to The Dark Knight?
1590868	1592209	I mean, that's still huge business.
1592709	1594590	You know, that's a lot of freaking money.
1594610	1595771	A lot of people are going to see a movie.
1595831	1596352	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1611228	1612808	They can still afford to go to the movies.
1612828	1613689	It's just, you know what?
1613729	1614749	You've got to be smarter about it.
1614769	1618890	If you really want to go see a movie, don't buy the popcorn and soda there.
1619130	1620030	Go see a matinee.
1620090	1620470	There you go.
1620510	1621910	You save yourself a ton of money.
1622490	1627471	It's just that the concession prices are so expensive and the movie prices are pretty expensive.
1627491	1628692	Or go to the drive-in.
1628812	1629172	Damn.
1629192	1634433	You know how much you can save at the drive-in with the double features and bringing in your own crap in the backseat and everything?
1634733	1635133	Hell yeah.
1637357	1640840	I'm surprised the drive-ins do not thrive in an economy like this one.
1640860	1646245	Well, you notice, remember they were talking about closing the drive-in that we have in Sacramento here for a while now.
1646285	1646746	They always do.
1646766	1647827	Every year they're talking about closing it.
1647847	1650069	They're talking about, let's put in a 25-screen theater.
1650129	1650809	Well...
1652403	1653504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1677523	1678644	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1702159	1702539	DarkSakura,
1721630	1724491	What does Sony have to justify that PSP go with?
1724951	1725471	Not a lot.
1725531	1726672	And I'm sorry, fanboys.
1726752	1727932	I know you got your games.
1728332	1730753	I know you got your multi stuff that you can do in there.
1730813	1731293	I'm sorry.
1731713	1732894	It does not justify the price.
1732914	1736115	Now, they did say, and then, you know, I know this doesn't justify anything.
1736135	1740256	They did say that the processor is going to be four times, you know, it's going to be a little bit faster.
1740276	1741157	So...
1743198	1745380	The average gamer does not give two shits.
1745800	1747842	I didn't say they're not going to sell any of those things.
1748242	1753227	There's plenty of Sony fanboys that'll be forking over the money, but it's going to be an embarrassment.
1753827	1755589	They're going to have to cut the price.
1757871	1758972	There will be damage control.
1760754	1761835	When's this thing supposed to be out?
1761975	1762335	August?
1762395	1762635	October?
1762655	1762936	October.
1763456	1769040	Well, then they won't be able to fix it in time for this year's holidays, but next year, you betcha.
1769060	1770161	It's going to tank for the holidays.
1770241	1774924	It's going to be, well, especially, you know, they've got the PSP 3000 still out there now.
1775024	1779267	If you really want a PSP, you know, if you think about it, huh, let's see here.
1779467	1790214	I can buy this PSP system that's $100 cheaper and, you know, get 16 gigabytes of storage or whatever for that for probably a lot less than $100.
1791135	1791995	So there you go.
1792035	1793076	You save money right there.
1793716	1797839	AmazeSatsuma in chat asks, Sky, tank worse than the GBA Micro?
1799720	1803443	Actually, that's not a bad comparison because that was a dumb idea too.
1803523	1806745	I think it was one of those things like, oh, how cute, little tiny Game Boy.
1807005	1809507	But in practicalness, come on.
1809707	1811168	Those GBA Micros were a little silly.
1811208	1818333	I think this is actually worse because the reason why is you're basically saying to your retailers, okay, you need to sell these.
1819033	1820955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1844830	1847392	Yeah, this is just going to be an embarrassment.
1847612	1851354	It's going to set digital distribution for games back a couple years single-handedly.
1851694	1855336	Because then Sony's going to blame it on that, that people aren't ready for digital distribution.
1855416	1856477	No, blame it on your price.
1857298	1860780	And the fact that a system without a UMD drive should be cheaper.
1860800	1865483	And then they see what happened with the price before with the PlayStation 3.
1866083	1867164	Hello, come on.
1867184	1869245	I mean, did you not learn from that at all?
1869765	1896598	I don't want to spend this whole show bitching about Sony's price point because we've done it before but it's just frustrating as somebody who wants to see the good in Sony and wants to see a lot of the good stuff they have on the horizon to just watch them literally literally take out a gun point it at their foot and pull the trigger to watch them literally do this in front of our eyes is frustrating as a gamer I'm sorry as someone who tries very hard to see the good in Sony yeah
1898550	1899971	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.
1900532	1902693	I don't really have a lot for housekeeping tonight.
1903054	1904415	Visit us on Twitter at OLR.
1904755	1908318	Send us emails at Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, etc., etc.
1908898	1909359	Loki, go ahead.
1909827	1916511	Yes, so actually I was going to say, you know, we can talk a little bit about those bundles that they had.
1917191	1927997	There's actually two different bundles that are available now for the 8GB system, which is kind of funny because they're like kind of clearing them out, you know, because everybody thinks, oh, they're going to come out with some new 160GB systems or something like that.
1928357	1933620	That kind of goes back into what the Ars Technica mole said that the...
1935641	1937142	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1962692	1971997	and according to UDN.com, half the orders have gone to Taiwanese group Foxconn and the other half have gone to Pegatron.
1972637	1977419	Wasn't it a Taiwanese lawyer that tried to cease and desist the early images of the PS3 Slimbox 2?
1977459	1977900	Yes, it was.
1979000	2007723	and apparently these were the manufacturers that have I think manufactured the original PS3 so it makes sense and they also said that the timing makes sense the rumor that it's going to be released in August because in Japan they actually have more console sales during the summer as opposed to the holiday season for us in the United States and Canada
2008383	2016287	So, you know, it makes sense maybe that they're trying to sell off all these PS3 80 gig systems to kind of clean out their inventory.
2016707	2023791	And they're doing these kind of bundles to, you know, push out some more systems to kind of make space for this new system.
2023831	2030255	Which, who knows, maybe going into our next story, you know, with the whole emulation thing.
2031576	2033478	Tell us a little more about the emulation thing then.
2033758	2036200	If you're going to open that can of worms, let's talk about it.
2036301	2036881	Definitely.
2036981	2042307	If you think about it, why would I need a PS3 Slim system when I have a PS3?
2042667	2047853	Well, there's rumors now that they may be bringing back the emulation.
2047893	2052317	This is coming from the fact that there has been a new patent issued
2053258	2059442	I guess back in December, talking about full emulation of the Emotion Engine.
2059803	2063405	And the Emotion Engine was the chipset that they had in the PlayStation 2.
2064005	2070630	It's basically what you had in the launch PS3 systems that allowed you to play the PlayStation 2 games.
2071070	2082818	And then, of course, they took out one of those two chips for the 80-gig system that was with Metal Gear Solid 4, and they were doing some of that with software emulation, and then later on they took out all of the chips.
2083518	2094864	and so now you have no emulation but like they did with the Playstation 1 the Playstation 1 is completely software emulated and you can play your discs and you can download Playstation 1 games
2096249	2100110	So you better believe it that they're probably going to have PlayStation 2 game downloads.
2100630	2101431	Here's my thing, though.
2101771	2114515	Are they really going to patch this in and allow everybody to play their PlayStation 2 games, or are they just going to really strictly leave this as software emulation for the titles that are downloaded so that you have to buy your games again?
2114775	2116616	Do they want to piss me off or not?
2116836	2119198	Is basically the question that's out on the table.
2119858	2130686	I would hope if the emulation is being built in there to play these old games and put them out there on the service, which makes a lot of sense as to why now, why this is happening, especially with digital distribution being so big.
2131126	2135109	Maybe the PSP Go will leave because if this thing has a faster processor, right?
2135149	2135909	You said the processor.
2136309	2139131	Maybe these PSP Go's are going to be armed to play the PlayStation 2 games.
2139151	2143714	It's not going to work because the patent's actually for the cell processor to interpret.
2144735	2146235	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2169361	2176207	but just not PlayStation 2 which is noticeably missing from the newer models anyway which I think most people have.
2176247	2178469	I don't have a model that can play the old stuff.
2178830	2179290	That's the thing.
2179890	2181612	How greedy are they?
2181712	2186676	The real question that we need to be asking them because they want the PlayStation 2 to still sell well.
2186857	2191601	They dropped it down to $99 and they still care about that system because it's still selling pretty well.
2191981	2193683	Sometimes outselling the PlayStation 3.
2193723	2193783	But
2197256	2208478	Are they going to be greedy enough to where when this does come out, if they do happen to release this, are they going to do it as a patch where it will allow you to play any PlayStation 2 game?
2208938	2209698	I think that would be good.
2209838	2216399	That would probably get a lot of people that are pissed off at them off their backs, and it would look really good in a PR standpoint.
2216500	2224121	But if they are super greedy, they may also say, hey, we're just going to limit this to the games that you have to download, so you have to rebuy the games.
2224875	2227937	I think Sony has to kill the PlayStation 2 and get the PlayStation 2 owners to move on.
2254588	2259550	That also makes sense, because I think a lot of people are clinging to the PlayStation 2 and are upgrading it.
2259570	2271514	Well, sure, you put a $99 system next to a $399 system, and the average consumer, again, that's just looking for something to entertain their 9- and 10-year-old is going to go for the $99 system.
2271714	2275975	And also, a lot of people are upgrading because they're like, well, I have all these PlayStation 2 games.
2276035	2277976	I don't want to buy a new system and not be able to play them.
2279318	2281160	I never understood that argument in the first place.
2281180	2283401	If you're buying a new system, you still have your old system.
2283441	2284802	You can still play your old games.
2285163	2288385	It's not like all of a sudden your old system is just going to vanish.
2288725	2291688	It's not going to incinerate itself.
2292108	2301095	Speaking as someone who stopped playing PlayStation 2 games when the PlayStation 3 came out, a lot of times it's about space, wires, and just the convenience of it.
2301155	2302156	Convenience is huge.
2302616	2306920	And to me, owning a Wii, an Xbox 360, and a PlayStation 3...
2307560	2308140	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2330254	2330674	DarkSakura.com
2349369	2357013	As gamers who probably download this podcast, interested in the hardcore stuff, there's a lot of people out there who don't even know how to hook this shit up to their TV.
2357453	2359954	They have to call somebody over to explain.
2360334	2361635	Maybe you've been called before.
2361995	2362476	Think about it.
2362796	2373401	Haven't you ever been called to install something like this, like a VCR, a DVD player, a PlayStation, onto somebody's TV, or had to fix it because a wire came out and they didn't know what happened?
2373721	2375442	There's a lot of people that don't understand that stuff.
2376764	2387213	And the other thing too, though, it's kind of, I mean, presumptuous of them to assume that everybody that has a PlayStation 2 is going to upgrade to a PlayStation 3.
2387894	2397642	I think a lot of people have gotten tired of their shit and have already upgraded to a Wii or, well, it's not really an upgrade, but, you know, have gotten a Wii or have upgraded to like a 360 or something like that.
2398302	2399964	And, you know, I was one of those people.
2400124	2401065	I hated the Xbox.
2401365	2401926	Thanks for watching!
2417418	2419199	I'm not paying $600 for this.
2419619	2423581	Luckily, you know, I got it for free, so I didn't have to do that.
2423641	2426302	But, you know, if I didn't get it for free, I would not be buying it.
2426642	2434105	So, I mean, it's just, it's really, you know, and Microsoft's really changed the way I think about them.
2434145	2437446	Because, you know, with the Xbox, it's just like, oh my god, the system's huge.
2437526	2437826	It's just...
2439207	2440227	Learn from their mistakes.
2440387	2444909	Microsoft said, oh, okay, we didn't cater enough to the role-playing game fans.
2444949	2446729	We didn't cater enough to some of these audiences.
2446869	2448630	We're the casual gamer.
2448890	2450010	We're going to try and fix those things.
2450030	2453171	It didn't happen overnight, but you really see that stuff starting to come together with the 360.
2453211	2453372	Sony...
2454952	2455753	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2470322	2473203	fucking smoked weed and made the system that came to them in their dream.
2473263	2475284	I don't know what they did, but whatever they did worked.
2475304	2479166	Because Nintendo just, woo, the Wii was kind of in outer space.
2479226	2480567	Remember when we all first heard of that?
2480587	2481887	We were like, the fuck is this?
2481968	2485409	They redesigned the GameCube and made it with some wireless controllers.
2485489	2488170	It's basically more or less.
2490231	2490512	I don't know.
2492653	2497635	But yeah, I'll be interested to see what happens, but I have a feeling if there is going to be any sort of software emulation, we're going to see it probably by this fall.
2498713	2500975	Uh, J-Rod, interesting comments in the chat here.
2501055	2507419	J-Rod says, I used to be all about my 360, but with Microsoft's piss-poor hardware quality, I've moved on to a PlayStation 3.
2507619	2513142	Ranma says, Microsoft doesn't have piss-poor hardware quality, they jumped the gun to beat Sony.
2513542	2523909	And I kind of agree with both of those comments, that yeah, you definitely notice that Microsoft has the higher hardware issue, and honestly, that system as a piece of hardware...
2525484	2530147	Loud, obnoxious, not the most attractive thing in my living room.
2531368	2534170	But I deal with it because of all the things it provides.
2534870	2535571	Does that make sense?
2537892	2544937	Actually, for me, the audio and the sound portion of the system as far as how loud it is and stuff doesn't really bother me.
2545057	2549299	I have a computer that has countless amount of fans on it.
2549499	2551481	It's super loud and I really don't care.
2551521	2552902	I just don't even notice it anymore.
2552942	2554743	I just totally tune it out.
2555233	2561852	But yes, the PlayStation 3 is immensely quiet compared to the 360.
2562815	2563216	Definitely.
2565741	2567221	Metal Gear Solid 4 and Killzone 2 with it
2594466	2599312	All for $400, so that's not too bad considering you're getting two big games there for $400.
2599772	2608902	Also, apparently, I guess rumors are saying that there's going to be another bundle that could have LittleBigPlanet, I guess, with it as well.
2608922	2609723	Yeah, they do have it.
2609763	2613528	There's one, I think, they do have it with LittleBigPlanet and WALL-E.
2614068	2614548	The Blu-ray.
2614808	2615229	Interesting.
2615789	2618971	That's especially interesting considering WALL-E isn't a Sony movie.
2619151	2619951	It's a Disney movie.
2621252	2622392	That's a little weird to me.
2622432	2624153	You would think they would throw in a Sony movie.
2624333	2625854	Like Kung Fu Panda or something.
2625914	2627735	No, that's not Sony.
2628015	2629276	I understand the need.
2629296	2631097	Obviously, they're going for the family system.
2631477	2633658	But it's very interesting that it's a Disney movie.
2634458	2636479	That sounds more like something Costco would do.
2637000	2638780	You know how Costco bundles all this stuff together.
2638801	2640341	They don't need the manufacturer to do it.
2640802	2641502	Very interesting.
2641862	2642803	But yeah, those are some...
2643903	2644544	Thank you for watching!
2654122	2655023	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2678425	2684471	A Wii bundled with rubber duckies, or a Wii bundled with pirate tattoo arm sleeves.
2686092	2686373	Why?
2686953	2691858	I don't know, but... These are crappy little carnival gifts they're just throwing in with the Wii.
2692238	2694661	Is that really going to motivate someone to go get a Nintendo Wii?
2694861	2696302	Oh, I want to get the rubber ducky!
2697503	2702448	It's absolutely crap, because if you think about it, I mean, these are like dollar store toys, I mean...
2704410	2708212	Why would, it's like, oh, you know, I gotta get a free water gun.
2709893	2711994	I mean, it's a cheap-ass water gun.
2712675	2728223	And, you know, that's the kind of thing now with, like, GameStop, and, you know, in a lot of these places, you know, a lot of people are, like, my customers I deal with, you know, bitching about GameStop having the exclusives for, you know, different content and stuff, unlockables, you know, exclusive things.
2728523	2733346	Like, for example, in the Conduit, they had, you know, the all-seeing eye was blue in the game.
2734639	2754931	that's it it just happened to be blue who cares you know it's like big whoop and this is kind of more like that it's like okay where the hell did you get these free water pistols for and why would you you know even think about bundling them with the Wii I mean why even bother it's just crap but
2755723	2757024	I don't know.
2758025	2760927	I guess they're trying to give some added value to this, but I'm not so sure.
2760967	2761967	That's no value at all.
2762027	2765270	It's like, take a dump and put it in a bag and throw it in there.
2765310	2766611	It'd be worth more than that stuff.
2767651	2768452	Seriously, it's just...
2769764	2770545	What the hell are they thinking?
2770745	2780853	The only thing it did successfully do for them is getting people to talk about it on blogs and on this show because it's so asinine, but that's not a positive.
2780873	2785517	That's not going to make anybody go, hey, I want to go purchase that GameStop because they get crap with it.
2787859	2789640	Again, I'm going to go back to the Costco example.
2789720	2793963	Costco will bundle in useful things with these systems, like a free game or something.
2794383	2795063	But not always free.
2795103	2797465	Sometimes you're paying a little more money for the extra controller.
2797485	2798885	But you want to go bundles.
2799005	2799886	Costco's a good place to go.
2799926	2806309	There are some games out there that are absolute shit that, seriously, they could probably purchase for really, really cheap.
2807130	2809171	And they could throw that in there.
2809191	2810412	And that would at least be...
2811612	2812192	Thank you for watching!
2831952	2832713	I don't even care.
2832733	2835215	It could be like Rubber Ducky Hunter 2009.
2835275	2838137	I'll still do the voice acting because I think that would be awesome.
2850990	2857915	So, yeah, sounds like it could be an interesting bundle, I guess, for crap lovers.
2858576	2862639	Nice try there, but I think you're going to need to do something else, too.
2862659	2863960	Uh-oh, Shermie wants to get out.
2864781	2865261	Hello.
2865862	2866382	Hey, Shermie.
2866402	2874328	Uh-oh, Shermie the cat has been hiding, and I think Shermie wants to get out, but now Shermie's afraid.
2875589	2877871	Live on air radio, these things happen.
2877911	2879532	We have cat drama going on.
2880535	2881517	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2888908	2890870	I don't really have anything else I want to get into right this second.
2890890	2891590	You got some more stories?
2891630	2892011	Yeah, sure.
2892491	2900458	Since we're talking about the Wii, you might not even have to buy a Wii because apparently the emulators for the Wii have been doing a pretty good job themselves.
2900819	2911989	In fact, the Dolphin emulator, which also does the GameCube games as well, has now gotten some games playable and also coming out in 720 or 1080p.
2913790	2942463	so they're able to render the games a lot higher so that kind of gives you 16 times anti-aliasing and they also had some other filters that are thrown on top of there but it kind of gives you an impression of what the Wii would look like if they came out with a Wii HD and honestly that kind of has me kind of excited for a Wii HD if they were ever to do that because some of these games don't look bad actually rendered at a higher resolution and granted some of the textures are kind of
2943383	2947086	I don't know, low res, but Mad World looks sweet.
2948527	2950648	Super Mario Galaxy looks pretty awesome.
2950708	2955492	They had some other videos I saw of... Punch-Out looked pretty sweet.
2956592	2958053	But yeah, there's a whole bunch of these.
2959474	2962556	And actually, the emulator course is available now, and you can check it out.
2962917	2963477	Wait, wait, wait.
2963857	2967420	You can just put the Wii DVDs in your computer and play these games?
2968180	2968280	Um...
2969481	2969861	Out there now, yeah.
2984301	2987262	Nintendo's not worried about this at all?
2987662	2990843	You need a decent computer to run it.
2990983	2993824	Granted, your laptop would probably be able to run this pretty well.
2995104	3004547	But some of the ones that they're showing, I think they're like 4GB processors with 4GB RAM, pretty nice new graphics card and that kind of thing.
3005668	3012230	Still though, it leaves the door open because if you can emulate this stuff on a PC, why not?
3013953	3014914	What is Shermie doing?
3015255	3016756	Shermie's finding other places to hide.
3016816	3017197	I don't know.
3018458	3019960	Just go outside, kitty.
3021462	3022843	You want to say hi to the listeners, Shermie?
3024766	3024986	No.
3025346	3025747	No comment.
3025787	3026488	That's a resounding no.
3031104	3032745	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3053931	3057193	But yeah, do some searches online for Wii emulators.
3057213	3062697	There's actually a guy who does reviews of the emulators and the games and how they play in there and stuff like that.
3063718	3066980	I want to say... Let's see here.
3068361	3068942	I think it's...
3070834	3081187	Rainy Barahona is the user on YouTube, R-E-N-E-B-A-R-A-H-O-N-A, and he has a bunch of different videos.
3081207	3085693	I actually watched the Metroid Prime 3 Corruption one earlier, but he has reviews.
3085873	3088196	I think he's the one that's doing the reviews on them.
3088416	3093539	Let me get some comments from chat real quick because GameGuru wants to clarify PCs can't read Nintendo optical discs.
3093759	3095500	So I was a little crazy there with that comment.
3095540	3101984	But also tells me that Nintendo could get 720p with a firmware update to use those four unused connections.
3102164	3102604	I don't know.
3103124	3110428	I mean, keep in mind, these emulators are running off computer hardware and a Wii is running off the hardware of two GameCubes.
3111029	3116311	Maybe it can't just simply run this with a firmware update or I would have hoped they would have done it a long time ago.
3116992	3117292	I don't know.
3119144	3120485	Yeah, I don't know either.
3120525	3122648	Do you think Nintendo should be worried about something like this?
3122728	3130376	I mean, the fact that their system is being emulated while it is still out there and, some might say, better than the actual system itself?
3130456	3133959	They should be worried if it's actually... Because there are some minor...
3134560	3135341	Thanks for watching!
3161943	3162703	Yeah, I guess.
3163184	3170587	I would actually like to play a lot more of these things on here and check them out to see what the games look like because Mad World looked really sweet.
3170827	3173388	It kind of makes me wish they'd ported to the 360 or something.
3174850	3177731	And all they're doing is they're just smoothing the textures, basically.
3177751	3180212	Yeah, it's 16 times anti-aliasing.
3180452	3185813	It's not like anyone's going back to reprogram these things or anything, or any more work went into them or anything like that.
3186194	3186834	No, not really.
3187014	3202899	And the reason this was actually... I mean, this is... The Dolphin emulator was for the GameCube, and they just modified it to work with the Wii when the Wii came out, because it's basically GameCube hardware and almost the same type of instruction set.
3203139	3203339	So...
3204744	3205104	I don't know.
3205244	3216073	I mean, it just goes to show you that the Wii is really very similar to a GameCube and kind of wish that they would do a Wii HD because at the same time, here's what they could do with their games.
3216133	3222698	They could upscale all the games that have come out and they could do some new higher def games or something like that.
3223159	3230364	Or you can spend the money and just get an upscaler for your home entertainment system and you can just do the same thing with the Wii.
3231325	3232326	So, I don't know.
3233673	3239314	Well, apparently there is a new Final Fantasy game on the way, and it looks like this game is being made for the DS.
3239414	3249916	It was actually teased around there on the internet, and then Famitsu... Actually, no, I'm sorry, it came from Jump Magazine, I believe is the magazine that finally spilled the details on this.
3250296	3251876	It's Final Fantasy Gaiden.
3252296	3255557	It's a new kind of Final Fantasy RPG for the DS.
3255977	3260378	It looks a lot like the Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4 remakes that have happened recently, but...
3260698	3261759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3278596	3281318	There's apparently, though, now action points.
3282199	3290646	When you see your status, you also have yellow dots that go with that, and the actions that you want to do also have dots next to it that indicate how much it's going to cost.
3290966	3294769	So it sounds to me like it's not magic points, but like fighting points.
3295450	3296190	A little different there.
3296610	3302235	It's going to be coming out in the fall in Japan.
3302955	3304737	That would mean probably next year in the U.S.
3304817	3305918	once they get it all translated.
3306258	3306798	Sounds right.
3307119	3307479	There you go.
3308460	3310181	Lots of fun Final Fantasy stuff.
3310241	3311942	I was bringing up here real quick.
3311982	3315424	I wanted to show you Mad World running on the emulator.
3316325	3317506	You should post this link in chat.
3317566	3324030	It's actually a pretty good example of how sharp the game looks.
3324110	3327032	Mad World is all black and white and the line art and stuff like that.
3327592	3329794	You can see how it looks a little foggy right there.
3329834	3333396	That's one of the problems with the emulator, at least in this game.
3334097	3335658	Look at how sharp everything looks.
3337139	3338742	Awesome.
3339523	3340304	That is pretty neat.
3340364	3342947	You should share that in chat if you haven't already.
3343388	3345671	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com That does look pretty nice.
3347734	3348154	Let's see.
3348254	3349997	Some other stuff we can talk about here.
3352981	3360964	We'll probably do one more story and then we'll get into the classic game of the week and part B of our show coming up a little later as well as your phone calls.
3360984	3361844	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3361884	3363965	We'll open up the phones a little later on in the program.
3364165	3368707	Well, Nintendo might not be too worried about some games at least in this emulator.
3369527	3372648	Wii Sports Resort in Japan just came out, what, last week?
3373148	3376089	And already they've sold over 350,000 copies.
3378590	3398585	I'm actually selling, it's the third fastest selling Wii title ever, and it's moved 353,827 copies as of June 30th, so by now, who knows, but it's going to be selling, I think, pretty well in, who knows, when it hits the US, I know this thing's been selling like hotcakes already, so...
3399432	3403996	I actually don't think you'll see the impressive day one numbers that you're seeing over in Japan.
3404136	3411683	I don't think the US audience, especially those that are huge in the Wii, are that as tuned in to when games are coming out.
3412104	3415827	We're much more tuned in in our culture to when movies are coming out.
3415867	3418029	You probably know what movies are opening up this week and next week.
3418049	3419210	I don't think most...
3420307	3424149	Casual gamers and non-hardcore gamers are as tuned in with the release dates.
3424609	3429631	So I don't think you'll see this have the same type of day one sales here, but I think you'll see it grow quickly.
3430312	3430852	Yeah, definitely.
3431132	3437655	I think a lot of casual gamers obviously probably will be picking this up for Christmas or the holidays.
3438275	3440436	There's a long period of time.
3440756	3442017	And look at Mario Kart Wii.
3442037	3444038	It still sells really well.
3445510	3472026	Mario Party 8 that stuff sells really well a lot of these games are just evergreen and will sell for the life of the system so I could definitely see this lasting a long time and it probably will end up selling quite a bit and it could also be like Wii Play whereas people bought this they could be buying this for Wii Motion Plus save some money that way and they get a game with it so I could definitely see something like that happening
3472970	3479453	Yeah, I just don't think, you know, I think when it comes out here, you're going to see, I bet you that first week, oh, it didn't sell nearly as well in the U.S.
3479513	3480254	as it did in Japan.
3480494	3482735	Oh my gosh, it's a failure for Nintendo.
3484015	3484856	Give it a couple months.
3486041	3496404	Give it a couple months for the hardcore gamers who still love Nintendo to pick it up, and then their friends to see it, and then their friends to see it, and then CNN to do a news story on it, and then Oprah to have it on her show.
3497424	3498145	Give it some time.
3498225	3498745	Wrong, wrong.
3498845	3500665	It will not be Oprah having it on her show.
3500725	3503266	It'll be Ellen DeGeneres, because she likes it.
3503306	3505567	Hey, Ellen has a very high-rated show.
3506487	3507287	Don't hate on Ellen.
3507327	3508307	I'm not hating on Ellen.
3508327	3512869	I'm just saying, Oprah's not... She's more tech-retarded as...
3514309	3520273	I don't know if I should admit that I was watching Oprah, but I was changing the channels and landed on Oprah one day.
3520314	3521294	This was a couple months ago.
3521775	3523716	She had Facebook on her show.
3525397	3531181	Oprah, I guess, has this thing where she rips off The View now, where she actually has a panelist of people on some days of the week.
3531221	3531541	I don't know.
3531841	3535564	But she had the dude from Facebook there talking about the business.
3535664	3541028	And I guess that was the same day that Oprah was launching her own Facebook account or official Facebook or something.
3541468	3541828	DarkSakura.com
3559524	3563066	J-Rod says people scream failure if it doesn't sell a million in its first week.
3563106	3564767	Remember how LittleBigPlanet was a failure?
3565167	3578234	Yeah, I would actually agree with you that LittleBigPlanet, not only is it one of the best games on PlayStation 3 right now, period, if not the best in some circles, but I think that's still a game that sells fairly well.
3578254	3582616	I don't know PlayStation 3 figures that well, but that seems to be a consistent seller too.
3582916	3584437	I don't think it's really tapered off.
3585157	3586238	Horrifically or anything.
3587580	3590984	I don't think you can really compare Sony sales figures to Nintendo sales figures.
3591104	3598754	I think it's horribly underrated and underappreciated and it's going to be one of those games like Katamari was where it's horribly underrated and underappreciated.
3599321	3607185	and, you know, granted, we all as game fans might appreciate it and understand how awesome it is, but to the casual gamer, they don't understand it.
3607786	3615130	And, you know, it's sad because I think if you put it in the hands of, like, someone that's more of a casual gamer and they actually played it, they would probably think it's really cool.
3615590	3619732	But then again, there's some people that are just like, oh my god, controllers, oh, I can't do that.
3620192	3624675	Although, really, the only, you know, stuff in LittleBigPlanet is run, jump, and occasionally grab.
3625134	3629019	Yeah, but you have to understand, these are the same people that can't hook up their damn game systems.
3629200	3630461	It's all color-coded!
3630501	3631202	True, true.
3631242	3632204	Yellow the yellow!
3632384	3633746	I mean, it's matching!
3634266	3635428	Matching colors!
3635788	3637351	Can you not understand that?
3639983	3640483	I guess not.
3640503	3641284	But some people can't.
3641584	3642204	Some people can't.
3642845	3644566	Alright, should we get into the classic game of the week?
3645186	3645847	I think we shall.
3646607	3647788	Did you want to say one more thing real quick?
3647808	3648468	I have one more thing real quick.
3648488	3648728	Alright, sure.
3648748	3649349	It's really quick.
3649389	3649469	Go.
3649489	3653191	Electroplankton's coming to DSiWare in Japan only.
3653951	3658794	And, of course, it'll be sold for... Oh, that's a rip-off.
3658914	3665899	Anyways, it's being... They're breaking up Electroplankton because it was ten different little programs that you can make music with.
3666999	3668100	They're breaking them all up.
3669279	3673381	Individually, the 200 Nintendo points each, so $20 total.
3674361	3678322	Seems kind of a rip-off if you ask me, but I think that's what the game originally sold for.
3678342	3679943	Yeah, I was going to say, you had to originally buy it.
3680183	3680763	It was weird.
3680803	3682784	They didn't even market this game big time.
3682824	3684284	You had to buy it through Nintendo's site.
3684304	3685645	You couldn't even get it in stores, remember?
3685865	3691326	Yeah, and having played Electroplankton, I don't get what the point is.
3691566	3696188	I mean, it was neat for a second, and then I put it down and it never touches again, so...
3697850	3704296	I can't recommend buying this, but hey, if you're in Japan and you want to waste some points, there you go.
3705441	3707822	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3733953	3737795	Classic Game of the Week has been a game that I've wasted countless hours on.
3738676	3743159	One of my favorite games that's been on every Nintendo system, it would be Mario Kart.
3744480	3745480	Ah, Super Mario Kart.
3745560	3746701	Super Mario Kart, yes.
3746921	3747341	Careful.
3748442	3756407	I like Mario Kart in general, but Super Mario Kart, the one that started it all on the Super Nintendo, came out in 1992.
3756567	3758588	Wow, that was a long time ago.
3759529	3761470	And did quite well.
3761930	3762270	Sold...
3764569	3774394	I think 8 million copies worldwide and was the, I think, number two title for the Super NES.
3774814	3775194	Really?
3775214	3775855	Yeah.
3775975	3776315	Wow.
3776475	3778316	That must be only behind what, Mario World?
3778736	3779937	Even though that was the pack-in game?
3780797	3781457	I think so.
3781598	3781898	Wow.
3783178	3783558	Let me see...
3785099	3785920	What's the number one game?
3785940	3786740	That's a good question.
3787280	3788061	Super Mario World.
3788081	3789161	Of course it was.
3789181	3790442	I take that back.
3790462	3792383	It was not number two, it was number three.
3792663	3794563	But hey, it's close enough.
3794604	3797405	Donkey Kong Country also had 8 million sales.
3798105	3802087	I want to point out, GameGuru in chat says Mario Kart wasn't on the NES or Game Boy.
3802167	3804008	True, but they still called it Super Mario Kart.
3804028	3805809	The name of this game is Super Mario Kart.
3807296	3818220	Super Mario Kart was one of those Mode 7 games, and you'd race around on kind of a flat track, but of course you had little blocks and stuff that made the course and everything.
3818660	3821301	They had a bunch of different theme levels, including...
3822882	3829550	The Booze Mansion, and... Well, they weren't really a mansion, it was kind of like docks, almost, like this dark place.
3829930	3837799	But Bowser's Castle, of course, they had the Mushroom Cup, Shell Cup, Flower Cup, Banana Cup, and you had to unlock, you know, each of the...
3840041	3842862	I didn't get to get gold in those in order to unlock the rest of the cup.
3843162	3850365	And of course, who could forget the special cup that they had in there with Rainbow Road, which is awesome.
3850405	3852786	Rainbow Road was sweet.
3852966	3856208	But the thing that I spent the most time on and...
3858632	3859112	Vs. Battle Mode
3874180	3877922	We've wasted so much time doing that, but you'd have different shells.
3877982	3881943	Of course, the green shell was kind of dumbfire shell that you'd shoot straight ahead.
3882304	3885905	You've got the red shell, which was kind of a homing missile almost.
3886385	3890427	Your bananas that you drop behind you to skid out the other player.
3891468	3891848	Also...
3892884	3894244	You know, your mushrooms for boosts.
3894804	3904126	And in the original game, actually, they had the feather that you could get that you could jump, and that would stand you for jumping walls or jumping the shortcuts and stuff like that.
3905707	3910048	Of course, later on, they had more sequels for the game on practically every Nintendo system.
3910148	3912528	Actually, on every Nintendo system.
3913068	3920170	And they even made its debut in the arcade with two arcade games, Mario Kart Arcade GP and GP2.
3922605	3926587	The first one, of course, I am famous for playing drunk during my bachelor party.
3927287	3930168	Which by far Orange Lounge Radio's most viewed YouTube clip.
3930628	3934030	And I don't remember much of it, but I actually did play it later on.
3934130	3936671	It was alright.
3937311	3938031	It's not the same.
3938172	3939112	It doesn't have the same charm.
3939472	3940553	No, it doesn't.
3940973	3946576	But, you know, of course, the original Super Mario Kart game had quite a few characters in there.
3947757	3949738	You know, they had some unlockable characters as well.
3949778	3955961	But the starting lineup, of course, you had Bowser, Luigi, Mario, Peach, Toad, and Yoshi.
3956902	3959263	And you could also unlock Donkey Kong Jr.
3959283	3960164	and Koopa Troopa.
3961384	3961584	And...
3963917	3970668	And of course the little trick is you can shrink those down as well and play as little miniature characters which we used to do very often.
3971770	3974173	And um... Yeah!
3974814	3975255	So um...
3977267	3977928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3994904	3995665	Was it really?
3996646	3998508	It was really the first kart racing game?
3999228	3999689	Interesting.
4000410	4001731	I wonder where they got the idea for this.
4001991	4004193	I wonder if they actually fact-checked that stuff.
4004233	4005815	That seems awfully weird.
4006796	4008037	I don't doubt that it's true.
4008117	4010299	I mean, I can't think of another one that there was.
4010760	4011801	But it's just kind of interesting.
4011901	4014003	I mean, I wouldn't have thought of that before.
4015985	4016766	I don't know.
4017267	4019489	But yeah, I mean, lots of fun.
4019809	4022472	And, you know, of course, Mario Kart Wii came out last year.
4022592	4023493	Still pretty fun.
4024915	4032383	But, you know, it just doesn't have the charm, I think, of the original Mario Kart game, which is available for virtual console download, I believe, if I remember correctly.
4032403	4032864	Yeah.
4033866	4034627	Thanks for watching!
4053035	4055036	This was my college dorm years, by the way.
4055196	4058957	Do you know the epic battles we had on this game in my college dorm?
4059357	4062198	And this was probably about 96 or 97 or so.
4062599	4066640	I remember when the people upstairs got a Nintendo 64 and got Mario Kart 64.
4067080	4071862	Oh my god, Mario Kart 64 was just nuts.
4072202	4076744	I was not as big of a fan of 64 as I was this one, but it was still really fun to play.
4077004	4079485	And I think I just... This one is kind of one of those, like...
4080245	4081706	You know, sentimental-type games.
4081726	4094518	And for the love of God, Nintendo, when you put out a new Mario Kart game, and I know how you like doing classic tracks and stuff, is it gonna really kill you to not, you know, include all of, you know, the old battle courses or something like that?
4094758	4099182	They always seem to find the ones that, like, nobody played, and let's just, like, bring that one back.
4099282	4099383	It's...
4100023	4101164	Super Mario Kart 64
4130853	4131153	Damn it.
4132334	4132574	All right.
4132594	4133155	Well, hopefully soon.
4134736	4135296	Well, let's go ahead.
4135316	4136737	We're going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4136757	4142060	When we come back, we've got more news to get into for Part B tonight, and then we're going to take your calls as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4142460	4146603	So stay tuned, guys, because we will be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4153188	4158269	And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, July the 5th of 2009.
4159089	4161070	Believe it or not, we are halfway through the year.
4161150	4162170	I can't even believe it.
4162970	4168592	We are still, of course, taping live as we always do every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
4168632	4173293	If you are listening live, come join us and chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
4173813	4176393	I don't know why we use a separate chat from All Games Radio, but we do.
4176533	4179054	We just always have, because remember Orange Lounge Radio was its own station.
4179634	4180274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4205367	4206789	Anyway, Part B, here we go.
4206869	4210214	We're going to get to your mailbag and the FUs of the week and release dates.
4210234	4211976	We've got all sorts of stuff we've still got to cover.
4212477	4215101	I'm sure, though, Loki has a few more news stories for us.
4215649	4216990	I have tons of new stories.
4217490	4220731	And let's talk about a music game, because that's what's awesome.
4221831	4229975	DJ Hero announced, of course, that they're going to be... I should say Activision announced that DJ Hero would contain Grandmaster Flash.
4230655	4240439	And not only will he be appearing in the game as himself and among the cast of other DJs that are in the game, but he'll also be contributing two songs, including...
4241699	4242520	I'm all about DJ Hero.
4242601	4244283	I think this game looks awesome.
4257984	4260326	Yes, yes, it looks really sweet.
4260486	4267331	I'm not surprised that they're including the old, you know, some of the old, some of the famous DJs, kind of like they do in Guitar Hero, right?
4267471	4271754	You have like Slash shows up and, you know, Buckethead and some of these people, so it's pretty cool.
4272234	4279239	Yeah, so very cool and, you know, just excited that we're gonna, we're hearing more songs coming out of it.
4281021	4281141	Um...
4282182	4284223	What else was I wanting to say about DJ Hero?
4284263	4288285	It's still going to be expensive, though, of course, is the only kind of downside, but what can you do?
4288645	4291427	But the thing is, though, it's the only game I'm buying this fall.
4292205	4292525	Really?
4293145	4294506	Out of all the stuff coming out this fall?
4294526	4297026	It's the only game I'm buying this fall.
4297386	4300267	Because you can't pirate the turntable.
4300327	4300967	I see how you are.
4300987	4306989	No, it really deserves my money, but yeah, it's just with kids coming, you know, really.
4307469	4312990	Honestly, I mean, piracy aside, you know, I'm probably not going to be playing a lot of games in the fall.
4313730	4316931	We'll be playing the Grand Theft Auto expansion, the new one, but that's for sure.
4318011	4320272	But really, with kids coming, it's just like...
4321277	4322618	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4348777	4349437	I don't know.
4349517	4349997	I'm just joking.
4350017	4351258	I don't think she's in the game at all.
4351278	4354599	There's a long list of other DJs I'd rather see in the game than her.
4354659	4355219	Fine.
4355379	4355700	Fine.
4356680	4357900	I try to make a silly little joke.
4357980	4358481	I know.
4358501	4359141	That's what I do.
4360021	4362062	Have we heard a lot about download content with DJ Hero?
4362202	4362882	There will be some.
4363022	4363922	That's about all we know.
4365623	4373746	Because I know someone actually, for whatever reason today, I visited their website and actually looked at their Twitter and there was someone asking, hey, is there going to be download content?
4373786	4376407	And they're like, of course there's going to be download content.
4376892	4383057	But not necessarily regularly, like you see in Rock Band, because Guitar Hero's download content seems to be a bit more sporadic.
4385079	4387862	Yeah, I would be guessing that it's going to be a bit more sporadic.
4388562	4393687	Marissa Congusto in our chatroom, chat.org.com, says it could be a pixelated Lohan tweeting naked pics.
4394627	4396469	That would be true to life, wouldn't it?
4397270	4398491	A little too true to life.
4398511	4399692	Alright, what else do you have for us, Loki?
4400981	4410370	Also, of course, not really something I would utilize and not really something you'd utilize anymore, but Twitter has come to Warcraft.
4410931	4421521	Thanks to TweetCraft, an in-game client that you can get, you can now Twitter inside the confines of World of Warcraft.
4423581	4428027	This would actually be cool, believe it or not, if I was like a role player.
4428748	4436938	I think it would be kind of neat to have a character using a Twitter, like create a character and have them tweet about the things they're doing in World of Warcraft.
4437699	4439701	And I think that's probably what most people would use it for.
4440142	4442184	But I just hope it doesn't turn into this whole like...
4442825	4444186	Oh, I just turned in this quest.
4444426	4446767	Oh, I just dinged to level 77.
4447207	4448648	Oh, we're running this instance.
4448668	4449328	Anyone want to join?
4449348	4451469	Because we don't really need to fill Twitter up with that garbage.
4451809	4454390	I hope none of my personal friends are going to use this for that.
4454791	4464635	But if they're using it to keep all the crack in their vein, like they play World of Warcraft and have Twitter at the same time, I can also understand the need to have that crack all at once.
4464955	4470858	All they need now is Facebook as well in World of Warcraft if they don't already have it, and then everybody's crack should be set.
4471998	4476080	According to the screenshot here, it doesn't look like they're using it for roleplay.
4476100	4485663	In fact, one of the people says, Thank God CNN's finally segwaying from reporting on Michael Jackson still being dead to reporting on what happened to Bubbles the Chimp.
4487143	4488964	Information we need to know right away.
4489424	4491324	I'm reading this stuff in chat, which is great.
4491564	4494405	TigerClaw says, Great, now you can tweet when you're in a WoW raid.
4495046	4499347	SSJ100Matt says, At Rob, I just got a 4-strength 4-stam leather belt.
4500265	4502306	That's an All Games Inside joke, I'll have you know.
4503147	4504788	Frisbee says, Mom, bathroom!
4509691	4509911	Nice.
4510272	4515195	Let's just encourage people to not have any human interaction whatsoever by putting Twitter in World of Warcraft.
4515674	4516254	Exactly.
4516654	4528037	I'm not going to say I'm glad I left because I'm not vindictive about the reasons I left, but I am comfortable with my decision and that there's many other games to be playing right now.
4528437	4530738	Although, sorry, I will say this.
4530818	4537500	I am kind of sad that I feel like some people I don't talk to anymore because I don't play World of Warcraft, which is kind of sad.
4537740	4539520	I'm like, just call me, dude.
4539640	4540180	Let's hang out.
4540580	4542781	Let's do something besides raiding.
4543001	4544421	Hangout in World of Warcraft?
4544601	4544881	I know.
4546042	4546622	No.
4547562	4552043	And something you may need if you really are living the sedentary lifestyle.
4552343	4553623	Hopefully I will never need this.
4554123	4563945	But there is a new DS plug-in that you can use with your DS and DSi because it actually plugs into the DS slot and not the Game Boy Advance slot.
4564465	4565366	But it is a...
4567606	4577348	a device called Digit and it's for helping diabetic kids record their sugar levels so that they can see if they're okay.
4577668	4580709	It helps them test their sugar.
4582769	4583209	I don't know.
4583229	4585910	So really you can turn your DS into a diabetic monitor now?
4585970	4588430	Yeah, it's a sugar glucose reader.
4589350	4591871	I'm not sure if you can use this like
4593396	4595457	Well, I'll tell you right now, your insurance ain't going to cover it.
4595657	4598358	So you're going to be paying for that out of pocket.
4598798	4602420	But I guess what it is probably, it's like a diabetic monitor.
4602440	4604761	You know when you're diabetic, you have to track this.
4604961	4605841	My grandma was diabetic.
4605861	4607482	You have to track your glucose several times a day.
4607842	4608923	It depends on how...
4609843	4611404	There's different stages of diabetes.
4611444	4612865	It's a very common disease.
4612905	4614006	Halle Berry has diabetes.
4614306	4615687	A lot of very famous people have diabetes.
4616267	4619849	You have to track your sugar levels at several points throughout the day.
4620409	4625532	You might be what they call insulin dependent, where if your levels are really out of whack, you have to inject yourself with insulin.
4625873	4633277	This monitor, if they're encouraging kids to use this monitor with their DS, is probably a way to track those levels, but more so for their parents to look at it, I bet.
4634257	4636719	It's actually kind of a neat use of technology.
4637219	4639860	I actually think it's kind of a neat use of the DS.
4640020	4645123	This is a feel-good CNN good news story of the week type thing.
4645723	4647264	Hey, Nintendo didn't think of it first.
4649265	4650926	Screw you, Vitality Monitor.
4651998	4656881	Alpha Catanagram in chat says, Loki, yeah, this looks like Bayer's rebranding of the Glucoboy Independent.
4657141	4660624	They look the same, so I'm guessing Bayer bought the tech from the guy that made Glucoboy.
4660804	4661284	Probably.
4661464	4661904	Possibly.
4662485	4662845	Who knows?
4663405	4667208	Frisbee asks in chat, when can I have the Wii Fit glaucoma meter?
4671283	4672806	I do think it's a pretty neat idea.
4673667	4678794	Hey, look, you brought up World of Warcraft earlier, and I wanted to talk about this a little bit because I thought this story was very interesting.
4678854	4684463	Having been in a game that was ruined by gold farming, or in that particular game, gill farming...
4685504	4686385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4709764	4712165	I don't know if you're aware, but not really.
4712445	4714165	That's not really what happened.
4714505	4725549	Here's what China really banned, was using virtual money for gambling and will be punished by public security authorities, and miners cannot buy virtual money.
4726109	4727609	Here's what it really comes down to.
4727850	4729650	Well, A, it's minors, too.
4729710	4730670	It's not adults.
4730951	4737693	But also the fact that the real problem, and Richard Heeks, who is a professor at the University of Manchester, kind of breaks it down.
4738853	4741374	What it really is is using these fake currencies.
4742434	4744356	One of the big ones is called QQ Coins.
4745577	4747438	Used to buy real... I know, funny, huh?
4747839	4749860	Used to... QQ, I don't have any real money.
4750561	4754004	Using these QQ Coins to pay for virtual game stuff.
4754744	4757887	Apparently some folks were using them to pay for real things.
4758467	4785093	and that's what the law is to prevent using virtual currency to buy real products that's what it comes down to and most people are when you do gold farming that's the other way around you're paying real money for virtual items that's still okay it's the other way around that is now illegal which isn't going to impact any of the gold farming industry I'm sorry to say and that makes everyone go QQ exactly because the QQ dollars are still out there that's all I got
4785987	4786927	That's funny.
4787668	4789369	Do you think they should ban the real thing?
4792430	4793291	I don't know if they can.
4794051	4794911	That's where I'm at.
4795091	4796032	I'm like, you know what?
4796772	4797853	Why bother at this point?
4797993	4798533	It's out there.
4798653	4802175	It's up to the game makers, I think, to some extent, to stop this shit if they want to.
4803115	4803375	Really.
4804096	4806877	If they really wanted to stop this crap, they could, but most don't.
4808638	4814501	And really, you know, as much as I see, you know, it's not a good thing to buy money...
4815669	4816109	Thanks for watching!
4833973	4836434	Plus, it also depends on the game's design.
4836634	4839774	Like, I don't think gold farming is that big of an epidemic in World of Warcraft.
4839834	4840535	I know it's out there.
4840555	4841375	I know it's being done.
4841815	4844476	But in World of Warcraft, it's not that hard to make money.
4844996	4845796	They have dailies.
4845836	4846856	They have ways to make money.
4847156	4848497	Gold farming is for lazy people.
4848917	4850637	If people are too lazy to make gold the hard way.
4850877	4851417	Now, here's the thing.
4851457	4854238	In Final Fantasy XI, you couldn't make gil that easily.
4854498	4856518	You could not make gil as easily as you can make money.
4856798	4857579	And some would argue with me.
4857599	4858879	You have to camp, like, on a really
4859099	4859480	and so on.
4874760	4880468	is that, you know, gill farming was an epidemic and it was killing the game because what would happen is, yeah, what was the only way to make gill?
4880729	4884754	You camp these notorious monsters that would drop items that would be worth millions of gill.
4884995	4885535	Well, guess what?
4885555	4888139	All the gold farmers are out there camping with you and they got good at it.
4888680	4890362	But WoW doesn't have that as an epidemic.
4890783	4890943	So...
4891923	4904691	you know finally years later they changed it in Final Fantasy where the items would bind a certain way you know it just took them too damn long to do it lessons again I hope they have learned moving into Final Fantasy XIV because Final Fantasy XIV has the potential to be amazing
4905643	4911209	Ramma S in our chatroom, chat.orangehauntry.com Now with Final Fantasy XIV, will they shut down Final Fantasy XI?
4911469	4911789	Hardly.
4912169	4912670	No.
4913571	4916013	Will they have to do server consolidations and things of this sort?
4916073	4916514	Probably.
4916774	4917635	Will they lose players?
4917755	4918235	Probably.
4918856	4921178	But they'll probably charge more for Final Fantasy XIV.
4921478	4925262	Not a lot more, but they'll probably charge like $14.95 or $15.95 a month.
4925582	4926884	Because they could probably get away with it.
4928047	4928387	I miss Eleven.
4928407	4929468	I had a lot of fun with it.
4929508	4930469	I don't have the time for an MMO anyway.
4930489	4932950	But I'm looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.
4951519	4953120	I am definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.
4953240	4954121	I'm all over that shit.
4954281	4957103	I'm not looking forward to it because I won't be able to play it, probably.
4957583	4957924	Poor thing.
4958524	4959985	What you can do, come over to my house.
4960285	4960726	You can play.
4961226	4963688	Just, you know, tell the wife you're coming over to hang out with Rob.
4963708	4964388	We're going to watch movies.
4964408	4968631	I don't want to do that either because babies... Bring the kids.
4970312	4971193	Get them into it.
4971273	4972013	No, no, no.
4973054	4973314	You know...
4974560	4977422	I... Nellie doesn't want the kids playing video games.
4977622	4981564	I mean, basically she doesn't want them ignoring homework to play the video games.
4982045	4982665	Which is fine.
4982905	4984286	I understand that, because you know what?
4984586	4985267	I never did that.
4985567	4991050	I always did my homework, and then, well, I mostly did my homework, and I didn't really play video games.
4991110	4992591	It wasn't an issue like that, but...
4993968	4994849	They're gonna play video games
5009108	5009828	for two hours.
5010209	5020773	You want to watch cartoons, you want to play video games, whatever the F you want to do on the TV, I wouldn't say that, obviously, but whatever the F, and me explaining it to you, whatever the F you want to do for the TV with two hours, that's yours.
5021173	5026635	But either A, once your homework gets done first, or B, once your two hours is up, you better be doing your homework.
5027215	5028776	Or you're going to lose your TV time.
5029236	5030537	You know, something like that.
5030657	5032297	That's the kind of system I think you have to do.
5032498	5033218	Always homework first.
5033298	5035059	Yes.
5035699	5037480	Okay, let's talk a little bit about...
5040325	5046207	Wait, can I say, can I say, because this is obviously a sparked discussion in our chat room, I have to read this at chat.orangelunchradio.com.
5046267	5059973	First off, about Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, SJ100Matt says they still, they said they will continue to release expansion for Final Fantasy XI, and especially now that they're doing the download expansions now, like there's the MOG, the coup d'etat, or whatever they call it, the
5060293	5063095	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5082757	5084218	Also, some comments on the babies.
5085679	5088762	TigerClaw says, they're going to play video games while parents are asleep.
5089502	5089943	That's true.
5090343	5093345	If the TV is in the kids' room with the console, they're going to play the video games while you sleep.
5093365	5094426	TV's not going to be in the kids' room.
5094887	5099050	GS68 says, from kindergarten through third grade, my parents would only let me play video games on weekends.
5100351	5104654	And I'm thinking, you know, the kids can play not the new console games.
5104674	5110899	They've got to play the old stuff, because the old stuff is more family-friendly, you know, whereas the new stuff, you know, no playing Grand Theft Auto.
5111240	5111660	Although,
5112364	5117768	Although with Grand Theft Auto, I know enough about hacking it that I could probably take out the blood and stuff.
5118549	5123892	Marissa Congusto in chat says, My dad had a really good parenting strategy so I couldn't play too many video games.
5124253	5125754	He played them so I couldn't.
5127095	5127935	That's more like it.
5128396	5131318	You should suggest that to the wife.
5131418	5133660	I'm only playing video games so the kids can do their homework.
5135001	5135901	I'm doing you a favor.
5136262	5136822	Now cook dinner.
5138043	5138723	She doesn't cook.
5138843	5139584	I cook dinner.
5170618	5181196	Uh, tech thing that they, I guess, registered a patent for that's gonna utilize what looks like a giant square-shaped U thing, almost like a...
5182079	5187183	The U-Force, you know, kind of scary enough, but apparently you would use this device in your hands.
5189284	5202334	I guess to replace the Cosmic Ice Cream Cone thing, but you would use it, I guess, like a baseball bat or golf club or sword, whatever.
5202454	5203575	That thing's going to get broken.
5204336	5207518	That thing looks retarded, if you ask me.
5207598	5208679	Well, maybe it was just patented.
5208719	5210140	That doesn't necessarily mean they're going to use it.
5210880	5211241	I don't know.
5211261	5211481	I just...
5212902	5214883	Giant U of Death.
5215363	5218024	Alpha Catanagram is saying that's just a random object, not a controller.
5218184	5221625	That the U is supposed to represent some type of object the person has in their home.
5221945	5227867	And that's what I had thought I had read is something about that you can use this thing is supposed to be like so any object can be used in the game.
5228147	5229027	Which is kind of similar.
5229108	5230868	Isn't that similar to what Natal was saying too?
5230928	5231108	Yeah.
5231228	5234029	It's going to be able to scan like the kid's skateboard in a little preview.
5234049	5235070	Okay, well that, yeah.
5235090	5236370	So something similar here, right?
5236390	5237910	That'll work as well as they show.
5237950	5238271	But yeah.
5240283	5241364	That's neat.
5242404	5246906	I don't like the idea of swinging around something that even resembles a baseball bat in my house.
5247786	5248767	Unless it's a Nerf bat.
5249827	5250307	Even then.
5250347	5252888	Couldn't you just roll up a piece of paper and tell the game it's a bat?
5253468	5254309	It would work, right?
5255309	5256129	Roll up a newspaper?
5256169	5256530	Thunk.
5257690	5259611	Couldn't I hold up the cat and say it's a baseball bat?
5259771	5259891	Meow.
5261499	5264941	How long is it gonna take before someone tries to use their penis on this?
5265521	5266562	It's gonna happen.
5267082	5269743	That's the age-old question about new peripherals.
5269823	5271724	How long before a penis is used with it?
5272065	5272565	How long?
5273846	5274906	Try 30 seconds.
5276087	5279629	That's the length of time to unzip the pants and undo the belt buckle.
5280229	5281029	Scan this!
5284907	5285467	Oh my god.
5285527	5285788	Alright.
5286028	5286428	Hey, look.
5286468	5287689	We got some emails we gotta read.
5287729	5288770	So let's get to the mailbag.
5288790	5289350	How's that sound?
5289370	5295515	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is where you send your emails every week and we read some of our favorites here on the show.
5295915	5297617	That's exactly what I'm gonna do right now.
5297937	5299718	Since DarkSakura's not here tonight, I will read them.
5300099	5304862	If you can scan objects to be used as guns, you can have your own laser cat.
5306283	5308525	Yes, whatever happened to laser cat the video game?
5308565	5310527	You think with community games we would have this now?
5311127	5311868	I'm surprised we don't.
5314567	5316429	Sorry, I had the music blurring that whole time.
5316469	5319591	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email.
5319692	5322574	First email to us tonight comes from Rick.
5323875	5326898	And Rick sent us an email and the subject is Nintendo Divorce Notice.
5327844	5328464	Thank you for watching!
5355595	5357776	And then the Wii came along and life was good again.
5358236	5364137	We had such good times together with Zelda, Metroid, and Mario, but there was something wrong, something nagging in the back of my mind.
5364658	5367038	Could it be all the shovelware that was becoming more and more common?
5367398	5370619	Could it be all the ported games with Waggle attached for no fucking reason?
5371019	5372540	Could it be last year's E3?
5373020	5374160	Could it be all the party games?
5374480	5375080	What's next?
5375160	5376001	Motion Control?
5376081	5376481	Yaris?
5377363	5378084	you let me down yet again
5389520	5390280	Why should I stay?
5390580	5392641	What can you offer me as a reason to hang around?
5392921	5395982	Why shouldn't I just go and sell my Wii and put the money towards a PlayStation 3?
5396983	5398083	More Mario Galaxy?
5398123	5399183	You lazy bastards.
5399223	5400784	That's just fat you trimmed from Galaxy 1.
5401664	5402685	Mario multiplayer?
5402785	5403745	Ported from the DS.
5404165	5404605	Zelda?
5404845	5405345	A painting?
5405606	5406486	A frickin' poster?
5406786	5411448	And they said the Zelda game actually is not going to be very different than the first one, which means it's going to be written on the same engine.
5412028	5414669	I'm reading this poor man's pleas to the divorce court.
5415009	5416409	A statement about no sword?
5416629	5417090	That's it?
5417170	5417730	Get fucked!
5418590	5419835	Kid Ikea RS
5421215	5422456	Oh, it's there.
5422536	5422976	It's coming.
5423036	5423637	News flash.
5423657	5424337	We don't care anymore.
5425158	5428581	At the end of the day, I'm going to be a dad soon, and my time will be a precious commodity.
5429001	5430802	I need to know that you are taking things seriously.
5430863	5433244	If not, I'm walking to the nearest Sony store.
5433745	5434425	It's so sad.
5434926	5438208	You used to try so hard and produce such wonderful gaming experiences.
5438549	5439669	You were top of the pile.
5440270	5443652	Now you're more bothered about coming on to my grandmother and small children.
5443853	5445234	You disgust me, Nintendo.
5445714	5446595	Regards, Rick.
5447255	5447576	P.S.
5447736	5449037	I get custody of the Nintendog.
5451308	5455449	Well, we will see how that holds up in divorce court with Judge... Who is it in divorce court?
5455469	5456009	Judge Mabel?
5456029	5457009	I think it's Judge Mabel.
5457649	5460510	Of course, if he's in the UK, he's not even going to get that joke, so forget it.
5461330	5461630	Alright.
5462470	5466331	That was a well-written divorce letter, and I can't say I... It's tough.
5466871	5473652	It's tough being a hardcore gaming fan and watching what's going on with the Wii, but at the same time, I think he summed it up right at the end.
5473892	5478433	They're more interested in hitting on your grandmother and little children, and they're doing a good job of it.
5478473	5479233	You can't deny that.
5480073	5480253	But
5481364	5483125	We're just not the bread and butter for Nintendo anymore.
5483185	5486487	Maybe Nintendo felt they already lost us between the 64 and the GameCube.
5487448	5487748	I don't know.
5487948	5488888	Well, wait not to try.
5489569	5494531	But my thought is a lot of us were children or at least younger when those systems were out.
5494972	5495652	I mean, wouldn't you?
5496012	5496332	I don't know.
5496713	5504337	The problem is they're kind of catering to stupid people, but they think that people like
5505445	5508307	Oh my god, games are so hard, I can't play them.
5508527	5511048	Well, you give it to a kid, he's going to figure it out.
5511608	5516131	I mean, I was a kid, I figured out how to play video games.
5516771	5520293	I may not have been good at it at first, but it took time.
5520353	5521493	I had to practice, get better.
5522354	5524835	And nowadays, I think kids should do the same thing.
5524875	5528277	Because if they're just immediately great at it, then good.
5528437	5531178	It gives them a self-esteem boost, but they still suck.
5531238	5532499	It's just the game is really easy.
5534672	5542296	Now I'm looking in chat and some folks want the emailer to understand about Metroid Other M. They neglected in their whole little statement there.
5543077	5545878	But J-Rod offered up this interesting retort.
5546338	5550521	I can think of at least three games from both Sony and Microsoft from E3 that I want on day one.
5550541	5553182	Nintendo had one game during a two hour conference.
5555081	5556382	Thanks for watching!
5571994	5572995	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5601325	5602626	This is a very serious turtle.
5602646	5603826	We need to take this very seriously.
5604526	5607808	Guys, a couple months ago I discovered Podcast Alley and thus your show.
5607928	5609528	I forgot we were listed on Podcast Alley.
5609548	5611709	That's an old school podcasting list.
5612109	5612509	Exactly.
5613210	5614230	Oh my lucky stars.
5616951	5618932	I've been needing a show like this my whole life.
5620205	5626688	I don't have any friends who are hardcore gamers like me so when I heard your show it was fantastic to hear people like me who talked about the things I care about.
5626988	5630930	Thanks for all the time you invest in this show and tell Loki to stop yelling the turtle.
5631130	5631470	Sorry.
5632331	5632971	I have a problem.
5635031	5640113	Look, this serious turtle has a serious issue with you, Loki, and that is that you yell too damn much.
5640293	5641514	I gotta talk to you about something.
5641534	5642014	This is great.
5642154	5642494	Oh, no.
5642514	5645155	This is gonna totally go on a tangent, but it's funny.
5645275	5645515	Fine.
5646216	5652098	So, apparently earlier this week, Nelly was convinced that I had Asperger's Syndrome.
5653522	5655765	Isn't that kind of like... It's like autism.
5655925	5658828	Okay, so your wife thinks you're autistic, yes.
5658848	5668259	Yes, because apparently people stricken with Asperger's, they have the tendency to be very focused on certain things or whatever.
5668299	5670722	Basically, I piss her off a lot by like...
5672023	5672924	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5689360	5690181	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5720588	5722091	This show just isn't enough, Loki.
5722632	5725015	I do this at work.
5725235	5728981	You've spent at least seven years of your life getting the gaming knowledge out there.
5729001	5731004	In a way, this radio station is perfect for you.
5731625	5733728	I don't think it's as perfect.
5733768	5734550	Go to a doctor and...
5735150	5743633	No, no, there's no, there's nothing that has to do with that because it's actually, you're very socially, you know, unable to cope with everything, basically.
5743953	5746074	You can't, you can't function in society.
5746174	5749875	We're not medical professionals, we're not even going to try and get into it, but it's, you know.
5749995	5754457	It was funny because there's a lot of symptoms on there and they're like the different work fields that would be perfect for you.
5754597	5759779	Okay, but look, you go into WebMD, like, and you tell WebMD you have certain symptoms.
5759859	5761039	I've got this and this and this and this.
5761219	5762780	Every time it tells you, cancer.
5763200	5769462	Every time you go in there and you're like, oh, I've got a rash on my ass and it kind of, you know, it flames a little.
5769542	5770422	Oh, you have ass cancer.
5770722	5771382	You know, like.
5773103	5774323	Or like, or yeah.
5776824	5779225	You're all yes or no, it's not the tumor.
5780305	5782106	Anyway, sorry to get off on a tangent there.
5782146	5783106	I just thought it was funny.
5784929	5785189	Alright.
5786210	5786711	Next email.
5787511	5788592	Yes, please, next email.
5789493	5791194	Stop trying to talk about things you know nothing about.
5792355	5792636	Alright.
5793376	5794877	This comes to us from Deathwishing.
5795874	5798955	I feel like I have not been involved in your shows for a long time.
5799035	5799875	Have I missed a lot?
5800135	5800355	Yes.
5800995	5802796	Anyways, now to get on with some email material.
5802836	5805157	Have you guys ever heard of a game called Urban Terror?
5805557	5810758	Well, if you have not, then there is no reason to not try the game because, well, it's absolutely free.
5811258	5815059	It was originally a Quake 3 mod and then went into its own standalone game.
5815500	5823382	I cannot describe how it plays, but I guess it's a mix, I think a combination of Counter-Strike and Quake, hence it being a Quake 3 mod.
5824062	5826023	Well, let's hope I don't miss the cast again.
5827664	5828485	I've never heard of this.
5829025	5829625	Urban Terror?
5830506	5838891	The only thing I've heard of, there was a Urban Chaos or something like that game that was from Eidos or something that really sucked.
5839772	5840812	But that sounds kind of neat.
5843134	5845115	Email number four from Shook.
5846411	5852195	Hi everyone, I've been following this show for about three months and I can honestly say that this is the best video game related show I've ever listened to.
5852255	5852736	Why thank you.
5853456	5858280	I encourage you guys to keep doing this show and if you're reading this on the 7th anniversary, I wish to congratulate you on the feat.
5858740	5862302	Well, you're a week late, but that's probably my fault because the 7th anniversary show still hasn't hit the feat.
5862382	5865365	But thank you nonetheless, 7th anniversary or not.
5865645	5868847	We'll say that's a pre-grats for our 8th anniversary.
5869167	5869788	Yeah, there you go.
5870891	5873313	Last email tonight from the one and only Spazinator.
5873393	5877736	Hi everyone, I thought I'd write this email for tonight's show mainly to share a tidbit of info.
5878156	5881618	By the looks of things, Sony will be doing three things more or less in tandem this summer.
5882319	5890864	Rolling out the long rumored PS3 Slim, drop the price of the PS3 by an unknown amount, and release firmware 3.0 which by most accounts will be a fairly big overhaul.
5890884	5894127	So I'm reading this email because we've addressed some of this but we didn't really talk about new firmware.
5894947	5904034	Most sources agree that Firmware 3.0 has certain features on it similar to what Xbox Live has, reputation and griefing procedures, as well as finally being able to download game updates in the background.
5904435	5912641	Where there is still some debate as to whether or not Firmware 3.0 will also incorporate the recently uncovered patented PS2 emulator that will supposedly work on all PS3s.
5913002	5920448	My suspicions are that the emulator will indeed be coming, most likely in Firmware 3.0, or at least in the next major firmware update after that.
5920848	5921628	My reasoning is this.
5921929	5928111	There is no reason for any company, Sony or any other one, to patent anything unless they see a way to make money off of it, directly or indirectly.
5928671	5939676	Seeing as the PlayStation 3 sales have been lagging behind the Wii's and the 360's, hell, even the PS2's, these moves that I have mentioned should, in theory, bolster sales, which is ultimately what Sony and some third-party developers want.
5940296	5945160	Ultimately, this is all just hearsay, educated guessing on my part until we see here something official.
5945480	5951444	However, given my track record in as far as relaying info, it's subsequently being true.
5951564	5954246	See a prior story I relayed regarding Capcom releasing games on PSN.
5954646	5956387	Odds are this will be proven true as well.
5956768	5957808	Well, that's a bit of a...
5958709	5974717	and it also makes sense too because if you think about it it kind of eases them into digital distribution with PS3 games because you have the PS2 games coming out now and I'm assuming those are going to be at a higher price point than the PlayStation 1 games were you know for the most part I would assume that they're going to be maybe around you know
5975418	5979443	15 to... I would say even 15 to like $30.
5979543	5981706	Maybe $15.25-ish.
5982186	5991358	And if that does well, then of course that means, hey, let's release some PlayStation 3 games for more money as well and see if we can get away with selling those.
5991498	5991679	So...
5993503	5997686	I'm pretty sure we'll probably see this stuff later this year.
6016400	6017581	Well, thanks for taking this email.
6017621	6019484	It's appreciated, and keep up the excellent work.
6019524	6023248	This email was brought to you by Loki's tingle costume, which kindly asks him to wear it.
6023588	6023889	Lol.
6025210	6026451	Thus ends the email bag tonight.
6026511	6027893	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
6027913	6029935	If you have an email you want to send us in a future week.
6030276	6031597	Sorry, no tingle costume.
6031918	6033700	I do believe that you are about 800,000 copies shy.
6036693	6038354	In other words, he hasn't even made the costume yet.
6038374	6040496	You're going to have to get to like 50,000 shorts.
6040576	6041577	It's never going to happen.
6041597	6042757	They've stopped making the game.
6042837	6043278	It's done.
6043298	6043938	It's not going to happen.
6043958	6044819	It's a done deal.
6045920	6048121	Now all of you should be focusing on a new bet.
6048482	6049342	You can get Loki to take it.
6049362	6051304	And no, I am not making any bets on the PSP Go.
6052064	6052605	I'm sorry.
6053225	6065434	I don't know what that's going to do because there are a lot of... To be honest, I have a problem with people buying the iPhone because I think it's retarded, but there are people out there that like to spend a lot of money on stuff that's kind of...
6065939	6067481	You guys are going to have to think really hard.
6067561	6069323	And also, Frisbee brings up a good point.
6069444	6070865	Sackboy costume was better anyway.
6071126	6073429	Let's not forget Loki did dress up as Sackboy, which was pretty cool.
6073449	6073809	Exactly.
6074149	6076152	I have the head now in my garage.
6076292	6077934	I know, it scared the hell out of me when I first saw it.
6078695	6082240	Alright, some more news, then we'll get into some release dates and the FUs of the week as well.
6083606	6084287	Let's see here.
6085047	6092131	So let's talk a little bit about Xbox 360.
6092871	6101536	Last time they've got some information on that and how it will be integrated into the new Xbox experience.
6102296	6130020	apparently Last.fm is going to be free for gold subscribers however if you are a silver member you do get to use 3 hours per month and if you're a I guess you'll have to shell out I guess another $36 a year if you're a silver member and just want to use Last.fm which you might as well buy a fucking gold subscription at that point yeah
6131587	6133428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6147097	6153340	My thought is, this isn't... Now, my hope was that I'd be able to use Last.fm as my in-game music, but that's not really what they're going for, is it?
6153440	6156101	This is just going to be like a cable channel or something.
6156121	6156822	I guess, yeah.
6156842	6158002	Kind of like the cable music channel.
6158363	6160444	Instant Party just added Last.fm or something.
6160724	6161144	I don't know.
6161524	6163965	Like, I have yet to really hear, what is this used for?
6164666	6165046	I don't know.
6165406	6167867	I hope you can use it as in-game music, because that would be pretty cool.
6167887	6168608	That would be pretty cool.
6168628	6169208	That's what I was hoping for.
6169228	6173210	I was actually trying out the custom soundtracks with Fuel the other day.
6173430	6173830	Oh, me too.
6173990	6174190	Funny.
6174690	6174831	And...
6176338	6177738	Fuel doesn't have the greatest soundtrack.
6177778	6178339	It really doesn't.
6178839	6184700	It's got what I like to call sight truck syndrome, where you add new music to it and it instantly makes the game better.
6188241	6188621	I don't know.
6189021	6189821	It's alright.
6191642	6197143	See, I've never used Last.fm on PC, so I don't really know if it's something that I'd be really excited about, to be honest.
6197263	6205065	I mean, I like listening to new music and discovering new artists and stuff, but I don't think they have as eclectic taste as I would have, you know.
6206317	6206617	I don't know.
6207237	6209058	I guess I'll check it out because I am a gold member.
6209078	6212338	It's too bad it's not Live 365 instead of Last.fm.
6212398	6212978	I know, right?
6213018	6214819	I'm saying something nice about Live 365.
6215159	6220660	But seriously, we might almost consider going back if they could have that on Xbox Marketplace.
6220680	6222040	Hey, how about we do Shoutcast?
6222200	6222440	I know.
6222480	6222940	There you go.
6223080	6223900	How about Shoutcast?
6223940	6224400	Exactly.
6224480	6230521	Then you can have all games radio on there, which would include us, of course, and all the other great stations that come with Shoutcast.
6230561	6231242	But I don't know.
6231282	6232382	Maybe... And IRC.
6232422	6233622	Let's add IRC in there, too.
6234449	6235450	You won't need a PC.
6235510	6236410	You can just do it through the 360.
6236951	6237571	Exactly.
6238191	6239953	That's why I would love to have this show.
6240813	6245996	You can already hear it on your PSP, which is cool, but that's like one system out of a lot.
6246437	6249479	I guess that's one nice thing I could say about the PSP.
6251380	6253881	By the way, we wouldn't really go back to Life 365 chat.
6253961	6254562	Don't panic.
6254642	6255703	We're not really going to do that.
6256840	6258141	Besides, you know what's funny?
6258481	6269205	Is that since the show has actually kind of grown a little bit in numbers since we kind of combined with Bobby and we have some of the holdovers from his show and I know he gets a boost from us, I don't think we could do the show on Life 365 anymore without being a professional station.
6269225	6269926	We have too many people.
6270306	6278369	Which is a nice compliment, certainly, to the listeners and the fact that the show has grown and we're very thankful for that.
6278710	6281751	We actually could not afford to do this show on Life 365 anymore.
6282231	6283292	So, don't worry.
6283352	6284072	That's not happening.
6284112	6285172	I was just making a bad joke.
6285493	6285713	Sheesh.
6288716	6300989	Um, so what's kind of surprising is, um, to go off completely off topic from that, uh, Blizzard apparently is not going to be including, um, land support, of course, with, um,
6302490	6304131	StarCraft 2 Land Parties Land Party Centers
6325327	6329610	Well, I mean, they still have play over their Battle.net stuff, but I mean, it's not the same.
6329650	6333832	So you can still have a LAN party, it's just that you're all going to have to have an internet connection.
6334493	6334733	Yeah.
6334873	6340276	Which, in this Wi-Fi day and age, shouldn't be that difficult, but still, it is kind of crappy still.
6340336	6348661	I mean, if you think about it, there is more lag, I think, involved with that, because you're not just playing off of a local network, but...
6350768	6351869	I don't know, that kind of sucks.
6352029	6357374	But basically, Blizzard's responding to the whole removal of it because everyone was pissed off.
6358275	6368824	We don't currently plan to support land play in StarCraft 2 as we are building Battle.net to be the ideal destination for multiplayer gaming with StarCraft 2 and future Blizzard Entertainment Games.
6368964	6377852	While this was a difficult decision for us, we felt that moving away from land play and directing players to our upgraded Battle.net service was the best option to ensure that
6378172	6382136	A quality multiplayer experience with StarCraft 2 and safeguard against piracy.
6384819	6389584	SG100Mad in chat says, Hell, I'm having a party next week and we intend on playing Mass StarCraft via LAN.
6392771	6393911	Here's the thing, though.
6394111	6399134	It's not like you can't still get everyone in a room together and play this game together.
6399634	6402756	You just have to do it on the internet, which I know kind of sucks because it's different.
6402796	6405758	And they want to do that so that it validates your copy.
6405798	6406358	Exactly.
6407098	6407859	It's piracy.
6408059	6408919	Yeah, they're trying to curb piracy.
6408939	6415583	And someone's going to create a client that's going to act like Battle.net that you'll connect to that and you'll be able to play LAN with.
6415843	6416864	And guess who will be doing that?
6416964	6419305	The pirates because they'll figure out a way around this.
6420067	6420807	I kind of agree.
6420867	6422188	Blizzard ought to know better than this.
6423769	6426450	They're going to take it out and someone's going to find a way to put it back in.
6426750	6427270	You know what I mean?
6428571	6432712	They might as well just put it in there and just encourage people to buy the game legitimately.
6435086	6439950	Have one computer on the land sneak onto the internet and see if the other copies are validated.
6440030	6441431	Certainly there's a way this could be done.
6441992	6446976	Certainly, like, if one computer, like, creeps onto the internet, Battle.net could somehow kind of tell.
6447076	6447456	I don't know.
6447777	6448537	Maybe I'm just crazy.
6448557	6452721	And, of course, you know, everyone's pissed off, and what happens when people get pissed off?
6452761	6454002	They start a petition.
6455023	6457145	And so they have a petition created, um...
6458066	6458466	Thanks for watching!
6487918	6506220	because we did next question no they'll say blah blah blah well we think the marketplace is shifting and we just wanted to encourage folks to use Battle.net so that they could track their achievements and everything is statistic based and if we do the land then we can't have that you're going to get some talk around answer just wait yeah just wait
6507874	6534240	um let's talk a little bit about the Dreamcast yes Dreamcast is of course getting yet another game and much like the other you know new games for the Dreamcast that have been coming out recently is another shmup game uh the brand new 2D um shoot em up game named Dux D-U-X and it's actually um being sold I guess um right now for $27.90 um
6536380	6538642	I'm not sure if it's going to be a disc-based game or not.
6538682	6543725	I guess it could be, since, you know, Dreamcast can pretty much read any sort of burned disc.
6545466	6563559	And apparently, I guess, they have another game that's also coming out as well, the company Hucast, and it's... I guess the title is Last Hope Pink Bullets, which I guess was co-developed by The Shins.
6564300	6564560	Hmm.
6565601	6565781	Which...
6567492	6596549	I've not heard of any of these things apparently that's actually like the shins like the band the shins huh interesting incredibly but yeah I mean it's still nice to see I guess games coming out for the Dreamcast pretty cool alright well you know what guys I think it's time to get into the FUs of the week we wouldn't want to forget it this week so we gotta get into the FUs of the week and of course the story that inspires our angst this week
6612418	6612858	DarkSakura.com
6636345	6643072	So they stole this thing from the neighbor and then the parents, or the mom, I shouldn't say parents, the mom helped them sell it off at a local pawn shop.
6644053	6647196	It was being reported by WFTB in Orlando.
6647477	6653023	The Maxine Law will probably be charged with dealing in stolen property and contributing to the delinquency of minors.
6654284	6655926	You should know better, you stupid.
6657067	6657908	That makes me angry.
6657988	6658969	Loki, FU's the week.
6659897	6666563	I guess FU to not having enough time to play games and being broke, more or less.
6670025	6671587	I don't really have a lot of FUs this week.
6671667	6681334	I'm generally feeling pretty good, so I guess I would just also give an FU to not having enough hours in the day to play video games and FU to Facebook games for being so stupidly addicting.
6685658	6685898	All right.
6686348	6687709	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
6687869	6689129	We got release dates to get to, too.
6689149	6690990	We'll get to those in a little bit after another couple stories.
6691110	6692251	Let's talk about some free games.
6693051	6693511	Yay, free!
6693731	6694692	Yes, free is good.
6695132	6696733	And these are actually some pretty good free games.
6696833	6698433	Both happen to be fighting games.
6699194	6702395	The first one is a game called Vanguard Princess.
6703215	6708017	And I guess it's a 2D freeware fighter game developed by...
6709398	6710320	Thanks for watching!
6726365	6726865	www.vector.co.jp
6744186	6754191	DarkPresence is a digitized fighting game very similar to the old Mortal Kombat games.
6755172	6759894	So like Street Fighter, the movie, the game, where they actually captured the faces of people?
6759934	6761235	They're making a new game like this?
6761535	6761775	Yes.
6761815	6762976	That is freaking awesome.
6763276	6764556	And actually, I take that back.
6764596	6768679	This is not a free game, but apparently...
6770384	6771485	It's a new arcade game, isn't it?
6777881	6779942	Crappy, if it's an arcade game, I don't know.
6780222	6793106	Well, I was reading something about it's got more animation, I guess, than any game like it has ever existed, so it's supposed to be a smoother looking game than the Mortal Kombat games were, which I would hope, being that it's been many years, the technology hopefully has gotten a little better.
6793126	6805190	To me, it looks like one of those cheesy games that you would see in a movie or something like that when they're trying to create a game in the movie that's supposed to represent a Mortal Kombat type-ish game, something really low budget.
6806257	6807238	But hey, whatever.
6807498	6816022	If it comes out and turns out to be cool, hey, Mortal Kombat at the time, I think it looks sort of cheesy on a certain level, so more power to him.
6817743	6818043	Alright.
6818715	6820135	Let's get into the release dates, shall we?
6820155	6823436	We're going to travel around the world now and talk about what is coming out around the world.
6824136	6827257	We're going to start tonight with Japan since those are the release dates I have up right now.
6827957	6839980	Coming out in Japan on July the 9th, Major League Baseball 2009 comes to the Xbox 360 as well as WWE Legends of WrestleMania also making its way to the 360 this coming week on July the 9th.
6840640	6850084	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Siren gets a price drop into PlayStation 3's best series, as well as WWE Legends of WrestleMania also comes out on July the 9th.
6850825	6856227	Moving on to some other systems, we have on the Nintendo Wii, I believe, is next.
6857427	6859168	Nothing really coming out this week in Japan.
6859208	6866071	The next big release, Dragon Ball game coming out July 23rd, but it's a little quiet for Wii games right now, which is a little strange.
6866752	6867572	Usually they're still pretty busy.
6868152	6871454	Major League Baseball 2009 also makes its way to the PlayStation 2 this week.
6871954	6875837	Kind of not surprised, though, that a baseball release would be kind of the big thing in Japan this week.
6876757	6880940	You get some new peripherals for the DS, some Disney character headphones coming out.
6881320	6889245	But otherwise, there's really not a lot of new games coming out, but there is a price drop coming out on Hamster 2 Kuroso comes out.
6889765	6890446	I'm sorry, it doesn't come out.
6890466	6895009	It gets a price drop this week, which is this happy hamster-looking game.
6896110	6897951	This looks like Nintendogs, but it's hamsters.
6897971	6898972	They do look very cute, though.
6900314	6900434	Aww.
6901295	6902716	No sign of Richard Gere in the game, by the way.
6903617	6905539	And then let's see on the PSP.
6906520	6908402	Bleach gets a price reduction.
6908442	6908943	Heat the Soul 5.
6910204	6912566	Another port of Major League Baseball 2009 this week.
6913307	6918372	And, yeah, looks like this is a big week for baseball in Japan, but otherwise, nothing else to really note.
6919509	6920030	How about the US?
6920850	6923532	US, there isn't really a lot of stuff coming out this week.
6924553	6932298	Pretty much your big release is going to be the Bigs 2, which is coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and I believe the PSP.
6933900	6942886	Also this week, we've got, looks like, oh, the, this is a crappy game here.
6944527	6944667	Huh.
6944707	6944908	Huh.
6947639	6948520	I didn't see that on there.
6949021	6954890	Uh, Birthday Party Bash on the Wii, which, you know, apparently it's a birthday party kit in a box.
6956252	6958696	I don't know if you're a mom, maybe that might be interesting for you.
6959256	6961079	Throw little birthday parties for your kids.
6962161	6962281	Um,
6963883	6975832	Also this week we've got a port of a game that came out in the UK, Sid the Dummy, which is a Crash Dummy game, something that would have probably been popular like 20 years ago.
6977113	6979194	Coming out on PSP, PS2, and the Wii.
6979835	6985699	A re-release of Bioshock and Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, kind of combined together in the bundle for PC and Xbox 360.
6985739	6992264	The packaged version of Arma 2 coming out on PC, which is supposed to be pretty sweet.
6993671	7018606	Memento Mori on PC and then coming out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network this week Battlefield 1943 also on WiiWare this week and PC the first chapter of the new Tales of Monkey Island series Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 1 Launch of the Screaming Narwhal which sounds pretty cool and um
7020444	7023745	Also, I believe Trine is supposed to be coming out on PS3 as well.
7024006	7025966	Or on the PlayStation Network this week as well.
7027127	7028928	So not really a huge, huge week?
7030068	7030908	No, not really.
7031789	7035170	Next week... I mean, July is really slow for game releases.
7035230	7037731	I think next week we've got NCAA Football 2010.
7038912	7040973	So if you're into college football, that would be good for you.
7041013	7043854	But really not a lot of big stuff.
7043914	7045555	I think at the end of the month, of course, King of Fire is 12.
7045595	7046815	So that would be cool.
7046855	7048776	This time of year is usually a little slow, isn't it?
7049375	7050436	It's always slow this time of year
7078807	7079207	There you go.
7080088	7087213	A couple more stories, then we'll open up the Skype line for you guys at 1-877-GAME-OLR to take your calls tonight on anything you want to talk about.
7089794	7094717	Apparently, according to Sesame Street, video games are okay.
7095638	7096979	According to Sesame Street.
7097859	7104904	So as opposed to according to Joystick or Destructoid or Kotaku or one of the big game blogs this week, it's according to Sesame Street...
7105834	7106675	Yes, apparently.
7107035	7108136	I see.
7108877	7109197	Let's see.
7109237	7124953	Apparently, Game Changer, a report issued by Joan Gans Clooney Center from the Sesame Workshop, basically says that governments, the healthcare industry, and schools should be spending less time hating on video games and their negative efforts.
7126194	7154165	negative effects and said be conducting research on their positive effects on kids the report says that games not only can be educational but in this day and age active as well meaning they can be used everywhere from a history classroom to a PE class and of course you know they're also saying the Joan Ganz Clooney Center is to foster innovation and children's learning through digital media so that's their kind of did you hear that Jack Voldemort you listening
7156318	7158960	and yeah, that's kind of neat.
7159341	7161462	I hope we get a song about it that Elmo sings.
7162503	7165466	Video games are A-OK.
7166406	7168508	Just do your homework then you can play.
7170269	7174373	Hopefully Elmo will never have to explain to children what teabagging is in Halo.
7178055	7185182	There's some contest there in there that I want to do about who can write the best Sesame Street song for something obscene in gaming.
7186983	7187284	Nice.
7189346	7189986	Oh my gosh.
7190447	7193149	Gold Anthro in chat says, Another reason that Sesame Street is awesome.
7193209	7194971	First the death episode and now video games.
7194991	7196933	Kind of talking about something we talked about last week.
7199059	7204442	Hey, by the way, speaking of media, I don't know if you guys heard about this, but apparently they want to make a movie out of Asteroids.
7204802	7205663	Stop!
7205803	7212046	The old-ass fucking game from 1979 that many of you know from the Atari 2600, Asteroids.
7212486	7215848	Universal has somehow gotten the rights to make Asteroids.
7216669	7218510	Matthew Lopez is writing the script.
7218830	7223072	It's being produced by Lorenzo de Bonaventura, who I know produced some other stuff.
7224032	7224973	This is the weird thing.
7225053	7225553	Apparently...
7227415	7230018	Universal is making a lot of movies of some weird shit right now.
7230599	7235505	They have the rights to some Hasbro games like Battleship and Candyland are supposed to be coming movies as well.
7236758	7238840	Yeah, they picked up a lot of Hasbro stuff.
7239240	7241862	Oh, you know where I've heard Lorenzo de Bonaventura before?
7242122	7243083	He's producing that G.I.
7243123	7245064	Joe movie that's coming out next month.
7245104	7246145	That's a pretty big movie.
7246425	7248466	So it's not like these are no-name people behind this.
7248486	7251529	Well, it's a pretty big movie, but it's also going to be a pretty big flop.
7251909	7252709	You think so, huh?
7252789	7258854	But then again, Transformers has a lot of horrible things going for it, and it still did very well.
7258894	7259474	So who knows?
7260135	7260295	Hmm.
7261684	7262685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7278298	7279798	Where is the movie in the game?
7279918	7282579	I think it's not even going to have a damn thing to do with the game.
7282639	7284879	It's going to be a space movie called Asteroids.
7284999	7286900	Whoop-de-doo.
7286940	7291360	Oh my god, I shot the asteroid and it turned into two smaller asteroids.
7292041	7292461	Oh no.
7293781	7295621	Quick, shoot the UFO for bonus points.
7295741	7297842	It should be funnier for the space invaders.
7298162	7300362	TigerClaw on chat says there's already an Asteroids movie.
7300422	7302662	It's called Armageddon.
7302763	7304943	Armageddon is actually like 10 years old now, believe it or not.
7305674	7306615	It's kind of an old movie now.
7307035	7308156	It's time for an update.
7308236	7310617	Blow up the asteroid to make it multiple asteroids.
7311398	7311898	I guess that's true.
7312238	7315560	Please no dancing animal crackers in the Asteroids movie.
7315620	7316061	Please.
7316921	7317622	No Ben Affleck.
7317842	7320784	Thank you very much.
7320844	7321724	How many more stories do we have?
7321764	7323165	Maybe one more for the Skype line?
7323205	7323545	Two more?
7323665	7323946	I don't know.
7325026	7326627	Let's do one more.
7326647	7329069	Then we'll open up the Skype line if you want to fill time with other stories we can.
7329743	7331444	Okay, let's see.
7333704	7338626	Well, I'm not really sad about this, but apparently Neterozy is being shut down.
7339346	7342587	Sony is pulling the plug on the PlayStation 1 development community.
7343467	7347729	They're going to still keep all the libraries and stuff online, but I guess it's officially shut down.
7347769	7348469	But honestly...
7349229	7350090	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7369269	7370829	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
7370889	7374510	It's the guy on the east coast with the fastest trigger, Ranma Hi Ranma, how are you doing?
7398377	7399518	I'm pretty good, pretty good.
7399718	7400858	What cons did you go to this week?
7403499	7406441	As I said to Tiger Claw, I didn't go to any conventions this week.
7406561	7408381	I only do the ones that are on the East Coast.
7409242	7409582	I see.
7409622	7412363	And, of course, Anime Expo is the big deal on the West Coast this week.
7412383	7414544	Which, by the way, I should say something about this.
7414984	7422208	Our staffer, DJ Tyrant, Jimmy, who used to host a show on our old network with DMN.
7422248	7423508	It's Brest Lowell now.
7423808	7425869	They used to host a show together called STFU.
7425929	7427490	He writes for our website once in a while now.
7428150	7429851	AX is not a con, it's a trade show
7457085	7461168	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7479471	7481132	So it's not fan produced.
7481512	7482112	Pretty much.
7482152	7485293	That's why Fanime always kind of puts that big fan.
7485693	7490215	They really sell their thing on fan made, fan produced for the past so many years.
7490595	7494417	Yeah, most cons I've gone to, especially ones I've staffed, are mostly fan based.
7495277	7495517	Cool.
7495557	7496078	Well, that's cool.
7499399	7500019	Yeah.
7500339	7504801	Sorry, I would say all the good cons are fan based, but E3 is pretty awesome for a trade show.
7504901	7505901	So trade shows aren't all bad.
7506181	7506622	Anyway, sorry.
7506642	7506742	Oh, no.
7507947	7509288	Go ahead, what else did you want to call in about tonight?
7536704	7538827	But people bought it because the name IBM was on it.
7539107	7542451	But the only difference was, at the time, IBM made a good quality product.
7542912	7543873	Sony, not so much.
7544234	7545315	Sony is not Apple.
7545635	7546697	They need to realize that.
7547618	7548659	Apple can get away with that.
7548699	7549200	Sony can't.
7551255	7578523	I know because I don't know if you ever noticed if you ever pick up like the Best Buy flyers or when Circuit City was still around in their flyers they're always pushing the PS3s with the Sony televisions if you bought the Sony TV and the PS3 $200 instant savings or if you bought that with Rock Band or Guitar Hero World Tour you save $300 off the complete bundle it's gotten to the point where
7579409	7581532	Sony cannot sell the PS3 anymore.
7581732	7584916	In order for them to push them out, they gotta bundle it with something, you know?
7586116	7612461	I'm reading some interesting comments from chatroom chat.orangelaunchery.com Jrod in chat says I plan on buying a PSP Go on day one that thing looks pimp as hell don't get me wrong, I think the PSP Go looks pretty cool, but since I already have a PSP, there's just not enough in it for me, I don't know, I'm not feeling it for 200, I would be all over that fucking thing if it was like 150 even even 150, same price as the current PSP, I would be all over it but it's that 250 it's, ah, I can't do it, I'm sorry
7617586	7617827	Anyway.
7618487	7619167	I don't blame you.
7619187	7619887	Seriously, I don't.
7620928	7622069	Yeah, but you're a Sony hater.
7622169	7622669	No, I'm just kidding.
7623649	7624670	No, I just speak the truth.
7624730	7625230	You know that.
7625550	7626010	Alright, look.
7626050	7627811	Anything else before I let you go and get some more callers?
7628552	7629212	Two quick things.
7629252	7634374	Number one, if the Wii wasn't all about motion control, it would have a shit ton of shovelware games on it.
7634715	7638816	And as for StarCraft 2, you don't need... It does have a shit ton of shovelware games on it.
7638836	7639417	Where have you been?
7640456	7641677	And what was the other thing?
7661963	7664345	I'm all about StarCraft 2 not needing LAN support.
7664545	7671031	It doesn't cost that much to put in an internet connection, a router, and a 24-port switch to get everybody up and running together.
7673013	7675775	Do you think it's really going to have that same feeling, though?
7677296	7681740	Well, if they do it where you log in via the application, it shouldn't be that much of an issue.
7682401	7685964	Because you'll probably have the same lag time as if you're in the same room, you know?
7686304	7688606	It all depends on who's hosting and all that crap, you know?
7689372	7689692	I guess.
7690233	7690653	True, true.
7691193	7692434	Alright, well thanks for your thoughts, Ranma.
7692854	7693235	And good luck.
7693895	7694235	Later.
7695916	7698718	Jrod, I wanted to clarify what he was saying earlier.
7698738	7701760	He says, I don't own a PSP, so that's why it's probably so attractive to me.
7702241	7707024	Yeah, I'd probably be a little more about the PSP if I didn't already own one.
7707945	7708425	But still, $250?
7708885	7710867	I don't know.
7711627	7712528	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7712548	7712908	Who's this?
7715890	7716811	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7717111	7717371	Hello?
7717391	7717491	Hello?
7719835	7720416	Hi, who's this?
7721116	7723197	Hi, who is this?
7725478	7726299	Is this Marissa?
7728240	7729340	Hi, what's on your mind, Marissa?
7731582	7732522	Well, things are good.
7732542	7736064	I just had to say a belated congrats for last week.
7737125	7739546	I wasn't able to listen in, although I heard it was a good show.
7740515	7741435	It was a pretty good show.
7741475	7749398	It sadly hasn't hit the podcast feed because I'm a lazy son of a bitch, but it will be hitting it very soon, and you guys can hear it was a little bit of a throwback to the old days.
7749438	7749818	It was cool.
7751739	7760881	Yeah, you know, as far as my own gaming week, this Fourth of July weekend consisted of watching Chris play Call of Duty.
7762702	7763542	And how was that?
7763662	7765903	Is it fun to watch his play?
7769292	7770393	All the sounds of murder just make me tired.
7770413	7773816	So yeah, I've actually distracted myself with that old, you know, you're talking about people doing
7790117	7816409	Making games for Dreamcast and whatnot and old systems I distracted myself with that old adventure game engine And was playing that Alien Rape game Oh yeah, the one you linked me to That looked kind of freaky deaky But tell us a little bit about this game Yeah, actually I didn't get into it But I thought it was hilarious Like Alien Rape Escape or something Because you know me, I love all the old adventure games How do you feel about the new Monkey Island game coming out?
7818406	7819227	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7838288	7841631	I'm still obsessing over the announcement that we made that a new feast is going to come out.
7841691	7843632	But I have this praying every night that Eidos doesn't fuck it up.
7865990	7868371	Isn't that how it always goes with old franchises, though?
7868411	7871714	When they announce that there's a new one coming out, you just pray that they're not going to fuck it up?
7873695	7883962	Yeah, well, I guess the thing is, when I first took over for Looking Glass, although I actually liked the platform game, the Xbox game, Deadly Shadows, most of the purists didn't like it.
7884442	7891527	And it started out kind of lame because they called it Thief with a 4 instead of the I or something.
7891587	7892848	It's sort of lame like that.
7893800	7895722	So it's like Thor for something now.
7895762	7899425	I don't know how to pronounce it, but I guess it's just a working title.
7900525	7900926	Indeed.
7901326	7905590	Well, Marissa, you need to come visit us soon and come be on the show again.
7906090	7906991	I'm hoping that'll happen.
7907891	7910974	And you have anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight before we get to some more calls?
7912995	7915357	Nothing that wouldn't be so blindly silly.
7915898	7921122	So have a good night, and hopefully I'll be seeing you soon, and you need to call so-and-so.
7921362	7921642	All right.
7921682	7922243	Will do, honey.
7923638	7928843	Hi, this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator, what's on your mind tonight?
7952525	7955986	Two things which are kind of interrelated to some degree.
7956266	7958267	Go ahead.
7958387	7968111	I was thinking about the comment you were making about someone's making an Asteroids movie.
7968911	7969151	Yes.
7969211	7973732	My question is, how the hell do you make a movie on Asteroids?
7973772	7975333	There's like no narrative there.
7976293	7980975	I mean, I can see a movie being made of like
7981838	8009101	Uncharted or Metal Gear Solid there's a narrative there but easy the same way the same way dude they're making movies out of Battleship and Candyland they are movies in name only or Pirates of the Caribbean there was really no plot to it you know in the ride but they managed to make three movies and they actually were pretty good now Asteroid could be something similar where they just make up characters and then now those characters are associated with that franchise so
8009321	8037237	and maybe that's what they want to do maybe it's a type of agreement where if they do a good movie then they can re-release the asteroid game with the characters in it just like they ended up going back and putting the characters in the ride or more importantly had huge amounts of merchandising with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies Jack Sparrow figures still sell like crazy and you see tons of them at Halloween he's a universally loved character I guess that's a good point I didn't even think about if they do write the movie well enough
8037597	8038378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8060558	8072926	Sometimes, it's nice to have a very thin narrative, but I wouldn't, you know, my expectations for this movie are not going to be, I guess, that high because of the fact there's no narrative to base it off of, if that makes sense.
8073006	8073306	I don't know.
8074967	8079490	Well, it could very well be good, you know, for all I know.
8079510	8088036	Obviously, I haven't seen it, so I can't be sure, but, you know, I'm going to be a little skeptical, you know, to say the least.
8088513	8090193	Well, we should be skeptical.
8090213	8092534	It's $10.25 of our money we're going to be spending on the movies.
8093454	8095274	Anyway, what was the other thing you wanted to mention tonight?
8096835	8117419	Yeah, I forgot to mention it in my email because I can't really mention it or wrote it, but I happened to notice earlier this week that on the PlayStation Network store, they always have the video side, they got a reasonably new, or new for the store,
8118424	8122446	Enemy series that may be appealing to some of the listeners out there.
8122546	8125867	It's the Devil May Cry series.
8128328	8135810	And, well, I bought the first episode to try it out, and from what I'm seeing, it looks pretty good.
8136971	8143833	I don't know about the entire series as a whole, but just based on the first episode, it looks pretty good, so...
8145188	8152512	I don't know if any of the listeners want to check it out, or you guys, but at least the first ones are worth checking out.
8152812	8153332	Yeah, that's cool.
8172255	8182082	I think I mentioned in a previous email going back several weeks ago that I had recommended the Burst Angel anime series.
8182943	8189928	I happen to have all 24 episodes and at least that series is very good.
8190088	8192430	It's kind of hard to describe.
8192570	8198114	It's like a cross between certain elements of X-Files and
8198795	8201497	A little bit of Charlie's Angels mixed in.
8201698	8202659	Ah, Charlie's Angels.
8204300	8206802	Yeah, it's kind of odd, but in a good way.
8207663	8209725	Definitely worth checking out.
8209965	8211927	Is that available on Sony's Marketplace?
8213208	8214209	Yeah, it is.
8216991	8225979	It's put up, I think, I can't remember the name of the developer, but
8227307	8232110	It's not Funimation, that's for sure, but it's pretty good.
8232391	8235173	Alright, I will definitely have to check that out on the marketplace at some point.
8235193	8236694	But thank you so much for the call, Spazinator.
8236814	8237374	You have a good one.
8237394	8238355	We've got to get some more calls.
8238795	8239556	But you take care.
8241057	8241557	Yep, you too.
8241697	8242738	Later.
8242758	8245820	1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8245840	8248362	If you want to give us a call, take maybe one more call tonight.
8248382	8252105	I don't know if Loki has any other stories he wants to get out there before we take our last call.
8253205	8253866	Let's see here.
8255566	8255987	We got a call.
8256007	8256947	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8256967	8257308	Who's this?
8258829	8259769	Hi, this is X-Link.
8260190	8260790	Hi, X-Link.
8260810	8261450	What's on your mind, buddy?
8262051	8264573	Hey, I have a quick question for you guys.
8264633	8275820	How can a developer bring out a PC version of a game that's really great and really good but yet have so many buggy and radical issues it's not even funny to even start to mention how many stuff there is wrong with the game?
8276060	8278122	Are you saying it's a PC game that came out?
8278587	8280208	Yeah, Ghostbusters, a video game.
8280228	8283129	The PC version is absolutely horrid.
8283449	8293793	It is not, I mean, there's so many complaints from so many people, they're not even issuing any patches, or they're not issuing any kind of, you know, saying, hey, look, we're sorry, we're trying to get on this.
8294373	8298576	Super duper easy answer for you.
8298636	8310865	The one kind of problem that I suppose that PC games have in general is that there is not the same quality control that you have on the PlayStation or the Microsoft system or even the Nintendo system.
8311105	8314267	These games go through no quality control.
8315468	8319131	Remember way back when they used to have the Nintendo seal of quality?
8320270	8321451	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8342546	8343346	and so on and so forth.
8366738	8370219	You have to make sure everything is referred to by the proper name for it.
8370259	8372119	I mean, it's down to that kind of level of control.
8372499	8374840	On the PC, who's there to control those games?
8375260	8378961	What third-party entity has to look at those games and review them?
8379201	8379581	Nobody.
8380321	8381482	Nobody's really watching that.
8381842	8387663	I think it should be more reviewing done, because like I said before, I feel now I'm being kind of gypped out of my money for the game.
8387803	8391344	And I was literally looking actually forward to playing it on the PC, and it's like...
8392290	8400714	Now to go out and find a way of getting it for either the 360 now or the PS3 in full quality to play it until they come out with some kind of patch.
8400874	8408218	I mean, there's been more than one instance with more than one person saying, hey, look, there's these kind of problems.
8408238	8413961	I'm running it on a high-end system, and yet it's still running like it's on a 386 computer.
8414021	8415902	So it's like, what's going on here?
8416202	8418123	Interesting comment from Xenocore in the chat room.
8418163	8419384	I want to kind of run this by you.
8419904	8421086	Thank you for watching.
8421106	8421566	See you next time.
8436207	8441590	Good point is that, you know, when on the PlayStation, on the Xbox, at least you have the same hardware.
8441690	8445912	So there is something to kind of, but you don't know what components are going to go into those PC games.
8445952	8447153	So how can you really audit them?
8447513	8454376	I always thought that games for Windows was kind of one of those types of things, was a way to have the game's quality controlled.
8454756	8457017	But I guess he brings up a good point.
8457097	8459859	You can't really test every hardware combination out there.
8460860	8461561	Yeah, that's true.
8461781	8462782	That's very true.
8462822	8466848	And I just thought it was kind of weird because, like I said, I play Fallout 3 and everyone's perfect.
8467068	8468590	I have no problems or anything whatsoever.
8468610	8472075	I play this and it's like the whole thing is getting ready to crash at a given point.
8472635	8477141	I just thought it was kind of interesting.
8477201	8477442	I just...
8478018	8480541	Well, I'm sorry to hear the game runs like crap, X-Link.
8480581	8484206	I would still continue to pressure the developers professionally.
8484306	8486569	Write a letter, post on the forums, what have you.
8487049	8494459	Get the other people you know that have been having problems with the game to continue to hound them and say you're not going to support them in the future if they don't fix their crap.
8495549	8496109	Most definitely.
8496170	8496550	I hear you.
8497591	8497911	Excellent.
8497971	8499332	Good luck, buddy, and take care, okay?
8499492	8499792	Thank you.
8500213	8500593	No problem.
8500693	8500953	Bye-bye.
8501133	8501213	Bye.
8517648	8518028	Greg DeStefano
8539495	8553063	And you can look at the pictures that they have there on www.GregDeStefano.com That's G-R-E-G-D-E-S-T-E-F-A-N-O.com And they've got some pretty interesting pictures.
8555064	8557325	Sadly enough, that Icarus guy looks like Shane.
8557626	8558346	That's kind of funny.
8559607	8560687	Wait, let me see.
8561328	8561748	Sort of.
8561888	8563249	I don't know.
8565590	8567651	Maybe if Shane took hardcore drugs...
8570251	8570531	I don't know.
8571152	8573114	How about Wario's John Goodman?
8573715	8573815	Eh?
8574175	8574556	Sort of?
8574576	8575677	Okay, that I see a little more, yes.
8575697	8576098	Okay.
8576118	8576618	There you go.
8577119	8578420	But yeah, it's interesting.
8579061	8584947	And then other things, there's some cool rumors going on, including...
8586698	8588620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8604218	8630952	from Ghostbusters so it makes perfect sense that we'll probably be seeing some stuff pretty soon from that probably just costumes though the Hanabi Festival is coming back in Europe and there's actually a pretty good lineup of games coming with that including I saw they had Ogre Battle which is pretty cool Ogre Battle from the Super Nintendo Pulseman from the Sega Mega Drive Bomberman 94 on TurboGrafx-16
8634577	8656685	Detna Twinbee on also the TurboGrafx Kirby's Dream Land 3 on Super Nintendo Musha on Sega Mega Drive Smash Table Tennis on the NES and Zoda's Revenge Star Tropics 2 all these coming to Virtual Console during the month of July I guess that's kind of neat
8657225	8657946	StarTropics2
8681786	8695011	Konami, I guess, has also confirmed that they're going to be porting over Contra Rebirth for Europe in August and also Driftmania with two I's, also coming to WiiWare as well.
8695551	8696512	Drift!
8696912	8701874	Driftmania, I guess, that's how you pronounce that top-down racing game.
8702778	8703499	TMNT Smash-Up
8722020	8724924	Apparently, they're also going to be getting two Rabid characters.
8725144	8730931	One of them is rumored to be dressed up as Sam Fisher from, of course, the Splinter Cell series.
8731551	8734555	And then also Rabid dressed up as a cheerleader.
8735055	8741162	And those are supposed to be in the all-teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighting game, which is kind of interesting.
8741823	8743184	Link's Awakening Link's Awakening Link's Awakening
8764081	8768204	I remember this coming out and it's like, oh my god, Link's Awakening, we can play it on the TI-83.
8768544	8769485	But really?
8770686	8773488	Those little graphing calculators can handle all the processing?
8774208	8775429	Can you show me the video?
8775549	8778352	They can hack them so that it's an assembly and stuff.
8779993	8784837	I guess it's awful sound quality, but the graphics are just, it's okay.
8784857	8786117	The graphics are kind of crap.
8786458	8787499	Well, I mean, it's a graphing calculator.
8787519	8790801	And it's slow, but yeah, it's a graphing calculator running the game.
8790841	8791822	That's crazy.
8793050	8795754	I think that a lot of the stuff they probably just programmed from scratch.
8795774	8797296	I don't think it's actually being emulated.
8797456	8799639	Yeah, I can't imagine this is any fun to actually play.
8800120	8802203	This is just more of an accomplishment than anything else.
8803204	8805768	I remember back in the day it used to be...
8808228	8820313	This is back when they first started porting assembly stuff to the TI-85 and you can hack the calculator to run faster than it normally could and you could do grayscale games and stuff like that.
8821093	8821813	Ah, the days.
8821953	8826115	This is why I quit my calculus class because I was too busy programming games.
8826855	8827155	Nice.
8827715	8828456	But, yeah.
8831277	8832897	And that's all I have right now.
8833818	8834138	All right.
8834454	8835595	Wow, we're made it.
8835615	8836456	We're to the end of the show.
8836496	8839839	I know it's a little earlier than last week, but we're kind of at the end of the show.
8839879	8845284	And that's okay, because I don't know about you guys, but after this holiday weekend, I still have some things I'm trying to take care of before I go back to work tomorrow.
8846465	8848046	After this whole three-day work weekend.
8848747	8853291	So yeah, we're going to go ahead and wrap things up and get on out of here for the night.
8853991	8855452	Thank you guys so much for listening tonight.
8855992	8857793	Sadly, DarkSakura's not here either.
8857833	8861094	She'll usually help banter with us for a little while and bring her stories to the table.
8861114	8864235	She's not here, so I think it's going to be the end of the show, believe it or not.
8864275	8864676	We're done.
8864736	8866196	We're out of here.
8866276	8876621	Actually, it's good because it gives me a chance to make sure I can get on the network and get the files that I need to upload the show later this week because I don't want the podcast people to have to wait any longer.
8877677	8879338	We're out of here, believe it or not.
8879979	8880339	That's it.
8880679	8881600	Have a great night, everybody.
8882300	8884021	Let's get around to everybody's final thoughts.
8884162	8884962	Loki, your final thought.
8885142	8893488	My final thought is I'm watching and someone actually took a DS Lite and they've managed to turn it into an arcade cabinet.
8894189	8897451	Or I should say put a DS in an arcade cabinet.
8898456	8898956	That's crazy.
8899177	8899397	Wow.
8900037	8905302	My final thought is, instead of spending $400 on a laptop, I should have just bought myself an arcade cabinet for my house.
8905463	8906123	That would have been fun.
8906664	8907585	The room would have loved that.
8909567	8917994	You know, in hindsight, like I said, I think before, I'd rather have bought... See, because we were in an apartment complex, in order to have the whole thing delivered, it comes on a pallet.
8918095	8921478	And I mean, you can't deliver a pallet of stuff to an apartment complex.
8922349	8924651	You're going to get people looking at you funny.
8925512	8927174	But man, that would have been the way I would have gone.
8927194	8932699	It costs like a sixth of what I paid for it and just looks so much nicer.
8934997	8935578	That's it, guys.
8935598	8937479	Thank you so much for tuning into our show tonight.
