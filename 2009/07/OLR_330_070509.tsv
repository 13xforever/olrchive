23520	32760	emulation be coming back to the PlayStation 3 well hello everybody out
32760	36480	there on the internet and welcome to another week of orange lounge radio we
36480	40580	are that show dedicated to video games video gaming gaming culture and the
40580	45720	gamer lifestyle and with you as always my name here is Rob Roberts and I'm
45720	50560	always joined by well usually joined by two people but tonight only one tech
50560	54120	master Loki in the house hello how are you doing time has to Loki doing fine
54120	58280	dark Sakura the happiest bunny on the farm who was usually here to provide her
58280	62960	witty commentary in the classic game of the week she's out this week sadly she
62960	66040	is in Las Vegas so I guess it's really not that sad because I'm sure she's
66040	69440	having a great time in Vegas she's hanging out with one of our olr
69440	75280	staffers tiara our our our our our and I'm sure they're having fun being big
75280	79320	giggling girls and know that I always tease them about that but I know they're
79320	83240	having a good time nerding it up I'm sure if there was a Star Trek
83240	86880	experience I'm sure they'd be there right now but sadly it's closed but yes
86880	91520	so they reopened it they're going to reopen it soon but it's not open yet
91520	94800	especially you know the worst time to close it right before the movie comes
94800	99760	out I know I'm a potential bummer whoops well we still have you guys in our chat
99760	103480	room chat that orange launch radio.com I don't know I wonder if dark Sakura might
103480	106160	be listening and I think her and tiara just kind of hanging out tonight they're
106160	111360	just kind of away so if so I expect angry text messages they shouldn't be
111360	116360	listening they should be gambling and seeing shows and that's right go see
116360	120880	Cirque du Soleil other debauchery exactly well remember what happens in
120880	124960	Vegas stays in Vegas so but it's it's interesting though what you guys don't
124960	129280	understand is that we're still at her house the studio is still at it you know
129280	133960	studio dark Sakura so we're here in her house when she's not here which is a
133960	137920	little creepy but dance here you know Dan's entertaining company right now
137920	140800	they're watching a movie I couldn't figure out what it was these last star
140800	144380	fighter thing is what it is what's happened there was maybe it looks 80s
144380	149120	horrific and yeah but anyhow you know they're they're doing their thing so it
149120	152760	looks like there was a fourth of july bash going on here because you can see
152760	156200	all the fireworks out in the street all the residue how was your fourth of july
156200	160640	I didn't buy fireworks because in California the fireworks all suck here
160640	166400	they're they're getting more safe and sane as the time goes on so you buy you
166400	170600	know $100 for the fireworks and they last like five minutes because they're
170600	176420	crap and so being smart and you know just plain lazy and broke this year
176420	180360	decided you know I'm just not gonna buy fireworks so we decided to go down to
180360	186360	our local mall that was doing a fireworks show and so we went kind of
186360	193360	sat on my sister's apartment lawn and watched them from there so that was
193360	196960	alright you know it's like whatever which is funny cuz Loki and I were at
196960	200880	the same show last night except I was in the actual mall parking lot which is
200880	205680	funny this is the unplanned we were at the same place yeah so took us an hour
205680	210140	to get out of that goddamn lot three minutes for us you suck well we were
210140	215960	far enough away so yeah that's what we basically did and it was okay I mean
215960	220520	it's just I don't know it's fourth of July how many times do you have to hear
220520	223680	the same songs and the same fireworks although this year they did have
223680	228200	smiley-face fireworks so that was kind of neat you know innovating a little bit
228200	232040	but yeah that was alright and then actually it's kind of funny cuz normally
232040	237080	we used to go to like the Folsom rodeo just because they have fireworks there
237080	242980	as well and actually this year the night before because they do the rodeo like
242980	248400	for you know three days or so so they like the Friday Saturday Sunday or maybe
248400	253880	this year is Thursday Friday Saturday anyways so they had fireworks each night
253880	258440	and unfortunately the second night apparently there was an accident and one
258440	265080	of the mortars shot off into the crowd burning people so don't sad I miss that
265080	271800	so oh well but um yeah that's pretty much it isn't like final destination
271800	277000	where you had a premonition to not go to know if by premonition meaning that the
277000	283240	rodeo sucked every year then yeah I guess well we normally don't actually go
283240	288200	into the rodeo we just watch it from outside but and they would they started
288200	291160	figuring out the people are doing that so they shot they keep shooting the
291160	295680	fireworks even lower and I mean that's dangerous enough but you know because
295680	299720	they go hey you gotta come in the rodeo to see the fireworks you know so we're
299720	304400	gonna shoot them ten feet above everybody it's like come on but I know
304400	308200	well I reading our chat room at chat that orange laundry calm looking at some
308200	311040	of the commentary a tiger claws suggesting we need someone to make olr
311040	315000	fireworks fireworks that explode into the olr logo hey I'd be down for that
315000	318280	except they're private I love it dark Ted see this is why can't they play
318280	322640	America fuck yeah during a show I said the exact same so did I I said the
322640	325320	exact same thing last night were you listening to the whole simulcast they
325320	329680	didn't yes that was crap they're playing you know god bless the USA and all they
329680	332640	you know patriotic stuff I was like they need to just bust out with America fuck
332640	338000	yeah like really something like some good rock music or something it's always
338000	343840	the same like crap or you know Bruce Springsteen you know even really the
343840	350400	music I mean it was just kind of sort of you know it I don't know just I would go
350400	357280	to a fireworks show like that America fuck yeah and just that the biggest fire
357280	361200	you could possibly imagine well since I like fire a lot not only did I see the
361200	364800	fireworks by the way happy 4th of July to all the other American folks listen
364800	367840	to our program if you're not American well I hope you had a good weekend
367840	372040	nonetheless and you happy Canada Day to those our friends in Canada because that
372040	375080	was just this past week as well three days before ours exactly and you know
375080	378640	what it's not really I mean a lot of people I guess celebrate independence I
378640	382040	just celebrate the fact they get the light stuff on fire exactly that's all I
382040	386040	really celebrate but I think that's something that the whole world can
386040	389960	celebrate okay some of those safe insane fireworks though are a little crazy okay
389960	394280	because like okay we really like fire so not only do we go to the public fireworks
394280	397880	show but then we came back and let off some of our private stash and you know
397880	401280	Victoria Victoria was there and she had brought her 11 year old brother like
401280	405760	stepbrother or something came came with her and he's pretty cool like we were
405760	408680	talking video games and stuff he thought it was cool that I played Xbox and had a
408680	413200	show on the net and all that stuff and he likes video games and stuff I guess
413200	417320	him and Victoria actually bought at one of the safe and stay insane stands it's
417320	422000	called a bazooka and it is literally a firework that you sit on your shoulder
422000	426560	and you're like the fuse on the other end and it shoots off like a masses
426560	430240	amounts of color and sparks and I'm like okay wait a minute isn't this something
430240	433160	that you like sit on the ground and do this whole thing when they're like no
433160	436640	the lady at the thing told us that you you all put it on your side like a
436640	441480	bazooka or is this a video game show a super scope six it's super scope six of
441480	445080	fireworks you have to literally like put it on your shoulder okay like I thought
445080	448560	it was going to be a pathetic little display like a sparkler or something no
448560	452840	this thing was a like it didn't last very long it was only about like 30
452840	457780	seconds but it shot off like monsters of color and sparks like so much that the
457780	461600	kid got afraid and was started backing up a little bit and we were all actually
461600	464800	kind of like um this can't be good but he was like scared to hold it and all
464800	468520	this stuff we were like just you and Victoria was just like you fucking bought
468520	476560	it you fucking hold it this is great so you know teaching them young so yeah and
476560	480720	it was it was cool we set it off and it was it was it was very amusing at least
480720	484960	for those 30 seconds the other thing we did during 4th July is we were watching
484960	489480	Comedy Central all day where they had a marathon of like stand-up comedy which
489480	492760	is awesome so there's a bunch of comedians and they're like oh yeah
492760	497760	that's that guy that I wanted to see you know it's those pretty much it yeah we
497760	501120	don't have any unfortunately at our club we don't have cool things like Roman
501120	503720	candles here yeah he's asking if I'm talking about Roman candles no you don't
503720	506960	point this wasn't something you point upwards you hold it like a bazooka or a
506960	511620	super scope six and it shoots sideways but what's shooting out looks like the
511620	514720	type of thing you would see in a normal safe and sane firework I don't know how
514720	518960	to describe this for people not in California but like you know the just
518960	524120	the little sparks to go you know like the little little tiny flames of red
524120	527920	green yellow it's not what it used to be like sparklers don't really sparkle
527920	531000	anymore they're just kind of a little flame and yeah they look like colors
531000	535240	flames sparks coming out but you know we basically use the sparklers and I was
535240	541920	just like you know pucks and basically but yeah I mean I've seen my friend's
541920	548120	dad is a firefighter and or fire chief actually and he gets you know he
548120	552720	confiscates all the fireworks conference gates yeah unquote stashes
552720	555800	them for his own fireworks and my brother was a firefighter I know all
555800	560480	about confidence so they have you know they had like little boxes that are
560480	563920	mortars and stuff you know just like stuff that if you were in any other
563920	567920	state you'd probably be able to get and then of course every year their thing is
567920	573040	that they try to light off more and more ground flowers each year so like last
573040	579040	year I think they lit off like 400 ground flowers I mean it was the funniest
579040	582960	we saw it and now I have to describe for those don't know the ground flowers I
582960	586080	mean everybody's probably seen these even even in places where fireworks are
586080	589960	legal these things are cool like you light them and they go and they start
589960	593000	like red and then they turn green and they shake on the ground and spin around
593000	596840	you can't get those anymore huh did they finally ban them no I don't think so
596840	601000	really we didn't have any this year they're around okay yeah so they have
601000	606920	those and they try their thing was as a you know big group or party and stuff
606920	610240	they tried to light off more and more each year I think the year we went they
610240	615200	were doing like 250 I mean it's been getting more and more this was many
615200	619860	years ago but it was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen it literally was a
619860	624680	pile that they meticulously you know stacked up and you know tide fuses
624680	630940	together and all sorts of crazy stuff and it was the loudest buzzing just like
630940	637480	the whole street is just full of smoke and like lights in it it's so like
637480	641880	breathtaking you just can't stop you have to like bust out laughing because
641880	644960	it's the most ridiculous thing you've ever used wanted to cry it was so
644960	649540	amazing it was it was crazy I wish we had video of it but it's that sounds
649540	653320	like you know how like you'll spend like all day setting up dominoes for just
653320	657280	that one minute thrill when you knock them all over basically exactly what it
657280	663080	sounds like to me it's gotten so big now that like you know they literally have
663080	667720	like four or five piles of this stuff and it like by the time it's done it's
667720	672520	just like there's like a block radius of justice ground flowers just left it the
672520	680920	whole ground flower bomb pretty much it's awesome nice that's amazing a lot
680920	682240	of fun
682240	685720	alright well hey we're at we talked a lot about fire and fireworks and I'm
685720	689080	sure the kids love that but let's talk about video games a little bit with how
689080	690040	was your gaming week
690040	694400	Loki how was your gaming week I didn't play much I played of course the usual
694400	699160	hacked Grand Theft Auto 4 and yes I have people requesting you know that I play
699160	704640	with them and stuff online I can't play with you guys online because our new
704640	708720	systems are modded so we have a special version of it and it just wouldn't work
708720	713920	I mean we have items that I've created and who knows if it crashed the game if
713920	717600	I tried playing with you guys most likely you would have you be seen as
717600	720480	firing off all these crazy weapons and you wouldn't be able to do that because
720480	725040	it's just the way it works so you know not to and also the other thing our work
725040	728200	games we don't invite other people in it's just the four of us or three of us
728200	733160	or whoever's playing that's just the way it is but um so it's not hurt not that
733160	736240	I'm trying to ignore anybody I'm just saying that people have been asking me
736240	740320	to invite him it's just like yeah I can't do that so sorry
740320	744280	anyways so beyond that stuff it's just getting crazy just you just stuck up
744280	748440	just a minute you just stuck I'm not stuck up I play with other people but
748440	755840	um let's see here then also I've been playing I tried angry berry I finally
755840	759680	got to work I found out that it actually wasn't the game broken it was actually
759680	765920	our internet at work is kind of it's got a weird firewall on it they have us was
765920	772000	the 80s 86 3000 or something like that it's some weird web filter that they
772000	776440	have well they've only like unblock certain ports or something so for
776440	781880	whatever reason like we can play live but like the community game stuff
781880	785080	doesn't work because community games whether you guys know it or not you
785080	788040	actually have to be connected to live to use any of the community games even if
788040	791520	you bottom and they're on your system you have to connect to live in order for
791520	795120	it to work that's kind of like what happens with an Xbox Live arcade game if
795120	798520	you're not on your own console that you bought it on the air under your account
798520	803640	it'll kind of check live first exactly sounds like that but you know I these
803640	807680	are the consoles I bought it or it's the games I bought on this console so it's
807680	811560	kind of annoying so for you know I didn't realize this but at work I was
811560	815200	getting this weird error message and it's weird too because other community
815200	820280	games I've gotten have worked just fine but maybe I wasn't like maybe they
820280	823760	changed something or whatever because I played a carny vale and that was kind of
823760	829600	fun but anyways so angry berry for whatever reason didn't work at work but
829600	832920	then I tried it again at home I redownloaded and everything and it works
832920	836280	fine so I played a little bit of that and that game is absolutely crazy and
836280	840600	very very hard and just absolutely ridiculous with you know smashing old
840600	844400	women with buses and all sorts of crazy stuff we talked about this a few shows
844400	847080	back by the way if you have no idea what he's talking about yeah it's a fighting
847080	851200	game where you are Barack Obama yes you're very you're Barack Obama and it's
851200	855520	got it's got like all sorts of crazy like enemies and stuff and all sorts of
855520	860120	political references so it's great so definitely we're checking out things
860120	864040	only like 400 Microsoft points so I think it's worth that I would like to
864040	866960	see a game like this but with Sarah Palin I think it would be very funny
866960	869560	especially now that she's not going to be the governor of Alaska anymore if
869560	873000	you've been watching the news at all this week I you know what else is you
873000	877520	going to do in her spare time but save save the world from crime that would be
877520	883240	funny and then other than that I actually played some more fuel this week
883240	889000	and tried the online stuff you know there really is no one online I did see
889000	893000	Rob online but you know it just so happened like he'd be in a race when I
893000	896560	was doing the free mode and then I'd go into a race because he was you know in a
896560	899760	race and then he'd be doing free mode and it's just this wasn't working out
899760	903280	but I mean I don't even know how exactly that works if it's like fable to where
903280	906480	like I have to drive to your location actually find you I'm sure you do
906480	911560	because that would be annoying and I don't know where anybody is so oh well
911560	915520	but the game is fun and you know now that I figured out how to cheat and
915520	919080	teleport different spots on the map to get different vista points and stuff it
919080	922560	makes it nice and easy but there was funny though because the first section
922560	927200	of the game the first little region that you're in I didn't realize that I've
927200	930280	only done one page of the challenges I'm like what the hell oh why is this
930280	934200	challenge say I'm not done I'm like I've done all six of them I'm like oh there's
934200	941280	a page over whoops damn it so I went by the way that happens with races too in
941280	945400	the second area in tsunami zone or whatever it's called there's six races
945400	951320	not three so just watch out for that okay why can't we put more once you get
951320	955800	fooled I don't know why they did it that way but it's important and as the tsunami
955800	960600	reef or what I think it's what's called tsunami reef because those races not
960600	965560	only will unlock you get your challenge Doppler the livery Doppler but you also
965560	969840	get three cars that are new cars when you run into them you unlock a vehicle
969840	972600	so it's important to play all those races if you want to get all the
972600	976400	vehicles yeah I do because I'm actually tired of driving as the one side I did
976400	980400	all those unlock codes for different vehicles nice they're kind of it but I
980400	986000	like the clothing so I kept the clothing but um yeah it's so fun and actually you
986000	988740	know I really wish I had more time to play because I would be playing it a lot
988740	995520	more but I've been busy with that and other things yeah and still haven't got
995520	999200	a chance to play Wii Wii Sports Resort let me I get to this question from Jay
999200	1002240	rod in chat because you were talking about angry berry and it kind of brought
1002240	1005760	up community games Jay rod wants to know are those community games free to
1005760	1011180	download they're free to demo yes but they do cost money if you want to
1011180	1014520	actually buy the registered version it's just like Xbox Live Arcade so the
1014520	1017840	community games tend to be a lot cheaper and I mean the lowest price on the
1017840	1021640	community games 200 Microsoft points and another thing too I haven't really gotten
1021640	1027200	a chance to play around to get the new like kind of game making program kodu is
1027200	1031320	actually out now and 400 Microsoft points five bucks for a game that you
1031320	1034840	can make games in and send them to your friends and share stuff like that
1034840	1041560	excellent deal so definitely check that out very cool anything else for your
1041560	1044960	gaming week that's it you know I don't really have a lot to share with my
1044960	1047480	gaming week I haven't really played a whole lot of new games I'm almost
1047480	1051160	embarrassed to admit I've been playing a lot of Facebook games this week I know I
1051160	1055640	know I should hang my head in shame all the credibility I had as a gamer is kind
1055640	1059080	of shot but I don't know I've just been addicted to those crappy little Facebook
1059080	1061880	games I've been oh god I don't even know if I really want to admit this but I've
1061880	1067400	been playing one called sorority life sorority yes shut up it's like oh yeah I
1067400	1071640	did it's like something it's like mafia but it's a sorority fight it's something
1071640	1074720	my boyfriend got me hooked on but it's it's got all these little mini games to
1074720	1078840	like bejeweled and stuff I think here's what it is you know how I quit the MMOs
1078840	1084480	I think I have this inherent need to be leveling something like I'm leveling a
1084480	1088400	character in this stupid-ass sorority life game like all of three I don't know
1088400	1091200	I need to I do I need to go play something else like that but keep in
1091200	1095600	mind also I have a roommate so I can't have the TV whenever I want a period so
1095600	1098920	keep in mind that's a big reason why I don't always play like Xbox games and
1098920	1104160	you get a VGA cable for making for my monitor yeah I'm maybe I do maybe that
1104160	1107520	is something I did my computer all the time that's all I really play my 360
1107520	1110280	well here's something else I don't want to get teased too much I didn't play all
1110280	1113280	those Facebook games all week although I did play some more legitimate things
1113280	1117160	like bejeweled and text twist and they have UNO on Facebook now I don't know if
1117160	1120280	you're aware but they have UNO on Facebook that is similar to the Xbox
1120280	1124520	live one except you instead of seeing like webcams you're seeing people's
1124520	1127200	little Facebook icons and you're in a little chat room so you can actually
1127200	1132880	play UNO so you know I was checking a lot of that out this week but I also got
1132880	1136920	a new laptop this week fries on a really good deal on laptops this weekend
1136920	1140100	because it's 4th of July and all that stuff so I actually went and got a new
1140100	1145960	laptop it's a Toshiba so it's not a bad brand 2 gigahertz machine 3 gigs of RAM
1145960	1150400	separate video card inside it's not like an onboard video it's got a separated
1150400	1157240	video card $399.99 for his laptop I know it's a sweet deal but what's also sweet
1157240	1161080	about it here's where the rest of my gaming week comes into play because now
1161080	1164840	it's back to a 32-bit operating system since I don't have so much RAM or what
1164840	1169080	have you I can play game tap games again so I actually spent some time playing
1169080	1172520	civilization 4 because I missed it and that was one of the big games I would
1172520	1176640	play through game tap so I know I let out a lot of game tap hate on a previous
1176640	1180760	show because it would not work with my Windows Vista 64-bit but now I'm running
1180760	1185760	Windows 7 and yeah I installed the release candidate that we all got at e3
1185760	1189480	I decided you know what since I have a new laptop kind of like a fresh start
1189480	1194280	when better time to upgrade my OS so I upgraded to Windows 7 I haven't played
1194280	1197960	enough games on it yet I'm not familiar enough with the operating system yet I
1197960	1203320	do like it seems to be a faster version of Vista but without all the stuff that
1203320	1206920	made Vista so annoying like it's not asking me like 50 times I'm saying there
1206920	1210120	are you sure you want to install this so-and-so wants to access your computer
1210120	1214480	it's only done that when I've installed stuff otherwise it leaves me alone and
1214480	1218720	it's it's so much easier to turn off the warning messages and stuff so that was
1218720	1221960	one big improvement I noticed right off the bat I do think Windows 7 will be
1221960	1226120	better than Vista that's for sure better than XP I don't know still too
1226120	1229880	early to tell I do like though here's the one huge thing I noticed if I can
1229880	1234960	talk operating systems for a minute instead of having all your windows at
1234960	1238720	the bottom like you know how like right now you can see okay I have Firefox open
1238720	1242920	IRC Adobe Audition the mixer and all this stuff that you see there okay
1242920	1246280	instead of it that imagine that what would happen is that you'd see the
1246280	1250480	little icon in the quick launch bar that you had on XP and it's just like it's a
1250480	1253880	different color like the button looks raised because you have windows open and
1253880	1256960	then when you hover over the raised button you see little previews of all
1256960	1261040	the windows that's another huge change in Windows 7 so you save so much real
1261040	1264280	estate on the bottom of the screen with all your windows open at once that was
1264280	1268800	pretty cool so I'm noticing little things here and there but being able to
1268800	1272960	play all the old computer games I was missing from not having game tap work on
1272960	1276840	a newer OS was was kind of nice so that's cool I'm happy about that
1276840	1281040	rama in our chat room says Windows 7 release candidate will expire after a
1281040	1285000	year yes I'm aware that the two-hour shutdowns begin in March 2010 but look
1285000	1291280	that's March 2010 still a heck of a long ways away and apparently my laptop comes
1291280	1294240	with some type of free upgrade to Windows 7 anyway because I have like
1294240	1298000	Vista premium came with it I don't know they were telling me this at fries like
1298000	1302280	if I send them there is a thing that you can up it's it's gonna either be free or
1302280	1306480	a small fee I wouldn't even mind paying a small fee honestly but I you know if I
1306480	1310800	contact the manufacturer I has held on to my receipt so I can get the seven
1310800	1314960	free cuz I'm I'm sure I will prefer seven to Vista I can already tell I
1314960	1318360	prefer seven I just feel weird if I bought an operating system so I'm gonna
1318360	1322280	hold out for the pirated version look if your laptop comes with it for free I
1322280	1327600	mean oh yeah you know so I'm entitled to it right it's not a piracy thing it's it
1327600	1332240	came with my laptop no I'm thinking about my computer that's you so there
1332240	1335760	you go it's not that I don't want to pay for it it's just I don't want to pay for
1335760	1340160	it yeah Rama and chat says don't worry you get a free upgrade and let's see
1340160	1343960	Tiger class says the deals you see about home being 49 and professional being 99
1343960	1348120	it's for those about pcs with a Vista that's interesting because that means
1348120	1354600	that that means it's kind of like an apology for Windows Vista Rama and chat
1354600	1358240	goes on as of last Friday when you buy any computer you get a low cost or free
1358240	1361440	upgrade for seven that's awesome I picked a great time to upgrade didn't I
1361440	1367600	whoo nice so I was happy with my laptop purchase I'm telling you if you're in
1367600	1371000	the market for new computers right now that's a great time especially the
1371000	1373840	economy being the way it is and everything people or the you can find
1373840	1378800	some dirt cheap sales you know I've and I believe me I found those netbooks
1378800	1382760	tempting for like 200 250 dollars but seriously just spending another like
1382760	1388480	150 getting a nice nice system I'm very happy with my purchase and think about
1388480	1393360	it that is the cost of a PlayStation 3 and only 150 dollars more than the cost
1393360	1397800	of a PSP go I was listening to a old episode or a lot when I say old I mean
1397800	1401240	just a couple weeks old we were kind of in that debate about the PSP go and how
1401240	1404840	Sony is absolutely being idiotic with their price points it's what's killing
1404840	1409640	that generation 49 I mean the 249 can buy you a freaking laptop and we talk
1409640	1415040	about how you know PSP's are cool because they can do music and games and
1415040	1418320	you know kind of the thing all the things that a laptop can do well guess
1418320	1424720	what Sony a laptop costs as much as you're charging for your PSP go I this
1424720	1428880	whoever that was it's so frustrating because it's not that they're bad
1428880	1433400	systems it's just the Sony's getting it's just like when I remember the
1433400	1436960	PlayStation 3 everybody was like you know they're showing you know the system
1436960	1440400	everything and it was like yeah this looks awesome this is gonna be sweet you
1440400	1449720	know and then they're like oh and it's gonna be 599 you're like dah you stupid
1449720	1454120	you know what at least I'll give them the fact that they did have blu-ray
1454120	1457720	which at the time was an expensive technology it was fine yeah hella
1457720	1461680	fucking risky for them because at that time a winner had not been declared in
1461680	1466160	the HD DVD blu-ray war but to their credit and I'll give credit where
1466160	1469320	credits do I give Sony a hard time and I'll give them a good time when they do
1469320	1472920	things that are right they they were right they they were lucked out with
1472920	1475700	this blu-ray thing they want to say lucked out but they won out with this
1475700	1479600	blu-ray thing and that's gonna be a huge asset to them as this generation
1479600	1483360	continues I think you will see more people that decide oh I need to get a
1483360	1487360	blu-ray player why don't I just get a PlayStation 3 just like people said last
1487360	1489960	time I need to get a DVD player well I'll just get the PlayStation 2 because
1489960	1494760	it plays games you know my significant other has a PlayStation 2 doesn't play
1494760	1498720	like any video games on it uses it as a DVD player there are a lot of people out
1498720	1503760	there like that like that that will buy it as a player but kind of knowing
1503760	1506680	that oh well you know if I wanted to play games on it or had somebody
1506680	1509840	entertain I could it's good but see that's the thing though is that's good
1509840	1514440	to increase your install base but when you look at you know something like that
1514440	1519600	then think about all the people that did buy it for mainly a blu-ray player their
1519600	1524180	number is already you know for being in third place aren't that great and if you
1524180	1528260	take off you know X amount of percentage of that you know saying that these
1528260	1532520	people are only going to be using it for mainly a blu-ray player that's really
1532520	1536660	not good you know and they were kind of hoping that they would get a little bit
1536660	1541940	of a bump from you know people buying it as a cheap blu-ray player but it's not
1541940	1546440	working out for them Marissa con gusto and chat makes an interesting comment
1546440	1549720	chat that orange laundry calm if you want to join us live on this Sunday
1549720	1554060	evening as we tape at all games calm Marissa says I was talking about the
1554060	1557800	economy with new game prices the other day with a friend the prices have gone
1557800	1562760	down over the years recollecting that if a new game was $60 in 1993 for me but I
1562760	1565820	still wonder if the new titles can command the same opening price with the
1565820	1570080	unemployment rate skyrocketing well and somebody followed up in chat with Sony
1570080	1575420	sure hope so I to some extent they do say that even in a recession people will
1575420	1579600	not neglect their entertainment I mean look at movies transformers did
1579600	1583820	extraordinarily well at the box office even with the fact that tickets cost
1583820	1588480	like 1025 a pop now me movies are freaking expensive but transformers had
1588480	1591680	what the second best weekend only to the dark night I mean it's still huge
1591680	1595320	business you know it's there's a lot of freaking money a lot of people want to
1595320	1598100	see a movie a lot of people aren't willing to sacrifice you know
1598100	1601280	entertainment I mean they've made cuts throughout their life you know in
1601280	1605880	different aspects of everything and they want a little bit of a kind of a treat
1605880	1610400	for themselves for you know cutting to suffer yeah pretty much yeah I mean and
1610400	1613960	you know they can still afford to go to movies it's just you know what you got
1613960	1617000	to be smarter about if you really want to pay you know they go see a movie
1617000	1620840	don't buy the popcorn and soda there go see a matinee there you go you save
1620840	1625280	yourself a ton of money because it's just that the you know concession prices
1625280	1629360	are so expensive and the movie prices are pretty or go to the drive-in damn oh
1629360	1632720	yeah and save it the drive-in with the double features and bring it in your own
1632720	1638000	crap in the backseat and everything and hell yeah yeah the pride I'm surprised
1638000	1641360	the drive-ins do not thrive in an economy like this well you notice
1641360	1644720	member they are talking about closing the drive-in that we have in Sacramento
1644720	1647760	here for a while I always do they are every year they're talking about oh
1647760	1652840	they're talking about let's put in a 25 screen theater well because they could
1652840	1656120	charge more exactly that doesn't mean they'll have the business for fixing the
1656120	1659600	drive-in charge more for that charge a little more anyway sorry we're getting a
1659600	1664600	little bit off topic but let's see alpha kenanagram and Chad is hoping
1664600	1668640	believing the Ars Technica mole is right about the ps3 price drop in ps3 slim
1668640	1673360	since a lot of great 80 gigabyte bundles are going to sell with Wally LBP a
1673360	1677720	little big planet bundle and Metal Gear Solid 4 Killzone 2 bundle I don't know I
1677720	1680360	guess we'll get into some of the Sony news in just a little bit here when we
1680360	1684000	get into the news tonight but I I wanted to say though quickly about Sony and the
1684000	1688200	PSP go I think whereas people are willing to make sacrifices to their
1688200	1693760	entertainment there's a limit and I predict as I'm sure many of you do but I
1693760	1698440	I'm willing to kind of put it all out there I fully predict the PSP go is
1698440	1703800	going to tank and I'm not talking about like not not it's not just going to not
1703800	1708040	sell it's going to not sell horrifically like it is going to be an embarrassment
1708040	1712160	to Sony as I would predict the PSP go and it's all based off that price point
1712160	1715200	because when you put one of those puppies on the shelf next to a Nintendo
1715200	1721960	DSi that's only or an iPhone 40 or an iPhone that's $99 I'm sorry what does
1721960	1726840	Sony have to justify that PSP go with not a lot and I'm sorry fanboys I know
1726840	1730560	you got your games and I know you got your multi stuff that you can do in
1730560	1735000	there I'm sorry it is not just now they did say and then you know I know this
1735000	1738160	doesn't justify anything they did say that the processor is going to be four
1738160	1743880	times you know it's going to be a little bit faster so would be the average gamer
1743880	1747320	does not give two shits I didn't say they're not going to sell any of those
1747320	1751000	things well yeah there's plenty of Sony fanboys that'll be forking over the
1751000	1754720	money but it's going to be an embarrassment they're going to have to
1754720	1758200	cut the price and make they're going to have to that they will there will be
1758200	1763800	damage control by the even once it seems to be out like August October well then
1763800	1767200	by then they won't do they won't be able to fix it in time for this year's
1767200	1771440	holidays but next next year for the holidays it's going to be a well
1771440	1775160	especially you know they've got you know the PSP 3000 still out there now if you
1775160	1779960	really want to PSP you know if you think about it huh let's see here I can buy
1779960	1786920	this PSP system that's $100 cheaper and you know get 16 gigabytes of storage or
1786920	1792280	whatever for that for probably a lot less than $100 so there you go you save
1792280	1797720	money right there amazed at suman chat asks sky tank worse than the GBA micro
1797720	1801920	I think actually that's not a bad comparison because that was a dumb idea
1801920	1805680	to you know I think it was one of those things is like oh how cute you know
1805680	1810120	little tiny gameboy but like in practicalness you know come on those GBA
1810120	1813200	micros are a little silly I think this is actually worse because the reason why
1813200	1818000	is you're you're basically saying to your retailers okay you need to sell
1818000	1822040	these and the retailers are going well why because then this is basically a
1822040	1825700	system that you can only download games for it and you're not letting me sell
1825700	1829200	Neil vouchers for these games and stuff so why should I push your product and
1829200	1832520	that's really what's come down to it like I have some my cell through stores
1832520	1836120	that I deal with they're like I'll bring in a couple because people are going to
1836120	1839600	want them but that's it I'm not going to you know push these things at all
1839600	1846880	because why should I they're cut into my sales yeah I this is just going to be an
1846880	1850160	embarrassment it's going to set digital distribution for games back a couple
1850160	1853640	years single-handedly because then Sony's going to blame it on that that
1853640	1856360	people aren't ready for digital distribution no blame it on your price
1856360	1861800	and the fact that it's a system without a UMD drive should be cheaper see what
1861800	1867280	happened with the price you know before with the PlayStation 3 hello come on I
1867280	1871360	mean did you not learn from that at all I want to spend this whole show bitching
1871360	1874200	about Sony's price point because we've done it before but it's just it's just
1874200	1879520	frustrating as somebody who who wants to see the good in Sony and wants to see a
1879520	1883480	lot of the good stuff they have on the horizon to just watch them literally
1883480	1888480	literally take out a gun pointed at their foot and pull the trigger to watch
1888480	1893000	them literally do this in front of our eyes is frustrating as a gamer I'm sorry
1893000	1899120	as someone who tries very hard to see the good in Sony yeah anyhow let's get
1899120	1902600	into some gaming news I don't really have a lot for housekeeping tonight
1902600	1908000	visit us on Twitter at olr send us emails at mailbag orange laundry calm etc
1908000	1914000	etc Loki go ahead yes so actually I was gonna say you know we can talk a little
1914000	1918360	bit about those bundles that they had there's actually two different bundles
1918360	1921440	that are available now for a gig system which is kind of funny because they're
1921440	1925080	like kind of clearing them out you know because everybody thinks oh they're
1925080	1928400	gonna come out with some new 160 gig systems or something like that that
1928400	1935680	kind of goes back into what the Ars Technica mole said that the like a
1935680	1943000	slimmer ps3 will be coming out actually as soon as August and there's a Taiwanese
1943000	1949640	firm that said they've been awarded the manufacturing contracts for this ps3
1949640	1955880	slim system and apparently you know Engadget Chinese they reported that the
1955880	1959840	two Taiwanese manufacturing companies have been awarded contracts to build
1959840	1966440	Sony's new streamlined ps3 and according to udn.com half the orders have gone to
1966440	1973080	Taiwanese group Foxconn and the other half have gone to pigotron wasn't a
1973080	1976640	Taiwanese lawyer that tried to cease and desist the early images of the ps3
1976640	1984520	box to yes it was and apparently you know these were the manufacturers that
1984520	1991560	have I think manufactured the original ps3 so it makes sense and you know they
1991560	1995200	also said that the timing makes sense the rumor that it's gonna be released
1995200	2001200	in August because in Japan they actually have more console sales during the
2001200	2006480	summer as opposed to you know the holiday season for you know us in the
2006480	2011920	United States and Canada so you know it makes sense maybe that they're trying to
2011920	2015680	sell off all these you know ps3 80 gig systems to kind of clean out their
2015680	2020400	inventory and they're doing these kind of bundles to you know push out some
2020400	2025760	more systems to kind of make space for this new system which who knows maybe
2025760	2031960	going into our next story you know with the whole emulation thing so tell us a
2031960	2034520	little more about the emulation thing then so if you're gonna if you're gonna
2034520	2037880	open that worms let's talk about it definitely I mean if you think about okay
2037880	2042800	why would I need a ps3 you know slim system when I have you know ps3 well
2042800	2048160	there's rumors now that they may be you know bringing back the emulation this is
2048160	2054240	coming from the fact that there has been a new patent filed I guess back in
2054240	2059960	December you know I'm talking about full emulation of the emotion engine and the
2059960	2064440	motion engine was the chipset that they had in the PlayStation 2 it's basically
2064440	2069560	what you had in the no launch ps3 systems that allowed you to play the
2069560	2075000	PlayStation 2 games and then of course they took out one of those two chips
2075000	2079320	for the 80 gig system that was with Metal Gear Solid 4 and they were doing
2079320	2082440	some of that with software emulation then later on they took out all the
2082440	2088160	chips and so now you know you have no emulation but you know like they did
2088160	2092000	with the PlayStation 1 PlayStation 1 is completely you know software emulated
2092000	2096960	and you can play your discs and you can download PlayStation 1 games so you
2096960	2100080	better believe it that they're probably gonna have PlayStation 2 game downloads
2100080	2103880	here's my thing though are they really gonna you know patches in allow
2103880	2107000	everybody to play their PlayStation 2 games or are they just gonna really
2107000	2112040	strictly leave this as software emulation for the titles that are
2112040	2115880	downloaded so that you have to buy your games again do they want to piss me off
2115880	2121400	or not is basically the question that's out on the table I would hope if the
2121400	2124560	emulation is being built in there to play these old games and put them out
2124560	2127880	there on the service which makes a lot of sense as to why why now why this is
2127880	2132000	happening especially with digital distribution being so big maybe the PSP
2132000	2135440	go will leave because if this thing has a faster processor right you said the
2135440	2138840	process for maybe these PSP goes are gonna be armed to play the PlayStation
2138840	2143080	it's not gonna work because the the patents actually for the cell processor
2143080	2147600	to interpret okay so it's never mind you know unless they're shoving the micro
2147600	2151640	cell processor in the PSP go which not gonna happen all right so that train to
2151640	2155760	rail never mind so but if they're gonna do this whole thing with you know the
2155760	2161240	PlayStation 3 it's obvious that they could easily open it up so that image
2161240	2164640	is just like PlayStation 1 I can put a PlayStation 1 disk in my PlayStation 3
2164640	2167760	and play it there's no I mean people forget it is backwards compatible
2167760	2173400	PlayStation 1 but just not PlayStation 2 which you know is is noticeably missing
2173400	2176640	from the newer models anyway which I think most people have I don't have a
2176640	2180440	model I think play the old stuff see that's the thing it's like how greedy
2180440	2183920	are they is what might the real question that we need to be asking them because
2183920	2188280	they want the PlayStation 2 this still sell well they dropped it down to $99
2188280	2191520	and they still care about that system because it's still selling pretty well
2191520	2198240	sometimes outselling the PlayStation 3 but are they going to be greedy enough
2198240	2202040	to wear that when this does come out this you know if they do happen to
2202040	2206840	release this you are they going to do it as a you know patch where it will allow
2206840	2210080	you to play any PlayStation 2 game I think that would be good that would
2210080	2212960	probably get a lot of their you know people that are pissed off at them off
2212960	2218200	their backs and look really good in like a PR standpoint but if they are super
2218200	2222000	greedy they may also say hey we're just gonna limited this to you know the games
2222000	2225680	that you have to download so you have to rebuy the games you know because people
2225680	2229960	like buying games from us and we can sell them I think that they should
2229960	2232960	release it as a patch so that you can play whatever games you have because you
2232960	2236560	know what people are still gonna buy the games and you especially games that they
2236560	2239500	can't find anymore can you imagine downloading the original you know
2239500	2244360	katamari or something like that I mean that'd be fun very interesting comment
2244360	2247440	in the chat here at chat dot orange hundred dot com from game guru what do
2247440	2252040	you think of this Loki I think Sony has to kill the PlayStation 2 and get the
2252040	2256400	PlayStation 2 owners to move on that also makes sense because I think a lot
2256400	2259600	of people are clinging to the PlayStation 2 and are upgrading well
2259600	2264880	sure you put a $99 system next to a $399 system and people are you know the
2264880	2268260	average consumer again that's just looking for something to entertain their
2268260	2273000	9 and 10 year old is gonna go for the $99 system and also a lot of people are
2273000	2275960	upgrading because they're a law I have all these PlayStation 2 games you know I
2275960	2279720	don't want to buy a new system and not be able to play them which I never
2279720	2282440	understood that argument the first place if you're buying a new system you still
2282440	2285760	have your old system you can still play your old games it's not like that all
2285760	2290600	sudden your new old system is just gonna vanish you know it's not gonna you know
2290600	2294680	incinerate oh speaking as someone who stopped playing PlayStation 2 games on
2294680	2299720	the PlayStation 3 came out a lot of times it's about space wires and just
2299720	2305600	the convenience of it convenience is huge and to me owning a Wii and Xbox 360
2305600	2310160	and a PlayStation 3 there's a lot of fucking cords behind my TV and it's a
2310160	2313560	bit of a mess with all the different controllers all the different cables all
2313560	2316960	the different shit I mean and then add into that rock band instruments and so
2316960	2320520	forth my roommate probably just looks at this and goes my god this is so much
2320520	2325080	shit you know he's kind of right and to throw into that oh now I'm gonna I want
2325080	2328600	to whip out the PlayStation 2 and hook that up to and play that you know it's a
2328600	2333200	lot you know but here we are in the house of dark soccer and Dan they have
2333200	2336280	all these old systems they do whip them out once in a while and play all the old
2336280	2339740	stuff but I think it takes a certain type of gamer for that again the average
2339740	2345360	consumer I think gets annoyed with all the stuff to hook up yeah you know
2345360	2350080	there's people keep this in mind guys you know I realize as gamers who
2350080	2353360	probably download this podcast interested in the hardcore stuff there's
2353360	2356560	a lot of people out there who don't even know how to hook this shit up to their
2356560	2361160	TV they have to call somebody over to explain you maybe you've been called
2361160	2364880	before think about it haven't you ever been called to install something like
2364880	2370480	this like a VCR a DVD player a PlayStation onto somebody's TV or had to
2370480	2373360	fix it because they didn't like a wire came out they didn't know what happened
2373360	2377040	there's a lot of people that don't understand that stuff and the other
2377040	2383160	thing too though it's kind of I mean presumptuous of them to assume that
2383160	2388080	everybody that has a PlayStation 2 is gonna upgrade to a PlayStation 3 I think
2388080	2391200	a lot of people have gotten tired of their shit and I've already upgraded to
2391200	2395440	a Wii or well it's not really an upgrade but you know have gotten a Wii or have
2395440	2399600	upgraded to like a 360 or something like that and you know I was one of those
2399600	2403960	people I hated the Xbox fucking hated it I was very clear in the show that I
2403960	2410080	absolutely Sony fanboy 100% me too and then when the Xbox 360 came out it was
2410080	2414720	like okay well I'll get this in you know a PlayStation 3 later on but you know
2414720	2419160	then PlayStation 3 came out and I was like I'm not paying $600 for this
2419160	2424480	luckily you know I I go on for free so I didn't have to do that but you know if I
2424480	2429680	didn't get for free I would not be buying it so I mean it's just it's
2429680	2434080	really you know in Microsoft's really changed the way I think about them
2434080	2437640	because you know with the Xbox is just like oh my god the system's huge it's
2437640	2442360	like Microsoft learned from their mistakes Microsoft said oh okay you know
2442360	2445360	we didn't cater enough to the role-playing game fans we didn't care
2445360	2449320	enough to some of these audiences we were the casual gamer we're gonna try
2449320	2452240	and fix those things didn't happen overnight but you really see that stuff
2452240	2456440	starting to come together with a 360 Sony sat on their butt rested on their
2456440	2459760	laurels a little bit and thought people were gonna pay a premium price because
2459760	2462560	of blu-ray and all this stuff and they wouldn't really have to work into these
2462560	2465200	features and now they're kind of having paying for it a little bit trying to
2465200	2468040	play a little bit of catch-up which you know they're doing to make success
2468040	2472880	Nintendo fucking smoked weed and made the system that came to them in their
2472880	2476380	dream I don't know what they did but whatever they did worked like his
2476380	2480280	Nintendo just woo the Wii was kind of an outer space remember we all first heard
2480280	2484080	of that we were like fuck is this they redesigned the GameCube and made it you
2484080	2489360	know with some wireless controllers is basically it you know more or less so I
2489360	2494600	don't know yeah I'd be interested to see what happens but I have a feeling if
2494600	2496840	there is going to be any sort of software emulation we're gonna see it
2496840	2502120	probably by this fall j-rod interesting comments in chat here j-rod says I used
2502120	2506080	to be all about my 360 but with Microsoft's piss-poor hardware quality
2506080	2510440	I've moved on to a PlayStation 3 Rama says Microsoft doesn't have piss poor
2510440	2514800	hardware quality they jumped the gun to beat Sony and I kind of agree with both
2514800	2518280	of those comments that yeah you definitely noticed that the Microsoft
2518280	2523240	has the harder higher hardware issue and honestly that system as a piece of
2523240	2531720	hardware loud obnoxious not the most attractive thing in my living room but I
2531720	2536680	deal with it because of all the things it provides that make sense I you know
2536680	2542200	it's not actually for me the audio and the sound you know portion of this you
2542200	2545260	know system as far as how loud is and stuff doesn't really bother me I have a
2545260	2551000	computer that has countless amount of fans on it it's super loud and I really
2551000	2555440	don't care I just don't even notice it anymore just totally tune it out but yes
2555440	2562200	the yes the PlayStation 3 is immensely quiet you know compared to the 360
2562200	2568160	definitely all right well let's move on to some more news and I think we'll
2568160	2572240	continue talking about Sony news I want to talk about this some bundles and I
2572240	2575720	think this to come up a little earlier a chatter I had mentioned this but I did
2575720	2578320	just kind of want to reference this it was something we wanted to go over
2578320	2583440	tonight is that there there does appear to be some new Sony bundles on the way
2583440	2587440	apparently a Best Buy employee tipped off some of the blogs this week that
2587440	2591640	there is an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 out there now it has copies of Metal
2591640	2596680	Gear Solid 4 and Killzone 2 with it all for $400 so that's not too bad
2596680	2602560	considering you're getting two big games there for $400 also apparently now I
2602560	2606320	guess rumors are saying is that there's going to be another bundle that could
2606320	2610240	have LittleBigPlanet I guess with it as well. Yeah they do have it there's one I
2610240	2614480	think they do have it for LittleBigPlanet and WALL-E. The Blu-ray
2614480	2618240	interesting that's especially interesting considering WALL-E isn't a
2618240	2622600	Sony movie it's a Disney movie that's a that's a little weird to me you would
2622600	2625960	think they would throw in a Sony movie why a kung fu panda or something well
2625960	2629640	that's not so what I understand the need that you know they're obviously they're
2629640	2633280	going for the family system but it's very interesting that it's a Disney
2633280	2637720	movie like that sounds more like something Costco would do you know Costco
2637720	2640360	bundles all this stuff together they don't need the manufacturer to do it
2640360	2645440	very interesting but yeah those are some bundles I guess out there in the wild so
2645440	2650080	they are trying to add more value to the PlayStation 3 so you know it's getting
2650080	2657000	to be a little more reasonable. Definitely something that's not quite
2657000	2662760	reasonable it's a little weird is GameStop they've had some they have three
2662760	2668000	bundles that they have available as part of their Wii summer fun bundles and it's
2668000	2674120	almost like a bad joke they literally have if you buy one of these bottles you
2674120	2681060	can get a Wii bundled with a squirt gun, a Wii bundled with rubber duckies, or a Wii
2681060	2689040	bundled with pirate tattoo arm sleeves. Why? I don't know but these are crappy
2689040	2692440	little carnival gifts they're just throwing in with the Wii is that is that
2692440	2695560	really going to motivate someone to go get Nintendo Wii? Oh I want to get the
2695560	2699800	rubber ducky! It's absolutely crap because if you think about it I mean
2699800	2706600	these are like dollar store toys I mean why would it's like oh you know I got to
2706600	2714600	get a free water gun I mean it's a cheap ass water gun and you know that's the kind of
2714600	2718280	thing now with like GameStop and you know a lot of these places you know a
2718280	2721400	lot of people are like my customers I deal with you know bitching about
2721400	2726360	GameStop having the exclusives for you know different content and stuff
2726360	2730400	unlockables you know exclusive things like for example in the conduit they had
2730400	2736180	you know the all-seeing eye was blue in the game that's it it just happened to
2736180	2743160	be blue who cares you know it's like big whoop and this is kind of more like that
2743160	2747480	it's like okay where the hell did you get these free water pistols for and why
2747480	2751480	would you you know even think about bundling them with the Wii I mean why
2751480	2759200	even bother it's just crap but I don't know huh I guess they're trying to give
2759200	2763120	some added value to this but I'm not so sure value at all it's like take a dump
2763120	2766840	and put it in a bag and throw it in there you worth more than that stuff I
2766840	2771440	mean seriously it's just what the hell do you thinking the only thing it did
2771440	2775240	successfully do for them is getting people to talk about on blogs and on
2775240	2780920	this show because it's you know so asinine but that's not a positive that's
2780920	2784240	not gonna make anybody go hey I want to go purchase that GameStop because they
2784240	2790240	get crap with it I again I'm gonna go back to the Costco example Costco will
2790240	2793920	bundle in useful things with these systems like a free game or something
2793920	2796720	but now it's free sometimes you're paying a little more money you know the
2796720	2799920	extra controller but you want to go bundles Costco is a good place to go
2799920	2803840	there are some games out there they're absolute shit that seriously they could
2803840	2809120	probably purchase for really really cheap and they could throw that in there
2809120	2813680	and that would at least be something because it's least a game I can play
2813680	2818120	with you know the Wii whereas pirate tattoo sleeves I have no idea what the
2818120	2824080	hell I would use that for to be a pirate are alpha-kin anagram and chat says Rob
2824080	2828120	you would probably be a great voice actor that's like my fucking dream job
2828120	2832400	don't even joke I would love to do if there's anybody out there possibly at a
2832400	2837560	game company that is creating a game you need cheap voice acting I will I would
2837560	2841600	I will willingly be a voice actor in the game that's like my dream to do voice I
2841600	2846480	don't even care it could be like rubber ducky hunter 2009 I'll still do the
2846480	2853560	voice acting because I think that would be awesome so yeah it sounds like could
2853560	2859720	be an interesting bundle I guess for me for crap lovers a nice try there but I
2859720	2862800	think you're gonna need to like me I'll do something else too
2862800	2868600	Oh Shermy wants to get out you might know hey Shermy Oh Shermy the cat has
2868600	2875960	been hiding and I think sure me wants to get out but now sure he's afraid live on
2875960	2880760	air radio these these things happen we have cat drama going on I think sure
2880760	2883160	he's afraid now we'll just keep moving just leave the door open for a little
2883160	2889160	bit hopefully it's sure me old sneak out when we're not looking I don't really
2889160	2891760	have anything else I want to get into right this second well more stories yeah
2891760	2896080	sure well since we're talking about the we you might not even have to buy a we
2896080	2899640	because apparently the emulators for the we have been doing a pretty good job
2899640	2905760	themselves in fact the dolphin emulator which salsa does the GameCube games as
2905760	2911760	well has now gotten you know some games playable and also you know coming out in
2911760	2917480	720 or 1080p so they're able to render the games a lot higher so that kind of
2917480	2924560	gives you you know 16 16 times anti aliasing and they also had some other
2924560	2927920	filters that are thrown on top of there but it kind of gives you an impression
2927920	2932040	of what the we would look like if they came out with a we HD and honestly that
2932040	2935480	kind of has me kind of excited for like a we HD if they were ever to do that
2935480	2939840	because some of these games don't look bad actually rendered you know at a
2939840	2944480	higher resolution and granted some textures are kind of I don't know low
2944480	2949800	whereas but you know like mad world looks sweet super mario galaxy looks
2949800	2955000	pretty awesome they had some other videos I saw of punch-out look pretty
2955000	2960640	sweet but yeah there's a whole bunch of these and actually the emulator course
2960640	2964840	is available now and you can check it out wait you can actually doubt that you
2964840	2969520	could just put the we DVDs in your computer and play these games um I'm not
2969520	2972760	sure if it reads it actually off the disk I'm not sure if you need like an ISO
2972760	2976840	or something like that but I do know that it does support the we remote and
2976840	2981040	none check if you happen to have like a Bluetooth adapter huh and this is just
2981040	2985600	out there now it's out there now yeah and and the thing is endos not like
2985600	2989840	worried about this and you also need a pretty I mean you need a decent computer
2989840	2995200	to run it I mean granted your laptop would probably run this pretty well but
2995200	2997320	like some of the ones that they're showing I think they're like 4 gig
2997320	3002960	processors you know with 4 gigs of RAM you know pretty nice you know new
3002960	3008080	graphics card and that kind of thing but still though I mean that's you know it
3008080	3012400	leaves the door open because if you can emulate this stuff on a PC why not you
3012400	3017000	know what is Shermey doing sure he's finding other places to hide I don't
3017000	3022480	know just go outside kitty yeah you want to say hi to the listener
3022480	3032840	Shermey no comment comment that's a resounding no nice sorry I didn't mean to
3032840	3036240	let the kitty bring the show to a screeching halt but yeah this this is
3036240	3041640	only slightly bothersome I would think for you know Nintendo that that somebody
3041640	3045280	is actually doing HD was this a YouTube out there so YouTube they've got a whole
3045280	3049520	bunch of these actually on this is a brawl that they have done on there but I
3049520	3054000	mean it looks like nice it looks pretty cool yeah it does look pretty nice but
3054000	3058680	yeah it's do some searches online for we emailers there's actually a guy who does
3058680	3062040	our reviews of the emulators and the games and how they play in there and
3062040	3072560	stuff like that I want to say let's see here I think it's um Raini Bara Hona is
3072560	3081120	the user on YouTube re ne ba ra ho na and he has a bunch of different videos
3081120	3085080	actually watched the Metroid Prime 3 corruption one earlier but he has
3085080	3088520	reviews I think I think he's the one that's doing the reviews on him let me
3088520	3091640	get some comments from chat real quick because game guru wants to clarify PCs
3091640	3094920	can't read Nintendo optical discs so I was a little crazy there with that
3094920	3100120	comment but also tells me that Nintendo could get 720p with a firmware update to
3100120	3103920	use those four unused connections I don't know I mean keep in mind these
3103920	3109160	emulators are running off computer hardware and a Wii is running off the
3109160	3113320	hardware of two game cubes maybe it can't just simply run this with a
3113320	3116000	firmware update or I would have hoped they would have done it a long time ago
3116000	3121720	I don't know yeah I don't know either do you think Nintendo should be worried
3121720	3124320	about something like this I mean the fact that their system is being
3124320	3129520	emulated while it is still out there and some might say better than the actual
3129520	3132880	system itself they should be worried if it's actually because there are some
3132880	3137640	minor texture problems and stuff like that like there'll be some textures that
3137640	3141520	are supposed to be more transparent that aren't appearing transparent or like a
3141520	3145720	few little issues but they're definitely playable so they should be worried if
3145720	3150040	it's able to you know do that stuff and you don't necessarily need a you know we
3150040	3152880	remote and nunchuck to play this you can actually lose with keyboard and mouse
3152880	3156720	you know using the mouse as the Wii pointer or whatever and you know the
3156720	3163360	keyboard as your joysticks or whatever so yeah I guess you know I would
3163360	3166160	actually like to play a lot more of these things on here and you check them
3166160	3170840	out see what the games look like because you know mad world look really sweet it
3170840	3175280	kind of makes me wish they'd poured into the 360 or something and all they're
3175280	3179160	doing is they're just smoothing the textures basically they're in the 16
3179160	3183520	16 times it's not like it was going back to reprogram these things or anything or
3183520	3187640	any more work went into them or anything like that no not really and because the
3187640	3192200	reason this was actually I mean this is the dolphin emulator was for the Game
3192200	3196280	Cube and they just modified it to work with the Wii when the Wii came out
3196280	3201600	because it's basically GameCube hardware and you know almost the same type of
3201600	3207000	instruction set so I don't know I mean it's just you know goes to show you that
3207000	3212440	the Wii is really you know very similar to a GameCube and kind of wish that they
3212440	3215680	would do like a Wii HD because at the same time here's what they could do with
3215680	3219760	their games they could upscale all the games that you have come out and they
3219760	3223520	could you do some new or higher def games or something like that or you can
3223520	3227040	spend the money and just get a new an upscaler for your you know home
3227040	3233840	entertainment system and you can just do the same thing with Wii so well
3233840	3237600	apparently there is a new Final Fantasy game on the way and it looks like this
3237600	3241680	game is being made for the DS it was actually teased around there on the
3241680	3245880	internet and then Famitsu I don't think actually no I'm sorry it came from jump
3245880	3249920	magazine I believe is the the magazine that finally spilled the details on this
3249920	3255760	it's Final Fantasy Gaiden it's a new kind of Final Fantasy RPG for the DS it
3255760	3259680	looks a lot like the Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4 remakes that have
3259680	3264520	happened recently but it's kind of a new story apparently it's about a boy who
3264520	3267960	must rescue a princess from a witch your very typical kind of Final Fantasy
3267960	3272040	sounding storyline their typical fantasy story although I'm sure the end of the
3272040	3275600	world will somehow be worked into it as well the battle system is of course the
3275600	3279480	one you all know and love the turn-based menu system there's apparently though
3279480	3284600	now action points when you see your status you also have yellow dots that go
3284600	3289120	with that and the actions that you want to do also have dots next to it that
3289120	3292600	indicate how much it's going to cost so think of it sounds to me like it's not
3292600	3297200	magic points but like fighting points a little different they're gonna be coming
3297200	3303000	out in the u.s. actually I'm sorry it's gonna come out in the fall in Japan that
3303000	3306200	would mean probably next year in the u.s. once they get it all translated it
3306200	3311240	sounds right yeah there you go lots of fun Final Fantasy stuff I was bringing
3311240	3315600	up here real quick I want to show you mad world running on the emulator and
3315600	3318960	this actually should post this link in chat a chat that I was ready to call
3318960	3325320	just of how sharp the game looks I mean cuz mad world it's all black and white
3325320	3329240	and the line art and stuff like that you can see how it looks a little foggy
3329240	3332800	right there that's you know the one of the problems with the emulator at least
3332800	3337680	in this game but I mean look at how sharp everything looks it's just awesome
3337680	3342400	very that is pretty neat you should share that in chat if definitely you
3342400	3345560	haven't already chat dot orange launch rated calm that does look pretty nice
3345560	3353320	yeah um let's see some other stuff we can talk about here we'll probably do
3353320	3357040	one more story and then we'll get into the classic game of the week and part B
3357040	3360560	of our show coming up a little later as well as your phone calls one eight seven
3360560	3364240	seven game olr will open up the phones a little later on in the program well
3364240	3368080	Nintendo might not be too worried about some games at least you know in this
3368080	3373520	emulator Wii Sports Resort in Japan just came out what last week and already
3373520	3381400	they've sold over 350,000 copies I'm actually selling it's the third fastest
3381400	3385920	selling we title ever and it's moved three hundred fifty three thousand eight
3385920	3392440	hundred and twenty seven copies as of June 30th so by now who knows but it's
3392440	3396360	gonna be selling I think pretty well and who knows when it hits the US I know
3396360	3400680	this thing's been selling like hotcakes already so I actually don't think you'll
3400680	3404400	see the impressive day one numbers that you're seeing over in Japan I don't
3404400	3408080	think the US audience especially those that are huge in the week are that as
3408080	3413280	tuned in to you know when games are coming out and you know we were much
3413280	3416160	more tuned in in our culture to win movies are coming out like you probably
3416160	3419720	know what movies are opening up this week and actually I don't think most
3419720	3424120	casual gamers and non hardcore gamers are as tuned in with the release dates
3424120	3427600	so I don't think you'll see this have the same type of day one sales here but
3427600	3432120	I think you'll see it grow quickly yeah definitely and I think a lot of you know
3432120	3436280	casual gamers obviously probably be picking this up for like Christmas or
3436280	3440360	you know the holidays there's a long period of time you know period of time
3440360	3445240	and I mean look at like Mario Kart Wii it still sells really well only you
3445240	3449600	know mark no Mario Party 8 that stuff sells really well it's just a lot of
3449600	3455000	these games are just evergreen will sell for the life of the system so I could
3455000	3459240	definitely see this lasting a long time and it probably will end up selling
3459240	3463840	quite a bit and it could also be like we play whereas people bought this you know
3463840	3467400	they could be buying this for we motion plus you know save some money that way
3467400	3471600	and they get a game with it so I could definitely see something like that
3471600	3475480	happening yeah I just don't think you know I think when it comes out here
3475480	3479080	you're gonna see I bet you that first week oh I didn't sell nearly as well in
3479080	3484240	the u.s. is it in Japan oh my gosh it's it's a failure for Nintendo mmm give it
3484240	3489040	a couple months give it a couple months for the hardcore gamers who still love
3489040	3492760	a Nintendo to pick it up and then their friends to see it and then their friends
3492760	3495960	to see it and then CNN to do a news story on it and then Oprah to have it on
3495960	3500560	her show give it some time wrong wrong it will not be Oprah having in our show
3500560	3504800	it'll be Ellen DeGeneres because she likes hey Ellen Ellen has a very high
3504800	3509920	rated show don't don't hate don't hate on Ellen I'm just saying Oprah's not
3509920	3516000	she's more tech retarded as I'd like to put I don't know if I should admit that
3516000	3519480	I was watching Oprah but I was I was changing the channels and landed on
3519480	3524040	Oprah one day this is a couple months ago she had Facebook on her show they
3524040	3526880	were talking they were doing I know Oprah I guess has this thing where she
3526880	3530600	rips off the view now where she actually has a panelist of people on some some
3530600	3533920	days of the week I don't know but she had the dude from Facebook they're
3533920	3537640	talking about the business and I guess that was the same day that Oprah was
3537640	3541640	launching her own Facebook account or official Facebook or something it was
3541640	3545240	just like Twitter when she had Twitter on her show that site blew up remember
3545240	3549520	that yeah when they announced the official Oprah Twitter don't
3549520	3555000	underestimate the power of Oprah some might say that was the day the Twitter
3555000	3561880	jumped the shark to j-rod says people scream failure if it doesn't sell a
3561880	3565320	million in its first week remember how little big planet was a failure yeah I
3565320	3569120	mean I would actually agree with you the little big planet not only is it one of
3569120	3573800	the best games on PlayStation 3 right now period if not the best in some
3573800	3578560	circles but I think that's still a game that sells fairly well I don't know
3578560	3582840	PlayStation 3 figures that well but I have to be a consistent seller too I
3582840	3587400	don't think it's really like tapered off horrifically or anything I think you
3587400	3590440	know I don't think you can really compare Sony sales figures to Nintendo
3590440	3593800	sales figures I think horribly underrated underappreciated and it's
3593800	3597440	gonna be one of those games like katamari was where is horribly
3597440	3601720	underrated underappreciated and you know granted we all as game fans might
3601720	3606640	appreciate it and understand how awesome it is but the casual gamer they don't
3606640	3610080	understand it and you know it's sad because I think if you put it in the
3610080	3613320	hands of like someone that is more of a casual gamer and they actually played it
3613320	3616640	they would probably think it's really cool but then again there's some people
3616640	3620400	there's like oh my god controllers oh I can't I can't I can't do that although
3620400	3624400	really the only you know stuff in little big planet is run jump and occasionally
3624400	3627680	grab yeah but you have to understand these are the same people that can't
3627680	3632120	hook up their damn game systems it's all color-coded true true yellow the yellow
3632120	3640760	I mean it's matching matching colors can you not understand that I guess not some
3640760	3644280	people can't some people can't all right should we get into the classic game of
3644280	3648120	the week I think we shall did you want to say one more one more thing real
3648120	3653400	quick is really quick go electroplankton is coming to DSI where in Japan only and
3653400	3660440	of course it will be sold for oh that's a ripoff anyways it's picking their
3660440	3664240	their breaking up electroplankton because it was 10 different little
3664240	3669720	programs that you can make music with they're breaking them all up individually
3669720	3675680	the 200 Nintendo points each so $20 total seemed kind of a ripoff if you
3675680	3679180	ask me but I think that's what the game originally sold for I was to say you had
3679180	3682740	to originally buy like it was weird they didn't even market this game big time
3682740	3686040	you had to buy it through Nintendo site you can even get in stores remember yeah
3686040	3691980	and having played electroplankton I don't get what the point is I mean it
3691980	3697120	was it was neat for a second and then I put it down and never touches again so I
3697120	3702180	can't recommend buying this but hey if you're in Japan and you want to waste
3702180	3707640	you know some points there you go all right we are gonna get into the classic
3707640	3710760	game of the week we like to take a few moments here at the end of part a every
3710760	3714680	week to reflect on gaming's history and some of the games that helped bring the
3714680	3718640	games we have today out there usually dark Sakura goes through her archives
3718640	3722100	and picks a classic game of the week but since she's not here tonight the one and
3722100	3726800	only Loki it's his turn to replace her with his entry into the classic game of
3726800	3732480	the week and I believe he has picked a doozy this week so Loki what is the
3732480	3735160	classic game of the week this week classic game of the week has been a
3735160	3740100	game that I've wasted countless hours on one of my favorite games has been on
3740100	3746040	every Nintendo system it would be Mario Kart not a Super Mario Kart Super Mario
3746040	3752040	Kart yes careful well I like Mario Kart in general but Mario Kart one started
3752040	3759720	all on the Super Nintendo came out in 1992 wow that was a long time ago and
3759720	3770040	did quite well sold you know I think eight million copies worldwide and was
3770040	3776840	the I think number two title for the super NES really yeah wow that must be
3776840	3783720	only behind what Mario World even though that was the pack-in game I think so Wow
3786720	3791920	Mario World actually was it I take it back it was not number two is number
3791920	3798320	three but hey it's close enough I mean don't keep on country also I want to
3798320	3802320	point out Game Guru and chat says Mario Kart wasn't on the NES or Game Boy true
3802320	3805360	but they still called it Super Mario Kart the name of this game is Super Mario
3805360	3812200	Mario Kart yes Super Mario Kart was one of those mode seven games you race
3812200	3816840	around on kind of a flat track but of course you have little blocks and stuff
3816840	3820240	that made the course and everything they had a bunch of different theme levels
3820240	3826760	including you know the booze mansion and well they weren't really a mansion it
3826760	3831560	was kind of like Doc's almost like dark place but a Bowser's castle of course
3831560	3835720	they had the mushroom cup shell cup flower cup banana cup and you had
3835720	3841840	unlocked you know each of the I think it'd be golden those in order to unlock
3841840	3845080	the rest of the cup and of course who would forget you know who could forget
3845080	3850680	the special cup that they had there with Rainbow Road which is awesome Rainbow
3850680	3859200	Road was sweet and but the thing that I spent the most time on and oh so many
3859200	3865520	hours lost to this versus mode versus in battle mode you know we played battle
3865520	3869320	mode forever and battle mode of course you the object of the game was to pop
3869320	3876000	the other carts three balloons and you know we've wasted so much time doing
3876000	3879920	that but you'd have different shells of course the green shell was kind of
3879920	3884120	dumbfire shell that you'd shoot straight ahead you've got red shell which you
3884120	3889200	know is kind of a homing missile almost your bananas they drop behind you to you
3889200	3895520	know get out the other player also you know your mushrooms for boosts and in
3895520	3899200	the original game actually they had the feather that you get they could jump and
3899200	3903840	that was handy for jumping walls or jumping the shortcuts and stuff like
3903840	3908920	that of course later on they had more sequels for the game on practically
3908920	3914600	every Nintendo system is actually on every Nintendo system and they even made
3914600	3921640	its debut in the arcade with two arcade games Mario Kart arcade GP and GP to
3921640	3926600	the first one of course I am famous for playing drunk during my bachelor party
3926600	3931200	and which by far orange launch radios most viewed YouTube clip and I don't
3931200	3936360	remember much of it but I'm actually did play it later on it was all right and
3936360	3942160	it's not the same it doesn't have the same charm no it doesn't but uh you know
3942160	3946880	of course the original Super Mario Kart game had quite a few characters in there
3946880	3950480	you know they had some unlockable characters as well but the starting
3950480	3957680	lineup of course yet Bowser Luigi Mario peach Toad and Yoshi and you can also
3957680	3965400	unlock don't come junior and Koopa Koopa and of course the little trick is you
3965400	3979200	can shrink those down as well and yeah pretty much it and it also actually made
3979200	3983520	its way to the Guinness Book World Records gamers edition 2008 which goes
3983520	3987900	to show you that they will put pretty much anything in this book but it was
3987900	3992960	awarded the first console kart racing game and best-selling a handheld racing
3992960	3997920	game course cuz you know was it really that yes it was really the first kart
3997920	4001960	racing game interesting I wonder what they got the idea for this
4001960	4007320	they actually fact-checked that stuff that seems awfully weird I don't doubt
4007320	4011080	that it's true I mean I can't think of another one that there was but it's just
4011080	4013280	kind of interesting
4013280	4016280	yeah
4016280	4021920	but uh yeah I mean lots of fun and you know of course my car we came out last
4021920	4027400	year still pretty fun but you know it just doesn't have a charm I think of an
4027400	4030840	original Mario Kart game which is available for virtual console download I
4030840	4037600	believe remember correctly is this a good one it is I know Mario Kart 64 is I
4037600	4040720	don't know about the classic though really I don't think the classic one is
4040720	4044840	still up surprise surprise to it maybe it is and I just missed it amongst all
4044840	4047440	the other crap that they put out honestly I haven't downloaded anything
4047440	4054240	in person for a long time so it's been mainly we were this was my college dorm
4054240	4058320	years by the way do you know what the epic battles we had on this game in my
4058320	4063440	college dorm and this is probably about 96 or 97 or so I remember when the
4063440	4068320	people upstairs got a Nintendo 64 and got Mario Kart 64 oh my god that was
4068320	4075800	before I was not as big of a fan of 64 as I was this one but it was you know
4075800	4079160	still really fun to play and I think I just this one is kind of one of those
4079160	4083600	like you know sentimental type games for the love of God Nintendo when you put
4083600	4086680	out a new Mario Kart game and I know how you like doing classic tracks and stuff
4086680	4093320	is it gonna really kill you to not you know include all of the old battle
4093320	4096320	courses or something like that they always seem to find the ones that like
4096320	4100800	nobody played and let's just like bring that one back it's it's like come on
4100800	4103840	well dude in that new one they had battle course 4 and that was the one we

4177320	4181200	remember Orange Lounge Radio was its own station now is at this point many years
4181200	4184240	ago I don't even remember when we pulled the plug on live 365 but it was a while
4184240	4188000	ago now it's about a year and a half ago so we've been at all games radio ever
4188000	4191800	since our our new home where we were syndicated for a while and now we're
4191800	4195280	somewhat of an all-games exclusive but of course you can always get the podcast
4195280	4199960	when I'm able to get it up to date and I apologize again that I'm not always
4199960	4204760	current but I try to be please no it's not a anti podcast thing I promise
4204760	4209080	anyway part B here we go we're gonna get to your mailbag and the FUs of the week
4209080	4211880	and the release dates we got all sorts of stuff we should go still get a cover
4211880	4216240	I'm sure though Loki has a little few more news stories for us I have tons of
4216240	4221160	news stories and let's talk about a music game because that's what's awesome
4221160	4226240	DJ Hero announced of course that they're gonna be I should say Activision
4226240	4231600	announced the DJ Hero would contain Grandmaster Flash and not only will he
4231600	4236200	be appearing in the game as himself and you know among the cast of other DJs
4236200	4241720	that are in the game but he'll also be contributing to songs including one
4241720	4248920	remix as Herbie Hancock rocket versus nerds lap dance and then also Grand
4248920	4255840	Master Flash here comes my DJ and versus Gary Newman cars I'm all about DJ Hero I
4255840	4261080	think this game looks awesome yes yes it looks really sweet I'm not surprised
4261080	4264840	though that they're including the old you know some of the old the some of the
4264840	4267960	deep famous DJ is kind of like they do in guitar here all right you have like
4267960	4271480	slash shows up and you know buckethead and some of these people so it's pretty
4271480	4277720	cool yeah so I'm very cool and you know just excited that we're gonna we're
4277720	4283480	hearing more songs coming out of it um what else was I wanted to say about DJ
4283480	4286960	Hero it's still gonna be extensive though of course is the only kind of
4286960	4290680	outside but what do you do but the thing is though is it's the only game I'm
4290680	4295360	buying this fall really out of all the stuff coming out this fall silly game
4295360	4300720	I'm buying this fall because you can't pirate the the turntable I see how you
4300720	4306200	know it really deserves my money but um yeah it's just you know with kids coming
4306200	4311320	you know really honestly I mean piracy aside you know I'm probably not gonna
4311320	4315160	be playing a lot of games in the fall we'll be playing the grant of thought oh
4315160	4320320	expansion a new one but that's for sure but really with kids coming is just like
4320320	4326360	I'll be lucky to play DJ Hero I hope we get DJ Samantha Ronson in the game though
4326360	4329480	so we can have her girlfriend Lindsay Lohan or on again off again girlfriend
4329480	4336920	make a cameo pretty awesome I think so yeah but is she any good has she
4336920	4341640	actually made music I think she's a somewhat respected DJ I think it's more
4341640	4345120	than just who her girlfriend is Sacramento not that long ago they were
4345120	4351240	promoting it on the radio I don't know I had there's a lot joking I don't think
4351240	4355520	she's a long list of other DJs I'd rather see in the game than her fine fine
4355520	4360360	I try to make a silly little joke I know that's what I do like have we heard a
4360360	4363640	lot about download content with DJ hero there will be some that's about all we
4363640	4369080	know because I know someone actually I for whatever reason they have visited
4369080	4372200	their website and actually looked at their Twitter and there was someone
4372200	4374920	asking hey is there gonna be download content and they're like of course
4374920	4379400	there's gonna be download content but not necessarily regularly like you see
4379400	4382200	in rock band because guitar heroes download content seems to be a bit more
4382200	4388800	sporadic yeah I'd be guessing that's gonna be a bit more sporadic Marissa
4388800	4391400	congusto in our chat room chat that orange laundry calm says it could be a
4391400	4396440	pixelated low hand tweeting naked pics that would be a true to life wouldn't it
4396440	4403400	a little to do life all right what else you have for us lovey also of course not
4403400	4407200	really something I would utilize and not really something you'd utilize anymore
4407200	4415680	but Twitter has come to Warcraft thanks to tweet craft a in-game client that you
4415680	4424480	can get you can now Twitter inside the confines of Warcraft this would actually
4424480	4429600	be cool believe it or not if I was like a role player I think it would be kind
4429600	4434280	of neat to have a character using a Twitter like create a character and have
4434280	4438000	them tweet about the things they're doing in World of Warcraft and I think
4438000	4441400	that's probably what most people use it for but I just hope it doesn't turn into
4441400	4446880	this whole like oh I just turned in this quest oh I just dinged to level 77 oh
4446880	4450200	we're running this instance anyone want to join because we don't really need to
4450200	4453300	fill Twitter up with that garbage I hope none of my personal friends are you
4453300	4457600	gonna use this for that but if they're using it to keep all the crack in their
4457600	4461800	vein like they play World of War crack and have Twitter at the same time like
4461800	4465480	I can also understand the need to have that crack all at once all they need now
4465480	4468880	is Facebook as well in World of Warcraft if they don't already have it and then
4468880	4474560	everybody's crack should be set I know according to the screen shot here it
4474560	4477880	doesn't look like they're using it for roleplay in fact one of the people says
4477880	4481920	thank God CNN's finally segueing from reporting on Michael Jackson's still
4481920	4487820	being dead to reporting on what happened to bubbles the chimp nice formation we
4487820	4491440	need to know right away I'm reading this stuff in chat which is great
4491440	4495760	tiger class says great now you can tweet when you're in a wow raid SSJ 100 Matt
4495760	4500840	says at Rob I just got a four strength force damn leather belt that's a all
4500840	4510400	games inside joke I'll have you know frisbee says mom bathroom nice let's
4510400	4513880	just encourage people to not have any human interaction whatsoever by putting
4513880	4518760	Twitter in World of Warcraft exactly I'm not gonna say I'm glad I left because
4518760	4524280	I'm not vindictive about the reasons I left but I am I'm I'm comfortable with
4524280	4528000	my decision and you know that there's many other games to be playing right now
4528000	4532840	and something although sorry I will say this I am kind of sad that I feel like
4532840	4535920	some people I don't talk to anymore because I don't play World of Warcraft
4535920	4541160	which is kind of sad I'm like just call me dude let's hang out let's do some
4541160	4544560	besides rating hang out in World of Warcraft
4544560	4550760	I know no it's something you may need if you really you're you know living the
4550760	4555920	sedentary lifestyle hopefully I will never need this but there is a new DS
4555920	4560680	plug-in that you can use with your DS and DS I because it actually plugs into
4560680	4566960	the DS slot and not the you know the gameboy advanced lot but it is a a
4566960	4573800	device called digit and it's for helping diabetic kids record their sugar levels
4573800	4580160	so that they can see if they're okay you know it helps them test their sugar and
4580160	4586200	I don't know so really you can turn your DS into a diabetic monitor now yeah it's
4586200	4592480	a you know sugar glucose reader and it's I'm not sure if you can use this like
4592480	4596040	well I'll tell you right now your insurance ain't gonna cover it so what
4596040	4600640	you're gonna be paying for that out-of-pocket but I guess what it is
4600640	4603640	probably it's like a diabetic monitor you know when you're diabetic you have
4603640	4607440	to track you know this I'm you have to track your glucose several times a day
4607440	4611800	it depends on how you know there's different stages of diabetes is a very
4611800	4615200	common disease like Halle Berry has diabetes a lot of very famous people
4615200	4618800	have diabetes you have to track your your sugar levels several points
4618800	4621640	throughout the day and then it's you might be what they call insulin
4621640	4625000	dependent or if your levels are really out of whack you have to inject yourself
4625000	4628280	with insulin this monitor if they're encouraging kids to use this monitor
4628280	4631720	there with their DS is probably a way to kind of track those levels but more so
4631720	4636120	for their parents to look at it I bet is it's actually kind of a neat use of
4636120	4641160	technology I actually think it's kind of a neat use of the DS this is this is a
4641160	4646680	feel-good CNN good news story of the week type thing and intended in think of
4646680	4652160	it first screw you vitality monitor alpha
4652160	4655680	kenanagram in chat says Loki yeah this looks like bears ray rebranding of the
4655680	4659320	glucose boy independent they look the same so I'm guessing bear about the tech
4659320	4663700	from the guy that made glucose boy probably possibly who knows frisbee
4663700	4671640	Aston chat where can I when can I have the Wii Fit glaucoma meter so I do think
4671640	4675400	it's a pretty pretty neat idea hey look you brought up World of Warcraft earlier
4675400	4678200	and I want to talk about this a little bit because I thought this story was
4678200	4682720	very interesting having been in a game that was ruined by gold farming or in
4682720	4686880	that particular game Gill farming the game was completely ruined by that
4686880	4691080	although they have made a motion to fix it I'll give credit where credit is due
4691080	4696520	but it came way too late anyhow there was just stories going crazy around the
4696520	4701880	net this week that China had actually banned gold farming which is a huge
4701880	4707240	industry in China it's what like 500 million dollar industry in China that it
4707240	4710920	was banned this week which is huge news well I don't know if you're aware but
4710920	4716000	not really that's not really what happened here's what China really banned
4716000	4721440	was using virtual money for gambling and will be you know punished by you know
4721440	4725440	public security authorities and miners cannot use cannot buy virtual money
4725440	4729760	here's what it really comes down to is I think it's well a it's miners too it's
4729760	4734120	not you know adults but also the fact that the real problem and and Richard
4734120	4737280	Heeks who is a professor at the University of Manchester kind of breaks
4737280	4742920	it down it's what it really is is using these fake currencies one of the big
4742920	4748880	ones is called QQ coins used to buy real I know it's funny huh used to of QQ I
4748880	4754160	don't have any real money using these QQ coins to pay for virtual game stuff
4754160	4758960	apparently some folks were using them to pay for real things and that's what the
4758960	4763760	law is to prevent using virtual currency to buy real products that's what it
4763760	4767400	comes down to and most people are when you do gold farming that's the other way
4767400	4772840	around you're paying real money for virtual items that's still okay it's the
4772840	4776440	other way around that is now illegal which isn't going to impact any of the
4776440	4781400	gold farming industry I'm sorry to say and that makes everyone go QQ exactly
4781400	4787680	because the QQ dollars are still out there that's all I got that's funny do
4787680	4794600	you think they should ban the real thing I don't know if they can that's where I'm
4794600	4799200	at I'm like you know what why bother at this point it's out there it's up to the
4799200	4803920	game makers I think to some extent to stop this shit if they want to really they
4803920	4809280	if they really wanted to stop this crap they could but most don't and really you
4809280	4814800	know as much as I see you know you know it it's not a good thing to buy money
4814800	4818400	they're kind of doing the work and earning the money they're not really
4818400	4822380	exploiting unless they're exploiting the game is cheap and get the money you know
4822380	4825440	if they're earning the money in the game and there's someone out there it's
4825440	4829900	desperate enough to pay for that money. I don't see the problem in that. I see the
4829900	4832760	problem in if they're cheating to get the money and then it screws up the whole
4832760	4837500	economy. Plus, it also depends on the game's design. Like, I don't think gold
4837500	4840320	farming is that big of an epidemic in World of Warcraft. I know it's out there,
4840320	4844120	I know it's being done, but in World of Warcraft it's not that hard to make
4844120	4848080	money. They have dailies, they have ways to make money. Gold farming is for lazy
4848080	4851360	people. If people are too lazy to make gold the hard way. Now here's the thing,
4851360	4855280	in Final Fantasy XI, you couldn't make gil that easily. You could not make gil
4855280	4859960	as easily as you can make money. And some would argue with me, you know, and
4859960	4863980	that's just ridiculous. And again, I realize the game has changed an
4863980	4867400	awful lot since I left. You know, now they have more things that are solo. I'm
4867400	4871400	talking about the old Final Fantasy XI. Things that I hope Square has learned
4871400	4876480	before Final Fantasy XIV, in other words, is that, you know, gil farming was an
4876480	4879280	epidemic and it was killing the game. Because what would happen is, yeah, what
4879280	4883040	was the only way to make gil? You camp these notorious monsters that would drop
4883040	4886240	items that would be worth millions of gil. Well guess what? All the gold farmers
4886240	4889440	are out there camping with you and they got good at it. But WoW doesn't have
4889440	4894240	that as an epidemic. So, you know, finally, years later, they changed it in Final
4894240	4897160	Fantasy where the items would bind a certain way. You know, it just took them
4897160	4900560	too damn long to do it. Lessons, again, I hope they have learned moving into Final
4900560	4904760	Fantasy XIV. Because Final Fantasy XIV has the potential to be amazing.
4904760	4908720	Rama asked in our chat room, chat.orangemanstrategy.com, now with Final
4908720	4912880	Fantasy XIV will they shut down Final Fantasy XI? Hardly. No. Will they have
4912880	4917120	to do server consolidations and things of this sort? Probably. Will they lose
4917120	4921520	players? Probably. But they'll probably charge more for Final Fantasy XIV. Not a
4921520	4925920	lot more, but they'll probably charge like 1495 or 1595 a month. Because they
4925920	4929400	could probably get away with it. So they won't care if people jump ship because
4929400	4933840	they'll end up making more money off of them. I guess XI. It's actually... I had a lot of fun with it.
4933840	4937320	I did too, you know, but I'll tell you what, Loki, I went back, tried to play
4937320	4940840	again. It's just, you know, maybe if all the people were still there, which I don't
4940840	4944440	think is gonna happen, it would be kind of cooler. But the way it is right now,
4944440	4949720	I just... I don't have the time for an MMO anyway, so... But I'm looking forward to
4949720	4953480	Final Fantasy XIV. I am definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV. I'm all
4953480	4956560	over that shit. I'm not looking forward to it because I won't be able to play it,
4956560	4960600	probably. Poor thing. What you can do, come over to my house. You can play.
4960600	4963880	Just, you know, tell the wife you're coming over to hang out with Rob. We're gonna
4963880	4975240	watch movies. Bring the kids! Get them into it. No, no, no, that, you know, I... Nellie
4975240	4979840	doesn't want the kids playing video games. I mean, basically she doesn't want them
4979840	4983400	ignoring homework to play the video games. Just fine. I understand that,
4983400	4987320	because, you know what, I never did that. I always did my homework, and then, well, I
4987320	4991000	most of the time did my homework, and I didn't really, you know, play video games.
4991000	4995480	It wasn't an issue like that, but they're gonna play video games. They're, yeah,
4995480	4998000	they're gonna play video games more than the other. I think what your wife
4998000	5002280	hopefully already knows is that if you try to stop them from doing it, they're
5002280	5006040	just going to want to do it more. So you just have to find a balance, is that you
5006040	5011760	can play one out. You can use the TV for two hours. You want to watch cartoons. You
5011760	5015300	want to play video games. Whatever the F you want to do on the TV. I wouldn't say
5015300	5018640	that, obviously, but whatever the F, and me explaining it to you, whatever the F
5018640	5022960	you want to do for the TV with two hours, that's yours. But either A, once your
5022960	5026280	homework gets done first, or B, once your two hours is up, you better be doing your
5026280	5030120	homework, or you're gonna lose your TV time, you know, something like that.
5030120	5033120	That's the kind of system I think you have to do. Always homework first.
5033120	5041560	Yes. Okay, let's talk a little bit about, wait, can I say, can I say, because this is
5041560	5044600	obviously a sparked discussion in our chat room. I have to read this at
5044600	5048800	chat.orangelandtrader.com. First off, about Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV,
5048800	5053440	SGA 100 Matt says they said they will continue to release expansion for Final Fantasy XI,
5053440	5056480	and especially now that they're doing the download expansions now, like there's
5056480	5061360	the MOG, the coup d'etat, or whatever they call it. What the hell is it called,
5061360	5066280	the new Mughal one? The coup d'etat is coming out today, I think, is
5066280	5068960	when it came out. They're doing the download ones now. They'll continue to do
5068960	5073120	that. Just like EverQuest and EverQuest 2 is that I think, unlike EverQuest and EverQuest 2,
5073120	5077120	I think you will see a lot more players on Final Fantasy XIV than XI. I think a lot of
5077120	5080680	people who left XI are gonna come back for XIV. I think that will happen.
5080680	5087760	Also, some comments on the babies. Tigerclaw says they're gonna play video games while
5087760	5092000	parents are asleep. That's true. If the TV is in the kids room with the console,
5092000	5094440	they're gonna play the video games while you sleep. TV is not gonna be in the kids room.
5094440	5098640	GS68 says, from kindergarten through third grade, my parents would only let me play video games on
5098640	5104760	weekends. And I'm thinking, you know, the kids can play not the new console games.
5104760	5109040	They gotta play the old stuff, because it also is more family-friendly, you know, whereas the new stuff,
5109040	5114240	you know, no playing Grand Theft Auto. Although, although with Grand Theft Auto, you know, I know
5114240	5117960	enough about hacking that I could probably take out the blood and stuff.
5117960	5122440	Marisa Congusto in chat says, my dad had a really good parenting strategy so I
5122440	5127560	couldn't play too many video games. He played them so I couldn't. That's more
5127560	5132600	like it. You should suggest that to the wife. I'm only playing video games
5132600	5141600	so the kids can do their homework. I'm doing you a favor. Now cook dinner.
5141600	5146040	Then she needs to learn how to play video games, I don't know. Alright. Yeah, you're gonna learn how to play video games or cook dinner.
5146040	5152440	You need to play one or the other. She's gonna cook dinner because she hates video games.
5152440	5156360	Or she'll play Animal Crossing for the rest of her life. To talk a little bit more about Sony
5156360	5160600	PlayStation. You may remember, of course, they have their PlayStation Eye-based
5160600	5165120	motion capture system that they're planning on using for some really
5165120	5171880	retarded looking ice cream cone things. But there's apparently another tech thing
5171880	5177200	that they, I guess, registered a patent for that's gonna utilize what looks like
5177200	5184280	a giant square-shaped U-thing. Almost like the U-Force. You know, kind of scary
5184280	5189720	enough, but apparently you would use this device in your hands, I guess, in
5189720	5196280	replace, you know, to replace the cosmic ice cream cone thing. But you would use it,
5196280	5202240	I guess, like a, you know, baseball bat or golf club or, you know, sword, whatever.
5202240	5207840	That thing's gonna get broken. That thing looks retarded, if you ask me. Well, maybe
5207840	5210320	it was just patented. That doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna use it. I
5210320	5216560	don't know. Just a giant U of death. applicant anagram is saying that's just
5216560	5219880	a random object, not a controller. That the U is supposed to represent some type
5219880	5223040	of object the person has in their home. And that's what I had thought I'd read
5223040	5225760	is something about that you can use this thing is supposed to be, like, so any
5225760	5229800	object can be used in the game. Which is kind of similar. Isn't that similar to what
5229800	5233080	Natal was saying, too? Yeah. It's gonna be able to scan, like, the kid's skateboard
5233080	5236800	in a little preview. Okay, well that, yeah. So something similar here, right? That'll work as
5236800	5243680	well as they show, but yeah. That's neat. I don't like the idea of those swinging
5243680	5248120	around something that even resembles a baseball bat in my house, so. Unless it's
5248120	5252240	a Nerf bat. Even then. Couldn't you just roll up a piece of paper and tell the
5252240	5257920	game it's a bat? It would work, right? Roll up the newspaper, thunk. Couldn't I
5257920	5262880	hold up the cat and say it's a baseball bat? How long is it gonna take before
5262880	5267560	someone tries to use their penis on this? It's gonna happen. That's the age-old
5267560	5273000	question about new peripherals. How long before a penis is used with it? How long?
5273000	5278920	Try 30 seconds. That's the length of time to unzip and unzip the pants and undo the
5278920	5287460	bell buckle. Scan this! Oh my god. Alright. Hey, look. We got some emails we got to
5287460	5290840	read, so let's get to the mailbag. How's that sound? Mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com
5290840	5294800	That's where you send your emails every week and we read some of our favorites
5294800	5298840	here on the show. That's exactly what I'm gonna do right now. If the Star Stalker's not here
5298840	5303540	tonight, I will read them. If you can scan its objects to be used as guns, you can
5303540	5308600	have your own laser tag. Yes, whatever happened to laser cat the video game? You
5308600	5312400	think with community games we would have this now? I'm surprised we don't.
5312400	5316400	Somebody needs to get on that. Sorry, I had the music blaring that whole time.
5316400	5320200	Mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com if you want to send us an email. Email. First email
5320200	5325680	to us tonight comes from Rick and Rick sent us an email and the subject is
5325680	5329920	Nintendo divorce notice. I would like to hereby make public my intention to
5329920	5333760	divorce Nintendo after many faithful years of devotion to each and every
5333760	5337680	Nintendo console that has been released. After investing many years of my life
5337680	5341400	playing the great library of classic games including a substantial financial
5341400	5345560	investment, I feel my relationship with the Wii is drawing to a close. We made it
5345560	5348640	past the rough patch a few years ago with the GameCube and yes I admit I did
5348640	5352640	cheat on Nintendo with Microsoft and bought an Xbox. I've already apologized
5352640	5356760	for this affair. It's in the past we moved on. And then the Wii came along and
5356760	5360800	life was good again. We had such good times together with Zelda, Metroid and
5360800	5363960	Mario but there was something wrong, something nagging in the back of my mind.
5363960	5367560	Could it be all the shovelware that was becoming more and more common? Could it
5367560	5371200	be all the ported games with waggle attached for no fucking reason? Could it
5371200	5375880	be last year's E3? Could it be all the party games? What's next? Motion control?
5375880	5380800	Yaris? The answer to all these questions is yes. You just don't seem to be trying
5380800	5385040	anymore Nintendo. Do you care? I waited and waited watching this year's E3 for a
5385040	5390680	sign that you still cared but no you let me down yet again. Why should I stay? What
5390680	5394240	can you offer me as a reason to hang around? Why shouldn't I just go and sell
5394240	5398160	my Wii and put the money towards a PlayStation 3? More Mario Galaxy you
5398160	5402560	lazy bastards that's just fat you trimmed from Galaxy One. Mario multiplayer
5402560	5407600	ported from the DS. Zelda? A painting? A frickin poster? And they said the Zelda
5407600	5410080	game actually is not gonna be very different than the first one which means
5410080	5413400	it's gonna be raining on the same engine. I'm reading this poor man's please
5413400	5419360	to the divorce court. A statement about no sword? That's it? Get fucked! Kid IKEA
5419360	5425320	RS? Oh there oh it's there it's coming news flash we don't care anymore. At the
5425320	5427920	end of the day I'm going to be a dad soon and my time will be a precious
5427920	5431320	commodity. I need to know that you are taking things seriously if not I'm
5431320	5436160	walking to the nearest Sony store. It's so sad. You used to try so hard and
5436160	5440280	produce such wonderful gaming experiences. You were top of the pile now
5440280	5443880	you're more bothered about coming on to my grandmother and small children. You
5443880	5451640	disgust me Nintendo. Regards Rick. P.S. I get custody of the Nintendog. Well we will
5451640	5455400	see how that holds up in divorce court with judge who is it in divorce court
5455400	5459400	Judge Mabel? He's Judge Mabel. Of course if he's in the UK he's not even gonna
5459400	5464160	get that joke so forget it. All right that was a well-written divorce letter
5464160	5469240	and I can't say I it's tough it's tough being a hardcore gaming fan and watching
5469240	5473200	what's going on with the Wii but at the same time I think he summed it up right
5473200	5476480	at the end they're more interested in hitting on your grandmother and little
5476480	5481240	children and they're doing a good job of it you can't deny that but you know
5481240	5483880	we're just not the bread and butter for Nintendo anymore maybe Nintendo felt
5483880	5488360	they already lost us between the 64 and the GameCube. I don't know. Well wait not
5488360	5493400	to try. But my thought is a lot of us were children or at least younger when
5493400	5497480	those systems were out I mean wouldn't you I don't know. The problem is they're
5497480	5505440	kind of catering to stupid people but they think that people like they're oh
5505440	5509200	my god you know games are so hard I can't play them well you give it to a
5509200	5515080	kid you know he's gonna figure it out I mean I was a kid I figured out how
5515080	5518600	to play video games you know it may not have been I may not have been good at it
5518600	5523040	at first but it took time I had to practice get better and you know
5523040	5525360	nowadays I think kids should do the same thing because if they're just
5525360	5530360	immediately great at it then good that gives them a self-esteem boost but they
5530360	5536280	still suck it's just the game is really easy. Now I'm looking in chat and some
5536280	5541040	folks want the emailer to understand about Metroid Other M they neglected in
5541040	5545480	their whole little statement there but J-Rod offered up this interesting
5545480	5549040	retort I can think of at least three games from both Sony and Microsoft for me
5549040	5552520	three that I want on day one Nintendo had one game during a two-hour
5552520	5558720	conference. Yeah that is true so but I mean does look cool. Metroid M does look
5558720	5561960	sweet. They just need like ten more of those. And here's the thing though
5561960	5567640	okay is it looks cool but is it actually gonna be cool? We'll see we'll give them
5567640	5572760	the benefit of the doubt we'll see but again they need ten of those. Yeah they
5572760	5576960	really do need more hits throughout the year I mean because I'm sorry but you
5576960	5581080	know people will probably be dumb enough to buy New Super Mario Brothers Wii
5581080	5585640	because it's got Mario in the name and because some parents are like oh my god
5585640	5588600	Mario I gotta buy it you know and they don't know anything about it could be
5588600	5594400	Mario teaches Sudoku and they would probably buy that crap but I don't know.
5594400	5598240	Email number two tonight of five emails we got a few to burn through tonight
5598240	5602160	email number two comes to us from serious turtle this is a very serious
5602160	5605560	turtle we need to take this very seriously guys a couple months ago I
5605560	5609280	discovered podcast alley and thus your show I forgot we were listed on podcast
5609280	5616920	alley that's an old-school podcast podcast exactly oh my lucky stars I've
5616920	5621200	been needing a show like this my whole life I don't have any friends who are
5621200	5624440	hardcore gamers like me so when I heard your show it was fantastic to hear
5624440	5627520	people like me who talked about the things I care about thanks for all the
5627520	5631600	time you invest in the show and tell Loki to stop yelling the turtle sorry I
5631600	5638200	have a problem look this this serious turtle has it has a serious issue with
5638200	5641280	you Loki and that is that you yell too damn much I got to talk to you that's
5641280	5645440	something this is great oh no totally go on a tangent but oh alright funny fine
5645440	5651480	so apparently earlier this week Nellie was convinced that I had Asperger's
5651480	5657560	syndrome isn't that kind of like it's like autism okay so she so your wife
5657560	5662960	thinks you're autistic yes yes because apparently people stricken with Asperger's
5662960	5668120	they have the tendency to be very focused on certain things or whatever
5668120	5673400	basically you know I piss her off a lot by like going on my computer and working
5673400	5676520	on something for a while and not realizing what I'm doing not realizing
5676520	5679680	it's making her angry and some of that and there is a lot of times that I do
5679680	5683440	that and I don't realize it's making her angry I don't really cuz in my mind it
5683440	5687260	justify like oh okay well I hung out with her quite a bit in stuff but you
5687260	5691640	know I guess it's not the right time to be doing that or something like that or
5691640	5696160	like all randomly blurred out stuff like like at your party or something there's
5696160	5699560	people talking about something and somehow I found a way to work in games
5699560	5704080	in there and I blurted out something completely random about like you know
5704080	5707480	like they're talking about like some song may hear something, hey that song is in
5707480	5711080	rock band you know it's supposed to be coming out in a few weeks on you know
5711080	5714880	download content or something it's like no one cares but you know for whatever
5714880	5719760	reason I feel compelled to do that all the time and I can't stop myself you
5719760	5725320	just this show just isn't enough Loki you've spent seven years okay you've
5725320	5728960	spent at least seven years of your life getting the gaming knowledge out there
5728960	5733000	in a way this radio station is perfect for you I don't think it's as per I
5733000	5738000	don't know go to a doctor and no no there's no it there's nothing that has
5738000	5742320	to do that because it's actually you're very socially you know unable to cope
5742320	5746040	with everything basically you can't well I think there's a function in society
5746040	5749640	we're not medical professionals not even gonna try and get into it but it's you
5749640	5752280	know it was funny because there's a lot of symptoms on there and they're like
5752280	5755940	they're different work fields that would be perfect okay but look you go into web
5755940	5760480	MD like yeah and you tell web MD you have certain symptoms I've got this and
5760480	5764580	this and this this every time it tells you cancer every time you go in there
5764580	5768300	and you're like oh I've got cancer I've got a rash on my ass and it kind of you
5768300	5775960	know it flames love oh you have ass cancer you know like or like or yeah
5775960	5782080	you're all yes or no it's not the Tuma anyway sorry to get off on tangent there
5782080	5789680	I just thought it was funny all right next email yes please next email stop
5789680	5794000	trying to talk about things you know nothing about all right this comes to us
5794000	5798240	from death wishing I feel like I have not been involved in your shows for a
5798240	5802320	long time have I missed a lot yes anyways now to get on with some email
5802320	5806080	material have you guys ever heard of a game called urban terror well if you
5806080	5809760	have not then there is no reason to not try the game because because well it's
5809760	5814080	absolutely free it was originally a quake 3 mod and then went into its own
5814080	5820080	standalone game I cannot describe how it plays but I guess it's a miss a miss I
5820080	5823640	think a combination of counter-strike and quake hence it being a quake 3 mod
5823640	5829240	well let's hope I don't miss the cast again I've never heard of this any urban
5829240	5835360	terror so the only thing I've heard of there was a urban chaos or something
5835360	5840040	like that game that was from idos or something that really sucked but that
5840040	5847120	sounds kind of neat email number four from shook hi everyone I've been
5847120	5850120	following this show for about three months and I can honestly say that this
5850120	5852960	is the best video game related show I've ever listened to why thank you I
5852960	5855960	encourage you guys to keep doing this show and if you're reading this on the
5855960	5859120	seventh anniversary I wish to congratulate you on the feet well you're
5859120	5861440	a week late but that's probably my fault because the seventh anniversary show
5861440	5865280	still hasn't hit the feed but thank you nonetheless seventh anniversary or not
5865280	5869240	we'll just say we'll say that's a pre grats for our eighth anniversary yeah
5869240	5874280	there you go last email tonight from the one and only spazzinator hi everyone I
5874280	5878240	thought I'd write this email for tonight show mainly to share a tidbit of info by
5878240	5881280	the looks of things Sony will be doing three things more or less in tandem this
5881280	5886080	summer rolling out the long rumor ps3 slim drop the price of the ps3 by an
5886080	5890040	unknown amount and release firmware 3.0 which by most accounts will be a fairly
5890040	5892800	big overhaul so I'm reading this email because we've addressed some of this but
5892800	5897040	we didn't really talk about new firmware most sources agree that firmware 3.0 has
5897040	5900480	certain features on it similar to what Xbox Live has reputation and griefing
5900480	5903640	procedures as well as finally being able to download game updates in the
5903640	5907280	background where there is still some debate as to whether or not firmware 3.0
5907280	5911080	will also incorporate the recently uncovered patented ps2 emulator that
5911080	5914640	will supposedly work on all ps3s my suspicions are that the emulator will
5914640	5919000	indeed be coming most likely in firmware 3.0 or at least in the next major from
5919000	5922840	where to firmware update after that my reasoning is this there's no reason for
5922840	5926240	any company Sony or any other one to patent anything unless they see a way to
5926240	5929720	make money off of it directly or indirectly seeing as the PlayStation 3
5929720	5934080	sales have been lagging behind the Wii's in the 360s hell even the ps2s these
5934080	5937320	moves that I've mentioned should in theory bolster sales which is
5937320	5940680	ultimately what Sony and some third-party developers want ultimately
5940680	5944400	this is all just hearsay educated guessing on my part until we see here
5944400	5949320	something official however given my tracker record in as far as far as relaying
5949320	5953280	info it's subsequently being true see a prior story I related regarding Capcom
5953280	5956880	releasing games on PSN odds are this will be true proven true as well well
5956880	5961080	that's a and it also bit of a it also makes sense to think about it kind of
5961080	5966160	eases them into digital distribution with ps3 games because you have the ps2
5966160	5968720	games coming out now and I'm assuming those are gonna be at a higher price
5968720	5972600	point than the PlayStation 1 games were you know for the most part I would
5972600	5977440	assume that they're gonna be maybe around you know 15 20 15 to I would say
5977440	5984120	even 15 to like $30 maybe 15 25 ish and if that does well then of course and I
5984120	5989120	mean hey let's release some PlayStation 3 games you know for more money as well

5999520	6002780	here on a personal note I do hope that at least the emulator part is shown to
6002780	6006880	be true me too although I used to have a 60 gigabyte model PlayStation 3 with full
6006880	6010480	backwards compatibility I no longer had that due to unfortunate circumstances
6010480	6013680	and was forced to settle for a non backwards compatible model hopefully
6013680	6017040	this emulator will allow me to play my ps2 games again well thanks for taking
6017040	6020080	this email it's appreciated and keep up the excellent work this email was
6020080	6024360	brought to you by Loki's tingle costume which kindly asks him to wear it lol

6028260	6032240	email you want to send us in a future week sorry I think we'll cost him I do
6032240	6037880	believe that you are about 800,000 copies shy in other words yes I made the
6037880	6041640	costume yet you're gonna have to get to like 50,000 it's never gonna happen
6041640	6045280	they've stopped making the game it's done it's not gonna happen done deal you
6045280	6049080	need yet now all of you should be focusing on a new bet you can get low
6049080	6054000	you know I am not making any bets on the PSP go I'm sorry I don't know that's
6054000	6057400	gonna do because there are a lot of to be honest you know I have a problem with
6057400	6061360	people buying the iPhone because I think it's retarded but you know there are
6061360	6066040	people out there that like to spend a lot of money on stuff that's kind of you
6066040	6069240	guys are gonna have to think really hard and also Frisbee brings up a good point
6069240	6072480	Sackboy costume was better anyway let's not forget Loki did dress up as
6072480	6076600	Sackboy which is pretty exactly I have the head now in my garage I know it
6076600	6079760	scared the hell out of me when I first saw it all right some more news then
6079760	6084000	we'll get into some release dates and the FUs of the week as well let's see
6084000	6094320	here so let's talk a little bit about Xbox 360 we've got last M they've got
6094320	6101680	some information on that and how will be integrated into the new Xbox experience
6101680	6109040	apparently elastic last FM is gonna be free for gold subscribers however if you
6109040	6116200	are still remember you do get to use three hours per month and if you're a I
6116200	6123560	guess you'll have to shell out I guess another $36 a year if you're still
6123560	6128280	remember and just want to use last FM which you might as well buy a fucking
6128280	6134640	gold subscription points yeah might as well so apparently yes silver members
6134640	6140760	will be able to access I guess trial period of three hours a month and comes
6140760	6145040	with video advertising which might get into something else we'll talk about in
6145040	6149600	just a second here and I thought is this isn't now my hope was that I'd be able
6149600	6152880	to use last FM as my in-game music but that's not really what they're going for
6152880	6157080	is it this is just gonna be like a cable channel or something I guess yeah I don't
6157080	6160600	like the cable music channel instant party just add last FM or something I
6160600	6165440	don't know like I've yet to really hear what is this used for I don't know I
6165440	6168560	hope you can use like in-game music pretty cool that would be pretty cool
6168560	6173040	actually is trying out you know the custom soundtracks with fuel the other
6173040	6178080	day only two funny and it doesn't have the greatest soundtrack it really
6178080	6182680	doesn't it's it's got what I like to call excite truck syndrome where you add
6182680	6188400	new music to it instantly makes the game better you know yeah yeah so I don't
6188400	6194120	know it it's alright but um I see I've never used last FM on PC so I don't
6194120	6197240	really know if it's something that I'd be really excited about to be honest I
6197240	6201520	mean I like listening to new music and discovering new artists and stuff but I
6201520	6206800	don't think they have as eclectic tastes as I would have you know I don't know I
6206800	6210600	guess I'll check it out I am a gold number so too bad it's not live through
6210600	6214320	CC 5 instead of last FM I know right I'm saying something nice about life is
6214320	6219760	CC 5 but seriously we might almost consider going back if they could have
6219760	6223200	that on the Xbox marketplace how about we do shoutcast I know there you go how
6223200	6226560	about shoutcast exactly then you can have all games radio on there and and
6226560	6229800	which would include us of course and you know all the other great stations that
6229800	6233640	come with shoutcast but I don't know maybe an IRC let's add IRC in there too
6233640	6238680	and you won't need a PC you can just do it through the 360 exactly that's why I
6238680	6241560	would love to have this show is be able to live I mean you can already hear it
6241560	6246640	on your PSP which is cool but that's like one system out of a lot I guess
6246640	6251840	it's one nice thing I could say about the PSP is that yeah by the way we
6251840	6255240	wouldn't really go back to life this is five chat don't panic we're not really
6255240	6260200	gonna do that besides you know what's funny is that since the show is actually
6260200	6263120	kind of grown a little bit in numbers since we kind of combined with Bobby and
6263120	6265800	we have some of the holdovers from his show and I know he gets a boost from us
6265800	6268580	I don't think we could do the show on like these five anymore without being a
6268580	6271880	professional station we have too many people which is a nice compliment
6271880	6276840	certainly to you know the the listeners and the fact that the show has grown and
6276840	6280840	we're very thankful for that we actually could not afford to do this show on
6280840	6284880	like 365 anymore so don't worry that's not happening I was just making a bad
6284880	6294680	joke sheesh so it's kind of surprising is to go off completely off topic from
6294680	6301040	that Blizzard apparently is not gonna be including land support of course with
6301040	6307400	the Starcraft 2 game oh I heard about this and a lot of people pissed off
6307400	6313520	because you know land is I mean how Starcraft 2 and your Starcraft 1 and I
6313520	6316200	think when you're like counter-strike I mean those are land games right there
6316200	6320800	and you know I know land play is a huge thing especially land parties you know
6320800	6325800	like Korea and stuff and the centers the land party centers exactly well I mean
6325800	6329320	they still have play over there you know battle net stuff but I mean it's not the
6329320	6332920	same so you can still have a land party it's just that you're all gonna have to
6332920	6336800	have an internet connection yeah which in this Wi-Fi day and age shouldn't be
6336800	6341760	that difficult but still it is kind of crazy I mean if you think about it let
6341760	6346680	there is more lag I think involved with you know that because you're not just
6346680	6352120	you're playing off of a local network but I don't know that kind of sucks but
6352120	6356320	basically you know Blizzard's responding to the whole you removal of it because
6356320	6360720	everyone was pissed off there we don't currently plan to support land play in
6360720	6365120	Starcraft 2 as we are building battle net to be the ideal destination for
6365120	6368640	multiplayer gaming with Starcraft 2 and feature Blizzard entertainment games
6368640	6372440	while this was a difficult decision for us we felt that moving away from land
6372440	6376720	play and directing players to our upgrade bell net service was the best
6376720	6380720	option to ensure a quality multiplayer experience with Starcraft 2 and
6380720	6386640	safeguard against piracy as she went under madam chat says hell I'm having a
6386640	6392960	party next week and we intend on playing mass Starcraft via LAN you know here's
6392960	6396840	the thing though here's the thing it's not like you can't still get everyone in
6396840	6400640	a room together and play this game together you just have to do it on the
6400640	6404200	internet which I know kind of sucks and they want they want to do that so that
6404200	6408360	it validates your copy exactly they're trying to it's piracy yeah they're
6408360	6413040	trying to curb someone's gonna create a client that's gonna act like battle net
6413040	6416320	that you'll connect to that and you'll be able to play land with and guess who
6416320	6419520	will be doing that the pirates because they'll figure out a way around this I
6419520	6424120	kind of agree Blizzard ought to know better than this the that they're gonna
6424120	6427080	take it out and someone's gonna find a way to put it back in you know what I
6427080	6431640	mean it's it they might as well just put it in there and just encourage people to
6431640	6437800	buy the game legitimately you know have one computer on the land sneak onto the
6437800	6440960	internet and see if the other copies are validated certainly there's a way this
6440960	6445280	could be done certainly like if one computer like creeps onto the internet
6445280	6448920	battle net could somehow it's kind of tell I don't know I'm just crazy and of
6448920	6452440	course you know everyone's pissed off and what happens when people get pissed
6452440	6458520	off they start a petition and so they have a petition created you know that's
6458520	6464320	basically insisting that blizzard ad land support back I can't wait for that
6464320	6468440	question to be asked at this year's Blizzcon because that is one interesting
6468440	6471400	thing about this story is that oops they maybe should have waited to say
6471400	6474400	something about this until after Blizzcon but they said something about
6474400	6477680	it before so what's gonna be awesome is that now there's gonna be these big
6477680	6480880	panels on Starcraft then when they take questions why the hell did you take out
6480880	6489920	land support you douche can't wait next question because we did next question
6489920	6493600	no they'll say they'll get blah blah blah well we think the marketplace is
6493600	6497260	shifting and we just wanted to encourage folks to use battle net so that they
6497260	6500700	could track their achievements and everything is statistic based and if we
6500700	6503920	do the land then we can't have that you're gonna get some talk around
6503920	6510880	the answer just wait yeah just wait let's talk a little bit about the Dreamcast
6510880	6515560	yes Dreamcast is of course getting yet another game and much like the
6515560	6519560	other you know new games for the Dreamcast that have been coming out
6519560	6526160	recently is another shmup game the brand-new 2d shoot-em-up game named
6526160	6536480	ducks do you X and it's actually being sold I guess right now for $27.90 I'm not
6536480	6539760	sure if it's gonna be a disk space game or not I guess it could be since you
6539760	6547160	know Dreamcast can pretty much read any sort of burn disk and apparently I guess
6547160	6553720	they have another game that's also coming out as well the company Hugh cast
6553720	6562120	and it's I guess the title is last hope pink bullets which I guess was
6562120	6569600	co-developed by the shins hmm which Wow not heard of any of these things
6569600	6576120	apparently that's actually like the shins like the band the shins huh
6576120	6582760	interesting but yeah I mean it's it's still nice to see I guess games coming
6582760	6588360	out for the Dreamcast prequel all right well you know what guys I think it's
6588360	6591480	time to I get into the F use of the week we wouldn't want to forget it this week
6591480	6594920	so we got to get into the F use of the week and of course the story that
6594920	6598480	inspires our angst this week
6598480	6617160	this has to do with the case of the stolen we this week three teens Josh
6617160	6622280	Carter and a 16 year old and a 13 year old were all arrested on felony charges
6622280	6625920	this week because they stole their neighbors we well here's the thing the
6625920	6632760	mother 41 year old Maxine law actually helped them get rid of the we at a local
6632760	6637280	pawn shop she knew damn well the thing was stolen so they stole this thing from
6637280	6641600	the neighbor and then the parents or the mom I should say parents mom helped them
6641600	6647520	sell it off at a local pawn shop it was being reported by WF TV in Orlando the
6647520	6650760	Maxine law will probably be charged with dealing in stolen property and
6650760	6656080	contributing to the delinquency of minors you should know better you stupid
6656080	6662960	that makes me angry low-key F use the week I guess F you did not have enough
6662960	6668480	time to play games and being broke more or less
6669080	6672880	I don't really have a lot of F use this week I'm generally feeling pretty good
6672880	6675760	so I guess I would just also give an F you to not having enough hours in the
6675760	6680760	day to play video games and F you to Facebook games for being so stupidly
6680760	6681760	addicting
6681760	6688800	alright let's move on with some more gaming news we got release dates to get
6688800	6691120	to two will get to those in a little bit after another couple stories
6691120	6695640	let's talk about some free games a free yes free is good and these are actually
6695640	6700080	some pretty good free games both happen to be fighting games on the first one is
6700080	6706880	a game called vanguard princess and I guess it's a 2d freeware fighter game
6706880	6715600	developed by a looks like a Tomohaki Sugeno and apparently he is an ex cap
6715600	6719840	com employee and the game looks pretty sweet actually you know definitely on
6719840	6724320	par with like something like guilty gear even and that's available for download
6724320	6734000	apparently off of a website www.vector.co.jp that's vector and just do a
6734000	6742440	search for I guess vanguard princess and also the kind of go along with that is a
6742440	6751520	game called dark presence and dark presence is a digitized fighting game
6751520	6756680	very similar to the old Mortal Kombat games and like like Street Fighter the
6756680	6760040	movie the game where they actually captured the the faces of people they're
6760040	6764120	making a new game like this yes that is freaking awesome and actually I take
6764120	6771520	that back this is not a not a free game but apparently new arcade game is not a
6771520	6778760	new arcade game that's pretty awesome so wow that looks really crappy if it's
6778760	6781880	an arcade game I don't know well I was reading something about like it's got
6781880	6785360	more animation I guess than any game like it has ever existed so it's
6785360	6788280	supposed to be a smoother looking game then you know the Mortal Kombat games
6788280	6791320	were which I would hope you know I've been it has been many years the
6791320	6795520	technology hopefully to me it looks like one of those cheesy like games that you
6795520	6798280	would see in a movie or something like that when they're trying to create a
6798280	6802360	game in the movie that you know supposed to represent like a Mortal Kombat type
6802360	6807960	ish game you know something really low-budget but hey whatever if it comes
6807960	6811760	out and turns out be cool you know hey Mortal Kombat at the time I think you
6811760	6816800	know it looks sort of cheesy on a certain level so yeah more power to him
6816800	6821040	all right let's get into release dates shall we we're gonna travel around the
6821040	6824640	world now and talk about what is coming out around the world we're gonna start
6824640	6828400	tonight with Japan's this is a release dates I have up right now coming out in
6828400	6833480	Japan on July the 9th Major League Baseball 2009 comes to the Xbox 360 as
6833480	6839080	well as WWE legends of WrestleMania also making its way to the 360 this coming

6858840	6864000	Japan the next big release Dragon Ball game coming out July 23rd but a little
6864000	6867280	quiet for Wii games right now which is a little strange usually they're still
6867280	6871120	pretty busy Major League Baseball 2009 also makes way the PlayStation 2 this
6871120	6874680	week kind of not surprised though that a baseball release would be kind of the
6874680	6879000	big thing in Japan this week you get some new peripherals for the DS some
6879000	6883480	Disney character headphones coming out but otherwise there's really not a lot
6883480	6887480	of new games coming out but there is a price drop coming out on hamster to
6887480	6891480	coulda so comes out I'm sorry doesn't come out gets a price drop this week
6891480	6897520	which is this happy hamster looking game no I was saying in ten dogs but it's
6897520	6902440	hamsters they do look very cute though oh no sign of Richard Gere in the game
6902440	6908720	by the way and then let's see on the PSP bleach gets a price reduction heat the
6908720	6914520	soul five another port of Major League Baseball 2009 this week and yeah looks
6914520	6917880	like this is a big week for baseball in Japan but otherwise nothing else to
6917880	6923040	really note how about the u.s. u.s. there isn't really a lot of stuff coming out
6923040	6927200	this week pretty much your big release is gonna be the bigs 2 which is coming
6927200	6934360	out on PlayStation 2 ps3 Xbox 360 and the Wii and believe the PSP also this
6934360	6948560	week we've got looks like oh the crappy game here huh and see that on there
6948560	6953960	birthday party bash on the Wii which you know apparently it's a birthday party
6953960	6958600	kit in the box I don't know if you're a mom maybe that might be interesting for
6958600	6967560	a little birthday parties for your kids also this week we've got a port of a
6967560	6972960	game that came out in the UK Sid the dummy which is a crash dummy game
6972960	6977960	something that would have probably been popular like 20 years ago coming on PSP
6977960	6983320	ps2 and the Wii we release a Bioshock and Elder Scrolls for oblivion kind of
6983320	6989560	combined together in the bundle for PC and Xbox 360 the packaged version of
6989560	6993360	Arma 2 coming on PC which is supposed to be pretty sweet
6993360	7000160	memento mori on PC and then coming out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network
7000160	7007600	this week battlefield 1943 also on we wear this week and PC the first chapter
7007600	7012440	of the new tales of monkey island series tales of monkey island chapter 1 launch
7012440	7021520	of the screaming narwhal which sounds pretty cool and also I believe trying
7021520	7025360	is supposed to be coming out on ps3 as well on the PlayStation Network this
7025360	7033320	week as well so not really a huge huge week no not really next week I mean July
7033320	7037680	is really slow for game releases I think next week we've got like NCAA football
7037680	7042360	2010 so if you're in the college football that'd be good for you but it
7042360	7045280	really not a lot of big stuff I think at the end of the month course king of
7045280	7048760	fires 12 so that'd be cool this time of year is usually a little slow isn't it
7048760	7054280	it's always slow a little bit hey how about the release dates over in Europe
7054280	7057320	since star soccer is not here tonight allow me to say that in Europe you can
7057320	7060240	look forward to some of the downloads that we get this week as well tales of
7060240	7064400	monkey island woohoo battlefield battlefield 1943 as well in Europe this
7064400	7068200	week but if you want some of the releases in stores cross edge comes out

7086920	7096120	about apparently according to Sesame Street video games are ok according to
7096120	7101720	Sesame Street so as opposed to according to joystick or destructoid or Kotaku or
7101720	7106000	one of the big game blogs this week it's according to Sesame Street yes
7106000	7113340	apparently I see let's see apparently a game changer report issued by Joan
7113340	7118400	Ganz Clooney Center from the Sesame Workshop basically says that
7118400	7122360	governments the health care industry and schools should be spending less time
7122360	7127160	hating on video games and their negative effort our native negative effects and
7127160	7131360	said be conducting research on their positive effects on kids the port says
7131360	7135680	that games not only can be educational but in this day and age active as well
7135680	7140800	meaning they can be used everywhere from a history classroom to a PE class and of
7140800	7147440	course you know they're all saying the Joan Ganz Clooney Center is to foster
7147440	7151280	innovation and children's learning through digital media so that's their
7151280	7158760	kind of did you hear that Jack Voldemort you listening and yeah that's kind of
7158760	7166960	neat I hope we get a song about it that Elmo sings video games okay just do your
7166960	7172280	homework then you can play hopefully Elmo will never have to explain to
7172280	7176400	children what teabagging is in halo
7177160	7182520	there's some contest there in there that I want to do about who can write the
7182520	7190600	best Sesame Street song for something obscene in gaming nice oh my gosh gold
7190600	7193520	anthro and chat says another reason that says me Street is awesome first the
7193520	7196160	death episode and now video games kind of talking about something we talked
7196160	7197800	about last week
7197800	7201440	all right hey by the way speaking of media I don't know if you guys heard
7201440	7205880	about this but apparently they want to make a movie out of asteroids yes ah the
7205880	7210920	old-ass fucking game from 1979 that many of you know from the Atari 2600
7210920	7217000	asteroids Universal has somehow gotten the rights to make asteroids the Matthew
7217000	7221720	Lopez is writing the script it's being produced by Lorenzo de Bonaventura who's
7221720	7227160	I know produce some other stuff this is the weird thing apparently they're
7227160	7230720	universal is making a lot of movies of some weird shit right now like they they
7230720	7234160	have the rights to some Hasbro games like battleship in candy land are
7234160	7238800	supposed to be coming movies as well yeah they picked up a lot of Hasbro stuff
7238800	7242280	oh you know what where I've heard Lorenzo de Bonaventura before he's
7242280	7246720	producing that GI Joe movie that's coming out next pretty big movie so it's
7246720	7250080	not like these are no-name people but well you know pretty big movie but it's
7250080	7253760	also gonna be a pretty big flop you think so then again then again
7253760	7258520	transformers has a lot of horrible things going for it and it's still did
7258520	7264600	very well so who knows by the way the script writer Matthew Lopez had wrote
7264600	7269120	the movies bedtime stories and race to which mountain and is also wrote the
7269120	7274080	most recent draft of the sorcerers apprentice there you have it I don't
7274080	7279280	know about that you know I don't know as long as I mean where where's the movie
7279280	7282320	in the game I think it there it's not even gonna have a damn thing to do with
7282320	7286280	the game it's gonna be a space movie called asteroids whoop-dee-doo and what
7286280	7289840	is it gonna be trying to be true oh my god I shot the asteroid and it turned
7289840	7296000	into two smaller asteroids oh no quick shoot the UFO for bonus points it should
7296000	7299720	be funnier for those space invaders tiger contest says there's already an
7299720	7303840	asteroids movie it's called Armageddon yeah but Armageddon is actually like 10
7303840	7307400	years old now believe it or not it's kind of an old movie now and they did
7307400	7311400	time for an update blow up the way to make it multiple asteroids leave yeah I
7311400	7315520	guess that's true please no dancing animal crackers in the asteroids movie
7315520	7321160	please no Ben Affleck thank you very much how about we have how many more
7321160	7325200	stories you have maybe one more for the skype line two more I don't know I don't
7325200	7328080	know let's do one more then we'll open up the skype line if you want to fill
7328080	7335360	time with those stories we can okay let's see well I'm not really sad about
7335360	7340520	this but apparently NetErosy is being shut down Sony is pulling the plug on
7340520	7344440	the PlayStation 1 development community they're gonna still keep all the
7344440	7348440	libraries and stuff online but I guess it's officially shut down but honestly
7348440	7352680	they'll still developing stuff on the PlayStation 1 I mean then again I do say
7352680	7355200	that in and there are people developing on the Dreamcast but you know what I
7355200	7357520	think all the people that were developing for the PlayStation 1 should
7357520	7360160	move to the Dreamcast you know because that's the one that seems to be you
7360160	7363160	know supported the most and they have a lot of communities for that and stuff
7363160	7366440	but well for what it's worth you can play a PlayStation 1 game on the
7366440	7371000	PlayStation 3 at least there's that yeah but you can't actually you know publish
7371000	7374840	any more PlayStation 1 games and really can only swap you know the games you
7374840	7380000	make with the NetErosy with the other NetErosy users and I remember there was
7380000	7384640	a time that actually wanted a NetErosy but that didn't happen I was about 15
7384640	7387960	years ago all right let's go to the phones they're ringing already one eight
7387960	7390760	seven seven game olr if you'd like to be on the show tonight but in the meantime
7390760	7394480	we have the call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the guy in
7394480	7398760	East Coast with the fastest trigger Rama hi Rama how are you doing I'm pretty
7398760	7404760	good pretty good what cons you go to this week to as I said the tiger claw I
7404760	7409560	didn't go to any conventions this week I only do the ones are on East Coast I see
7409560	7412760	and of course anime expos the big deal on the West Coast this week which by the
7412760	7418160	way I should say something about this our staffer DJ tyrant Jimmy who used to
7418160	7424120	host a show on our old network with DMN I keep this breast lol now they used to
7424120	7427280	host a show together called STFU he writes for our website once in a while
7427280	7431000	now he actually got some interviews at anime expo I believe we're gonna have
7431000	7435720	the developers of blaze blue on next week in an interview he did so it's
7435720	7438680	gonna be weird because it's not an interview we did but we're all about
7438680	7442520	getting cool like statements from folks that develop games so I'm gonna kind of
7442520	7445440	take a listen and and pick the parts we're gonna air next week and then you
7445440	7450760	get the unedited version on the website there you go that's pretty cool but I
7450760	7457800	will say this for the record ax is not a con it's a trade show it's a you know
7457800	7462760	what I saw ads for anime Expo up here in Sacramento that's how huge that frickin
7462760	7468000	thing is well they roll ads for New York anime festival here in New York and on
7468000	7472680	on on Adult Swim I'm just saying it's considered a trade show because their
7472680	7477360	board is consistent mostly people in the anime industry I see and they're mostly
7477360	7482280	sponsoring the con itself so that it's not fan produced it's pretty much that's
7482280	7486520	why Fana may always kind of puts that big fan that they really sell their
7486520	7491640	thing on fan made fan produced for the past so many years yeah most cons I've
7491640	7496840	gone to especially ones I've staffed and mostly fan based cool well that's cool
7496840	7503240	yeah and I'm sorry I would say all the good cons are fan base but um e3 is
7503240	7507040	pretty awesome for a trade show so trade shows aren't all bad anyway sorry oh no
7507040	7510720	go ahead what else did you want to call in about tonight there's a few things
7510720	7515600	that you spoke of tonight wanted to um throw back at you if you don't mind sure
7515600	7523000	all right in response earlier about the Sony PSP go and the price as I've been
7523000	7528040	saying in the chat room for the longest you're paying for the name not the
7528040	7534680	product Sony has become the IBM of now cuz back in the 80s and 90s IBM
7534680	7539320	machines were quite expensive but people bought his name IBM was on it but the
7539320	7543840	only difference was at the time IBM made good quality product Sony not so much
7543840	7548880	Sony is not Apple they need to realize that Apple can get away with that Sony
7548880	7554680	can't I know cuz I don't know if you ever noticed um if you ever pick up like
7554680	7559240	the Best Buy flyers or when Circuit City was still around in their flyers they're
7559240	7564560	always pushing the ps3s with the Sony televisions if you bought the Sony TV
7564560	7571560	and the ps3 $200 instant savings or if you bought that with rock band or guitar
7571560	7577920	hero world tour you save $300 off the complete bundle hmm it's gotten to the
7577920	7582720	point where Sony cannot sell the ps3 anyway in order for them to push them
7582720	7586840	out they got a bundle it with something you know I'm reading some interesting
7586840	7590120	comments from chat room chat that orange laundry calm j-rod and chat says I plan
7590120	7594920	on buying a PSP go on day one that thing looks pimp as hell don't get me wrong I
7594920	7599240	think the PSP go looks pretty cool but since I already have PSP there's just
7599240	7603200	not enough in it for me I don't know I'm not feeling it for two and I would be
7603200	7607800	all over that fucking thing if it was like 150 even exactly the same price as
7607800	7612680	the current PSP I would be all over it but it's the it's that 250 it's ah I
7612680	7620080	can't I can't do it I'm sorry mmm anyway I don't blame you seriously I don't
7620080	7624840	yeah but you're Sony hater I'm just kidding no I just speak the truth you
7624840	7627440	know that all right look anything else before I let you go and get some more
7627440	7632320	callers two quick things number one at the we was all about motion control
7632320	7636640	would have a shit ton of shovelware games on and as for Starcraft 2 you
7636640	7640720	don't have a shit ton of shovelware games on it where have you been say what
7640720	7644040	it does have a shit ton of shovelware games on it where have you been say if
7644040	7646960	it wasn't for the fact that it was focused on the motion control there
7646960	7651720	wouldn't be as much shovelware oh okay my bad my bad yeah gotcha I'm oh I've
7651720	7656040	been told it's only like two games I own for the week every all the other ones I'd
7656040	7663240	borrowed cuz you know yeah and what was the other thing I'm all about Starcraft
7663240	7666720	you're not needing land support it doesn't cost that much to put in a internet
7666720	7672160	connection a router and a 24 port switch to get everybody up and running together
7672160	7677600	does it do you think it's really gonna have that same feeling though well if
7677600	7681320	they do it where you log in via the application it shouldn't be that much of
7681320	7685560	an issue because it milk I have the same lag time as if you're in the same room
7685560	7690680	you know no depends on who's hosting or all that crap you know I guess true true
7690680	7696400	all right well thanks for your thoughts Rama and good luck from later j-rod I
7696400	7700400	wanted to clarify we were saying earlier he says I don't own a PSP so that's why
7700400	7704360	it's probably so attractive to me yeah I'd be I'd probably be a little more
7704360	7711880	about the PSP if I didn't already own one but still 250 I don't know hi you're
7711880	7722480	on orange launch radio who's this hello you're on orange hello hi who's this
7722480	7731200	hi who is this is Marissa yes hi what's on your mind Marissa
7731200	7737480	well thanks again I just had to say a belated congrats for last week I wasn't
7737480	7741200	able to listen in although I heard it was a good show it was a pretty good
7741200	7744160	show it sadly hasn't hit the podcast feed because I'm a lazy son of a bitch
7744160	7747480	but it will be hitting it very soon and you guys can hear was that it was a
7747480	7752320	kind of a little bit of a throwback to the old days it was cool yeah you know
7752320	7758440	as far as my own gaming week this this fourth of July weekend consisted of
7758440	7765200	watching Chris play Call of Duty and and how is that is this is this fun to watch
7765200	7771320	just play you know actually for some reason it puts me to sleep I don't know
7771320	7774680	what it is the sound of killing and bullets but I just curl up like a cat in
7774680	7778800	front of his feet and I fall asleep all the sounds of murder just make me
7778800	7787440	tired yeah I've actually distracted myself with that old you know you're
7787440	7791920	talking about people doing doing you know making games for Dreamcast and
7791920	7797560	whatnot no systems I distracted myself with Adam all the adventure game engine
7797560	7802560	and was playing an alien race game oh yeah the one you linked me to that
7802560	7809760	looks kind of freaky-deaky but tell us a little bit about this game alien rape
7809760	7814280	escape or something if you know me I love all the old adventure games oh well
7814280	7818520	how do you feel about the new monkey island game coming out I haven't even
7818520	7822480	heard about that to you now so that's cool you know I never got into monkey
7822480	7826600	island even I was younger you know I love a king's quest people and the
7826600	7830600	quest for glory people get mad at me but and Indiana Jones or the state of
7830600	7836040	Atlantis person but I try to remember that the state of Atlantis is going to
7836040	7840960	be bundled with the new indie game whoo yeah that's right yeah I remember us
7840960	7843920	reporting on the show a few weeks ago that it was gonna be coming on the Wii
7843920	7846280	with the game or something like that someday I don't know if it was a
7846280	7850480	pre-order it's been a while now but I I do I did hear that same thing on the
7850480	7855120	show I'm still obsessing over the announcement now we made that a new
7855120	7859280	feast is going to come out but I hadn't just praying every night that I don't
7859280	7868600	fuck it up isn't how it always goes with old franchises though when they
7868600	7871160	announce that there's a new one coming out you just pray that they're not gonna
7871160	7876240	fuck it up yeah well I guess the thing is like one of those took over for
7876240	7879880	looking glass although I didn't I actually like the X you know via the
7879880	7883760	platform game the Xbox game at deadly shadows most of the purists didn't like
7883760	7888600	it and it gets started out kind of lame because they called it a thief with a
7888600	7894560	four instead of the odd or something and suddenly like that so it's like four
7894560	7898760	four something now I don't know how to pronounce it but I guess it's just a
7898760	7905080	working title indeed well Marissa I need to come visit us soon and come be on the
7905080	7909440	show again I'm hoping that'll happen and you have anything else you want to share
7909440	7913960	with listeners tonight before we get to some more calls nothing that wouldn't be
7913960	7919520	sublimely silly so I have have a good night and hopefully I will be seeing you
7919520	7928880	feeling and you need to call so-and-so all right we'll do honey take care I think
7928880	7933760	I think we lost her there we go okay well I do hope Marissa comes back to
7933760	7936400	visit it's been like a hundred episodes since she's been here she's a lot of fun
7936400	7939240	I've been that long she's like it's I know we've been doing the show a fucking
7939240	7942600	long time I don't know if you're aware we have another call coming on hi you're
7942600	7945200	on orange launch radio oops we didn't really answer that call hi you're on
7945200	7950280	orange launch radio who's this hi this is fancy Nader hi spazz Nader what's on
7950280	7956360	your mind tonight um two things which are kind of related to some degree go
7956360	7962280	ahead all right you know I was you know you know you know thinking about that
7962280	7969080	comment you were making about you know someone's making asteroids movie yes
7969080	7974440	question is how the hell do you make a movie on the asteroid there's like no
7974440	7982560	narratives there I mean I can I I can see a movie being here like I'm charted
7982560	7989000	or no dear salad there's a narrative there but easy the same way the same way
7989000	7992320	dude they're making movies out of battleship in candy land they are movies
7992320	7997840	in name only or Pirates of the Caribbean there was really no plot to it you know
7997840	8001760	in the ride but they managed to make three movies and they actually were
8001760	8005400	pretty good now asteroid could be something similar where they just make
8005400	8008200	up characters and then now those characters are associated with that
8008200	8011680	franchise so and maybe that's what they want to do maybe it's type of agreement
8011680	8016200	where if they could do a good movie then they can re-release the asteroid game
8016200	8019640	with the characters in it just like they ended up going back and putting the
8019640	8023360	characters in the ride or more importantly had huge amounts of
8023360	8026680	merchandising with the parrot Pirates of the Caribbean movies I mean that the you
8026680	8029600	know Jack Sparrow figures still sell like crazy and you see tons of them at
8029600	8034200	Halloween you know he's a he's a universally loved character so I guess
8034200	8036920	that's a good point I didn't even think about if they do write the movie well
8036920	8040600	enough there there will be an audience for it but there's just not a lot of
8040600	8043920	source material to base it off of what do we know about the asteroid movie it
8043920	8047600	will be about asteroids there will probably be shooting of said asteroids
8047600	8052960	that's it that's all the script requires in some ways it's guaranteed to piss
8052960	8056240	people off less than like the Harry Potter movies like how many people
8056240	8060000	hated the third Harry Potter movie because of all the shit they cut out
8060000	8066280	sometimes it's nice to have a very thin narrative but I wouldn't you know I my
8066280	8070520	expectations for this movie are not going to be I guess that high because of
8070520	8074080	the fact there's no narrative to base it off of if that makes sense I don't know
8074080	8081120	well it could very well be good you know for all I know obviously I haven't seen
8081120	8087240	it so I can't be sure but you know I could be a little skeptical you know to
8087240	8090520	say the least well we should be skeptical it's ten dollars and twenty
8090520	8094280	five cents of our money we're gonna be spending on the movies anyway what was
8094280	8098880	the other thing you want to mention tonight oh yeah I forgot to mention in
8098880	8104400	my email because I can't really mention you know I wrote it but uh I kept it
8104400	8111640	notes earlier earlier this week and on the PlayStation Network store the only
8111640	8117720	time that the video site they got a reasonably new or new for the store
8117720	8123160	enemy series that may be appealing to some of the listeners out there it's a
8123160	8132440	devil may cry series mm-hmm and well I got popped up the first episode to try
8132440	8138320	it out and for one thing it looks pretty good I don't know about the entire
8138320	8145040	series as a whole but just based on the first episode it looks pretty good so I
8145040	8149640	don't know if any of the listening wants to check it out or you guys but really
8149640	8153600	start the first ones you know worth checking out you know that's one thing I
8153600	8157160	have yet to do on the Sony marketplace is check out one of the TV shows or
8157160	8161400	something but that's cool I know they've been kind of releasing some more anime
8161400	8163920	and things like that sort of like there's a whole Street Fighter store now
8163920	8166760	and on the PlayStation 3 I was checking out this week and they actually have
8166760	8171440	like the Street Fighter anime and some of that stuff so kind of different yeah
8171440	8178620	I think I mentioned in a previous email going back several weeks ago that I had
8178620	8187840	recommended the first angel anime series I happen to have all 24 episodes and at
8187840	8193480	least that series is very good it's kind of how to describe it's like a cross
8193480	8199420	between actually has certain elements of specs files and a little bit of
8199420	8208080	Charlie's Angels mixed in yeah it's kind of odd but in a good way definitely
8208080	8211440	definitely worth checking out and that's a bit is that available on on Sony's
8211440	8224520	marketplace yeah yeah it is I think I can't you know remember the name of the
8224520	8230040	developer but you know it's not funimation right and that's for sure but
8230040	8234200	it's pretty good all right I will definitely have to check that out on the
8234200	8237040	marketplace at some point but thank you so much for the call spaz nator you have

8250240	8255800	want to get out there before we take our last call let's see here now we got a
8255800	8260320	call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this is excellent hi
8260320	8264320	excellent what's on your mind buddy hey hey I have a quick question for you
8264320	8268760	guys how can a developer bring out a PC version of a game that's really great
8268760	8272320	and really good but yet have so many buggy and lot of cool issues it's not
8272320	8275760	even funny to even start to mention how many stuff there is wrong with the game
8275760	8280320	are you saying it's a PC game that came out yeah Ghostbusters a video game the
8280320	8285560	PC version is absolutely horrid easy it's not I mean there's so many complaints
8285560	8289720	from so many people they're not even issuing any patches or they're not
8289720	8293360	issuing any kind of you know saying hey look we were sorry we're trying to get
8293360	8299840	on this super duper super duper easy answer for you and what the one kind of
8299840	8304200	problem that I suppose that PC games have in general is that there is not the
8304200	8309620	same quality control that you have on the PlayStation or the Microsoft system
8309620	8313700	or even the Nintendo system is that these games go through no quality
8313700	8318680	control remember when way back when they used to have the Nintendo seal of
8318680	8323240	quality yes the Nintendo seal quality had nothing to do with the fact whether
8323240	8326480	the game was any good or not it just had to do with the fact that the game had
8326480	8329960	been officially tested was officially licensed and approved for the system and
8329960	8333920	usually the games that were like really prone to bugs and had really bad
8333920	8336680	ingression a lot of really bad things wrong with them were these games that
8336680	8341160	came out from color dreams and the other makers attention and makers that wanted
8341160	8344840	nothing to do in Nintendo kind of moving on from that now you have a lot of these
8344840	8348440	companies where you can't even really put the games out on the system unless
8348440	8352720	you go through these rigid tests you know a quality control you know and it's
8352720	8359600	it's little as you know in like the Xbox games you have to have you know things
8359600	8363440	have to be referred to as the r1 and the l1 or the back button in the start
8363440	8367240	button and then the Sony games the X button and O button you know that you
8367240	8370520	have to make sure everything is referred to by the proper name for it I mean it's
8370520	8374480	down to that kind of level of control on the PC who's there to control those
8374480	8378960	games what third-party entity has to look at those games and and review them
8378960	8383200	nobody nobody's really watching that I think it should be more viewing done
8383200	8386960	because like I said before I feel now I'm they kind of gypped out of my money
8386960	8390560	for the game and how they're looking actually forward to playing it on the PC
8390560	8395840	and it's like now to go out and find a way to get it for either the 360 now or
8395840	8400040	the ps3 in full quality and tour you know to play it till they come out some
8400040	8404360	kind of patch you know and it's just like I mean there's been more than one
8404360	8407520	more than one instance with more than one person saying hey look there's these
8407520	8411120	kind of problems I'm running on a you know high-end system and yet it's still
8411120	8415840	running like it's on a 386 computer so it's like what's going on here so
8415840	8419200	interesting comment from Xenocore in the chat room I want to kind of run this by
8419200	8424000	you there is no way an all-encompassing quality control can be run on PC games
8424000	8428680	there are way too many combinations for hardware you can check all you want and
8428680	8432880	still find bugs after release I didn't have any issues running Ghostbusters but
8432880	8437960	it does it done have secure on it however good point is that you know when
8437960	8442080	on the PlayStation on the Xbox at least you have the same hardware so there is
8442080	8444880	something to kind of but but you don't know what components are going to go
8444880	8448280	into those PC games so how can you really audit them I always thought the
8448280	8452960	games for Windows was kind of one of those types of things was a way to have
8452960	8457160	the game's quality controlled but I guess he brings up a good point you
8457160	8461440	can't really test every hardware combination out there but yeah it's true
8461440	8464960	that's very true and I just I was kind of weird because like I said I play
8464960	8468640	Fallout 3 and everyone's perfect I have no problems or anything whatsoever I
8468640	8471720	played this and it's like the whole thing is getting ready to crash at given
8471720	8478800	points it's like I just thought was kind of interesting I just well I'm sorry here
8478800	8482360	the game runs like crap x-link I would still continue to pressure the
8482360	8486240	developers professionally you know write a letter post on the forums what have
8486240	8489240	you get you know the other people you know they've been having problems of the
8489240	8492720	game to continue to helm them and you know say you're not going to support
8492720	8496520	them in the future if they don't fix their crap most definitely I hear you
8496520	8500600	I hear on that excellent good luck buddy and take care okay thank you no problem
8500600	8504600	thank you but bye and Xenocore in chat kind of makes a good point to secure on
8504600	8507320	games kind of have a reputation for running like crap that's something
8507320	8512960	important to state as well so I think we are gonna go ahead and wrap up the
8512960	8515880	skyline for tonight I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through but we do
8515880	8518960	want to wrap up and get out of here before it's too late tonight it's
8518960	8522280	already getting close to nine o'clock midnight on the East Coast do you have
8522280	8525000	any other quick stories one to get out there Loki yeah that's a quick stuff
8525000	8531600	real quick there is a website apparently it's a book project that this guy's
8531600	8537840	doing called there will be brawl and it's the artist names Greg death Greg
8537840	8543680	DeStefano and you can look at the pictures that they have there on www.
8543680	8551520	Greg DeStefano.com that's g-r-e-g-d-e-s-t-e-f-a-n-o.com and they've got some
8551520	8557720	pretty interesting pictures sadly enough that Icarus guy looks like Shane that's
8557720	8566440	kind of funny and wait let me see let me see it's sort of he maybe if Shane took
8566440	8575080	hardcore drugs how about a Wario's John Goodman yeah sort of okay that I see a
8575080	8580960	little more yes okay there you go but yeah it's interesting and then other
8580960	8588560	things there's some cool rumors going on including that there's gonna be some
8588560	8592720	little big planet download content coming soon themed after the Ghostbusters
8592720	8596280	actually this is probably less of a rumor because it's actually on media
8596280	8601480	molecules website and they have just in white text on black background who you
8601480	8606280	gonna call and of course that's from Ghostbusters so makes perfect sense that
8606280	8610200	will probably seen some stuff pretty soon from that probably just costumes
8610200	8615600	though the Hanabi festival is coming back in Europe and there's actually a
8615600	8622320	pretty good lineup of games coming with that including I saw they had an ogre
8622320	8628080	battle which is pretty cool ogre battle from the Super Nintendo pulse man from
8628080	8635880	the Sega Mega Drive bomber man 94 on turbo graphics 16 detonate twin be on
8635880	8641160	also the turbo graphics Kirby's dreamland 3 on Super Nintendo
8641160	8648940	Musha on Sega Mega Drive smash table tennis on the NES and zodas revenge
8648940	8655240	star tropics to all these coming to virtual console during the month of July
8655240	8660000	and yes that's kind of neat yeah so that's pretty awesome Star Trek Star
8660000	8664360	Trek star tropics to never come out over there no I guess not interesting over
8664360	8670960	here yes there no so that's starting actually as of last Friday so some of
8670960	8675280	that stuff's already out and dark soccer would be all over that to Tana Twimby
8675280	8679040	coming out I know she was a fan of that yes so that's pretty cool
8679040	8687160	um Konami a guest is also confirmed that they're gonna be porting over contra
8687160	8694120	rebirth for Europe in August and also drift mania with two eyes also coming to
8694120	8699840	we wear as well so you drift drift mania I guess that's how you pronounce that
8699840	8706480	top-down racing game and you know those are coming to Europe so that means that
8706480	8710120	they're localizing it for English so hopefully we'll see those over here as
8710120	8717240	well this is kind of a neat rumor apparently TMNT smash-up is going to be
8717240	8720760	getting some other characters that aren't necessarily in the Ninja Turtles
8720760	8725200	universe apparently they're also going to be getting two rabid characters one
8725200	8730240	of them is rumored to be dressed up as Sam Fisher from of course the splinter
8730240	8735400	cell series and then also rabid dressed up as a cheerleader and those are
8735400	8739180	supposed to be in you know the all-term Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighting
8739180	8743360	game which is kind of interesting that's some more characters they're shown for
8743360	8746600	that and it's actually some stuff from the comic that I'm not even familiar
8746600	8750040	with and then lastly I just have to mention this because I remember this
8750040	8754680	when I had a graphing calculator in high school that they were trying to port
8754680	8759000	this to the TI-83 but finally Link's Awakening has been ported to the TI-83
8759000	8764360	oh my god and it's been that long that I've been waiting you know I remember
8764360	8767160	this coming out and it's like oh my god Link's Awakening we can play it on the
8767160	8772840	TI-83 but really like those little graphing calculators can handle the
8772840	8777360	processing they can have you show me the video they can hack them so that it's an
8777360	8783360	assembly and stuff I guess it's awful sound quality but uh you know the you
8783360	8786560	know graphics are just it's okay the graphics are kind of crap but well I
8786560	8790320	mean it's a graphic and it's slow but yeah it's a graphing calculator running
8790320	8794840	the game that's crazy and I think that a lot of the stuff they probably just
8794840	8797600	programmed from scratch I don't think it's actually being emulated yeah I
8797600	8800920	can't imagine this is any fun to actually play this is just more of an
8800920	8804720	accomplishment than anything else but yeah I mean I remember you know back in
8804720	8810200	the day it used to be you know this is back when they first started porting a
8810200	8816640	like assembly stuff to the TI-85 and you can hack the calculator to run faster
8816640	8821400	than it normally could and you could do grayscale games and stuff like that the
8821400	8825760	days this is why I quit my calculus class because I was too busy programming
8825760	8835480	games nice but uh yeah and that's all I have right now all right wow we're made
8835480	8838280	it we're to the end of the show I know it's a little earlier than last week but
8838280	8841280	we're kind of at the end of the show and that's okay cuz I don't know about you
8841280	8843640	guys but after this holiday weekend I still have some things I'm trying to
8843640	8847480	take care of before I go back to work tomorrow after this whole three-day work
8847480	8852440	weekend so yeah we're gonna go ahead and wrap things up and get on out of here
8852440	8856400	for the night but thank you guys so much for listening tonight and sadly dark
8856400	8859760	soccer is not here either and you know she'll usually help banter with us for a
8859760	8861960	little while and bring her stories to table she's not here so I think it's
8861960	8865200	gonna be the end of the show believe it or not we're done we're out of here
8865200	8868800	which is also actually it's good because it gives me a chance to make sure I can
8868800	8873560	get on the network and get those other get the files that I need to upload the
8873560	8876320	show later this week because I don't want the podcast people have to wait any
8876320	8881160	longer so we're out of here believe it or not that's it have a great night
8881160	8884920	everybody let's go around everybody's final thoughts Loki your final thought
8884920	8890000	my final thought is I'm watching and someone actually took a DS light and
8890000	8896040	they've managed to turn it into an arcade cabinet or I should say put a DS
8896040	8901600	in an arcade cabinet that's crazy Wow my final thought is instead of spending
8901600	8905000	$400 on a laptop I should have just bought myself an arcade cabinet for my
8905000	8910920	house I would have been fun the real love that you know in hindsight like I
8910920	8915800	said I think before I rather bought see because we're in an apartment complex in
8915800	8918760	order to have the whole thing delivered it comes on a pallet and I mean you
8918760	8922680	can't deliver a pallet of stuff to an apartment complex you're gonna get
8922680	8927080	people looking at you funny and but man that would have been the way I've gone
8927080	8932520	it costs like a sixth of what I paid for it and just you know looks so much nicer
8932520	8937240	all right that's it guys thank you so much for tuning into our show tonight
