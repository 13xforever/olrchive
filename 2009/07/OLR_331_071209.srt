1
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, July 12, 2009, can piracy lead to malware on your DS?

2
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:24,854
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tomb Raider franchise looks ready for a reboot, and could you soon play Rock Band or Guitar Hero with no gaming console?

3
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:35,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,024
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:47,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And here to do it with you guys every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-hosts.

6
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:50,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me tonight, the one and only Techmaster Loki in the house.

7
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

8
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,152
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Loki?

9
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:52,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing good.

10
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:53,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

11
00:00:54,074 --> 00:00:56,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkSakura is joining us a little bit late.

12
00:00:57,118 --> 00:01:08,192
[SPEAKER_05]: She is in her summer class right now, and as you know, she's been having to join us late for some of the shows because she has some type of outdoor activity she has to do, some type of PE class, so she, I think, some type of...

13
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:09,353
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com.

14
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:51,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Phone lines 1-877-GAME-OLR Our email bag, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com It's not just about us, it's about you guys We are the place where every gamer has a voice Anyhow, it's been a fun week, I hope, for you guys out there Just another summer week for those of you folks that are on a break from school or what have you I hope you're making the most of it and getting some good gaming time in We're going to start off the show tonight as we always do, talking about our gaming weeks a little bit Loki, how was your gaming week?

15
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:59,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just playing Grand Theft Auto 4, just still tweaking the editing to make sure everything's balanced.

16
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:11,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I was creating one weapon that's basically a nuke, and it wasn't getting to the size that a nuke should be, or at least, you know, relatively in scale.

17
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:19,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, if I actually created a full-size nuke in the game, that would kind of be pointless since it would destroy the entire map.

18
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:20,227
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um...

19
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:26,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I want something a little bit bigger than say 20 square feet or something like that.

20
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:30,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm working on making that a little bit bigger.

21
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I figured out a way to do it.

22
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:43,600
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's funny because we just can't stop giggling once we fire that and the whole screen gets really this big bright green glow and everything like explodes and it's funny.

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,804
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the game has gotten so ridiculous now that it's just an absolute blast and really kind of

24
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Not resembling Grand Theft Auto anymore.

25
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:58,983
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk a lot about your Grand Theft Auto playing on the show.

26
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:02,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all kind of have the grasp that you do this on your lunch break at work.

27
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:05,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Lunch break and our 15-minute break.

28
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:07,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, so it's all gaming.

29
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, for those folks that are new to Orange Lingerie and maybe haven't listened before, Loki works in game distribution.

30
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:16,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So he literally, for eight hours a day, kind of eats, lives, sleeps video games.

31
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:19,019
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not as glamorous.

32
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,499
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not even.

33
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:36,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Wild Dark Sakura is approaching.

34
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:37,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick, throw the pester ball.

35
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,325
[SPEAKER_05]: She just got out of the shower.

36
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:45,667
[SPEAKER_05]: She'll be joining us in just a moment.

37
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:48,109
[SPEAKER_05]: She came in to make faces in the studio.

38
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:52,211
[SPEAKER_05]: You play actual video games on your lunch break to decompress and stuff.

39
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,713
[SPEAKER_05]: The guys you play with, are they all also game salesmen?

40
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:56,454
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the deal?

41
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:58,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the deal.

42
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:00,896
[SPEAKER_06]: One way or another, they sort of are.

43
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:06,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, before we used to have a mix, we had just all of our game reps playing.

44
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:12,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, we have myself, my friend Jason, who actually moved into the games department, so now he's a game sales rep.

45
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:20,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Our friend Rob Nelson, who's in our video sales department, but way back in the day, he was actually in game sales, and he likes games, so that's cool.

46
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:24,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my boss, Rob, who's also...

47
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:27,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, so you play video games on lunch with your boss?

48
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:27,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

49
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:28,369
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually kind of cool.

50
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:30,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Your job ain't so bad.

51
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,750
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I kick the crap out of him.

52
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:33,371
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot.

53
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:34,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

54
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:37,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I could play, like, Grand Theft Auto with my boss.

55
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:41,374
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing is... Of course, I don't think she really plays video games.

56
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:47,217
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, now, you know, because we play on the consoles that I own, I've modded all those consoles, so now I can take...

57
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,777
[SPEAKER_06]: An image of Grand Theft Auto 4.

58
00:04:50,258 --> 00:05:03,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, I have bought copies, so I guess sort of it's legal, because I do actually own enough copies for all the systems, and I actually have lost and damned on all the systems, so that's pretty expensive.

59
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:12,943
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so we actually do play their modified copies of Grand Theft Auto 4, but we play with our own rule set, and you know...

60
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:14,696
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

61
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:30,145
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

62
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:46,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Video Capture Device

63
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:08,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's nuts.

64
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:34,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Overseas.

65
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Naughty, naughty, but no, we appreciate the support either way.

66
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:38,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't get fired over Orange Lounge Radio.

67
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:46,381
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we'd have some folks that would listen, and I know they were using JustinTV to do it, so... And some folks, for whatever weird reason, like to look at us while we're doing this.

68
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,042
[SPEAKER_05]: But we would also, like, play video games, usually during the show.

69
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:58,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I know towards the end there, before the summer months, we would, like, kind of show games before they were actually out, because Loki is also a crazy import gamer, and would get a lot of games from Japan that he can play on his Wii.

70
00:06:59,249 --> 00:06:59,369
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

71
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,090
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

72
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:22,831
[SPEAKER_05]: or we're going to go back to studio my place and the place that's there.

73
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:35,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So either way, we're looking at getting a more intricate setup with Justin TV where we're going to have a switchboard where we can go between like a shot of us in studio, a shot of the game we're playing, maybe something that's a zoom in on the guest or something like that.

74
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:39,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of some multi-camera angles, believe it or not, should be interesting.

75
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:40,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see what happens.

76
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:42,407
[SPEAKER_05]: That is hopefully in the future.

77
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:45,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I didn't mean to derail your gaming week, Loki, but I don't know if you have anything else.

78
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:48,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Deathwishing says I should make a gun that shoots fish.

79
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:51,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't do that, unfortunately, in Grand Theft Auto.

80
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,866
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make guns that shoot a lot of things, but fish is not one of those things.

81
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:58,628
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw is asking why not Studio Loki if it exists?

82
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:03,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just think with babies on the way, Studio Loki is not really going to be a viable option.

83
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, I don't think you have really any extra space there.

84
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,371
[SPEAKER_06]: A middle bedroom, but it's kind of...

85
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Small.

86
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so is this space.

87
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:10,881
[SPEAKER_05]: We make this work.

88
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually, it would be bigger than this space.

89
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:21,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Studio Loki is always a possibility in a situation where one of us is going to be gone or something, but especially once Loki has the kids there.

90
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:22,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I will have an HDTV in there.

91
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:23,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

92
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:23,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully.

93
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:26,085
[SPEAKER_06]: The wife keeps saying that I can't put it in there.

94
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,425
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, well, you have to put it in our bedroom.

95
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, well, I don't have cable blocks for that, so...

96
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:33,548
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is toweling off from the shower.

97
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:35,229
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, she's wearing nothing but a towel right now.

98
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad that we don't have that, JustinTV.

99
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

100
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:39,933
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she's not.

101
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,695
[SPEAKER_05]: She's wearing very unglamorous sweatpants and a DDR Spot t-shirt.

102
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:45,596
[SPEAKER_03]: These aren't sweatpants.

103
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:47,338
[SPEAKER_03]: These are actually comfortable man pajamas.

104
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:47,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

105
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:49,499
[SPEAKER_05]: From a distance, they look like sweatpants.

106
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,400
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, DarkSakura?

107
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,880
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

108
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:59,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was actually going to say, we actually had another idea about doing some rearranging that would involve opening up a whole wall in this room.

109
00:08:59,606 --> 00:08:59,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang.

110
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:08,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would give us, in fact, it was actually almost specifically for us using this as a studio full time.

111
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,070
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would be making some more room in here.

112
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:16,434
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually thinking about moving the pinballs into that room and moving our living room into the pinball room.

113
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:25,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that sake, that actually moves the subwoofer from away from that back wall so that we're not getting, oh, and by the way, Sega did BOOM!

114
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to the week where Sega does BOOM!

115
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:33,266
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a great video game, actually.

116
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:34,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Just call it Boom!

117
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:35,708
[SPEAKER_05]: With an explanation.

118
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:37,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Copyright Orange Jones Radio 2009.

119
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,133
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't had a dream game in a long time called Boom.

120
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,336
[SPEAKER_03]: It just needs to be called Subwoofer Noise.

121
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:46,661
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, my little brother, Phillip, so cute when he was little, then he grew up, what happened?

123
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:12,265
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to call it the Hoover Darn, because dam was a bad word.

124
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:13,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Because dam's a bad word, right.

125
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:16,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I sort of inherited calling it the Hoover Darn.

126
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:26,234
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, we went to the Hoover Dam, and it was hot, and there was water.

127
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I took pictures of said water.

128
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:31,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God you're here, because I would have never known that.

129
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:32,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whatever.

130
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:34,753
[SPEAKER_03]: God, where the hell is my IRC?

131
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:35,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

132
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:50,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we got lots of frozen yogurt, and I had a few very cool new experiences and met cool people that I had heard of but never got to see, so it was pretty cool.

133
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a very good time.

134
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, did you meet OLR listeners?

135
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:54,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Or were these, like, other people?

136
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:55,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people.

137
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:56,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, okay.

138
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:57,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I went to go see Sauce.

139
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:58,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, because tiara friends.

140
00:10:58,698 --> 00:10:59,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

141
00:10:59,098 --> 00:10:59,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

142
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:04,344
[SPEAKER_03]: and I had really a great, great time.

143
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:06,946
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very relaxing to watch the first season of Dexter.

144
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:08,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that show.

145
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:12,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And watch the first season of True Blood.

146
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:13,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that show too.

147
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally got to see Repo the Genetic Opera.

148
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

149
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,313
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I love Anthony Head in that.

150
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:22,754
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just like, oh!

151
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:24,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Repo in general.

152
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:28,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the only thing I've seen Sarah Brightman in that her voice hasn't irritated me.

153
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:30,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, she's amazing.

154
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:38,449
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, if you've listened to the show for any length of time, or I guess I should say a long time, you know that I've been involved with Rocky Horror Picture Show for a long time.

155
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:47,916
[SPEAKER_05]: And Repo really is kind of like a lot like it, in a sense, where it's that very glamorous musical type thing.

156
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So I love Repo.

157
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:49,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

158
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do enjoy it.

159
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:56,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to pick that up on Blu-ray so I can watch it in all the HD glory.

160
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an extra copy on Blu-ray if you want to buy one cheap.

161
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I got an extra one for my birthday.

162
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're interested in it, let me know.

163
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:08,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in it.

164
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:11,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I also actually did a little bit of gaming.

165
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually bought some games that we never got to play.

166
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:17,516
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got my SNES emulator running on Linux.

167
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:23,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played some of the game that we'll be talking about later.

168
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:26,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, so we're going to have an inspired Classic Game of the Week this week.

169
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:27,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we will.

170
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:30,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not Captain America and the Avengers.

171
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,942
[SPEAKER_03]: We did purchase that, actually.

172
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:34,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and I did when I got back.

173
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Goldanthro in our chatroom at chat.orangelearnsradio.com put, Lol, my mom is watching True Blood right now in my family's living room.

174
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:41,202
[SPEAKER_05]: No joke.

175
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:41,963
[SPEAKER_05]: She loves that show.

176
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:43,083
[SPEAKER_03]: God, that show's awesome.

177
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:46,985
[SPEAKER_05]: True Blood is also a trending topic on Twitter right now, I noticed, as I'm checking the ULR account.

178
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:47,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So it must be a good show.

179
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:48,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never watched it.

180
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:49,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

181
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:50,627
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

182
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:53,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something you'll have to watch.

183
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,170
[SPEAKER_05]: It's its own type of... It's like vampires and stuff, right?

184
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's vampires going public.

185
00:12:58,536 --> 00:12:58,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

186
00:12:59,077 --> 00:12:59,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

187
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,260
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot of human rights parallels and different things.

188
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,902
[SPEAKER_05]: So like Heroes, but with vampires?

189
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:05,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't watch Heroes.

190
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:05,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

191
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:07,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of lost on me.

192
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:13,112
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also saw Drag Me to Hell.

193
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And we paid $2 a piece for it, so it was well worth the money.

194
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:25,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was like, I think either that or The Hangover, and I hate stupid type of- Buddy comedies?

195
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:26,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

196
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:28,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't like this kind of movies.

197
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:32,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And while other people may love them to death, that's fine.

198
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:35,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that your taste is awful, I'm just saying that's not my kind of thing.

199
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:41,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, but, going to see a Sam Raimi movie, you know, how can you go wrong with Sam Raimi?

200
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's dying to say something.

201
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:45,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say what I saw this week too.

202
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:48,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen, and Bruno.

203
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:51,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never have I seen so many people walk out of Bruno.

204
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:53,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hilarious.

205
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:59,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm iffy on Bruno because I have this bad feeling I'm going to get really offended even though I usually find that kind of stuff funny.

206
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:00,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funny.

207
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:01,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for Blu-ray.

208
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:01,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for Blu-ray.

209
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:22,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Pink Penguin and a Tutu

210
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:42,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how to take this because, you know, sure, I'm gay or whatever, but I like to think I'm still a guy.

211
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:44,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you like penguins.

212
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:44,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I do love penguins.

213
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I should tell you why it made me think of you.

214
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:46,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

215
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:47,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of Rocky.

216
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

217
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:54,088
[SPEAKER_03]: When he did the cell block pingo.

218
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:55,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, that was so many years ago.

219
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:56,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, yeah.

220
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were wearing the little pink thing too.

221
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,572
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're not helping my whole manly man case here, so you wouldn't mind telling us about the rest of your gaming week.

222
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:04,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And you like penguins.

223
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:08,015
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't... Don't jump to conclusions.

224
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:10,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

225
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of pinball.

226
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,699
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to the Pinball Hall of Fame.

227
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was in pain by the time we were done, but it was well worth the agony.

228
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:23,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the worst pinball table ever, and it's also one of the most rare.

229
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:25,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I played pinball circus.

230
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:27,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crap.

231
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:31,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth playing once, but it's crap.

232
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:33,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's probably why they only made two of them.

233
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:41,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually went and played a really good Black Knight 2000.

234
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:44,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, I've got the table, but ours is kind of messed up.

235
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:49,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So playing on our messed up table here helped my skills on the really nice table there.

236
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:57,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tiara and I took turns, sort of, on the longest multi-ball session ever.

237
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:00,168
[SPEAKER_03]: of Star Trek The Next Generation.

238
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played the Data East Star Trek pinball.

239
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I played... I did not play Captain Fantastic, sorry.

240
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:10,034
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did play Theater of Magic.

241
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:12,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played Medieval Madness.

242
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:14,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I played...

243
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:19,180
[SPEAKER_03]: The Super Mario Brothers pinball table.

244
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,681
[SPEAKER_03]: The adult one, not the child one.

245
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:25,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played Bride of Pinbot and Pinbot.

246
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:26,225
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have a jackpot.

247
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:30,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I wandered around the place twice looking for a jackpot, but they didn't have one.

248
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:31,650
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's okay.

249
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,410
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Doctor Who.

250
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play, though.

251
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,492
[SPEAKER_05]: No, where is this place?

252
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:34,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

253
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:35,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed that part.

254
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:36,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Pinball Hall of Fame.

255
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, awesome.

256
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:39,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And we drove by the Liberace Museum.

257
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:42,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And all I could think of was, my mom would like this.

258
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:45,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the Pinball Hall of Fame Go to the Pinball Hall of Fame

259
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:16,593
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to eat at this place that Tiara took me to called, I think it's Toto's.

260
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:19,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a margarita brunch.

261
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:22,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know I'm going to go visit Sauce if I'm there.

262
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:23,177
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not on the strip.

263
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:25,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We avoided the strip like plague.

264
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll make Sauce take us out to all the nice places.

265
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

266
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:33,482
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a very, very good time.

267
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I got woken up by a kitten a lot.

268
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan in the Bed

269
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:57,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, DVDs!

270
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:00,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was pretty cool.

271
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:10,421
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had a great time, and I have to thank her and her family for putting up with me for the time I was there.

272
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:11,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great time.

273
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:12,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

274
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm glad you had fun in Vegas.

275
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I know all the good stuff I need to go do, hopefully, if I go visit before the end of the year.

276
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:21,465
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just making his schedule work and my schedule work because he's going to art school now.

277
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:22,345
[SPEAKER_05]: He starts art school Monday.

278
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:22,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

279
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:23,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe it or not.

280
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:28,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he's... You're going to have to forget that whole manly man thing I was mentioning earlier.

281
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,032
[SPEAKER_05]: He's studying to be an interior designer.

282
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:30,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

283
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,934
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think that's awesome.

284
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:35,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to sit down and talk with him.

285
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:36,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so supportive.

286
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:36,957
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be awesome.

287
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:41,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I would actually love to sit down and talk with him about fabric for a project I'm doing.

288
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:46,138
[SPEAKER_05]: He would probably love to talk that shop, especially once he's had some of his classes down.

289
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

290
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:47,638
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty neat.

291
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, enough about that.

292
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:55,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me talk about the stuff that I've been doing this week in regards to video games.

293
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I played pretty much two video games.

294
00:18:57,501 --> 00:19:06,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back to play Final Fantasy IV The After Years because, as you know, I beat the main scenario, but now there's all the spin-off scenarios, so I actually beat the Rydia scenario, which...

295
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:07,323
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

296
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you were playing an outline?

297
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, basically.

298
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:50,229
[SPEAKER_05]: But the main story felt there were more twists and things that made it interesting.

299
00:19:50,289 --> 00:20:02,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I love, love the twist at the end of the main story because it involves introducing a new class to the game, which I love the idea of, and I hope one shows up in Final Fantasy XIV.

300
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to spoil it.

301
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,760
[SPEAKER_05]: If you really want to know, go play it.

302
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a new class.

303
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,682
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a combination of two existing classes.

304
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:09,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's awesome.

305
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:10,844
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to tell me off the air because I'm poor.

306
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:11,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

307
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:12,225
[SPEAKER_05]: LOST ODYSSEY

308
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:32,860
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

309
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:48,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

310
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:16,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

311
00:21:32,663 --> 00:21:34,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I love Lost Odyssey.

312
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:41,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I am about caught up to where I was before, which is where I'm right at the end of the first disc, and I've got three more discs to go.

313
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:50,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll probably be hearing about this game over the next month or so as I play a little more each week to try and beat it, because I want to see what happens at the end of the story, because I never played that far before.

314
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:55,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I got sucked into raiding and wow, or moved on to another game, because I think it came out during a busy period.

315
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:56,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Lost Odyssey.

316
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly Overlooked RPG on the 360.

317
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:01,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why haters hated it.

318
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:06,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think maybe they hated it because in some ways it's kind of linear and a little more restrictive.

319
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:15,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the more Final Fantasy X style of there's no world map, but you go to select areas and the areas are their own little maps, if that makes sense.

320
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:16,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

321
00:22:18,748 --> 00:22:20,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I still enjoy the game.

322
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:22,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, yep.

323
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:23,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that was pretty much my game of the week.

324
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,070
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really just those two games.

325
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play anything new new that came out.

326
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,231
[SPEAKER_05]: No new Xbox Live Arcade games or anything like that.

327
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember what came out this week.

328
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:32,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this a big week?

329
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard now, I heard that Madballs game is out next week.

330
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:36,634
[SPEAKER_05]: You know where I heard that?

331
00:22:37,614 --> 00:22:38,695
[SPEAKER_05]: On a Facebook ad.

332
00:22:39,744 --> 00:22:42,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in chatroom asks Will Rob finish the game or will his gamer ADD kick in the middle of the game?

333
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:43,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned to OLR

334
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:10,608
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkCharger in chat says those dream sequences in Lost Odyssey were one of the best things about the game it's too bad none of them were actually visualized or maybe that was a good thing

335
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:12,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

336
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:16,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in some ways those stories were best left to the imagination.

337
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:17,949
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like reading a book.

338
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:18,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you read a book?

339
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can make up your own visualizations.

340
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:35,295
[SPEAKER_05]: But the cool thing about it was that it did things that books can't do with the text and the music and the backgrounds that you would see and the shifts in the backgrounds that did add some visual impact, but without showing you what people look like.

341
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:36,776
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like deep thoughts.

342
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:42,038
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way, it was, but you make it sound so stupid, and I'm sorry, it was awesome.

343
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Haters gonna hate, I don't even care.

344
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:52,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, before we get into some gaming news tonight and gaming discussion, we want to take care of some housekeeping, of which we don't have a whole lot of right now.

345
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:54,505
[SPEAKER_05]: No shows off in the near future or anything like that.

346
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:57,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Still no idea what's going on for PAX, if anything.

347
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I think both Loki and DarkSakura are out.

348
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:02,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I sadly may have to skip it, too.

349
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:05,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to though, I'm still going to try and make it work.

350
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the week right after my crazy week in Reno that I have planned.

351
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:12,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, crazy crazy.

352
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:16,635
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm still hoping to do PAX, I should know in the next couple weeks.

353
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would love to see you guys at PAX if that happens.

354
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:22,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, we'll keep you posted here.

355
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:25,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Join our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

356
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been getting some ads this week and really appreciate it.

357
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:32,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course we have our live journal community at Orange Lounge and our Facebook group, the OL Army.

358
00:24:33,065 --> 00:24:36,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would plug MySpace too, but does anyone really use that anymore?

359
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:37,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's it.

360
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move into some gaming news tonight.

361
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:40,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, start us off.

362
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:49,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there is a big ol' rumor, or possibly leak, I guess, of a relaunch of the Tomb Raider series.

363
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:53,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I know you're thinking, hey, wait a second, didn't that already happen?

364
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:54,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it did.

365
00:24:54,988 --> 00:25:00,335
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, let's relaunch it again, because, you know, the first relaunch didn't quite work out for them.

366
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:01,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

367
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,217
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

368
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:17,694
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

369
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:54,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It is oddly deserted, and an uneasy feeling settles as strange sounds emerge from the shadows.

370
00:25:54,891 --> 00:26:09,015
[SPEAKER_06]: With only her determination, inner strength, and resourcefulness to help her, Laura must overcome the challenge of harsh and unforgiving journeys that will take her across a vast island wilderness and into deep...

371
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Deep, Claustrophobic, and Menacing Underground Tombs.

372
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:16,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Felicia's actually going to be in tombs in Tomb Raider.

373
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:20,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's more of like a scary game, and that's what GameGuru says in chat.

374
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:22,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rumored to be survival horror, and I think that's stupid.

375
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:27,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and they're also saying, I guess, you know...

376
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:29,257
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

377
00:26:52,063 --> 00:27:05,276
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, you gotta love the survey leaks, but Joystick, the blog that ran the story, they actually were contacted by the Nielsen Entertainment Group to remove the image and the story.

378
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Nielsen, like the ratings people on television, right?

379
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:08,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Nielsen ratings?

380
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:09,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

381
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

382
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:12,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have a similar name.

383
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:13,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

384
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:15,688
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

385
00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:34,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Crystal Dynamics is hiring folks to work on an installment of a AAA franchise.

386
00:27:52,442 --> 00:28:01,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Toby Gard, the series creator, is a leading design group for an unannounced project and Eidos is terrible at keeping its secret games under wraps.

387
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:03,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny.

388
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:10,969
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's probably going to happen and I bet you anything next year you'll have another Tomb Raider game that hopefully won't suck as much as the last one.

389
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:17,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomb Raider's interesting because Tomb Raider, I remember Tomb Raider 2 and the original Tomb Raider.

390
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were really revolutionary PC games back in the day.

391
00:28:20,562 --> 00:28:22,643
[SPEAKER_05]: But that franchise, to me anyway, I don't know.

392
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:24,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, chatters, if we have Tomb Raider fans.

393
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:29,508
[SPEAKER_05]: But the franchise really kind of, it felt like so much more of the same, more of the same.

394
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:36,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And that whole 3D platformer thing was so overdone, I think, amongst the PlayStation 2 and so forth.

395
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:37,874
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing felt very...

396
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:40,719
[SPEAKER_05]: to me, like, you know, after a while.

397
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:48,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, whereas I think those original games were very revolutionary, I think the later ones just bored the shit out of me, and I had no interest in playing them.

398
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:54,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very interesting to me, well, A, that this is a reboot of a reboot of a reboot at this point, right?

399
00:28:55,011 --> 00:29:00,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And that if they're changing the genre up a little bit, that's really interesting to me as well.

400
00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:07,722
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that they might be going a more survival horror route, which seems to be, I guess, all the rage these days with your, you know, Saw and your...

401
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:10,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill and your Resident Evils.

402
00:29:10,364 --> 00:29:17,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It's even funny, though, because when I saw the picture of Lara Croft, it reminded me of someone from Resident Evil.

403
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the look of it looked very much like Jill or something.

404
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:21,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

405
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:26,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what's interesting is that they're talking about doing a movie franchise reboot, too, right?

406
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:27,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Could this be playing into that at all?

407
00:29:28,218 --> 00:29:30,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Could the movie franchise be going more...

408
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

409
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the thing, you know,

410
00:30:00,871 --> 00:30:05,333
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, I don't give a crap if they reboot this because I have lost interest in this series.

411
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:10,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I never had interest in this series, so... Great!

412
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:14,598
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'd like to see them try something different, but it's not going to probably get me to play it.

413
00:30:15,498 --> 00:30:15,778
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey.

414
00:30:15,978 --> 00:30:17,399
[SPEAKER_05]: But what if the game is really good, Loki?

415
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:20,701
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you hear it's as awesome as Resident Evil 4 or something?

416
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:23,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't care for Resident Evil 4 either.

417
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:27,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I didn't play Resident Evil 4, but I don't care for Resident Evil.

418
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:27,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I just...

419
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:29,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

420
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what if it plays like Grand Theft Auto 4?

421
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:33,757
[SPEAKER_05]: It will never play like Grand Theft Auto 4.

422
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:34,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

423
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:37,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

424
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,841
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in chat says, Megan Fox would have to do the English accent.

425
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:43,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Angelina Jolie does have a pretty good English accent.

426
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:47,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Joshi16 says, Megan Fox would have to actually do something interesting.

427
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:50,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Xlink says, the hell with this.

428
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:51,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's my pressure luck game?

429
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:55,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You have that.

430
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:56,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, there is that DVD game.

431
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I got that for you.

432
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that shows how many people actually care about Tomb Raider, at least in our chat room, if our chat is any indication.

433
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:07,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it was all about Tomb Raider 2, locking the butler in the freezer, and then breaking Lara Croft's neck.

434
00:31:07,456 --> 00:31:08,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all about Topless Mod.

435
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:19,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was really the start of that whole craze of every game on the PC has a booby mod, and it was Tomb Raider, the old school Tomb Raider where you could run around as naked Lara.

436
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:20,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

437
00:31:21,576 --> 00:31:26,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, alright, I guess a lot of our folks don't really seem to care about the whole Tomb Raider reboot.

438
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:27,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there you go.

439
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:29,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you disagree.

440
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:33,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I get into the next story, I want to mention this chat comment from earlier.

441
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,161
[SPEAKER_05]: RobX327 in chat says, Hey Rob, a big game did come out this week.

442
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:41,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Battlefield 1943 on Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.

443
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:44,882
[SPEAKER_05]: See, not really my type of game, but good point.

444
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's tons of people that are really into Battlefield.

445
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:49,544
[SPEAKER_05]: That had a really long line at E3 as well.

446
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:50,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

447
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:52,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I kept giving them away and I never got one.

448
00:31:53,186 --> 00:31:55,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I would have played it anyway.

449
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:57,208
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not my kind of game.

450
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:59,409
[SPEAKER_05]: No disrespect to those who enjoy it.

451
00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:04,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to play Battlefield 1942, I think, and I was just really terrible at it.

452
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried playing that on the PC.

453
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:08,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not very good at those kind of games.

454
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:15,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that is a big game this week, but certainly for one particular genre.

455
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:19,040
[SPEAKER_05]: For a role-play gamer fan like me, not as much.

456
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:34,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, alright, anyhow, let's move on to some other gaming news, and speaking of roleplaying games, Dragon Quest IX is definitely highly anticipated, and of course it's so highly anticipated there are folks trying to get the game before it is actually out.

457
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:39,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's actually a leaked version of Dragon Quest IX that's showing up on some, uh,

458
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:40,625
[SPEAKER_05]: D.S.

459
00:32:40,645 --> 00:32:40,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Owata

460
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

461
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:21,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I was reading about this whole story about the whole fake ROMs, and I thought this was very interesting.

462
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:23,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We've heard this kind of thing before.

463
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:28,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Haven't you heard about the musicians who put the fake music out there to stop the pirates?

464
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:32,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was Madonna's last album, but the one before it.

465
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:40,354
[SPEAKER_05]: She put out these tracks on the internet that would play the first 30 seconds of the song, and then the rest of it would be her going, What the fuck do you think you're doing?

466
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:41,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear about this?

467
00:33:42,676 --> 00:33:43,596
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a couple years ago.

468
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:44,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really funny, actually.

469
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:48,500
[SPEAKER_05]: But it would play the first few seconds of the song, and then, what the fuck do you think you're doing?

470
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:54,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is essentially, this is like the game version of that, in a way.

471
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:58,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, now, not to say that this was something that Square Enix did themselves.

472
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:01,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It was probably some anti-piracy people just doing that.

473
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,673
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have seen this kind of thing happen before, like the original EarthBound.

474
00:34:06,093 --> 00:34:06,574
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

475
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,151
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

476
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,630
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

477
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:06,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no vitamin D

478
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,741
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

479
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:31,722
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, Loki?

480
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think game companies might be doing this on purpose?

481
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:37,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think there's any chance at all Square Enix could be behind something like this?

482
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:38,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think they should be?

483
00:35:39,865 --> 00:35:40,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's stupid.

484
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:43,027
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because it's not going to really stop anything.

485
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:47,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, really, a lot of people will download it and then they'll post, Hey, by the way, this is not the game.

486
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:48,729
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually a hacked thing.

487
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:51,050
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really going to affect just a small group of people.

488
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And they found a fix for it.

489
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:52,991
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

490
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:55,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It really accomplished nothing.

491
00:35:55,825 --> 00:36:04,827
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of times there will be these... We've talked about them before, different anti-piracy stuff that they have, especially on DS games.

492
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:15,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It tricks people for a while and it stops them from being able to play it, but then eventually they fix it and patch it and it's done.

493
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:18,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So they found a way to unbrick all those DSs already?

494
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:23,293
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking up something because I was actually looking at...

495
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:53,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really want to pirate the game because I don't really it's a full Japanese game and it's RPG it's just like I don't have time to play it for one and two it's all in Japanese I wouldn't know what the hell is going on so it's just not interesting but I was kind of curious to see if they did find a fix for that stuff and there was someone talking about ways to fix it and there was like apparently a way to fix it if you'd done something else I don't remember what it was but yeah apparently there are ways to fix it if you did you know brick it

496
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:54,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

497
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:59,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And Frisbee in chat says, you can't just break someone's DS.

498
00:37:00,356 --> 00:37:02,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what they're saying, that they break these things somehow.

499
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:04,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you do it, but it must do something.

500
00:37:05,477 --> 00:37:12,360
[SPEAKER_06]: It overwrote something that was on their actual firmware.

501
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just kind of tweaked something.

502
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:15,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

503
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:17,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I don't know.

504
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:19,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is it what these pirates deserve?

505
00:37:19,682 --> 00:37:22,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's what people deserve for being so overeager or careless?

506
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:23,383
[SPEAKER_06]: ToplessMod

507
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:42,924
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

508
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:56,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

509
00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:58,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm borderline interested in Dragon Quest IX.

510
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:01,347
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've listened to the show before, you know I have this weird thing about handheld gaming.

511
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll come out over here eventually.

512
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's going to come out over here, but I don't know if I really want it because of the fact it's on the DS.

513
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:07,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know how I feel about handheld gaming.

514
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,455
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I did play Final Fantasy IV.

515
00:38:10,615 --> 00:38:12,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played Final Fantasy II and I on PSP.

516
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:17,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll probably get this, but I'm going to wait and see the reviews first.

517
00:38:17,642 --> 00:38:36,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of actually glad it's out in Japan for a little while before it comes out here that way I kind of hear if it's good or not the one I really liked Dragon Quest VIII though on PlayStation 2 that was a pretty good RPG that's another one I need to go back and finish along with Final Fantasy XII but I have to go get my PlayStation 2 and hook it up because my 3 is not backwards compatible lame

518
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:38,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine is... Yeah, whatever.

519
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy IV is not like a kid's thing.

520
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,972
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just old school graphics.

521
00:38:59,052 --> 00:38:59,512
[SPEAKER_11]: What was it?

522
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:00,593
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mystic Quest.

523
00:39:00,693 --> 00:39:01,974
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what I remember as a kid.

524
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:03,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hell no, it's not Mystic Quest.

525
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:06,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Final Fantasy IV hard type.

526
00:39:07,418 --> 00:39:13,763
[SPEAKER_05]: The original Japanese one where you get random battles way more often than you did in the American release and so forth.

527
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:14,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a...

528
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:46,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably going to finish Final Fantasy 4 the after years but for right now I wanted to go to something a little more new school and I remembered I really wanted to beat Lost Odyssey and for some weird reason I actually do kind of want to play Blue Dragon even though that wasn't nearly as good I just kind of want to finish that so who knows anyhow VXJasonXV in chat is frowning saying I liked Mystic Quest I beat Mystic Quest actually I did play that all the way through it was not like it was a very hard game to beat yeah it wasn't terrible it just wasn't Final Fantasy at all

529
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,267
[SPEAKER_11]: It really wasn't originally a Final Fantasy game anyway.

530
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:50,549
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't.

531
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:54,094
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, do you know in Japan that game was released as Final Fantasy USA?

532
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:56,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, didn't that make us look stupid.

533
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:06,375
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, keep in mind, though, now whenever games released in America, they get re-released in Japan as international versions.

534
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:09,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Because typically, especially with Square games, we start getting extra stuff.

535
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:17,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, Final Fantasy VII, if I'm right, it got a re-release.

536
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:18,341
[SPEAKER_05]: X did, I know for sure.

537
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:19,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, X did.

538
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:21,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we got another weapon released.

539
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:22,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Shermie

540
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:52,628
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

541
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:40,716
[SPEAKER_03]: A sheep skin, a sheep fur rug At least it's not a severed head But it's like right in the corner under the computer table So it's really in a dark little corner And Shermie has made this like her little bed I think it's very cute Yeah, it's definitely covered with Shermie hair Yeah But, well, when we had, it actually, part of it got ruined because of her to start with But I also spilled Kool-Aid on it

542
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:45,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I didn't mean to get away from video gaming with kitty talk, but yeah, let's move on with some more gaming news.

543
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:49,220
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, if you want to go ahead and get into the next thing for us.

544
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:56,324
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, if you want to join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be live on this Sunday evening as we tape on All Games Radio.

545
00:41:57,444 --> 00:42:08,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was talk about Sony getting the Netflix service, and it's coming to the Bravia TV.

546
00:42:09,482 --> 00:42:11,163
[SPEAKER_05]: to the PlayStation Bravia.

547
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:15,164
[SPEAKER_03]: To the Bravia internet capable TVs.

548
00:42:15,624 --> 00:42:20,806
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually nothing mentioned about it coming to the PS3.

549
00:42:21,946 --> 00:42:24,987
[SPEAKER_03]: There's hints of it coming to the Wii, but nothing yet.

550
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:26,567
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they're...

551
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:42,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony is actually saying right off the bat that they were going to look into content for the PlayStation Network, but they don't have anything regarding the Netflix to announce at this time.

552
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:42,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

553
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:45,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think... Yeah, they probably just...

554
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony might actually not want it on their platform because they have their service on there and they don't want it to compete with their service.

555
00:43:11,983 --> 00:43:13,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're greedy little bastards.

556
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:14,604
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like Netflix.

557
00:43:14,864 --> 00:43:15,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, let's be honest.

558
00:43:15,684 --> 00:43:19,365
[SPEAKER_05]: The Netflix streaming content still leaves a lot to be desired.

559
00:43:19,445 --> 00:43:24,227
[SPEAKER_05]: You are looking at the back catalog of movies that most people missed the first time.

560
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:25,768
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have a few...

561
00:43:26,408 --> 00:43:29,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Decent movies on there now that they have the Stars play especially.

562
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:36,496
[SPEAKER_05]: They do get some stuff that's recently to cable movies, but that's about as recent as you get with a lot of this stuff.

563
00:43:36,536 --> 00:43:38,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they have some of the Disney movies too, I will say, which is pretty cool.

564
00:43:39,398 --> 00:43:42,040
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's still a lot of room for improvement.

565
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:46,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say the thing I like Netflix for best is the TV shows.

566
00:43:46,564 --> 00:43:54,290
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have a lot of the NBC shows and stuff on demand type stuff, and you can get that, but

567
00:43:55,273 --> 00:43:57,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's still a lot.

568
00:43:57,595 --> 00:44:00,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess Sony has the TV service too, though.

569
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:01,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's the competition.

570
00:44:01,918 --> 00:44:02,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

571
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,461
[SPEAKER_05]: But Xbox has their on-demand stuff too.

572
00:44:05,622 --> 00:44:06,923
[SPEAKER_05]: The separate program.

573
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:09,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they just want people to buy their stupid HDTVs.

574
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:16,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And the best thing about this, though, is it's certain HDTVs and you have to have it hooked up a certain way.

575
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:21,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just like a really small percentage of people actually going to be using this.

576
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:23,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

577
00:44:23,638 --> 00:44:29,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's neat I guess, but until it's actually supported on all their TVs, then...

578
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:34,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at some chat comments from chat.orangelandreda.com.

579
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Tigerclaw asks, here's the thing.

580
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those Bravia TVs come equipped with built-in Wi-Fi?

581
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:42,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing they must if they have the Netflix service in them.

582
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:45,371
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of the thing to do with a lot of appliances now.

583
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:47,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Like tons of things are coming out with Wi-Fi enabled.

584
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:52,797
[SPEAKER_05]: They have little radios now that are like internet radios basically that use Wi-Fi.

585
00:44:52,837 --> 00:44:53,818
[SPEAKER_05]: They hook right into Wi-Fi.

586
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:56,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting, I guess, so cheap, the technology.

587
00:44:57,481 --> 00:45:00,862
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're starting to see it in a lot of stuff.

588
00:45:00,902 --> 00:45:02,942
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty soon my toaster's going to have Wi-Fi.

589
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:08,704
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's yelling from the kitchen, you can put Linux on a toaster.

590
00:45:09,144 --> 00:45:16,046
[SPEAKER_05]: You can, but also just have the toaster connected to Wi-Fi where it goes, ding, the toast is done.

591
00:45:16,066 --> 00:45:18,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe it would pop a message on all your computers, toast is done.

592
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:20,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you leave your toast to toast?

593
00:45:22,288 --> 00:45:23,648
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura wants to make a comment on this.

594
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:25,239
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

595
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:50,368
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of devices have Wi-Fi in them, so I would not be surprised at all if the TV has Wi-Fi somehow built in it.

596
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:58,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Attack of the Clock goes on to say some Blu-ray players have built-in Wi-Fi but cost more as opposed to the ones built with LAN.

597
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:04,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's true because to get your Blu-ray firmware updates, you have to be connected to the internet somehow, right?

598
00:46:05,624 --> 00:46:06,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

599
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:12,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Charger in chat says, seems funny that even standalone Blu-ray players offer it from Samsung and LG.

600
00:46:13,293 --> 00:46:17,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard about that too, the whole Blu-ray slash Netflix players.

601
00:46:17,718 --> 00:46:18,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard about that.

602
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Deathwishing is asking for less movie news, more gaming.

603
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:23,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

604
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:35,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you could tie this into gaming somehow because let's face it, those gaming consoles, the 360 and PlayStation 3, the movies are a big part of the business and kind of how they're getting into more and more homes, right?

605
00:46:35,348 --> 00:46:43,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Because maybe mom and dad and grandma aren't so interested in playing Tomb Raider on it, but they'd be more interested in downloading movies.

606
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Watching Tomb Raider on it.

607
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.

608
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:48,731
[SPEAKER_06]: No, probably not.

609
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,861
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the other comment we had in here?

610
00:46:53,382 --> 00:46:56,203
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to add your comments, chat.orangelaundry.com.

611
00:46:56,663 --> 00:47:01,104
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkCharger also says, seems funny that even standalone Blu-ray players... Oh, I'm sorry.

612
00:47:01,124 --> 00:47:01,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I read that one already.

613
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:02,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Where was the one?

614
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:07,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, but DarkCharger said, my guess is Sony doesn't want it because it competes with their own service in their eyes.

615
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess we'll see what develops.

616
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:18,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's inevitable it'll get something streaming soon.

617
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:26,955
[SPEAKER_05]: More along the Netflix model at some point, but maybe because Sony owns its own movie studio and wants to do something different.

618
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:27,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

619
00:47:29,676 --> 00:47:50,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Harmonix basically thinks, and this is according to Josh Randall, their boss, he thinks that the music game genre could actually leave the consoles and actually go to more of their own standalone peripherals, basically the plug-and-play type game things.

620
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we've already kind of seen this with some things.

621
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:55,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they're not very...

622
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:56,081
[SPEAKER_06]: D.D.R.

623
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:17,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the DDR brand.

624
00:48:17,384 --> 00:48:19,024
[SPEAKER_05]: It came with a mat, but it didn't do anything.

625
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:21,225
[SPEAKER_05]: The mat didn't do a damn thing.

626
00:48:21,425 --> 00:48:27,267
[SPEAKER_05]: It was obviously made for three-year-olds, just for them to jump on the mat pretending they're actually doing something.

627
00:48:27,567 --> 00:48:30,328
[SPEAKER_05]: But it would just play these cheesy Flash music videos on the TV.

628
00:48:30,629 --> 00:48:33,129
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the kind of shit three- and four-year-olds love, though.

629
00:48:33,229 --> 00:48:37,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So I forgive them for that, even if they did slap the DDR label on it.

630
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:39,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack's Pacific, G2 Game Girl, Hannah Montana,

631
00:49:07,057 --> 00:49:24,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Video Game, which you will play on Amazon, and I actually did watch this earlier this week just to see what the hell this was, because I knew it was crap, and I really had low expectations for it.

632
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:29,830
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what, hey, for the non-experienced...

633
00:49:32,614 --> 00:49:33,675
[SPEAKER_06]: A six-year-old.

634
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:34,776
[SPEAKER_06]: For a six-year-old.

635
00:49:34,796 --> 00:49:35,397
[SPEAKER_06]: For a six-year-old.

636
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:37,879
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't give a crap, you know.

637
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:38,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

638
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:47,147
[SPEAKER_06]: For $30, you know, $33.27, you can get this guitar that plug and plays into your TV, and you can actually play with Hannah Montana songs, I guess.

639
00:49:47,768 --> 00:49:48,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

640
00:49:49,790 --> 00:50:02,869
[SPEAKER_06]: but I mean until the technology becomes cheap enough to where they can really pack a lot of oomph inside of a little plastic controller I don't think this is really going to take off

641
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what if though?

642
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:10,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm sure this guy who made the comment has to be aware this type of thing has already been attempted.

643
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:14,416
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've never seen anything on a large scale level.

644
00:50:14,796 --> 00:50:19,278
[SPEAKER_05]: This kind of ties in in a way to the fact that like Wi-Fi is in all of our devices now.

645
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:22,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't think you would see something like this get released for $30.

646
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,080
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't you think?

647
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,401
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

648
00:50:47,557 --> 00:50:52,501
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 1 level hardware in one of these things really cheap.

649
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:58,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe even PlayStation 2 level hardware in one of these things really cheap where you can even go on and download songs.

650
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:13,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking this guy's talking about not so much this crap that they make for six-year-olds to easily amuse them for a while so you don't have to listen to them whine, but something that the more adult gamers can take seriously and more importantly, download songs onto.

651
00:51:14,276 --> 00:51:15,757
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be the big thing about these.

652
00:51:16,117 --> 00:51:16,738
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably...

653
00:51:17,538 --> 00:51:24,520
[SPEAKER_05]: If you bypass Xbox Live Marketplace, you bypass Sony's thing and Nintendo's thing, what is one big thing this is really about?

654
00:51:25,621 --> 00:51:26,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Cutting out the middleman.

655
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:29,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Making more money from the download songs.

656
00:51:29,862 --> 00:51:31,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it'll take off.

657
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:32,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to work.

658
00:51:32,983 --> 00:51:37,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just because they are limited to what they can do with the hardware right now.

659
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:40,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I think if it could be done, it would be done.

660
00:51:41,755 --> 00:52:05,813
[SPEAKER_06]: because I mean obviously everyone wants to make money and they're always trying to come up with these knockoff games if anything I could see them doing something you know and I'm surprised Konami hasn't done this yet because they did this with you know some of their Frogger and Yu-Gi-Oh games where they have these things that you basically buy it's a USB thumb drive you plug it in your computer connects you to the internet and you play a game

661
00:52:06,246 --> 00:52:06,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one of those.

662
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:07,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Frogger, yeah.

663
00:52:07,927 --> 00:52:11,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so you get something like this that's either DDR or something like that.

664
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:15,149
[SPEAKER_06]: You plug the mat into your PC, boom, you're playing DDR.

665
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:19,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you plug in the guitar into your PC and you're playing Guitar Freaks or Rock Revolution.

666
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully not Rock Revolution, but actually Guitar Freaks.

667
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:25,932
[SPEAKER_05]: They have tons of this stuff for the TV, too.

668
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:26,512
[SPEAKER_05]: This is huge.

669
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:30,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, even some hardcore gamers like this stuff because you have a lot of those classic video games inside the joystick.

670
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the flashback systems are awesome.

671
00:52:32,254 --> 00:52:34,675
[SPEAKER_06]: The flashback systems are actually, you know,

672
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:35,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Atari 2600s

673
00:52:57,901 --> 00:52:58,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

674
00:53:23,228 --> 00:53:25,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, guys, in chat, would you guys be interested?

675
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:29,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say they could build something like this that would be at a PlayStation 2 level.

676
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:34,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say that you could basically get Rock Band on a PlayStation 2 without needing the PlayStation 2.

677
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:36,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even, let's think, even beyond this.

678
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you be interested in this?

679
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:45,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, through, like, say, a cable provider, like Comcast or something like that, you're, you know, plugging your controller into the actual...

680
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:46,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

681
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:03,199
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

682
00:54:25,313 --> 00:54:26,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Saga Channel Saga Channel Saga Channel

683
00:54:54,664 --> 00:54:59,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of surprised that cable has not tried to get back into this.

684
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:01,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially with Comcast.

685
00:55:01,288 --> 00:55:03,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially, you know, I know them because they're the local provider here.

686
00:55:03,789 --> 00:55:09,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting into DVR and movies on demand and telephones now.

687
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:10,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

688
00:55:12,414 --> 00:55:14,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jason says, totally not worth the investment.

689
00:55:14,715 --> 00:55:17,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember liking the thing as a kid.

690
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:18,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

691
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:22,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason says there's no other way to do it.

692
00:55:22,779 --> 00:55:23,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet anyway.

693
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:24,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

694
00:55:24,728 --> 00:55:37,195
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... I understand you can buy these peripherals and stuff now, and they are expensive, but at least you can use them for a few games and get some use out of them.

695
00:55:38,716 --> 00:55:39,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

696
00:55:39,176 --> 00:55:41,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And the flashback systems are good for what they are.

697
00:55:41,898 --> 00:55:46,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's some old... It's hard to win 600 games.

698
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,582
[SPEAKER_06]: You can hack them, though, so you can actually plug in your own cartridges.

699
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:50,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheap thrills.

700
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:50,983
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they are.

701
00:55:51,043 --> 00:55:51,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheap thrills.

702
00:55:51,423 --> 00:55:51,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

703
00:55:53,063 --> 00:55:54,363
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what you give your kids to play.

704
00:55:55,404 --> 00:55:59,444
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we'll see what happens with the music games in the future.

705
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:01,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll happen.

706
00:56:01,765 --> 00:56:02,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll happen.

707
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll happen by Christmas.

708
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:05,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not this year.

709
00:56:05,886 --> 00:56:13,988
[SPEAKER_05]: They better hurry up and do it, though, before the music... Because, you know, Guitar Hero is forcing the music game series to jump the shark.

710
00:56:14,348 --> 00:56:16,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be interesting to see what happens.

711
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:24,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumor is going around the internet this week that possibly we have a Kane and Lynch fiasco part 2.

712
00:56:24,566 --> 00:56:25,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember this?

713
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:27,508
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a whole fiasco.

714
00:56:27,748 --> 00:56:28,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it part 3?

715
00:56:28,128 --> 00:56:29,209
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Tomb Raider.

716
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:31,690
[SPEAKER_06]: The last Tomb Raider game they did the same thing.

717
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:33,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Well look, let's catch people up if you forgot.

718
00:56:33,492 --> 00:56:43,598
[SPEAKER_05]: There was this whole fiasco with GameSpot where it was rumored, it was never really proved one way or the other, that Eidos was buying off GameSpot to give Kane and Lynch essentially decent reviews.

719
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:47,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember it kind of resulted, wasn't that the reason why some people...

720
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:48,761
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

721
00:57:05,626 --> 00:57:06,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I think was what happened.

722
00:57:26,952 --> 00:57:27,473
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

723
00:57:48,996 --> 00:57:52,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are basically, this isn't the first time this has happened.

724
00:57:52,959 --> 00:58:08,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in November 2008, Eidos basically was putting the same type of pressure on publishers saying that if you're planning on reviewing Tomb Raider Underworld at less than an 8.0, Eidos will need you to hold your review until Monday.

725
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:13,893
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to put it out now, you can put it out at a higher review.

726
00:58:13,973 --> 00:58:18,276
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was like, seriously, you're going to attempt to do that?

727
00:58:19,716 --> 00:58:24,024
[SPEAKER_06]: In their defense, I understand why they're doing that because obviously they want the positive buzz going into it.

728
00:58:24,204 --> 00:58:28,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I'm going to say Batman Arkham Asylum is going to be a horrible game because it's not.

729
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:28,952
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks good.

730
00:58:29,493 --> 00:58:29,714
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

731
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:31,839
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

732
00:58:55,726 --> 00:59:03,952
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to clarify now, now that we've kind of said that, I do want to state this because this is important, is that Kotaku ran an update to their version of the story.

733
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:14,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Eidos apparently contacted them, extremely denying the story, saying, quote, With regards, an article posted on Ram Raider, which was the original site, which, by the way, Ram Raider?

734
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:22,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand what they're, like, the, you know, RAM that you have in a computer, but I don't want to, I don't want to make enemies, but Ram Raider?

735
00:59:22,427 --> 00:59:22,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

736
00:59:22,707 --> 00:59:22,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

737
00:59:23,988 --> 00:59:25,709
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just begging to be made fun of.

738
00:59:25,749 --> 00:59:26,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

739
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,090
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just a blog.

740
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,133
[SPEAKER_06]: It's literally like a blog run at blogspot.com.

741
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:31,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like the name of the bad porn.

742
00:59:31,654 --> 00:59:32,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

743
00:59:32,254 --> 00:59:32,935
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, sorry.

744
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:35,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope nobody from that site listens to the show.

745
00:59:35,577 --> 00:59:38,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean to make fun, but look at all the attention and extra views you're getting this week.

746
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:51,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, Eidos said, With regards to the article posted on Ram Raider alleging that Eidos has fixed review scores for Batman Arkham Asylum, we want to state that no discussions have been held about review scores with any magazines.

747
00:59:52,003 --> 00:59:56,945
[SPEAKER_05]: In short, there is simply not one shred of truth in this article except for the title of the game.

748
00:59:57,005 --> 00:59:59,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is from John Brook, the head of UK marketing for Eidos.

749
01:00:00,325 --> 01:00:02,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So they deny it, saying this is not true.

750
01:00:03,206 --> 01:00:05,987
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be fair to them...

751
01:00:06,787 --> 01:00:16,870
[SPEAKER_05]: What a good lie that would be to say that any magazine that puts it on the cover and has a review score of 90% or above is kind of breaking the rules a little bit.

752
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,410
[SPEAKER_05]: But it'll be interesting to see.

753
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:25,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one way you could prove this story true is what sites have their reviews up by a certain day?

754
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:27,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they all good news?

755
01:00:27,293 --> 01:00:27,753
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

756
01:00:28,473 --> 01:00:41,071
[SPEAKER_06]: and also if they're coming out and saying oh this is the exclusive review of this I hate exclusive reviews of anything because that's retarded this is my exclusive impression of this game

757
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:42,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

758
01:00:42,837 --> 01:00:43,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Your early review.

759
01:00:44,157 --> 01:00:45,879
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is, your early review.

760
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:51,883
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, what's going to happen is it's going to leak out because it's Eidos and because it's a game that they're probably going to ship early.

761
01:00:52,403 --> 01:00:56,566
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to leak out to the internet and everyone will know if it's crap or not and it will be already out there.

762
01:00:57,067 --> 01:01:02,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to have a bunch of independent blog sites and stuff giving their reviews, breaking all the other embargoes.

763
01:01:02,851 --> 01:01:04,392
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't matter.

764
01:01:04,432 --> 01:01:06,833
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to get what you want anyway, so too bad.

765
01:01:07,974 --> 01:01:08,955
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how things work.

766
01:01:10,697 --> 01:01:17,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a darn shame because if Batman is a good game, even this rumor sadly puts a little blemish on it.

767
01:01:18,348 --> 01:01:21,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, not one that's actually that important.

768
01:01:21,713 --> 01:01:26,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, even amongst all the hardcore gamers, the people that listen to these shows and read the blogs...

769
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the audience for Batman Arkham Asylum is way bigger.

770
01:01:30,342 --> 01:01:40,048
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you consider there's lots of Batman fans out there, the people that saw The Dark Knight, which was, you know, just a huge grossing movie and everything, I think there's a big casual gaming audience for this.

771
01:01:40,068 --> 01:01:47,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And by casual gaming, I mean the college kids who think video games are cool but don't obsess about them like the rest of us do, if that makes sense.

772
01:01:48,793 --> 01:01:50,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they give a shit about the ratings.

773
01:01:50,094 --> 01:01:51,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be a big game.

774
01:01:51,595 --> 01:01:52,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it will be, too.

775
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:55,838
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, coming out in August, there's really only Madden, this...

776
01:01:56,798 --> 01:01:59,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Wolfenstein, and maybe Section 8.

777
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:02,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the big games for August.

778
01:02:04,126 --> 01:02:07,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is probably going to be better than Wolfenstein.

779
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:12,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say it's at least the second top two of the month.

780
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:17,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelonsradio.com live on this Sunday evening, July the 12th.

781
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkCharger says, let's not forget that it could also go the other way around.

782
01:02:21,459 --> 01:02:22,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we'll give you a good review.

783
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we please break this embargo?

784
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:25,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting perspective.

785
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:35,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be that sometimes the offering party is not the game company, but the over-eager site that wants to get the first jump on the review?

786
01:02:35,103 --> 01:02:40,185
[SPEAKER_06]: All it's about is hits and subscriptions is really what it comes down to because...

787
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:49,331
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have the review early, then everybody picks up, oh hey, such and such site or magazine has a review early.

788
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:50,692
[SPEAKER_06]: They put a link to it.

789
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:54,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody goes and visits it or looks at the magazine to see what the impressions are on it.

790
01:02:57,316 --> 01:02:57,716
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

791
01:02:58,096 --> 01:03:03,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if it's the other way around, hey, we'll give you a good review if you let us break the embargo.

792
01:03:04,297 --> 01:03:14,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a problem with that anyways because, once again, there are certain websites, IGN, that like to have exclusive reviews about games and stuff like that just to get more page hits.

793
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all they really care about is just hits to their site.

794
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,201
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure that they make a lot of negotiations with these people.

795
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:26,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, we've seen it firsthand, negotiations about breaking embargoes and stuff.

796
01:03:27,964 --> 01:03:33,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a tool to make these sites feel special and to get more hits.

797
01:03:34,928 --> 01:03:40,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby in chat says, True story, I was doing a review of a certain game series and was allowed to somewhat break the embargo.

798
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:45,973
[SPEAKER_05]: The embargo was midnight on Monday morning and my show is on Sunday night if I like the game.

799
01:03:46,253 --> 01:03:48,414
[SPEAKER_05]: But they wouldn't let me break the embargo if I didn't like it.

800
01:03:50,355 --> 01:03:54,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you guys, I've been saying it for seven goddamn years.

801
01:03:54,858 --> 01:03:57,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Independent is the only people you can trust.

802
01:03:59,517 --> 01:03:59,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe it.

803
01:04:01,398 --> 01:04:03,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe it.

804
01:04:26,004 --> 01:04:27,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

805
01:04:28,085 --> 01:04:29,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I don't care enough.

806
01:04:29,926 --> 01:04:32,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Eidos isn't doing anything for me.

807
01:04:32,427 --> 01:04:33,928
[SPEAKER_06]: They aren't giving me anything for free.

808
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,929
[SPEAKER_06]: They aren't treating me special.

809
01:04:36,149 --> 01:04:37,469
[SPEAKER_06]: What do I care?

810
01:04:37,709 --> 01:04:38,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care either way.

811
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So, big deal.

812
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:43,752
[SPEAKER_06]: If their game sucks, their game sucks.

813
01:04:44,072 --> 01:04:47,314
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's good, good for them because they haven't had a lot of games that didn't suck.

814
01:04:47,394 --> 01:04:49,015
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

815
01:04:49,995 --> 01:04:51,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Mini Ninjas looks good though.

816
01:04:51,856 --> 01:04:52,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give them that.

817
01:04:53,116 --> 01:04:54,437
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, yeah.

818
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:56,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, we'll move on.

819
01:04:56,331 --> 01:05:00,773
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, we'll continue to be as honest as possible in our reviews of games.

820
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have something called integrity.

821
01:05:03,314 --> 01:05:03,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

822
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:05,094
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, let's move on.

823
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:07,135
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some more gaming news to talk about tonight.

824
01:05:07,155 --> 01:05:10,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Release date's coming up, as well as a quick break before too long.

825
01:05:11,277 --> 01:05:16,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we are seeing something that's a little kind of old, coming out in an old way.

826
01:05:17,339 --> 01:05:17,920
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's new.

827
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:19,600
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's old.

828
01:05:19,861 --> 01:05:21,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It's old, but it's new, but it's old.

829
01:05:21,481 --> 01:05:21,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

830
01:05:22,922 --> 01:05:23,062
[SPEAKER_03]: It's

831
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:27,987
[SPEAKER_03]: A new item done in an old way of an old franchise.

832
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us what the hell it is already.

833
01:05:29,948 --> 01:05:30,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man!

834
01:05:31,608 --> 01:05:32,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

835
01:05:32,589 --> 01:05:35,490
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Mega Man demo released for the Atari 2600.

836
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:36,290
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

837
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:38,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

838
01:05:38,772 --> 01:05:48,116
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done for the IM 8-bit show, and it's actually on Atari's Atari Ages forum now, so you can go download and play it on your emulator.

839
01:05:48,908 --> 01:05:52,274
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, if you want to hear some of the sweet Atari 2600 music, here you go.

840
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:54,097
[SPEAKER_05]: See if you recognize what stage this is.

841
01:06:02,665 --> 01:06:03,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

842
01:06:24,693 --> 01:06:29,218
[SPEAKER_05]: with the same little mini monsters, the little dudes that are on the ground crawling back and forth.

843
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:32,521
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, I mean, neat concept, right?

844
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:34,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they're moving right.

845
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,491
[SPEAKER_05]: and then horrible Flickr when the guy gets to Elect Man.

846
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:40,192
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, you know, there's only so much you can do with the hardware.

847
01:06:40,232 --> 01:06:41,992
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some games you can make Flickr work for you.

848
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:42,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

849
01:06:43,192 --> 01:06:46,673
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, you know, it's interesting, it's neat.

850
01:06:47,553 --> 01:06:54,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's more of a novel thing from, oh, that's, you know, oh, it's Atari 2200, ooh.

851
01:06:55,495 --> 01:06:56,395
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that kind of thing.

852
01:06:56,795 --> 01:06:59,915
[SPEAKER_05]: But this does beg the question, why?

853
01:07:00,775 --> 01:07:01,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it can.

854
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:03,516
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a labor of love.

855
01:07:04,443 --> 01:07:07,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's the only way you can justify it because, I mean, really?

856
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:16,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that you'll download and you'll play for five minutes and you'll go, oh, that's kind of cool and tell your friend, oh, ha ha ha, look at this and then you're done.

857
01:07:16,752 --> 01:07:21,054
[SPEAKER_05]: But the sad thing is it probably took the guy five days to put it all together, you know?

858
01:07:21,414 --> 01:07:22,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even longer, maybe.

859
01:07:23,015 --> 01:07:24,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe.

860
01:07:24,296 --> 01:07:27,337
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make a whole Metroid game in a day with a Metroid level editor.

861
01:07:27,638 --> 01:07:33,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, with the Atari games, you just have to know your basic programming and they're done.

862
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:36,162
[SPEAKER_03]: You could probably do that in a day.

863
01:07:36,262 --> 01:07:42,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason in our chatroom, VXJasonXV, says, They do what they want, or I'm sorry, they do what they must because they can.

864
01:07:44,386 --> 01:07:44,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

865
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.

866
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:47,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I get it.

867
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:51,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, actually, I think that's about the most accurate way to describe it.

868
01:07:51,427 --> 01:07:51,887
[SPEAKER_03]: He can do it?

869
01:07:52,528 --> 01:07:53,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, do it.

870
01:07:53,288 --> 01:07:54,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Free country, your server space.

871
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:58,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well we're going to do what we must because we can right now with some release dates.

872
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, take it away with the US releases.

873
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:03,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much coming out this week, unfortunately.

874
01:08:04,753 --> 01:08:07,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a couple Greatest Hits games.

875
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:10,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Transformers on the PSP is now Greatest Hits.

876
01:08:10,415 --> 01:08:11,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised it took this long.

877
01:08:12,596 --> 01:08:15,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty Road to Victory is now Greatest Hits as well.

878
01:08:16,121 --> 01:08:18,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of those can be found for $20 on the PSP.

879
01:08:19,364 --> 01:08:22,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Brand new stuff, Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the Mummy on the DS.

880
01:08:23,987 --> 01:08:29,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PSP.

881
01:08:30,112 --> 01:08:34,535
[SPEAKER_06]: NCAA Football 2010 is your big game for the week.

882
01:08:35,616 --> 01:08:42,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Ripping off on the Cookie Mama franchise, Science Papa coming out on the Wii and DS this week.

883
01:08:42,221 --> 01:08:43,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that from the same company?

884
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:47,156
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's from Activision.

885
01:08:48,277 --> 01:08:51,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony Hawk Project 8, also hitting greatest hits on PSP.

886
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,123
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of PSP greatest hits this week.

887
01:08:57,525 --> 01:09:00,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, also greatest hits on PSP.

888
01:09:01,741 --> 01:09:04,182
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the last game this week, Birthday Party Bash.

889
01:09:04,402 --> 01:09:08,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a birthday party in a box with coloring sheets and fun stuff like that.

890
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:15,727
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a generic party game and that's available on the Wii from Take-Two.

891
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:18,208
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

892
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:19,688
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a slow week.

893
01:09:19,808 --> 01:09:27,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and a whole ton of controller skins for all your favorite college football teams available on Xbox 360 and PS3.

894
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:33,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, moving on to Japanese release dates.

895
01:09:34,112 --> 01:09:37,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing on Xbox 360 this week, but there is a game on PlayStation 3.

896
01:09:37,693 --> 01:09:42,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Professional Baseball Spirits Version 6 is out this week from Konami in Japan.

897
01:09:42,816 --> 01:09:45,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like a very realistic type of baseball game.

898
01:09:45,957 --> 01:09:48,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know baseball is pretty popular over in Japan.

899
01:09:48,558 --> 01:09:49,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And a very realistic looking game.

900
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:54,541
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty cool looking baseball game with all the Japanese teams and such, I'm sure.

901
01:09:54,901 --> 01:09:56,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's an officially licensed thing or what.

902
01:09:57,021 --> 01:09:58,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not that familiar with this series.

903
01:09:58,422 --> 01:10:01,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But the graphics look pretty good from the screenshots I can see.

904
01:10:01,862 --> 01:10:04,503
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the only big release on the PlayStation 3 this week.

905
01:10:05,063 --> 01:10:13,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to the Nintendo Wii, the only game that's out on there is Nihon Yakyukiku Shounen Batting Revolution.

906
01:10:13,364 --> 01:10:15,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's right, another baseball game.

907
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:18,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But this one's on the Wii, and it is not the same type of game.

908
01:10:18,745 --> 01:10:20,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not from Konami either.

909
01:10:20,066 --> 01:10:21,926
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from a company called Alpha Unit.

910
01:10:22,546 --> 01:10:23,066
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

911
01:10:49,175 --> 01:11:08,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Awatama is another game out this week on the Nintendo DS and quickly going to the PSP there really isn't a whole lot out unless you are a fan of Ys Ys 1 and 2 Chronicles is the big game this week on the PSP so check that out I have that on the PC Engine

912
01:11:08,991 --> 01:11:11,192
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really it as far as release dates go this week.

913
01:11:11,232 --> 01:11:20,095
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way though, I do want to quickly say one thing I noticed that's being marketed here on this site where I get the Japanese release dates from, this new Korean thing called the Wiz.

914
01:11:20,136 --> 01:11:21,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard of this, Loki?

915
01:11:21,596 --> 01:11:27,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a little handheld device that looks like I guess you could say like a Game Boy Advance is what it looks like.

916
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:37,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But what it is, it's actually a little mini computer that is like it's 533 megahertz with a 3D accelerator open source platform Linux operating system on it.

917
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:38,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's this tiny

918
01:11:38,803 --> 01:11:41,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they've got a few of those.

919
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:47,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, they were showing off some of those at like the last, not last E3, but the last E3 went before that.

920
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:52,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this has been out a while and I'm just now noticing it because it's on sale or something, but it just looks neat.

921
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:53,267
[SPEAKER_05]: It does video and everything.

922
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:54,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're out there.

923
01:11:54,487 --> 01:11:56,348
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of open source platforms.

924
01:11:56,368 --> 01:11:59,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the other one was like GPX2 or something like that.

925
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:00,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what it was called.

926
01:12:00,909 --> 01:12:01,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

927
01:12:01,269 --> 01:12:02,410
[SPEAKER_05]: on the 17th Planet Commando for PC.

928
01:12:19,338 --> 01:12:20,179
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

929
01:12:48,334 --> 01:12:52,875
[SPEAKER_06]: There are two big games coming out this fall from Activision and EA.

930
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:58,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Tar Hero 5 and The Beatles Rock Band.

931
01:12:58,836 --> 01:13:05,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Those games are definitely going to be very hot sellers on all platforms.

932
01:13:05,818 --> 01:13:10,279
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, this is also kind of a test for Activision and EA.

933
01:13:10,339 --> 01:13:11,519
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first game...

934
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:13,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

935
01:13:35,307 --> 01:13:38,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling this may be a start of another new trend.

936
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:41,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you remember with Xbox Live Arcade and stuff like that.

937
01:13:43,672 --> 01:13:48,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Top price at one point was $10 or 800 Microsoft points.

938
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:53,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there was one game out there that decided, hey, you know what, let's try to charge $1,200 Microsoft points.

939
01:13:53,918 --> 01:13:56,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't Luminous the first one that went to $15?

940
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:01,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Luminous or maybe... I'm not sure what the other one might have been.

941
01:14:01,843 --> 01:14:02,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

942
01:14:21,741 --> 01:14:43,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling that the trend now with the Wii where $49.99 seemed to be the kind of the cap because I mean after all a lot of the Wii games that are out there were being developed at the same time on the PlayStation 2 and really there is a limitation what they can do with the hardware but I guess they're thinking now that the features are close enough to each other that now it warrants a higher price point.

943
01:14:45,373 --> 01:14:54,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if everybody's noticed that it's a higher price point and how many people actually game on the Wii with Guitar Hero and stuff but that's kind of a disturbing trend.

944
01:14:56,929 --> 01:14:58,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comments in chat.

945
01:14:58,209 --> 01:15:00,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Alphacatanagram asks, was it the Penny Arcade game?

946
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that was the first $20 game.

947
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:03,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that was the first $20 game.

948
01:15:03,891 --> 01:15:08,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Then DarkCharger says, I checked out Major Nelson's site and lots of users are unhappy about the $1,200 price point.

949
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:11,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, you have to kind of look at both sides of it.

950
01:15:12,033 --> 01:15:14,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course people are going to be pissed they have to pay more.

951
01:15:14,433 --> 01:15:16,194
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to kind of wonder, is it justified?

952
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,054
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

953
01:15:17,114 --> 01:15:23,395
[SPEAKER_05]: For an in-depth game like the Penny Arcade game and Luminous and even the, well, Luminous nickel and dimed us to death a little bit.

954
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:24,115
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll say more.

955
01:15:24,476 --> 01:15:26,116
[SPEAKER_05]: The Penny Arcade game, Braid,

956
01:15:27,596 --> 01:15:29,997
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these games are worth $10 to $15.

957
01:15:30,077 --> 01:15:30,497
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

958
01:15:30,537 --> 01:15:42,620
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not think so, but in my mind, the stuff that really was for $5 was the remakes of 80s video games where they didn't really do much to it.

959
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:51,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about the Pac-Mans, the Gyruses, the Froggers, those old school games where they didn't really do that much to it but re-skin it.

960
01:15:51,782 --> 01:15:52,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That was $5.

961
01:15:53,462 --> 01:15:58,651
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of this other stuff that they're building from the ground up, you know what, face it, a lot of it's worth $10 if not more.

962
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,013
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's my problem though.

963
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:02,217
[SPEAKER_06]: My problem is that these games...

964
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:05,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5

965
01:16:24,816 --> 01:16:27,897
[SPEAKER_06]: The only difference is you'll probably get download content with the Wii version.

966
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:32,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is fine, because right now I don't think World Tour has download content on the Wii.

967
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they do, I don't remember.

968
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:34,839
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think they do.

969
01:16:34,859 --> 01:16:36,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Rock Band 2 is the only one that does it right now.

970
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so maybe they feel that they're more justified for that.

971
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:47,482
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, you're kind of ripping off the consumer who's going to go and purchase more tracks online for more money.

972
01:16:47,802 --> 01:16:49,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Making you more money in the long run.

973
01:16:49,523 --> 01:16:49,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

974
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:56,496
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way that these two games, like on the 360 and PS3, are going to play exactly the same as the Wii version.

975
01:16:56,516 --> 01:17:00,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, graphically, it's impossible that they're going to look the same.

976
01:17:00,139 --> 01:17:05,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's not that important for a guitar hero game, but who cares?

977
01:17:05,524 --> 01:17:06,345
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a difference.

978
01:17:06,665 --> 01:17:08,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that the fact that

979
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:10,028
[SPEAKER_06]: All the Wii games out there have been $49.99.

980
01:17:11,348 --> 01:17:12,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should this change?

981
01:17:12,189 --> 01:17:16,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Guitar Hero Metallica and stuff, the last few Guitar Hero games have been the same price.

982
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:18,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Why change it now?

983
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:19,592
[SPEAKER_06]: And same with Beatles Rock Band.

984
01:17:19,912 --> 01:17:20,432
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the point?

985
01:17:20,492 --> 01:17:25,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know Beatles, it's going to be a more, I guess, developed game.

986
01:17:25,655 --> 01:17:27,095
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a whole different style to it.

987
01:17:27,155 --> 01:17:30,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I'm sure that the graphics aren't going to suffer too much on the Wii.

988
01:17:31,477 --> 01:17:47,417
[SPEAKER_06]: but still though, I think it's a rip off and I think we're going to start seeing more games where it's like oh but look at all these extra features that we added in, but you know what, you would have added those features anyways if you charged a $50 game and maybe you should, because a lot of these Wii games out there aren't just I can't justify the price point

989
01:17:48,258 --> 01:17:49,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta be honest, I don't blame them.

990
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:56,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, on one level, it's the same damn game that you get on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, so why shouldn't they be paying the same price?

991
01:17:57,271 --> 01:18:04,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, I know the Wii is a more limiting system, but at the same time, I mean, that's Nintendo's fault, not the developer.

992
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:24,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, okay, so World Tour on the Wii does have download content, according to Actdeft, um, so, then that, then really, if they've done the same stuff on World Tour already, and Rock Band 2, if they both have download content, they're not really developing a new engine, I don't think, for these games, other than the art style, so, I don't see where the cost is coming into play.

993
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:29,969
[SPEAKER_05]: The cost isn't... I don't think... It's not an extra cost, Loki.

994
01:18:30,269 --> 01:18:31,209
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same cost.

995
01:18:31,889 --> 01:18:34,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same price point that they have on the other systems.

996
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:36,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know it sucks.

997
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:41,572
[SPEAKER_05]: $60 for a game is very expensive, but it's not like you're... You and I aren't going to buy this game on the Wii anyway.

998
01:18:41,992 --> 01:18:44,852
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be spending the extra $10 to get it on one of the better systems.

999
01:18:45,993 --> 01:18:50,634
[SPEAKER_05]: When I say better, I mean with the better graphics and things that are tailored a little more to these games.

1000
01:18:51,054 --> 01:18:51,234
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

1001
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:54,476
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way, I don't really fault the developer for it.

1002
01:18:54,557 --> 01:18:58,240
[SPEAKER_05]: They're charging the same price for the same game that they have on these other systems.

1003
01:18:58,681 --> 01:19:01,964
[SPEAKER_05]: If it can't technically pull off the same thing, that's Nintendo's fault.

1004
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:05,290
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, fine.

1005
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:11,095
[SPEAKER_06]: If people don't have a problem with this now, then don't balk at it when more of your favorite games come out at a $60 price point.

1006
01:19:11,275 --> 01:19:16,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait until Nintendo figures this out that they can charge $60 for your next Mario game or your Metroid game and stuff like that.

1007
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:17,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1008
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:20,982
[SPEAKER_06]: People aren't going to balk at it, then why shouldn't they charge those prices?

1009
01:19:21,122 --> 01:19:22,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them shoot themselves in the foot.

1010
01:19:23,151 --> 01:19:25,372
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to go back to the thing about the Xbox.

1011
01:19:25,752 --> 01:19:29,113
[SPEAKER_05]: If the games really aren't worth $60, they're not going to sell.

1012
01:19:29,794 --> 01:19:31,074
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a backlash.

1013
01:19:31,174 --> 01:19:32,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait and see.

1014
01:19:32,955 --> 01:19:35,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think twice about putting down $60 for some of the crap Nintendo puts out.

1015
01:19:35,256 --> 01:19:41,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is almost like the same thing that GameStop does with their Wii accessories, where they charge $5 over retail for them.

1016
01:19:41,919 --> 01:19:45,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Because most consumers on the Wii don't know any better.

1017
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what it's going to come down to.

1018
01:19:47,281 --> 01:19:49,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, this Guitar Hero is $60 this time.

1019
01:19:50,382 --> 01:19:53,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well, I'll just pay $60, and that's what it's going to come down to.

1020
01:19:53,366 --> 01:19:59,253
[SPEAKER_06]: But if no one's really putting up a fuss about it, then yeah, people are going to start having to pay more.

1021
01:19:59,513 --> 01:20:05,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care, because like I said, I don't play these games on the Wii, so they can do whatever they want, but...

1022
01:20:06,758 --> 01:20:08,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking out for everybody else.

1023
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:17,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go back though and say quickly about the Xbox Live thing because there's a lot of people that think all the games should be $5 or that all the games should be no more than $10.

1024
01:20:18,508 --> 01:20:33,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look, how can you say that the games should all be $10 and then you turn around and plunk down $10.25, $10.50 even, $11 in some cities to go see a movie that might stink and it's only 90 minutes long to maybe two and a half hours.

1025
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:34,101
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1026
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:38,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I, honestly, I think a $15 price point for a lot of games is justified.

1027
01:20:38,683 --> 01:20:39,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of them.

1028
01:20:39,523 --> 01:20:42,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are real stinkers and don't have a thrill that lasts very long.

1029
01:20:42,724 --> 01:20:46,826
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think $15, hell, even $20 for some of the games is actually kind of justified.

1030
01:20:46,986 --> 01:20:47,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1031
01:20:48,047 --> 01:20:50,488
[SPEAKER_06]: What's good about Xbox Live and even the PlayStation Network?

1032
01:20:50,588 --> 01:20:51,168
[SPEAKER_06]: There's demos.

1033
01:20:51,408 --> 01:20:52,469
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check them out first.

1034
01:20:52,869 --> 01:20:57,451
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, whereas like a movie, you can't, I mean, I guess the trailer is sort of the demo for the movie, but...

1035
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:00,657
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't really check out Wii games.

1036
01:21:01,018 --> 01:21:08,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, you can probably get a good idea of what Guitar Hero 5 is going to be like and Beals Rock Band, but there are no demos on the Wii.

1037
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:09,408
[SPEAKER_06]: None.

1038
01:21:09,809 --> 01:21:10,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you go to a kiosk.

1039
01:21:11,414 --> 01:21:17,095
[SPEAKER_05]: which is too bad because I would actually probably buy more Wii things if I could demo them first.

1040
01:21:17,795 --> 01:21:22,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I've bought, I think, four games on the Wii, WiiWare.

1041
01:21:22,496 --> 01:21:25,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought that Bit.Trip Beat, and I need to get the new one.

1042
01:21:26,437 --> 01:21:35,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought Defend Your Castle, but that was only like a day one WiiWare, I want to see what a WiiWare game looks like type of thing, which, you know, wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great either.

1043
01:21:36,299 --> 01:21:38,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought the Gradius Reimagining, which was pretty cool.

1044
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

1045
01:21:41,445 --> 01:21:41,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1046
01:22:05,683 --> 01:22:08,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Joshi16 in chat says, the demo saved me $15 on Battlefield 1943.

1047
01:22:08,964 --> 01:22:11,325
[SPEAKER_05]: It isn't bad, just not for me.

1048
01:22:11,505 --> 01:22:16,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, again, I think we talked about, you know, Battlefield 1943 definitely appeals to fans of a certain genre.

1049
01:22:16,327 --> 01:22:28,611
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be fair, you know, with the Wii and music games are involved, they've actually been charging the same price points for bundles, like their, you know, instrument bundles and stuff like that.

1050
01:22:30,305 --> 01:22:31,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's fine.

1051
01:22:52,335 --> 01:22:55,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Bringing this up to everybody so that you notice because you might not have.

1052
01:22:55,917 --> 01:22:58,719
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it is a big deal and you should let them know if you don't like it.

1053
01:22:59,519 --> 01:23:02,241
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

1054
01:23:02,341 --> 01:23:06,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of one of those things where I really just want to let this guy rest in peace already.

1055
01:23:06,323 --> 01:23:08,164
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think we have to bring it up.

1056
01:23:08,244 --> 01:23:10,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a story about Michael Jackson.

1057
01:23:10,766 --> 01:23:16,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, what's going on right now, the MJJ Production Company, this is the...

1058
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:19,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Jackson's production company

1059
01:23:38,298 --> 01:24:00,425
[SPEAKER_05]: at MJJ Productions for several months and supposedly it's going to be out this holiday season so that's before he obviously died they were already working on this game they have not said what the game is no information about the developer what the heck it's about some people are wondering but they did say Michael Jackson loved games did you see the pictures of his arcade?

1060
01:24:00,525 --> 01:24:06,427
[SPEAKER_05]: dude I wanted to buy the Beatmania machine they were only asking like a thousand dollars for it I want the pinball tables

1061
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:12,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, but unfortunately now that he passed away, all that stuff's going to triple in value, so there's no way I can have it now.

1062
01:24:12,837 --> 01:24:16,658
[SPEAKER_05]: But if he had still been alive, I was so going to get that Beatmania machine.

1063
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,039
[SPEAKER_05]: How awesome would that be to own something that Michael Jackson once had?

1064
01:24:20,179 --> 01:24:21,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I was saving the money to get that Beatmania machine.

1065
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even kidding.

1066
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:23,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at it.

1067
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:26,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you what I've been bidding against you?

1068
01:24:26,601 --> 01:24:27,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

1069
01:24:28,382 --> 01:24:29,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't he have a DDR machine?

1070
01:24:29,462 --> 01:24:30,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he had a DDR machine.

1071
01:24:30,603 --> 01:24:31,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he did.

1072
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:32,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have totally bought that.

1073
01:24:32,553 --> 01:24:36,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, but regardless, unfortunately now, none of us are going to be able to afford that.

1074
01:24:36,574 --> 01:24:37,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want any of his arcade games.

1075
01:24:37,854 --> 01:24:39,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have room for arcade games.

1076
01:24:40,055 --> 01:24:40,775
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I do.

1077
01:24:40,795 --> 01:24:42,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I still want a DDR machine, though.

1078
01:24:42,295 --> 01:24:43,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I have that garage.

1079
01:24:43,255 --> 01:24:49,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I could totally... Wouldn't you love, in the OLR studio, at the old one anyway, a Beat Media machine sitting in the corner?

1080
01:24:50,017 --> 01:24:51,417
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not really all that hard to find.

1081
01:24:51,797 --> 01:24:52,517
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to know where to look.

1082
01:24:52,537 --> 01:24:54,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the one that Michael Jackson had.

1083
01:24:54,378 --> 01:24:55,758
[SPEAKER_05]: That's got a story behind it.

1084
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:58,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll forget it.

1085
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:01,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, here's the thing.

1086
01:25:02,154 --> 01:25:14,643
[SPEAKER_05]: One possible idea is that maybe this isn't a new game, but it could be like Moonwalker on Xbox Live Arcade, which considering the flurry of Genesis revivals we've seen is certainly a possibility.

1087
01:25:15,584 --> 01:25:21,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows, maybe even Space Channel 5, because Michael Jackson did play a role in Part 2, but somehow they didn't.

1088
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:24,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if anything it would be like... He had a major role in 2, though.

1089
01:25:25,031 --> 01:25:25,492
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1090
01:25:25,672 --> 01:25:30,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be like a music game that had to tie in with his new comeback tour that he was going to do.

1091
01:25:31,616 --> 01:25:32,057
[SPEAKER_06]: or something.

1092
01:25:32,397 --> 01:25:34,020
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Frisbee has an interesting comment in chat.

1093
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,582
[SPEAKER_05]: What about SingStar Michael Jackson?

1094
01:25:36,143 --> 01:25:37,305
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a bad thought.

1095
01:25:37,986 --> 01:25:38,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially now.

1096
01:25:38,647 --> 01:25:39,208
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be cool.

1097
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:42,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to see a Michael Jackson rock band game.

1098
01:25:43,837 --> 01:25:45,118
[SPEAKER_06]: would be so awesome.

1099
01:25:46,059 --> 01:25:49,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's inevitable you're going to see something maybe next year.

1100
01:25:50,542 --> 01:25:52,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that'll be the next rock band game.

1101
01:25:52,804 --> 01:25:54,965
[SPEAKER_05]: That would actually be pretty sweet, I've got to say.

1102
01:25:54,985 --> 01:25:55,586
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.

1103
01:25:55,846 --> 01:25:56,546
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

1104
01:25:57,987 --> 01:26:01,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Does a lot of his music cater to the rock band series of instruments?

1105
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:01,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

1106
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they played instruments, okay?

1107
01:26:04,612 --> 01:26:05,853
[SPEAKER_06]: They had guitars and drums.

1108
01:26:05,993 --> 01:26:06,393
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Slash.

1109
01:26:06,413 --> 01:26:07,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, it will work.

1110
01:26:07,674 --> 01:26:08,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

1111
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:10,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it could happen, but I mean...

1112
01:26:12,065 --> 01:26:23,728
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to talk about, since they went all out for the Beatles with the whole re-skinning and re-imagining of the game's interface, I think Michael Jackson is at that same level.

1113
01:26:23,768 --> 01:26:24,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Right up there with ABBA.

1114
01:26:27,689 --> 01:26:30,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, in all seriousness, Michael Jackson is definitely at that level.

1115
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:31,490
[SPEAKER_02]: If you change your mind.

1116
01:26:31,877 --> 01:26:32,057
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1117
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:32,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1118
01:26:33,137 --> 01:26:33,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Journey.

1119
01:26:34,778 --> 01:26:35,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the first in line?

1120
01:26:35,618 --> 01:26:35,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1121
01:26:36,518 --> 01:26:37,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Honey, I'm still free.

1122
01:26:37,598 --> 01:26:38,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, or Journey.

1123
01:26:38,338 --> 01:26:39,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a chance on Michael.

1124
01:26:39,378 --> 01:26:40,258
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's face it.

1125
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:47,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite my personal taste, Michael Jackson is universally at that level where I could see them doing a whole game about him.

1126
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:48,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1127
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:53,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa Cungusto in chat confirms there are guitar parts on 70% of his songs, believe it or not.

1128
01:26:54,261 --> 01:26:55,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that makes sense.

1129
01:26:55,261 --> 01:26:56,161
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I just made it.

1130
01:26:56,201 --> 01:26:57,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that a guitar her world tour?

1131
01:26:58,402 --> 01:26:58,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it really?

1132
01:26:59,002 --> 01:26:59,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1133
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:00,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1134
01:27:01,786 --> 01:27:03,848
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I hope it's not a Guitar Hero game.

1135
01:27:05,569 --> 01:27:07,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that sad that I say that?

1136
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's not Guitar Hero.

1137
01:27:08,592 --> 01:27:09,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's Rock Band.

1138
01:27:09,893 --> 01:27:15,157
[SPEAKER_05]: But just looking at the Beatles versus Van Halen, you can just tell which one had more effort put into it.

1139
01:27:15,177 --> 01:27:15,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1140
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:20,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, developers of Van Halen who spent time on it, but you just didn't spend enough time.

1141
01:27:21,923 --> 01:27:22,183
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1142
01:27:22,935 --> 01:27:25,076
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1143
01:27:50,819 --> 01:28:01,107
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic game of the week is Seiken Densetsu 3 and it is the sequel to what we got as Secret of Mana.

1144
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:04,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear a little clip.

1145
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:14,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now our adventures are in a little cave.

1146
01:28:14,636 --> 01:28:19,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sadly all of the music that I found was either tantra music or boss battle stuff.

1147
01:28:20,124 --> 01:28:21,746
[SPEAKER_03]: But I found this leading up to a boss battle.

1148
01:28:21,826 --> 01:28:23,368
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one I think was a boss battle.

1149
01:28:23,408 --> 01:28:24,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... I'll play that one.

1150
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:25,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1151
01:28:26,713 --> 01:28:30,174
[SPEAKER_03]: But this one is actually very unique.

1152
01:28:30,634 --> 01:28:32,375
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a bunch of different classes.

1153
01:28:32,415 --> 01:28:33,935
[SPEAKER_03]: You have six characters.

1154
01:28:34,015 --> 01:28:35,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Each of them have their own stories.

1155
01:28:36,036 --> 01:28:40,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And you play them in a combination.

1156
01:28:41,297 --> 01:28:46,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically the way that you start, it's got the same type of real-time combat.

1157
01:28:46,819 --> 01:28:49,380
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the same ring menu as Secret of Mana.

1158
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,901
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just different.

1159
01:28:52,981 --> 01:29:02,223
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got, of course, your magic attributes on each character that sort of changes exactly how well they can use certain things.

1160
01:29:02,763 --> 01:29:09,605
[SPEAKER_03]: You also can change your class by going light or dark, and then light-light, light-dark, dark-light, and dark-dark.

1161
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:38,677
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'd use a you'd change up the first one at level 18 with a mana stone or the next one is 38 with a special item so it's sort of different also with most of your enemies you can actually run away from them you can disengage your fight but your boss battles you pretty much end up locked in to your boss battles so you've got all that

1162
01:29:40,138 --> 01:29:48,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... You can, um... When you defeat all the enemies on screen, you can actually get a treasure chest, and it has a prize in it.

1163
01:29:49,887 --> 01:29:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's cool.

1164
01:29:51,768 --> 01:29:51,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1165
01:29:54,257 --> 01:30:21,153
[SPEAKER_03]: but the difference that instead of setting their range and aggression you actually set how they actually fight in battle like whether or not they want to do support or area effect or an individual target or if you're going to use your full power gauge or if you're going to use your full magic gauge or if they're going to use magic if you control how they cast their magic

1166
01:30:22,013 --> 01:30:28,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you've got your, um, as far as the leveling up, you've also got your, you know, like I said, the class system.

1167
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:35,058
[SPEAKER_03]: You can change to a light class or a dark class, and you've got different abilities based on each of those.

1168
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:46,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you also have a different day of the week, um, where an elemental spirit is in charge of that day, and based on that day, that type of magic will be stronger.

1169
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:47,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you have...

1170
01:30:48,363 --> 01:31:02,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Luna Day for Moon, Salamander Day for Fire, Undine Day for Water, Dryad Day for Wood, Djinn Day for Wind, Gnome Day for Earth, and Mana Holy Day where all of your magic is balanced.

1171
01:31:03,736 --> 01:31:10,140
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you'd have, of course, a different elemental showing on your screen to indicate what day it is.

1172
01:31:11,181 --> 01:31:16,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, with this one, you play as, um, different characters.

1173
01:31:17,084 --> 01:31:28,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they've actually been, um, there is a very fantastic fan translation, um, in English that actually even has all the in-game sprites translated into English.

1174
01:31:28,732 --> 01:31:31,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it is a 100% translation.

1175
01:31:32,794 --> 01:31:34,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when that first came out.

1176
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:36,596
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big fucking deal when that thing first came out.

1177
01:31:36,716 --> 01:31:37,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

1178
01:31:37,216 --> 01:31:37,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

1179
01:31:37,477 --> 01:31:38,357
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big, big deal.

1180
01:31:38,397 --> 01:31:50,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But your characters in this are... You have Angela, who is a princess with magic power.

1181
01:31:51,164 --> 01:31:53,345
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Duran, who is a swordsman.

1182
01:31:53,385 --> 01:31:55,486
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Hawkeye, who is a thief.

1183
01:31:59,769 --> 01:32:01,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Bryce, who is...

1184
01:32:03,912 --> 01:32:09,835
[SPEAKER_03]: from the Wind Kingdom, Kevin, you have Charlotte, the Dark Prince.

1185
01:32:10,415 --> 01:32:12,236
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got all these different characters.

1186
01:32:13,017 --> 01:32:17,299
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you start off with your six, you start off with a main character and then choose two to partner with them.

1187
01:32:17,959 --> 01:32:21,181
[SPEAKER_03]: So you are playing through different, you know, the story.

1188
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:27,224
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play through it a different time each time based on who your main person is and then who's having an out with them.

1189
01:32:28,087 --> 01:32:30,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty neat.

1190
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:39,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is, especially with that translation, it really is fantastic.

1191
01:32:39,881 --> 01:32:42,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is seriously the best play.

1192
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:45,387
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone who...

1193
01:32:47,310 --> 01:33:01,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the only way really to play this hack, unless you've got some kind of cartridge conversion kit, is through an emulator, and I can say right now it runs very, very well in the different ones that I've played it on.

1194
01:33:02,116 --> 01:33:03,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And it plays on Linux!

1195
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:06,271
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do good games on Linux.

1196
01:33:07,412 --> 01:33:09,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think it's well worthwhile.

1197
01:33:09,754 --> 01:33:13,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that boss right there.

1198
01:33:13,497 --> 01:33:14,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like a giant pumpkin head.

1199
01:33:14,738 --> 01:33:16,559
[SPEAKER_05]: But the actual name of the boss is Ms.

1200
01:33:16,659 --> 01:33:17,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Palm.

1201
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,502
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the bosses in the game is Jenova.

1202
01:33:21,103 --> 01:33:23,064
[SPEAKER_03]: With a G instead of a J. Nice.

1203
01:33:24,085 --> 01:33:24,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1204
01:33:25,286 --> 01:33:33,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally think that it is... I think, honestly, for SNES RPGs, this one is about the pinnacle.

1205
01:33:34,471 --> 01:33:39,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I apologize if I missed it somewhere in your review, but any word on why Square didn't release this over here?

1206
01:33:40,819 --> 01:33:41,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1207
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pure stupidity?

1208
01:33:44,243 --> 01:33:44,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Lack of faith?

1209
01:33:45,784 --> 01:33:48,548
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that Secret of Evermore did not live up to expectations?

1210
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:56,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um, actually, um, I'm trying to do some look over.

1211
01:33:56,384 --> 01:34:05,472
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that, um, that Secret of Evermore was supposed to have been Seiken Densetsu 3, but they brought out something else?

1212
01:34:05,592 --> 01:34:06,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know the whole...

1213
01:34:07,453 --> 01:34:11,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Secret of Evermore was Square USA.

1214
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the only games Square USA ever did.

1215
01:34:13,918 --> 01:34:16,680
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be the only game Square USA ever did.

1216
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't do that hot over here.

1217
01:34:19,822 --> 01:34:20,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I owned it.

1218
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:21,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a bad game.

1219
01:34:22,304 --> 01:34:24,966
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not super.

1220
01:34:26,053 --> 01:34:40,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, part of the other reason is that they were saying that Square was deciding not to translate any more titles for a long time, and they said that it would have been too costly to produce.

1221
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:42,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1222
01:34:43,509 --> 01:34:48,791
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, hey, someone, you know, picked it up and did it.

1223
01:34:49,051 --> 01:35:04,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly would love to see them buy the fan translation, you know, pay for the time and effort that went into translating it, and bring it out on the DS.

1224
01:35:04,537 --> 01:35:05,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1225
01:35:30,506 --> 01:35:34,949
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but there's plenty more of the show to come.

1226
01:35:34,989 --> 01:35:36,210
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to take a quick break.

1227
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:37,632
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back in just a little bit.

1228
01:35:37,972 --> 01:35:40,574
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got still more stories to talk about in Part B tonight.

1229
01:35:40,594 --> 01:35:53,424
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Rapid Fire News, your emails, the FUs of the week, and some more stories, including a story on Scribblenauts, and, wait for it, nudity in Part B. That's right, we're going to get naked in Part B tonight.

1230
01:35:53,464 --> 01:35:55,005
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just kidding, but we're going to talk about nudity.

1231
01:35:55,605 --> 01:35:58,668
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1232
01:36:04,943 --> 01:36:05,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_03]: You can customize your team names.

1237
01:37:23,311 --> 01:37:25,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, it's worms.

1238
01:37:26,193 --> 01:37:28,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to be Team Worm, you can.

1239
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:30,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be Team Wiggle Worm if you want.

1240
01:37:30,635 --> 01:37:31,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather be dewormed.

1241
01:37:33,937 --> 01:37:34,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh.

1242
01:37:34,457 --> 01:37:35,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I be Team Worm in my pants?

1243
01:37:37,599 --> 01:37:37,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh.

1244
01:37:39,676 --> 01:37:41,177
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some Xbox stuff?

1245
01:37:41,997 --> 01:37:46,299
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox Live Arcade Summer of Arcade Games has dates.

01:38:00,485 --> 01:38:06,028
[SPEAKER_03]: August 5th is Explosion Man and it's a character who can explode himself at will.

1249
01:38:07,009 --> 01:38:09,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he gets very angry and explodes himself.

1250
01:38:09,730 --> 01:38:11,951
[SPEAKER_05]: That musical cue is entirely planned.

1251

01:39:29,819 --> 01:39:30,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1264
01:39:31,444 --> 01:39:35,676
[SPEAKER_06]: What's also interesting, though, is before that got announced, there was actually...

1265
01:39:37,915 --> 01:39:38,615
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1266
01:40:02,661 --> 01:40:25,053
[SPEAKER_06]: or not all of all of the things that on the rumor list ended up being on the confirmed list right yes okay just want to make sure that's clear yes um of course uh you know Queen and David Bowie Under Pressure um let's see here also a couple Tom Petty songs uh Tom Petty Running Down a Dream uh Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers American Girl um

1267
01:40:26,334 --> 01:40:32,479
[SPEAKER_06]: They even have the gorillas in the game with Feel Good Ink, which will be kind of interesting.

1268
01:40:33,339 --> 01:40:39,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Blursong2, Bon Jovi You Give Love a Bad Name, and many, many more.

1269
01:40:42,900 --> 01:41:00,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say, if that is real, which it sounds like it is It's actually a pretty freaking good list for Guitar Hero As much crap as I've given the Guitar Hero franchise I will say this song list does make me want to buy Guitar Hero 5 It's a pretty good song list Assuming that it's all correct Which it probably is Yes

1270
01:41:02,296 --> 01:41:04,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then a little bit of bad news.

1271
01:41:04,437 --> 01:41:09,198
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about last week that there was a rumor that maybe the PSP Go was a little bit faster.

1272
01:41:09,838 --> 01:41:13,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that, you know, they may have upped the processor to 480 MHz.

1273
01:41:14,179 --> 01:41:16,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, unfortunately that wouldn't be the case.

1274
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:21,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, actually that processor speed was referring to the USB speed and not the CPU.

1275
01:41:21,861 --> 01:41:25,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, the PSP Go is still not worth your $250.

1276
01:41:25,082 --> 01:41:25,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1277
01:41:25,202 --> 01:41:25,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then finally, um,

1278
01:41:31,747 --> 01:42:01,376
[SPEAKER_06]: EA made a boo-boo this week posting on their Twitter an announcement for Command & Conquer 4 and kind of jumping the gun a bit actually it did get later officially announced in the next coming days but apparently it was kind of funny because they had the announcement EA Los Angeles announces the development of Command & Conquer 4 and then they had a link to a press release that wasn't there yet so later they added a press release and it was announced dope

1279
01:42:02,489 --> 01:42:03,269
[SPEAKER_06]: But still funny.

1280
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:05,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't you a big fan of Command & Conquer?

1281
01:42:06,311 --> 01:42:10,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I haven't really... I'm a fan of Red Alert, and I actually skipped the last one.

1282
01:42:11,774 --> 01:42:17,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, but... Yeah, I'm a fan of editing those to death, just like I do Grand Theft Auto 4.

1283
01:42:18,778 --> 01:42:19,058
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1284
01:42:19,414 --> 01:42:20,855
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1285
01:42:41,814 --> 01:43:06,462
[SPEAKER_05]: on his Twitter actually Quan Chi who is from Mortal Kombat 4 originally the character design for that character showed up on his Twitter so it looks like there was definitely some stuff planned unfortunately now though according to Ed Boon quote right now I don't see it happening apparently all the code though for the characters was just about done but unfortunately now all the attention is focused on Mortal Kombat 9 I guess you can thank all of Midway's recent troubles for that

1286
01:43:07,502 --> 01:43:12,648
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that you can download right now, though, for free even, Elder Scrolls 2, Daggerfall.

1287
01:43:12,908 --> 01:43:18,013
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have heard of Elder Scrolls 4, Oblivion, because that was a huge game a couple years ago, and I'm sure Elder Scrolls 5.

1288
01:43:18,754 --> 01:43:23,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised there's not been an announcement of this, but I guess Fallout 3 was where Bethesda was putting all their resources.

1289
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:27,302
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm pretty sure next year, I bet you next E3 you're going to see Elder Scrolls 5.

1290
01:43:27,382 --> 01:43:27,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

1291
01:43:29,324 --> 01:43:30,064
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1292
01:43:58,581 --> 01:44:20,523
[SPEAKER_05]: one more story for you guys tonight that has to do with the ever asked about Kid Icarus game apparently somebody had asked Miyamoto about it at E3 and his response WAIT PLEASE actually he didn't say it really like that I just said it that way for dramatic effect but he did say wait please I'm really surprised how popular that is but you're the first person to ask this at E3 was apparently his comment about that

1293
01:44:20,803 --> 01:44:22,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe that was the first time.

1294
01:44:22,244 --> 01:44:25,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was the first time someone had the balls to ask him about it at E3.

1295
01:44:25,465 --> 01:44:26,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know it's something a lot of people are asking.

1296
01:44:26,905 --> 01:44:28,786
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first time that you've asked me about that.

1297
01:44:29,266 --> 01:44:29,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently.

1298
01:44:30,687 --> 01:44:31,967
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but that's better than no.

1299
01:44:32,608 --> 01:44:33,108
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

1300
01:44:33,128 --> 01:44:36,049
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are maybe reading a bit too much into that.

1301
01:44:36,429 --> 01:44:37,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, please.

1302
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:40,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, I love that response.

1303
01:44:40,451 --> 01:44:41,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to use that.

1304
01:44:41,231 --> 01:44:42,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to use that on the show more often.

1305
01:44:42,912 --> 01:44:43,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, please.

1306
01:44:45,733 --> 01:44:47,554
[SPEAKER_05]: It does seem a little bit hopeful, but I don't know.

1307
01:44:48,454 --> 01:44:48,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1308
01:44:50,523 --> 01:44:51,144
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see though.

1309
01:44:51,304 --> 01:44:55,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps that's another thing that's coming to E3 2010, but of course that's just what all the fanboys think.

1310
01:44:55,528 --> 01:44:55,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

1311
01:44:56,069 --> 01:44:56,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, please.

1312
01:44:58,471 --> 01:45:00,233
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just like as Frisbee says in chat.

1313
01:45:00,273 --> 01:45:00,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Heal, please.

1314
01:45:03,436 --> 01:45:04,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Cure, please.

1315
01:45:04,918 --> 01:45:05,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, please.

1316
01:45:06,701 --> 01:45:07,601
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the game, please?

1317
01:45:08,041 --> 01:45:09,242
[SPEAKER_05]: How about emails, please?

1318
01:45:09,362 --> 01:45:14,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send us your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we take a few of them and we read them right here on the show.

1319
01:45:15,003 --> 01:45:22,905
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag head first, pull out some of her favorite emails and read them for you tonight in our mailbag segment.

1320
01:45:23,045 --> 01:45:23,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, what the hell?

1321
01:45:23,785 --> 01:45:25,065
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the mailbag song.

1322
01:45:25,205 --> 01:45:25,926
[SPEAKER_05]: What the crap?

1323
01:45:26,826 --> 01:45:27,586
[SPEAKER_05]: How about this instead?

1324
01:45:27,626 --> 01:45:28,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here is the mailbag song.

1325
01:45:29,206 --> 01:45:29,847
[SPEAKER_05]: There, much better.

1326
01:45:31,187 --> 01:45:32,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct song, please.

1327
01:45:33,107 --> 01:45:33,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1328
01:45:33,948 --> 01:45:34,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, please!

1329
01:45:36,584 --> 01:45:38,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at Orangelandreda.com DarkSakura

1330
01:46:07,284 --> 01:46:07,785
[SPEAKER_03]: For what?

1331
01:46:09,086 --> 01:46:09,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1332
01:46:10,907 --> 01:46:12,408
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way... Explanation, please.

1333
01:46:12,828 --> 01:46:15,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had 3D games that used glasses.

1334
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:16,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1335
01:46:16,930 --> 01:46:18,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We had... The Virtual Boy.

1336
01:46:19,892 --> 01:46:20,573
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't count.

1337
01:46:20,933 --> 01:46:22,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about Master System games.

1338
01:46:23,735 --> 01:46:24,215
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember?

1339
01:46:24,775 --> 01:46:25,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1340
01:46:25,116 --> 01:46:27,337
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the 3D glasses for the Master System games.

1341
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,381
[SPEAKER_03]: and a few NES games.

1342
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:33,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there was a version of... Rad Racer had 3D.

1343
01:46:33,823 --> 01:46:39,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a game that actually was a predecessor to Space Harrier.

1344
01:46:40,167 --> 01:46:43,189
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Adventure 3D World or something.

1345
01:46:43,549 --> 01:46:44,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, 3D World Runner.

1346
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:45,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that game.

1347
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:46,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Hooper.

1348
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's been out and it's failed.

1349
01:46:51,362 --> 01:46:56,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but a lot of those were just like little, they were flash-in-the-pan stupid things.

1350
01:46:57,025 --> 01:47:10,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, let's say there was a legitimate console based around, and let's face it, technology's come a long way since the days of the amazing red, I'm sorry, the amazing red seizure-inducing headache machine, aka the Virtual Boy.

1351
01:47:10,932 --> 01:47:12,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Technology's come a long way since then.

1352
01:47:12,913 --> 01:47:14,274
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what if they did

1353
01:47:15,234 --> 01:47:16,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at what they're doing with a lot of 3D movies.

1354
01:47:17,295 --> 01:47:20,317
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't seen Up in 3D, it's actually pretty cool.

1355
01:47:20,397 --> 01:47:28,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of these technologies that they're doing with 3D movies, I could see something like this going towards video gaming in the near future, perhaps in the next generation of consoles.

1356
01:47:28,861 --> 01:47:33,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's more what our emailer is asking about, maybe not so much this flash-in-the-pan crap we've seen in the past.

1357
01:47:33,883 --> 01:47:37,025
[SPEAKER_05]: What if they built a whole new console with today's technology out of 3D gaming?

1358
01:47:37,265 --> 01:47:38,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be something you'd be interested in?

1359
01:47:38,986 --> 01:47:41,607
[SPEAKER_05]: My honest answer is no, because 3D gaming...

1360
01:47:41,747 --> 01:47:47,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw Nightmare in 3D twice, so I really think the 3D just, it suits movies more, it really does, or like those little 3D rides like, you know, the Muppet Show in 3D, that type of thing.

1361
01:48:05,311 --> 01:48:06,772
[SPEAKER_03]: or Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

1362
01:48:07,272 --> 01:48:08,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my honest answer.

1363
01:48:09,453 --> 01:48:15,076
[SPEAKER_05]: If I see the game that convinces me I need the 3D, then I'll be a little more sold on it.

1364
01:48:15,116 --> 01:48:20,399
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's one of those things where I think the great 3D game idea hasn't been fully realized yet.

1365
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:21,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But who knows?

1366
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:23,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a possibility in the future?

1367
01:48:23,201 --> 01:48:23,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

1368
01:48:23,881 --> 01:48:25,302
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to see 3D games again.

1369
01:48:25,842 --> 01:48:26,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a matter of time.

1370
01:48:28,664 --> 01:48:30,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We're inching closer and closer to the holodeck.

1371
01:48:32,152 --> 01:48:32,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish.

1372
01:48:34,473 --> 01:48:38,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up is from Robert M. Thank you very much for getting the podcast caught up.

1373
01:48:39,295 --> 01:48:49,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Lately I haven't been able to tune in live due to long work hours as your show here in the Midwest runs until 11pm and I get up around 5am to get ready for the bus.

1374
01:48:49,658 --> 01:48:57,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering why Blackwolf isn't yet caught up with his show especially since he's able to get his Friday night show on the feed the next day like clockwork.

1375
01:48:58,101 --> 01:48:59,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking forward to this week's show.

1376
01:49:00,792 --> 01:49:02,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't answer for anybody else.

1377
01:49:02,313 --> 01:49:05,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, we can't answer for anybody else, but we will say it's a lot of work.

1378
01:49:05,896 --> 01:49:17,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know for a fact he does edit the show, not in a way that's going to edit the content of the show, but he does it to make it sound very professional.

1379
01:49:17,704 --> 01:49:21,687
[SPEAKER_05]: He takes out a lot of the dead air and things that we really should do, but are too lazy to.

1380
01:49:22,848 --> 01:49:23,488
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of work.

1381
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:28,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys think it's just easy to slap it together and put it on the podcast, but it does take me a good...

1382
01:49:28,752 --> 01:49:29,292
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1383
01:49:50,757 --> 01:49:58,081
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, and I'm sure for Bobby who edits his show even further for contextual purposes, it's even more so.

1384
01:49:58,321 --> 01:50:00,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, cut the dude some slack.

1385
01:50:00,242 --> 01:50:01,523
[SPEAKER_05]: He works hard doing two shows.

1386
01:50:02,402 --> 01:50:14,468
[SPEAKER_03]: One more quick note, I gave my impressions of Phase a year or so ago, and recently upgraded my old video iPod due to dead pixels to an 80GB iPod Classic.

1387
01:50:15,089 --> 01:50:24,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It really improves playing games, the older unit had to search for the games and would usually give a game could not be played message before finally successfully loading.

1388
01:50:25,274 --> 01:50:27,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the game loads on this immediately on the classic.

1389
01:50:27,775 --> 01:50:29,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the battery life is far improved.

1390
01:50:29,897 --> 01:50:41,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Between the solitaire game that comes with it and recently the iPod version, not to be confused with the iPhone one of Peggle, it's admittedly been a while since I've played my DS Lite.

1391
01:50:41,683 --> 01:50:42,063
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

1392
01:50:42,283 --> 01:50:47,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably won't get LEGO Rock Band, but I would get a Rock Band LEGO set in a heartbeat.

1393
01:50:49,352 --> 01:50:53,093
[SPEAKER_05]: It is interesting how far iPod gaming has come.

1394
01:50:53,993 --> 01:50:57,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, FaZe is only, what, like a year and a half, two years old?

1395
01:50:57,414 --> 01:50:59,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very interesting to see how far the games have come.

1396
01:51:00,035 --> 01:51:04,976
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've gone from FaZe to TapTap Revenge to, you know, Peggle on the iPhone is pretty sweet.

1397
01:51:05,596 --> 01:51:09,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you guys got it during the 99 cent deal because at a buck is a steal.

1398
01:51:09,217 --> 01:51:09,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Way got that.

1399
01:51:10,257 --> 01:51:11,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Way got that.

1400
01:51:13,038 --> 01:51:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I don't know if you... We tried to post about it on the Twitter because I don't think we had it during a show time.

1401
01:51:17,763 --> 01:51:22,727
[SPEAKER_05]: But Columns and Puyo Puyo was free for a limited time over the 4th of July weekend.

1402
01:51:23,368 --> 01:51:23,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

1403
01:51:23,869 --> 01:51:25,430
[SPEAKER_03]: You texted me about that.

1404
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:26,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be honest.

1405
01:51:26,811 --> 01:51:28,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't a fan of how the game controlled.

1406
01:51:28,853 --> 01:51:29,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't try it.

1407
01:51:29,534 --> 01:51:29,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Yaris

1408
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:49,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Last email from Dan Shadow.

1409
01:52:13,584 --> 01:52:19,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, the Strong Bad games weren't even announced at that point, not to mention a forthcoming announcement on Wallace and Gromit.

1410
01:52:20,012 --> 01:52:22,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember mentioning how cool Monkey Island and Loom were.

1411
01:52:23,196 --> 01:52:26,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here I am, a year later, waiting to play a brand new Monkey Island game.

1412
01:52:26,941 --> 01:52:29,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to give a toast to video games and how...

1413
01:52:30,525 --> 01:52:33,967
[SPEAKER_03]: They bring us such joy before popping the cork on episode one.

1414
01:52:34,567 --> 01:52:45,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want you guys to pat yourselves on the back to always being there for being the outsiders looking into the world of video games and for making a lengthy show that helps me in the long hours of work.

1415
01:52:45,753 --> 01:52:51,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know that OLR is a special tab that people cannot add to their personalized Yahoo front page?

1416
01:52:52,136 --> 01:52:53,277
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I found the show.

1417
01:52:54,237 --> 01:52:55,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely by accident.

1418
01:52:55,578 --> 01:52:56,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Accidentally awesome.

1419
01:52:56,618 --> 01:52:56,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1420
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:57,999
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you do that?

1421
01:52:58,119 --> 01:52:59,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never even heard of that.

1422
01:52:59,240 --> 01:52:59,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1423
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's RSS feeds.

1424
01:53:03,004 --> 01:53:03,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1425
01:53:03,484 --> 01:53:05,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I never really looked into that.

1426
01:53:05,266 --> 01:53:05,647
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

1427
01:53:06,288 --> 01:53:06,688
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

1428
01:53:07,289 --> 01:53:12,755
[SPEAKER_03]: The email I sent a while back about chocolate and flowers, that was a punch-out Wii reference.

1429
01:53:13,666 --> 01:53:16,609
[SPEAKER_03]: PPS, I heard Loom is coming out on Steam soon, is that true?

1430
01:53:16,969 --> 01:53:36,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh hell yeah, my ass has downloaded it already Oh god, yeah, like a ton of the LucasArts stuff came out this week I'll tell you what, I came close to buying Loom on freaking TurboGrafx Nice I found a place in town that has it, but they want like 35 bucks for it Still I'm close, I'm close What store is that?

1431
01:53:38,067 --> 01:53:38,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay

1432
01:53:39,419 --> 01:53:40,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving them advertising.

1433
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:41,681
[SPEAKER_03]: She told me off air just now.

1434
01:53:41,761 --> 01:53:44,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving... I'll go ahead and say it.

1435
01:53:44,904 --> 01:53:45,744
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fair game.

1436
01:53:46,565 --> 01:53:47,526
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty good guys.

1437
01:53:47,626 --> 01:53:51,849
[SPEAKER_03]: A little high priced, but... They have arcade machines in their store, which is kind of fun.

1438
01:53:52,129 --> 01:53:52,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1439
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:52,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1440
01:53:52,930 --> 01:53:53,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been there.

1441
01:53:53,711 --> 01:53:55,552
[SPEAKER_05]: In all the years I've... I've only been there once.

1442
01:53:55,732 --> 01:53:55,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1443
01:53:56,193 --> 01:53:56,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I should check it out.

1444
01:53:56,673 --> 01:53:57,454
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell Saturn games.

1445
01:53:58,054 --> 01:54:01,637
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going to go to... They actually do case mods and they do disc resurfacing.

1446
01:54:01,917 --> 01:54:09,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff and I were going to go to Deny House today, but the realist in me knew I wouldn't be able to get out of bed early enough to go because it's the weekend and this is where I catch up on my sleep.

1447
01:54:09,905 --> 01:54:11,927
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't they sell arcade games out there once in a while, too?

1448
01:54:12,828 --> 01:54:13,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1449
01:54:15,051 --> 01:54:16,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go on a spree at Denyos, just wait.

1450
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:18,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Trader Dan moved out there too, I think.

1451
01:54:18,514 --> 01:54:18,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1452
01:54:19,095 --> 01:54:21,276
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't sell full-size arcade games out there.

1453
01:54:21,477 --> 01:54:21,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1454
01:54:22,157 --> 01:54:22,357
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1455
01:54:22,598 --> 01:54:30,745
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be hard-pressed to find that stuff, because you'd have to have... I found cocktail tables and sit-down ones there the last time I went to Denyos.

1456
01:54:30,765 --> 01:54:36,590
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this one guy that's outside of the flea market proper that has arcade games.

1457
01:54:37,450 --> 01:54:39,752
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like in that little outside place where the guy sells the mini-donuts.

1458
01:54:39,953 --> 01:54:40,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1459
01:54:40,593 --> 01:54:42,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been to Niall's in like six years.

1460
01:54:42,714 --> 01:54:46,156
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, it's a giant flea market, by the way, for those that have no idea what I'm talking about.

1461
01:54:46,596 --> 01:54:48,056
[SPEAKER_05]: A little place here locally in town.

1462
01:54:50,157 --> 01:54:52,839
[SPEAKER_03]: But we actually did just buy a game from Fair Game.

1463
01:54:53,139 --> 01:54:55,980
[SPEAKER_03]: We bought Captain America and the Avengers for Genesis.

1464
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:56,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1465
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the SNES one is ass!

1466
01:54:59,642 --> 01:55:03,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan totally reminded me of something, and I totally think this is the truest thing.

1467
01:55:03,904 --> 01:55:08,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny when you go fight the Mandarin, and he's like, Behold my power!

1468
01:55:08,065 --> 01:55:09,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you kill him in five seconds.

1469
01:55:10,962 --> 01:55:12,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1470
01:55:36,508 --> 01:55:39,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So make sure in your emails you tell us your opinion on anything you send us.

1471
01:55:40,009 --> 01:55:40,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's cool.

1472
01:55:41,429 --> 01:55:45,370
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't want to say don't send us stories because sometimes we do get some cool stuff that we hadn't heard.

1473
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:51,292
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it was a big story that ran on every blog, yes, we probably heard of it and are talking about it during the show.

1474
01:55:51,872 --> 01:55:52,812
[SPEAKER_05]: But we want to know your thoughts.

1475
01:55:53,032 --> 01:55:54,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always about your voice.

1476
01:55:54,353 --> 01:55:55,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Every gamer has a voice, remember?

1477
01:55:56,013 --> 01:55:59,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So mailback at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.

1478
01:56:00,334 --> 01:56:06,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about some more gaming stories with a few more stories before your phone calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1479
01:56:06,936 --> 01:56:08,717
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got about five stories for you guys first.

1480
01:56:08,797 --> 01:56:09,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1481
01:56:09,637 --> 01:56:11,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh, it's another rumor about PSP 2.

1482
01:56:12,438 --> 01:56:13,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my goodness.

1483
01:56:14,018 --> 01:56:19,860
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, of course, you know, with the PSP Go coming out, I guess they've got to be working on a sequel to that.

1484
01:56:20,626 --> 01:56:21,706
[SPEAKER_06]: because hey, why not?

1485
01:56:22,666 --> 01:56:41,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, the rumor is that the PSP2 is apparently already in development and that according to some inside info that Eurogamer is allegedly claiming that they got their hands on information that imagine technology's power VR tech will be an important part of the device.

1486
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:46,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is without getting into too many technical specifics.

1487
01:56:46,491 --> 01:56:48,972
[SPEAKER_06]: The chip codename Hydra will allow for 133 million polygons

1488
01:56:50,572 --> 01:56:52,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1489
01:57:07,205 --> 01:57:09,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's not bad.

1490
01:57:09,707 --> 01:57:12,990
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, PlayStation 2 quality graphics, it kind of makes sense.

1491
01:57:14,051 --> 01:57:22,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently the chip, I guess, will act as both the GPU and CPU simultaneously, increasing power efficiency and helping the other areas of the programming for the device.

1492
01:57:24,279 --> 01:57:25,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just rumor right now.

1493
01:57:26,332 --> 01:57:26,892
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.

1494
01:57:46,806 --> 01:57:50,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still not fully sure I understand what the Hydra chip does.

1495
01:57:50,087 --> 01:57:51,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not as big into hardware stuff.

1496
01:57:51,748 --> 01:57:53,909
[SPEAKER_05]: What exactly will the Hydra chip mean for this system?

1497
01:57:54,129 --> 01:58:00,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's just a powerful chip that's going to process both the graphics stuff and the actual game processing.

1498
01:58:01,412 --> 01:58:07,355
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a chip that's using PowerVR technology.

1499
01:58:08,715 --> 01:58:12,037
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to basically make games look like the PlayStation 2

1500
01:58:13,621 --> 01:58:15,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Able to be played on a portable system.

1501
01:58:15,281 --> 01:58:16,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But will it blend?

1502
01:58:17,022 --> 01:58:17,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything blends.

1503
01:58:18,142 --> 01:58:18,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1504
01:58:19,162 --> 01:58:20,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the important thing, I guess.

1505
01:58:20,643 --> 01:58:25,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting, though, that we are getting all these details about the PSP2 with the PSP Go still on the horizon.

1506
01:58:25,664 --> 01:58:28,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is something that's happened at Sony camp before.

1507
01:58:28,764 --> 01:58:34,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to pinpoint that that only happens to Sony, because I seem to remember this whole little, like... The Gizmodo?

1508
01:58:34,966 --> 01:58:39,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you kind of hear about these things, or the newer N-Gage while the other N-Gage was still out, you know...

1509
01:58:40,167 --> 01:58:41,028
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the Gizmondo.

1510
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:48,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, by the way, we're going to release a widescreen version of the system before the actual system comes out.

1511
01:58:49,334 --> 01:58:50,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that didn't help.

1512
01:58:50,935 --> 01:58:55,278
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in chat says, a graphic chip that powerful also means low battery life.

1513
01:58:57,145 --> 01:58:58,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they figure out something, you know.

1514
01:58:59,507 --> 01:59:00,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what if this is just a unit?

1515
01:59:00,808 --> 01:59:04,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm surprised we don't see a unit that just plugs right into the wall.

1516
01:59:04,891 --> 01:59:07,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not even talking about with a charger or anything like that.

1517
01:59:07,513 --> 01:59:10,575
[SPEAKER_05]: You just flip out the little plug thing and just plug it right in the wall.

1518
01:59:10,895 --> 01:59:11,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be cool?

1519
01:59:12,817 --> 01:59:14,238
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's supposed to be a portable system.

1520
01:59:14,278 --> 01:59:15,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the hell do I have to be tethered to a wall?

1521
01:59:15,739 --> 01:59:16,039
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

1522
01:59:16,199 --> 01:59:16,760
[SPEAKER_05]: To charge it.

1523
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the battery is built in.

1524
01:59:19,101 --> 01:59:19,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a cell phone.

1525
01:59:20,202 --> 01:59:20,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it should be.

1526
01:59:21,314 --> 01:59:22,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it should be.

1527
01:59:22,775 --> 01:59:28,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they couldn't sell you the replacement batteries or the upgrade batteries or all the other fun stuff.

1528
01:59:28,477 --> 01:59:34,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not even talking about, like, okay, because probably folks are going, you retard DS and PSP do that where you plug them into the wall.

1529
01:59:34,459 --> 01:59:36,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about without even an AC adapter.

1530
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:41,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you just flick out the little, like, you know, I don't, you flick out the little plug in the back and just plug it right in your wall.

1531
01:59:41,222 --> 01:59:42,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Like your cell phone, like you said.

1532
01:59:42,623 --> 01:59:44,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, not all cell phones have that either.

1533
01:59:45,124 --> 01:59:45,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1534
01:59:45,544 --> 01:59:45,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1535
01:59:46,741 --> 02:00:02,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's... Why don't they do something like... Well, actually, they're sort of working on technology for that, where you can charge stuff wirelessly, where you actually have... For example, they have Wii batteries that you can get for the remotes that will actually charge through...

1536
02:00:03,971 --> 02:00:04,391
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.

1537
02:00:04,911 --> 02:00:06,112
[SPEAKER_06]: That is scary.

1538
02:00:06,192 --> 02:00:07,292
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that work?

1539
02:00:07,392 --> 02:00:07,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1540
02:00:08,273 --> 02:00:09,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Black magic, apparently.

1541
02:00:10,674 --> 02:00:11,734
[SPEAKER_06]: That is, wow.

1542
02:00:11,754 --> 02:00:13,035
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, they have them.

1543
02:00:13,615 --> 02:00:14,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they sell them now.

1544
02:00:15,036 --> 02:00:15,596
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy them.

1545
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:19,877
[SPEAKER_06]: You basically sit the controller onto the pad.

1546
02:00:19,937 --> 02:00:21,418
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have any contacts.

1547
02:00:21,458 --> 02:00:23,959
[SPEAKER_06]: You can leave that stupid silicon thing on it and stuff.

1548
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:27,681
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently it charges through the air.

1549
02:00:28,401 --> 02:00:33,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of scary because I don't want electricity flying through the air and electrocuting me, you know.

1550
02:00:34,451 --> 02:00:36,613
[SPEAKER_05]: That is kind of strange how that works.

1551
02:00:36,753 --> 02:00:37,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Technology's weird.

1552
02:00:37,974 --> 02:00:41,637
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I want to say Energizer had... Frisbee says it's powered by hamsters.

1553
02:00:42,818 --> 02:00:50,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to believe that, that there's miniature hamsters and those things that power them instead of electricity flying through the air like a bad science fiction movie.

1554
02:00:50,265 --> 02:00:52,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see if I can find the information on it because it's just...

1555
02:00:53,427 --> 02:00:55,588
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it sound like... Remember those globes?

1556
02:00:55,688 --> 02:00:58,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure they still have them, but they were popular when I was a kid.

1557
02:00:59,610 --> 02:01:03,312
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd see on Mr. Wizard's World and shit, the big globes that had the lightning in them.

1558
02:01:03,352 --> 02:01:04,112
[SPEAKER_11]: This still does at Spencer's, Rob.

1559
02:01:04,152 --> 02:01:07,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you put your fingers on the edge of them, the lightning bolts jump to your fingers.

1560
02:01:07,854 --> 02:01:11,315
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I think of when I hear this whole charging through the air.

1561
02:01:11,555 --> 02:01:14,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my house is going to turn into one of those globes.

1562
02:01:16,237 --> 02:01:16,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's...

1563
02:01:19,167 --> 02:01:22,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I know... Oh, this is one of them, I think.

1564
02:01:23,631 --> 02:01:25,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it the InCharge?

1565
02:01:27,574 --> 02:01:28,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's not one.

1566
02:01:28,735 --> 02:01:29,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

1567
02:01:29,535 --> 02:01:32,458
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I want to say it was Energizer or something like that that put it out.

1568
02:01:32,538 --> 02:01:33,839
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one battery company.

1569
02:01:33,899 --> 02:01:35,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember who put it out.

1570
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:38,863
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's crazy looking.

1571
02:01:39,223 --> 02:01:39,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Energizer.

1572
02:01:39,843 --> 02:01:40,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

1573
02:01:40,724 --> 02:01:44,227
[SPEAKER_06]: It uses induction charging, is what it is.

1574
02:01:44,727 --> 02:01:44,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1575
02:01:48,463 --> 02:01:59,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Energizer Wiimote Wireless Induction Charger That's scary shit Black magic I say, it's black magic It's a witch!

1576
02:02:01,383 --> 02:02:01,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn the witch!

1577
02:02:02,044 --> 02:02:03,285
[SPEAKER_03]: We found a witch, may we burn her?

1578
02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:06,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Age Origins

1579
02:02:30,948 --> 02:02:38,654
[SPEAKER_05]: and apparently Bioware is currently debating if the game should contain full frontal nudity because the game does have some sex scenes in it.

1580
02:02:38,874 --> 02:02:39,594
[SPEAKER_05]: More cock!

1581
02:02:40,515 --> 02:02:45,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apparently the sex will be portrayed in cutscene-controlled environments only.

1582
02:02:45,799 --> 02:02:52,564
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not going to be any type of gameplay, so sorry, no hot coffee minigame where you control the thrusting or what have you.

1583
02:02:52,624 --> 02:02:54,125
[SPEAKER_05]: It's part of the cinematics.

1584
02:02:54,745 --> 02:02:58,788
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently in the game, you are going to be able to have sex with computer-controlled party members and

1585
02:02:59,088 --> 02:03:01,690
[SPEAKER_05]: in order to improve your relationship with them.

1586
02:03:02,791 --> 02:03:03,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Like real life.

1587
02:03:05,333 --> 02:03:10,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, this game was actually shown to the press behind closed doors at E3, so that means we wouldn't have seen it.

1588
02:03:10,817 --> 02:03:13,660
[SPEAKER_05]: But the sex scenes were not shown in full.

1589
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:16,842
[SPEAKER_05]: They were cut very short after they started.

1590
02:03:17,242 --> 02:03:20,185
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, of course, Mass Effect allowed the characters to have sex.

1591
02:03:20,505 --> 02:03:21,286
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

1592
02:03:22,046 --> 02:03:27,490
[SPEAKER_05]: When VideoGamer.com asked the BioWare vice president, Greg Zeschuk,

1593
02:03:28,211 --> 02:03:29,131
[SPEAKER_05]: He replied, quote,

1594
02:03:57,728 --> 02:03:58,148
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1595
02:04:25,399 --> 02:04:26,760
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1596
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:50,272
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't understand why our culture gets so wrapped up in this.

1597
02:04:50,732 --> 02:04:53,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when, oh my god, there might be tits in a video game.

1598
02:04:53,835 --> 02:04:54,415
[SPEAKER_05]: So what?

1599
02:04:54,495 --> 02:04:56,817
[SPEAKER_05]: My god, do you know how violent games have gotten?

1600
02:04:57,097 --> 02:04:59,879
[SPEAKER_05]: We've heard every word possible in a game at this point.

1601
02:05:00,319 --> 02:05:01,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, fuck, shit, cock.

1602
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,641
[SPEAKER_05]: They've all been in a video game at some point.

1603
02:05:04,061 --> 02:05:07,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if they weren't in the game, many kids put them in anyway.

1604
02:05:07,344 --> 02:05:08,845
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the name of their characters.

1605
02:05:09,245 --> 02:05:13,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Who didn't have that Final Fantasy party where all your character names were cock, piss, tits, and ball?

1606
02:05:14,028 --> 02:05:14,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't.

1607
02:05:14,708 --> 02:05:15,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I named mine after my friends.

1608
02:05:15,969 --> 02:05:16,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1609
02:05:16,610 --> 02:05:17,810
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm getting at, though, right?

1610
02:05:19,271 --> 02:05:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just being difficult.

1611
02:05:21,032 --> 02:05:25,755
[SPEAKER_05]: If games are getting closer and closer to movies, if it fits the context of the game, why not?

1612
02:05:26,416 --> 02:05:28,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and it's not like we've never had it before.

1613
02:05:28,617 --> 02:05:31,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, God of War had it, and we've seen them in other games.

1614
02:05:31,619 --> 02:05:35,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy VII, the big deal with that was that Barret cussed.

1615
02:05:36,482 --> 02:05:38,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, what's the big deal?

1616
02:05:38,083 --> 02:05:41,686
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people who, you know, got a big butt up their butt.

1617
02:05:42,166 --> 02:05:42,266
Yeah.

1618
02:05:43,044 --> 02:05:44,525
[SPEAKER_05]: A butt up their butt?

1619
02:05:44,545 --> 02:05:49,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I said a bug up their butt I thought you said a big butt up their butt Isn't that a little redundant?

1620
02:05:50,267 --> 02:05:53,929
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have a big bug up their butt You've heard that phrase before

1621
02:05:54,614 --> 02:05:57,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee in chat says, because boobs are worse than decapitation.

1622
02:05:58,236 --> 02:06:00,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, in our culture, it seems that way, doesn't it?

1623
02:06:00,777 --> 02:06:04,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because the people are so freaking repressed.

1624
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:06,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

1625
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,961
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what I say about damn near everything.

1626
02:06:09,001 --> 02:06:13,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You stop making such a big fucking deal out of it, and guess what?

1627
02:06:13,624 --> 02:06:15,285
[SPEAKER_03]: It stops being a big fucking deal.

1628
02:06:17,566 --> 02:06:19,347
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, okay, for example...

1629
02:06:20,583 --> 02:06:22,423
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say, fuck now.

1630
02:06:23,284 --> 02:06:24,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

1631
02:06:24,764 --> 02:06:26,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I was always able to say fuck.

1632
02:06:26,824 --> 02:06:28,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me finish.

1633
02:06:28,665 --> 02:06:36,346
[SPEAKER_03]: 200 years ago, if you said, fuck, you could be put in stocks and displayed for being profane.

1634
02:06:36,566 --> 02:06:37,266
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?

1635
02:06:38,267 --> 02:06:39,167
[SPEAKER_03]: But you see what I mean?

1636
02:06:39,947 --> 02:06:41,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Our language has evolved.

1637
02:06:41,527 --> 02:06:44,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Our idea of morality has evolved.

1638
02:06:47,789 --> 02:06:49,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I could go on and on about that.

1639
02:06:50,350 --> 02:07:13,407
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's just they're gonna die Rob all of those people with the big moral you know stick up their butt so I don't say you know bug up their butt they have a big butt up their butt growing up their ass they're they're gonna die it's gonna they're gonna die okay me some people gonna die you know what I mean though

1640
02:07:15,823 --> 02:07:19,147
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to move on.

1641
02:07:21,049 --> 02:07:29,678
[SPEAKER_03]: What is morally acceptable today is going to be tame, tame, tame 30 years from now.

1642
02:07:29,959 --> 02:07:35,264
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always going to be repressed people out there.

1643
02:07:37,046 --> 02:07:42,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do we have a comment in chat from Leachum6 that says, I think DarkSakura should shove Loki's butt up Rob's butt.

1644
02:07:43,248 --> 02:07:44,768
[SPEAKER_05]: How mature are we, people?

1645
02:07:44,948 --> 02:07:45,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.

1646
02:07:46,949 --> 02:07:48,169
[SPEAKER_05]: How would that even work?

1647
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:51,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Why am I even trying to justify a comment like that?

1648
02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:52,530
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

1649
02:07:53,371 --> 02:07:54,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Only in our chat.

1650
02:07:54,131 --> 02:07:57,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Here's what I have to say.

1651
02:07:58,752 --> 02:07:59,753
[SPEAKER_03]: More boobies!

1652
02:08:00,913 --> 02:08:01,833
[SPEAKER_03]: More cock!

1653
02:08:02,913 --> 02:08:04,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And not the animated porn star, by the way.

1654
02:08:06,075 --> 02:08:07,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Moorcock.

1655
02:08:08,396 --> 02:08:10,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it at the Lighthouse bookstore.

1656
02:08:11,338 --> 02:08:13,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I was liking this more boobies tangent you were going down.

1657
02:08:13,659 --> 02:08:17,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Explain, how should gamers incorporate boobies into the games?

1658
02:08:18,241 --> 02:08:24,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they should get those boob balls from realdoll.com and just put them on top of their Xbox.

1659
02:08:25,965 --> 02:08:30,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they feel aggression at their game, they hit pause and go play with some boobies.

1660
02:08:32,682 --> 02:08:35,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I don't think you want to make the boob usage juvenile.

1661
02:08:35,824 --> 02:08:48,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, which unfortunately, that's the kind of crap that ruins it for everybody is that when boobies in video games becomes more acceptable, then you're going to see more of that stuff like, you know, Boob Slapper 5000 on the Wii or something like that.

1662
02:08:48,491 --> 02:08:49,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd buy that.

1663
02:08:49,312 --> 02:08:49,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Garbage.

1664
02:08:49,972 --> 02:08:51,473
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just absolute garbage.

1665
02:08:51,893 --> 02:08:54,855
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I think if boobs is done tastefully.

1666
02:08:54,875 --> 02:08:56,776
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be garbage on the Wii regardless.

1667
02:08:57,136 --> 02:08:59,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather see it all be adult garbage.

1668
02:08:59,338 --> 02:08:59,698
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1669
02:09:00,225 --> 02:09:05,909
[SPEAKER_06]: If there were more party game collections that were all adult party games, I think that we'd get a lot more purchases.

1670
02:09:05,929 --> 02:09:08,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the gaming industry is probably worried about the porn market.

1671
02:09:08,852 --> 02:09:10,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, think about it.

1672
02:09:11,213 --> 02:09:15,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Could that open up the floodgates to interactive porn on the Wii or the DS?

1673
02:09:16,517 --> 02:09:20,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like there's not interactive porn on the PC already, Rob.

1674
02:09:21,601 --> 02:09:24,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've got Red Light District and Second Life and...

1675
02:09:26,477 --> 02:09:30,078
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is a way to put porn on something... Yeah, but Second Life doesn't count because it's furries.

1676
02:09:30,918 --> 02:09:34,219
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is a way to put porn on something, porn will be on something.

1677
02:09:34,839 --> 02:09:37,000
[SPEAKER_03]: People are obsessed with the nookie.

1678
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,622
[SPEAKER_03]: They will... If they're not getting it in their real life, they will find some way of simulating it.

1679
02:09:44,542 --> 02:09:50,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... And this is what I don't get why people are so repressed over everything.

1680
02:09:50,724 --> 02:09:54,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that... Hi, humans, for the most part, are wired to fuck.

1681
02:09:56,488 --> 02:09:57,049
[SPEAKER_03]: End of story.

1682
02:09:58,510 --> 02:10:15,344
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, whether or not you want to procreate, whether or not you have an interest in whatever gender one has an interest in, or even what species one has an interest in, human beings, for the most part, are wired to fuck.

1683
02:10:17,326 --> 02:10:18,807
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a genetic imperative.

1684
02:10:18,948 --> 02:10:20,269
[SPEAKER_03]: That is built into the DNA.

1685
02:10:22,299 --> 02:10:29,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And while some people are not wired to fuck, and I, you know, fully mean people, fantastic.

1686
02:10:29,164 --> 02:10:31,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Asexual, right?

1687
02:10:31,746 --> 02:10:31,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1688
02:10:32,407 --> 02:10:33,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are wired that way.

1689
02:10:34,468 --> 02:10:35,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people are wired to fuck.

1690
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:50,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Including all of those repressed right-wing, you know, Republican assholes who want to, you know, or all of those, you know, religious right people, you know.

1691
02:10:52,296 --> 02:10:54,678
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of them have we heard of?

1692
02:10:55,538 --> 02:11:12,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, having affairs with Playboy Bunnies in the 80s, or senators getting blowjobs in the bathroom, or governors running off to Argentina to go get some Argentinian nookie.

1693
02:11:14,650 --> 02:11:29,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at some of the stuff in the chatroom at chat.orangeandreja.com Obviously a chat like this is getting a big response Joshi16 says DarkSakura for President 2012 More boobies, more cock Let's see, what else do we have here?

1694
02:11:30,302 --> 02:11:35,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee said Kevin Smith said that he was going to put more cock in his films because one of his movies got an NC-17 at first

1695
02:11:36,787 --> 02:11:37,728
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a little silly.

1696
02:11:38,348 --> 02:11:39,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and think about it.

1697
02:11:39,429 --> 02:11:44,372
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could put this type of stuff in our culture, you could show people how to do it the safe way.

1698
02:11:45,013 --> 02:11:51,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, imagine if people did this, but they would stop and put on a condom first.

1699
02:11:51,217 --> 02:11:55,380
[SPEAKER_05]: It might help put the image of safe sex out there, which is smart.

1700
02:11:55,400 --> 02:12:01,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It should all be handled like it was in The Naked Gun, where they had the full-body condom.

1701
02:12:02,005 --> 02:12:02,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1702
02:12:02,505 --> 02:12:04,327
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I mean, really...

1703
02:12:08,047 --> 02:12:22,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, it's, I think that it's just the whole, there's, I mean, okay, it's like the little kid who knows something is bad and he does it anyway because there's that risk involved.

1704
02:12:22,158 --> 02:12:23,899
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing something naughty, you know.

1705
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:30,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, wanting to go sneak out and buy, you know, and smoke pack cigarettes even though it's really disgusting.

1706
02:12:31,425 --> 02:12:33,147
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's that same type of...

1707
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:37,913
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's something dangerous.

1708
02:12:37,973 --> 02:12:40,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something, you know, not accepted.

1709
02:12:41,117 --> 02:12:44,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas you go to another country and it's like, so?

1710
02:12:45,181 --> 02:12:46,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, boobs.

1711
02:12:46,382 --> 02:12:47,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's bring it back to video games.

1712
02:12:47,784 --> 02:12:48,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1713
02:12:48,425 --> 02:12:49,045
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's all right.

1714
02:12:49,145 --> 02:12:51,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's bring it back to video games and try to close out the topic.

1715
02:12:51,428 --> 02:12:53,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just my point is that there should be more boobs in video games.

1716
02:12:53,763 --> 02:12:53,923
[SPEAKER_05]: F.U.S.

1717
02:12:54,063 --> 02:12:54,323
[SPEAKER_05]: of the Week

1718
02:13:29,758 --> 02:13:40,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have something to, of course, inspire the angst this week, and that would be this story about a child porn collector who blamed games for fueling his obsession.

1719
02:13:41,664 --> 02:13:55,552
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a London man who said, and I don't know why his name isn't out here, but the London Free Press didn't run it, apparently said he lived in a closed box of friendless fantasy, and it was fueled by video games, his computer, and comic books.

1720
02:13:56,172 --> 02:13:58,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd work, come home, lock myself in the apartment...

1721
02:14:00,258 --> 02:14:08,181
[SPEAKER_05]: After a difficult childhood in foster care where he was separated from his siblings, he became a truck driver who lived by himself in squalor and clinical depression.

1722
02:14:08,622 --> 02:14:11,983
[SPEAKER_05]: He was in a black hole, a strange sort of world his computer created.

1723
02:14:14,624 --> 02:14:18,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I think your issues go far beyond what your computer made you do.

1724
02:14:19,366 --> 02:14:22,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Your computers and video games don't control your actions.

1725
02:14:22,668 --> 02:14:24,268
[SPEAKER_05]: You, sir, control your actions.

1726
02:14:24,808 --> 02:14:28,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, Facepalm, if I've ever heard that.

1727
02:14:28,755 --> 02:14:31,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yes, how about some angst dedicated towards this guy this week?

1728
02:14:31,477 --> 02:14:32,718
[SPEAKER_05]: The FU's of the week, DarkSakura.

1729
02:14:33,738 --> 02:14:37,461
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the stitch that got popped and the other stitch that regressed into my hand.

1730
02:14:38,662 --> 02:14:41,984
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all coming out on Tuesday, but they hurt.

1731
02:14:43,185 --> 02:14:43,845
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurts a lot.

1732
02:14:44,906 --> 02:14:45,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck that.

1733
02:14:48,762 --> 02:14:53,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Big ol' fuck you to Kimberly Block and also Jason K. Singleton.

1734
02:14:54,283 --> 02:14:57,864
[SPEAKER_06]: You may not be familiar with them unless you live in the Sacramento area of California.

1735
02:14:59,204 --> 02:15:11,947
[SPEAKER_06]: They are two shysters, basically, that are using the American Disability Act to file lawsuits against numerous businesses causing them to basically settle with them to get money.

1736
02:15:12,441 --> 02:15:13,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard about this on the news.

1737
02:15:13,741 --> 02:15:23,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was the same people, but I heard about this like 80 businesses got sued or something and the people never even visited them.

1738
02:15:23,805 --> 02:15:26,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and basically this is happening again.

1739
02:15:26,226 --> 02:15:28,427
[SPEAKER_06]: This woman has filed four lawsuits.

1740
02:15:28,707 --> 02:15:30,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you may be asking yourself, why the hell do I care about this?

1741
02:15:31,087 --> 02:15:32,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it comes back to hamburgers.

1742
02:15:33,568 --> 02:15:41,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's because they are closing, they are forcing the squeeze in, which you may have seen them on the Food Network, a really small place at

1743
02:15:41,391 --> 02:15:42,312
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1744
02:16:05,072 --> 02:16:08,953
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, I think they should be able to serve the handicapped.

1745
02:16:08,993 --> 02:16:10,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but they do.

1746
02:16:10,213 --> 02:16:12,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Ring a bell, you know, or something.

1747
02:16:12,174 --> 02:16:13,254
[SPEAKER_06]: They do, and they're willing.

1748
02:16:13,554 --> 02:16:15,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And the problem is, though, she doesn't give a shit.

1749
02:16:15,494 --> 02:16:23,576
[SPEAKER_06]: She probably has never been here, and the businesses that she sued are, like, within... Like, there's two liquor stores, like, nine miles away from where she lives.

1750
02:16:23,656 --> 02:16:26,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, who the fuck would drive nine miles to a liquor store?

1751
02:16:26,816 --> 02:16:27,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is Sacramento.

1752
02:16:28,157 --> 02:16:29,897
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, like, a liquor store in every corner, so...

1753
02:16:30,680 --> 02:16:33,586
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's obviously just for the money is all it's about.

1754
02:16:33,667 --> 02:16:39,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And this guy in Eureka or whatever the attorney is doing, he has like 164 lawsuits out there, all ADA cases, so...

1755
02:16:42,779 --> 02:16:43,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to go!

1756
02:16:43,459 --> 02:16:47,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for closing a historic neighborhood, or a historic restaurant.

1757
02:16:47,942 --> 02:16:49,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay with these lawsuits.

1758
02:16:51,344 --> 02:16:52,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hold on, hold on.

1759
02:16:52,965 --> 02:16:53,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, I'm finished.

1760
02:16:54,146 --> 02:17:08,914
[SPEAKER_05]: If the business really is insensitive towards handicapped needs, you know, even if the person lives far away, if the business really truly is insensitive towards handicapped needs, but it sounds like these places, you know, they will make it work.

1761
02:17:08,934 --> 02:17:11,816
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, ring the bell, honk the horn, you know,

1762
02:17:12,436 --> 02:17:13,657
[SPEAKER_05]: They have no sugar on it.

1763
02:17:35,377 --> 02:17:37,878
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the point I'm trying to get at.

1764
02:17:38,699 --> 02:17:46,562
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing is the Disability Act in and of itself is severely flawed.

1765
02:17:46,982 --> 02:17:53,845
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people who qualify for the Disability Act who really are perfectly innate.

1766
02:17:53,905 --> 02:17:56,686
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for like Handicap Parking Placards or something.

1767
02:17:57,227 --> 02:18:01,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Who... Now... Like... Okay.

1768
02:18:01,749 --> 02:18:02,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to remember what it is.

1769
02:18:02,729 --> 02:18:03,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if you have...

1770
02:18:04,847 --> 02:18:06,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Problems balancing your checkbook.

1771
02:18:07,768 --> 02:18:09,930
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually qualify for a disabled parking.

1772
02:18:11,550 --> 02:18:11,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1773
02:18:12,351 --> 02:18:23,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really... The legislation on it is so flawed that almost anyone can squeeze in and qualify for some sort of thing under the Disabilities Act.

1774
02:18:23,897 --> 02:18:24,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be modernized.

1775
02:18:25,017 --> 02:18:27,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does need to be completely revamped.

1776
02:18:27,779 --> 02:18:29,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people personally who...

1777
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:32,943
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely should have the Placard.

1778
02:18:33,303 --> 02:18:33,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.

1779
02:18:34,244 --> 02:18:37,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely qualify for the benefits under these.

1780
02:18:37,408 --> 02:18:41,833
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people I know who should qualify and for some reason do not.

1781
02:18:42,453 --> 02:18:43,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's entirely unfair.

1782
02:18:43,955 --> 02:18:45,577
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but like

1783
02:18:47,327 --> 02:18:52,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there is... I put this in the same category... Oh god, I'm going to get political again.

1784
02:18:52,169 --> 02:18:53,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to put this as briefly as I can.

1785
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:56,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I put this in the same category as welfare.

1786
02:18:57,712 --> 02:18:59,232
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of room for abuse.

1787
02:18:59,973 --> 02:19:03,154
[SPEAKER_03]: And if people can get a free ride, they will get a free ride.

1788
02:19:04,155 --> 02:19:07,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there needs to be more enabling services.

1789
02:19:07,876 --> 02:19:11,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of, you know, pandering services.

1790
02:19:12,899 --> 02:19:13,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll leave it at that.

1791
02:19:13,959 --> 02:19:15,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's so stupid...

1792
02:19:17,586 --> 02:19:19,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all of this should be thrown out as frivolous.

1793
02:19:20,328 --> 02:19:22,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all of this should be thrown out as frivolous.

1794
02:19:22,470 --> 02:19:25,893
[SPEAKER_03]: She has a personal experience in those places.

1795
02:19:25,933 --> 02:19:27,354
[SPEAKER_05]: That where they refuse to help her.

1796
02:19:28,095 --> 02:19:28,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Or accommodate her.

1797
02:19:29,796 --> 02:19:32,899
[SPEAKER_03]: If the business wants your money, they will accommodate you.

1798
02:19:34,756 --> 02:19:35,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1799
02:19:56,556 --> 02:20:00,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's get back to some more gaming news.

1800
02:20:00,119 --> 02:20:05,663
[SPEAKER_05]: We just have about three more stories for you guys, and then it's going to be time for you guys to call in 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1801
02:20:05,964 --> 02:20:09,386
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you have a story for us about... I sure do.

1802
02:20:10,407 --> 02:20:12,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants vs. Zombies!

1803
02:20:12,509 --> 02:20:14,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out on other platforms.

1804
02:20:15,692 --> 02:20:26,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now it's only on PC and Mac, but PopCap is talking about working on an Xbox Live Arcade version, I do believe, and possibly on iPhone.

1805
02:20:27,119 --> 02:20:30,142
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a way they can work it into World of Warcraft, I'm sure they will too.

1806
02:20:30,682 --> 02:20:30,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1807
02:20:32,844 --> 02:20:34,526
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so crazy with their PopCap games.

1808
02:20:34,566 --> 02:20:38,049
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, did you hear this week about the World of Warcraft Pagle game?

1809
02:20:38,449 --> 02:20:48,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just now the mod within World of Warcraft, because it's very clear there is some PopCap employees that are addicted to World of Warcraft, because you've noticed these little, like...

1810
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:51,121
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

1811
02:21:19,283 --> 02:21:20,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's furious dry humping.

1812
02:21:20,924 --> 02:21:21,464
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

1813
02:21:21,624 --> 02:21:23,206
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all free, so we all win.

1814
02:21:23,466 --> 02:21:25,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not going to complain.

1815
02:21:25,768 --> 02:21:26,929
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all free expansions.

1816
02:21:27,329 --> 02:21:28,970
[SPEAKER_05]: It's brand awareness.

1817
02:21:29,651 --> 02:21:32,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets all the stories covered on blogs and all that, so good for them.

1818
02:21:33,834 --> 02:21:34,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Dry humping?

1819
02:21:34,495 --> 02:21:36,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these type of partnerships I'd like to see happen more often.

1820
02:21:37,137 --> 02:21:40,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see more mutual masturbation going on in the gaming world.

1821
02:21:40,239 --> 02:21:41,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you guys.

1822
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:42,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Furious humping.

1823
02:21:42,781 --> 02:21:43,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1824
02:21:44,537 --> 02:21:51,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a game that I don't think will have furious humping in it, Scribblenauts has been rated by the ESRB.

1825
02:21:51,802 --> 02:21:55,986
[SPEAKER_06]: And as creative as the game is, their description of it is just as creative.

1826
02:21:57,106 --> 02:22:01,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they are talking, you know, now the ESRB is required to have...

1827
02:22:03,511 --> 02:22:05,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Little synopsis of the games.

1828
02:22:05,893 --> 02:22:07,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically here's what they put.

1829
02:22:08,175 --> 02:22:09,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Scribblenauts, which is rated E10+.

1830
02:22:09,916 --> 02:22:18,282
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a puzzle game in which players navigate a series of traps, puzzles, and enemies to collect stars scattered throughout the colorful levels.

1831
02:22:18,942 --> 02:22:23,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Players have the ability to summon different objects by writing slash typing in the words.

1832
02:22:23,906 --> 02:22:25,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Example, bike, spaceship, lion.

1833
02:22:26,308 --> 02:22:27,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And watch it come to life.

1834
02:22:27,308 --> 02:22:29,310
[SPEAKER_06]: If multiple words are entered in a sequence...

1835
02:22:30,010 --> 02:22:32,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Different whimsical scenarios can be triggered.

1836
02:22:32,872 --> 02:22:34,753
[SPEAKER_06]: A bicycle can be used to jump over a baby.

1837
02:22:35,113 --> 02:22:36,894
[SPEAKER_06]: A bulldozer can clear away a shark.

1838
02:22:37,414 --> 02:22:39,495
[SPEAKER_06]: A cabbage can be fed to a dinosaur.

1839
02:22:40,115 --> 02:22:44,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Players can elect to summon cartoony versions of bats, bombs, guns, and flamethrowers.

1840
02:22:44,898 --> 02:22:48,519
[SPEAKER_06]: These types of items can be used to destroy objects or even other summoned items.

1841
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:52,121
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, a club can be used to hit an animal.

1842
02:22:52,501 --> 02:22:55,263
[SPEAKER_06]: A stake can be attached to a baby to attract lions.

1843
02:22:55,943 --> 02:22:57,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Rockets can be lobbed at a man.

1844
02:22:57,844 --> 02:22:59,345
[SPEAKER_05]: That in itself is so amazing.

1845
02:22:59,385 --> 02:23:02,306
[SPEAKER_05]: You can attach a steak to a baby to attract animals.

1846
02:23:03,226 --> 02:23:03,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

1847
02:23:04,286 --> 02:23:04,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

1848
02:23:05,127 --> 02:23:13,310
[SPEAKER_06]: These triggered animations are minimally depicted and usually accompanied by a popping musical sound effect, bright star-shaped flashes, or small puffs of smoke.

1849
02:23:13,370 --> 02:23:18,612
[SPEAKER_06]: If a player wishes to, they may type the word and vomit, which causes a beige-colored lump to appear on the screen.

1850
02:23:20,133 --> 02:23:23,374
[SPEAKER_06]: God, if this is not the game of the year, I don't know what is.

1851
02:23:25,191 --> 02:23:25,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and...

1852
02:23:51,149 --> 02:24:02,097
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, recognizing that this is going to be a success, they would like to see Scribblenauts come to other platforms.

1853
02:24:02,398 --> 02:24:05,360
[SPEAKER_06]: We've never limited ourselves to the DS as a platform.

1854
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:08,662
[SPEAKER_06]: In our heads, we'll see what the future holds.

1855
02:24:08,722 --> 02:24:16,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, we think that would be a hit on any platform, whether that platform would be an Xbox 360, PS3, or who knows.

1856
02:24:18,148 --> 02:24:21,231
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's coming from Marius Falbush I thought bad things

1857
02:24:27,219 --> 02:24:28,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I bet you did after the boobie story.

1858
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:39,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, though, this game is going to inspire folks to trade whimsical answers to scenarios on the internet, like the most wacky fucking ways to beat levels that you've ever heard of.

1859
02:24:39,323 --> 02:24:40,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that could be interesting.

1860
02:24:40,604 --> 02:24:43,084
[SPEAKER_06]: It also has level swapping and custom levels.

1861
02:24:43,185 --> 02:24:43,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't know that.

1862
02:24:43,785 --> 02:24:44,405
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

1863
02:24:44,665 --> 02:24:44,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1864
02:24:45,885 --> 02:24:46,586
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

1865
02:24:46,986 --> 02:24:50,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if there's going to be one foolproof way to beat every level, though.

1866
02:24:50,827 --> 02:24:52,750
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be different ways to beat levels.

1867
02:24:54,171 --> 02:24:55,152
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like golf.

1868
02:24:55,392 --> 02:25:03,982
[SPEAKER_06]: You have pars in the game where you're trying to beat the level with X number of objects spawned, that type of thing.

1869
02:25:04,562 --> 02:25:10,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember even in the free mode that we were messing around with, there was a meter as to how many objects you could have at one time.

1870
02:25:10,829 --> 02:25:12,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see them doing things with that meter.

1871
02:25:14,372 --> 02:25:18,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Joshi16 in our chatroom, chat.orangeonsradio.com says, I want it on the PC Mac.

1872
02:25:19,057 --> 02:25:21,840
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkTetsuya says, yeah, I look forward to the GameFAQs entries on it.

1873
02:25:23,702 --> 02:25:27,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if you can summon dirty words or if the game just scolds you for trying to put them in.

1874
02:25:27,686 --> 02:25:28,526
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it just won't recognize them.

1875
02:25:29,027 --> 02:25:30,408
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you put in like feces?

1876
02:25:31,589 --> 02:25:32,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it not even recognize that?

1877
02:25:33,593 --> 02:25:34,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know.

1878
02:25:34,834 --> 02:25:35,515
[SPEAKER_06]: It may do poop.

1879
02:25:35,735 --> 02:25:36,435
[SPEAKER_11]: You could do vomit.

1880
02:25:36,475 --> 02:25:37,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't you do poo?

1881
02:25:38,117 --> 02:25:38,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1882
02:25:38,397 --> 02:25:38,677
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1883
02:25:38,697 --> 02:25:39,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Poop would be in there.

1884
02:25:39,558 --> 02:25:40,359
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have poop rocket.

1885
02:25:40,379 --> 02:25:42,020
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have tried poop rocket.

1886
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:44,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's in the dictionary.

1887
02:25:44,302 --> 02:25:45,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like poop flinging monkey.

1888
02:25:48,125 --> 02:25:48,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll see.

1889
02:25:48,665 --> 02:25:51,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what have you... Yeah, tiger claw brings up a good point.

1890
02:25:51,327 --> 02:25:52,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Penis is not even a dirty word.

1891
02:25:52,708 --> 02:25:53,689
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a scientific word.

1892
02:25:54,269 --> 02:25:54,990
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still not in the game.

1893
02:25:55,390 --> 02:25:56,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tetsuya says, so no cocks?

1894
02:25:57,312 --> 02:25:59,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you should be able to put in cock and a little rooster shows up.

1895
02:26:00,882 --> 02:26:03,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Put in fag and a cigarette shows up.

1896
02:26:03,193 --> 02:26:03,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1897
02:26:05,643 --> 02:26:06,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Just do the literal meaning.

1898
02:26:35,014 --> 02:26:35,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow.

1899
02:26:36,735 --> 02:26:43,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember, we talked a while, I'm sure at length about this on the show before, about the whole Wii's new demo play feature?

1900
02:26:43,499 --> 02:26:47,221
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where you'd be able to pause the game and just skip scenes like it was a DVD.

1901
02:26:47,941 --> 02:26:50,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Or get walked through certain scenarios in the game.

1902
02:26:51,063 --> 02:26:51,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

1903
02:26:53,052 --> 02:27:03,336
[SPEAKER_05]: This week it was announced that through a blurb in Nikkei newspaper in Japan, the feature will be used in portable games as well.

1904
02:27:03,576 --> 02:27:05,017
[SPEAKER_05]: That means it's coming to the DS.

1905
02:27:06,417 --> 02:27:09,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, the newspaper referred to it as skip functionality, a skip feature, if you will.

1906
02:27:10,679 --> 02:27:14,221
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also supposed to be used for high-speed action games.

1907
02:27:15,001 --> 02:27:15,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1908
02:27:16,522 --> 02:27:16,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1909
02:27:17,842 --> 02:27:23,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what this could bring for DS games in the future, but this does seem to be the future of Nintendo.

1910
02:27:23,044 --> 02:27:24,045
[SPEAKER_05]: The future of gaming?

1911
02:27:24,705 --> 02:27:28,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess that's all in how the general public responds to it.

1912
02:27:28,527 --> 02:27:28,927
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1913
02:27:30,598 --> 02:27:31,639
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that for demo play.

1914
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:38,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1915
02:27:38,281 --> 02:27:43,183
[SPEAKER_05]: But do keep in mind, if you are going to use Skype to call us, please make sure you test your connection first to ECHO123.

1916
02:27:43,263 --> 02:27:48,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1917
02:27:48,905 --> 02:27:51,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have some last minute stories we want to get into while we wait for some calls?

1918
02:27:51,345 --> 02:27:54,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's a little bit of a delay between us and when they hear us on Orange Lounge Radio.

1919
02:27:54,847 --> 02:27:55,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, never mind.

1920
02:27:55,307 --> 02:27:56,007
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting a call right now.

1921
02:27:56,347 --> 02:27:56,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I lied.

1922
02:27:57,187 --> 02:27:58,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1923
02:27:58,348 --> 02:27:58,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1924
02:28:00,148 --> 02:28:06,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, BlazBlue is a fighting game that's supposed to be the spiritual successor to Guilty Gear.

1925
02:28:06,951 --> 02:28:06,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1926
02:28:27,682 --> 02:28:33,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the total is 12 characters that you get to play as, so you've got a smaller roster list.

1927
02:28:34,123 --> 02:28:36,664
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're pretty balanced, actually.

1928
02:28:37,404 --> 02:28:43,025
[SPEAKER_07]: And the game is, well, I think of it as an easier Guilty Gear, actually.

1929
02:28:44,585 --> 02:28:47,366
[SPEAKER_07]: The button layout is just four buttons.

1930
02:28:49,926 --> 02:28:55,147
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got light, make them strong, and then a button you use to do cool shit.

1931
02:28:58,311 --> 02:28:59,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a big fighting game fan?

1932
02:28:59,672 --> 02:29:01,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you play a lot of the fighters that come out?

1933
02:29:03,515 --> 02:29:03,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1934
02:29:04,095 --> 02:29:10,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually looking forward to Maul vs. Calcom 2 coming out at the end of the month, and King of Fighters 12.

1935
02:29:10,941 --> 02:29:20,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I just wanted to kind of gauge your, like, experience and love for fighting game before I ask this next question, and that would be, how does BlazBlue, in your opinion, stack up to other fighting games?

1936
02:29:22,229 --> 02:29:26,913
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a slower Guilty Gear, I guess, but...

1937
02:29:28,122 --> 02:29:48,242
[SPEAKER_07]: my opinion is it's faster than Street Fighter 4 it's a really cool it's just a really cool fighting game

1938
02:29:48,544 --> 02:29:49,044
[SPEAKER_05]: King of Fighters 12

1939
02:30:11,452 --> 02:30:15,393
[SPEAKER_05]: and all these games, especially the Neo Geo ones, are coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

1940
02:30:16,134 --> 02:30:25,017
[SPEAKER_05]: When you can get these games for $10, $15 a pop, does that make $60 or $50, whatever BlazBlue costs, worth it in comparison?

1941
02:30:26,898 --> 02:30:37,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when you look at the online of those games, I have Garo, Mark of the Wolves, but from the times I played, online was total trash, actually.

1942
02:30:39,102 --> 02:30:39,302
[SPEAKER_07]: But

1943
02:30:40,032 --> 02:31:06,248
[SPEAKER_07]: and BlazBlue, it's, you know, you're getting a high-definition fighter with a complete story mode and the story mode, some of the characters are, like, really interesting and, you know, you follow their path and even, like, characters, like, you know, they had me saying, wow, a fighting game can have this good a story

1944
02:31:06,755 --> 02:31:11,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Like sometimes I was actually laughing my ass off at some characters' wackiness.

1945
02:31:11,398 --> 02:31:22,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes, you know, I was feeling bad for a character because, you know, I personally think that they're pathetic and, you know, but, you know, they just keep fighting.

1946
02:31:23,587 --> 02:31:25,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a PS3 and I just wanted to say it's awesome so far and I

1947
02:31:53,516 --> 02:31:59,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Best Buy, I don't know if they're doing this for all of them, but they have Valkyria Chronicles on clearance for only $15.

1948
02:31:59,984 --> 02:32:04,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great pickup and, you know, very cheap.

1949
02:32:04,529 --> 02:32:05,691
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Best Buy over here in San Antonio.

1950
02:32:12,229 --> 02:32:14,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have to try and find that here locally.

1951
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:15,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1952
02:32:16,510 --> 02:32:18,210
[SPEAKER_05]: One other quick question for you.

1953
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:20,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always kind of curious.

1954
02:32:20,791 --> 02:32:24,231
[SPEAKER_05]: When people plunk down $300, $400 for a new console, I always want to ask this.

1955
02:32:24,791 --> 02:32:25,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Why now?

1956
02:32:25,491 --> 02:32:27,152
[SPEAKER_05]: What made you decide to take the plunge now?

1957
02:32:28,592 --> 02:32:29,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Two things.

1958
02:32:30,052 --> 02:32:35,933
[SPEAKER_07]: One, they had this bundle going on with the Killzone 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4.

1959
02:32:36,453 --> 02:32:40,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to pick that up because I think for $400, that kind of justifies it.

1960
02:32:41,155 --> 02:32:43,636
[SPEAKER_07]: because in the next month we're supposed to be getting a price cut.

1961
02:32:44,677 --> 02:32:49,179
[SPEAKER_07]: So those two extra games, I don't know, they kind of seem to me to even it out.

1962
02:32:49,799 --> 02:32:57,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And plus, next month in August, there's supposed to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Blu-ray box set that I really want to pick up.

1963
02:32:58,143 --> 02:32:58,504
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1964
02:32:58,964 --> 02:32:59,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1965
02:32:59,384 --> 02:33:02,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you very much for your thoughts and opinions tonight and have fun with your PlayStation 3, all right?

1966
02:33:03,986 --> 02:33:04,186
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1967
02:33:04,206 --> 02:33:04,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1968
02:33:04,927 --> 02:33:05,347
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

1969
02:33:05,387 --> 02:33:06,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And LittleBigPlanet.

1970
02:33:06,347 --> 02:33:06,788
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

1971
02:33:07,048 --> 02:33:07,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1972
02:33:08,666 --> 02:33:10,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1973
02:33:11,068 --> 02:33:12,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It's GS68 Hi, GS68, what's on your mind?

1974
02:33:27,887 --> 02:33:33,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get back from California Extreme, which I'm guessing DarkSakura wasn't able to go to this year.

1975
02:33:33,311 --> 02:33:40,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, DarkSakura had the issues with her hand, so if she went, she wouldn't really be able to play the video games because of her hand.

1976
02:33:40,196 --> 02:33:40,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1977
02:33:40,957 --> 02:33:41,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Bummer, right?

1978
02:33:41,597 --> 02:33:46,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was going to go, but I had a conflict with the Rocky Reno show I'm doing.

1979
02:33:46,321 --> 02:33:49,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a rehearsal this weekend, and it sucked because I was in the bay.

1980
02:33:49,783 --> 02:33:51,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't that far away.

1981
02:33:51,505 --> 02:33:55,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have only taken me like 30 minutes to get there, but by the time we were done, California Extreme would have been done.

1982
02:33:56,108 --> 02:33:57,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just didn't...

1983
02:33:57,828 --> 02:33:58,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, when?

1984
02:33:58,948 --> 02:33:59,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, did it really?

1985
02:34:00,149 --> 02:34:01,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up, I thought it was done at like 9 o'clock.

1986
02:34:02,730 --> 02:34:03,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, oh well, it doesn't matter.

1987
02:34:04,230 --> 02:34:10,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't have gotten my money's worth, but I know we keep saying we're going to go every year and then some damn thing happens.

1988
02:34:10,512 --> 02:34:11,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the worst time of year.

1989
02:34:11,793 --> 02:34:13,373
[SPEAKER_05]: The summer is so, so busy.

1990
02:34:13,754 --> 02:34:14,514
[SPEAKER_05]: But you went.

1991
02:34:14,594 --> 02:34:15,874
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you enjoy yourself?

1992
02:34:17,475 --> 02:34:19,375
[SPEAKER_09]: It was alright.

1993
02:34:20,476 --> 02:34:24,457
[SPEAKER_09]: It felt like a little less games this year, I'm not sure.

1994
02:34:25,077 --> 02:34:26,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's only my second year going.

1995
02:34:29,035 --> 02:34:30,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what kind of games did you get a chance to play?

1996
02:34:30,916 --> 02:34:38,900
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, for those that have never been to California Extreme before, it's basically just a bunch of old school arcade games in a convention center.

1997
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:40,621
[SPEAKER_05]: You pay some money to get in.

1998
02:34:40,941 --> 02:34:41,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun.

1999
02:34:41,642 --> 02:34:43,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That's basically what it is.

2000
02:34:43,202 --> 02:34:44,643
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a traveling arcade.

2001
02:34:44,703 --> 02:34:49,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at older games with a few 90s, 2000s games thrown in.

2002
02:34:50,826 --> 02:34:57,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't feel high school wasn't finicky, but I couldn't get on the top 10, so...

2003
02:34:58,171 --> 02:34:58,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck that.

2004
02:34:58,651 --> 02:34:59,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw it.

2005
02:34:59,972 --> 02:35:03,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably got a chance to play it, because when I was a kid, I'd see it in tilt all the time, but it never really interested me.

2006
02:35:03,973 --> 02:35:04,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2007
02:35:27,478 --> 02:35:27,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2008
02:35:28,658 --> 02:35:30,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, it looks like you guys had a lot of fun.

2009
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:38,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I got around to playing Cosmo Gang, and if you play Point Blank to an advanced, this is like the final stage of advanced mode.

2010
02:35:38,822 --> 02:35:40,263
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the final stage of insane mode.

2011
02:35:41,763 --> 02:35:44,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Where there are a lot of... I'm sorry, go ahead.

2012
02:35:46,445 --> 02:35:53,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Where, like, you have these cartoon aliens coming down trying to steal your energy cubes, and you have to shoot them to keep them away.

2013
02:35:54,308 --> 02:35:56,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, if they take an energy cube, you lose.

2014
02:35:57,287 --> 02:36:00,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I worked at a Namco arcade for a long time.

2015
02:36:00,388 --> 02:36:06,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that game.

2016
02:36:06,350 --> 02:36:14,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I saw Pachinko Machine, which was really cool, but I never got to play because by the time I thought about playing it, it was gone.

2017
02:36:14,814 --> 02:36:16,034
[SPEAKER_09]: They are already packing it up.

2018
02:36:16,054 --> 02:36:17,875
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of surreal seeing it, especially considering...

2019
02:36:26,983 --> 02:36:28,544
[SPEAKER_09]: The man died a few weeks ago.

2020
02:36:28,844 --> 02:36:30,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, the machines were made.

2021
02:36:30,705 --> 02:36:31,265
[SPEAKER_05]: They're out there.

2022
02:36:31,345 --> 02:36:32,546
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I get what you're saying.

2023
02:36:32,626 --> 02:36:37,308
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of interesting to see that out in the wild right now with all the stuff in the media.

2024
02:36:37,648 --> 02:36:41,610
[SPEAKER_05]: But, well, what would you say was your favorite thing that you played at the show out of everything?

2025
02:36:43,030 --> 02:36:46,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Once I heard of Tyler's play Rush 2049 because it had an eight-player setup.

2026
02:36:47,733 --> 02:36:48,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, nice.

2027
02:36:49,073 --> 02:36:51,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting to play it the way it's intended with all eight people.

2028
02:36:51,894 --> 02:36:52,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2029
02:36:54,616 --> 02:36:54,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2030
02:36:55,703 --> 02:36:59,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there any garbage that you played where you were like, man, they should have just left this at home?

2031
02:37:02,464 --> 02:37:08,346
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a number of games that I played and didn't really recall enjoying for too long.

2032
02:37:08,606 --> 02:37:11,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

2033
02:37:13,747 --> 02:37:17,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It came across a pretty interesting game called Chillers.

2034
02:37:17,307 --> 02:37:25,329
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a game with one of those mountain gun things, and you have to shoot monsters to go on from one stage to the next, but

2035
02:37:25,984 --> 02:37:34,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes the things you shoot are corpses, like naked corpses in portrait chambers and such.

2036
02:37:34,366 --> 02:37:36,127
[SPEAKER_09]: That was very weird.

2037
02:37:36,467 --> 02:37:38,787
[SPEAKER_05]: That does sound very weird, but okay.

2038
02:37:38,907 --> 02:37:39,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever makes you happy, I guess.

2039
02:37:40,388 --> 02:37:44,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it sounds like you had a good time at the show, and I swear we're really going to try and make it next year.

2040
02:37:44,509 --> 02:37:46,549
[SPEAKER_05]: It just depends on the personal schedules and everything.

2041
02:37:46,589 --> 02:37:48,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully no surgeries or nothing like that.

2042
02:37:48,690 --> 02:37:51,370
[SPEAKER_05]: But any other comments about the show or for our listeners tonight?

2043
02:37:53,551 --> 02:37:53,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

2044
02:37:55,635 --> 02:37:56,376
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not really.

2045
02:37:56,396 --> 02:37:58,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to get a bonus involving my pictures.

2046
02:38:01,400 --> 02:38:04,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well... I've been posting them lately.

2047
02:38:04,382 --> 02:38:06,144
[SPEAKER_05]: The picture you just posted here in chat?

2048
02:38:06,184 --> 02:38:08,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, I'm going to take a look here.

2049
02:38:08,265 --> 02:38:09,707
[SPEAKER_09]: The pictures I've been posting.

2050
02:38:09,927 --> 02:38:10,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's one of them.

2051
02:38:12,609 --> 02:38:12,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

2052
02:38:12,969 --> 02:38:14,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then check out the gallery.

2053
02:38:14,270 --> 02:38:18,614
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like you've got a little gallery going on Photobucket and plugging it in our chatroom.

2054
02:38:19,154 --> 02:38:19,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2055
02:38:20,055 --> 02:38:23,318
[SPEAKER_05]: ROGS68, glad to hear you had fun and we'll hopefully see you next year.

2056
02:38:24,986 --> 02:38:26,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, see ya

2057
02:38:49,022 --> 02:39:07,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking over what's been happening so far and then all of a sudden I see this little gem of a story right here regarding Battlefield 1943 where apparently it says something about at least 5 million dying in the first day of multiplayer.

2058
02:39:10,277 --> 02:39:14,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go as far as saying that they're trying to get up to 48 million kills.

2059
02:39:17,577 --> 02:39:20,944
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, I hear Kotaku basically making a fit about it.

2060
02:39:21,585 --> 02:39:22,788
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that it's tasteless.

2061
02:39:23,088 --> 02:39:28,700
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that, you know, playing a World War II game and trying to rack up kills to match the amount in real life.

2062
02:39:31,725 --> 02:39:47,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, I mean, comparing it to the real life is a little bit tacky, especially when, you know, video games are supposed to be separated from real life, and a lot of times the justification for these games to be so violent is, well, it's not real life.

2063
02:39:48,175 --> 02:39:48,736
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

2064
02:39:49,576 --> 02:39:58,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people just, I mean, I can understand people's rationale regarding, you know, having, regarding something being tasteless, but it's just a game.

2065
02:39:59,892 --> 02:40:01,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what happened already happened.

2066
02:40:02,533 --> 02:40:07,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I mean, I'm okay with the game, but the little promotion is a little tacky.

2067
02:40:09,016 --> 02:40:09,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

2068
02:40:10,697 --> 02:40:27,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides that, basically staying on the subject of tastelessness, another one where, you know, they're playing a, they have like a flash game, I believe, that recreates Flight 1549, the one that landed on the Hudson earlier this year.

2069
02:40:27,305 --> 02:40:27,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.

2070
02:40:28,137 --> 02:40:36,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're basically saying, I don't know, it's just on the same subject of being tasteless, though.

2071
02:40:38,679 --> 02:40:38,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Well...

2072
02:40:40,655 --> 02:40:48,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess, but at the same time, you know, isn't there someone in the world who's created an art piece out of that?

2073
02:40:48,757 --> 02:40:51,617
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and maybe this is what goes for World War II as well.

2074
02:40:51,997 --> 02:40:56,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember Super Combine Massacre RPG getting, like, a lot of flack.

2075
02:40:57,398 --> 02:41:06,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, you know, the whole slam dance thing, which pretty much blew up in their face with the fact that they supposedly got censored for that game.

2076
02:41:08,362 --> 02:41:19,092
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see how tastelessness basically goes to the extreme in that sense, where you get censored in a festival that goes against the principles.

2077
02:41:19,972 --> 02:41:24,597
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I guess a lot of it just has to kind of do with your interpretation of it.

2078
02:41:24,797 --> 02:41:28,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes with games, that goes with art in general.

2079
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:31,803
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you want to be offended by it, you will.

2080
02:41:32,203 --> 02:41:34,646
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you won't allow yourself to be offended by it, you won't.

2081
02:41:35,976 --> 02:41:41,838
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that makes sense as usual in the world not everybody can be pleased apparently

2082
02:41:42,916 --> 02:41:43,496
[SPEAKER_05]: No, sir.

2083
02:41:43,996 --> 02:41:45,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anything else on your mind this week, Zaku?

2084
02:41:47,197 --> 02:42:03,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides DDRX still sucking and just waiting to hopefully, you know, if my local arcade, Chinatown Fair, apparently follows through on what they said they were by replacing every machine with DDRX, then I'll probably see how bad it is.

2085
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:06,321
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been pretty much dull on that end.

2086
02:42:06,889 --> 02:42:07,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, please?

2087
02:42:07,309 --> 02:42:09,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you gotta love those blanket answers trying to cover their own ass.

2088
02:42:26,980 --> 02:42:28,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, Zaku.

2089
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:29,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for being on the show.

2090
02:42:30,061 --> 02:42:31,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

2091
02:42:31,581 --> 02:42:32,421
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME.

2092
02:42:32,621 --> 02:42:34,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think he knows that was a reference to his story earlier tonight?

2093
02:42:35,201 --> 02:42:37,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think he knows what's going on.

2094
02:42:37,122 --> 02:42:38,102
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2095
02:42:39,022 --> 02:42:42,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2096
02:42:43,743 --> 02:42:47,183
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take like one more call and then we're going to wrap up for the night.

2097
02:42:47,704 --> 02:42:49,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2098
02:42:49,624 --> 02:42:51,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2099
02:42:51,384 --> 02:42:51,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Here comes a call.

2100
02:42:51,984 --> 02:42:52,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2101
02:42:52,944 --> 02:42:53,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2102
02:42:54,645 --> 02:42:56,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Benjamin Anderson.

2103
02:42:56,448 --> 02:42:57,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi Spazinator, what's on your mind tonight?

2104
02:42:59,609 --> 02:43:00,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Two things.

2105
02:43:01,930 --> 02:43:05,771
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, I just want to agree with what you were saying earlier.

2106
02:43:05,791 --> 02:43:13,293
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like a lot of people out there, especially in America, have things half-assed backwards.

2107
02:43:14,873 --> 02:43:24,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it be movies or games or whatever, you see people losing limbs, being decapitated, brutally murdered.

2108
02:43:25,202 --> 02:43:27,270
[SPEAKER_08]: But God forbid they show a boob.

2109
02:43:27,592 --> 02:43:30,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, this should go to DEFCON 3.

2110
02:43:30,825 --> 02:43:31,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

2111
02:43:32,504 --> 02:43:35,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to be fair, there's a lot of people that don't like the violence either.

2112
02:43:35,667 --> 02:43:37,730
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it does seem strange in our culture.

2113
02:43:37,930 --> 02:43:52,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of blame the MPAA at the end of the day because they're the ones that put the more stringent NC-17 ratings on things that are slightly sexual, whereas you can have all these violent movies rated R. I think it needs to go one way or the other.

2114
02:43:52,405 --> 02:43:55,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Either we need to get some more fucking tits in an R-rated movie or...

2115
02:43:56,388 --> 02:43:59,931
[SPEAKER_05]: and that was fuck and tits, not some fucking tits, although you can get those too.

2116
02:44:00,371 --> 02:44:07,035
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need that in an R-rated movie, or we need these extremely violent movies to be rated NC-17.

2117
02:44:07,295 --> 02:44:08,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them the kiss of death rating as well.

2118
02:44:09,317 --> 02:44:10,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you need to go one way or the other.

2119
02:44:11,458 --> 02:44:12,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting ridiculous.

2120
02:44:14,140 --> 02:44:24,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, the thing is, not to get all political and whatnot, plus I don't totally remember my history lessons, but I think...

2121
02:44:25,891 --> 02:44:41,534
[SPEAKER_08]: At least in part, the country was founded by ultra-conservative Puritans, like the Pilgrims, wearing the buckles on their shoes and whatnot.

2122
02:44:41,894 --> 02:44:42,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Burn the witch!

2123
02:44:42,454 --> 02:44:43,175
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a witch!

2124
02:44:43,595 --> 02:44:44,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Burn the witch!

2125
02:44:45,915 --> 02:44:46,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

2126
02:44:47,735 --> 02:44:48,476
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they were...

2127
02:44:51,395 --> 02:44:58,264
[SPEAKER_08]: If I remember my history, they even made plays illegal because they considered it a form of lying.

2128
02:44:58,465 --> 02:45:03,972
[SPEAKER_08]: They considered anything involving the body dirty and wrong and all that.

2129
02:45:04,528 --> 02:45:07,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we really haven't gone beyond that

2130
02:45:28,055 --> 02:45:47,043
[SPEAKER_05]: and like I can sit here on the internet and say fuck, shit, cock, piss, boobs I can say all of that you know and that's a great thing about freedom of speech which sadly not everyone in this world has but the thing is that we have these governing bodies that put labels on things that are broken and need to be modernized

2131
02:45:47,543 --> 02:45:56,246
[SPEAKER_05]: And the greatest, I mean, the biggest opinion I always use, or I should say example I always use, is a movie that came out in 1997, 1998.

2132
02:45:57,187 --> 02:45:58,307
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorite movies ever.

2133
02:45:58,327 --> 02:46:00,188
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Romeo and Michelle's High School Reunion.

2134
02:46:00,688 --> 02:46:05,750
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an innocent movie with Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino about these chicks that go to their 10-year high school reunion.

2135
02:46:06,110 --> 02:46:09,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a couple sex jokes and they say the word fuck a few times.

2136
02:46:09,792 --> 02:46:12,193
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie is rated R. And why?

2137
02:46:12,853 --> 02:46:14,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is a movie like that rated R?

2138
02:46:14,534 --> 02:46:16,355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's practically cartoony in nature.

2139
02:46:16,795 --> 02:46:19,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I would let a 13, 14-year-old watch this movie, no problem.

2140
02:46:20,357 --> 02:46:29,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Any kid that's old enough to know about sex, I would much rather have them watching this movie on repeat every day for a summer than watching The Terminator.

2141
02:46:29,422 --> 02:46:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I really would.

2142
02:46:33,644 --> 02:46:37,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these things we have in our culture really need to be modernized.

2143
02:46:37,686 --> 02:46:38,026
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

2144
02:46:39,881 --> 02:47:09,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree with you, but also at the same time, I think even you mentioned this time and time before, you know, video games have really been around for, what, 35, 40 years, whereas, like, movies have been around since, what, early, you know, 1900s, you know, there's, you know, people, you know, even, like, grandparents of the age have been going out watching movies, whereas, you know, well,

2145
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:14,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Video games have always been, what, our generation and the younger kids.

2146
02:47:15,163 --> 02:47:26,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's that kind of disconnect where the older generation think of video games as these kind of toys, toys of the kids.

2147
02:47:26,729 --> 02:47:29,851
[SPEAKER_08]: If something is cursing or violence or swearing it,

2148
02:47:30,376 --> 02:47:31,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, no.

2149
02:47:31,878 --> 02:47:34,480
[SPEAKER_08]: This could be the worst thing ever.

2150
02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:36,141
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a downfall of Western civilization.

2151
02:47:36,161 --> 02:47:37,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't even quote me on that.

2152
02:47:37,142 --> 02:47:38,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Earlier than that.

2153
02:47:56,740 --> 02:48:01,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't plan to profess to be a cinema expert, but it was very taboo.

2154
02:48:01,362 --> 02:48:03,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if the boobies showed up, it was extremely taboo.

2155
02:48:04,162 --> 02:48:07,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like seeing a blowjob in a movie is this day and age.

2156
02:48:08,624 --> 02:48:10,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games, I think, just have a way to go.

2157
02:48:10,344 --> 02:48:11,805
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need to wrap up.

2158
02:48:11,845 --> 02:48:13,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator, did you have anything else you wanted to share with us?

2159
02:48:15,346 --> 02:48:17,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I just want to add one more point.

2160
02:48:17,827 --> 02:48:21,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Conversely, even though boobs are relatively new,

2161
02:48:22,577 --> 02:48:27,084
[SPEAKER_08]: There's movies out there that a century ago would have been acceptable.

2162
02:48:27,165 --> 02:48:30,210
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not acceptable now like Force Over Nation.

2163
02:48:30,711 --> 02:48:31,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out in 1915.

2164
02:48:31,212 --> 02:48:31,332
[SPEAKER_08]: It was...

2165
02:48:33,343 --> 02:48:34,905
[SPEAKER_08]: TKK Movie

2166
02:48:57,825 --> 02:48:59,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Society kind of evolves.

2167
02:48:59,147 --> 02:49:01,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But it just seems like with video games, it's evolving slower.

2168
02:49:01,791 --> 02:49:02,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't get that.

2169
02:49:02,893 --> 02:49:04,775
[SPEAKER_05]: But Spazinator, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.

2170
02:49:04,795 --> 02:49:05,416
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

2171
02:49:05,657 --> 02:49:06,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, buddy, okay?

2172
02:49:07,659 --> 02:49:08,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, you too.

2173
02:49:08,320 --> 02:49:08,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

2174
02:49:52,034 --> 02:49:53,555
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2175
02:50:12,930 --> 02:50:17,494
[SPEAKER_06]: with his Don't Copy That 2, and apparently... Really?

2176
02:50:17,634 --> 02:50:19,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that shit was from the 80s.

2177
02:50:19,856 --> 02:50:31,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, he's from the 80s, and basically, based on the little video teaser he has, it looks like if you copy stuff off the internet, well, your parents will be dragged out in the street and beaten to death.

2178
02:50:33,247 --> 02:50:37,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds pretty accurate to me, but... Yes, awesome.

2179
02:50:38,854 --> 02:50:40,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, I gotta look at this here.

2180
02:50:40,115 --> 02:50:40,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

2181
02:50:40,715 --> 02:50:42,216
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a little preview here.

2182
02:50:42,636 --> 02:50:43,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if I can fast forward.

2183
02:50:49,240 --> 02:50:50,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is like a preview or something.

2184
02:50:50,740 --> 02:50:51,121
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no.

2185
02:50:51,141 --> 02:50:51,981
[SPEAKER_06]: They go through the songs.

2186
02:50:52,001 --> 02:50:53,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a second.

2187
02:50:53,482 --> 02:50:54,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta fast forward then, I guess.

2188
02:50:55,283 --> 02:50:56,804
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's right here.

2189
02:50:57,764 --> 02:50:59,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just a copy, it's a crime.

2190
02:50:59,245 --> 02:51:00,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just a copy, it's a crime.

2191
02:51:00,546 --> 02:51:02,046
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just a copy, it's a crime.

2192
02:51:02,066 --> 02:51:03,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just a copy, it's a crime.

2193
02:51:08,686 --> 02:51:09,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2194
02:51:09,808 --> 02:51:10,609
Fucking joke.

2195
02:51:11,791 --> 02:51:12,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2196
02:51:12,533 --> 02:51:14,115
[SPEAKER_06]: You missed the beginning part of it.

2197
02:51:14,216 --> 02:51:15,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't just sound like that.

2198
02:51:15,478 --> 02:51:16,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, whatever.

2199
02:51:16,059 --> 02:51:17,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm okay.

2200
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:19,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk It Out Walk It Out

2201
02:51:48,628 --> 02:51:49,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

2202
02:51:50,208 --> 02:51:50,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2203
02:51:51,869 --> 02:51:52,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously?

2204
02:51:53,349 --> 02:51:53,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

2205
02:51:54,769 --> 02:51:55,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Walking outdoors?

2206
02:51:55,990 --> 02:51:59,510
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently it is a rhythm game, so you know, you have to step to the beat.

2207
02:51:59,550 --> 02:52:00,710
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a game in it.

2208
02:52:00,750 --> 02:52:04,011
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a game to it, but it's walking outdoors.

2209
02:52:05,391 --> 02:52:05,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

2210
02:52:06,612 --> 02:52:06,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

2211
02:52:08,112 --> 02:52:09,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that for school credit.

2212
02:52:09,732 --> 02:52:11,653
[SPEAKER_06]: You play the game going to buy the game.

2213
02:52:14,473 --> 02:52:14,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

2214
02:52:15,033 --> 02:52:17,094
[SPEAKER_05]: On my YouTube project this week, we went outdoors.

2215
02:52:17,114 --> 02:52:17,994
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lot of fun, actually.

2216
02:52:20,233 --> 02:52:24,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Myst will be coming to the PlayStation Network for PSP July 16th.

2217
02:52:25,646 --> 02:52:26,528
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of neat.

2218
02:52:29,867 --> 02:52:30,427
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2219
02:52:57,722 --> 02:53:01,644
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a single player campaign as well as a four player co-op campaign.

2220
02:53:02,024 --> 02:53:02,785
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

2221
02:53:03,665 --> 02:53:05,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, we'll have a $200 controller too.

2222
02:53:05,306 --> 02:53:06,447
[SPEAKER_05]: That's optional.

2223
02:53:07,187 --> 02:53:07,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that?

2224
02:53:07,888 --> 02:53:08,848
[SPEAKER_06]: They never had that.

2225
02:53:08,948 --> 02:53:09,709
[SPEAKER_06]: That was something else.

2226
02:53:10,349 --> 02:53:11,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a mech game, wasn't it?

2227
02:53:11,490 --> 02:53:13,191
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a mech game, but it's not this mech game.

2228
02:53:13,211 --> 02:53:15,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's not that mech game, but it was some other game.

2229
02:53:16,018 --> 02:53:25,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Smith & Tinker has authorized MechTech to distribute MechWarrior 4 along with its expansions for free on the internet.

2230
02:53:25,966 --> 02:53:26,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chatters.

2231
02:53:26,727 --> 02:53:27,667
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68, Steel Battalion.

2232
02:53:27,708 --> 02:53:28,848
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the game I was trying to think of.

2233
02:53:30,370 --> 02:53:30,910
[SPEAKER_06]: On the internet.

2234
02:53:30,950 --> 02:53:35,994
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll actually be able to play MechWarrior 4 for free on Battletech.com soon enough.

2235
02:53:37,375 --> 02:53:38,796
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what we need in this world?

2236
02:53:39,417 --> 02:53:40,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Real mechs.

2237
02:53:40,237 --> 02:53:40,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2238
02:53:41,331 --> 02:53:42,031
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we need.

2239
02:53:42,291 --> 02:53:48,333
[SPEAKER_05]: How much would you pay to go to a place that was like an arena where nobody would really get hurt or really get blown up?

2240
02:53:48,353 --> 02:53:49,633
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be like laser tag, all right?

2241
02:53:49,933 --> 02:53:53,694
[SPEAKER_05]: But you would have real mechs that you would crawl into and get in.

2242
02:53:53,794 --> 02:53:54,814
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean robot jocks?

2243
02:53:55,034 --> 02:53:58,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that, where you would actually crawl in these giant machines.

2244
02:53:58,535 --> 02:54:00,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not talking about the shit at Dave & Buster's.

2245
02:54:00,515 --> 02:54:06,797
[SPEAKER_05]: You would actually walk around a giant arena outside with, like, you know, like bales of hay, obstacles, and stuff like that.

2246
02:54:06,817 --> 02:54:08,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, the thing at Dave & Buster's was sweet.

2247
02:54:08,917 --> 02:54:09,698
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2248
02:54:32,457 --> 02:54:36,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason in chat says, they have real mechs.

2249
02:54:36,159 --> 02:54:38,360
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a real Gundam in Japan, life-size.

2250
02:54:39,021 --> 02:54:41,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they actually do have one.

2251
02:54:41,102 --> 02:54:47,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were also working on, they did a Gigantor in another town.

2252
02:54:48,186 --> 02:54:50,047
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gundam was outside Tokyo.

2253
02:54:50,527 --> 02:54:52,048
[SPEAKER_05]: The mere thought gives me a semi.

2254
02:54:53,308 --> 02:54:56,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Carcassones coming to DS.

2255
02:54:57,472 --> 02:54:58,192
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of neat.

2256
02:54:59,233 --> 02:54:59,833
[SPEAKER_06]: That game's fun.

2257
02:55:00,453 --> 02:55:05,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, it needs to be some other game.

2258
02:55:06,976 --> 02:55:07,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, great.

2259
02:55:07,936 --> 02:55:09,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally forgot the name of the game.

2260
02:55:09,036 --> 02:55:09,416
[SPEAKER_05]: The Other?

2261
02:55:09,897 --> 02:55:20,521
[SPEAKER_06]: The Other game that's similar to this game that's also another board game turned Xbox Live Arcade game that I can't remember, but I played a lot of and played a lot of the board game and just...

2262
02:55:22,533 --> 02:55:23,595
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the other one?

2263
02:55:23,615 --> 02:55:24,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even remember, too.

2264
02:55:24,316 --> 02:55:28,442
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Carcassonne and there was... God, there was all the expansions for it, too.

2265
02:55:28,542 --> 02:55:29,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in chat will yell it out.

2266
02:55:29,764 --> 02:55:30,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Catan.

2267
02:55:30,505 --> 02:55:31,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Settlers of Catan.

2268
02:55:31,506 --> 02:55:31,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2269
02:55:32,007 --> 02:55:32,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2270
02:55:32,488 --> 02:55:33,529
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what needs to be on there.

2271
02:55:34,451 --> 02:55:36,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And I need memory in my brain.

2272
02:55:38,222 --> 02:55:42,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the PlayStation Network will be getting manga as well.

2273
02:55:43,129 --> 02:55:44,992
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually going to get some downloadable comics.

2274
02:55:45,393 --> 02:55:49,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, this has only been announced for the Japanese markets, but why not?

2275
02:55:49,358 --> 02:55:51,001
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2276
02:55:51,381 --> 02:55:51,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Neat idea.

2277
02:55:52,142 --> 02:55:53,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think that's a neat idea.

2278
02:55:54,505 --> 02:55:55,906
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little weird, but why not?

2279
02:55:55,946 --> 02:55:58,327
[SPEAKER_05]: We have these Amazon e-reader books.

2280
02:55:58,468 --> 02:56:00,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not manga on your PSP?

2281
02:56:00,569 --> 02:56:00,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

2282
02:56:00,989 --> 02:56:01,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'd be cool.

2283
02:56:02,010 --> 02:56:03,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't we see some of this, actually?

2284
02:56:03,691 --> 02:56:09,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there were some games that came out not that long ago that were kind of like this, like $20 comic books on the PSP.

2285
02:56:09,994 --> 02:56:11,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're talking about the Metal Gear Solid motion comics.

2286
02:56:11,775 --> 02:56:12,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, remember that?

2287
02:56:13,196 --> 02:56:13,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2288
02:56:13,416 --> 02:56:14,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are, yeah.

2289
02:56:14,337 --> 02:56:14,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, why not?

2290
02:56:16,527 --> 02:56:24,453
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a brand new mod for Half-Life 2, Neo Tokyo, which is actually, I believe, like a Tolkien version of the game.

2291
02:56:25,014 --> 02:56:34,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been released for the Source software development kit, and I think it will be available on Steam.

2292
02:56:35,401 --> 02:56:36,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually...

2293
02:56:37,683 --> 02:56:39,364
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2294
02:57:01,802 --> 02:57:10,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I think a while back we saw there was a graffiti type device created using the Wii Remote.

2295
02:57:11,168 --> 02:57:19,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of using similar things as the John Cho stuff where he created the virtual light boards.

2296
02:57:20,514 --> 02:57:26,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now you have the interactive white board thing using a Wii spray can.

2297
02:57:26,798 --> 02:57:29,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually apparently won a design prize.

2298
02:57:31,842 --> 02:57:33,923
[SPEAKER_06]: In Germany, which is pretty cool.

2299
02:57:34,624 --> 02:57:44,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess held by the German firm International Forum Design, WeSpray was one of the 377 finalists of the prestigious award.

2300
02:57:45,693 --> 02:57:48,515
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of finalists, but okay.

2301
02:57:50,051 --> 02:58:04,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then finally, um, Medal of Honor Heroes is the latest game on the PSP to be exploited to, uh, enable custom firmware and homebrew.

2302
02:58:04,954 --> 02:58:06,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, this also works.

2303
02:58:06,795 --> 02:58:09,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they've been, actually, they've tested it on the PSP-1000.

2304
02:58:09,775 --> 02:58:11,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it also works on the 3000.

2305
02:58:12,656 --> 02:58:17,357
[SPEAKER_06]: But, once again, going back to the beginning of the show and discussion about, you know,

2306
02:58:18,697 --> 02:58:26,148
[SPEAKER_06]: you know countermeasures for piracy and that type of thing no matter how hard you try there's someone always trying harder so that goes for both sides

2307
02:58:28,192 --> 02:58:30,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, a little lesson learned on tonight's show.

2308
02:58:30,353 --> 02:58:30,814
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2309
02:58:31,674 --> 02:58:32,215
[SPEAKER_05]: The more you know.

2310
02:58:32,415 --> 02:58:33,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, indeed, the more you know.

2311
02:58:34,076 --> 02:58:37,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, I guess that's going to wrap it up for tonight's show.

2312
02:58:37,998 --> 02:58:41,720
[SPEAKER_05]: And before we say goodnight, though, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2313
02:58:42,141 --> 02:58:46,103
[SPEAKER_05]: So, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight as you enjoy The Sims 3 for the rest of the evening.

2314
02:58:46,243 --> 02:58:47,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm spray painting sand.

2315
02:58:48,285 --> 02:58:49,205
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that noise I hear.

2316
02:58:50,006 --> 02:58:51,386
[SPEAKER_05]: What color are you spraying sand?

2317
02:58:51,667 --> 02:58:53,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually turning the ground into sand.

2318
02:58:53,988 --> 02:58:55,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using the terrain paints.

2319
02:58:57,029 --> 02:59:01,773
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I'm actually kind of craving Del Taco and I'm hoping the one in Rockland is open late.

2320
02:59:02,613 --> 02:59:03,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm driving out there tonight.

2321
02:59:03,954 --> 02:59:05,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want Del Taco.

2322
02:59:06,376 --> 02:59:07,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Mmm, Del Taco.

2323
02:59:07,617 --> 02:59:08,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

2324
02:59:10,039 --> 02:59:14,202
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I need to play more games this week.

2325
02:59:14,322 --> 02:59:19,005
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, in the absence of playing games, I've been unpacking and I'm almost done.

2326
02:59:19,866 --> 02:59:20,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

2327
02:59:20,667 --> 02:59:25,250

2332
