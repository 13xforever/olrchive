1
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:19,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, July 19th, 2009, Dragon Quest IX might get DLC as it sells oodles of copies.

2
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Could your mall soon get a Microsoft Store next to the Apple Store?

3
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:27,198
[SPEAKER_07]: And Capcom finally admits something we've always known about Street Fighter IV.

4
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:42,216
[SPEAKER_06]: We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:49,982
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week are the awesome co-hosts that help make up OLR with me, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:52,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Greetings and salutations.

8
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:52,908
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Ms.

9
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:53,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Summers?

10
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,269
[SPEAKER_10]: In pain.

11
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:55,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of it.

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too this week.

13
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've got your hand thing going on, but oh my god.

14
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,073
[SPEAKER_10]: But Vicodin makes it better.

15
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:01,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Vicodin does make it better.

16
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:03,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish Vicodin made heat stroke better.

17
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:09,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Vicodin, however, means I cannot drink the delicious bottle of wine that's sitting on my counter in the kitchen.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,060
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can!

19
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,322
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it'll make my heat thing worse.

20
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:15,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll explain that in a minute.

21
00:01:15,203 --> 00:01:16,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you're welcome to as much lemonade as you like.

22
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:18,205
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:47,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Crap, I was too lazy to say no, so I had to go volunteer at this place called the Grace Foundation.

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,193
[SPEAKER_03]: They rescue horses and stuff, and I had to go stay in a fence.

25
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:51,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,036
[SPEAKER_06]: You volunteered for horses this week?

27
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:59,320
[SPEAKER_03]: No, what it is is I forgot to say no to volunteering, you know, painting fences.

28
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:00,927
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

29
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:09,902
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

30
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:12,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some aloe vera at home that's awesome because it's from Canada.

31
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:17,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have different drugs up there that you can get at the drugstore you can't get here because Canadians rock.

32
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:18,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you, Canada.

33
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,395
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have this aloe vera gel that comes with lidocaine in it, which is the same stuff that dentists will use to numb your teeth.

34
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:24,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

35
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,498
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like prescription strength over here.

36
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:29,159
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also get it with bentocaine, though.

37
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:29,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

38
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:30,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my arm thread.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

40
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:31,861
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

41
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:34,003
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

42
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:50,870
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:16,930
[SPEAKER_11]: So the box is getting sterilized.

44
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:24,235
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sitting outside with that green spray on it in the front yard on the porch.

45
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:28,978
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got on my hands and knees and scrubbed out the bottom of the closet.

46
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:32,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And Shermie's bathroom is freaking clean.

47
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:33,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, congrats.

48
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:38,525
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've had to go out and spray down her big old litter box today.

49
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:45,323
[SPEAKER_06]: To answer some questions from chat, and of course we always have the fourth guest on our show, the chatroom, chat.orangellandradio.com.

50
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:48,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Fear of the Claws starts off with, what's the Vicodin for?

51
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:49,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is Jamie on it?

52
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:50,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed a couple episodes.

53
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:52,508
[SPEAKER_06]: She had hand surgery, right?

54
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:57,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I had trigger finger release surgery.

55
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:59,013
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to, I'm not going to explain it again.

56
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:03,556
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys want to know what it is, it's online on many, many websites.

57
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:05,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think she explained it a couple episodes back.

58
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,619
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll put something in the chatroom.

59
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:11,000
[SPEAKER_06]: The podcast is lagging an episode behind, which is totally my fault.

60
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:15,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a dummy, I ran out of here last week and left the USB drive in the computer.

61
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:20,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never had a chance to get back home or come back over here and grab the USB drive.

62
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Jamie lives a good 30 minutes from me.

63
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:24,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the USB stick and upload the show.

64
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,448
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully the last week's show will finally hit the podcast feed tonight.

65
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And I apologize.

66
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I know people miss it when we don't get the show up on time.

67
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:31,750
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wasn't home.

68
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not slept in my own bed since Wednesday night.

69
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:37,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also about to post the link for what trigger finger release surgery is.

70
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,462
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, if you want to educate yourself.

71
00:04:58,142 --> 00:04:59,944
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's get into our gaming weeks.

72
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:00,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I found a video of it.

73
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew, don't... See, here's the thing.

74
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not do well with blood squeamishness.

75
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:07,449
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's actually really funny?

76
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:14,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't mind Mortal Kombat type of games or Trauma Center or all the fake cartoon blood.

77
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:21,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a very good mind that can distinguish, you know, as I'm sure a lot of you do, that can distinguish fake blood from real blood.

78
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:22,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Even horror movies.

79
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:23,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I've gone into a...

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,621
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

81
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:44,917
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

82
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:06,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you, but still, I just wanted to barf.

83
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:09,014
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember when that exhibit was coming through town?

84
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to go to that!

85
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:13,716
[SPEAKER_06]: The bodies revealed that they were advertising on the radio for like six months.

86
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:18,837
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just basically all these corpses that they've opened up so you can see everything.

87
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:30,520
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's actually really cool because what they've done, they've actually set them in everyday poses like in office positions or in play positions so that you can see the way that the muscles... But they're people!

88
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,421
[SPEAKER_11]: They donated themselves.

89
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:31,801
[SPEAKER_11]: However...

90
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:36,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they knew that hair could be donated for an exhibit.

91
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:37,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

92
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:38,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't deal with it.

93
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,323
[SPEAKER_11]: They're donated for scientific research.

94
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:53,327
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, well, as a massage therapist, I wanted to see it because for... Now, I'll tell you what the biggest thing that got me over my gross factor with bodies is watching cadaver videos.

95
00:06:55,015 --> 00:07:02,038
[SPEAKER_11]: and once you see muscles moving on their own, it's sort of... I'm going to barf.

96
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:02,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

97
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Just not the type of stuff I'm into.

98
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, kittens.

99
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I love kittens.

100
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:06,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

101
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:07,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate you.

102
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:17,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get video games, Mortal Kombat, Ripping Heads Off, HeHe, Funny.

103
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:18,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that shit.

104
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:20,033
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the real stuff.

105
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:21,614
[SPEAKER_06]: My brain can totally tell the difference.

106
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:22,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Fake blood in movies I hate.

107
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:24,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Other people's blood I hate.

108
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,897
[SPEAKER_11]: My own, I have no freaking problem with it.

109
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:27,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, even my own.

110
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:32,140
[SPEAKER_11]: And they would not let me watch my surgery, but he did let me watch them do the anesthetic.

111
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Shermie.

112
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:36,650
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me a lot to look at the pictures of what it looked like.

113
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they showed me a picture of my gallbladder before and after.

114
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:43,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they actually put the laparoscopic camera in there when I had my surgery last October.

115
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:46,594
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually showed the pictures of what my inside looked like with and without it.

116
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:49,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me like four days before I was ready to look at that picture.

117
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:52,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when I finally did, I was like, I looked at it.

118
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:56,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I kind of like cocked my head to the side like a kitten looking at the TV or something.

119
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:58,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And looked at it for about ten more seconds.

120
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh my god, I'm going to barf.

121
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I never looked at it again.

122
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Shermie would not say anything for everybody, by the way.

123
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,964
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a little mic-shy today.

124
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:08,526
[SPEAKER_11]: She also needs a bath.

125
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:14,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, I don't want to talk anymore about internal body organs and stuff like that, unless it's into video games.

126
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:17,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, it just...

127
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:27,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Blows my mind, you know, when I hear this stuff about he who shall not be named, you know, Jack Voldemort, the once lawyer from Florida, who's, you know, a total attention whore.

128
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:28,184
[SPEAKER_11]: The freaking loser.

129
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:32,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Who, yeah, always talks about, you know, how video games lead to real violence.

130
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:34,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, can't people tell the difference?

131
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't have a problem being able to distinguish the two.

132
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:42,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a physical reaction to the real stuff as compared to the fake stuff.

133
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:44,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you telling me a lot of people don't have that?

134
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:45,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I heard about it.

135
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:46,677
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up on YouTube, apparently.

136
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:49,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have to watch that because I love bullshit.

137
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:53,362
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually did one debunking the video game violence myth.

138
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:55,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, we haven't already.

139
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:56,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I crazy?

140
00:08:57,826 --> 00:08:59,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone in chat like me?

141
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:05,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I see a lot of people going, oh, I went to that exhibit or, oh, cool, I think those exhibits are neat or I couldn't believe that they were real people.

142
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:08,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Is anyone like me or am I just a big pussy?

143
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:10,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I'm – that's fine.

144
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:10,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I can admit it.

145
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:11,338
[SPEAKER_06]: It's –

146
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,099
[SPEAKER_11]: He brought Bob, it's really nothing.

147
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,201
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of people who have that problem.

148
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:16,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just the way you're wired.

149
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that exhibit was there, otherwise I probably would have gone.

150
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I really wanted to go, I just couldn't afford it at the time.

151
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:30,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I wouldn't have wanted to go because it's an art exhibit, and that's just... I don't know, if they could bring the exhibit to me, then maybe.

152
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:33,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, I hear Gold Anthros has me, Sky.

153
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:33,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, I'm not alone.

154
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:35,096
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way... What?

155
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:38,292
[SPEAKER_11]: My brother Phillip has now added me on Facebook.

156
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:41,313
[SPEAKER_11]: My mother and my stepfather have added me on Facebook.

157
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:45,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is my family suddenly becoming technologically with the times?

158
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:53,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to figure out how to set up those filters on Facebook because I'm getting more and more coworkers on Facebook, which, you know, just my work life is very different from my personal life.

159
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:54,438
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing personal.

160
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:59,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry, Facebook will eventually be phased out or replaced by something else that's grander.

161
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:06,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon enough, it'll happen and everybody won't realize it until the news reports on it retarded people.

162
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:07,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Technically, he didn't add me.

163
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:10,431
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually came up as a suggestion.

164
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:14,694
[SPEAKER_11]: But my mom, my uncle, and my stepfather have added me all on Facebook.

165
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

166
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:19,838
[SPEAKER_11]: So my mom actually now knows that I am just as potty-mouthed as she is.

167
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:20,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Completely off-topic here.

168
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:20,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

169
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what else is new here on Orange Lounge Radio?

170
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,790
[SPEAKER_03]: No, well, it's on the show.

171
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the show, but not necessarily on topic with corpses.

172
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:32,672
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

173
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:33,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

174
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,552
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, all right.

175
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:40,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, I found a hard drive lying around the other day, and I decided to look on.

176
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:49,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was the old hard drive out of my computer that was in the arcade cabinet, but it had some of the old shows on it from I don't know when.

177
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:53,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even listen to any of them, but they're older shows.

178
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:55,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I already backed it all up to my computer.

179
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you burn me a DVD of the files?

180
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:18,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we've had the listeners begging for episode one for years.

181
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,620
[SPEAKER_11]: God, that's a bad migraine.

182
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:26,643
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't think the show was going to last a year back then, so we just labeled them all with the actual dates.

183
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,664
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't start numbering them until episode 40 or something.

184
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:34,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's why I have... I don't know if it's the first ones.

185
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:37,568
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no year on it, so I was like, I don't know when these are from.

186
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's the first year of the show.

187
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:43,325
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to put that stuff up in the archive that we have online.

188
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:44,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I also found all my MAME ROMs on there.

189
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:45,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, sweet!

190
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:47,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

191
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, cool.

192
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:49,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Hook up that drive.

193
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:51,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get the listeners too excited.

194
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:52,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It completely works, too.

195
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:55,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why it stopped working on yours.

196
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:57,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It is partitioned like six times, though.

197
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:57,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of weird.

198
00:11:58,781 --> 00:11:59,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

199
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:00,164
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

200
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:29,714
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of Sims 3 because that's really all I can play.

201
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:39,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fortunate thing is that my mouse is one of the thumb track balls, so it keeps my hand in a neutral position and it doesn't really hurt so much.

202
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,039
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've been playing a lot of that.

203
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried playing some pinball, but yeah, that didn't quite work.

204
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:58,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I downloaded Loom last week on Steam, and I was gonna play that, and I loaded it up, and then I was like, oh wait, I have to do stuff, so I didn't play it.

205
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,459
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do have it now.

206
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,680
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really about it.

207
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:03,141
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you do?

208
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:08,306
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, I played Grand Theft Auto 4, the modified version that I'm still playing.

209
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally got it down to the point where...

210
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:21,035
[SPEAKER_03]: We tweaked a few more things and we're at a point where we can kind of stop messing with it for a while until I find something really cool to do with it.

211
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:23,916
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's been pretty fun.

212
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:24,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Very crazy.

213
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:26,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably pissing a lot of people off because I keep winning.

214
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:28,759
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not on purpose.

215
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:36,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just I've adapted to the new weapons pretty quick and they forget that some of the weapons explode on contact with helicopters or flying cars.

216
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:37,845
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

217
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:39,669
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

218
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to see if it'll actually be able to keep up with it.

219
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:12,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus I found some other device that'll actually capture in HD, which is pretty cool.

220
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:14,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'll have to pick that up later on.

221
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,842
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's really all I played.

222
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:25,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bunch of stuff sitting around like I should have been playing, but I've been busy working on the house and working on other things.

223
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,352
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's basically Grand Theft Auto is the only thing I had time for.

224
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:37,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I watched Jim play RPG Maker 3, which is kind of funny.

225
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:38,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that's right.

226
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:40,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the RPG Maker 3 on PlayStation 2.

227
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,373
[SPEAKER_06]: That game seems very intricate for a PlayStation 2 game.

228
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:45,634
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot that you can do with it.

229
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:47,375
[SPEAKER_10]: You should have seen the old RPG Makers.

230
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:48,336
[SPEAKER_10]: The SNES ones?

231
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:53,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised they don't have a new one out on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

232
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough, they didn't sell well.

233
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:59,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember selling RPG Maker 3 and I thought, oh my god, this is fucking awesome.

234
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,785
[SPEAKER_03]: But no one seemed to get it.

235
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,826
[SPEAKER_11]: No one really likes to do anything they actually have to work at.

236
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:06,026
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very cult kind of game.

237
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:06,967
[SPEAKER_03]: It is tough.

238
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:17,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to say ZZT would be pretty awesome, but ZZT, the only difference between that and this, ZZT's game actually was pretty good.

239
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,671
[SPEAKER_03]: The standalone game that came with it.

240
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:26,433
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't really show you how to make levels and stuff like that, but you could look at it and stuff.

241
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:27,113
[SPEAKER_03]: But

242
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:32,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I also had a really powerful editor with it, whereas RPG Maker 3, they have a really crappy game that's with it.

243
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,394
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not very polished.

244
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:36,814
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of, hey, look, here's what you can do with the engine, done.

245
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:40,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't you expect, though, that somebody's going to bring an RPG Maker, especially the PlayStation 3?

246
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:47,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Because look, you've got your little big planet, you've got your motor, what's the kart racing game that's coming out on PlayStation 3?

247
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:47,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Mod Nation.

248
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:48,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Mod Nation, thank you.

249
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:51,978
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got these kind of games coming out that are about creating and sharing a community.

250
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't it seem logical that a role-playing game is going to come out at some point?

251
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:54,959
[SPEAKER_03]: They should.

252
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:55,639
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be cool.

253
00:15:56,673 --> 00:16:00,117
[SPEAKER_03]: But they probably won't.

254
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:04,922
[SPEAKER_03]: They've had a few of them come out in Japan, and they just haven't really taken off.

255
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:16,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the company that used to make them on PC went out of business, and now it's being carried on with people modding the actual files and doing freeware updates and stuff like that.

256
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,190
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

257
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, is that it for your gaming week?

258
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:44,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

259
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,106
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

260
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:36,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel really bad saying that because I'm sure this was created by an independent developer studio and some of these people took a lot of time and put energy into this game, but it's not worth your money because I think somewhere they got lost in the concept.

261
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:41,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very clear that this game was very proud of its concept.

262
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:41,885
[SPEAKER_06]: And it should be.

263
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:44,347
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all sitting here going, oh, it sounds like a cool game.

264
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:46,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what really sold me on buying the game.

265
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:50,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a good thing Nintendo Wii doesn't have demos or I probably would have figured that out a lot sooner.

266
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh, got me.

267
00:17:52,311 --> 00:17:59,616
[SPEAKER_06]: But the game itself is this just bad Pac-Man ripoff where you... I shouldn't say ripoff.

268
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:00,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a ripoff.

269
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:05,219
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a Pac-Man-ish type of game where you move through a maze and you collect, you know...

270
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:09,076
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

271
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,416
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't change by the time you get to the 128-bit version.

272
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:36,860
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still playing the same damn game where you're moving throughout a maze trying to get the little cubes and avoid the monsters.

273
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:42,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just completely unimaginative when you get from the 4-bit to the super game.

274
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I really think that they should...

275
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:46,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Copyright Orange Zones Radio

276
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:02,171
[SPEAKER_06]: The genre didn't involve at all in this game.

277
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:04,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and, you know, some might argue with me.

278
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:07,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I even tried, like, looking on the website, kind of seeing, like, who was in this game and stuff.

279
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:21,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And the game definitely has its fans who are not responding well to the negative reviews out there on the internet saying, well, it's a game about competing for points and it's all this, you know, the game does evolve because in the Wii version you can flick the Wiimote to jump or something.

280
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,196
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm sorry.

281
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:23,396
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just...

282
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:24,976
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

283
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:49,089
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

284
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:15,166
[SPEAKER_06]: 32-bit version of the game has long load times.

285
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So you actually have to sit there between each level and wait for the game to load.

286
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:21,007
[SPEAKER_06]: When you know damn well it's not loading anything.

287
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:23,368
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a little, ha ha ha, isn't that funny?

288
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:25,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember loading times.

289
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:28,389
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's novel the game.

290
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:32,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's like, gee, weren't the 80s cool?

291
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,250
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?

292
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that Goat Boy on Saturday Night Live?

293
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:36,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Weren't the 80s cool?

294
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:37,851
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this.

295
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,892
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we had bad hair and a flock of seagulls.

296
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,512
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically what it is.

297
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:47,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unfortunately, BitBoy, the game, not a fan.

298
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:47,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

299
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:58,505
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it was a little tiny studio that put the game together, but my advice, you guys, if some of them should actually hear this show or the fans hear this show, you've got to evolve the genre of the game with the game.

300
00:20:58,585 --> 00:20:58,986
[SPEAKER_06]: For me...

301
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:02,548
[SPEAKER_06]: The game didn't change between the 4-bit and the 128-bit.

302
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,649
[SPEAKER_06]: What really changed?

303
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:07,512
[SPEAKER_06]: The graphics, and now you can flick your Wiimote to jump or whatever.

304
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:08,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not enough.

305
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:20,081
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end, it's still about competing for a high score, which works for an Atari 2600-style game, but games weren't about just competing for high scores when you moved on into the later generations.

306
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:21,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what they forgot.

307
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:25,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that speaks so true to life, because really, people never change.

308
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:28,167
[SPEAKER_03]: You just get older and then are able to flick their Wiimote.

309
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:30,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

310
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:34,179
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't recommend BitBoy, sorry.

311
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:42,620
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as other games I played this week on the Wii, a newer type of exercise game that came out from EA called EA Active.

312
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:50,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a gift card for my birthday I finally spent this week and I decided I was going to take the plunge because I've gained quite a bit of weight.

313
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:54,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year I lost a lot of weight when I had my surgery.

314
00:21:54,962 --> 00:22:00,443
[SPEAKER_06]: As I'm sure a lot of you guys know, I didn't have gastric bypass, I had gallbladder surgery, but with all the sickness I had last year

315
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:01,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

316
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:31,404
[SPEAKER_06]: and I thought okay I'm going to pick up this new game this EA Active because what I like about it from what I'm hearing on the box is that it has this customized training program and that's what I need because Wii Fit, what's Wii Fit?

317
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:47,176
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a clusterfuck of games and a way for you to measure your body fat once in a while but if I don't really know what I'm doing or what exercises I ought to be playing that's one thing that Wii Fit really falls short in is that it's just kind of all these exercises and you kind of have to know what parts of the body you want to exercise but

318
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,438
[SPEAKER_06]: EA Active has a 30-day program.

319
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:54,162
[SPEAKER_06]: So I bought the game, decided to check it out, and okay, it's not bad.

320
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:58,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It does support the Wii Balance Board, but it's not required to play.

321
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:04,710
[SPEAKER_06]: The game basically has two little add-ons that come with it that are extremely cheap, but you gotta consider the game costs $59.99.

322
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:16,220
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the peripherals is basically a gigantic rubber band that you put these two straps on that's like a resistance band, which is actually... Resistance bands are great.

323
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's actually kind of a creative, cheap exercise tool.

324
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:21,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta give him credit for that.

325
00:23:22,225 --> 00:23:25,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually works for doing bicep curls and things of that nature.

326
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:33,996
[SPEAKER_06]: The game also comes with a strap that you strap to your leg that you put the nun check in that would be ten times more awesome if it didn't keep falling off my leg while I'm exercising.

327
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:38,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even as tight as I will make that thing, inevitably it slips off my leg and starts to fall.

328
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,782
[SPEAKER_06]: It needed to have something where I could maybe clip it onto my...

329
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:43,825
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

330
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but it comes with this thing with an uncheck and it's kind of neat.

331
00:24:02,384 --> 00:24:03,945
[SPEAKER_06]: It allows for all these different types of activities.

332
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:12,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one thing I did notice about EA Active is that it is set up more like a, hey, this is an exercise program and we're going to show you all these videos that show you how to do the exercise.

333
00:24:12,474 --> 00:24:13,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you're going to do the exercise.

334
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:21,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really felt like, granted, I don't have numbers to put side by side, but I did feel like EA Active has a higher variety of exercises in them.

335
00:24:22,603 --> 00:24:51,732
[SPEAKER_06]: as far as the fun factor though I don't think EA Active is necessarily has the cutesy fun look of Wii Fit the really motivating type of like you know cutesy let's have a good time Wii Party type of thing I didn't really see that in EA Active it's a little more serious and the graphics don't really even seem as good as Wii Fit but you have to consider what is this game for it's not there to be cute and amusing and entertaining it's there to help you exercise and it does get that job done fairly well my biggest bitch

336
00:24:52,492 --> 00:25:01,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the trying to watch your body do these motions, the game is not very good at picking up.

337
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,015
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one in particular, the lunges you do on your feet.

338
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:09,696
[SPEAKER_06]: You basically lunge down, kind of like you crouch with one leg and bend your other leg at a 45 degree angle.

339
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:12,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I am having the hardest time with the game picking this up.

340
00:25:12,317 --> 00:25:17,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm doing them the right way and everything, but there's no way to tell the game, okay, I'm doing it, just move on.

341
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:23,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you are not doing the exercise correctly, you kind of have to twist and move your body until the game picks up.

342
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was literally sitting there for like a minute, two minutes.

343
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:26,843
[SPEAKER_06]: That could injure you.

344
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:27,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

345
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:29,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to move around, getting the game to detect me, and it wouldn't do it.

346
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:33,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So eventually I had to hit the button to skip the entire exercise.

347
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't get credit for doing the exercise.

348
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:39,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wish there was a way you could just like hit the two button or something and skip...

349
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

350
00:25:57,273 --> 00:25:58,974
[SPEAKER_06]: None of them are recognizable songs.

351
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:09,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you consider a company like EA usually licenses pretty good music for a game like Burnout and so on, the fact that they couldn't do the same for a game like this is really disappointing.

352
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:16,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe they're waiting to see how a game like this is received so that they can do it in the sequel or something like that, but I really just wanted to turn the damn thing off and put on my own music.

353
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,960
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just having expansions.

354
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:21,610
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already announced them, yeah.

355
00:26:39,997 --> 00:26:40,497
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

356
00:27:07,623 --> 00:27:09,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

357
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:32,108
[SPEAKER_03]: or hello, support the goddamn SD memory card, put your own MP3s on there.

358
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:32,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

359
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:37,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing I should point out, you don't have to have the balance board to play this game.

360
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:44,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it goes a long way in making some of the other activities a little more fun, but technically, you don't have to have it.

361
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:48,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're willing to endure without the balance board, you can pick up this game for $59.99.

362
00:27:49,854 --> 00:28:17,916
[SPEAKER_06]: not a bad deal so on EA's part that's actually kind of smart because it puts out an exercise game that's cheaper than Wii Fit yet also enhances Wii Fit I gotta credit EA with that one so that was pretty much my gaming week was those two games and I'm still feeling sore from just the two days of Wii workout I did earlier in the week I skipped yesterday I have to do some when I go home tonight because I don't want to miss a day because I have to be thin and beautiful before the Reno show in August so alright

363
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:20,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's see.

364
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:22,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got an idea, by the way.

365
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:22,628
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

366
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:26,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was showing off screen caps of the house that I made in The Sims.

367
00:28:26,735 --> 00:28:28,819
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking about doing OLR exclusives.

368
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

369
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:30,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, why not?

370
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:31,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

371
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:38,276
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I will do, as soon as I can actually get to a point where I can save that property, I will do exclusive Sims.

372
00:28:38,396 --> 00:28:39,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I should make ones of you guys.

373
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:40,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

374
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:41,138
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got one of me.

375
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:42,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be fine.

376
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:43,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be fine with that.

377
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Reading some comments from chat, chat.orangehoundsradio.com, Xenocore says, Rob, screw this EA crap.

378
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:52,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Get you some P90X interactive online extreme.

379
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Work out until your insides come out.

380
00:28:54,326 --> 00:28:56,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not aware of this game.

381
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:57,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's something I need to do more research on.

382
00:28:57,989 --> 00:28:59,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be okay with looking that up.

383
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:01,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds interesting.

384
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:08,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the idea of an online game where I can kind of get motivated with friends and in a community.

385
00:29:08,472 --> 00:29:12,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's one big thing that the Wii workout programs are missing.

386
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:13,853
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, you know what?

387
00:29:14,493 --> 00:29:24,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hope that when Project Natal comes out a big, big exercise game is not far behind because I think one place where Xbox Live is going to really blow these Wii games out of the water is the online component.

388
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:26,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be very interesting to see what that brings to the table.

389
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:28,197
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm curious about the other game.

390
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:29,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll check it out, I guess.

391
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:30,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's necessarily a game.

392
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:36,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an extreme home fitness training system, they call it.

393
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:37,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

394
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:38,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Sucker.

395
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:39,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a sucker.

396
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:41,525
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?

397
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:44,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like working out hard.

398
00:29:45,188 --> 00:29:45,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

399
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:46,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll check it out.

400
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:47,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll Google it.

401
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,270
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

402
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on, though, with some housekeeping tonight quickly.

403
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:54,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore says, please tell me he knows that's a joke.

404
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:55,515
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't know it's a joke.

405
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:56,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd never heard of it before.

406
00:29:57,383 --> 00:29:58,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Loki, for doing the research.

407
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:23,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I was also going to say, I believe they did a blog for EA Sports Active, the 30-day challenge.

408
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, I don't know if they're starting it again.

409
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there's someone else that's taking the 30-day challenge.

410
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:36,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Moore basically said that you'll lose weight after 30 days or something like that.

411
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:53,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to find they had one person that actually completed it and I wanted to see what the results were unfortunately I cannot oh here we go you know what's funny I am using the Wii Fit channel to weigh myself in every day

412
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:59,129
[SPEAKER_06]: J-Rod in chat said, Richard Simmons presents Sweetin' to the 80s.

413
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:00,849
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

414
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:03,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I would actually buy a game like that.

415
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Say what you want about how odd Richard Simmons is, but you know what?

416
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:08,212
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a highly motivating guy.

417
00:31:08,312 --> 00:31:12,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And what bad thing has he ever done besides being a little bit weird, right?

418
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:17,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, my mother loves him.

419
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:18,252
[SPEAKER_03]: No joke.

420
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:19,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's fantastic.

421
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:20,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he is too.

422
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:23,378
[SPEAKER_03]: This person actually did it for 30 days.

423
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:25,560
[SPEAKER_03]: They started off that their weight was 235 and some other...

424
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:32,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Habits he also, I guess, brought on.

425
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:42,522
[SPEAKER_03]: He drank half his body weight in fluid ounces of water, which is, you know, you're supposed to, so like 120 ounces of water a day.

426
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:56,548
[SPEAKER_03]: This is roughly 500 calories before resting, like 150 grams of protein, four to six small meals, avoided carbs, and plenty of fiber.

427
00:31:57,528 --> 00:31:58,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyways, besides all that,

428
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:03,994
[SPEAKER_03]: and did the exercises, they lost 12.5 pounds in three days.

429
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:05,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

430
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:06,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad.

431
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:07,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not bad.

432
00:32:07,895 --> 00:32:10,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And you notice, though, it's about changing other lifestyles, too.

433
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:15,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Which the game will tell you, it'll kind of walk you through that, but it's not like the game can tell what you ate yesterday.

434
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:24,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, drinking water's good, eating lots of, you know, meals, you know, smaller meals instead of big meals, you know, something I really needed to do.

435
00:32:25,305 --> 00:32:26,866
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I starve myself until lunch.

436
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,647
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not healthy.

437
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:29,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's not.

438
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:35,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I go get the third pounder burger, which is really not healthy, but I don't care.

439
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:35,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

440
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,208
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get into some actual gaming.

441
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,048
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

442
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:13,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

443
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:14,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't mind a tapeworm.

444
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:15,830
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are disgusting.

445
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:22,915
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that's important about these types of games, you're not going to get thin just buying the game and looking at the box.

446
00:33:23,455 --> 00:33:26,697
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, you're not going to get thin buying the game and playing it for five minutes a day.

447
00:33:27,157 --> 00:33:34,562
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, you're not going to get thin by buying the game, playing it for 30 minutes one day out of an entire week.

448
00:33:34,782 --> 00:33:37,684
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to make a commitment to exercise five times a week.

449
00:33:38,864 --> 00:33:58,889
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'm taking that walking class they say you need to get your heart rate up for 20 minutes a day or at least 3 times a week get your heart rate up to at least 65% of your max heart rate and then hold it there for at least 20 minutes and that's the way to do it

450
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:03,439
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so think carefully before you jump into one of these Wii exercise programs.

451
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:09,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they can work because I think anything is better than your big butt sitting on the couch playing a game for 30 minutes.

452
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:12,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you're up and moving, that's certainly better than that.

453
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:14,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, let's move on.

454
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:18,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into some gaming stories tonight, and Loki's going to start us off with some gaming discussion.

455
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:26,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Dragon Quest IX came out just last week, and of course, it's already sold millions of copies.

456
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:31,263
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it sold 2.3 million copies in two days, which is pretty awesome.

457
00:34:31,643 --> 00:34:36,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally blowing away any other game that was coming out that week, or actually even out at the time.

458
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:40,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Just completely knocked everything out of the water as far as sales goes.

459
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,487
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, you know, Dragon Quest is a huge series in Japan.

460
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:47,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so much over here, but, you know, hey, we're working on it.

461
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:52,614
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

462
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:59,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a big surprise that it did well, but hopefully it'll do well when it comes over here.

463
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:03,214
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably won't.

464
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not going to do that good.

465
00:35:05,495 --> 00:35:12,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I think definitely Dragon Quest has its fans that will justify Square translating the game and bringing it out over here.

466
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:17,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I think they do lose a little bit in sales from not doing it a little faster.

467
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:22,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think you do get people that import the game and or steal the game while it's out in Japan.

468
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,621
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think they need to get their turnaround times down a bit.

469
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:27,821
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the game will still sell decent enough.

470
00:35:27,902 --> 00:35:28,522
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's just face it.

471
00:35:29,722 --> 00:35:49,763
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not Halo or Madden or the things we go crazy about in this country True Although Dragon Quest IX certainly has its fans Although people do go crazy for Final Fantasy I think Final Fantasy has a bit more name recognition And also keep in mind that Dragon Quest had a different name when we first got them over here, remember?

472
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Nintendo Generation Final Fantasy 2 and 3

473
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:13,520
[SPEAKER_06]: True, true, I understand.

474
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that was a big marketing push, too.

475
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:20,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I think even though we had Dragon Quest VII was out on the PlayStation 1, I don't remember ever hearing about it.

476
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:23,748
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really Dragon Quest VIII where they really started pushing it.

477
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:26,990
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was also the first game under the Square Enix banner, if I remember right.

478
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:31,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Enix just didn't have the marketing push here in America that it did over in Japan.

479
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a big part of it.

480
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:33,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

481
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:40,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear this game has been getting a lot of negative feedback on Amazon.com, although I guess that ultimately doesn't matter now, does it?

482
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:43,695
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the sales that drive it, not the ratings.

483
00:36:44,515 --> 00:36:47,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Although it would be interesting to see what happens next week.

484
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:51,237
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if the sales numbers take a big dive or what happens.

485
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:55,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Orland in chat says, Final Fantasy is dead.

486
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:56,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

487
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:57,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

488
00:36:58,126 --> 00:36:59,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Final Fantasy XIII is going to do well.

489
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:00,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that it's dead.

490
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:03,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's... I think that it'll lull.

491
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:10,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's as popular as it was in the PlayStation 1 era, but I think the games will still sell like crazy.

492
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:15,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I think XIII is going to be the biggest selling RPG on both platforms, both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

493
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:19,259
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still not going to sell Halo-sized numbers, that's for sure.

494
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:21,600
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'll be a big game.

495
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:23,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe combined it will.

496
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:25,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

497
00:37:26,886 --> 00:37:28,187
[SPEAKER_06]: X Mark the End of Good Final Fantasy Games

498
00:37:47,486 --> 00:37:48,507
[SPEAKER_06]: is that it really missed out.

499
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:52,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XI, that's a whole other thing.

500
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:56,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Final Fantasy XI should have just been Final Fantasy Online.

501
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the whole fact that they did an online game with a number really turned some people off.

502
00:38:01,052 --> 00:38:01,492
[SPEAKER_06]: But guess what?

503
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,233
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to happen again with Final Fantasy XIV.

504
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:06,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care because I'm buying Final Fantasy XIV.

505
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:08,175
[SPEAKER_03]: XI was fun for a while.

506
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:13,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, it had its rough spots in the beginning, but now a lot of that stuff has been patched out.

507
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:13,678
[SPEAKER_03]: But

508
00:38:15,274 --> 00:38:18,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I still enjoyed it even with all the frustrations of it.

509
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:23,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I would still be playing it today if I had the time to play it, but I don't.

510
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not.

511
00:38:25,882 --> 00:38:26,563
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was awesome.

512
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I wouldn't be going to WoW.

513
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:29,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that shit.

514
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:32,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft reminds us in chat, Famitsu gave it a perfect score.

515
00:38:32,905 --> 00:38:38,548
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, Dragon Quest IX got a perfect score in Famitsu, which is the first... Damn near impossible, too.

516
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:43,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the first Dragon Quest game to do so, actually, which is kind of surprising.

517
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:51,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's funny because you have that, and then you have the Amazon.com reviews where a lot of the users are slamming the game, but I don't know, is that just angry internet wank?

518
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:54,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the internet is angry.

519
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to tell until I actually buy the game myself, but we'll see.

520
00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:15,059
[SPEAKER_06]: by the way, I guess more and more games I remember when that was a hella hard thing to get was a perfect 40 in Famitsu Magazine there was only like 4 games that had it for the longest time now there's like 10 or 11 that have gotten a perfect 10 yeah, they're starting to move to the IGN scoring method there

521
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:19,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Nintendogs was one of the games that got a perfect 40 in the history.

522
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:24,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a perfect 40 for the first 40 minutes, and then after that, it's just like, wait, why am I playing this?

523
00:39:24,806 --> 00:39:25,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

524
00:39:26,026 --> 00:39:31,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Final Fantasy XII was the first Final Fantasy game to get a perfect 40 for Famitsu Magazine.

525
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,911
[SPEAKER_06]: So some would argue that...

526
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:34,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore

527
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:55,218
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all we've got on Dragon Quest IX for now.

528
00:39:55,278 --> 00:39:57,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we'll come back to it a little later in the show.

529
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:00,061
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to talk about The Conduit, which is a game that came out here in the U.S.

530
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:05,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was supposed to be a really big title over here, but I don't think the game's been selling very well, has it?

531
00:40:05,284 --> 00:40:05,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

532
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:06,765
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's sad.

533
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:08,446
[SPEAKER_06]: What's wrong with The Conduit?

534
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:09,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it not selling well?

535
00:40:10,147 --> 00:40:16,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's more of a mature type of game, and unfortunately there's not a lot of those people on the Wii.

536
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:18,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

537
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:21,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So now maybe Nintendo's marketing is coming back to bite them a little bit.

538
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:24,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, in the scope of things, does it really matter?

539
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:27,759
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it really comes down to Nintendo being retarded.

540
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's retarded in their own benefit.

541
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's why.

542
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:35,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with the GameCube, they were frustrated that the system was viewed as a system for kids.

543
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:42,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And that they couldn't get any good third-party franchises that were more mature to work out for them.

544
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,812
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought, okay, the Wii is going to be different.

545
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:46,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be this all-around system that everyone's going to love.

546
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:51,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Except they had Resident Evil 4, which was one of the best third-party games to come out in the last generation.

547
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:53,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's exceptions to all the rules, but that's not the point.

548
00:40:53,939 --> 00:41:02,425
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is, then the Wii comes out, and instead of, hey, we're going to take what we learned from the GameCube, and we're going to make this better, and we're going to market it to everybody.

549
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:08,749
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're just going to market it to kids now, and casual gamers, and grandmas, and go with that.

550
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:15,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, if you ask me, I don't think they give a crap about third-party, mature-rated games.

551
00:41:16,314 --> 00:41:30,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good genre to have on that system because there's people like me that don't want to go play Mario Tennis or Mario Soccer or Mario Badminton or whatever the hell they're going to come out with next.

552
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:38,274
[SPEAKER_03]: So Conduit, if I had time, once again, it's another game that I have that I just haven't gotten to play yet.

553
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:40,697
[SPEAKER_03]: If I got a chance to play it, then yeah...

554
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:43,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably enjoy it, because I enjoyed Mad World a lot.

555
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:47,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was one of those games that was high voltage studios.

556
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really impressive, the tech demo and everything.

557
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:59,684
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think overall, I mean, it's a good game, but it wasn't like, oh my god, this is better than Metroid, better than everything.

558
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:04,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they've done a lot of things right with it, but at the same time, it's a very generic shooter.

559
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:09,526
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the same cliches that you would see in Halo and pretty much every other sci-fi shooter out there.

560
00:42:09,546 --> 00:42:11,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a really good online...

561
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:22,574
[SPEAKER_06]: J-Rod says Conduit is a very mediocre title.

562
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:26,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only hyped because it's on the Wii, the barren wasteland of third-party games.

563
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:31,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And then FearTheClaw says it's a passable shooter, but not the amazing game it should have been, but not really a bad game.

564
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:36,860
[SPEAKER_06]: J-Rod also continues on to say people also slam Conduit because it wasn't Metroid Prime on the Wii.

565
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,321
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

566
00:42:54,153 --> 00:42:56,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Hacks, by the way, you can also hack it online.

567
00:42:57,294 --> 00:42:59,695
[SPEAKER_06]: The hacker said, everything is virtually unprotected.

568
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:07,897
[SPEAKER_06]: All values can be edited fairly easy, and there's virtually no sign of an attempt at hiding values, fixing bugs, or preventing online hackers.

569
00:43:08,537 --> 00:43:11,338
[SPEAKER_06]: The hacker goes on to say that hacking online is cake.

570
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:17,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, the only difference is in the online mode, the game sends the variables in real time to the server.

571
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently some patch codes actually came out for the game.

572
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:27,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess initially he altered them to actually make the save files corrupt for anybody that used them.

573
00:43:29,428 --> 00:43:35,032
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess he's working with the people that created the game to see who used them.

574
00:43:35,972 --> 00:43:37,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're going to ban them.

575
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:42,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever installed this cheat, they're actually going to ban, which is kind of an interesting end to the story.

576
00:43:42,877 --> 00:43:43,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's an interesting end.

577
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:45,319
[SPEAKER_03]: The story scene is they can't do that.

578
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:47,578
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

579
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:20,700
[SPEAKER_03]: where they leave everything in very well-documented text files on the disc itself and everything is labeled very properly with infinite ammo, check one, toggle this on.

580
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,923
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just ridiculous.

581
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:26,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Rockstar, for doing that because it's awesome to mod your games.

582
00:44:26,826 --> 00:44:30,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look, but if you were playing a modded game online, you're kind of a butt anyway.

583
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:32,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's one thing to do it in private circles.

584
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:33,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's what you do, Loki.

585
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:41,014
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you actually go on Xbox Live and play these, you know, modded for infinite health and all this stuff, you're kind of a butt to begin with.

586
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:41,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

587
00:44:42,394 --> 00:44:46,098
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to hack your personal one-player game, have a ball.

588
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:52,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Or private circle games where everybody has infinite health and everybody has access to the same hacks, then fine.

589
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:55,327
[SPEAKER_06]: That's up to you and your hard-earned money.

590
00:44:55,628 --> 00:45:01,974
[SPEAKER_06]: But going on Xbox Live or going on Nintendo Wi-Fi connection with these hacked games, you're kind of a douche.

591
00:45:02,274 --> 00:45:02,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's face it.

592
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:03,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

593
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:07,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of people, unfortunately, Mario Kart's been kind of ruined by it.

594
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure about Call of Duty or anything like that.

595
00:45:11,603 --> 00:45:14,765
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of the popular Smash Brothers.

596
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:16,507
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people hacking that kind of stuff.

597
00:45:19,492 --> 00:45:19,812
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fucked!

598
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:41,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad.

599
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:45,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't they do something on the server side though that says if this does not equal this then boot user?

600
00:45:45,628 --> 00:45:48,350
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all they're going to be able to do as far as patching the game goes.

601
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:55,174
[SPEAKER_03]: They can only do it on the server end and maybe banning the IPs of those people or something like that.

602
00:45:55,774 --> 00:45:58,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the way to go if they could do that or ban the MAC address.

603
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:08,982
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually what they've been doing is banning the MAC address but once again all people are doing is hex editing the memory to alter their MAC address and boom they're online again.

604
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:09,762
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

605
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, it's bound to happen with every game.

606
00:46:14,882 --> 00:46:17,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, there you go.

607
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:24,730
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's being out there and being hacked, so if you want to hack this game, have fun, but the only thing I would say with that, don't go online.

608
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,851
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to hack, don't go online with it.

609
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:30,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd totally play that game with infinite ammo and stuff like that, because that's just fun.

610
00:46:31,315 --> 00:46:35,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like doing that with Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.

611
00:46:35,678 --> 00:46:38,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that game with infinite health and infinite rockets.

612
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:39,782
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a blast.

613
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:41,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

614
00:46:43,151 --> 00:46:44,472
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

615
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:16,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Like all the lolcats in the universe.

616
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:16,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, sure.

617
00:47:17,484 --> 00:47:20,285
[SPEAKER_06]: We've heard to death about Scribblenauts this game.

618
00:47:20,785 --> 00:47:23,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a bad feeling this is going to turn out like Nintendogs.

619
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:32,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Call me crazy, I have a bad feeling this game is going to go the way of Nintendogs where it's got all this hype pre-release and then when it comes out people are going to be like, okay.

620
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:35,770
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be all into it, into it, into it, and then a month later.

621
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we read all the funny stuff online already.

622
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:40,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know.

623
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:43,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought it was noteworthy that they put out the UK date.

624
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:49,893
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's definitely noteworthy that it's coming to the UK as well, especially when those guys usually get screwed out of releases for a long, long time after we do.

625
00:47:50,654 --> 00:47:53,514
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, again, it doesn't change my opinion on the game.

626
00:47:53,534 --> 00:48:03,598
[SPEAKER_03]: We need that kind of technology with LittleBigPlanet where we can spawn, you know, babies attached to meat and bird lions.

627
00:48:05,098 --> 00:48:06,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they have the suicide babies.

628
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:07,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you try to see if that was there?

629
00:48:08,498 --> 00:48:10,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't given up hope on this game yet.

630
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:12,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there'll be something on Xbox Live or something.

631
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,321
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be kind of cool where you could do that in a big sandbox on Xbox Live.

632
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:17,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

633
00:48:18,082 --> 00:48:20,963
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only so much Scribblenauts talk I can take.

634
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:24,244
[SPEAKER_11]: But also with that, they'd really not be able to...

635
00:48:24,844 --> 00:48:27,026
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to super monitor the online content.

636
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:52,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Work?

637
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:53,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Who wants to do that?

638
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:53,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

639
00:48:53,878 --> 00:48:54,639
[SPEAKER_06]: No one wants to do work.

640
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,883
[SPEAKER_06]: We have someone in chat asking, they didn't change their nickname, so I don't know what their name is, but does anyone know what the game is going to be about?

641
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:04,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a story or what?

642
00:49:04,343 --> 00:49:11,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the story is basically that you are collecting these star pieces, and I'm not really sure why.

643
00:49:12,106 --> 00:49:14,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe to put the stars back in the sky or something like that.

644
00:49:14,607 --> 00:49:15,208
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, cheesy.

645
00:49:15,868 --> 00:49:26,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And then basically you just go through different levels and try to solve the puzzles given, you know... With an entire dictionary of weapons available to you.

646
00:49:26,352 --> 00:49:28,273
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're also, you know...

647
00:49:28,783 --> 00:49:35,694
[SPEAKER_03]: They have pars on each of the levels that you're trying to get the level finished with so many objects spawn or something like that.

648
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,457
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could be interesting.

649
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the level editor will be nice.

650
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,284
[SPEAKER_06]: So Meat Baby will probably not solve every level.

651
00:49:43,186 --> 00:49:43,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try, though.

652
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:45,907
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

653
00:50:12,412 --> 00:50:13,073
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

654
00:50:30,669 --> 00:50:31,910
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

655
00:50:50,762 --> 00:50:51,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see why not.

656
00:50:51,823 --> 00:50:59,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting, though, that they would do this and then still have Last.fm integration with the Xbox and not their own service.

657
00:50:59,529 --> 00:51:03,112
[SPEAKER_06]: That is very strange, unless Microsoft were going to buy Last.fm or something.

658
00:51:03,692 --> 00:51:04,993
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's strange.

659
00:51:06,114 --> 00:51:11,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they also have the Zune music library that they could be integrating with that as well.

660
00:51:11,898 --> 00:51:15,181
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe they're just going to have all these different services all tied together or something like that.

661
00:51:15,669 --> 00:51:17,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so glad we don't have to put up with that anymore.

662
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:38,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of nice, I've got to say, all things considered.

663
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:43,695
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I miss having our own station that we have control of, things have worked out over here.

664
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:47,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely we have Bobby as a lead-in, which has been very cool, and all that.

665
00:51:47,498 --> 00:51:53,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I mean, the move was a good thing, but Live 365, this sounds kind of like that.

666
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:57,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be interesting to see if all the ads are for the ad-free service.

667
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:05,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Very strange that they would have this when Last.fm is coming out as well, unless Last.fm is not going to work the way we want to, or...

668
00:52:06,616 --> 00:52:07,137
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

669
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:25,934
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would sure make sense, of course.

670
00:52:26,234 --> 00:52:26,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

671
00:52:27,275 --> 00:52:28,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

672
00:52:28,676 --> 00:52:29,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we will see.

673
00:52:30,057 --> 00:52:32,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Robocoon in chat says, I've checked up on Life 365.

674
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:33,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, it's gone downhill.

675
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:44,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I did too because I heard some of those, the rates and the fees that kind of pushed us out of there in the first place when they decided to skyrocket the, you know, I understand why they were doing that.

676
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:47,531
[SPEAKER_06]: They were doing that in response to the government increase.

677
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:49,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard some of that got resolved this past week.

678
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:53,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went to Life 365 to see if their rates had dropped for broadcasting.

679
00:52:53,355 --> 00:52:53,496
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

680
00:52:53,556 --> 00:52:53,756
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

681
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:54,956
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

682
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:17,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I get it though.

683
00:53:17,983 --> 00:53:25,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why record labels keep trying to raise the prices of what it's going to cost for these broadcasters to do it.

684
00:53:25,509 --> 00:53:30,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they are putting internet radio out of business, which is too bad because they're biting the hand that feeds them.

685
00:53:30,613 --> 00:53:33,135
[SPEAKER_06]: How do people find new songs, the radio and stuff?

686
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:39,180
[SPEAKER_06]: If radio gets stupid or is just all ad-ridden, people are just going to go listen to the same old shit on their iPods.

687
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,141
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why most people have left radio.

688
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:45,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're doing a dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb thing by demanding these higher rates.

689
00:53:46,815 --> 00:53:48,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid, stupid, stupid.

690
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:49,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I stopped listening to the radio a long time ago.

691
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:52,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I rarely listen to it.

692
00:53:52,064 --> 00:53:54,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I had XM Sirius in my car.

693
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,492
[SPEAKER_06]: My next car, I want to get that.

694
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:57,434
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

695
00:53:58,496 --> 00:53:59,616
[SPEAKER_06]: XNA, but for Rock Band songs.

696
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:33,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently anyone, if you're in an independent band or if you're on a major label, if you want to get your song into Rock Band, you'll be able to essentially take your master versions with this software that's coming out, create your own music files, and then be able to put them in Rock Band.

697
00:54:33,977 --> 00:54:43,979
[SPEAKER_06]: After they go through a service that makes sure that the songs are actually playable and have a reasonable difficulty, in other words, not too easy and not too difficult, and aren't stolen.

698
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:44,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

699
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:51,883
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll all have to go through this kind of peer review service, but you'll be able to charge between 50 cents and $3, and you'll get 30% of whatever the track sales are.

700
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:55,825
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, it's not going to go in the same Rock Band storefront that exists now.

701
00:54:55,885 --> 00:55:01,208
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a separate Rock Band store, but the songs will still load and be playable in Rock Band.

702
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:07,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So very interesting sort of development here, where now anyone can get a song into Rock Band, essentially.

703
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:11,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And Harmonix says to Activision, and that's how you do it!

704
00:55:12,574 --> 00:55:13,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, this is...

705
00:55:14,295 --> 00:55:15,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

706
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,921
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're going to see a lot of content on there now.

707
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:40,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like loads of it.

708
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:42,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be all these bands you've probably never heard of.

709
00:55:42,742 --> 00:55:43,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

710
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:44,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're going to see a lot of crap.

711
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:47,024
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's some people that are really into indie bands.

712
00:55:47,064 --> 00:55:54,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think where this is going to come in really handy is like let's say you have this indie band who's trying to sell CDs that's doing these concerts in local areas.

713
00:55:54,886 --> 00:56:02,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they can say, hey, check out our song on Rock Band and we're going to have flyers at the door that tell you how to get on the store and download our song on Rock Band.

714
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:02,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I think...

715
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:03,950
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

716
00:56:24,867 --> 00:56:30,169
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of map it out via MIDI and stuff, and you decide where you want your frets to go and that kind of stuff.

717
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:36,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can do it with the audio for singing and that kind of stuff as well.

718
00:56:36,332 --> 00:56:41,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, it's going to take a little bit of work, but when you think about it, it doesn't cost them anything to upload their tracks.

719
00:56:42,034 --> 00:56:45,295
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, they're only making 30% off of it, but you know what?

720
00:56:45,315 --> 00:56:46,776
[SPEAKER_03]: 30% for no cost is excellent.

721
00:56:46,796 --> 00:56:48,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's no publishing fees or anything.

722
00:56:54,739 --> 00:57:11,001
[SPEAKER_06]: and Deathwishing in chat is yelling fucking punk I want to see a lot of indie punk and you know what actually and this kind of ties into something Bobby was talking about on his show tonight the Bobby Blackwolf show which is always on before us on All Games Radio at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on AllGames.com on Sunday nights right before we tape

723
00:57:11,502 --> 00:57:13,123
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

724
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:38,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody could upload a music file of a kitten drumming, and as long as it's of a reasonable difficulty, you could put it on the service.

725
00:57:38,343 --> 00:57:39,304
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

726
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:39,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

727
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:43,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see some drum and bass songs in there, like something like Pendulum or something.

728
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:44,548
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.

729
00:57:44,688 --> 00:57:47,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anywhere in the rules say it has to be a particular type of song?

730
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:53,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it does say that you can't have, you know, fuck, shit, cock, piss, you know, as your lyrics.

731
00:57:53,495 --> 00:57:58,659
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you have to still have a family clean version of the song, but there's nothing to prevent you from doing, you know...

732
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,422
[SPEAKER_06]: The Kitten Band with their hit single Meow Meow Meow.

733
00:58:02,582 --> 00:58:06,826
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's nothing to stop you from doing these type of experimental stuff.

734
00:58:07,146 --> 00:58:07,826
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

735
00:58:08,727 --> 00:58:09,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, I think they need that.

736
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:18,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And now everybody in the chat room is yelling out, early green day, tons of ska, and so on and so on.

737
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure, everybody's going to be clamoring for this certain type of thing.

738
00:58:22,017 --> 00:58:25,980
[SPEAKER_06]: But what this opens that up to possibly be a reality, which is kind of cool.

739
00:58:26,361 --> 00:58:27,541
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what also is cool?

740
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,283
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

741
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,183
[SPEAKER_06]: 40 Microsoft points.

742
00:58:48,503 --> 00:58:53,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so, you know, how many of us don't already have 40 points just kind of left over waiting to be spent?

743
00:58:53,807 --> 00:58:57,689
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've ever used the Microsoft Store before, you know, on Xbox Live, you usually have leftover points.

744
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,852
[SPEAKER_06]: It's part of the annoyance of having to buy clusters of points at a time.

745
00:59:01,172 --> 00:59:06,495
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to easily drop the 40 points, just click a button on the computer, and then it'll download next time you power on your Xbox.

746
00:59:06,855 --> 00:59:08,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I do this all the time, by the way, for demos and things.

747
00:59:09,357 --> 00:59:12,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go on to the Xbox Live Store, queue up the things I want to download, and then...

748
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:17,241
[SPEAKER_06]: When I turn on my Xbox, they just come in like magic, which is cool.

749
00:59:20,662 --> 00:59:23,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And some comments in chat.

750
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:28,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says, meaning I don't have to pay $99 for the service unless I want to upload songs.

751
00:59:29,624 --> 00:59:32,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just anybody can upload songs.

752
00:59:32,245 --> 00:59:35,286
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be the copyright owner in order to basically upload the songs.

753
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:38,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other part I should have mentioned, you do have to be...

754
00:59:38,987 --> 00:59:42,029
[SPEAKER_06]: A member of the XNA development community in order to do this.

755
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:44,630
[SPEAKER_06]: But they are really selling this.

756
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:54,195
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have its own little specialized little corner of the marketplace and all this stuff where a rock band developer's community, which I do think it's going to be pretty big.

757
00:59:54,995 --> 01:00:15,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be tough to find the gems you want amongst all the garbage that's about to hit on this but if artists are smart about linking to the Xbox Live Marketplace and making it very easy for you to drop money on their music I think this has the potential to do very well especially for a little tiny artist

758
01:00:15,922 --> 01:00:32,608
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know not necessarily us because we don't have time to put into it but I know there's many websites out there that rate and review all the community games that come out and I'm sure they're going to do the same thing when all these independent well you'll still be able to get the 30 second samples just like you can in regular rock band too

759
01:00:34,574 --> 01:00:38,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can actually listen to the song and I'm sure most artist websites will have it.

760
01:00:38,095 --> 01:00:46,058
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome to make like a 30 second portion of your song really kick ass and then the rest is just banging pots and pans and that's it.

761
01:00:47,279 --> 01:00:56,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you, myself, and DarkSakura should all get a song on Xbox Live Marketplace that is us banging pots and pans together and yelling incoherent lyrics.

762
01:00:56,742 --> 01:00:57,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, we need a ukulele.

763
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Deathwishing says, this is just what the music industry needed, Rob.

764
01:01:00,652 --> 01:01:00,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

765
01:01:28,024 --> 01:01:29,804
[SPEAKER_11]: How about something a little less disastrous, Rob?

766
01:01:29,864 --> 01:01:30,564
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, how about it?

767
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:36,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, Sony's been all, ooh, PSI, it's so cool, it's so cool.

768
01:01:37,446 --> 01:01:54,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, SCEE's head of developer services, Kishi Hirani, was saying that it can actually recognize face and individual feature, that it can, oh, sorry, that it will be able to detect gender

769
01:01:55,190 --> 01:02:00,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Age of Face, different facial features, and tell what your expression is.

770
01:02:02,012 --> 01:02:27,746
[SPEAKER_11]: and we actually did a whole presentation on it and saying that it actually tracks facial movement it's supposed to be part of the motion controller demo so I actually think that that's kind of neat because then like if they do a game that you can map your features onto your character or something you can actually map your animations as well it'd be almost realistic expression

771
01:02:29,485 --> 01:02:34,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope they actually do something with this instead of just releasing the demo and just going, oh, well, that was cool.

772
01:02:35,248 --> 01:02:44,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it because they have those really cool tech demos where, you know, it was like a Lunar and Lander type of game where you actually draw your landscape and then you go play it and stuff.

773
01:02:44,472 --> 01:02:47,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And they showed that wonderful tech demo that was like combat.

774
01:02:47,614 --> 01:02:48,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And did those ever come out?

775
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:52,016
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because they were tech demos and that was it.

776
01:02:52,196 --> 01:02:53,496
[SPEAKER_03]: So, awesome.

777
01:02:53,556 --> 01:02:55,477
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it can detect, you know, faces and stuff.

778
01:02:55,818 --> 01:02:58,559
[SPEAKER_03]: But what the hell are you going to do with it is what I ask.

779
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:01,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I just gave a suggestion of what they could do with it.

780
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than, you know, shine it up and shove it up their ass.

781
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:07,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Or better yet, when the hell are they going to do something with it?

782
01:03:07,883 --> 01:03:12,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the last I checked, Home still doesn't have trophy support in it.

783
01:03:13,685 --> 01:03:13,845
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

784
01:03:13,865 --> 01:03:14,665
[SPEAKER_03]: That was announced what?

785
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:15,446
[SPEAKER_03]: How many years ago?

786
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:20,748
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be kind of neat if your avatar in Home smiled and frowned as you were smiling and frowning sitting there on the couch or whatever.

787
01:03:20,908 --> 01:03:26,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Or your face is just left open agape at the whole hamsters versus humans type thing.

788
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,370
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be kind of cool.

789
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:28,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

790
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,031
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

791
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:53,036
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

792
01:04:14,303 --> 01:04:37,931
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know another thing too remember the mind controller I think it was for an Atari system that it read your facial expression to control the game well what if they did have games that relied on your expression or special type of interface that you would be able to like you know if you blink to move one way or lean your head to the side to go one way you know

793
01:04:38,471 --> 01:04:39,892
[SPEAKER_06]: How about just a goddamn controller?

794
01:04:40,832 --> 01:04:43,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do we have to complicate things?

795
01:04:43,573 --> 01:04:53,676
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just saying that actually would be something if they created a kind of interface in a lot of games that would read motion for people who really can't play games who might enjoy it.

796
01:04:54,893 --> 01:04:56,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so like making it more handicap accessible.

797
01:04:56,835 --> 01:04:57,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

798
01:04:57,415 --> 01:04:58,676
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be kind of neat, actually.

799
01:04:58,796 --> 01:05:08,645
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if it's recognizing the motions of your face, the motions of your head, you could easily lean your head to the side to go one way, lean it to go the other way, lean forward, lean back.

800
01:05:09,266 --> 01:05:15,671
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if it's reading eyebrows or your eyes, you can blink to jump or something or stick out your tongue to...

801
01:05:16,892 --> 01:05:18,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Fart or something, I don't know.

802
01:05:18,393 --> 01:05:18,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

803
01:05:18,893 --> 01:05:19,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Stick out your tongue to fart.

804
01:05:19,913 --> 01:05:20,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, Jamie.

805
01:05:20,714 --> 01:05:22,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thinking of a verb.

806
01:05:23,075 --> 01:05:23,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

807
01:05:23,675 --> 01:05:27,197
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do X with this part to do verb.

808
01:05:28,077 --> 01:05:31,519
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya in chat says maybe that's what Nintendo's heart monitor thingy is for.

809
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:33,660
[SPEAKER_03]: For farting?

810
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,761
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm assuming he's referring to the exercise gaming.

811
01:05:37,422 --> 01:05:37,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

812
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:39,703
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be part of it.

813
01:05:39,783 --> 01:05:44,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure Fit++ will now support that as well.

814
01:05:45,561 --> 01:05:46,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Goody Gumdrops.

815
01:05:47,745 --> 01:05:48,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

816
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:49,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunate.

817
01:05:50,189 --> 01:05:58,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, we'll see what kind of games develop with this new technology, but for now we're going to talk about the games that are coming out right now as we travel the world with some release dates.

818
01:05:59,252 --> 01:06:08,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and we have wonderful games utilizing technology as well, including Sins of a Solar Empire Game of the Year Edition, which is coming out on PC this week.

819
01:06:10,295 --> 01:06:12,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Other fun stuff, GeForce.

820
01:06:12,656 --> 01:06:14,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, maybe that's not fun, but it's a game.

821
01:06:15,217 --> 01:06:24,520
[SPEAKER_03]: GeForce is coming out as well on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, and PSP, based on the animated...

822
01:06:26,138 --> 01:06:45,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Hamster, not Hamster, Guinea Pig, Secret Agent Movie Which, by the way, the PS3 and Xbox 360 are in 3D Rock Band Country Track Pack is coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii this week as well Um...

823
01:06:47,412 --> 01:06:53,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on Xbox 360, we have Watchmen The End is Nigh Parts 1 and 2.

824
01:06:53,515 --> 01:06:57,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And Watchmen The End is Nigh Complete on the PS3.

825
01:06:57,637 --> 01:06:58,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are available as well.

826
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:02,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Little King's Story, which is coming out on the Wii.

827
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:09,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it got nominated for Best Strategy Game out of E3.

828
01:07:09,502 --> 01:07:10,762
[SPEAKER_03]: So that one should be pretty good.

829
01:07:11,363 --> 01:07:12,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming from XSEED.

830
01:07:13,664 --> 01:07:13,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

831
01:07:16,193 --> 01:07:17,634
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not too much else here.

832
01:07:24,237 --> 01:07:34,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, looks like, of course, you know, it's not necessarily during the week, but Wii Sports Resort.

833
01:07:35,641 --> 01:07:37,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that's next week.

834
01:07:37,602 --> 01:07:37,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

835
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:38,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Jumping ahead.

836
01:07:39,483 --> 01:07:39,863
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

837
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:41,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

838
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:42,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

839
01:07:42,365 --> 01:07:43,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely missed this.

840
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:44,187
[SPEAKER_03]: King of Fighters 12.

841
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:45,808
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's a little bit important.

842
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,569
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3.

843
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:53,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And the week from today, Wii Sports Resort with Motion Plus will be available as well.

844
01:07:54,314 --> 01:07:55,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's a big one.

845
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:56,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun.

846
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:01,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well let's travel over to Japan and look at some of the Japanese release dates that are coming up.

847
01:08:01,733 --> 01:08:02,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what?

848
01:08:02,233 --> 01:08:08,498
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Xbox 360, you can finally get the Japanese version of 50 Cent Blood on the Sand comes out in Japan this week.

849
01:08:08,598 --> 01:08:12,660
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you missed out on that gem, you can finally pick that up over there.

850
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:14,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Bethesda is localizing that, I guess, for Japan.

851
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:16,523
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 yen, blood on the sand

852
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:47,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Toro to Morimori Toro continues to chase his dream to become a human after he left the player.

853
01:08:48,186 --> 01:08:53,989
[SPEAKER_06]: One day, Kuro tells the white cat about the memory record, which can grant any wish after you fill it with gratitude.

854
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:54,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So off Toro goes to help people.

855
01:09:09,739 --> 01:09:13,520
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a game that you can check out, I guess, if you want, on the PlayStation 3.

856
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,301
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a very, very Japanese game.

857
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,401
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks kind of cute.

858
01:09:16,441 --> 01:09:17,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to figure out what kind of game it is.

859
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks very kind of adventure-like.

860
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:23,023
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I always thought that cat looked like he was straight out of Animal Crossing.

861
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:29,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, the game... It wasn't that cat based off of doing emoticons and ASCII art?

862
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:29,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be.

863
01:09:30,345 --> 01:09:30,905
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it.

864
01:09:30,925 --> 01:09:32,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it's the cat that was done off of that.

865
01:09:33,866 --> 01:09:35,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it comes with a clock for the PSP as well.

866
01:09:36,886 --> 01:09:37,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to have that.

867
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:39,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I love stuff that comes with stuff.

868
01:09:40,249 --> 01:09:41,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly right.

869
01:09:42,030 --> 01:09:43,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Inside stuff.

870
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:52,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, you know that I bought that whole Cardcaptor Sakura Dreamcast thing because it came with a plate and a fork and a spoon and a pillowcase.

871
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,822
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Nintendo Wii, Punch-Out gets its release in Japan this week.

872
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:59,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually surprised to hear that they didn't have it first.

873
01:09:59,584 --> 01:10:00,385
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of surprised me.

874
01:10:01,186 --> 01:10:04,288
[SPEAKER_06]: But another game that they got that we don't got, Dragon Ball.

875
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:07,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Tekken Ishii Daibouken comes out this week.

876
01:10:08,232 --> 01:10:09,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Tenkaichi Budouken?

877
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:12,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, if you're a big fan of Dragon Ball Z, there you go.

878
01:10:13,317 --> 01:10:14,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Your very own Wii game.

879
01:10:15,362 --> 01:10:16,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy that in Japan this week.

880
01:10:17,423 --> 01:10:18,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to the handhelds for a minute.

881
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, going back to PlayStation 2.

882
01:10:22,567 --> 01:10:24,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Some games get a price reduction this week.

883
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:28,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Musou Orochi get price reductions this week.

884
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, though, to the handhelds.

885
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:34,855
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Nintendo DS, just some accessories.

886
01:10:34,915 --> 01:10:38,197
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like Disney characters, Mickey, Minnie, and Stitch, just some accessories.

887
01:10:38,778 --> 01:10:44,842
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a new game coming out called Caticule Hitman Reborn DS Flame Rumble X.

888
01:10:45,522 --> 01:10:47,765
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fighting game on the DS if you want to check that out.

889
01:10:48,305 --> 01:10:57,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, on the PSP, as I scroll on my list here to get to the PSP, just some price reductions.

890
01:10:57,415 --> 01:11:03,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, Katekyo Hitman Reborn Battle Arena gets a price reduction, and Musou Orochi also gets a price reduction.

891
01:11:03,601 --> 01:11:04,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So, enjoy!

892
01:11:05,704 --> 01:11:07,065
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, your Japanese release dates.

893
01:11:07,085 --> 01:11:07,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move over to Europe.

894
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's actually, again, kind of a slow week like last week was.

895
01:11:12,683 --> 01:11:16,487
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 22nd, we have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time, Reshelled.

896
01:11:17,027 --> 01:11:17,427
Yay!

897
01:11:18,348 --> 01:11:22,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that is one of my favorite turtle games ever.

898
01:11:22,752 --> 01:11:27,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Shatter on the 23rd for PS3 and on the Wii Sports Resort.

899
01:11:27,836 --> 01:11:28,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Try saying that three times fast.

900
01:11:30,799 --> 01:11:31,099
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

901
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Sport Resort.

902
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:32,520
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

903
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,761
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tough.

904
01:11:40,289 --> 01:11:41,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's interesting.

905
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:47,154
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a game that's been out already in Japan, Trash Panic, which is on the PlayStation Network.

906
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:53,359
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting a new version of that game, which is called 100 Yen Gomibaku.

907
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that is, is it's actually a pay-to-play game.

908
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,048
[SPEAKER_03]: PSN Game

909
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:25,081
[SPEAKER_03]: If you complete one of the two modes in that game, it unlocks a bonus in the full version of the game.

910
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:35,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Steel mode will open up the same mode in the original game, and clearing normal mode will also open up five home rewards.

911
01:12:36,303 --> 01:12:41,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of interesting that they're putting out a game that you have to continue to pay to play.

912
01:12:42,924 --> 01:12:43,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

913
01:12:43,444 --> 01:12:44,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't buy it.

914
01:12:46,605 --> 01:12:46,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

915
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:48,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

916
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:05,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose.

917
01:13:06,106 --> 01:13:22,950
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, on Xbox Live Arcade, wouldn't the consumer really like to see, especially with some of these retro arcade releases that you pay $5 for and then play twice, wouldn't it be better to have a token type system where you just pay a quarter to play it once and then see if you want to play it again from there?

918
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:25,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you like it a lot, then you can just buy it.

919
01:13:25,731 --> 01:13:27,731
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because that's what the demos are for.

920
01:13:28,012 --> 01:13:28,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And the demos are free.

921
01:13:29,152 --> 01:13:33,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So why the hell would I pay even a dollar for a game that I can demo for free

922
01:13:34,363 --> 01:13:35,624
[SPEAKER_03]: and realize if I want it or not.

923
01:13:35,884 --> 01:13:36,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

924
01:13:36,485 --> 01:13:46,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my own damn fault if I buy a game that I think I'm going to like and I play it a few times and then just leave it to rot in my game collection as I have before with Doom.

925
01:13:47,322 --> 01:14:01,847
[SPEAKER_03]: and Duke Nukem 3D and Worms and Pac-Man and Dig Dug and all those other goddamn Namco games and other weird obscure Xbox Live Arcade games that I buy because they're cool and then I stop playing them.

926
01:14:02,547 --> 01:14:03,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what?

927
01:14:04,288 --> 01:14:04,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad.

928
01:14:05,348 --> 01:14:11,510
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, if you want to throw away your money like that, I'm sure that Sony will be willing to take it.

929
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony doesn't release demos for all of their games either.

930
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:18,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you feel differently if you didn't have the demos to go off of?

931
01:14:18,727 --> 01:14:23,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would feel differently because that would make me feel like they're trying to rip me off.

932
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:25,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't like being ripped off.

933
01:14:25,655 --> 01:14:26,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a demo for this game.

934
01:14:28,888 --> 01:14:30,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I'm a little bit iffy on it.

935
01:14:30,689 --> 01:14:33,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in some ways, you know, demos can be very limiting sometimes.

936
01:14:33,371 --> 01:14:36,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some of those demos in Xbox Live Marketplace, you play one screen and you're done.

937
01:14:36,814 --> 01:14:43,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I would like a feature where I can play like a couple times to try to get the achievements, but once I've paid out like a dollar, I don't want to try anymore.

938
01:14:43,618 --> 01:14:55,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think it would be kind of cool to have a game that kind of rewards you, you know, that I can kind of pay as you go instead of dropping five, ten dollars on it, and then, you know, I realize this isn't Xbox Live, but I'm making that comparison anyway, whatever.

939
01:14:56,327 --> 01:14:57,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Yaris should pay me.

940
01:14:58,797 --> 01:15:21,330
[SPEAKER_06]: or that, who knows Yara should pay everybody and apologize for its existence no seriously they should pay the consumer because it's an ad and a horrible game mainly the horrible game is why they should have to pay out to everybody BlackWolfInChat says I would say about 90% of my DVD based game collection I don't play anymore either would you consider that a waste of money too?

941
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:27,954
[SPEAKER_03]: no because you don't play it anymore you did play it at a time you don't just buy stuff and not play it

942
01:15:29,213 --> 01:15:30,134
[SPEAKER_03]: and who cares?

943
01:15:31,075 --> 01:15:32,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had those games I've played like once.

944
01:15:33,277 --> 01:15:35,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Fusion Frenzy 2, case in point.

945
01:15:35,759 --> 01:15:38,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I still have a wrapped version of Galarian's Ash.

946
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:39,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

947
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:43,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Played Fusion Frenzy 2 once, said to myself, the fuck was I thinking?

948
01:15:44,246 --> 01:15:45,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And never played it again.

949
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:46,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could have told you that.

950
01:15:47,495 --> 01:15:47,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

951
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:50,697
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanted to play through Galarian's Ash because you made people's heads explode.

952
01:15:50,898 --> 01:15:51,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then you should have played it.

953
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:52,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe I will.

954
01:15:52,699 --> 01:15:53,199
[SPEAKER_11]: I still have it.

955
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have an old PS2.

956
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:56,782
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always go back someday.

957
01:15:56,882 --> 01:15:57,402
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's a thing.

958
01:15:57,422 --> 01:15:59,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have an old PS3, so it'll play it.

959
01:15:59,444 --> 01:16:09,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, nowadays with the internet and everything, I mean, hell, even back in the days where it was just gaming magazines, I mean, you're not completely oblivious to whether a game is good or not.

960
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:10,912
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, you know, sites reviewing them.

961
01:16:10,952 --> 01:16:13,094
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, you know, friends that have played them.

962
01:16:13,214 --> 01:16:14,755
[SPEAKER_03]: You can try demos.

963
01:16:14,895 --> 01:16:15,176
[SPEAKER_03]: You can...

964
01:16:15,876 --> 01:16:41,478
[SPEAKER_03]: you know hear the buzz about it it's just you know I don't think this pricing model unless you're just going to you know put out these games and have no ability to buy them you just you know pay 25 cents or whatever a pop and but even then it's just you know arcade games are meant to take your quarters I know that and you know what I'm not going to play a PC game that's meant to take my quarters that's like playing an Indian casino I mean that's just gonna take my money

965
01:16:42,329 --> 01:16:48,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby goes on in chat, Bobby Blackwolf says, but it's a waste of money to buy an XBLA game that you only played a few times and then not anymore.

966
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:50,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a double standard, just saying.

967
01:16:50,715 --> 01:16:55,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is a waste of money to buy an Xbox Live arcade game that you're going to play a couple times.

968
01:16:55,397 --> 01:16:56,278
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what, though?

969
01:16:56,438 --> 01:16:59,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you think that you got your money's worth out of it, then that's fine.

970
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:07,105
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's take, for example, if you were to play the arcade version of, say, Contra or...

971
01:17:07,927 --> 01:17:09,749
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

972
01:17:26,084 --> 01:17:26,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

973
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,120
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf goes on.

974
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to move on topics, but I'll read this other little debate here.

975
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:50,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so XBLA game that you play a couple of times equals waste of money.

976
01:17:51,227 --> 01:17:57,112
[SPEAKER_06]: DVD based game that you paid probably six times as much and only play a couple of times equals not a waste of money.

977
01:17:59,234 --> 01:18:00,275
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's still a waste of money.

978
01:18:02,327 --> 01:18:08,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I think though, sometimes you go into these games and you look back and you go, wow, I really wasted my money.

979
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,250
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I feel about BitBoy.

980
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:14,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I paid six bucks for that game and I'm like, you know what, this game, that was a waste of money.

981
01:18:14,412 --> 01:18:15,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like Left 4 Dead for me.

982
01:18:16,012 --> 01:18:23,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought the game and I consider it a waste of money because I don't have time to play it and I just don't really want to play it right now.

983
01:18:23,735 --> 01:18:28,658
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, that's just the risk of entertainment sometimes is that you're not always going to be entertained.

984
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:36,702
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, I've gone to a play that I spent 30, 40 bucks on tickets for and was not entertained and was like, well, that was a waste of money.

985
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:40,724
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, it was the Jesus Christ Superstar production here in Sacramento.

986
01:18:40,744 --> 01:18:41,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It was terrible years ago.

987
01:18:42,445 --> 01:18:43,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what else was it?

988
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Movies, all the time.

989
01:18:45,406 --> 01:18:46,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, there's so many movies.

990
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:49,328
[SPEAKER_06]: You pay $10 to go see the movie and then you're like, wow, that was a waste of my time.

991
01:18:49,888 --> 01:18:52,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when movies cost as much as they do.

992
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:56,231
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really tough when you pay that much to see a movie and then it sucks.

993
01:18:57,012 --> 01:18:58,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And then add the food cost into that as well.

994
01:18:58,732 --> 01:18:59,993
[SPEAKER_06]: That can be quite an investment.

995
01:19:00,233 --> 01:19:05,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And I even think you get more of a value out of a video game than you do in a movie.

996
01:19:05,075 --> 01:19:11,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I knew you were going to say that because, oh, an Xbox Live arcade game, you get X number of hours of entertainment out of it.

997
01:19:11,658 --> 01:19:12,038
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

998
01:19:30,311 --> 01:19:35,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And with a movie, if you really, really don't like it, you could probably go back to the front counter and get your money back.

999
01:19:36,114 --> 01:19:37,034
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be surprised.

1000
01:19:37,074 --> 01:19:42,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gone to movies where I let friends or significant others pick the movie, and I didn't like it.

1001
01:19:42,357 --> 01:19:49,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's your fault for trusting someone else's judgment and letting them steer the vehicle, I guess.

1002
01:19:49,941 --> 01:19:54,103
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's like letting my wife pick a movie or something like that sometimes.

1003
01:19:55,055 --> 01:20:22,445
[SPEAKER_06]: and here's the thing is though is that some movies yes you can get more of a value out of like DVDs you know there's some DVDs like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion or Clue I've easily watched those DVDs or Rocky Horror Picture Show shit I've watched those DVDs easily 20 times each you know I would definitely say I got my money's worth out of those just like some video games I probably only spend a little bit of money on like the original Geometry Wars $5 oh my god I spent so much time on that game right or Super Mario Kart back on the old Super Nintendo

1004
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:23,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1005
01:20:43,955 --> 01:20:44,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Risk.

1006
01:20:44,415 --> 01:20:48,017
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at it, it's good for them to try different price models.

1007
01:20:48,297 --> 01:20:51,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bad if they're going to try to force you into those other price models.

1008
01:20:52,939 --> 01:20:59,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Opening options is a good idea, but forcing you down really ridiculous options, that's another thing.

1009
01:20:59,882 --> 01:21:08,606
[SPEAKER_03]: The way I see this game is more of a bonus game that you can play to unlock other stuff in the other game.

1010
01:21:08,966 --> 01:21:12,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like an add-on that you're just paid to play.

1011
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:18,382
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's move on past this topic.

1012
01:21:19,123 --> 01:21:22,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot more to be seen on this topic.

1013
01:21:22,587 --> 01:21:24,870
[SPEAKER_06]: It really depends on how some of these other games do.

1014
01:21:25,871 --> 01:21:29,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be interesting to see the precedent that some of these things might set.

1015
01:21:30,436 --> 01:21:32,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on to another story.

1016
01:21:32,336 --> 01:21:38,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of places you might go to buy games, Microsoft apparently is going to be launching retail stores this fall.

1017
01:21:38,198 --> 01:21:38,658
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1018
01:21:38,998 --> 01:21:40,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the Apple Store in the mall.

1019
01:21:40,538 --> 01:21:41,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what's coming?

1020
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:42,239
[SPEAKER_06]: The Microsoft Store.

1021
01:21:42,519 --> 01:21:44,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the first stores are going to be launching this fall.

1022
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:47,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard where yet, but I guess they're coming.

1023
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:52,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if that means you can actually take your Xbox 360 in there and get it repaired.

1024
01:21:52,521 --> 01:21:53,761
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be kind of cool though, wouldn't it?

1025
01:21:54,341 --> 01:21:55,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Ambitious though, don't you think?

1026
01:21:55,521 --> 01:21:58,122
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I doubt it that you would be able to repair it at the store.

1027
01:21:58,282 --> 01:22:02,023
[SPEAKER_06]: But they are opening up storefronts and just in time for Windows 7, right?

1028
01:22:03,183 --> 01:22:03,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1029
01:22:04,324 --> 01:22:12,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess, let's see, this was confirmed at the Worldwide Partner Conference in New Orleans by the Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Turner.

1030
01:22:13,306 --> 01:22:16,126
[SPEAKER_06]: But they haven't, I still don't see where the first store is going to be.

1031
01:22:16,507 --> 01:22:18,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you though one of them is in Seattle.

1032
01:22:19,698 --> 01:22:20,639
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably a gimme.

1033
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:24,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably Seattle, San Francisco, New York, LA.

1034
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:25,801
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, major cities.

1035
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:27,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, competition's healthy, right?

1036
01:22:28,162 --> 01:22:28,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1037
01:22:28,642 --> 01:22:29,622
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, something else to note.

1038
01:22:29,662 --> 01:22:37,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft had actually hired a former Walmart executive, David Porter, and he's going to be the corporate vice president of these retail stores.

1039
01:22:37,106 --> 01:22:38,766
[SPEAKER_06]: That move was made back in February.

1040
01:22:39,147 --> 01:22:40,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've kind of seen this coming for a long time.

1041
01:22:41,368 --> 01:22:42,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I think these stores could be interesting.

1042
01:22:42,528 --> 01:22:43,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I think competition's healthy.

1043
01:22:44,329 --> 01:22:46,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I think especially, you know, I...

1044
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:53,936
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I do enjoy Apple and I like the iPhone and stuff, I do think some of their shit is obscenely priced.

1045
01:22:54,356 --> 01:23:02,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you get out there in the mall, a laptop that's $400, like the one that I bought at Fry's, although sadly in a Microsoft store at the mall, they're probably not going to go that cheap.

1046
01:23:02,683 --> 01:23:08,689
[SPEAKER_06]: When you get these really cheap laptops next to the Apple laptops, it's going to really drive competition, I think, a little bit.

1047
01:23:09,269 --> 01:23:09,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little.

1048
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:11,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in Apple stores a few times.

1049
01:23:12,032 --> 01:23:12,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

1050
01:23:13,223 --> 01:23:14,323
[SPEAKER_06]: My god, and you didn't melt?

1051
01:23:14,343 --> 01:23:15,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I almost did.

1052
01:23:16,604 --> 01:23:17,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Short exposures.

1053
01:23:18,524 --> 01:23:19,904
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hated being in them.

1054
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:21,465
[SPEAKER_03]: They're blinding.

1055
01:23:22,105 --> 01:23:28,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated being in them because it reminded me of the whole gateway PC stores that they used to have.

1056
01:23:28,266 --> 01:23:32,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you go in and you have to make an appointment to be helped.

1057
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:34,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that's crap.

1058
01:23:34,248 --> 01:23:35,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're so popular.

1059
01:23:36,288 --> 01:23:40,472
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to do that I do If the food's really good, I do

1060
01:23:58,516 --> 01:24:04,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, if they dress the food up really nice, but the food is actually really inferior to cheaper food... Then no, I wouldn't go back to that restaurant.

1061
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:05,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

1062
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:06,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad you see things my way.

1063
01:24:09,019 --> 01:24:10,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, but this is an opinion, not a fact.

1064
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,161
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, you know what, though?

1065
01:24:13,221 --> 01:24:25,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one thing that I do like about the stores, despite your complaint about them, I like the place that there's a place you can take your Apple into to get fixed up, that there's a place where they have these classes that show off how to use the Apple hardware and software.

1066
01:24:25,365 --> 01:24:33,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's kind of neat that it ends up being like a centralized place for Apple, despite the fact that the stores might charge a little more than you might find if you would just shop around.

1067
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:34,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that they blind you...

1068
01:24:35,129 --> 01:24:36,049
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a bad concept.

1069
01:24:36,069 --> 01:24:37,089
[SPEAKER_03]: They really do blind you.

1070
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:39,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, why would you need classes to use an Apple?

1071
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:41,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I thought it was supposed to be user-friendly.

1072
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about, like, not me.

1073
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about older people.

1074
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:46,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Or some of the software that they put out for it.

1075
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:50,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, maybe you've always wanted to use GarageBand, but you're just not sure how to begin, and it's not like you're going to read the manual.

1076
01:24:51,092 --> 01:24:52,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's kind of cool that you could take a class on that.

1077
01:24:53,232 --> 01:24:53,752
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1078
01:24:54,093 --> 01:25:00,734
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're going to make our Pots and Pans song, we're going to need an audio maker to do it, so we might have to use GarageBand, Loki.

1079
01:25:01,174 --> 01:25:01,734
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're not.

1080
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:03,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Adobe makes a really good program already.

1081
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine, fine, fine.

1082
01:25:05,849 --> 01:25:06,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to use it though.

1083
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:07,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Creative Suite 4.

1084
01:25:07,911 --> 01:25:10,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to take a class on it because I don't know how to use it.

1085
01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:11,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I know how to use Adobe Audition.

1086
01:25:12,033 --> 01:25:12,373
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1087
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:16,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, but this is the program that they replaced Audition with and it works just the same.

1088
01:25:17,436 --> 01:25:17,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

1089
01:25:18,037 --> 01:25:18,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1090
01:25:18,317 --> 01:25:21,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we use it to tape our podcast, but that's it.

1091
01:25:22,339 --> 01:25:22,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1092
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:23,780
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1093
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:26,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm curious to see what happens with these retail stores.

1094
01:25:26,302 --> 01:25:28,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I will definitely check them out when they're available.

1095
01:25:28,863 --> 01:25:30,484
[SPEAKER_11]: All this new stuff is getting on my nerves.

1096
01:25:30,905 --> 01:25:31,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that?

1097
01:25:33,474 --> 01:25:35,555
[SPEAKER_11]: My poor brain is living in a cave.

1098
01:25:35,575 --> 01:25:40,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in this economy, though, it's nice to hear about stores opening up as opposed to stores closing.

1099
01:25:41,117 --> 01:25:43,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I sort of have a feeling that it's not going to last.

1100
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:44,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what, though?

1101
01:25:45,419 --> 01:25:49,642
[SPEAKER_03]: A Microsoft store going into a mall, that's one less spot that they can put a Hot Topic.

1102
01:25:51,623 --> 01:25:53,143
[SPEAKER_11]: They can only have one Hot Topic per mall.

1103
01:25:53,163 --> 01:25:53,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a Cinnabon.

1104
01:25:53,503 --> 01:25:54,304
[SPEAKER_11]: They're never going to have...

1105
01:25:55,509 --> 01:25:56,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I like Cinnabon.

1106
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:57,531
[SPEAKER_03]: That's delicious.

1107
01:25:57,571 --> 01:26:01,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know, by the way, at Walmart this week, I was actually at Walmart and I was looking at candles.

1108
01:26:02,255 --> 01:26:04,036
[SPEAKER_06]: They have candles that smell like Cinnabon.

1109
01:26:04,096 --> 01:26:07,099
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a horrible cock tease right there.

1110
01:26:07,459 --> 01:26:09,161
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be real Cinnabon.

1111
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:11,543
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can get the Cinnabon or like the Snickerdoodles.

1112
01:26:11,903 --> 01:26:13,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

1113
01:26:13,445 --> 01:26:17,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, at Cracker Barrel, the last time I was... Which we don't have here.

1114
01:26:18,969 --> 01:26:19,090
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

1115
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:27,534
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a cinnamon monkey bread scented one, which is like super delicious.

1116
01:26:27,574 --> 01:26:28,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Monkey bread's hecka good.

1117
01:26:29,135 --> 01:26:30,255
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get that at the grocery store.

1118
01:26:30,355 --> 01:26:31,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry, food.

1119
01:26:31,316 --> 01:26:32,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Foodio.

1120
01:26:32,497 --> 01:26:34,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move into the classic game of the week.

1121
01:26:34,558 --> 01:26:41,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the part of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane and DarkSakura picks a game that she thinks, you know what, you guys should all be playing this game.

1122
01:26:41,641 --> 01:26:42,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the hell are you not playing this game?

1123
01:26:43,382 --> 01:26:43,923
[SPEAKER_11]: God, really?

1124
01:26:44,003 --> 01:26:50,932
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the classic game of the week, and I believe tonight, in a little bit of a twist, it's the classic games of the week, correct?

1125
01:26:51,232 --> 01:26:51,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1126
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:55,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so DarkSakura, tell us what games we ought to be playing this week.

1127
01:26:57,028 --> 01:27:03,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it really is specifically to one game, but I have to mention the rest of the series.

1128
01:27:04,533 --> 01:27:08,236
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm starting it off with Crush Pinball.

1129
01:27:08,696 --> 01:27:15,460
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually all starts with Alien Crush, which still is probably the better of all of that series.

1130
01:27:17,902 --> 01:27:20,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, there's a little bit of background noise in this particular movie file.

1131
01:27:30,715 --> 01:27:31,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1132
01:27:57,722 --> 01:28:03,430
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can also play two different music tracks and you have a fastball or a slowball.

1133
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:05,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, it's very simple.

1134
01:28:06,153 --> 01:28:07,876
[SPEAKER_11]: The sequel to this was Devil's Crush.

1135
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,817
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like pinball.

1136
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:10,219
[SPEAKER_11]: It is pinball.

1137
01:28:10,279 --> 01:28:13,864
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a, you know, video pinball.

1138
01:28:14,204 --> 01:28:14,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the joke.

1139
01:28:15,065 --> 01:28:15,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, really.

1140
01:28:16,366 --> 01:28:26,453
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is Devil's Crush, or as it was in Japan, Devil Crash, was the next in the series.

1141
01:28:26,633 --> 01:28:31,377
[SPEAKER_11]: It had an occult theme, it had demons and skeletons and everything.

1142
01:28:31,817 --> 01:28:35,340
[SPEAKER_11]: It also is on Virtual Console, as is...

1143
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:41,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as is Alien Crush is also on Virtual Console.

1144
01:28:42,923 --> 01:28:45,765
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mega Drive version was called Dragon's Fury.

1145
01:28:46,705 --> 01:28:48,926
[SPEAKER_11]: And that did get a release.

1146
01:28:49,006 --> 01:28:50,247
[SPEAKER_11]: And it had a sequel.

1147
01:28:50,447 --> 01:28:51,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm playing some Devil's Crush right now.

1148
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:53,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1149
01:28:54,189 --> 01:28:59,251
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mega Drive sequel was Dragon's Revenge, which actually we just found out our cart died.

1150
01:28:59,951 --> 01:29:01,192
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to find another one of it.

1151
01:29:02,012 --> 01:29:03,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought this one had some cool music.

1152
01:29:06,354 --> 01:29:06,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Devil Crush.

1153
01:29:07,395 --> 01:29:10,997
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there was one that we never got in America that I have actually played.

1154
01:29:11,238 --> 01:29:13,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I have played it at somebody's house.

1155
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,842
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not remember when or who, but I know I have played it.

1156
01:29:17,482 --> 01:29:19,424
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's called Jockey Crush.

1157
01:29:20,285 --> 01:29:21,105
[SPEAKER_11]: J-A-K-I.

1158
01:29:21,966 --> 01:29:23,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And it came out on the Super Famicom in 1992.

1159
01:29:24,628 --> 01:29:24,708
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

1160
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:31,274
[SPEAKER_11]: This one has very Super Nintendo music.

1161
01:29:31,334 --> 01:29:43,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to a little.

1162
01:29:44,906 --> 01:29:47,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably too violent for Nintendo standards.

1163
01:29:47,228 --> 01:29:49,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have that kind of demon-y sort of look.

1164
01:29:49,827 --> 01:29:58,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, in the background of the stage, there's actually a type of ogre called a jockey.

1165
01:29:59,657 --> 01:30:04,061
[SPEAKER_11]: So it really is very heavy on the demon theme with this one.

1166
01:30:04,582 --> 01:30:06,224
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's really fun.

1167
01:30:06,364 --> 01:30:08,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually really remember liking this game a lot.

1168
01:30:09,967 --> 01:30:30,926
[SPEAKER_11]: and um it's a little on the difficult side from what I remember but now after that now also by the way I did go looking for this on eBay and it was 54 bucks which I considered um after that though we got a WiiWare version Alien Crush Returns and that one is uh

1169
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:35,168
[SPEAKER_11]: It's me trying not to make noises at the microphone.

1170
01:30:37,229 --> 01:30:45,351
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a somewhat sequel remake to Alien Crush, and it is considered definitely part of the Crush series.

1171
01:30:46,471 --> 01:30:54,893
[SPEAKER_11]: You use the Wiimote with this one, and so you can tilt the table, and you have action balls, which just makes me laugh, all kinds of stuff.

1172
01:30:55,453 --> 01:31:00,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have a six-stage story mode and boss battles and online multiplayer and leaderboards, so...

1173
01:31:01,515 --> 01:31:02,596
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty neat.

1174
01:31:03,537 --> 01:31:04,737
[SPEAKER_06]: This game's kind of freaky.

1175
01:31:05,738 --> 01:31:07,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that one's actually really cool.

1176
01:31:10,661 --> 01:31:21,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, we might want to link the chatroom on this particular video, because this is actually, I think, one of the graphically better Super Nintendo titles.

1177
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:28,953
[SPEAKER_11]: You see how the... I really think it's a fantastic, fantastic game.

1178
01:31:29,553 --> 01:31:30,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I just linked it there in chat, by the way.

1179
01:31:31,901 --> 01:31:57,237
[SPEAKER_11]: but there's there's it really had a lot to do and it's fairly difficult as I recall I've only played it like twice but I do remember playing it all right so yeah it's definitely all about crush pinball and you really people with a Wii you have no excuse not to you know unless you're like dirt poor then why do you have a Wii um but Alien Crush and Devil's Crush you can get on um the Wii you can get um

1180
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:02,181
[SPEAKER_11]: The remake Alien Crush returns on WiiWare.

1181
01:32:02,922 --> 01:32:05,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Jackie Crush emulator.

1182
01:32:06,923 --> 01:32:09,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I really have no problem saying get a SNES emulator and play it.

1183
01:32:09,444 --> 01:32:10,585
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really worthwhile playing.

1184
01:32:11,405 --> 01:32:15,047
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, there's all the Mega Drive versions.

1185
01:32:15,067 --> 01:32:18,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So really, there's multiple ways to play any of the games in the series.

1186
01:32:18,728 --> 01:32:19,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I say go for it.

1187
01:32:20,929 --> 01:32:21,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1188
01:32:21,509 --> 01:32:23,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure Extrofer will agree.

1189
01:32:23,581 --> 01:32:23,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1190
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:25,183
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it, guys.

1191
01:32:25,223 --> 01:32:27,407
[SPEAKER_06]: He played a lot.

1192
01:32:27,447 --> 01:32:29,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day I came home from work, he was playing Alien Crush.

1193
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:32,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even the remake, the old school TurboGrafx one when I downloaded it on the Wii.

1194
01:32:33,255 --> 01:32:33,896
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it, guys.

1195
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:37,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Your classic game of the week is the Crush series, starting off with Alien Crush.

1196
01:32:38,503 --> 01:32:38,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

1197
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:40,839
[SPEAKER_06]: or don't.

1198
01:32:40,919 --> 01:32:41,500
[SPEAKER_06]: See if we care.

1199
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:51,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break with some rapid fire news and some more discussion including our independent developers being shut out of Xbox Live Arcade.

1200
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:53,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Make way for the Avatar Premium clothing.

1201
01:32:53,929 --> 01:32:57,671
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be talking about some of those changes to Xbox Live when we come back from a quick break.

1202
01:32:58,112 --> 01:32:59,973
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1203
01:33:05,404 --> 01:33:05,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1204
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:25,816
[SPEAKER_06]: 9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.

1205
01:33:26,296 --> 01:33:34,660
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked a lot about some of the other gaming news going on in the world in our last section, including news about the Conduit being easy and not selling much.

1206
01:33:35,521 --> 01:33:36,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Being easy to hack, that is.

1207
01:33:37,202 --> 01:33:47,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Talked about the Rock Band Network, talked about Microsoft retail stores, and now we're going to talk about some rapid-fire news so quickly, some stories that we're not going to spend a whole lot of time on but want to get out there anyway.

1208
01:33:47,611 --> 01:33:56,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Fallout 3 PlayStation download content didn't quite come out during June, but now will be coming out by the end of September.

1209
01:33:57,275 --> 01:34:03,717
[SPEAKER_03]: This was an announcement from the PlayStation blog saying that, of course, the content is releasing later than originally expected.

1210
01:34:04,198 --> 01:34:14,302
[SPEAKER_03]: To make up for it, they're going to have the first two download packs will be Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta, which is the brand new actually the last, I think, download content coming to Fallout 3.

1211
01:34:15,602 --> 01:34:19,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, something else coming to the PlayStation Network would be PC Engine games.

1212
01:34:19,726 --> 01:34:22,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they're kind of pulling a little bit of a virtual console there.

1213
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:31,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony has announced that four PC Engine or TurboGrafx-16 titles will be coming to the store actually last week.

1214
01:34:31,878 --> 01:34:38,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And this would include Bomberman 94, New Adventure Island, Sengoku Mahjong, and Devil's Crush, each for 600 yen.

1215
01:34:41,565 --> 01:34:48,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, Sony has trademarked AdHawk Party in the US.

1216
01:34:48,967 --> 01:34:56,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And AdHawk Party was a service originally only available in Japan, and basically it would allow PSP owners to play AdHawk games over the internet.

1217
01:34:56,709 --> 01:35:01,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually AdHawk games, of course, obviously only can play with people in your same room.

1218
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:04,692
[SPEAKER_03]: But now you'll be able to play with your friends over the internet, which is pretty awesome.

1219
01:35:05,392 --> 01:35:05,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, uh...

1220
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:13,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to get it on with the ad hoc gaming with the PSP Grand Theft Auto titles.

1221
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:13,969
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

1222
01:35:14,029 --> 01:35:17,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So any PSP title that has ad hoc play you'll now be able to do on the internet?

1223
01:35:17,851 --> 01:35:18,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1224
01:35:18,191 --> 01:35:18,972
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually kind of good.

1225
01:35:19,032 --> 01:35:20,673
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really good for the PSP.

1226
01:35:20,993 --> 01:35:21,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1227
01:35:21,273 --> 01:35:21,673
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1228
01:35:21,693 --> 01:35:24,074
[SPEAKER_06]: But you'd have to have your PlayStation 3 on while you do it or something?

1229
01:35:24,154 --> 01:35:24,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1230
01:35:24,755 --> 01:35:25,215
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1231
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:26,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that idea.

1232
01:35:27,316 --> 01:35:32,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's go through some more rapid-fire news, including for our music game fans.

1233
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:34,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you're still following Beatmania 2DX.

1234
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:37,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Beatmania 2DX Empress is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.

1235
01:35:37,903 --> 01:35:40,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, it is a Japanese series only.

1236
01:35:40,524 --> 01:35:41,725
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't come out here in America.

1237
01:35:42,085 --> 01:35:44,327
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of our hardcore music game fans, they import them.

1238
01:35:44,347 --> 01:35:48,189
[SPEAKER_06]: But the important news about this, it is the last Beatmania coming to the PlayStation 2.

1239
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:50,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, I'm surprised it is coming to the PlayStation 2.

1240
01:35:51,499 --> 01:35:52,680
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1241
01:36:14,797 --> 01:36:19,001
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, it should be noted, though, this isn't the last game that's coming out in arcades.

1242
01:36:19,321 --> 01:36:28,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Beatmania 2DX 17 Serious, like the satellite radio, not why so serious, but Beatmania 2DX 17 Serious has actually been location testing.

1243
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:29,671
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean like the dog star?

1244
01:36:29,851 --> 01:36:33,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's really where it gets its name from, but probably most people know it as satellite radio.

1245
01:36:33,514 --> 01:36:37,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And not for like, seriously, they're releasing a 17th version of this game?

1246
01:36:37,698 --> 01:36:37,738
No.

1247
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:41,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's interesting though, I hadn't heard of any hardware upgrades.

1248
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:43,993
[SPEAKER_06]: So if this series is coming out to PlayStation 3, I don't know.

1249
01:36:44,434 --> 01:36:45,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what's going to happen in the future.

1250
01:36:45,635 --> 01:36:49,580
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyhow, Beat Media 2DX 16 Empress and Premium Best is going to set you back 7,980 yen.

1251
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,561
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 86 bucks on October 15th in Japan.

1252
01:36:50,581 --> 01:36:52,623
[SPEAKER_06]: So plan on paying about $99 to import it over here probably.

1253
01:36:57,469 --> 01:37:00,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Marvel vs. Capcom is going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.

1254
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:02,031
[SPEAKER_06]: The date was a little bit of a mystery, but now we know.

1255
01:37:02,171 --> 01:37:05,792
[SPEAKER_06]: August 13th and $15 is how much it's going to set you back on the PlayStation 3.

1256
01:37:05,832 --> 01:37:10,194
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a full two weeks, by the way, after the Xbox Live Arcade version.

1257
01:37:11,314 --> 01:37:11,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Sad.

1258
01:37:12,455 --> 01:37:16,977
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, this is also going to be the same date that a retail version of the game comes out.

1259
01:37:17,017 --> 01:37:17,357
[SPEAKER_06]: It's $5 more.

1260
01:37:18,297 --> 01:37:19,418
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1261
01:37:36,696 --> 01:37:39,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, some rewards if you're a Nintendo member.

1262
01:37:39,177 --> 01:37:43,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, we were waiting for some of this stuff from Japan, but now there's some good stuff coming out over here.

1263
01:37:43,479 --> 01:37:49,261
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a Platinum member, you can actually get a downloadable version of Punch-Out called Doc Lewis' Punch-Out.

1264
01:37:49,701 --> 01:37:51,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you want to fight your trainer?

1265
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:54,230
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1266
01:38:17,121 --> 01:38:19,763
[SPEAKER_06]: What you have to do to qualify for each one.

1267
01:38:19,803 --> 01:38:21,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine it just depends on your purchases.

1268
01:38:21,404 --> 01:38:24,046
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just how many coins you get from that.

1269
01:38:24,166 --> 01:38:27,908
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was registering all my Nintendo purchases on Nintendo.com a while ago.

1270
01:38:27,928 --> 01:38:38,514
[SPEAKER_03]: It requires you also to register your purchases, to review the games that you've done, answer little surveys, and then add other surveys available that you could do.

1271
01:38:38,735 --> 01:38:39,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1272
01:38:39,295 --> 01:38:40,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hey, free game.

1273
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:41,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Not going to complain.

1274
01:38:42,077 --> 01:38:43,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if you have to own the original Punch-Out too.

1275
01:38:43,978 --> 01:38:45,079
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a WiiWare game.

1276
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:45,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1277
01:38:46,417 --> 01:38:49,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe I'll check that out, because I never did buy Punch-Out on the Wii, although maybe I ought to.

1278
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:50,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1279
01:38:51,512 --> 01:38:52,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.

1280
01:38:52,234 --> 01:38:54,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Some rapid-fire news from me, Jamie.

1281
01:38:54,921 --> 01:39:09,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Well there's a Swedish group called Opeth that said on their website that they basically said that there's going to be a PSP version of Saints Row because their music is being featured in it.

1282
01:39:10,817 --> 01:39:14,600
[SPEAKER_11]: They're quoted as saying expect it to hit streets around March 2010.

1283
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:17,203
[SPEAKER_11]: THQ hasn't said anything about this.

1284
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:18,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not surprised.

1285
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:23,264
[SPEAKER_03]: They were working on a PSP version of the game, I think, since back to the original Saints Row.

1286
01:39:23,764 --> 01:39:27,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even Saints Row 2, but I know that was coming, so that's awesome.

1287
01:39:28,909 --> 01:39:31,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, guess what's coming back?

1288
01:39:32,031 --> 01:39:32,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's Waldo?

1289
01:39:33,433 --> 01:39:34,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was hoping it was Pet Rocks.

1290
01:39:36,274 --> 01:39:36,634
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1291
01:39:38,756 --> 01:39:40,497
[SPEAKER_11]: There is actually Where's Waldo?

1292
01:39:40,517 --> 01:39:41,638
[SPEAKER_11]: The Fantastic Journey.

1293
01:39:41,718 --> 01:39:46,602
[SPEAKER_11]: So you look for Waldo and his buddies and stuff like it in the books.

1294
01:39:47,123 --> 01:39:52,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And it has four multiplayer mode power-ups.

1295
01:39:54,008 --> 01:39:59,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can actually hide what you're looking for from the other people and different things.

1296
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:01,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's in development for PC, Mac, Wii, and DS.

1297
01:40:02,095 --> 01:40:03,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you get to find Wilma too?

1298
01:40:05,465 --> 01:40:06,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, probably.

1299
01:40:06,146 --> 01:40:07,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can find a bunch of different things.

1300
01:40:08,049 --> 01:40:12,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually seen screenshots for it and it's exactly what you would think.

1301
01:40:13,096 --> 01:40:13,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Waldo?

1302
01:40:13,777 --> 01:40:14,939
[SPEAKER_03]: But a digital version of it.

1303
01:40:15,059 --> 01:40:15,600
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny?

1304
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:18,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually played this game and I'm still looking for a good game.

1305
01:40:19,753 --> 01:40:21,374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's supposed to be coming out in September.

1306
01:40:22,674 --> 01:40:29,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, for some news on Dragon Quest IX, the rumor is that there's going to be some downloadable content.

1307
01:40:30,878 --> 01:40:42,303
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually hinted about from a rumor from NeoGAF that said that it was supposed to be involved in that and that it was going to be big, but...

1308
01:40:43,686 --> 01:40:43,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh well.

1309
01:40:45,707 --> 01:40:51,368
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny is I would definitely think Where's Waldo is going to be the game of September.

1310
01:40:51,908 --> 01:40:55,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw Beatles, Rock Band, Guitar Hero 5, Halo 3 ODST.

1311
01:40:55,909 --> 01:40:58,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so glad they're making a sequel to the Where's Waldo that was on the Super Nintendo.

1312
01:40:58,810 --> 01:40:59,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you ever played this game.

1313
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:01,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking garbage.

1314
01:41:01,551 --> 01:41:03,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the most garbage.

1315
01:41:04,011 --> 01:41:07,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I've played games that were less fun than Where's Waldo, Yaris being one of them.

1316
01:41:07,632 --> 01:41:09,973
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are games that are really bad.

1317
01:41:10,253 --> 01:41:10,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Waldo

1318
01:41:11,713 --> 01:41:14,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to the good adver games?

1319
01:41:16,576 --> 01:41:17,716
[SPEAKER_06]: There were good adver games?

1320
01:41:17,736 --> 01:41:18,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there was.

1321
01:41:18,937 --> 01:41:19,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool Spot.

1322
01:41:19,437 --> 01:41:20,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Cool Spot?

1323
01:41:20,258 --> 01:41:21,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Cool Spot.

1324
01:41:21,218 --> 01:41:22,319
[SPEAKER_03]: That was an awesome game.

1325
01:41:23,059 --> 01:41:24,340
[SPEAKER_03]: You Annoyed was okay.

1326
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,421
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little weird.

1327
01:41:25,441 --> 01:41:27,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they make a game out of McDonald's?

1328
01:41:27,162 --> 01:41:28,563
[SPEAKER_06]: McKids was a game?

1329
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:29,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember that one.

1330
01:41:30,003 --> 01:41:31,224
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a McDonald's game.

1331
01:41:31,384 --> 01:41:32,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, yeah, you said that.

1332
01:41:32,625 --> 01:41:36,767
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a game for... What else was there?

1333
01:41:36,847 --> 01:41:37,147
[SPEAKER_06]: There was...

1334
01:41:38,678 --> 01:41:38,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1335
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:39,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

1336
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:08,571
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh well, let's move on with some more news.

1337
01:42:09,211 --> 01:42:11,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Less advert gaming and more news.

1338
01:42:11,632 --> 01:42:14,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, let's talk about buying stuff.

1339
01:42:15,114 --> 01:42:22,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Microsoft, we kind of knew this was coming with the whole premium content for avatars.

1340
01:42:22,938 --> 01:42:24,499
[SPEAKER_06]: The Cheetos game, thank you.

1341
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:26,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a Cheetos game.

1342
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:27,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1343
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:28,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, yep.

1344
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:30,662
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a Chester the Cheetah game.

1345
01:42:30,962 --> 01:42:33,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It was absolute trash, but it was out there.

1346
01:42:34,093 --> 01:42:34,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1347
01:42:51,377 --> 01:43:19,635
[SPEAKER_03]: including one that they are showing a screenshot for which reveals a steampunk collection and they have different items you can buy for like $2 each and this one made me kind of giggle a little bit it's a steampunk brown jacket and bust and it's funny because she's busty so you know I'm assuming that they're talking about Bustier but I'm just going to leave it at bust so you're actually buying breasts in this as well and that's awesome um

1348
01:43:20,987 --> 01:43:27,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, or as Destructoid calls it, Microsoft Moon Dollars.

1349
01:43:27,589 --> 01:43:28,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.

1350
01:43:28,969 --> 01:43:30,450
[SPEAKER_03]: 160 Microsoft Moon Dollars.

1351
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:33,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a joke because they're not really worth anything, you know?

1352
01:43:33,751 --> 01:43:34,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

1353
01:43:34,631 --> 01:43:38,412
[SPEAKER_06]: You just pay them to the evil empire and then hope that they release something you want.

1354
01:43:38,973 --> 01:43:42,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so basically you're buying more virtual clothing.

1355
01:43:42,235 --> 01:43:44,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's neat, I guess.

1356
01:43:44,436 --> 01:43:48,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, after all, I am a person that bought clothing in-home.

1357
01:43:48,798 --> 01:43:52,499
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be fair, I'm wearing that clothing forever now.

1358
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be forever Santa Claus.

1359
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the way things go.

1360
01:43:58,442 --> 01:43:59,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Loki, you're forever Santa Claus.

1361
01:43:59,983 --> 01:44:00,443
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cute.

1362
01:44:02,104 --> 01:44:06,006
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I just wanted to say in chat, hey, you could do some advert clothes.

1363
01:44:06,146 --> 01:44:06,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1364
01:44:08,072 --> 01:44:09,934
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1365
01:44:20,652 --> 01:44:22,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, they do need to do more of those.

1366
01:44:22,414 --> 01:44:23,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those are really popular too.

1367
01:44:24,777 --> 01:44:25,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think they were.

1368
01:44:26,258 --> 01:44:29,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Weren't they selling at GameStop for more than the $5 they cost originally?

1369
01:44:29,882 --> 01:44:30,062
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1370
01:44:30,863 --> 01:44:31,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they did.

1371
01:44:31,624 --> 01:44:33,046
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're not worth anything now.

1372
01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:35,789
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I just sold some of them back because I wasn't playing them.

1373
01:44:35,809 --> 01:44:36,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you really?

1374
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:39,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have one left that I forgot to sell back.

1375
01:44:40,171 --> 01:44:42,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought all three, and I played them, and I was like, wow, these suck.

1376
01:44:43,333 --> 01:44:45,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think about paying for clothes on Xbox Live?

1377
01:44:46,034 --> 01:44:46,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably won't do it.

1378
01:44:46,914 --> 01:44:54,118
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that's kind of interesting about this, it's not even necessarily, this is basically the reward clothing that you get for certain achievements.

1379
01:44:54,438 --> 01:44:54,959
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

1380
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:56,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like that idea.

1381
01:44:56,399 --> 01:44:57,700
[SPEAKER_03]: This I'm not even interested in.

1382
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:06,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I have never changed, you know, maybe a couple times changed clothes on my avatar, but I'm kind of happy with what they are now.

1383
01:45:06,504 --> 01:45:07,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really give a shit.

1384
01:45:08,426 --> 01:45:12,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to go in there and update my avatar, and I didn't really see a lot of new stuff that I wanted to wear.

1385
01:45:12,668 --> 01:45:17,792
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of it's really out there, and I like my avatar to kind of look like me, although it really looks nothing like me.

1386
01:45:18,292 --> 01:45:20,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to make it at least kind of close.

1387
01:45:20,193 --> 01:45:22,375
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura looks a lot like her, actually.

1388
01:45:22,415 --> 01:45:23,175
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of freaky.

1389
01:45:24,156 --> 01:45:24,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan looks like him.

1390
01:45:25,137 --> 01:45:26,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's doesn't really look like him, either.

1391
01:45:27,838 --> 01:45:29,159
[SPEAKER_11]: It's as close as I could get.

1392
01:45:29,299 --> 01:45:32,982
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it look like you have a lot more facial hair than you actually do.

1393
01:45:33,602 --> 01:45:33,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1394
01:45:33,902 --> 01:45:35,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the weird thing about it.

1395
01:45:35,343 --> 01:45:36,124
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of looks like it.

1396
01:45:36,144 --> 01:45:36,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It's darker.

1397
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:37,805
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no in-between.

1398
01:45:37,825 --> 01:45:38,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.

1399
01:45:38,826 --> 01:45:39,547
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem with it.

1400
01:45:40,968 --> 01:45:41,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, yeah.

1401
01:45:43,089 --> 01:45:45,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm cool with the reward clothes, but I wouldn't pay money for clothes.

1402
01:45:45,792 --> 01:45:47,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what do you really use the avatars for?

1403
01:45:48,474 --> 01:45:48,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

1404
01:45:48,974 --> 01:45:52,677
[SPEAKER_06]: On your card, your gamer card, maybe you see it in 1 versus 100.

1405
01:45:52,837 --> 01:45:54,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not that big a deal.

1406
01:45:54,999 --> 01:45:58,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess there's some games, a few games that use them, but not really.

1407
01:45:58,882 --> 01:45:59,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And who cares?

1408
01:45:59,742 --> 01:46:03,105
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to go, oh my god, your avatar is poorly dressed.

1409
01:46:04,008 --> 01:46:07,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, SSJ100Matt says, Rangers jersey, please.

1410
01:46:07,869 --> 01:46:09,090
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually kind of a good point.

1411
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:11,211
[SPEAKER_06]: What about these, like, sports jersey tie-ins?

1412
01:46:11,251 --> 01:46:13,812
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be kind of cool, like, to wear your favorite team.

1413
01:46:14,112 --> 01:46:16,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like a lot of people actually do wear that stuff, right?

1414
01:46:17,193 --> 01:46:17,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good for them.

1415
01:46:19,074 --> 01:46:19,894
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not buying it.

1416
01:46:21,174 --> 01:46:22,135
[SPEAKER_03]: The steampunk clothing?

1417
01:46:22,635 --> 01:46:24,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, my character does not need a bust.

1418
01:46:26,496 --> 01:46:27,557
[SPEAKER_03]: No bust for my character.

1419
01:46:28,843 --> 01:46:30,684
[SPEAKER_06]: No bust for you.

1420
01:46:31,505 --> 01:46:32,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to some more news.

1421
01:46:32,525 --> 01:46:39,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of Xbox Live Arcade, apparently there's some mumbling going around that indie games are being closed out of Xbox Live Arcade.

1422
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:44,472
[SPEAKER_06]: This came from a report from Screenplay talking to some concerned developers.

1423
01:46:44,812 --> 01:46:49,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently Microsoft has been dramatically reducing the number of independent titles published on Xbox Live Arcade.

1424
01:46:50,396 --> 01:46:57,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the whole crackdown on independent games is a response to folks saying that there is just too much available on the service.

1425
01:46:57,740 --> 01:47:05,272
[SPEAKER_06]: The major publishers are actually behind this saying that, well, you aren't giving enough attention to our major games because you're spending time promoting these indie games.

1426
01:47:06,033 --> 01:47:13,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Indie developers also a little sad because they think there are two different sets of rules for publishers, one being for indies and one being for major publishers.

1427
01:47:13,644 --> 01:47:16,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft has responded to the accusations.

1428
01:47:16,546 --> 01:47:18,467
[SPEAKER_06]: It took them a little while, but they did respond and say,

1429
01:47:34,537 --> 01:47:34,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1430
01:47:55,023 --> 01:48:10,921
[SPEAKER_03]: and honestly I see the point where they're kind of being shut up but at the same time if they market themselves right they could actually release a game through community games and it could be the same quality I mean there's some really good games on there the problem is there's a lot of really crappy games on there as well and it kind of gets buried in all that

1431
01:48:11,341 --> 01:48:18,726
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we mentioned, Part A, now you can link to your downloads and stuff like that and your blogs.

1432
01:48:19,046 --> 01:48:25,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of ways they can market themselves, but I think they want Microsoft to kind of do the marketing for them.

1433
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:30,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they should if Microsoft's getting so much money from it.

1434
01:48:30,953 --> 01:48:35,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, it's not like they're completely being blocked out of it.

1435
01:48:35,916 --> 01:48:38,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it's not an Xbox Live Arcade doesn't mean it can't be up on their service.

1436
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:43,319
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I do think Microsoft is a little bit in the right here.

1437
01:48:43,579 --> 01:48:49,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly they're doing more than Nintendo or Sony's doing, although it does seem Nintendo does get a lot of indie games on it.

1438
01:48:50,464 --> 01:48:55,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, they get a lot of indie games on it, but is Nintendo actually promoting those indie games?

1439
01:48:55,348 --> 01:48:57,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really the indie games that are promoting themselves on there.

1440
01:48:57,830 --> 01:48:58,190
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1441
01:48:58,290 --> 01:48:58,850
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very true.

1442
01:48:59,411 --> 01:49:00,632
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you hear about any of those games?

1443
01:49:00,652 --> 01:49:01,032
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't.

1444
01:49:01,052 --> 01:49:01,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Through the blog.

1445
01:49:01,752 --> 01:49:04,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo doesn't do a lot to sell those games, besides just put them on the marketplace.

1446
01:49:05,175 --> 01:49:09,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Or send out the email, here's what's up on the virtual console WiiWare.

1447
01:49:09,318 --> 01:49:09,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

1448
01:49:11,161 --> 01:49:12,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think to some extent, Microsoft's in the right there.

1449
01:49:12,982 --> 01:49:22,168
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, what about... I thought there were supposed to be the really big, great indie games would cross over into being full-blown Xbox Live arcade games.

1450
01:49:22,228 --> 01:49:23,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever happened to that?

1451
01:49:23,749 --> 01:49:25,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you still can't get achievements out of indie games.

1452
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:26,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are.

1453
01:49:27,031 --> 01:49:28,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like... What?

1454
01:49:29,132 --> 01:49:29,773
[SPEAKER_06]: What's crossed over?

1455
01:49:30,713 --> 01:49:34,536
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dishwasher, that one crossed over.

1456
01:49:34,976 --> 01:49:35,716
[SPEAKER_03]: There was...

1457
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:41,584
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one that was like winner of that GameCon thing.

1458
01:49:41,824 --> 01:49:42,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

1459
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a couple that have crossed over.

1460
01:49:44,225 --> 01:49:46,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, The Age's Wing that was free?

1461
01:49:46,686 --> 01:49:47,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that one?

1462
01:49:47,547 --> 01:49:48,207
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not that one.

1463
01:49:48,227 --> 01:49:49,307
[SPEAKER_06]: That was before XNA.

1464
01:49:49,407 --> 01:49:50,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was something else.

1465
01:49:51,008 --> 01:49:52,049
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some other ones that won.

1466
01:49:52,409 --> 01:49:55,530
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know the community games, there's a few that actually get spotlighted.

1467
01:49:56,491 --> 01:49:58,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Carnyvale Showtime or whatever.

1468
01:49:58,752 --> 01:50:00,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that one I was talking about a long time ago?

1469
01:50:01,853 --> 01:50:03,714
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually being shown off at PAX now.

1470
01:50:03,854 --> 01:50:05,155
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little indie games thing.

1471
01:50:05,215 --> 01:50:05,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1472
01:50:06,115 --> 01:50:07,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're promoted very well.

1473
01:50:07,376 --> 01:50:07,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1474
01:50:30,546 --> 01:50:34,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, they are doing, I think, more to promote them than other places.

1475
01:50:35,408 --> 01:50:37,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know if Sony is promoting them.

1476
01:50:37,469 --> 01:50:39,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hell, they don't really have that many indie games.

1477
01:50:39,290 --> 01:50:45,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they do have some indie games on their PlayStation Network service, but it's not like you're getting a flood of games coming out from them.

1478
01:50:45,453 --> 01:50:49,195
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one or two a week, maybe, if you're getting a release every week.

1479
01:50:50,083 --> 01:50:52,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whereas there's hundreds of community games.

1480
01:51:11,597 --> 01:51:15,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe some of this should be developed as disc games or a step further.

1481
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:18,281
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess at the same time, that's expensive.

1482
01:51:18,681 --> 01:51:19,522
[SPEAKER_06]: How indie is that?

1483
01:51:20,563 --> 01:51:24,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not do collections?

1484
01:51:24,685 --> 01:51:25,946
[SPEAKER_11]: The monthly pick or something.

1485
01:51:26,286 --> 01:51:26,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be.

1486
01:51:27,987 --> 01:51:28,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's unfortunate.

1487
01:51:46,621 --> 01:51:49,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess in the next thing, X-Link says a vote system.

1488
01:51:49,462 --> 01:51:53,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's what's coming in the next version of Xbox Live, the dashboard.

1489
01:51:53,643 --> 01:51:59,346
[SPEAKER_06]: They've talked about that they're going to have voting on not only the community games, but the regular games too, which should be interesting.

1490
01:51:59,426 --> 01:52:02,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I don't know, I think those voting systems can be abused.

1491
01:52:03,687 --> 01:52:06,488
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if it's like Dig, it can be abused.

1492
01:52:06,928 --> 01:52:10,189
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just who's the most popularist, right?

1493
01:52:10,549 --> 01:52:10,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1494
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:11,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1495
01:52:13,733 --> 01:52:17,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Fear the Claw, though, says this, the point of being indie is to find mythical treasures.

1496
01:52:17,398 --> 01:52:20,001
[SPEAKER_06]: The point of being indie is to get yourself out there.

1497
01:52:20,802 --> 01:52:21,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Play on the word indie.

1498
01:52:22,024 --> 01:52:25,087
[SPEAKER_06]: But I get what he's saying, is that getting yourself out there is a big part of it.

1499
01:52:26,629 --> 01:52:28,091
[SPEAKER_06]: To be continued, I'm sure.

1500
01:52:28,511 --> 01:52:30,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, our show is to be continued, right, DarkSakura?

1501
01:52:30,934 --> 01:52:31,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, absolutely.

1502
01:52:31,835 --> 01:52:34,419
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have a little bit more in the way of news.

1503
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:35,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's not really news.

1504
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:40,346
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that we all knew and have been saying and they finally admitted.

1505
01:52:42,168 --> 01:52:47,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Ryota Nitsuma, who is the assistant producer on the arcade version of Street Fighter IV...

1506
01:52:48,375 --> 01:53:02,618
[SPEAKER_11]: said that there are two fighters who were disproportionately powerful and he actually, to quote him, says well first of all I might have to apologize, does he involve being slightly blinded and scarred?

1507
01:53:03,078 --> 01:53:12,860
[SPEAKER_11]: And so actually he said that Seth and perhaps Sagat are two overpowered characters in the game but a skilled player can still beat them.

1508
01:53:13,789 --> 01:53:15,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't call them overpowered other than cheap.

1509
01:53:18,192 --> 01:53:20,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheap I think goes with the overpowered thing.

1510
01:53:21,515 --> 01:53:23,076
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more that they are...

1511
01:53:24,648 --> 01:53:52,218
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say just for skill level that it would require a higher amount of skill level than it would to fight any of the other characters the final boss should be hard but I agree he's way too freaking hard Seth is a cheap ass mofo he's way too hard I think also the boss in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom oh my god cheap the fucking happy fun ball yeah I agree with that

1512
01:53:54,389 --> 01:53:58,451
[SPEAKER_03]: End of the fight three times, which makes it three times as awesome.

1513
01:53:59,171 --> 01:54:01,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Or frustrating, however you want to look at that.

1514
01:54:01,232 --> 01:54:02,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting, though, that they've come out and admit it.

1515
01:54:02,973 --> 01:54:05,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, a lot of times people are like, no, my game is perfect.

1516
01:54:05,494 --> 01:54:06,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing's wrong with it.

1517
01:54:06,414 --> 01:54:07,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got fucked up.

1518
01:54:08,695 --> 01:54:08,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Dope.

1519
01:54:09,316 --> 01:54:11,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fix it, then.

1520
01:54:11,977 --> 01:54:14,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Put out a patch for the home versions.

1521
01:54:14,278 --> 01:54:16,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you've got some of them online.

1522
01:54:16,619 --> 01:54:16,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it.

1523
01:54:17,899 --> 01:54:19,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, but that means you've got to do work.

1524
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:20,621
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1525
01:54:21,381 --> 01:54:22,942
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already sold a jillion copies.

1526
01:54:23,002 --> 01:54:23,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should we bother?

1527
01:54:25,697 --> 01:54:25,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1528
01:54:27,218 --> 01:54:27,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

1529
01:54:27,738 --> 01:54:35,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to quote DarkTetsuya saying that hopefully the Happy Fun Ball is toned down a bit for the US version.

1530
01:54:35,063 --> 01:54:37,345
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do agree with SSG100.

1531
01:54:37,585 --> 01:54:39,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt Gill is still a big bitch.

1532
01:54:42,452 --> 01:54:43,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on.

1533
01:54:44,614 --> 01:54:50,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So, kind of interesting, there's now a rumor, or not really a rumor, I guess it's an internal memo.

1534
01:54:51,581 --> 01:54:58,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Canadian retailer Zellers has put out a memo, apparently, internally in their store chain.

1535
01:54:58,787 --> 01:55:02,728
[SPEAKER_03]: That they're going to be no longer stocking the 80GB PS3 core bundles.

1536
01:55:03,448 --> 01:55:05,248
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be of course the system by itself.

1537
01:55:05,968 --> 01:55:17,011
[SPEAKER_03]: It says basically that they are not to take rain checks on an advertising deal allowing customers to purchase an 80GB core bundle with any PS3 game under $30 for $380 after a $20 discount.

1538
01:55:17,031 --> 01:55:17,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming that's $380 Canadian.

1539
01:55:24,819 --> 01:55:34,127
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently Ranma also says that the rain checks can't be accepted because the company cannot promise to fill them with the same item.

1540
01:55:34,808 --> 01:55:41,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically saying more or less that they're not going to be available and that they're phasing them out.

1541
01:55:43,072 --> 01:55:46,434
[SPEAKER_06]: and basically a big neon sign that says the PS3 Slim is true.

1542
01:55:46,614 --> 01:55:49,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So shut up with these rumors story.

1543
01:55:49,536 --> 01:55:52,737
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I don't want any more stories about the PS3 Slim being a rumor.

1544
01:55:53,098 --> 01:55:53,798
[SPEAKER_06]: It's confirmed.

1545
01:55:53,938 --> 01:55:55,619
[SPEAKER_06]: If this doesn't confirm it, I don't know what does.

1546
01:55:55,779 --> 01:55:57,700
[SPEAKER_06]: It is true.

1547
01:55:59,401 --> 01:55:59,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happening.

1548
01:56:00,982 --> 01:56:02,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's happening.

1549
01:56:03,603 --> 01:56:04,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's happening.

1550
01:56:05,304 --> 01:56:08,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to hear this nonsense about a rumored PS3 Slim.

1551
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:08,566
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happening.

1552
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:11,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a matter of Sony to reveal date and price.

1553
01:56:11,288 --> 01:56:11,648
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1554
01:56:13,339 --> 01:56:13,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you do.

1555
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:22,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this is one of the stories, but for the Games Conference in, I think it's in Germany, wherever, Europe.

1556
01:56:22,865 --> 01:56:23,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Leipzig?

1557
01:56:24,146 --> 01:56:24,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore.

1558
01:56:24,827 --> 01:56:25,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's somewhere else.

1559
01:56:25,487 --> 01:56:26,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

1560
01:56:26,828 --> 01:56:27,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Games Conference.

1561
01:56:28,729 --> 01:56:35,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony has booked three hours for talking, you know, their keynote or whatever that's going to be there.

1562
01:56:37,415 --> 01:56:39,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Could maybe this be something that they're talking about?

1563
01:56:39,316 --> 01:56:39,657
[SPEAKER_03]: You think?

1564
01:56:39,677 --> 01:56:40,477
[SPEAKER_03]: PS3 Slam?

1565
01:56:41,098 --> 01:56:41,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

1566
01:56:41,983 --> 01:56:45,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not take it to a country that's received the PlayStation a little better than the U.S.?

1567
01:56:45,404 --> 01:56:46,865
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why we didn't hear about it at E3.

1568
01:56:46,885 --> 01:56:48,125
[SPEAKER_06]: They're waiting to announce it for Europe.

1569
01:56:50,066 --> 01:56:50,666
[SPEAKER_03]: At the price point of $800.

1570
01:56:52,707 --> 01:56:53,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope not.

1571
01:56:54,167 --> 01:56:54,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't get it.

1572
01:56:55,988 --> 01:56:57,248
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be just... Oh, God.

1573
01:56:57,488 --> 01:56:59,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet something stupid like that does happen.

1574
01:57:00,289 --> 01:57:01,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

1575
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:06,472
[SPEAKER_03]: The PS3 Slim is coming out like the sun rises every day, okay?

1576
01:57:06,732 --> 01:57:06,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

1577
01:57:08,058 --> 01:57:08,798
[SPEAKER_03]: without fail.

1578
01:57:09,318 --> 01:57:15,439
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we've learned anything from Sony rumor stories, it's that most of the time they come true.

1579
01:57:15,459 --> 01:57:17,600
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

1580
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:19,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you hear them over and over and over again.

1581
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:19,520
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.

1582
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:21,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if this isn't confirmation, what is?

1583
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:29,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Gee, we have to get rid of the 80 gigabyte bundles because we're not going to be getting any more in and we can't ever guarantee that we're going to be able to replace them because they're just not being made anymore.

1584
01:57:29,082 --> 01:57:29,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder why.

1585
01:57:30,482 --> 01:57:35,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't we say a couple weeks ago on this show, Sony's going to start clearing stuff out when it's time to get a new bundle out there.

1586
01:57:35,923 --> 01:57:37,163
[SPEAKER_06]: When is the Euro Game Conference?

1587
01:57:38,506 --> 01:57:39,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Bookworm

1588
01:57:59,775 --> 01:58:01,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Bookworm Adventures is kind of neat.

1589
01:58:01,336 --> 01:58:05,497
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a role-playing game meets Boggle, I guess is the best way I could describe it.

1590
01:58:05,537 --> 01:58:15,361
[SPEAKER_06]: You make these words out of a Boggle-style board, and depending on how long you make the words and what kind of special gems and things you use in the words, you attack monsters that approach you.

1591
01:58:15,441 --> 01:58:19,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a little bit role-playing-ish, although I wouldn't say there's a world map or anything like that.

1592
01:58:19,783 --> 01:58:21,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Why hasn't this come to the DS yet?

1593
01:58:21,904 --> 01:58:24,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually kind of surprised we haven't really seen this anywhere but the PC.

1594
01:58:25,555 --> 01:58:25,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Nowhere.

1595
01:58:25,895 --> 01:58:27,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't seen it on Xbox Live.

1596
01:58:27,636 --> 01:58:28,656
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't seen it on Facebook.

1597
01:58:28,676 --> 01:58:29,376
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't seen it anywhere.

1598
01:58:30,016 --> 01:58:30,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

1599
01:58:31,377 --> 01:58:33,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's going to be released on July 30th.

1600
01:58:33,337 --> 01:58:35,758
[SPEAKER_06]: $19.99 is how much it's going to set you back.

1601
01:58:36,638 --> 01:58:37,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So there it is.

1602
01:58:37,418 --> 01:58:40,059
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a free trial available on PopCap.com.

1603
01:58:41,179 --> 01:58:43,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, if you haven't played the original, it's fun.

1604
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:50,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And they haven't said exactly what's new about the sequel, but I'm imagining more items, more monsters, more special things.

1605
01:58:51,442 --> 01:58:52,102
[SPEAKER_06]: More of the same.

1606
01:58:53,368 --> 01:58:54,788
[SPEAKER_06]: But new and improved at the same time.

1607
01:58:55,669 --> 01:58:57,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what's coming to Bookworm Adventures 2.

1608
01:58:58,049 --> 01:59:00,410
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be fun.

1609
01:59:00,570 --> 01:59:04,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get our very own Bookworm DarkSakura to jump into the mailbag and do some reading.

1610
01:59:04,911 --> 01:59:05,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I gotta?

1611
01:59:05,632 --> 01:59:06,012
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta.

1612
01:59:06,072 --> 01:59:09,333
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our mailbag section we do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1613
01:59:10,713 --> 01:59:14,054
[SPEAKER_06]: When you send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

1614
01:59:16,997 --> 01:59:21,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the first email of the day is really short, and I really don't get it, but I'm going to read it anyway.

1615
01:59:21,663 --> 01:59:22,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Sent to us by Juan.

1616
01:59:23,625 --> 01:59:25,107
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hot here in California, right?

1617
01:59:25,127 --> 01:59:25,707
[SPEAKER_11]: 108 in LA.

1618
01:59:25,868 --> 01:59:26,709
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a spam.

1619
01:59:27,309 --> 01:59:27,650
[SPEAKER_06]: It is?

1620
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:28,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1621
01:59:28,811 --> 01:59:29,892
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn that spam.

1622
01:59:31,089 --> 01:59:33,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just figured because we were talking about the heat earlier and it was the last one to arrive.

1623
01:59:34,091 --> 01:59:35,312
[SPEAKER_06]: It's convenient spam.

1624
01:59:35,772 --> 01:59:36,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1625
01:59:36,953 --> 01:59:37,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well then whatever.

1626
01:59:37,733 --> 01:59:38,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you.

1627
01:59:39,494 --> 01:59:40,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe it wasn't spam.

1628
01:59:40,975 --> 01:59:44,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll feel bad if it is, but usually those very short emails and stuff.

1629
01:59:44,577 --> 01:59:46,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there an attachment that's an HTML file?

1630
01:59:46,919 --> 01:59:47,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't notice.

1631
01:59:47,579 --> 01:59:48,820
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably spam if it is.

1632
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:50,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to the listener if it's not.

1633
01:59:50,381 --> 01:59:51,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there was an attachment.

1634
01:59:51,862 --> 01:59:57,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, if you want us to know that you're not spam, put OLR or Orange Lounge Radio or something in the title.

1635
01:59:57,446 --> 01:59:57,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll know.

1636
01:59:58,246 --> 01:59:58,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Please do.

1637
02:00:00,627 --> 02:00:01,988
[SPEAKER_11]: This one comes from Deathwishing.

1638
02:00:02,448 --> 02:00:07,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you guys talked about MechWarrior, and I was wondering if you had heard of the BattleMech Firestorm Telsa pods.

1639
02:00:07,971 --> 02:00:08,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we have.

1640
02:00:09,291 --> 02:00:12,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, it's MechWarrior 4 put into a huge cabinet to simulate being in the mech.

1641
02:00:13,133 --> 02:00:14,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Simply badass.

1642
02:00:14,814 --> 02:00:16,715
[SPEAKER_11]: They are rare, though, and mostly at conventions.

1643
02:00:17,015 --> 02:00:18,476
[SPEAKER_11]: You should buy one for the studio.

1644
02:00:18,676 --> 02:00:20,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, okay.

1645
02:00:20,277 --> 02:00:21,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I got that money in my butt right here.

1646
02:00:21,757 --> 02:00:26,580
[SPEAKER_11]: We had BattleMech at Dave & Buster's in Milpitas, and they took it out.

1647
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:28,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1648
02:00:48,314 --> 02:00:56,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, also, the next email comes from... Well, I just want to say, though, it's still not the same as the real mechs we were talking about last episode.

1649
02:00:56,281 --> 02:00:58,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a real mech battle arena.

1650
02:00:58,523 --> 02:00:58,643
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1651
02:00:59,143 --> 02:00:59,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Robot Jocks.

1652
02:01:00,564 --> 02:01:04,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Found my screener for Robot Jocks on VHS.

1653
02:01:04,728 --> 02:01:06,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Deathwishing in chat says, why would they take it out?

1654
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:09,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because I guess it was expensive.

1655
02:01:09,372 --> 02:01:11,554
[SPEAKER_11]: It was expensive, but not enough people were playing it.

1656
02:01:11,714 --> 02:01:13,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's expensive and takes up a lot of space.

1657
02:01:14,116 --> 02:01:15,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I play that when I can play skee-ball.

1658
02:01:17,443 --> 02:01:22,306
[SPEAKER_11]: This one comes from... You didn't actually sign it, so I'm just going to say Tranman.

1659
02:01:22,326 --> 02:01:25,268
[SPEAKER_11]: No, from Loomies, sorry.

1660
02:01:26,809 --> 02:01:35,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Long-time listener, first-time emailer, do y'all think we will see less third-party games on PSP with the latest NPD results?

1661
02:01:35,755 --> 02:01:41,279
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to sell a decent amount of hardware monthly, but the software isn't anywhere near the top 10.

1662
02:01:41,639 --> 02:01:46,983
[SPEAKER_11]: It's disappointing to see a game like Rock Band Unplugged sell only 35,000 units, considering the quality of it.

1663
02:01:47,583 --> 02:01:51,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for taking my email and I hope to have the courage to call in.

1664
02:01:51,464 --> 02:01:53,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Sky, please upload the podcast sooner.

1665
02:01:53,445 --> 02:01:56,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Best wishes to Loki on the Twins and hi, DarkSakura.

1666
02:01:56,946 --> 02:01:57,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi!

1667
02:01:59,347 --> 02:01:59,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try.

1668
02:01:59,827 --> 02:02:01,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really sorry about last week.

1669
02:02:01,248 --> 02:02:02,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I explained it earlier in the show, though.

1670
02:02:04,702 --> 02:02:07,964
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as third-party games on the PSP, yeah, they keep selling like crap.

1671
02:02:08,024 --> 02:02:10,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, again, what's being done to promote these games?

1672
02:02:10,986 --> 02:02:12,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a whole lot of great buzz out there.

1673
02:02:12,808 --> 02:02:16,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, to be fair, Rock Band Unplugged had probably better buzz than most games out there.

1674
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:19,952
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is kind of sad the game itself didn't do better.

1675
02:02:20,053 --> 02:02:26,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But the PSP has just not, I think, penetrated the greater marketplace as the must-have handheld system for gaming.

1676
02:02:26,817 --> 02:02:28,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's niche as college kids.

1677
02:02:29,219 --> 02:02:29,359
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1678
02:02:30,893 --> 02:02:31,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Last email.

1679
02:02:32,514 --> 02:02:32,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys!

1680
02:02:33,855 --> 02:02:38,759
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my first time writing in and I am excited and nervous, so sorry if this comes out sounding weird.

1681
02:02:39,179 --> 02:02:40,100
[SPEAKER_05]: You sound weird!

1682
02:02:41,075 --> 02:02:45,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I just started listening to your podcast this year and it has been one of the greatest things I've ever found on the internet.

1683
02:02:45,719 --> 02:02:48,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Gushing aside, listening to you guys seriously brightens up my day.

1684
02:02:48,641 --> 02:02:49,882
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like more gushing.

1685
02:02:49,942 --> 02:02:50,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1686
02:02:51,123 --> 02:02:56,127
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually wanted to get your opinion on two topics, with the first being buying used games.

1687
02:02:56,587 --> 02:03:03,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, I know that you were staunch proponent for buying games and hardware because it purports the industry and gets people to keep developing.

1688
02:03:04,293 --> 02:03:08,937
[SPEAKER_11]: However, in my case, the money just doesn't exist for me to buy new games most of the time, so I buy mainly...

1689
02:03:11,929 --> 02:03:12,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you missed a word.

1690
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:15,631
[SPEAKER_11]: So I buy mainly used and then new when I can.

1691
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:21,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So what kind of effect do you think used game buyers have on the industry since our money isn't going directly to the company?

1692
02:03:22,175 --> 02:03:23,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll end it with that one for right now.

1693
02:03:23,502 --> 02:03:26,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't think I'm against buying used games.

1694
02:03:26,504 --> 02:03:28,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't really do it myself.

1695
02:03:29,026 --> 02:03:30,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have a good reason why.

1696
02:03:30,227 --> 02:03:32,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I just like kind of knowing where the game's been.

1697
02:03:32,689 --> 02:03:33,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I will, though.

1698
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:37,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually buy games either when they first come out or not at all, or when they get very, very cheap.

1699
02:03:39,194 --> 02:03:39,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1700
02:03:39,914 --> 02:03:41,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say I'm against used game buying.

1701
02:03:41,796 --> 02:03:44,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just part of the nature of the entertainment business.

1702
02:03:44,858 --> 02:03:46,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing happens with DVDs.

1703
02:03:46,219 --> 02:03:50,963
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't killed the movie studios yet, so I'm not against it, actually.

1704
02:03:51,730 --> 02:03:52,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1705
02:04:08,147 --> 02:04:09,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Not exactly.

1706
02:04:09,669 --> 02:04:13,692
[SPEAKER_11]: You're indirectly, I think, helping the industry because you're helping the economy.

1707
02:04:15,094 --> 02:04:24,182
[SPEAKER_11]: By keeping cash in, cash out, by keeping the flow of business going, you're eventually putting more money in people's pockets to be able to go out and buy new games.

1708
02:04:24,863 --> 02:04:26,925
[SPEAKER_11]: For lack of a better way to put it.

1709
02:04:27,179 --> 02:04:32,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And with all the download content that's out there now in this day and age, I don't think these companies are going to be particularly bankrupt.

1710
02:04:32,481 --> 02:04:36,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think companies do this pay to unlock crap in the first place?

1711
02:04:36,802 --> 02:04:39,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think companies do this pay to unlock crap in the first place?

1712
02:04:39,724 --> 02:04:42,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's their way of still making a little bit of money even off of used games.

1713
02:04:43,145 --> 02:04:43,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it.

1714
02:04:43,945 --> 02:04:44,385
[SPEAKER_11]: There's that.

1715
02:04:45,026 --> 02:04:47,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Second question is this.

1716
02:04:47,387 --> 02:04:50,688
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think about the concept of a semi-hardcore gamer?

1717
02:04:51,068 --> 02:04:53,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel... Wait, I gotta read this for the chat.

1718
02:04:53,649 --> 02:04:57,591
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says you don't buy used underwear, but they sell it at thrift stores.

1719
02:04:57,891 --> 02:04:58,932
[SPEAKER_11]: People do buy used underwear.

1720
02:04:59,672 --> 02:05:04,374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's frightening, but they also do sell used underwear and vending machines.

1721
02:05:04,774 --> 02:05:09,056
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, myself, I also don't, you know, put my dick next to a video game.

1722
02:05:09,216 --> 02:05:09,816
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1723
02:05:10,417 --> 02:05:11,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?

1724
02:05:12,651 --> 02:05:13,892
[SPEAKER_11]: My second question is this.

1725
02:05:13,912 --> 02:05:15,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody else might have though, I guess.

1726
02:05:15,673 --> 02:05:17,174
[SPEAKER_06]: There's your reason not to buy a used game.

1727
02:05:17,514 --> 02:05:18,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1728
02:05:18,155 --> 02:05:18,455
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1729
02:05:18,875 --> 02:05:19,355
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

1730
02:05:19,375 --> 02:05:20,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody put their balls on it.

1731
02:05:21,156 --> 02:05:21,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob!

1732
02:05:22,777 --> 02:05:25,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna do that.

1733
02:05:25,399 --> 02:05:30,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I take my games back to GameStop now, I'm gonna give them one last goodbye by placing my balls on them.

1734
02:05:31,123 --> 02:05:31,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1735
02:05:31,963 --> 02:05:32,263
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1736
02:05:36,686 --> 02:05:37,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

1737
02:05:38,988 --> 02:05:39,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1738
02:05:40,208 --> 02:05:40,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Balls on game.

1739
02:05:41,331 --> 02:05:43,732
[SPEAKER_11]: My second question is this.

1740
02:05:44,392 --> 02:05:46,893
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think about the concept of a semi-hardcore gamer?

1741
02:05:46,993 --> 02:05:48,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you feel they exist?

1742
02:05:48,134 --> 02:05:52,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And if so, why are they often overlooked in gaming discussion and marketing?

1743
02:05:54,757 --> 02:05:56,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say I'm a semi-hardcore gamer.

1744
02:05:56,838 --> 02:05:58,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really consider myself a hardcore gamer.

1745
02:05:59,239 --> 02:06:01,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Take one look at my gamer score on Xbox Live.

1746
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:02,380
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see I'm not a hardcore gamer.

1747
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:04,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we actually fit into that category somewhere.

1748
02:06:05,121 --> 02:06:08,883
[SPEAKER_06]: We're more like educated gamers where we enjoy that we're enthusiasts.

1749
02:06:09,483 --> 02:06:10,903
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that word a whole lot.

1750
02:06:10,923 --> 02:06:12,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We're enthusiasts.

1751
02:06:12,084 --> 02:06:14,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I don't think we're necessarily hardcore.

1752
02:06:15,085 --> 02:06:22,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of us, between our jobs, our significant others, our other hobbies, we don't have time to play a lot of video games.

1753
02:06:23,327 --> 02:06:24,367
[SPEAKER_06]: But we play enough.

1754
02:06:24,987 --> 02:06:26,047
[SPEAKER_06]: We're somewhere in the middle there.

1755
02:06:26,468 --> 02:06:28,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, absolutely semi-hardcore gamers exist.

1756
02:06:28,968 --> 02:06:30,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And what was the second part of the question?

1757
02:06:30,229 --> 02:06:30,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they exist?

1758
02:06:30,989 --> 02:06:31,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so...

1759
02:06:32,911 --> 02:06:43,168
[SPEAKER_11]: if so, why are they oh crap, I hit reply by accident okay if so, why are they often overlooked in gaming discussion and marketing um

1760
02:06:44,209 --> 02:06:44,930
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good question.

1761
02:07:09,969 --> 02:07:11,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, yeah, that's true too.

1762
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:19,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think for a lot of people, especially the semi-hardcore gamers, if you will, they're more hardcore about certain types of games than others.

1763
02:07:19,515 --> 02:07:21,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's another reason why I think we fit in this category.

1764
02:07:22,137 --> 02:07:26,860
[SPEAKER_06]: A hardcore gamer, wouldn't a true hardcore gamer play all games no matter what?

1765
02:07:27,381 --> 02:07:32,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that actually it has to go more towards hardcore into what you're really into.

1766
02:07:32,464 --> 02:07:35,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I would say I'm definitely hardcore into Sims 3 right now.

1767
02:07:36,006 --> 02:07:37,708
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you were hardcore in World of Warcraft.

1768
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,428
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a hardcore nerd.

1769
02:07:38,908 --> 02:07:39,149
[SPEAKER_11]: So?

1770
02:07:40,209 --> 02:07:42,671
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wouldn't say I'm necessarily a hardcore gamer.

1771
02:07:42,711 --> 02:07:45,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play Madden or sports games that come out.

1772
02:07:45,153 --> 02:07:47,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so stupid in those type of games.

1773
02:07:47,495 --> 02:07:49,457
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it has to do with what you like best.

1774
02:07:51,278 --> 02:07:53,160
[SPEAKER_11]: For me, I play Sims all day.

1775
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:56,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Then again, I also am not working and can't really do much with my hand.

1776
02:07:57,629 --> 02:08:02,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, when you were playing, like, but like I say, when you were playing World of Warcraft and you were playing Final Fantasy XI, weren't you fairly gung-ho?

1777
02:08:02,633 --> 02:08:03,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty much.

1778
02:08:03,834 --> 02:08:06,195
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it all has to do with what you're into.

1779
02:08:06,235 --> 02:08:07,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, there's people that live on Evercrack.

1780
02:08:07,937 --> 02:08:08,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

1781
02:08:09,278 --> 02:08:12,880
[SPEAKER_11]: That's... And people who go, oh, all I do is play World of Warcraft.

1782
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,762
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you weren't that bad, but that's hardcore.

1783
02:08:15,322 --> 02:08:18,865
[SPEAKER_11]: There's people that live on the internet and end up like the kids in South Park at the end of that episode.

1784
02:08:19,385 --> 02:08:19,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom!

1785
02:08:20,145 --> 02:08:20,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Bathroom.

1786
02:08:21,967 --> 02:08:22,147
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

1787
02:08:24,336 --> 02:08:24,676
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1788
02:08:24,716 --> 02:08:27,117
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it's not necessarily an overlooking.

1789
02:08:27,177 --> 02:08:32,338
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just also you have to keep in mind that our society tends to work in extremes.

1790
02:08:34,078 --> 02:08:41,120
[SPEAKER_11]: A or B. The shades of gray would probably not be cost effective to market to.

1791
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:49,822
[SPEAKER_11]: So they go for A or B and hope that A 2.0 is somewhere in the middle of it.

1792
02:08:50,522 --> 02:08:51,922
[SPEAKER_11]: All those little decimals in between.

1793
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:59,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that answers the question why people don't break down things further into the semi-hardcore because it's got to be one extreme or the other.

1794
02:09:00,385 --> 02:09:02,186
[SPEAKER_11]: It was awesome to get a chance to talk to you guys.

1795
02:09:02,306 --> 02:09:03,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Later, Molten Brown.

1796
02:09:04,207 --> 02:09:05,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thanks for emailing us, dude.

1797
02:09:05,868 --> 02:09:09,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Try not to get some Molten Brown on your DVDs before you give them back.

1798
02:09:09,271 --> 02:09:09,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shush.

1799
02:09:10,352 --> 02:09:11,432
[SPEAKER_11]: You're awful, Rob.

1800
02:09:11,593 --> 02:09:12,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Awful.

1801
02:09:13,234 --> 02:09:13,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Call in, dude.

1802
02:09:13,954 --> 02:09:14,675
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to talk to you.

1803
02:09:16,056 --> 02:09:18,578
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, I must say,

1804
02:09:19,848 --> 02:09:20,929
[SPEAKER_11]: This must be said.

1805
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:28,257
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a very intelligently worded email and I found no grammatical errors.

1806
02:09:28,398 --> 02:09:29,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Email of the week.

1807
02:09:29,319 --> 02:09:29,979
[SPEAKER_06]: A winner is you.

1808
02:09:30,039 --> 02:09:30,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Congrats.

1809
02:09:32,182 --> 02:09:32,502
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1810
02:09:33,603 --> 02:09:37,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Fear of the Claw says, why are we still discussing testicular insertion instead of video games?

1811
02:09:37,908 --> 02:09:41,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, my last comment was referring to putting your butt on it.

1812
02:09:42,864 --> 02:09:44,425
[SPEAKER_11]: You said putting your balls on it.

1813
02:09:44,985 --> 02:09:45,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I did that too.

1814
02:09:45,625 --> 02:09:48,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you wipe your balls with your balls.

1815
02:09:50,027 --> 02:09:52,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless someone wipes your balls with their butt or something.

1816
02:09:52,989 --> 02:09:54,209
[SPEAKER_11]: That is really disgusting.

1817
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:57,071
[SPEAKER_06]: We're laughing because it's funny and we're immature.

1818
02:09:59,752 --> 02:10:00,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

1819
02:10:02,993 --> 02:10:06,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've disgusted a lot of our listeners tonight and rightfully so.

1820
02:10:07,819 --> 02:10:09,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the listeners are ready for the FUs of the week.

1821
02:10:09,946 --> 02:10:11,812
[SPEAKER_06]: They are definitely ready for the FUs of the week.

1822
02:10:27,728 --> 02:10:30,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And wouldn't you know, tonight's inspiration comes from World of Warcraft.

1823
02:10:30,810 --> 02:10:38,276
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, it's an 18-year-old who lives in Greenwood, Indiana, currently being investigated by the FBI for making serious threats on World of Warcraft.

1824
02:10:38,757 --> 02:10:47,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently on Monday, he said in-game that he was, quote, going to board a plane at 7.30 to Chicago and that he was going to try and kill as many Americans as possible.

1825
02:10:47,723 --> 02:10:49,585
[SPEAKER_06]: He left some other messages as well.

1826
02:10:49,905 --> 02:10:53,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard notified the authorities believing the person was serious.

1827
02:10:54,369 --> 02:10:54,589
[SPEAKER_06]: The...

1828
02:10:55,029 --> 02:11:08,654
[SPEAKER_06]: The person who's been charged with this claimed that their account was hacked, but then the kid later owned up, saying it was a joke, basically stemming from the belief that the cops wouldn't really go to your house if you make serious terrorist threats.

1829
02:11:09,214 --> 02:11:09,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops!

1830
02:11:11,395 --> 02:11:14,056
[SPEAKER_06]: You were wrong on that one, weren't you, dumbass?

1831
02:11:15,977 --> 02:11:17,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into the FUs of the week.

1832
02:11:18,538 --> 02:11:23,900
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU goes to my hand for hurting like a motherfucker.

1833
02:11:24,815 --> 02:11:26,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, like a motherfucker.

1834
02:11:26,355 --> 02:11:29,276
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason why it hurts is because I had... It was fucking mothers?

1835
02:11:30,777 --> 02:11:34,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I had my physical therapy and the exercises hurt quite a bit.

1836
02:11:35,438 --> 02:11:38,559
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, another F you to the suture that was left in my hand.

1837
02:11:38,719 --> 02:11:41,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand why it was left in, but it's a pain in the ass.

1838
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:43,401
[SPEAKER_11]: A pain in the hand, really, I should say.

1839
02:11:43,421 --> 02:11:44,841
[SPEAKER_11]: A pain in my palm.

1840
02:11:46,102 --> 02:11:46,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate it.

1841
02:11:48,782 --> 02:11:49,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.

1842
02:11:49,383 --> 02:11:51,143
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy is a stupid stupid.

1843
02:11:52,183 --> 02:11:52,824
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he is.

1844
02:11:53,504 --> 02:11:53,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1845
02:11:55,370 --> 02:12:02,858
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to having the volunteer on Friday, because painting a fence in 100 degree weather is totally how I'd like to spend my Friday afternoon.

1846
02:12:03,659 --> 02:12:06,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I'm too lazy to tell them no.

1847
02:12:08,224 --> 02:12:09,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to the weather because it's too hot.

1848
02:12:10,638 --> 02:12:12,319
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week definitely goes to the weather.

1849
02:12:12,499 --> 02:12:13,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck the sun.

1850
02:12:13,620 --> 02:12:14,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I am dying.

1851
02:12:14,241 --> 02:12:16,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I seriously, like, I just need to sleep or something.

1852
02:12:16,843 --> 02:12:18,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling so sick right now.

1853
02:12:18,144 --> 02:12:19,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm just, like, off.

1854
02:12:19,545 --> 02:12:20,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna keel over and die or something.

1855
02:12:21,366 --> 02:12:23,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, but, man, the heat sucks.

1856
02:12:23,768 --> 02:12:25,569
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's weird, I've been indoors most of the day.

1857
02:12:25,609 --> 02:12:29,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I was out in the car for a while driving around, but it wasn't that hot.

1858
02:12:29,632 --> 02:12:30,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been drinking water.

1859
02:12:30,913 --> 02:12:31,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm gonna get more, though.

1860
02:12:32,514 --> 02:12:36,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna sneak out during the next story and get more water, because water rocks.

1861
02:12:37,445 --> 02:12:39,047
[SPEAKER_10]: You want some more lemonade?

1862
02:12:39,467 --> 02:12:40,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I made a fresh thing of it.

1863
02:12:40,548 --> 02:12:42,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, I want more lemonade.

1864
02:12:44,372 --> 02:12:46,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I love having a woman on the show who makes me food and drink.

1865
02:12:47,494 --> 02:12:51,378
[SPEAKER_11]: First and foremost, you have a southern woman and you're in my home.

1866
02:12:52,579 --> 02:12:55,562
[SPEAKER_06]: She is serving me drinks out of a mason jar, by the way, just so you know.

1867
02:12:56,135 --> 02:13:02,116
[SPEAKER_11]: It is natural for me to want to make sure that you guys, as my guests, are taken care of.

1868
02:13:02,376 --> 02:13:03,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate it.

1869
02:13:03,656 --> 02:13:07,197
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if you want to blame something, blame Alabama.

1870
02:13:07,837 --> 02:13:09,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you, Alabama.

1871
02:13:09,837 --> 02:13:11,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Now get in the kitchen and get me some pie.

1872
02:13:12,838 --> 02:13:14,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'll give you pie.

1873
02:13:17,399 --> 02:13:19,999
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you a mud pie from your backyard.

1874
02:13:20,579 --> 02:13:22,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe one of Shermie's cat pies.

1875
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:23,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you a pie. 3.14159.

1876
02:13:26,383 --> 02:13:27,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

1877
02:13:27,283 --> 02:13:31,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, help save our show from the completely immature path it's gone down.

1878
02:13:31,905 --> 02:13:33,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see.

1879
02:13:33,806 --> 02:13:39,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess I could talk about this really unique game coming out called Miner Wars.

1880
02:13:40,108 --> 02:13:43,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an MMO for the PC and Xbox Live Arcade.

1881
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:46,191
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's something you normally don't see.

1882
02:13:46,551 --> 02:13:48,192
[SPEAKER_03]: It's apparently coming from a...

1883
02:13:49,272 --> 02:14:11,390
[SPEAKER_03]: SoftwareHouse named Keen and I guess their new space shooter MMO Miner Wars they're planning on releasing on Xbox Live Arcade as well as PC and it's I guess coming it's supposedly coming out I guess autumn 2009 and that's kind of interesting so yeah

1884
02:14:12,915 --> 02:14:32,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, they're saying that the world premiere will be August 2000, or autumn I'm sorry, I read that wrong, autumn 2009 so I wonder if that's coming out or if that's the first time we're going to see it who knows, but the fact that they're putting an MMO on Xbox Live Arcade would be interesting I wonder how they're going to do that Interesting and the two are supposed to talk to each other?

1885
02:14:32,948 --> 02:14:34,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what I'm understanding right?

1886
02:14:34,228 --> 02:14:41,473
[SPEAKER_06]: That the two games would actually talk to each other through PC people could play on and so forth?

1887
02:14:41,815 --> 02:14:47,905
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that they'd like to do, and there were probably some compromises, but they're going to try to incorporate it.

1888
02:14:49,808 --> 02:14:50,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1889
02:14:51,791 --> 02:14:52,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1890
02:14:52,577 --> 02:14:53,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was pretty cool.

1891
02:14:53,877 --> 02:15:00,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess the concept's cool, though, but doesn't... I mean, like, what if the game itself sucks, though?

1892
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:04,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's kind of like, I'm reminded of the game I played this week, BitBoy.

1893
02:15:04,541 --> 02:15:13,044
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded great in writing, and the whole idea of an MMO that's on Xbox Live Arcade and PC is great in writing, but if the game itself kind of blows, then what can you do?

1894
02:15:13,764 --> 02:15:16,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that much, I guess, but I guess we'll have to find out.

1895
02:15:16,285 --> 02:15:17,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe try the demo.

1896
02:15:18,205 --> 02:15:18,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

1897
02:15:18,725 --> 02:15:19,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that means there would be a demo.

1898
02:15:20,874 --> 02:15:22,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least there's that, if nothing else.

1899
02:15:23,297 --> 02:15:30,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, we got one more story for you guys before we open up the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1900
02:15:31,367 --> 02:15:35,733
[SPEAKER_06]: And that story is about a game franchise I'm sure you're excited to see.

1901
02:15:36,594 --> 02:15:38,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Murder, She Wrote is getting a franchise.

1902
02:15:38,857 --> 02:15:39,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1903
02:15:39,838 --> 02:15:40,098
[SPEAKER_06]: X-Rated

1904
02:16:08,308 --> 02:16:10,669
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you want to see topless Angela Lansbury, come on.

1905
02:16:11,429 --> 02:16:12,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

1906
02:16:13,250 --> 02:16:13,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1907
02:16:14,650 --> 02:16:16,611
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is happening in this game here?

1908
02:16:16,871 --> 02:16:23,453
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the Summer Garden Festival that you... What the hell is this game?

1909
02:16:24,847 --> 02:16:30,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Today is the Summer Gardens Festival Gardens Competition and Tour, an event I look forward to all year.

1910
02:16:30,816 --> 02:16:37,385
[SPEAKER_06]: My tour group arrived at Matthew O'Neill's house at approximately 12.45pm only to discover Matthew lying dead in his garden.

1911
02:16:37,405 --> 02:16:40,810
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically you're going to explore a garden and try to find out who killed this person.

1912
02:16:41,701 --> 02:16:42,562
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1913
02:17:04,377 --> 02:17:10,743
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to call in and talk about Murder, She Wrote or any game, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1914
02:17:11,203 --> 02:17:13,845
[SPEAKER_06]: For now, I'll open it up in studio to some last minute stories.

1915
02:17:14,406 --> 02:17:16,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil 4 will be coming to the iPhone in July.

1916
02:17:16,888 --> 02:17:24,095
[SPEAKER_03]: This is realized after it shortly leaked out and was pulled, but Capcom has confirmed they'll be... Hold on, we have a call.

1917
02:17:24,135 --> 02:17:25,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1918
02:17:25,115 --> 02:17:25,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1919
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:28,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

1920
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:30,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1921
02:17:30,421 --> 02:17:30,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's this?

1922
02:17:31,521 --> 02:17:32,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is Juan Gonzalez.

1923
02:17:34,222 --> 02:17:37,443
[SPEAKER_06]: So wait, are you the guy that emailed us earlier and I said, no, it's spam?

1924
02:17:39,064 --> 02:17:42,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I take back my declaration of FU.

1925
02:17:42,045 --> 02:17:42,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1926
02:17:43,746 --> 02:17:53,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how many emails we get from guys named Juan that say something about like completely off the topic and nonsensical that turn out to be spam?

1927
02:17:57,051 --> 02:17:57,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello?

1928
02:17:58,641 --> 02:18:05,792
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can hear me right now, but I accidentally pressed email to everyone.

1929
02:18:07,073 --> 02:18:10,619
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are a real person and you're not trying to sell us a Viagra?

1930
02:18:12,932 --> 02:18:13,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

1931
02:18:13,813 --> 02:18:15,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's breaking up.

1932
02:18:15,434 --> 02:18:15,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

1933
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:41,741
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a question, go ahead and ask.

1934
02:18:41,761 --> 02:18:45,543
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having a hard time hearing you, so try to get your question out there so we can answer it.

1935
02:18:50,486 --> 02:18:50,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, fail.

1936
02:18:51,647 --> 02:18:52,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Juan.

1937
02:18:53,148 --> 02:18:55,109
[SPEAKER_06]: But we take back what we said about you being a spammer.

1938
02:18:55,649 --> 02:18:56,330
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so funny.

1939
02:18:58,846 --> 02:19:01,428
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, sorry the connection was bad, Juan.

1940
02:19:01,448 --> 02:19:06,991
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, guys, if you're going to call in on Skype, you can always call Echo123 to call and test your call first.

1941
02:19:07,011 --> 02:19:07,972
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always a good way to do it.

1942
02:19:08,292 --> 02:19:09,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1943
02:19:09,333 --> 02:19:09,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1944
02:19:11,134 --> 02:19:12,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

1945
02:19:12,775 --> 02:19:13,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Spazinator.

1946
02:19:13,395 --> 02:19:13,876
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1947
02:19:15,657 --> 02:19:19,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like, you know, three really quick tips.

1948
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:20,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1949
02:19:21,300 --> 02:19:33,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I forget whether it was at the very end of Bobby's show or at the beginning of your show proper, but regardless, you guys were talking about

1950
02:19:34,961 --> 02:19:56,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Namco Museum Essentials they had just come out Yes, and just to restate in case we have people listening to our show that aren't listening to Bobby's show which shame on you, everybody should listen to Bobby but at the little toss we did at the end of Bobby's show we had brought up the whole Playstation 3 Namco Essentials had come out and I had wanted to check it out and I'm guessing maybe you got a chance to?

1951
02:19:58,627 --> 02:20:03,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, in fact I had just bought it literally bought it the day it came out

1952
02:20:04,717 --> 02:20:26,246
[SPEAKER_01]: and in my opinion, well, I don't know if my opinion holds any weight, but basically, for the most part, the games are basically the same as any other version that they may have gotten over the years, whether it be for the PlayStation 2 or what have you.

1953
02:20:26,346 --> 02:20:28,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the real draw is, is...

1954
02:20:31,462 --> 02:20:49,589
[SPEAKER_01]: In the menu system, they give you a card for each of the six games, and you get stamped for in-game achievements, like Apple and Pac-Man or whatever.

1955
02:20:51,109 --> 02:20:54,951
[SPEAKER_06]: So not trophies, but kind of like a localized in-game achievement type of thing.

1956
02:20:55,771 --> 02:20:55,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1957
02:20:56,471 --> 02:20:56,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1958
02:20:56,971 --> 02:20:58,612
[SPEAKER_06]: How many games do you get for your $10?

1959
02:20:59,352 --> 02:21:09,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you get, like, I mean, that's one thing I noticed right off the bat, is that, well, on Xbox Live, you have to pay, like, $5 for the port of Pac-Man, but it seems like on this little Namco collection, you're getting, like, what, six games for $10?

1960
02:21:09,415 --> 02:21:22,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, six games for $10, but what I was going to say is, where the draw is, is that with those cards, if you...

1961
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:44,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Get so many stamps per card, like let's say three stamps on a card, then you get a trophy, get another three more, you unlock certain prizes that go with the phone, like t-shirts or other items.

1962
02:21:46,636 --> 02:21:48,137
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on and so forth.

1963
02:21:48,377 --> 02:21:50,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, you get the online leaderboards and all that.

1964
02:21:51,099 --> 02:21:53,481
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably where the main draw is.

1965
02:21:54,061 --> 02:21:55,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, is it cool though?

1966
02:21:55,202 --> 02:21:58,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in theory, that concept sounds really cool to me.

1967
02:21:58,204 --> 02:21:58,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So you picked it up.

1968
02:21:58,884 --> 02:22:00,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, have you unlocked anything at home?

1969
02:22:00,886 --> 02:22:01,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it cool?

1970
02:22:01,366 --> 02:22:03,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it kind of work the way you think it would?

1971
02:22:05,128 --> 02:22:06,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1972
02:22:06,690 --> 02:22:09,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I got like two t-shirts out of it so far.

1973
02:22:10,652 --> 02:22:14,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus, I actually, while I was at home...

1974
02:22:15,445 --> 02:22:29,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually launched each of the games from insightful and I walked up to each of the replicas of the arcade machines and played the games and they seemed pretty good.

1975
02:22:30,593 --> 02:22:34,396
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a neat little plus there.

1976
02:22:35,396 --> 02:22:42,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus, you know, technically it's not tired games

1977
02:22:42,911 --> 02:22:44,933
[SPEAKER_01]: by playing the arcade stuff in there, like...

1978
02:23:00,566 --> 02:23:03,508
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get collector's items, a version of solo cans, and stuff like that.

1979
02:23:03,528 --> 02:23:07,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll finally have motivation to open up the Orange Lounge Club at home too.

1980
02:23:07,551 --> 02:23:07,731
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

1981
02:23:26,764 --> 02:23:31,046
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Spazinator, we've got to hang up to get some more calls, but do you have anything else on your mind real quick?

1982
02:23:32,727 --> 02:23:35,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one last thing.

1983
02:23:35,949 --> 02:23:39,571
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys like to animate a lot.

1984
02:23:40,051 --> 02:23:45,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I just checked out a new movie called Robotech, The Shadow Chronicles.

1985
02:23:45,814 --> 02:23:52,358
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an $8 movie that you get from PSN, and it's pretty good.

1986
02:23:53,018 --> 02:23:56,160
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like cheap animated movies, you may want to check that out.

1987
02:23:56,525 --> 02:23:57,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so there you go.

1988
02:23:57,986 --> 02:23:58,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Anime recommendation.

1989
02:23:59,066 --> 02:24:05,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a huge anime fan, but I'm definitely looking forward to Ponyo, because I do like Miyazaki films, so I'm going to check that out when it comes out in theaters.

1990
02:24:07,169 --> 02:24:08,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I will go with you, Rob.

1991
02:24:08,850 --> 02:24:11,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, good, because the boyfriend won't, because he says anime is not good.

1992
02:24:12,771 --> 02:24:14,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, poo!

1993
02:24:16,113 --> 02:24:17,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Although he's not really dumb.

1994
02:24:17,153 --> 02:24:18,113
[SPEAKER_06]: He's amazing, but anyway.

1995
02:24:18,454 --> 02:24:19,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, take care, Spazinator.

1996
02:24:20,774 --> 02:24:21,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, have a good one.

1997
02:24:21,735 --> 02:24:21,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1998
02:24:23,095 --> 02:24:24,616
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, I'm like, you love Disney.

1999
02:24:24,796 --> 02:24:26,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, Disney's putting this movie out.

2000
02:24:26,337 --> 02:24:27,257
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, but it's different.

2001
02:24:27,297 --> 02:24:27,798
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same.

2002
02:24:27,858 --> 02:24:31,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, ah, ah, I can't take it.

2003
02:24:32,801 --> 02:24:33,001
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2004
02:24:33,021 --> 02:24:33,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2005
02:24:33,961 --> 02:24:34,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2006
02:24:36,923 --> 02:24:37,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hold on.

2007
02:24:39,164 --> 02:24:39,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sure.

2008
02:24:39,745 --> 02:24:40,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hold.

2009
02:24:41,025 --> 02:24:41,305
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2010
02:24:41,365 --> 02:24:42,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Deathwishing.

2011
02:24:42,286 --> 02:24:43,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi, Deathwishing.

2012
02:24:43,186 --> 02:24:43,727
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

2013
02:24:45,128 --> 02:24:47,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Nike popped up and it kind of clusterfucked me.

2014
02:24:48,290 --> 02:24:48,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

2015
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:49,050
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

2016
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:50,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, giant robots.

2017
02:24:51,391 --> 02:24:51,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

2018
02:24:52,412 --> 02:24:52,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of them.

2019
02:24:53,372 --> 02:24:55,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really itching to play a giant robot game.

2020
02:24:55,813 --> 02:24:56,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like an awesome game.

2021
02:24:57,794 --> 02:24:58,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me more.

2022
02:24:59,715 --> 02:25:01,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I mean Chromehounds.

2023
02:25:01,096 --> 02:25:05,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play Chromehounds and stuff, but... There's too much stuff going on right now.

2024
02:25:06,438 --> 02:25:10,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got Marvel vs. Capcom being re-released, and...

2025
02:25:12,717 --> 02:25:14,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome Superhero Hadouken Fest.

2026
02:25:17,222 --> 02:25:17,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2027
02:25:17,603 --> 02:25:20,285
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many games to play in so little time.

2028
02:25:20,686 --> 02:25:23,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea people were still playing Chromehounds, though.

2029
02:25:23,930 --> 02:25:24,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think they are.

2030
02:25:24,690 --> 02:25:27,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I see my friend playing it from Britain a lot of times.

2031
02:25:27,694 --> 02:25:30,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think fans are devoted to their games.

2032
02:25:30,537 --> 02:25:31,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, look at Counter-Strike.

2033
02:25:32,619 --> 02:25:33,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Night Vision Goggle Modern Warfare 2

2034
02:25:59,007 --> 02:26:01,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I might not want to see what goes on when it's dark.

2035
02:26:01,808 --> 02:26:03,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not worth the price, seriously.

2036
02:26:03,909 --> 02:26:05,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, they do something.

2037
02:26:05,690 --> 02:26:08,572
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a webcam with the IR filter ripped off of it.

2038
02:26:09,554 --> 02:26:10,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're probably right.

2039
02:26:11,254 --> 02:26:15,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I wanted night vision goggles, which I don't even know what the hell I'd use night vision goggles for.

2040
02:26:15,715 --> 02:26:18,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the question is, what would you use them for?

2041
02:26:19,076 --> 02:26:19,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2042
02:26:21,376 --> 02:26:23,817
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was just curious.

2043
02:26:24,357 --> 02:26:27,097
[SPEAKER_04]: When I heard night vision goggles, I'm like, wow.

2044
02:26:27,137 --> 02:26:29,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Before they announced the price, I'm like, holy crap, this must be a fortune.

2045
02:26:29,518 --> 02:26:33,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to go look at prices for the ones that look exactly like those, and it was like $3,000.

2046
02:26:34,038 --> 02:26:37,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, holy crap, these are going to be like ones you go to Toys R Us to buy.

2047
02:26:38,641 --> 02:26:41,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just because Activision needs yet another game over $100.

2048
02:26:41,323 --> 02:26:45,567
[SPEAKER_03]: How many games can we put out there at $120 and plus?

2049
02:26:45,607 --> 02:26:47,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a good game.

2050
02:26:47,449 --> 02:26:48,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's going to be a good game.

2051
02:26:48,530 --> 02:26:49,791
[SPEAKER_04]: It's made by Infinity Ward.

2052
02:26:49,891 --> 02:26:51,512
[SPEAKER_04]: They make the good shooters.

2053
02:26:51,872 --> 02:26:53,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a shooter guy.

2054
02:26:53,954 --> 02:26:56,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't doubt it'll be a good game, but I think Activision makes a poor decision.

2055
02:26:56,696 --> 02:27:01,280
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just literally whipping it out, fapping as hard as you can.

2056
02:27:03,322 --> 02:27:03,682
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2057
02:27:07,119 --> 02:27:08,580
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great game review right there.

2058
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:18,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some of these pack-ins are a little silly, but I guess Night Vision Goggles is certainly... Are you guys going to Comic Con?

2059
02:27:19,383 --> 02:27:19,623
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2060
02:27:19,864 --> 02:27:21,924
[SPEAKER_06]: There's too many conventions to go on this time of year.

2061
02:27:21,944 --> 02:27:23,905
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to E3, and then I'm still trying to get to PAX.

2062
02:27:24,225 --> 02:27:28,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Which reminds me, actually, we need to look into SAC Anime next month.

2063
02:27:28,987 --> 02:27:29,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

2064
02:27:29,327 --> 02:27:29,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2065
02:27:30,107 --> 02:27:31,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the same weekend as PAX, isn't it?

2066
02:27:31,527 --> 02:27:31,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2067
02:27:34,088 --> 02:27:40,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Southern California As much as I would love to go to Comic Con I think it's this coming weekend, isn't it?

2068
02:27:41,132 --> 02:27:42,773
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this week Yeah, you know what?

2069
02:27:42,893 --> 02:27:45,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't go, I have tickets to a concert What concert?

2070
02:27:46,815 --> 02:27:48,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I tell you, I'm going to see No Doubt

2071
02:27:49,025 --> 02:27:50,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Bioshock 2 got delayed.

2072
02:27:50,086 --> 02:27:50,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

2073
02:27:51,146 --> 02:27:51,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

2074
02:28:19,265 --> 02:28:20,987
[SPEAKER_03]: But Bioshock 2 is never coming out in November.

2075
02:28:21,007 --> 02:28:21,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out in October.

2076
02:28:23,229 --> 02:28:23,449
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2077
02:28:24,049 --> 02:28:25,230
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was coming out.

2078
02:28:26,872 --> 02:28:28,113
[SPEAKER_06]: They delayed it this weekend.

2079
02:28:28,153 --> 02:28:30,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they delayed it, but it was never coming out in November.

2080
02:28:30,174 --> 02:28:31,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out in October.

2081
02:28:32,956 --> 02:28:38,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying November is usually when everyone starts shipping out all their games and it's just like...

2082
02:28:39,645 --> 02:28:41,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.

2083
02:28:41,926 --> 02:28:44,607
[SPEAKER_04]: My wallet is... My pants are burning.

2084
02:28:45,007 --> 02:28:49,028
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Tyrant in chat pointed out that tickets to Comic-Con are sold out anyway, so that's fine.

2085
02:28:49,048 --> 02:28:49,589
[SPEAKER_04]: They are?

2086
02:28:49,609 --> 02:28:50,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Sneak in.

2087
02:28:50,069 --> 02:28:52,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Just break a window or some stuff.

2088
02:28:52,810 --> 02:28:55,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Deathwishing, anything else on your mind before we let you go?

2089
02:28:55,111 --> 02:28:55,931
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta get more calls.

2090
02:28:55,991 --> 02:28:56,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Giant robots.

2091
02:28:57,051 --> 02:28:57,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

2092
02:28:57,772 --> 02:28:58,592

[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2094
02:29:00,553 --> 02:29:01,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Giant robots.

2095
02:29:02,613 --> 02:29:03,154
[SPEAKER_06]: On fire.

2096
02:29:03,654 --> 02:29:04,474
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be even better.

2097
02:29:04,754 --> 02:29:06,315
[SPEAKER_06]: How about giant robots on fire?

2098
02:29:07,059 --> 02:29:10,081
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good, because then that ruins a perfectly good giant robot.

2099
02:29:11,582 --> 02:29:12,743
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's on fire.

2100
02:29:13,283 --> 02:29:15,805
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it has to be a giant robot that shoots fire.

2101
02:29:16,065 --> 02:29:16,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

2102
02:29:16,646 --> 02:29:17,366

[SPEAKER_03]: We have to discuss the giant robot shooting fire.

[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:29:24,111 --> 02:29:26,572
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to let you go, because we've got to talk about robots shooting fire.

2110
02:29:27,693 --> 02:29:28,494
[SPEAKER_06]: The hell with that?

2111
02:29:29,034 --> 02:29:29,935
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, Misty?

2112
02:29:31,552 --> 02:29:36,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Not much really, I just kind of had an announcement I wanted to finally make after trying for practically a month.

2113
02:29:37,337 --> 02:29:39,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what is your big announcement?

2114
02:29:40,279 --> 02:29:43,701
[SPEAKER_12]: That I am finally coming to Sac at the end of August.

2115
02:29:44,962 --> 02:29:47,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy poop balls, you're actually coming to Sacramento.

2116
02:29:49,352 --> 02:29:50,854
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2117
02:30:13,094 --> 02:30:15,315
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really have any particular plans.

2118
02:30:15,375 --> 02:30:19,355
[SPEAKER_12]: I was thinking of going to Arvigil for the hell of it at least one or two days.

2119
02:30:19,535 --> 02:30:20,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, you got to do that.

2120
02:30:20,896 --> 02:30:21,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

2121
02:30:21,856 --> 02:30:22,916
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to see some of the sites.

2122
02:30:23,256 --> 02:30:25,116
[SPEAKER_06]: See some of the OLR historical spots.

2123
02:30:25,216 --> 02:30:28,917
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to go to Arvigil, eat at the Brookfields we used to always eat at at the parking lot.

2124
02:30:29,417 --> 02:30:29,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

2125
02:30:29,917 --> 02:30:32,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't it be cool to have an old school night while she's here?

2126
02:30:32,738 --> 02:30:33,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we can make that happen.

2127
02:30:33,718 --> 02:30:34,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that.

2128
02:30:34,478 --> 02:30:35,098
[SPEAKER_06]: On a Wednesday.

2129
02:30:35,338 --> 02:30:35,858
[SPEAKER_06]: On a Wednesday.

2130
02:30:36,058 --> 02:30:37,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping so.

2131
02:30:37,279 --> 02:30:38,479
[SPEAKER_12]: I kept hearing about that.

2132
02:30:39,266 --> 02:30:41,047
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to make that happen somehow.

2133
02:30:41,127 --> 02:30:44,589
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unfortunately, you're not going to be here on a Sunday, though, right?

2134
02:30:45,509 --> 02:30:47,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because I'm so damn opposed to flying.

2135
02:30:48,191 --> 02:30:48,671
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

2136
02:30:49,151 --> 02:30:51,333
[SPEAKER_06]: But, hey, we'll figure something out.

2137
02:30:51,373 --> 02:30:52,933
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do a taped bit or something.

2138
02:30:52,973 --> 02:30:55,055
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do OLR on location at Arvigal.

2139
02:30:55,915 --> 02:30:57,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

2140
02:30:57,416 --> 02:31:01,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember we used to do it when we had the bit that we did over the old Beatmania?

2141
02:31:01,178 --> 02:31:01,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

2142
02:31:01,858 --> 02:31:02,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Of the Hip Hop Mania.

2143
02:31:02,879 --> 02:31:03,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2144
02:31:03,319 --> 02:31:03,859
[SPEAKER_06]: That was rad.

2145
02:31:03,879 --> 02:31:04,360
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fun.

2146
02:31:05,220 --> 02:31:09,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember getting threatened to throw out of there by kids younger than I am.

2147
02:31:09,282 --> 02:31:11,464
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, that's the way it goes sometimes.

2148
02:31:11,984 --> 02:31:12,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So other things.

2149
02:31:13,064 --> 02:31:15,486
[SPEAKER_06]: What else will be on the OLR Sacramento Historical Tour?

2150
02:31:15,846 --> 02:31:19,768
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go to the Target where we camped out for a wee, where Jamie got recognized from the show.

2151
02:31:19,808 --> 02:31:20,328
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fun.

2152
02:31:20,949 --> 02:31:21,489
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

2153
02:31:21,589 --> 02:31:22,670
[SPEAKER_06]: That's over on Sunrise.

2154
02:31:22,790 --> 02:31:23,570
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what else?

2155
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:25,351
[SPEAKER_06]: What other OLR historical stops are there?

2156
02:31:28,326 --> 02:31:30,087
[SPEAKER_11]: We could try to make the trip to Stockton.

2157
02:31:30,767 --> 02:31:31,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

2158
02:31:31,467 --> 02:31:34,408
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to show Missy the good stuff while you're here?

2159
02:31:35,229 --> 02:31:42,171
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to see some of the cryptic counterbalances to see why the other good stuff is so good.

2160
02:31:42,231 --> 02:31:42,592
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

2161
02:31:42,632 --> 02:31:45,413
[SPEAKER_06]: You could go to Scandia, home of Shaft.

2162
02:31:45,973 --> 02:31:51,595
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll actually have to play the putt-putt there.

2163
02:31:53,396 --> 02:31:55,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And ride the screamer, but you can't scream on it.

2164
02:31:55,877 --> 02:31:56,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2165
02:31:57,992 --> 02:31:58,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2166
02:31:58,573 --> 02:32:00,054
[SPEAKER_06]: All this will be explained all in due time.

2167
02:32:00,335 --> 02:32:05,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hey, let us know again as things are getting a little closer and you got your itinerary all planned out.

2168
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:09,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll definitely meet up with you during the week and figure something out.

2169
02:32:10,405 --> 02:32:10,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

2170
02:32:11,226 --> 02:32:16,611
[SPEAKER_12]: That TwitPic I posted is my incoming itinerary with all the Greyhound stops and crap.

2171
02:32:16,811 --> 02:32:17,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

2172
02:32:19,335 --> 02:32:19,695
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2173
02:32:19,975 --> 02:32:25,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we are looking forward to... I've met you in person, but I know the other two haven't, so we're looking forward to having you here.

2174
02:32:25,737 --> 02:32:31,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've been a long-time listener, so this is the ultimate in fan trips to take.

2175
02:32:32,778 --> 02:32:33,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Indeed.

2176
02:32:33,498 --> 02:32:33,798
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2177
02:32:34,039 --> 02:32:37,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're going to let you go, Misty, so we can get some more calls, but we will see you soon.

2178
02:32:37,459 --> 02:32:37,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean that.

2179
02:32:38,059 --> 02:32:38,580
[SPEAKER_06]: See you soon.

2180
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:40,540
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

2181
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:41,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited.

2182
02:32:41,300 --> 02:32:41,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

2183
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:42,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

2184
02:32:43,721 --> 02:32:45,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe she's taking a bus, though.

2185
02:32:45,661 --> 02:32:46,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my gosh.

2186
02:32:46,401 --> 02:32:48,242
[SPEAKER_06]: That is such a long bus ride.

2187
02:32:49,076 --> 02:32:50,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, trains are going to be just as bad.

2188
02:32:50,517 --> 02:32:51,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a little more expensive too.

2189
02:32:51,838 --> 02:32:53,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, trains are better.

2190
02:32:53,560 --> 02:32:54,661
[SPEAKER_03]: But I understand.

2191
02:32:54,701 --> 02:32:57,423
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're seriously scared to death of planes, I can understand.

2192
02:32:57,443 --> 02:32:58,604
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be tough.

2193
02:32:59,104 --> 02:33:01,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's wrap it up.

2194
02:33:01,686 --> 02:33:02,787
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to close the Skype line.

2195
02:33:02,807 --> 02:33:03,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to those that didn't get through.

2196
02:33:04,369 --> 02:33:06,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's wrap it up with some last minute stories.

2197
02:33:06,510 --> 02:33:08,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you probably have a couple we didn't get to, Loki.

2198
02:33:09,342 --> 02:33:10,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I do.

2199
02:33:26,176 --> 02:33:27,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat.

2200
02:33:28,618 --> 02:33:43,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently there was an artist that worked for Google that was hiding Triforces on a bunch of their little Google splashes that they do for different events, different holidays and whatnot.

2201
02:33:44,111 --> 02:33:49,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately, because of all this buzz about said Triforces, they have now been all removed.

2202
02:33:49,836 --> 02:33:53,159
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was fun while it lasted, I guess.

2203
02:33:55,070 --> 02:33:57,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And the artist responsible has been sacked.

2204
02:33:58,077 --> 02:34:00,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's the case, but maybe.

2205
02:34:02,441 --> 02:34:08,405
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a game coming to North America, rumored at least, Rizzoad.

2206
02:34:09,186 --> 02:34:12,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually, it's a game based off the Wizard of Oz.

2207
02:34:12,829 --> 02:34:14,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of think of Kingdom Hearts meets Wizard of Oz.

2208
02:34:15,731 --> 02:34:19,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the DS, it's rumored to be coming out over here.

2209
02:34:19,113 --> 02:34:20,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I can tell you it's coming out over here.

2210
02:34:20,915 --> 02:34:21,795
[SPEAKER_03]: XSEED's bringing it over.

2211
02:34:23,096 --> 02:34:25,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Be coming out this fall, actually, September 1st.

2212
02:34:26,144 --> 02:34:27,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Or October, I can't remember.

2213
02:34:27,985 --> 02:34:29,645
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, so that's kind of neat.

2214
02:34:29,905 --> 02:34:33,086
[SPEAKER_03]: A new RPG series maybe we can check out.

2215
02:34:34,547 --> 02:34:39,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And Brutal Legend is going to be getting 4 on 4 skirmish multiplayer matches.

2216
02:34:40,049 --> 02:34:41,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot 4 on 4 action.

2217
02:34:41,810 --> 02:34:42,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.

2218
02:34:42,890 --> 02:34:44,591
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

2219
02:34:44,611 --> 02:34:48,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hey, the game looks awesome by itself, but multiplayer, that just adds to the fun.

2220
02:34:51,155 --> 02:35:02,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we talked about this before, but apparently a fan is putting together a game based off of the Free Space Open, which I think is an open source free space engine.

2221
02:35:03,362 --> 02:35:08,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it's Shadows of Liet, which is a Star Fox type of game.

2222
02:35:09,246 --> 02:35:11,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is currently in development right now.

2223
02:35:12,488 --> 02:35:19,052
[SPEAKER_03]: But luckily, I'm guessing at the rate it's going and the amount of coverage it's getting right now, that probably will never happen.

2224
02:35:19,072 --> 02:35:19,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll probably get...

2225
02:35:20,072 --> 02:35:21,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Cease and desist.

2226
02:35:21,773 --> 02:35:22,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is too bad.

2227
02:35:23,354 --> 02:35:28,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, you know, people have been editing the PC version of Street Fighter 4 that has been recently released.

2228
02:35:29,339 --> 02:35:33,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing all sorts of things such as making Cammy nude, which looks retarded.

2229
02:35:34,222 --> 02:35:38,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And swapping people's, um, their movesets.

2230
02:35:38,685 --> 02:35:41,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I was watching Dan with Dhalsim's moves, that's funny.

2231
02:35:41,407 --> 02:35:42,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Which looks pretty funny.

2232
02:35:42,708 --> 02:35:43,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

2233
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:47,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, that's about as bad as when they were doing that with Smash Bros.

2234
02:35:48,021 --> 02:35:52,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a game I'd like to talk about real quick that they had a clip of it online.

2235
02:35:52,242 --> 02:35:53,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks fucking sweet.

2236
02:35:53,883 --> 02:35:57,584
[SPEAKER_03]: It's The Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is the name of the game.

2237
02:35:58,024 --> 02:36:00,924
[SPEAKER_03]: And it kind of has a similar art style to Pot upon.

2238
02:36:01,365 --> 02:36:07,006
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's this game where you fly around a little UFO and it's kind of a shooter puzzle platformer game.

2239
02:36:07,566 --> 02:36:09,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks absolutely crazy.

2240
02:36:09,287 --> 02:36:11,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely check out the video if you haven't yet.

2241
02:36:12,388 --> 02:36:13,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got an awesome little...

2242
02:36:16,374 --> 02:36:25,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the actual website is the incredible insanelytwistedshadowplanet.com I think this is actually the website.

2243
02:36:26,881 --> 02:36:35,206
[SPEAKER_03]: But the guy that's responsible for it is an animator and he's done a bunch of really cool stuff.

2244
02:36:36,007 --> 02:36:37,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely worth checking out.

2245
02:36:38,683 --> 02:36:44,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another game that's supposed to be coming out that looks pretty cool on XNA is Vex and Silence.

2246
02:36:44,805 --> 02:36:50,887
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a kind of a stylized first-person shooter game and actually looks pretty polished for an XNA game.

2247
02:36:51,347 --> 02:36:53,508
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can check out more information on that.

2248
02:36:54,168 --> 02:36:58,689
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to span, I guess, 13 levels and have a side-scrolling shooter as well.

2249
02:36:59,229 --> 02:37:00,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it is a side-scrolling shooter.

2250
02:37:00,310 --> 02:37:02,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like a first-person shooter from what I saw.

2251
02:37:03,431 --> 02:37:07,332
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, VexandSilence.com and that's V-E-K-S

2252
02:37:08,512 --> 02:37:09,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

2253
02:37:10,613 --> 02:37:11,033
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2254
02:37:13,913 --> 02:37:19,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, that's going to wrap it up for our show tonight, but we can't end until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
