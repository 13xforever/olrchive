WEBVTT

00:14.264 --> 00:15.366
[SPEAKER_12]: and I, December 20th, 2009.

00:16.107 --> 00:19.112
[SPEAKER_12]: Is a leaked survey hinting at a paid PlayStation Network?

00:19.353 --> 00:21.477
[SPEAKER_12]: Home gets assaulted with new content.

00:21.797 --> 00:24.542
[SPEAKER_12]: And what video game related show will soon be on PBS?

00:31.547 --> 00:32.027
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:51.961 --> 00:52.821
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm alright.

00:53.422 --> 00:54.582
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little irritated.

00:55.042 --> 00:55.722
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to hear that.

00:56.363 --> 00:56.763
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at me.

00:56.883 --> 00:57.523
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I do something?

00:57.943 --> 01:00.424
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I was just saying, if I ruffled your feathers, I'm extremely sorry.

01:01.264 --> 01:04.385
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the show hasn't really started yet, so maybe at the end of the show you'll be mad at me.

01:04.685 --> 01:05.045
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

01:07.306 --> 01:08.147
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try not to, though.

01:08.387 --> 01:11.548
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and of course, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

01:11.808 --> 01:12.028
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

01:12.268 --> 01:13.888
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's chowing down on wings right now.

01:13.989 --> 01:14.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:14.809 --> 01:15.469
[SPEAKER_13]: Barbecue wings.

01:15.489 --> 01:16.469
[SPEAKER_13]: Been craving them all week.

01:16.529 --> 01:17.110
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you really?

01:17.670 --> 01:20.191
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the whole room smells like barbecue, and damn, I am hungry.

01:20.751 --> 01:21.171
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

01:22.488 --> 01:23.649
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll get a taco after the show.

01:23.669 --> 01:24.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

01:24.309 --> 01:26.770
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me feel a lot better to know at least you're having yummy food.

01:27.130 --> 01:27.950
[SPEAKER_04]: How have you been, Loki?

01:28.210 --> 01:28.790
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been fine.

01:48.937 --> 01:50.738
[SPEAKER_04]: Game of the Decade Game of the Decade Game of the Decade

02:15.331 --> 02:16.092
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

02:35.922 --> 02:38.163
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is really down with the Call of Duties of the world.

02:58.669 --> 02:59.029
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

03:22.056 --> 03:27.218
[SPEAKER_10]: We played Super Mario Wii, which was pretty cool, if annoying, playing multiplayer.

03:27.798 --> 03:30.299
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I just found the multiplayer aspect to be really irritating.

03:30.899 --> 03:32.180
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wasn't fun for me that way.

03:34.040 --> 03:41.283
[SPEAKER_10]: And a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, which if you ignore the whole Civil War storyline, it's actually a really fun game.

03:42.303 --> 03:43.944
[SPEAKER_10]: I hated the Civil War storyline, so...

03:44.557 --> 03:51.441
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad you finally got around to that, because I know we were talking on last week's show, kind of joking, and I still haven't played this game, but I'm glad you finally were able to do it.

03:51.461 --> 03:52.462
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we played a decent bit of it.

03:52.582 --> 03:53.162
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

03:54.083 --> 04:11.413
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played, of course, my Peggle a bunch, and some Solitaire, and Dan was showing us the whole zombie thing in Borderlands and doing the brain hunting thing.

04:12.338 --> 04:22.923
[SPEAKER_10]: And, like, it's kind of funny because the more... You have to go back... You, like, find this... One of the character's buddies who's been turned into a zombie and he's tied to his chair so you have to bring him brains to eat.

04:23.683 --> 04:25.103
[SPEAKER_10]: And he keeps asking for more brains.

04:25.524 --> 04:29.065
[SPEAKER_10]: So as you... You start bringing him, you know, 10 brains and 25 and 50.

04:30.086 --> 04:36.148
[SPEAKER_10]: And as it keeps going, the... It goes brains for the name of the thing.

04:37.189 --> 04:40.090
[SPEAKER_10]: And... But I really...

04:41.650 --> 04:43.052
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

04:58.345 --> 05:05.494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bummer there's not a game like that on the DS where everybody can kind of do their own thing on their own screen, but yet maybe you're still working together.

05:06.234 --> 05:09.138
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's that real element that you're stuck on that screen.

05:09.578 --> 05:10.980
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's both a blessing and a curse.

05:13.223 --> 05:17.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that is it for your gaming week... Oh yeah, and I played some World of Warcraft.

05:18.424 --> 05:18.804
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

05:19.205 --> 05:21.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Then how about the one and only Techmaster Loki?

05:22.247 --> 05:23.567
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't play a whole lot this week.

05:24.228 --> 05:27.830
[SPEAKER_13]: Not as much as I'd want to, finishing up Christmas gifts and stuff.

05:28.491 --> 05:35.876
[SPEAKER_13]: So I played Grand Theft Auto, Ballet Gay Tony, multiplayer.

05:36.376 --> 05:37.057
[SPEAKER_13]: Kicking ass...

05:38.376 --> 05:38.997
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

05:54.383 --> 06:00.246
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you just pretty much just join a, you know, ranked deathmatch game, you're probably going to get into ours.

06:01.187 --> 06:09.631
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, it's funny because we laugh at the people that play with us because most of the time they end up dropping because we're just so intense in the game.

06:10.052 --> 06:15.255
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, not that we're talking trash to them, we don't have microphones or anything, but we just kick the crap out of everybody.

06:15.995 --> 06:22.158
[SPEAKER_13]: Mainly, I kick the crap out of everybody, but, you know, there's a little bit coming my way, but it's funny.

06:22.539 --> 06:23.099
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um...

06:24.790 --> 06:25.090
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

06:25.390 --> 06:29.852
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, other than that, I've played more Bayonetta, and it's awesome.

06:30.072 --> 06:32.673
[SPEAKER_13]: I like some of the stuff later on in the game.

06:33.153 --> 06:37.874
[SPEAKER_13]: You can actually buy new techniques and stuff, and one of the techniques I unlocked is like a windmill.

06:38.334 --> 06:44.716
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like the breakdancing move, so you spin around with the guns blazing on your feet or whatever, and then she stops and does a freeze pose.

06:45.657 --> 06:46.297
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.

06:47.937 --> 06:49.018
[SPEAKER_13]: This game is awesome.

06:49.298 --> 06:50.158
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm so excited.

06:51.519 --> 06:51.819
[SPEAKER_13]: And then...

06:53.103 --> 06:54.685
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

07:11.803 --> 07:13.203
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't that big a deal to me.

07:13.444 --> 07:13.824
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

07:13.944 --> 07:24.567
[SPEAKER_13]: I played that game, so it's kind of like a hovercraft action game or something like that where you're blowing up other robotic hovercrafts and stuff, and it was neat for a little bit.

07:25.248 --> 07:25.628
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.129
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's not something I'd consistently play.

07:30.285 --> 07:30.525
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, um...

07:54.235 --> 07:54.695
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.255
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be cool.

08:25.612 --> 08:32.374
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see, my gaming week, obviously, if you were listening to last week's show, I got that awesome FC Mobile as a gift for the holidays.

08:32.914 --> 08:37.975
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went out on a little bit of a binge and I bought some 8B games and I borrowed from the vault.

08:38.635 --> 08:45.557
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had NES games galore back at home, including an awesome purchase I made at a local games store.

08:45.597 --> 08:48.818
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to where you suggested, Jamie, and I don't know if I told you what I got there.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.739
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I did after last week, but I went to that store we talked about.

08:51.759 --> 08:52.519
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it your game?

08:52.539 --> 08:52.619
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

08:52.839 --> 08:54.661
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to say it on air or not.

08:54.681 --> 08:55.061
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.345
[SPEAKER_04]: I went and got Goonies 2 on the NES.

08:58.425 --> 08:58.885
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fun.

08:59.786 --> 09:01.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a game I just remember.

09:01.528 --> 09:08.214
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't spectacular, I think, when it came out, but I think it was also underrated because a lot of people said, what the hell does this have to do with a movie?

09:08.494 --> 09:09.715
[SPEAKER_04]: But it actually was a pretty cool game.

09:10.336 --> 09:12.999
[SPEAKER_04]: I also bought Slipheed for the Sega CD, which I knew...

09:13.479 --> 09:14.060
[SPEAKER_04]: and Sylphid.

09:39.602 --> 09:39.842
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times!

09:50.506 --> 09:51.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Good 8-bit times

10:19.736 --> 10:22.817
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, as far as my gaming week goes, not a whole lot of other new stuff.

10:23.097 --> 10:25.498
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of World of Warcraft, a little bit of DJ Hero.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.638
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that earlier in the week and got some trophies.

10:27.939 --> 10:29.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I really like DJ Hero.

10:29.959 --> 10:31.900
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorite games to have come out this year.

10:32.360 --> 10:37.601
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't understand why people are like, why it's cool to hate on DJ Hero all of a sudden.

10:37.902 --> 10:42.863
[SPEAKER_04]: Because maybe it's not selling zillions of copies like Guitar Hero and Rock Band do.

10:43.363 --> 10:48.045
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think a lot of this came from those silly VGA awards that happened.

10:48.085 --> 10:48.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it last week?

10:49.505 --> 10:51.166
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Hero won best music game over the Rock Band Beatles

11:10.322 --> 11:11.043
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:24.642 --> 11:26.723
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have given it to DJ Hero too, and I think a lot of people like

11:44.069 --> 11:45.911
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know what I say?

11:45.991 --> 11:48.013
[SPEAKER_13]: Haters to the left because you ain't right.

12:13.203 --> 12:13.703
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:36.138 --> 12:38.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that pretty much does it for our gaming weeks.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.081
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of housekeeping tonight.

12:40.101 --> 12:41.642
[SPEAKER_04]: We have actually some big news in housekeeping.

12:41.682 --> 12:44.244
[SPEAKER_04]: First, the little yet important things out of the way.

12:44.605 --> 12:46.426
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not following us on Twitter, please do.

12:46.726 --> 12:49.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR is our Twitter feed.

12:49.548 --> 12:51.310
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't have us friended on Facebook...

12:51.630 --> 12:52.070
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

12:52.471 --> 12:55.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio all run together.

12:55.853 --> 12:56.514
[SPEAKER_04]: Join our Facebook.

12:56.854 --> 13:00.978
[SPEAKER_04]: We're up to something like 230 friends on Facebook and that's just not even a month.

13:01.078 --> 13:01.878
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much.

13:02.219 --> 13:05.281
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand people have been spreading the word to friends and all that.

13:05.341 --> 13:12.247
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys so much to everyone who's contributed to that and helping spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because, you know, we do do this show for free.

13:13.394 --> 13:16.795
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of spreading the word, how awesome is this?

13:16.955 --> 13:17.735
[SPEAKER_04]: The community.

13:18.475 --> 13:22.496
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself, Jamie, Matt, we have nothing to do with this, honestly.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.297
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we didn't help with this.

13:24.797 --> 13:26.037
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't contribute to this.

13:26.757 --> 13:28.958
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll be damned if we don't love this and support this.

13:29.418 --> 13:32.439
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is this OLR Revolution second mix.

13:33.219 --> 13:34.319
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you guys are familiar with this.

13:34.359 --> 13:36.620
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been on the front of our site, and I think it came up last week.

13:37.420 --> 13:40.601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this DDR Stepmania skin mix.

13:41.021 --> 13:41.862
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:57.723 --> 14:01.688
[SPEAKER_04]: and have put them into this DDR step mania thing.

14:02.109 --> 14:09.599
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess John or DMN from Under Station Live did all the announcer voices because, you know, when Orange Launch Radio was a station, that show was on our station.

14:09.959 --> 14:12.022
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's certainly a part of the OLR family too.

14:12.803 --> 14:13.924
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just this whole thing that...

14:14.585 --> 14:16.026
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

14:32.879 --> 14:59.401
[SPEAKER_04]: VGA award winning type of game here I mean it is there's some very silly things in there I've seen some of the videos on the YouTube channel that they have I believe it's OL Revolution some of the YouTubes they have up I have to admit I've been given an advance copy of the game but because I was out of town this weekend I didn't get a chance to check it out so sorry but I did watch the videos and just looking at some of the songs that are in it I'm face palming because they found shit that I did

15:00.422 --> 15:04.644
[SPEAKER_04]: Live, where I would sing along to songs because I was that bored.

15:05.024 --> 15:08.886
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what was funny back in 2002 when we were first learning how to broadcast.

15:09.246 --> 15:12.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody saved that shit and is now in this game.

15:12.528 --> 15:13.388
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how embarrassing.

15:13.408 --> 15:16.030
[SPEAKER_04]: And your karaoke.

15:16.050 --> 15:17.070
[SPEAKER_04]: Your old karaoke.

15:17.170 --> 15:18.291
[SPEAKER_04]: I should not be in karaoke.

15:18.311 --> 15:20.512
[SPEAKER_04]: God, if Like A Prayer showed up in there, I'm going to die.

15:20.552 --> 15:20.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

15:21.252 --> 15:21.472
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

15:22.813 --> 15:23.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

15:23.833 --> 15:24.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki is Like A Prayer in there.

15:25.233 --> 15:25.734
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it is.

15:25.754 --> 15:26.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck!

15:26.475 --> 15:27.376
[SPEAKER_10]: I found the video for it.

15:27.516 --> 15:27.877
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck!

15:28.117 --> 15:29.018
[SPEAKER_04]: Like seriously?

15:29.579 --> 15:31.843
[SPEAKER_04]: I should not be encouraging people to seek this out.

15:32.083 --> 15:32.584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

15:33.977 --> 15:36.800
[SPEAKER_13]: The time that you guys wanted to do the funny stuff again.

15:36.820 --> 15:39.462
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember we tried to get me to sing karaoke again?

15:39.963 --> 15:42.064
[SPEAKER_13]: So Oops I Did It Again is in there as well.

15:43.145 --> 15:43.446
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

15:44.226 --> 15:46.728
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm sure we all have a little bit of embarrassment in there.

15:46.849 --> 15:48.410
[SPEAKER_04]: But okay, whatever.

15:48.750 --> 15:51.633
[SPEAKER_04]: I can look past the silliness and the fact that you know what?

15:51.793 --> 15:56.317
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing it because somebody thought it was cool as dumb as it was.

15:57.058 --> 15:58.078
[SPEAKER_04]: And they made a game out of it.

15:58.098 --> 15:58.939
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's awesome.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.260
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's such like...

16:01.561 --> 16:14.605
[SPEAKER_04]: And as individuals who have been doing this for free for going on eight years now and not really seeing any money out of this, in fact, oftentimes losing a lot of money into this, that's like total reward right there.

16:14.685 --> 16:17.546
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys so much to the community and everybody that put that together.

16:18.046 --> 16:22.467
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand it is coming out Christmas Eve, so stay tuned, 12-24 of 09 to Orange Lounge Radio.

16:25.948 --> 16:28.009
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're putting the finishing touches on that right now.

16:28.369 --> 16:30.190
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much to the community for putting that together.

16:30.530 --> 16:31.811
[SPEAKER_04]: We might get some phone calls on that later.

16:31.851 --> 16:36.673
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I got to tell earlier in the show about one of the developers behind it is going to call in and tell us all about it.

16:37.013 --> 16:38.693
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we'll find out some more.

16:39.774 --> 16:42.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's all I have for housekeeping.

16:42.975 --> 16:43.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.

16:43.876 --> 16:47.937
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get into the news tonight, but first I want to talk about this.

16:49.918 --> 16:51.919
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this didn't make the show roll tonight because...

16:53.175 --> 16:57.456
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura and Loki really kind of did things because I was out this weekend.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.257
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks to everybody for picking up the slack because I wasn't here.

17:00.957 --> 17:08.499
[SPEAKER_04]: But I saw something on the internet literally in the 15 minutes I was home between the time I got back from LA and the time I came over to do Orange Lingerie tonight that pissed me off.

17:08.759 --> 17:11.659
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously I didn't make the short roll because the others didn't know about it.

17:11.959 --> 17:18.681
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to say something about it because I'm so angry at this that I have to say something about it.

17:20.072 --> 17:46.917
[SPEAKER_04]: and it has to do with something I actually saw on Kotaku but it's not Kotaku I'm mad at in fact I think they're great there's lots of great video game blogs out there that I check regularly as I'm sure most of you do and Kotaku's one of them and when I was home for a few minutes I checked the site in my reader and saw that they had just run a story about Out Magazine's Gayest Games Ever list or I think the actual name of the list is the Gayest Video Games that they've put together this list that is running on Out Magazine um

17:47.597 --> 17:54.264
[SPEAKER_04]: very little journalistic content to this nobody signed the article so I don't know who did it

17:55.545 --> 18:11.372
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you read it you can pretty much figure out why I really shouldn't be encouraging you to seek this out because this list is not only stupid but it's so stupid it's offensive I am offended by this article you want to know why?

18:11.812 --> 18:23.798
[SPEAKER_04]: listen to such gem excerpts such as this the gayest video games obviously I can't read the entire article because it's copyright but for purposes of criticism I can cite certain pieces of it

18:24.398 --> 18:26.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Brothers makes the list.

18:27.099 --> 18:31.800
[SPEAKER_04]: Which they put a video of Super Mario Brothers 3, but they describe Super Mario Brothers.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.861
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleaning pipes and taking names.

18:38.522 --> 18:38.902
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

18:39.122 --> 18:42.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Because cleaning pipes is like a euphemism for gay sex?

18:43.144 --> 18:43.864
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny.

18:46.496 --> 18:46.856
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

18:47.297 --> 18:47.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on with this.

18:48.097 --> 18:48.658
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra.

18:49.579 --> 18:54.143
[SPEAKER_04]: Two bare-chested dudes on a mission neither can accomplish without the other.

18:54.543 --> 18:59.868
[SPEAKER_04]: Widely thought to have influenced Annie Prolix before she penned this short story to Brokeback Mountain.

19:01.890 --> 19:02.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's so funny.

19:04.172 --> 19:08.436
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, Dan's beaten the game with one guy and no continues.

19:09.096 --> 19:09.817
[SPEAKER_10]: So, bullshit.

19:10.131 --> 19:10.331
[SPEAKER_04]: BurgerTime

19:23.936 --> 19:24.416
[SPEAKER_04]: What?!

19:24.697 --> 19:27.058
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, BurgerTime is apparently a gay video game.

19:27.739 --> 19:44.990
[SPEAKER_04]: The slap some meat between those buns tagline was jettisoned for the less memorable Let's Get Cooking, but this 1982 arcade title was created as a witty and fun commentary on the closeted state of male-to-male sexuality in the early 1980s.

19:45.730 --> 19:46.411
[SPEAKER_10]: No it wasn't.

19:47.271 --> 19:49.653
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about a fucking hamburger!

19:50.914 --> 19:51.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

19:51.274 --> 19:52.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

19:52.255 --> 19:52.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

19:53.732 --> 19:55.132
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

20:15.379 --> 20:26.182
[SPEAKER_04]: sets back what we've tried to accomplish by going back to these schoolyard tactics of, well, if X and Y is true, then teehee, you must be gay because so-and-so talks with a lisp.

20:26.422 --> 20:27.262
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a faggot.

20:27.983 --> 20:30.263
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how many times I had to hear that growing up?

20:30.783 --> 20:33.744
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you're doing in this magazine article, is that any better?

20:34.104 --> 20:37.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're bare-chested dudes going on an adventure together.

20:37.685 --> 20:40.126
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes this a gay video game.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.551
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I find that to be offensive.

20:44.071 --> 20:58.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowhere here in this article does it talk about Dragon Age, a game where you can have a same gender relationship if you want, or not, your choice, or how about what I consider to be one of the most landmark games for homosexual content ever made, The Sims.

21:00.052 --> 21:02.754
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to have a gay relationship, go for it.

21:03.215 --> 21:04.416
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't, don't.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.658
[SPEAKER_04]: What you do in your walls is your choice.

21:07.079 --> 21:08.540
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that game come up in this article?

21:09.001 --> 21:09.261
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

21:09.982 --> 21:15.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to some junior high school graduate here, it's apparently not funny.

21:15.948 --> 21:21.694
[SPEAKER_04]: But putting a list of games in a blender that are apparently popular and finding... It's like...

21:22.622 --> 21:23.382
[SPEAKER_04]: Jake Gyllenhaal must be gay

21:49.218 --> 21:56.505
[SPEAKER_04]: because he bottomed for Heath Ledger or he looks good without a shirt off or whatever reason they pick up.

21:57.246 --> 22:05.254
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that any better from what you've faced as a homosexual man or a bisexual man or somebody in the minority your entire life?

22:05.594 --> 22:07.877
[SPEAKER_04]: How is what you're saying any better than that?

22:08.477 --> 22:10.579
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you do one thing, you must be gay.

22:11.584 --> 22:12.744
[SPEAKER_04]: This list is stupid.

22:13.364 --> 22:16.225
[SPEAKER_04]: This list has nothing to do with gay people.

22:16.525 --> 22:18.185
[SPEAKER_04]: It has nothing to do with video games.

22:18.525 --> 22:20.606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insulting and I denounce it.

22:21.926 --> 22:33.888
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are a gay man listening to this show, which I've been blessed amongst the seven or eight years to meet many gay people that listen to this show and have said many nice things about what we do here and all that stuff, you should be fucking pissed too.

22:34.388 --> 22:40.709
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are a straight man who plays video games, you should be fucking pissed at this because they don't know what the hell they're talking about.

22:41.900 --> 23:07.359
[SPEAKER_04]: and Out Magazine if you want to write about video games then hire someone who knows what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to video games and has the balls to sign their articles and has the balls to sign their article and is going to sign a check that they're asking cash no pun intended it's just ridiculous I mean my god if Cho and Niki had been on the list at least I could see that I mean I would think that's a little stupid but come on

23:08.783 --> 23:10.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, Loki, am I crazy?

23:10.024 --> 23:11.004
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're not crazy.

23:11.665 --> 23:15.007
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that magazine, though, just for men, specifically?

23:15.107 --> 23:15.847
[SPEAKER_04]: Out magazine?

23:15.967 --> 23:16.287
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

23:16.367 --> 23:17.128
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't subscribe.

23:17.188 --> 23:22.471
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear it's been around forever, but clearly you can understand why I'm not going to subscribe to these types of magazines.

23:22.611 --> 23:25.433
[SPEAKER_10]: As a woman, I'm actually kind of offended by that, too.

23:26.293 --> 23:34.558
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Out is specifically targeted at gay men, but I'm sure they're not going to say no to a lesbian who wants to buy it.

23:36.218 --> 23:44.181
[SPEAKER_10]: I just... I think that that's completely baffling and silly that they could even pass something like that and think that it would be actually funny.

23:44.722 --> 23:50.064
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can't... Now, if the whole list is strictly for parody, it should say parody.

23:50.164 --> 23:52.825
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe it might be remotely funny.

23:53.826 --> 24:00.729
[SPEAKER_04]: It still would be about as funny as... It would be about as funny as World War II.

24:00.849 --> 24:01.549
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not funny.

24:01.949 --> 24:03.130
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to play devil's advocate.

24:03.190 --> 24:03.690
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

24:04.651 --> 24:09.512
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be the only thing that I could remotely see something like that maybe passing to be posted.

24:10.032 --> 24:17.634
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that they go, oh no, this is satire, this is parody, this is us making fun of other people by sort of the Colbert action, you know what I mean?

24:18.374 --> 24:20.955
[SPEAKER_10]: How he makes fun of Republicans by acting like an uber-Republican.

24:21.835 --> 24:26.176
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, if there's no type of disclaimer about that, then no.

24:26.556 --> 24:26.956
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that

24:27.791 --> 24:31.772
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, actually, I would say don't just post a comment on there.

24:31.993 --> 24:35.654
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, get their address and mail something in.

24:35.754 --> 24:36.394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see.

24:37.054 --> 24:38.255
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for sake, real quick.

24:38.335 --> 24:41.536
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're pushed for time tonight, but I just want to read what I said on the article.

24:41.756 --> 24:42.736
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you may not see this.

24:43.477 --> 24:45.377
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see this, then they let it run.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.798
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll post it up on our forums, too.

24:49.047 --> 24:54.551
[SPEAKER_04]: As a gay man and a long time gaming enthusiast, I find this meat compilation to be not only horribly misinformed but offensive.

24:54.992 --> 24:58.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowhere on this list are games mentioned that actually meant anything to gay representation in games.

24:59.175 --> 25:00.456
[SPEAKER_04]: Love who you want to love in The Sims.

25:00.736 --> 25:02.838
[SPEAKER_04]: Choose to have a same gender night of Passion and Dragon Age.

25:02.978 --> 25:03.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not.

25:03.658 --> 25:10.744
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even a freaking bone-tossed controversial gay content in games such as the hidden kiss in Bully or the lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect.

25:11.124 --> 25:11.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

25:40.501 --> 25:43.624
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm mad because I'm so disappointed.

25:44.324 --> 25:45.325
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so disappointed.

25:46.626 --> 26:01.018
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure whoever wrote this article, you know, assuming they're gay, hell, assuming they're straight working in a gay magazine at some point in their life has had a stereotype passed on to them and to just turn around and post this crap in the face of that is disappointing.

26:01.538 --> 26:03.180
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's so disappointing that I'm angry.

26:04.941 --> 26:08.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Out, do the right thing and renounce this article and apologize.

26:08.905 --> 26:09.325
[SPEAKER_04]: I demand it.

26:11.960 --> 26:17.702
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you demand it too, which you should, out.com and I don't know.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.303
[SPEAKER_04]: I could read the whole... Call for a boycott until you do.

26:20.063 --> 26:23.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to the website and tell someone you're pissed because I know I'm pissed.

26:24.986 --> 26:25.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

26:27.907 --> 26:29.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I will send this letter to the editor.

26:29.408 --> 26:29.688
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

26:29.728 --> 26:32.229
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf says in chat I would send this letter to the editor.

26:32.649 --> 26:33.209
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I should.

26:33.329 --> 26:33.669
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

26:34.490 --> 26:35.890
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens tomorrow.

26:36.230 --> 26:36.571
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember...

26:38.672 --> 26:50.818
[SPEAKER_10]: I think whether or not it's posted, you should still send it to the editor because keep in mind, what's one of the big things that I personally lead by is that if you don't bring something to the attention of someone who can do something about it, then it's just going to keep going on.

26:51.458 --> 26:51.978
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fair enough.

26:52.339 --> 26:52.859
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what I'll do.

26:53.339 --> 26:54.900
[SPEAKER_04]: I will write a letter to the editor.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.682
[SPEAKER_04]: If all of you who are just as pissed off as I am will write a letter to the editor too.

26:59.202 --> 27:01.803
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think you should write it despite everything, but I mean, I'll write one.

27:02.243 --> 27:03.824
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to encourage everyone.

27:04.485 --> 27:05.465
[SPEAKER_10]: No, everyone.

27:06.085 --> 27:06.526
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll write one.

27:07.086 --> 27:07.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

27:08.632 --> 27:16.948
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, then we have a cause This is a much more important cause than President Cat, might I add But President Cat's pretty damn important President Cat is pretty damn awesome

27:18.732 --> 27:19.232
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:50.114 --> 27:52.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra being an inspiration for Brokeback Mountain.

27:52.315 --> 27:52.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

27:53.455 --> 27:55.256
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, the book was written?

27:55.276 --> 28:00.979
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the book was probably written before that game ever came out.

28:01.039 --> 28:01.619
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

28:01.639 --> 28:02.339
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to find out.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.980
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it's just ridiculous.

28:05.220 --> 28:05.821
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridiculous.

28:06.821 --> 28:07.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely ridiculous.

28:07.982 --> 28:13.244
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I was in band and I played softball for a little while.

28:14.375 --> 28:15.336
[SPEAKER_04]: A question in the chat room.

28:15.356 --> 28:17.918
[SPEAKER_04]: What about bisexuals or pansexuals or asexuals?

28:18.398 --> 28:22.581
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who hates stereotypes should be offended by this article.

28:22.641 --> 28:28.365
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you hate bisexual stereotypes, you know, like bisexual are just bisexual because they're sluts.

28:28.745 --> 28:29.545
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a stereotype.

28:29.766 --> 28:30.966
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I get.

28:31.867 --> 28:33.588
[SPEAKER_04]: Asexuals are asexual because they can't get any.

28:33.808 --> 28:34.629
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a stereotype.

28:35.209 --> 28:38.073
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the stuff that I get.

28:38.233 --> 28:42.698
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm married, but I've had girlfriends in the past.

28:44.540 --> 28:46.562
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like, oh, you're married now, so you're not.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.044
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't change.

28:49.125 --> 28:51.067
[SPEAKER_10]: It just means I found someone I fell in love with.

28:51.307 --> 28:52.809
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't change anything.

28:54.451 --> 28:56.233
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm totally pissed off by that.

28:58.100 --> 28:58.781
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:11.736 --> 29:12.757
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:29.025 --> 29:29.225
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Loki?

29:55.296 --> 29:55.616
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

29:55.816 --> 29:57.137
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

29:57.657 --> 29:58.477
[SPEAKER_04]: He has meat.

29:58.697 --> 30:00.378
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was going to let you do gaming news.

30:00.398 --> 30:01.218
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to say it.

30:01.258 --> 30:01.958
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's fine.

30:01.978 --> 30:04.559
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just like, I didn't really have anything to contribute.

30:04.639 --> 30:06.060
[SPEAKER_13]: It's stupid.

30:06.360 --> 30:11.161
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw the article, you know, when I was looking for stories.

30:11.181 --> 30:12.762
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, eh, no list.

30:12.862 --> 30:13.042
[SPEAKER_13]: Boop.

30:13.322 --> 30:14.162
[SPEAKER_13]: Skipped right past it.

30:14.582 --> 30:15.863
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's pretty much, you know.

30:16.954 --> 30:18.195
[SPEAKER_04]: Real Gaming News Real Gaming News Real Gaming News

30:46.934 --> 30:52.779
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, let's start things off with Out Magazine's top gay games list.

30:52.839 --> 30:54.141
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh wait, no.

30:55.222 --> 31:07.112
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, as rumored and as we've been talking about before, the water expansion for LittleBigPlanet is going to be hitting the PlayStation Network before Christmas.

31:07.693 --> 31:12.997
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is coming out this week and to kind of tie with it, and I'm surprised I didn't think of it before...

31:14.144 --> 31:14.945
[SPEAKER_13]: Pirates of the Caribbean Level Pack

31:30.874 --> 31:49.579
[SPEAKER_13]: and those will be out on the PlayStation Network on the 22nd including with that will be a six pack of Pirates costumes including Jack Sparrow, Davy Jones, Will Turner and some of the other characters in the actual movie and also you get a free cannibal costume as well if you don't want to buy any of that stuff.

31:49.599 --> 31:54.300
[SPEAKER_13]: At the very least you get a free cannibal costume and I can't wait to buy this.

31:55.020 --> 31:59.522
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad after such a sad, angry news item that we have something that makes me happy again.

31:59.582 --> 32:03.744
[SPEAKER_04]: And this makes me happy that LittleBigPlanet is still getting some love all this time later.

32:03.764 --> 32:05.625
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this has been sprinkled throughout the past few shows.

32:05.985 --> 32:07.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it weird that this game's a year old?

32:07.566 --> 32:13.268
[SPEAKER_04]: And I seriously think LittleBigPlanet has come up every show for like the past month leading up to this, the release of this unpack.

32:13.288 --> 32:14.249
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's going to be awesome.

32:14.769 --> 32:18.691
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to see how water's going to change the game, especially in the fan levels.

32:18.951 --> 32:22.913
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't get me wrong, the Pirates levels are probably going to be awesome because the Metal Gear Solid levels...

32:23.533 --> 32:25.394
[SPEAKER_04]: That was some of the best bargain DLC.

32:25.895 --> 32:28.957
[SPEAKER_04]: It was almost like playing a new game for seven, eight bucks.

32:29.697 --> 32:31.258
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to see what this is going to bring.

32:31.659 --> 32:32.079
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely.

32:32.439 --> 32:35.221
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's going to be five pirate theme levels.

32:35.641 --> 32:40.324
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to have four new audio tracks in there, new backgrounds, and that kind of stuff.

32:41.245 --> 32:45.428
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just can't wait to play it.

32:45.448 --> 32:46.869
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, this week is going to be awesome.

32:48.910 --> 32:51.672
[SPEAKER_13]: To kind of go with that, real quick,

32:52.304 --> 32:55.126
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit LittleBigPlanet related, but not.

32:55.727 --> 33:00.690
[SPEAKER_13]: There was an advertisement for LittleBigPlanet accessories for the PSP.

33:01.431 --> 33:03.252
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is straight from Sony.

33:03.632 --> 33:10.898
[SPEAKER_13]: Funny thing about that is that advertisement lists the PSP 4000 on top of the PSP Go.

33:11.999 --> 33:12.939
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh.

33:13.680 --> 33:21.686
[SPEAKER_13]: So perhaps they're going to have another reiteration of the PSP coming out.

33:23.274 --> 33:24.035
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

33:43.689 --> 33:50.391
[SPEAKER_13]: Much like other Sony rumors, I'm going to say that probably we're going to hear about the PSP-4000 within the next few months.

33:50.931 --> 34:00.633
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really surprising to me because I would think with the Go, as much of a hard time as we've given it on this program, you'd think that if the company really believes in it, they're going to put all their might behind it.

34:00.933 --> 34:10.736
[SPEAKER_04]: But to kind of come out and say, oh, well, we're going to go back to the old design and the 4000, which implies by nature that it's like the 3000, but with some changes, just like all the other iterations before it.

34:12.556 --> 34:13.418
[SPEAKER_04]: and that they're going to go away.

34:14.299 --> 34:16.722
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, this sounds like it's going to be a UMD-enabled machine.

34:17.763 --> 34:17.943
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

34:19.906 --> 34:25.893
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't be surprised if it's just something simple like adding onboard storage, because that doesn't take up that much space.

34:26.794 --> 34:29.518
[SPEAKER_13]: And why they couldn't do that in the first place, you know...

34:30.416 --> 34:41.282
[SPEAKER_13]: or someone was theorizing that they may go the route where they're going to include a camera built in to compete with the DSi so that you can use the camera support since it does support the camera.

34:42.143 --> 34:47.286
[SPEAKER_13]: They just never have released a camera over here for the PSP even though it's built into our firmware.

34:48.803 --> 34:50.384
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading some comments from the chat room.

34:50.404 --> 34:53.247
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I want to say this about the water piece of LittleBigPlanet.

34:53.907 --> 34:56.729
[SPEAKER_04]: Ionotropic said, whoops, where was it?

34:56.830 --> 34:57.290
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw it.

34:57.310 --> 34:58.211
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something about the water.

34:58.231 --> 34:58.551
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

34:58.611 --> 34:59.732
[SPEAKER_04]: Water levels always suck.

34:59.812 --> 35:00.513
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not want.

35:01.894 --> 35:02.454
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

35:02.674 --> 35:05.697
[SPEAKER_04]: But think about what the water's going to do in the user-created levels.

35:05.797 --> 35:06.838
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's most exciting.

35:06.858 --> 35:10.220
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because water means free movement anywhere, right?

35:10.501 --> 35:11.401
[SPEAKER_04]: No jumping, whatever.

35:11.421 --> 35:12.822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free movement.

35:13.323 --> 35:16.485
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be very interesting for some of the user-created things, I think.

35:16.866 --> 35:17.406
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, though.

35:19.426 --> 35:22.308
[SPEAKER_04]: Toa Gak says in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com, 4,000?

35:23.269 --> 35:25.090
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to remove features again?

35:25.390 --> 35:27.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the 3,000 lost a feature, the infrared port.

35:28.132 --> 35:30.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the Go lost the UMD, so what's this going to lose?

35:30.894 --> 35:33.916
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the infrared port I can understand because they didn't use it for anything.

35:34.617 --> 35:40.461
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, other than homebrew, which enabled use of it, but it didn't really use it for anything.

35:40.501 --> 35:43.643
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they were going to possibly use it for a keyboard or something, but never did.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.553
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what the PSP 4000 will do.

35:46.093 --> 35:48.535
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to finally stop piracy for good.

35:49.136 --> 35:50.497
[SPEAKER_04]: No, for real this time, guys.

35:50.717 --> 35:52.098
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't laugh, don't laugh, come on, for real.

35:52.138 --> 35:55.661
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to stop piracy and homebrew on the PSP for good.

35:55.761 --> 35:56.662
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the 4000 is all about.

35:56.682 --> 36:08.493
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome that you're going to do that, except that there's all these other versions of the PSP out there that people can still pirate on, and why would they buy a new system that's not going to be able to do what they want to do?

36:08.953 --> 36:09.414
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like...

36:10.536 --> 36:19.919
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd be the equivalent of them making new currency that has all these counterfeiting preventive measures built into it, but we're going to accept the old currency too.

36:20.299 --> 36:22.420
[SPEAKER_13]: Then why would you try to counterfeit the new currency?

36:22.460 --> 36:24.000
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just going to counterfeit the old one.

36:24.520 --> 36:25.141
[SPEAKER_13]: It's stupid.

36:25.481 --> 36:26.681
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this comment in our chatroom.

36:26.721 --> 36:29.442
[SPEAKER_04]: Joshi16 says, when will the PSP become over 9,000?

36:29.682 --> 36:33.503
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fair question.

36:33.523 --> 36:34.564
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe another five years.

36:34.604 --> 36:35.544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fair question.

36:36.826 --> 36:38.507
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, moving on to other Sony news.

36:38.807 --> 36:48.150
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a report out there that apparently there's a survey from an online research company that has been sent out that apparently is looking at interest in a premium subscription to PSN.

36:49.111 --> 36:54.293
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Sony's kind of thinking about, you know, if they ask for membership fees, they could do some extra goodies and so forth.

36:54.593 --> 37:03.056
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, hour-long trials for full PS3 titles, access to PS1 classics and cross-game voice chat, etc.

37:04.606 --> 37:09.368
[SPEAKER_04]: which apparently is still not, I always thought that was kind of there in PS3 games, but apparently it is still not there.

37:10.969 --> 37:22.634
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, also something called Cloud Storage, which, you know, is similar to what we have with Steam Cloud, which basically could be an online space where you can store saved data and then you can pull your saved games from this cloud.

37:22.975 --> 37:26.456
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, this is very good for when you're going over to friends' houses and so forth.

37:27.317 --> 37:32.279
[SPEAKER_04]: The survey also drops hints that they're thinking about things like streaming Netflix without a disc.

37:32.299 --> 37:32.739
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

37:32.779 --> 37:36.943
[SPEAKER_04]: Hulu support, free access to minis, premium things, and so forth.

37:37.303 --> 37:40.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I would not read too much into these types of surveys.

37:40.707 --> 37:41.948
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, surveys are surveys.

37:42.288 --> 37:47.353
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gauging interest, and they're going to throw all sorts of possibilities out there that might not have been thought up by Sony.

37:47.493 --> 37:49.375
[SPEAKER_04]: They might have been thought up by the marketing company.

37:49.875 --> 37:55.300
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's that old corporate mentality of, let's throw things against the wall and see what sticks.

37:56.181 --> 38:00.705
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it's not to say that nothing here is ever going to come true.

38:01.145 --> 38:06.209
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone with power is thinking about it, but I don't think there's need to flail and panic just yet.

38:07.691 --> 38:09.232
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, DarkSakura, what do you think?

38:10.093 --> 38:10.413
[SPEAKER_13]: Agree?

38:10.493 --> 38:10.873
[SPEAKER_13]: Disagree?

38:10.913 --> 38:15.257
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of it will probably come true because all the Sony rumors seem to come true sooner or later.

38:16.158 --> 38:17.299
[SPEAKER_10]: They have laser getting leaked.

38:18.490 --> 38:18.570
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

38:18.590 --> 38:18.690
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

38:43.379 --> 38:44.740
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

39:07.352 --> 39:11.594
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess then at the same time, you can play games for free on Sony's network, and you can't do that on Xbox.

39:11.614 --> 39:14.576
[SPEAKER_04]: So what might be considered a core feature one system might not be for another.

39:14.716 --> 39:15.096
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

39:15.236 --> 39:24.141
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think a lot of the problems with the Sony system is that they don't have their own network.

39:24.341 --> 39:28.043
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, they have their own network, but they don't have their dedicated servers, basically.

39:28.103 --> 39:36.328
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just all... Each company has their own servers for PlayStation games, since everything on Xbox Live is basically on the Microsoft servers.

39:37.315 --> 39:44.840
[SPEAKER_13]: Cross chat, cross servers is going to be tough because, you know, it's all these different servers you have to go through.

39:44.900 --> 39:46.501
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't know.

39:46.521 --> 39:48.662
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess they could do it if they really wanted to.

39:49.747 --> 39:52.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the chat room for some other comments on this story.

39:52.468 --> 39:58.469
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru in our chat room says, Doesn't Sony realize that their free service is the only advantage PSN has over Xbox Live?

39:59.549 --> 40:01.830
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Tyrant says, I really enjoy Core, to be honest.

40:01.970 --> 40:03.150
[SPEAKER_04]: I heart Veronica Belmont.

40:03.931 --> 40:05.331
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of Core fans out there.

40:05.551 --> 40:09.312
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I personally don't subscribe, but I don't think it's a...

40:09.912 --> 40:10.412
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

40:37.185 --> 40:39.907
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, we have some news regarding SingStar.

40:40.507 --> 40:41.008
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite.

40:42.248 --> 40:43.589
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, of course, I gave you ABBA.

40:45.150 --> 40:48.713
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a SingStar viewer application to be released.

40:49.193 --> 40:56.738
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it doesn't have a date yet, but to be coming out for PS3 that has a different social networking.

40:58.319 --> 40:58.880
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do...

41:00.846 --> 41:02.548
[SPEAKER_10]: and different things with the players.

41:02.648 --> 41:06.991
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually called SingStar Viewer, like I said, which would be in your games folder.

41:08.232 --> 41:10.354
[SPEAKER_10]: You can browse and purchase songs from the SingStore.

41:10.534 --> 41:15.958
[SPEAKER_10]: You can vote on videos and photos and rate stuff and it's supposed to be free.

41:17.279 --> 41:21.923
[SPEAKER_10]: And you also should be able to use it even when you do not have the SingStar disc in the system.

41:23.484 --> 41:28.468
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, not a date yet on it, but it says that it should be in the coming weeks.

41:30.524 --> 41:31.045
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41:53.407 --> 41:55.048
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

42:17.526 --> 42:27.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess, you know, and it's also kind of one of those things where I think that's where it ultimately might help drive sales is that people download this and go, oh, this is really funny, but I can do better.

42:28.018 --> 42:35.507
[SPEAKER_04]: My nephew can sing better than this kid, or I got an outfit that outdoes this one, so they're going to go buy the game so they can get on the SingStar channel.

42:35.647 --> 42:36.308
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

42:36.889 --> 42:37.009
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

42:38.163 --> 42:44.444
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly a selling point of the game that Lips doesn't have, or Karaoke Revolution doesn't have, or hell, even Rock Band doesn't have this.

42:45.005 --> 42:47.185
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't save your performances from Rock Band.

42:47.425 --> 42:51.386
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you imagine... Oh god, maybe this is something they're going to cook up for Rock Band 3.

42:52.746 --> 42:54.127
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow, I think I might be onto something.

42:54.807 --> 42:57.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially in this whole thing that we're getting into.

42:57.647 --> 43:00.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine if Rock Band 3 had this type of...

43:02.055 --> 43:02.876
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that might be it.

43:03.076 --> 43:04.277
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet that's where they're going to go with this.

43:04.698 --> 43:08.682
[SPEAKER_04]: Some type of share your performance on the internet type thing.

43:09.062 --> 43:09.783
[SPEAKER_10]: SingStar Idol?

43:10.003 --> 43:11.765
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing it the other way right now, aren't they?

43:12.205 --> 43:16.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Where if you're a band, put your song in Rock Band for the masses to consume.

43:17.610 --> 43:19.672
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, I bet that's what's coming in Rock Band 3.

43:20.313 --> 43:21.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Share your performance with the internet.

43:21.895 --> 43:22.255
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch!

43:22.916 --> 43:23.236
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch!

43:26.609 --> 43:33.895
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, SingStar's got the leg up on it, but I wonder, if this thing is successful, only a matter of time before the other music games notice.

43:36.296 --> 43:41.781
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, if there was a Rock Band 3 with internet connectivity, would you consider uploading some of your epic performances to it?

43:42.321 --> 43:43.762
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really played it that much, sadly.

43:43.782 --> 43:44.042
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

43:44.683 --> 43:44.983
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

43:45.243 --> 43:45.844
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

43:45.924 --> 43:47.925
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to see you doing the Timmy song.

43:49.826 --> 43:50.707
[SPEAKER_04]: Lords of the Underworld.

43:51.147 --> 43:51.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

43:52.929 --> 43:54.610
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

43:56.168 --> 44:04.594
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, another thing that you can kind of share in would be the new Sodium-1, which is kind of an MMO, I guess, on home.

44:05.014 --> 44:05.355
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

44:05.475 --> 44:08.537
[SPEAKER_13]: I apparently ignored the whole MMO part of it because...

44:09.158 --> 44:10.458
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually checked it out a little bit.

44:11.659 --> 44:16.219
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a self-contained social MMO, they're calling it, within PlayStation Home.

44:17.080 --> 44:21.620
[SPEAKER_13]: And you kind of go through this teleporter that's in the Central Plaza.

44:22.341 --> 44:25.561
[SPEAKER_13]: And you go in there and talk to this AI chick called Vicky.

44:26.381 --> 44:29.302
[SPEAKER_13]: And she gives you different mini-games and whatnot that you can play.

44:30.362 --> 44:33.503
[SPEAKER_13]: Including some different objective-based meta-games.

44:34.003 --> 44:38.804
[SPEAKER_13]: And they also have a full arcade-style game to play as well called the Assault Shooter.

44:39.844 --> 45:09.316
[SPEAKER_04]: which I thought was kind of fun but I think as you were saying it's a little bit like Battlezone I think the old Atari game I feel like I've played a game like it on the PC back when I had a 386 and I don't remember what the game was but it was one of those things that you would call up on the modem and play like oh man I distinctly remember a game it was very popular too it was the wire graphics like Battlezone but it was this whole type of thing where you were out in a field and you would shoot tanks you know like I want to say I've played this game before you know

45:10.516 --> 45:35.591
[SPEAKER_13]: um and then of course you get different unlocks for you know leveling up in the game apparently the uh salt shooter game that's in there only five levels are available in the game for free and you have to buy more um uh or i guess uh yeah more levels and items are unlockable through micro transactions yeah i think i would have played it up to about level five i played it only through level three before i got you know tired of doing it because i was working on some other stuff um

45:36.849 --> 45:38.210
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:00.942 --> 46:04.864
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the drink-making game, that was kind of multiplayer.

46:04.904 --> 46:07.426
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you play as the bartender, someone else is calling the drinks.

46:07.806 --> 46:09.988
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're ordering the drinks, someone else has to play the bartender.

46:10.408 --> 46:12.229
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, there's, I guess, that.

46:12.269 --> 46:13.170
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a bit of a stretch.

46:13.190 --> 46:14.811
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'd call it an MMO.

46:15.011 --> 46:19.714
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I thought was interesting about this is the way it kind of fit into the context of home.

46:20.214 --> 46:26.738
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and it kind of showed off these features of home that I didn't realize were there, such as the ability to interact with what's on the web.

46:27.158 --> 46:29.800
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to the website, SodiumOne.com, I think it is,

46:30.180 --> 46:34.724
[SPEAKER_04]: and you actually put in your PlayStation ID and all this stuff, it tracks your mini achievements.

46:34.925 --> 46:37.627
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're not actual trophies, but they're like achievements within Sodium.

46:37.967 --> 46:39.169
[SPEAKER_04]: It tracks them on the website.

46:39.669 --> 46:40.690
[SPEAKER_04]: It tracks your high scores.

46:41.070 --> 46:43.152
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Facebook app that you can use.

46:43.192 --> 46:52.101
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, it's just going to... I enabled it, but I didn't enable it to publish it on my wall because I knew every time I did something in the game, all my friends would have to see it and I didn't want to burden people with that.

46:53.422 --> 46:54.944
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does have that connectivity.

46:55.444 --> 46:56.165
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:13.328 --> 47:27.233
[SPEAKER_04]: I also thought it was interesting that you could, you know, the points that you earn in the game could go towards unlocking stuff in the home that you could put, like, if you go to the OLR Clubhouse now, there's a new table, there's some new seats, and a new little statue.

47:27.393 --> 47:29.434
[SPEAKER_04]: I got all that in the Sodium One thing.

47:29.854 --> 47:30.334
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and...

47:30.694 --> 47:31.514
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:53.120 --> 47:57.763
[SPEAKER_04]: This really feels like what Home was advertised as a year and a half ago.

47:58.464 --> 48:02.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Games and social interaction working seamlessly together.

48:02.766 --> 48:11.372
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a bummer that I feel like the game I'm playing here I played back in 1996 on a modem on my PC, but okay, it's a step forward.

48:12.333 --> 48:13.994
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

48:14.074 --> 48:15.895
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a neat game, but it's just like...

48:17.523 --> 48:18.364
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

48:35.805 --> 48:39.427
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we still don't have our trophy room with our trophies in it.

48:39.848 --> 48:41.669
[SPEAKER_04]: So what else do we have to look forward to at home?

48:41.829 --> 48:46.832
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the game integration and the way that it's going to integrate with the rest of the PlayStation brand.

48:47.172 --> 48:49.053
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see this as a step forward.

48:49.173 --> 48:52.155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big step forward, but it was neat.

48:52.495 --> 48:53.636
[SPEAKER_04]: I was entertained for an hour.

48:54.497 --> 48:54.957
[SPEAKER_04]: For free.

48:55.277 --> 49:01.141
[SPEAKER_13]: I did get the water still as my creepy Santa Claus, which this time of year is very relevant.

49:01.201 --> 49:01.461
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

49:03.916 --> 49:08.840
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the dollies just passed out from excitement apparently over the snooze.

49:09.561 --> 49:09.841
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.

49:10.622 --> 49:12.343
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't have a very stable place to put her.

49:12.643 --> 49:12.883
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

49:14.594 --> 49:17.535
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, I don't know.

49:17.755 --> 49:19.256
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see where this leads in 2010.

49:19.316 --> 49:20.636
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

49:21.296 --> 49:23.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks in chat are asking about the OLR Clubhouse.

49:23.517 --> 49:25.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, on Sony Home we have an OLR Clubhouse.

49:25.818 --> 49:26.938
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be full.

49:27.258 --> 49:28.639
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have 25 members in it now.

49:28.659 --> 49:30.640
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't even joined yet and it's full already.

49:30.720 --> 49:30.920
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

49:31.460 --> 49:31.760
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

49:31.780 --> 49:33.901
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to send a request to...

49:34.986 --> 49:35.807
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

49:53.109 --> 49:53.429
[SPEAKER_04]: Outro Music

50:20.765 --> 50:22.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathwishing is saying requests.

50:22.787 --> 50:28.190
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I approved all the pending requests, so I will go in tonight and make sure it's all approved.

50:29.491 --> 50:30.952
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's full, I don't know what to tell you.

50:30.992 --> 50:31.613
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be screwed.

50:31.653 --> 50:32.013
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

50:33.014 --> 50:34.775
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least you'll have this to look forward to.

50:35.135 --> 50:36.476
[SPEAKER_04]: Something on PBS.

50:37.096 --> 50:39.718
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, PBS, the public broadcast system.

50:40.339 --> 50:42.480
[SPEAKER_04]: Most popularly known maybe for the Lawrence Welk show.

50:42.580 --> 50:43.180
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

50:43.701 --> 50:44.761
[SPEAKER_11]: Reading Rainbow, Rob.

50:44.902 --> 50:46.202
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Sesame Street.

50:46.242 --> 50:46.863
[SPEAKER_11]: Doctor Who.

50:47.143 --> 50:47.583
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

50:47.643 --> 50:48.324
[SPEAKER_11]: Early Doctor Who.

50:48.624 --> 50:50.025
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of great British imports.

50:50.045 --> 50:51.346
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Dwarf.

50:51.366 --> 50:52.948
[SPEAKER_04]: The public broadcasting system.

50:53.448 --> 50:55.850
[SPEAKER_04]: All kidding aside, you know the types of stuff they show on here.

50:55.870 --> 50:56.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Masterpiece Theater.

50:57.011 --> 51:03.736
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times, a lot of orchestral concerts and a lot of things you would see at an opera house and so forth.

51:04.077 --> 51:10.902
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might surprise you to know that PBS is planning to record and air video games live in 2010.

51:10.962 --> 51:12.163
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

51:12.263 --> 51:15.246
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing that was kind of meant to bridge that gap...

51:15.686 --> 51:16.587
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

51:29.793 --> 51:31.394
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51:50.609 --> 52:15.483
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently also a DVD and Blu-ray because PBS puts out a lot of their programming on DVD Blu-ray to kind of raise money for the stations because you know they're all publicly funded and so forth so you know sales from those will go to help fund PBS so that's kind of cool for those that were looking to you know especially if you live in a place that doesn't get video games live coming there although they've gone to a lot of places you'll have an opportunity to see the show so that's pretty cool

52:16.997 --> 52:19.358
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to dress, though, dress to impress because you might be on TV.

52:19.999 --> 52:20.779
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something to think about.

52:21.440 --> 52:23.061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, TigerClaw on chat says, that would be cool.

52:23.101 --> 52:24.321
[SPEAKER_04]: I get PBS and HD.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.663
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, you know, considering we're talking Blu-ray and PBS.

52:28.204 --> 52:31.425
[SPEAKER_04]: PBS was like the first channel I remember seeing going HD.

52:31.465 --> 52:35.668
[SPEAKER_04]: I think PBS was in HD long before NBC and the other folks got on board.

52:35.768 --> 52:37.629
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to look good.

52:38.029 --> 52:38.730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to look good.

52:38.870 --> 52:41.771
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get to see all of Tommy's outfit changes in high definition.

52:41.811 --> 52:42.712
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be quite impressive.

52:44.955 --> 52:45.475
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:10.735 --> 53:11.576
[SPEAKER_10]: It is for adults.

53:11.636 --> 53:12.778
[SPEAKER_10]: It is bloody and frightening.

53:12.958 --> 53:13.959
[SPEAKER_10]: That was our intent.

53:14.900 --> 53:26.834
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically they're saying that they're going to leave it to the reasonable expectations of adults to, you know, whether or not they want to get the game or not.

53:27.222 --> 53:42.073
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to remember talking about this in a previous episode and the fact that the bankers behind that game are very cold and unwilling to budge on this is that we made this game and we are not changing it and if you are not a responsible enough adult to play it, then don't play it.

53:42.113 --> 53:44.816
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not changing it because you can't handle it.

53:46.277 --> 53:47.177
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admire it.

53:48.739 --> 53:52.682
[SPEAKER_04]: They might go down in flames, but I have to admire them not wanting to budge.

53:52.802 --> 53:54.923
[SPEAKER_10]: Stick to them guns and make them some integrity.

53:55.163 --> 53:56.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold star for all of you kids.

53:56.264 --> 53:56.985
[SPEAKER_10]: No selling out.

53:58.553 --> 54:00.936
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think other places have sold out, Rob?

54:02.017 --> 54:04.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Like other game companies?

54:04.961 --> 54:11.488
[SPEAKER_04]: One could claim that Valve and so forth sold out when they made those changes to get the game released in Australia and so forth.

54:12.109 --> 54:14.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, let me say this and then I'll go on the tangent.

54:16.545 --> 54:23.331
[SPEAKER_04]: is that, you know, but I don't know if that was so much selling out as it was, you know, they did what they had to do to release the game.

54:23.771 --> 54:26.353
[SPEAKER_04]: People in movies do this all the time.

54:26.794 --> 54:33.339
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you think these guys are bad in the other countries, look at what they do right here in America with the Motion Picture Association.

54:34.440 --> 54:43.287
[SPEAKER_04]: Heaven forbid you show a vagina or a penis in your movie or you're going to get smacked with an NC-17 rating and no theater house in America is going to show your movie.

54:43.307 --> 54:44.929
[SPEAKER_10]: Life of Brian does not have an NC-17 rating.

54:45.822 --> 54:46.702
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's got full frontal.

54:46.903 --> 54:51.445
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also a lot older, I think, when movies were fitting into the X category.

54:52.125 --> 54:58.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it might have still been R. I don't think that it... It was R. For some reason in the 70s, like Porky's and a lot of these movies somehow got under the radar.

54:58.909 --> 55:00.770
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, in this day and age, let's face it.

55:01.210 --> 55:04.291
[SPEAKER_04]: A movie like Showgirls got a rating like NC-17.

55:04.572 --> 55:07.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Not because it was bad, but because it had a lot of tits and ass.

55:08.193 --> 55:09.274
[SPEAKER_04]: But heaven forbid...

55:10.839 --> 55:11.760
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the same thing.

55:28.418 --> 55:37.525
[SPEAKER_04]: and directors and so forth change their movies all the time to get down to the R rating because they know if they release it with an NC-17 rating, they're screwed.

55:37.585 --> 55:39.026
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll never make the money back on the movie.

55:39.066 --> 55:40.688
[SPEAKER_04]: The studios force them to do it.

55:40.728 --> 55:43.270
[SPEAKER_04]: They are contractually obliged to deliver a certain rating.

55:44.390 --> 55:51.436
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while you get those indie studios that are like, if you were releasing our unrated movie, once in a while you see those slip through the cracks, but unfortunately they don't make money.

55:52.617 --> 55:55.058
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you get the unrated version for a home release.

55:55.419 --> 55:55.579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

55:58.084 --> 56:24.762
[SPEAKER_04]: and some folks in chat are saying X movie has full frontal and Y movie has full frontal okay yeah okay fine you know you can show a little peen and a little vag and get away with it but you know usually you have to appeal it to get the rating and let's face it you and I you the listener and I the host can agree that the standards between violence and nudity are way different come on you can't show you can't show penetration in a movie but you can show a bullet going through someone's brain

56:25.563 --> 56:26.684
[SPEAKER_04]: You can show that penetration.

56:29.046 --> 56:29.487
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

56:31.608 --> 56:36.813
[SPEAKER_13]: What if you fired a penis instead of a bullet and it penetrated instead of their head or vagina?

56:37.033 --> 56:38.855
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that still count if it's fired from a gun?

56:39.035 --> 56:39.756
[SPEAKER_04]: NC-17.

56:39.816 --> 56:41.337
[SPEAKER_04]: A cum shot is always going to get you NC-17.

56:41.357 --> 56:41.477
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.

56:43.996 --> 56:44.977
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

57:01.601 --> 57:02.742
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57:28.573 --> 57:38.595
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have to say he made a pretty damn good movie I wouldn't say you should see it if you're under 17 but if you are of age I really liked that movie I thought it was a great movie too

57:40.144 --> 57:43.426
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that the lady in it was in Hedwig.

57:44.607 --> 57:46.508
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Poppin' Chat brings up a good point.

57:46.788 --> 57:49.230
[SPEAKER_04]: They did that in Scary Movie 2, Dick in the Head.

57:49.730 --> 57:50.530
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that.

57:51.351 --> 57:51.751
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true.

57:51.951 --> 57:53.172
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't see balls, though.

57:53.933 --> 57:56.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's not penis people have a problem with, it's balls.

57:57.275 --> 57:58.095
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like breasts.

57:58.515 --> 58:01.217
[SPEAKER_13]: The breast is okay, but the nipple, oh my god, no.

58:03.004 --> 58:03.224
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

58:03.765 --> 58:06.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move around the country and cover some release dates.

58:07.147 --> 58:08.108
[SPEAKER_04]: Things that are okay.

58:08.268 --> 58:09.449
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

58:09.830 --> 58:10.991
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot a tangent.

58:11.231 --> 58:15.815
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of our folks that works for Orange Lingerie would want me to say something about this on air.

58:15.875 --> 58:18.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Deekman, because he posted this to the Twitter earlier this week.

58:18.757 --> 58:24.302
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear about the Australian censorship and the fact that they are looking at – and I don't know if this is somebody running with us.

58:24.622 --> 58:31.808
[SPEAKER_04]: They are looking at installing basically China-like restrictions on their internet and filtering out objectionable sites, quote.

58:32.944 --> 58:36.126
[SPEAKER_13]: This is really going to hurt your tough man edge, Australia.

58:36.186 --> 58:41.789
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, seriously, it was all about, you know, crocodile hunters and beer drinking and kangaroos over there.

58:41.989 --> 58:43.430
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not an internet.

58:43.891 --> 58:45.632
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't forget the transvestites.

58:46.832 --> 58:50.975
[SPEAKER_13]: But now it's just like, you know, censored internet.

58:51.595 --> 58:54.117
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that just got misconstrued.

58:54.637 --> 58:55.478
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope.

58:55.498 --> 58:57.699
[SPEAKER_04]: And Deekman posted it to our Twitter.

58:58.199 --> 58:59.120
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little disheartening.

59:00.430 --> 59:09.018
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that any type of censorship is... The only people who I think should be allowed to censor are parents and people censoring themselves.

59:09.653 --> 59:15.637
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I'm not mistaking, Australia has a parliament-style government, which means they do have elected officials.

59:15.997 --> 59:22.061
[SPEAKER_04]: So Australians, if you're listening and you disagree with this, vote your politicians the fuck out of office immediately.

59:22.541 --> 59:24.943
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless, of course, they were the politicians that were against this.

59:25.323 --> 59:32.328
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe in your country, you do vote, and you vote these people the fuck out that are trying to do this.

59:33.976 --> 59:36.597
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to happier topics.

59:36.657 --> 59:38.217
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of angst tonight.

59:38.577 --> 59:41.718
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear I'm actually in a really good mood, all things considered.

59:42.739 --> 59:44.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is pretty good right now.

59:44.799 --> 59:47.900
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't complain, so I don't know why we're having such an angsty show tonight.

59:49.240 --> 59:50.841
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR, quit trying to bring me down.

59:52.571 --> 59:55.953
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, not much coming out this week in the U.S., mainly three games.

59:56.193 --> 01:00:01.555
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

01:00:01.595 --> 01:00:07.118
[SPEAKER_13]: That is, of course, if you didn't get it free with Guitar Hero 5 during the month of September.

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:27.748
[SPEAKER_13]: Twin Sector being released on PC and finally on the Wii we have Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bears coming out on the Wii the first real good Wii Final Fantasy game That's the one that they've been advertising ever since the damn thing launched, right?

01:00:28.108 --> 01:00:29.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, that would be the one

01:00:31.536 --> 01:00:32.297
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not one of them.

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:50.218
[SPEAKER_04]: So now things are dying down a little bit there, but that's not to say there's nothing coming out.

01:00:50.278 --> 01:00:59.762
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360 is getting a price reduction this week in Japan, as well as Infernal Hell's Vengeance is a new game coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.

01:01:00.382 --> 01:01:05.545
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 3, it sounds like a new Hori arcade stick is coming out, but that is really it.

01:01:05.565 --> 01:01:11.948
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no new releases on the particular system, which, considering the games usually come out Friday over there, and Friday is Christmas Eve...

01:01:13.168 --> 01:01:14.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to really see a whole lot, probably.

01:01:15.469 --> 01:01:17.009
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Wii, same story.

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:19.490
[SPEAKER_04]: Going over to the PlayStation 2.

01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:24.472
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a Neo Geo Online Collection Complete Box Volumes 1 and 2.

01:01:24.872 --> 01:01:26.273
[SPEAKER_04]: That is something new coming out over there.

01:01:26.973 --> 01:01:28.974
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, that's just rehashed old stuff.

01:01:29.834 --> 01:01:35.276
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the Nintendo DS, Zelda no Densetsu Taiyou no Kiteki.

01:01:35.636 --> 01:01:37.577
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to guess what that is on the Nintendo DS?

01:01:37.737 --> 01:01:38.757
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say the train game.

01:01:38.857 --> 01:01:39.337
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

01:01:39.357 --> 01:01:40.418
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid candle won't light.

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:05.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, and I got my days mixed up.

01:02:05.106 --> 01:02:06.667
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says Thursday is Christmas Eve.

01:02:06.727 --> 01:02:07.987
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Friday is Christmas Day.

01:02:08.167 --> 01:02:09.428
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry.

01:02:09.988 --> 01:02:11.748
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, who keeps up with Christmas anymore?

01:02:11.868 --> 01:02:15.810
[SPEAKER_04]: The releases are getting all messed up because of the holidays anyway.

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:21.471
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's pretty much dry in the UK.

01:02:21.831 --> 01:02:23.632
[SPEAKER_10]: Just one game on the 22nd.

01:02:23.992 --> 01:02:26.693
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, one game came out today, Nicky Rock'n'Ball.

01:02:27.393 --> 01:02:30.034
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I should say yesterday now for them because it's the 20th already.

01:02:31.724 --> 01:02:34.928
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 22nd is Savage Moon, the Hera campaign on PSP.

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:37.751
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about it.

01:02:52.562 --> 01:03:04.371
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking about Final Fantasy XIII, it did pretty well this week, including 1 million copies sold within, I believe, the first 24 hours.

01:03:04.511 --> 01:03:04.751
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

01:03:05.292 --> 01:03:05.472
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

01:03:05.492 --> 01:03:06.513
[SPEAKER_13]: Over 2 million copies sold.

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:10.776
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they shipped 2 million, so probably between 1 and 2 million copies sold.

01:03:12.257 --> 01:03:19.482
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, that includes the Lightning Edition PS3 with the silkscreen pink...

01:03:21.803 --> 01:03:22.545
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:03:28.433 --> 01:03:33.296
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically the equivalent of a Modern Warfare 2 here, which sold what?

01:03:33.336 --> 01:03:37.759
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they say it sold like 7 million in the first week or some huge amount?

01:03:37.919 --> 01:03:40.000
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 sold millions.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:45.644
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of the equivalent over there, which surprises probably no one.

01:03:47.005 --> 01:03:51.928
[SPEAKER_04]: But the real question is, what will happen when the game comes out here?

01:03:52.068 --> 01:03:53.849
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it move a million in one night here?

01:03:53.969 --> 01:03:54.610
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it will.

01:03:55.772 --> 01:03:56.673
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:04:13.132 --> 01:04:16.975
[SPEAKER_04]: Squeenix is now accepting beta applications for Final Fantasy XIV.

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:21.058
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're skipping Final Fantasy XIII, maybe you are looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.

01:04:21.378 --> 01:04:24.701
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, the applications are now open for the Final Fantasy XIV beta.

01:04:25.021 --> 01:04:26.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Please note, this is only the Windows edition.

01:04:26.983 --> 01:04:35.369
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not doing, it looks like, what they did on the PlayStation 2 for Final Fantasy XI, where they actually were shipping hard drives to people to beta test that, and they could keep them as a thank you gift.

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:36.990
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-uh, not the case here.

01:04:37.471 --> 01:04:40.253
[SPEAKER_04]: You will have to sign up for only the Windows version, at least for right now.

01:04:40.433 --> 01:04:45.117
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't know if I'm honestly, I hardly have time to play World of Warcraft and Star Trek Online's coming out

01:05:10.077 --> 01:05:11.178
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm in the same boat.

01:05:11.218 --> 01:05:16.544
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, I will push World of Warcraft to the side for a little while to focus on this if it's good.

01:05:16.924 --> 01:05:23.151
[SPEAKER_04]: If they've learned from their mistakes from XI, which I still think XI was a solid game for its time, it just didn't age well.

01:05:23.231 --> 01:05:30.899
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if they really have combined the best parts of that with the best parts of World of Warcraft, this game could be pretty awesome.

01:05:31.239 --> 01:05:32.501
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to check it out.

01:05:33.877 --> 01:05:38.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow though, just so you know, you need to be 18 years old in order to apply.

01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:48.110
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be fluent in English, which if you're listening to this show, I'm assuming you are, or you could be fluent in Japanese, French, or German, because I know we do have some listeners in Japan and even some of those other countries there.

01:05:49.391 --> 01:05:54.636
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently though, a PS3 one will come out later, it's just that right now you can only sign up for the PC version.

01:05:55.336 --> 01:06:19.015
[SPEAKER_04]: also no MMORPG experience required but I will tell you since I did sign up be prepared to fill out a little bit of a questionnaire about your gaming experience which is translated from a Japanese version you can kind of tell but yeah let us know if any of you OLR people get in let me know so I can be jealous especially if I don't get in this would use my play online ID right?

01:06:19.095 --> 01:06:21.898
[SPEAKER_04]: no it doesn't I think they're going away from play online

01:06:22.642 --> 01:06:23.202
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:06:50.421 --> 01:06:51.021
[SPEAKER_04]: Great pick.

01:06:51.061 --> 01:06:52.261
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have the music here shortly.

01:06:52.462 --> 01:06:54.862
[SPEAKER_04]: Firefox had to reboot, so I'll get the music here in a moment.

01:06:55.482 --> 01:07:06.385
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the game originally came out in Japan in 1987 for the Famicom Disk System, as did the third one, too.

01:07:08.486 --> 01:07:09.706
[SPEAKER_10]: It came out in the U.S.

01:07:10.366 --> 01:07:11.847
[SPEAKER_10]: in cartridge form in 1988.

01:07:12.347 --> 01:07:16.528
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit of a different...

01:07:18.018 --> 01:07:18.418
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

01:07:40.405 --> 01:07:46.891
[SPEAKER_10]: You do have to buy items, which you'll need to get to different areas.

01:07:46.931 --> 01:07:47.792
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to get hearts.

01:07:49.694 --> 01:07:51.635
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can also buy new whips as you keep going on.

01:07:53.237 --> 01:07:55.078
[SPEAKER_10]: You have an experience rating system.

01:07:56.019 --> 01:07:59.883
[SPEAKER_10]: So your experience rating increases, of course, as you collect hearts.

01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:06.649
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's actually something that made it into Dracula X. Not Dracula X, but Symphony of the Night, if you'll remember.

01:08:07.185 --> 01:08:35.695
[SPEAKER_04]: and as you can probably hear there a little bit of I did get the music to come up so of course Castlevania 2 who did not love the music in this game now we have some of the music playing in the background that's right but anyway I'll listen to it for a little bit easily one of the 10 best songs ever in a video game easily yeah

01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:46.249
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... Anyway, the whole point of the game is that you have to go to different mansions to find different parts of Dracula's corpse and then the magic cross.

01:08:46.929 --> 01:08:55.352
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um... You can actually use the different body parts as power-ups, kind of, like the rib bone is a shield.

01:08:56.073 --> 01:08:56.913
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, um...

01:08:59.425 --> 01:09:02.970
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you get everything, you can clear the blockade to Dracula's Castle and fight!

01:09:04.211 --> 01:09:11.961
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it was directed by Akamatsu, who also did Castlevania III, and...

01:09:14.716 --> 01:09:21.138
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a password system for the US version as opposed to the save system that Famicom Disk System had.

01:09:21.178 --> 01:09:22.158
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like, side bike?

01:09:22.718 --> 01:09:24.038
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

01:09:25.059 --> 01:09:27.699
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also some pretty crazy English in the game.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.240
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, uh, naming Simon Simmon.

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:32.621
[SPEAKER_10]: Like with two M's.

01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:33.861
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um...

01:09:37.856 --> 01:09:48.001
[SPEAKER_10]: There's, you know, of course, the music in it was done by Matsubara Kenichi, who did the Castlevania Arcade, the Haunted Castle.

01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:52.943
[SPEAKER_10]: And they also used some of that for Simon's Quest.

01:09:56.045 --> 01:09:57.226
[SPEAKER_10]: It also has...

01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:05.132
[SPEAKER_10]: The different parts of the game, you know, the statues and things, crying blood.

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:08.073
[SPEAKER_10]: So, lots of cool stuff going on.

01:10:10.655 --> 01:10:14.156
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, it actually, the game caused some controversy in the U.S.

01:10:14.196 --> 01:10:14.996
[SPEAKER_10]: with Nintendo Power.

01:10:16.477 --> 01:10:25.181
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the second issue of Nintendo Power that had the Simon's Quest cover, and it was also with Howard and Nestor, if you remember Howard and Nestor.

01:10:26.642 --> 01:10:27.302
[SPEAKER_10]: But the...

01:10:29.406 --> 01:10:30.967
[SPEAKER_10]: The cover apparently scared children.

01:10:32.848 --> 01:10:34.169
[SPEAKER_10]: So, caused a little problem.

01:10:34.449 --> 01:10:36.811
[SPEAKER_04]: I got in trouble in grade school over this magazine.

01:10:37.071 --> 01:10:39.012
[SPEAKER_04]: It had nothing to do with the cover, actually.

01:10:39.052 --> 01:10:42.255
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that I brought it to school one day, and I was trying to show a friend of mine during class.

01:10:42.575 --> 01:10:43.696
[SPEAKER_04]: The teacher was pissed at me.

01:10:44.396 --> 01:10:47.358
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was so excited, because it was Castlevania II, and it was awesome.

01:10:47.998 --> 01:10:48.299
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.702
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, also, uh, with this...

01:10:53.868 --> 01:10:54.649
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:11:11.408 --> 01:11:18.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly this game was so different from the first Castlevania that you already kind of started splitting up the series in a way at this point.

01:11:18.614 --> 01:11:28.282
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just have to say real quick, it was very interesting in the 8-bit era how deviant sequels were of the original.

01:11:28.843 --> 01:11:30.644
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you think about Super Mario Bros.

01:11:31.004 --> 01:11:32.446
[SPEAKER_04]: 2, way different than the first one.

01:11:32.466 --> 01:11:33.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Bros.

01:11:33.026 --> 01:11:34.027
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 was a different game.

01:11:34.187 --> 01:11:40.429
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know, but still, our perception of it as kids, you know, not knowing this whole Japanese stuff, was way different here.

01:11:40.749 --> 01:11:42.689
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Castlevania 2 was really different.

01:11:43.009 --> 01:11:44.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man 2 was kind of different.

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:48.771
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of sequels in the 8-bit era were really different than the original game.

01:11:48.791 --> 01:11:50.552
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say that Mega Man 2 was at all different.

01:11:51.632 --> 01:12:00.074
[SPEAKER_10]: Each of the Mega Man games on the NES just kept adding different things and changing different, but they all pretty much kept the same formula.

01:12:00.154 --> 01:12:02.635
[SPEAKER_10]: Even the X series kept the same formula.

01:12:03.996 --> 01:12:13.821
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't really say that those weren't too different, but in this case, this one is a fairly big departure from how the first one went.

01:12:14.241 --> 01:12:21.785
[SPEAKER_04]: But then what was also particularly weird about this and Super Mario Bros., I guess you could say, is that they both went kind of back to the formula of the original in the third game.

01:12:22.485 --> 01:12:26.927
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Super Mario, debatable, but Castlevania definitely went back to kind of the formula of the first game.

01:12:26.947 --> 01:12:31.429
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, Super Mario 2 in Japan was what we got as the lost levels.

01:12:31.589 --> 01:12:32.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, sure.

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.730
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was...

01:12:33.214 --> 01:12:35.096
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like the first one, only harder.

01:12:35.576 --> 01:12:37.758
[SPEAKER_10]: And he had the poison mushrooms and stuff.

01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:38.879
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.586
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Mario, actually, if you look at it with the actual successors to the original, that one kept the same formula, too.

01:12:49.808 --> 01:12:51.970
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say real quick from chat, because this is a really good point.

01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:57.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, says, The platformer in Retro Game Challenge was different in all three versions.

01:12:58.255 --> 01:13:00.417
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in that game, they made the sequel so different.

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:01.518
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of like an inside joke.

01:13:03.516 --> 01:13:27.075
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at any rate, something that might be interesting to other people, this is from an interview in 2002, is Igarashi Koji, who is like one of my video game heroes and who I got a hug from, I'm so happy, actually was talking about considering a compilation of the NES titles for, I suppose, either Game Boy or PC, so...

01:13:28.081 --> 01:13:28.982
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this music right here.

01:13:29.002 --> 01:13:31.963
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the very first song you hear when you press start.

01:13:55.061 --> 01:14:00.426
[SPEAKER_04]: If nothing else, just like one of the best music game soundtracks you will ever hear.

01:14:00.767 --> 01:14:03.950
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I do have to say there is a Castlevania game that has a better soundtrack.

01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:14.159
[SPEAKER_10]: But in my opinion, it's Dracula X. Not just because it was Red Book Audio, because I actually like the process, the music on the SNES version better in some cases.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:17.843
[SPEAKER_10]: But it did have some fantastic mixes of the songs.

01:14:18.928 --> 01:14:23.810
[SPEAKER_10]: So, but I'd have to put this up there, at least as far as the NES titles go.

01:14:24.531 --> 01:14:25.951
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's probably got my favorite music in it.

01:14:26.792 --> 01:14:27.152
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

01:14:27.232 --> 01:14:33.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Our other pal, Bress Lowell, in chat, who, of course, is a co-host on Understation Live, says, Simon's Quest is actually my least favorite Castlevania game.

01:14:34.115 --> 01:14:38.137
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if you want to see something really funny about Simon's Quest, just look for the Angry Nintendo Nerd.

01:14:39.137 --> 01:14:39.317
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:14:40.037 --> 01:14:43.199
[SPEAKER_10]: His version, his description of it was fantastic.

01:14:44.482 --> 01:14:51.606
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say my least favorite Castlevania game, and I know this is one of your favorites, Jamie, but Castlevania V on the SNES was ruined for me.

01:14:52.147 --> 01:14:52.227
[SPEAKER_04]: V?

01:14:52.427 --> 01:14:53.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, right?

01:14:53.588 --> 01:14:59.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was supposed to be the port of Dracula... It came out as Dracula X. Didn't they call it Dracula V?

01:14:59.812 --> 01:15:07.977
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they called it Dracula X. I thought in a magazine it was like Castlevania V. I've got the box, it says Dracula X. But I just thought at some point, I remember referring to it as Castlevania V, but...

01:15:08.932 --> 01:15:11.673
[SPEAKER_10]: It did come out after Super Castlevania 4.

01:15:11.853 --> 01:15:12.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

01:15:12.533 --> 01:15:19.936
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was so... Yeah, no, it was really... I would have to say neutered.

01:15:20.536 --> 01:15:26.518
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a castrated version of Dracula X. Rob, you're going to have to come over some night and just play through Dracula X with me.

01:15:26.858 --> 01:15:27.718
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun.

01:15:27.858 --> 01:15:29.018
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Neo Geo.

01:15:29.038 --> 01:15:29.899
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to put a feed up.

01:15:32.233 --> 01:15:33.514
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob playing as Maria.

01:15:34.034 --> 01:15:36.016
[SPEAKER_10]: La la la, la la la la.

01:15:36.076 --> 01:15:37.116
[SPEAKER_10]: One of her attacks is singing.

01:15:37.617 --> 01:15:37.817
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

01:15:38.057 --> 01:15:40.418
[SPEAKER_10]: And she sings badly that it kills like everything around her.

01:15:40.558 --> 01:15:42.179
[SPEAKER_10]: And her little thing is la la la, la la la.

01:15:44.721 --> 01:15:48.423
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you're forgetting, I think Breslau might be neglecting a Castlevania Judgment.

01:15:49.564 --> 01:15:49.964
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh, what?

01:15:50.424 --> 01:15:51.485
[SPEAKER_04]: The fighting game on Wii.

01:15:51.605 --> 01:15:51.825
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:15:52.265 --> 01:15:52.946
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't, what?

01:15:53.146 --> 01:15:53.486
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

01:15:53.506 --> 01:15:54.787
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't exist in your universe.

01:15:54.927 --> 01:15:55.167
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:58.127
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe Castlevania 64?

01:15:58.967 --> 01:15:59.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap!

01:15:59.808 --> 01:16:02.089
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, Breslul, Castlevania 64.

01:16:02.129 --> 01:16:02.970
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Loki wins.

01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:04.571
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty bad.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:07.633
[SPEAKER_04]: That was definitely a low point in the Castlevania series.

01:16:08.093 --> 01:16:11.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:11.055 --> 01:16:12.096
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break, though.

01:16:12.136 --> 01:16:15.678
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so please stay tuned.

01:16:15.718 --> 01:16:16.759
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be right back.

01:16:22.915 --> 01:16:23.636
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:16:44.534 --> 01:16:49.916
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had some rants and stuff, and I got angry earlier in the show, but obviously I saved this for later in the show.

01:16:50.016 --> 01:16:51.517
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out I might be wrong.

01:16:51.897 --> 01:16:52.837
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have been wrong.

01:16:54.098 --> 01:16:57.199
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like to admit when I'm wrong, but apparently I was wrong.

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.961
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to do with Avatar, that movie that came out.

01:17:00.981 --> 01:17:04.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember I was coming out here saying, oh, this movie's probably going to bomb.

01:17:04.642 --> 01:17:06.363
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's going to fucking care about Avatar.

01:17:07.483 --> 01:17:09.424
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a 70-something million at the box office.

01:17:10.837 --> 01:17:11.678
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:17:28.541 --> 01:17:29.541
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:17:59.372 --> 01:18:00.533
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:18:22.888 --> 01:18:23.508
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

01:18:45.134 --> 01:18:45.655
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

01:19:06.118 --> 01:19:08.060
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:25.339
[SPEAKER_13]: Walk over to get my salt, what is there?

01:19:25.999 --> 01:19:26.659
[SPEAKER_13]: A butter pump.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.642
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you can put as much fucking butter on this popcorn as you want.

01:19:31.002 --> 01:19:39.008
[SPEAKER_13]: And, not only that, they have the season, you know, the different season popcorn toppings that normally at the UA would charge you to get a little, like, container of it.

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:39.568
[SPEAKER_13]: All free.

01:19:41.049 --> 01:19:42.090
[SPEAKER_13]: Unlimited butter on this thing.

01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:44.191
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, oh my god, this is the greatest theater ever.

01:19:44.411 --> 01:19:46.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, all you can eat butter?

01:19:47.494 --> 01:19:47.954
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

01:19:49.244 --> 01:19:50.965
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:20:14.372 --> 01:20:16.313
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the directions?

01:20:16.653 --> 01:20:18.514
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know how they have directions on how to wash your hands?

01:20:18.534 --> 01:20:19.414
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there was no directions.

01:20:19.494 --> 01:20:20.415
[SPEAKER_13]: It just said topping.

01:20:20.535 --> 01:20:22.035
[SPEAKER_13]: It did not say butter topping.

01:20:22.216 --> 01:20:23.176
[SPEAKER_13]: It just said topping.

01:20:23.456 --> 01:20:25.857
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, well, this could be, like, anything.

01:20:26.758 --> 01:20:29.699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's some people in chat saying, this isn't news, Loki.

01:20:29.759 --> 01:20:30.639
[SPEAKER_04]: My theater does that.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.581
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, none of ours do, so it's news for me.

01:20:34.901 --> 01:20:36.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the ultimate question.

01:20:36.642 --> 01:20:38.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there bacon seasoning?

01:20:38.883 --> 01:20:40.724
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that I'm aware of, but, you know...

01:20:42.245 --> 01:20:43.145
[SPEAKER_13]: Steps, baby steps.

01:20:43.185 --> 01:20:43.766
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, I see.

01:20:43.826 --> 01:20:45.046
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a step in the right direction.

01:20:45.647 --> 01:20:47.147
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not bite off more than we can chew.

01:20:47.427 --> 01:20:48.908
[SPEAKER_13]: And bacon salt's not that good.

01:20:49.008 --> 01:20:49.508
[SPEAKER_13]: Trust me.

01:20:50.329 --> 01:20:54.791
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, as cool of a concept as bacon salt is, it does not taste like bacon.

01:20:56.127 --> 01:20:56.787
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

01:20:57.687 --> 01:21:01.589
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more topics tonight, some other news stories.

01:21:02.069 --> 01:21:03.469
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had to say that about Avatar.

01:21:03.489 --> 01:21:08.571
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can man up and admit when I was wrong, and I may have been wrong about Avatar.

01:21:08.591 --> 01:21:12.772
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say I was wrong about Avatar because I haven't seen it yet, but I may have been wrong about it.

01:21:13.732 --> 01:21:14.072
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

01:21:14.152 --> 01:21:14.792
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty good.

01:21:14.812 --> 01:21:16.513
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd go see it in the theater and in 3D.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:46.338
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to see it in 3D I will see it in 3D I promise but I also have to see Princess and the Frog because I did get to meet Princess Tiana this weekend and she's mighty fierce and I heard some of the songs from Princess and the Frog in the little street show they do I really want to see Princess and the Frog so that's at the top of my list then maybe Avatar if my mom doesn't drag me to see Precious on Christmas which is likely how about some gaming news less movies more games yes

01:21:48.042 --> 01:21:51.323
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess we got some rapid fire news to go into here.

01:21:51.803 --> 01:21:52.043
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

01:21:53.103 --> 01:21:59.284
[SPEAKER_13]: Starting things off, Dead or Alive is coming to the PSP, but not what you might think.

01:21:59.364 --> 01:22:05.846
[SPEAKER_13]: Dead or Alive Paradise, which is Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, minus the volleyball.

01:22:05.966 --> 01:22:12.087
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just Dead or Alive giggling girls in bikinis jumping around, watching their boobs move.

01:22:12.887 --> 01:22:14.868
[SPEAKER_13]: to music the game.

01:22:16.208 --> 01:22:18.129
[SPEAKER_13]: So, that's awesome.

01:22:19.609 --> 01:22:20.330
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Tecmo.

01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:23.431
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they just call it Boob Physics the game?

01:22:24.691 --> 01:22:25.691
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that would be offensive.

01:22:26.171 --> 01:22:26.672
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:22:27.732 --> 01:22:31.553
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, so it'll be coming out Spring 2010 and it's awesome.

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:33.794
[SPEAKER_13]: That's innovation right there.

01:22:33.974 --> 01:22:34.314
[SPEAKER_13]: PSP 4000?

01:22:34.374 --> 01:22:34.554
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

01:22:34.574 --> 01:22:34.714
[SPEAKER_13]: That.

01:22:37.281 --> 01:22:57.290
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of fake boobs, Playboy has done their annual Girls of Video Games, their 2010 spread, and this year they'll be featuring women from such games as God of War, Crimecraft, The Saboteur, Dante's Inferno, Mafia 2, and Heavy Rain, including some characters I don't know because I haven't played those games yet.

01:22:58.651 --> 01:22:59.471
[SPEAKER_13]: Skylar, St.

01:22:59.531 --> 01:23:00.832
[SPEAKER_13]: Clair from The Saboteur...

01:23:03.396 --> 01:23:08.501
[SPEAKER_13]: Madison Page, I guess the main character from Heavy Rain, is new in there as well.

01:23:08.541 --> 01:23:17.611
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want to see some fake naked boobies, I guess, then pick up the January-February issue of Playboy.

01:23:17.631 --> 01:23:19.373
[SPEAKER_13]: So now they're skipping months in Playboy?

01:23:19.513 --> 01:23:20.774
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, has it come down to that?

01:23:20.794 --> 01:23:21.735
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it bi-monthly now?

01:23:22.235 --> 01:23:22.556
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:23:25.267 --> 01:23:35.154
[SPEAKER_04]: I still don't understand the idea of buying Playboy for video game rendered characters, but I suppose either way you buy the magazine, the girls are fake.

01:23:35.314 --> 01:23:40.497
[SPEAKER_13]: They have Tara Reid on the cover, but I bet you she's not topless, even though she's a slut.

01:23:42.058 --> 01:23:45.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it be bad if I said, yeah, she is topless because I saw the pictures?

01:23:46.841 --> 01:23:47.662
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, awesome.

01:23:47.742 --> 01:23:50.824
[SPEAKER_13]: But still, that's not like... I don't know.

01:23:51.672 --> 01:23:53.873
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about as real as the video game magazine spread.

01:23:53.913 --> 01:23:54.494
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

01:23:54.654 --> 01:23:55.154
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

01:23:55.934 --> 01:24:00.357
[SPEAKER_13]: And finally, this Thursday, we're going to be getting some wonderful holiday treats as well.

01:24:00.877 --> 01:24:12.703
[SPEAKER_13]: On the 22nd, not only will we be getting the download content for LittleBigPlanet, which is going to be all sorts of awesome, but we'll be getting the Gran Turismo 5 Time Trial Challenge.

01:24:12.803 --> 01:24:17.345
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, if you have a Japanese account, you can download that right now, and it's in English.

01:24:18.146 --> 01:24:18.286
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

01:24:18.946 --> 01:24:47.499
[SPEAKER_13]: Puzzle Get In which I think came out last week on the Puzzle to Destroy All Puzzles Puzzle Get In Puzzle Get In Let's see, also there will be of course Guitar Hero 5 songs High Speed Soul by Not A Surf, Sister Jack by Spoon, Cut Your Hair by Pavement and the Indie Rock Track Pack featuring all three of those as well um

01:24:49.036 --> 01:24:53.780
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, of course, the download content, which is really the most important thing.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.364
[SPEAKER_13]: The PlayStation 1 Classic, though, this week is going to be Final Fantasy VIII, and that's pretty awesome.

01:24:58.724 --> 01:24:59.105
[SPEAKER_13]: Woohoo!

01:24:59.725 --> 01:25:02.507
[SPEAKER_13]: So, that'll be coming out on... Wait, Final Fantasy VIII?

01:25:02.768 --> 01:25:02.948
[SPEAKER_04]: VIII.

01:25:03.068 --> 01:25:03.388
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:06.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's not Final Fantasy IX.

01:25:06.411 --> 01:25:07.672
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they just skipped ahead to IX.

01:25:08.263 --> 01:25:09.904
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, Final Fantasy IX wasn't that good.

01:25:09.924 --> 01:25:11.466
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we ignored that VIII happened.

01:25:11.546 --> 01:25:12.466
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, I liked VIII.

01:25:12.486 --> 01:25:13.828
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked VIII.

01:25:14.348 --> 01:25:15.349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just being dramatic.

01:25:15.369 --> 01:25:18.571
[SPEAKER_10]: Except the last disc bored the crap out of me.

01:25:18.892 --> 01:25:19.912
[SPEAKER_04]: VIII had a good story.

01:25:20.153 --> 01:25:21.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all know how I feel about the battle system.

01:25:21.894 --> 01:25:24.416
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't, I've ranted about it like 50 times in the history of this show.

01:25:24.456 --> 01:25:26.178
[SPEAKER_10]: I got so tired of seeing Mob Bros.

01:25:26.978 --> 01:25:30.941
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, I was like, they could not have come up with a better name for this stupid, ugly creature.

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:32.383
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, of course, some PSP minis.

01:25:32.443 --> 01:25:37.747
[SPEAKER_13]: Hercules, Chariot Racing, and Spot the Differences is the other game.

01:25:38.823 --> 01:25:40.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

01:25:40.884 --> 01:25:42.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Spot the Differences?

01:25:43.766 --> 01:25:44.646
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the name of the game.

01:25:44.786 --> 01:25:45.747
[SPEAKER_13]: Spot the Differences.

01:25:46.927 --> 01:25:48.528
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I even need to crack a joke here?

01:25:48.668 --> 01:25:50.329
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the jokes write themselves.

01:25:50.349 --> 01:25:51.730
[SPEAKER_13]: They have the PSP 2000 and the PSP Go.

01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:53.151
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, what, one's crap?

01:25:53.431 --> 01:25:53.651
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

01:25:54.751 --> 01:25:55.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Spot the Differences.

01:25:59.141 --> 01:26:08.387
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be awesome if we could make a game like that and just like completely obvious differences like, you know, one's a puppy, one's a Hindenburg disaster, you know, this ridiculous stuff.

01:26:09.407 --> 01:26:12.249
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be sweet.

01:26:12.269 --> 01:26:13.470
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy's less violent, right?

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.790
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

01:26:18.493 --> 01:26:21.875
[SPEAKER_04]: One's a picture of Brittany Murphy, one's a picture of Heath... Never mind, I better not go there.

01:26:21.995 --> 01:26:22.295
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:24.170
[SPEAKER_13]: She's a chick.

01:26:25.891 --> 01:26:27.331
[SPEAKER_13]: She didn't die from a drug overdose.

01:26:27.411 --> 01:26:28.271
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, no.

01:26:28.391 --> 01:26:29.292
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not probably it.

01:26:29.672 --> 01:26:30.192
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on.

01:26:31.552 --> 01:26:32.252
[SPEAKER_13]: She was the Joker.

01:26:34.293 --> 01:26:34.453
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

01:26:36.793 --> 01:26:38.094
[SPEAKER_10]: I found something else I was looking for.

01:26:38.974 --> 01:26:41.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought you found the differences we were talking about.

01:26:41.615 --> 01:26:46.456
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I found something for you, Rob, that I wanted you to play during break and you didn't, so you have to play it after the show.

01:26:46.994 --> 01:26:47.754
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

01:26:59.910 --> 01:27:02.531
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks for her family I don't care The end

01:27:28.444 --> 01:27:29.785
[SPEAKER_13]: Does Tara Reid sing any music?

01:27:30.386 --> 01:27:31.087
[SPEAKER_13]: You can put her in there.

01:27:31.467 --> 01:27:31.867
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:27:32.888 --> 01:27:33.229
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:27:35.911 --> 01:27:36.232
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

01:27:39.855 --> 01:27:42.478
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like just suddenly the Hindenburg disaster.

01:27:42.678 --> 01:27:43.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on, hold on.

01:27:43.519 --> 01:27:44.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you spot the difference?

01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:49.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's program, Hindenburg disaster.

01:27:50.706 --> 01:27:52.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you spot the difference?

01:27:55.379 --> 01:27:57.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathwishing might have found it in chat.

01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:01.103
[SPEAKER_04]: It said, pro tip, Hindenburg powered by puppies with cute kitten pilots.

01:28:04.085 --> 01:28:05.005
[SPEAKER_13]: I want a picture of that.

01:28:05.966 --> 01:28:06.666
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

01:28:07.627 --> 01:28:08.187
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

01:28:09.548 --> 01:28:13.151
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get in some more last minute, or not last minute.

01:28:13.591 --> 01:28:14.872
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I want the show to be over.

01:28:16.793 --> 01:28:41.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob Rapid Fire Topics Hey, there's a game called Zero Day Attack in Earth Coming to Xbox Live Marketplace on December 23rd That's right, Martians invade the Earth, shoot them up, bang bang, blow up Not the type of game that Square Enix is usually known for But, here's the kicker about the game It uses satellite photography So if you want to blow up real things Have a blast Just don't

01:28:42.281 --> 01:28:43.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:29:02.011 --> 01:29:06.816
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be... I can just see horrific YouTubes coming of this game.

01:29:06.836 --> 01:29:07.556
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

01:29:07.596 --> 01:29:10.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Horrific YouTubes even worse than the joke I told earlier.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:11.300
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow...

01:29:12.972 --> 01:29:18.496
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you were offended by my earlier joke, I have to say to you, well, excuse me, Internet.

01:29:18.996 --> 01:29:26.561
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, that old catchphrase, excuse me, princess coin from the Legend of Zelda cartoons, which used to run as like the Friday special on the Super Mario Bros.

01:29:26.581 --> 01:29:27.102
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Show.

01:29:27.822 --> 01:29:34.627
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're kind of younger, you probably don't remember this unless you kind of seen it in a nostalgia post or whatever.

01:29:34.667 --> 01:29:36.448
[SPEAKER_04]: But I certainly remember this from when I was younger.

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:39.090
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet a lot of our listeners remember this because I think I was around like 10.

01:29:39.670 --> 01:29:41.371
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of our listeners, you know, 5, 6, probably or 10.

01:29:41.411 --> 01:29:41.812
[SPEAKER_04]: On Fridays?

01:29:43.348 --> 01:29:48.371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they would have the Zelda cartoon on Fridays, because the rest of the week was Mario cartoons, but Friday was Zelda cartoons.

01:29:48.431 --> 01:29:54.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, those came out on DVD a while back, and if you bought those, well, it sucks to be you, because they're all free on Hulu now.

01:29:54.755 --> 01:30:05.221
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to see these cartoons and what they're all about, if you just want to see the lols that is this, although I will say this, this was definitely a step above the Phillips CDI cutscenes.

01:30:05.721 --> 01:30:07.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were just...

01:30:08.103 --> 01:30:08.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

01:30:08.823 --> 01:30:10.304
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like I drew in paint.

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:11.145
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

01:30:11.885 --> 01:30:12.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were wow.

01:30:12.546 --> 01:30:17.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are not available on Hulu, but the Zelda stuff is now on Hulu.

01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:22.092
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to relive your youth or have another youth, I don't know.

01:30:22.472 --> 01:30:24.513
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, also in

01:30:25.774 --> 01:30:26.894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:45.740
[SPEAKER_04]: G.O.G.

01:31:11.218 --> 01:31:12.159
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be something completely different.

01:31:12.179 --> 01:31:13.580
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that you said it, I thought you said photography.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:14.680
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't speak tonight.

01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:15.361
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is.

01:31:15.601 --> 01:31:17.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob can speak good.

01:31:18.723 --> 01:31:19.764
[SPEAKER_04]: I might need to see a doctor.

01:31:20.284 --> 01:31:23.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, DarkSakura, do you have some rapid-fire news for us?

01:31:24.306 --> 01:31:26.148
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I do, Rob.

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:28.489
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't make me twist your arm or nothing.

01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:31.491
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't bring us cupcakes, by the way.

01:31:32.992 --> 01:31:34.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, boo-hoo, I'm sorry.

01:31:35.621 --> 01:31:38.983
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, how about some more stuff for the iPhone?

01:31:39.524 --> 01:31:54.574
[SPEAKER_10]: There is Need for Speed Shift coming out for iPhone for $9.99, 20 cars, 18 tracks, tilt functionality, which means lack of functionality, and you can play over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

01:31:55.054 --> 01:31:55.714
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.

01:31:56.895 --> 01:31:57.916
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I'm kind of...

01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:00.271
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

01:32:21.599 --> 01:32:27.562
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally actually really dug the last Ridge Racer that came out on iPhone, even though I didn't play it too long because I did get a little pissed off.

01:32:28.162 --> 01:32:30.443
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, give it a go, let us know what you think.

01:32:31.003 --> 01:32:31.984
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, um...

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:40.725
[SPEAKER_10]: One other thing, and this has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with Rock Band because it's about Rock Band.

01:32:41.525 --> 01:32:47.349
[SPEAKER_10]: The holiday lineup for Rock Band Weekly is going to be Weezer.

01:32:49.691 --> 01:32:54.354
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have songs from Limp Bizkit, The Offspring, and Yellow Card.

01:32:55.214 --> 01:32:59.177
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't forget, Rock Band Unplugged download content is on hiatus.

01:33:01.192 --> 01:33:04.835
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's what we're looking at for the Weezer pack.

01:33:05.335 --> 01:33:10.579
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Beverly Hills, Let It All Hang Out, and if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:15.463
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Limp Bizkit, Build a Bridge, The Offspring, A Lot Like Me, and Yellow Card Ocean Avenue.

01:33:16.184 --> 01:33:19.266
[SPEAKER_10]: The latter three will be 160 points.

01:33:19.326 --> 01:33:24.070
[SPEAKER_10]: The pack for Weezer is 440 or 160 for each, again.

01:33:24.951 --> 01:33:27.293
[SPEAKER_10]: And they are also available for LEGO Rock Band.

01:33:29.875 --> 01:33:30.295
[SPEAKER_13]: The End!

01:33:30.876 --> 01:33:37.020
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say that Reduce is pretty awesome to be coming to the iPhone, but it's no Daytona.

01:33:43.044 --> 01:33:45.125
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving right along into other topics tonight.

01:33:45.405 --> 01:33:46.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how about some Twitter topics?

01:33:51.509 --> 01:33:55.212
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we request your ideas and suggestions for topics over Twitter.

01:33:57.342 --> 01:34:00.005
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw305 sent us this article about Gamers attempt to catch every Pokemon in 72 hours for charity.

01:34:12.919 --> 01:34:16.562
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, some very bored gamers have... No, it's for charity, you can't say that.

01:34:16.862 --> 01:34:23.248
[SPEAKER_04]: But some gamers have decided to catch every Pokemon in existence, 493 of them to be exact, in 72 hours!

01:34:23.988 --> 01:34:24.989
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all for charity.

01:34:25.029 --> 01:34:30.073
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually not for Child's Play, as a lot of these recent marathons have been for, which is obviously a great charity.

01:34:30.374 --> 01:34:32.075
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for a different one, it's called Allie's House.

01:34:32.155 --> 01:34:40.022
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an Oklahoma-based children's cancer foundation that provides support for families with medical expenses, short-term housing, and other types of needs.

01:34:40.523 --> 01:34:42.307
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a charity that involves killing sims.

01:34:51.088 --> 01:34:52.649
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be an idea for a marathon there.

01:34:53.249 --> 01:34:55.690
[SPEAKER_04]: Put up a proposal, Loki, and bring it to the show.

01:34:55.730 --> 01:34:56.310
[SPEAKER_04]: We might do this.

01:34:57.310 --> 01:35:02.872
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw also sent us a quick link to an article that Blizzard will definitely work on a console game at some point.

01:35:03.812 --> 01:35:08.834
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in other words, not StarCraft Ghost, but like for real this time, some type of console game.

01:35:09.234 --> 01:35:11.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, really, I think the title of this says it all.

01:35:11.215 --> 01:35:12.975
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they've done so many great PC games.

01:35:13.455 --> 01:35:15.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's about time for them to do a console game.

01:35:17.142 --> 01:35:20.545
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just wanted to clarify, I don't see the PC market as being bad.

01:35:20.625 --> 01:35:22.707
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have 12 million players 10 years ago.

01:35:23.087 --> 01:35:26.751
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever the format, console or PC, I think if there's a good game, it's going to be played.

01:35:27.171 --> 01:35:29.153
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on PC because it's familiar to us.

01:35:29.793 --> 01:35:32.996
[SPEAKER_04]: Console, we have to worry about those unfamiliar things.

01:35:35.679 --> 01:35:39.542
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming to us from Twitter, from Deathwishing, three questions from Deathwishing.

01:35:39.883 --> 01:35:42.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I buy LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year?

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:45.953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, if you like platformers like Mario Brothers, yes, yes, yes.

01:35:45.993 --> 01:35:46.794
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great game.

01:35:46.854 --> 01:35:48.555
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my game of the year, the year it came out.

01:35:48.956 --> 01:35:54.921
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus, you get the beta for Mod Nation Racers, so you gotta act quick, because that just started on the 18th.

01:35:55.922 --> 01:35:58.825
[SPEAKER_04]: Socom Confrontation, I guess.

01:35:59.025 --> 01:35:59.545
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a game?

01:35:59.785 --> 01:36:00.406
[SPEAKER_13]: Confrontation.

01:36:00.486 --> 01:36:01.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Confrontation.

01:36:01.307 --> 01:36:01.947
[SPEAKER_04]: He spelled it wrong then.

01:36:02.008 --> 01:36:02.868
[SPEAKER_04]: Confrontation.

01:36:03.749 --> 01:36:05.570
[SPEAKER_04]: And did you guys try out Dante's Inferno?

01:36:06.091 --> 01:36:07.772
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not try out Dante's Inferno.

01:36:07.892 --> 01:36:08.933
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded the demo.

01:36:08.953 --> 01:36:10.674
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it yet because I was gone all weekend.

01:36:10.734 --> 01:36:12.315
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard it's pretty terrible.

01:36:12.635 --> 01:36:13.636
[SPEAKER_13]: I've already played God of War.

01:36:13.656 --> 01:36:13.976
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

01:36:15.217 --> 01:36:16.017
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you checked out the demo?

01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:16.998
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I haven't.

01:36:17.658 --> 01:36:18.699
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard it's pretty bad.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:20.781
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

01:36:20.821 --> 01:36:23.763
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I don't like to base games purely off the demo.

01:36:23.883 --> 01:36:28.186
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got a level of... Well, it's going to be good.

01:36:28.766 --> 01:36:29.466
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll probably play it.

01:36:29.546 --> 01:36:30.107
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know...

01:36:30.936 --> 01:36:32.117
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Conan the Librarian

01:36:55.933 --> 01:36:56.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

01:36:56.333 --> 01:36:56.673
[SPEAKER_04]: Good deal.

01:36:57.474 --> 01:36:59.175
[SPEAKER_04]: GamerGirl sends us a tweet.

01:36:59.215 --> 01:37:00.896
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your take on Final Fantasy XIII?

01:37:00.996 --> 01:37:01.996
[SPEAKER_04]: Good or not so good?

01:37:02.656 --> 01:37:03.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't tell you.

01:37:03.197 --> 01:37:04.157
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't import the game.

01:37:04.177 --> 01:37:07.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't want to pay those types of fees when the game's coming out here in a few months.

01:37:07.339 --> 01:37:09.140
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like $100 since it's in Japanese only.

01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.661
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't justify doing that.

01:37:11.821 --> 01:37:19.625
[SPEAKER_13]: But the demo we played a few months ago and... The demo was fun, but once again, you know, I played the demo a few times and I'm like, why did I buy this?

01:37:20.486 --> 01:37:20.726
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.

01:37:21.377 --> 01:37:21.817
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

01:37:22.018 --> 01:37:23.579
[SPEAKER_04]: But that wasn't anything about the game.

01:37:23.619 --> 01:37:26.602
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just why did you spend so much money on a demo?

01:37:26.662 --> 01:37:31.187
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, okay, I don't know what's really going on here.

01:37:31.267 --> 01:37:31.607
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

01:37:31.627 --> 01:37:32.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at some other tweets.

01:37:32.528 --> 01:37:36.532
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple things of stuff that we did earlier in the show and that is basically it.

01:37:36.592 --> 01:37:38.053
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys for your tweets.

01:37:38.233 --> 01:37:39.595
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we'll take some more next week.

01:37:39.655 --> 01:37:43.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:45.621
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, back to some more news.

01:37:46.516 --> 01:37:49.938
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Nintendo has some interesting things going on.

01:37:50.178 --> 01:37:56.742
[SPEAKER_13]: They've announced their new titles coming out in the first part of the year.

01:37:56.762 --> 01:38:00.985
[SPEAKER_13]: 2010, of course, they're going to launch their first Wii game.

01:38:01.005 --> 01:38:06.128
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be Endless Ocean 2, the sequel to the Deep Sea Diving Sim.

01:38:06.608 --> 01:38:08.169
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really play a lot of the first one.

01:38:08.209 --> 01:38:13.612
[SPEAKER_13]: It was kind of neat, very pretty, but not something I really want to jump into for the next one.

01:38:14.472 --> 01:38:40.085
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, some DS titles, of course, the newest, I guess, I wouldn't really call them brand new, but, uh, Pokemon Heart, Gold, and SoulSilver, the kind of remix of, uh, Gold and Silver, and, um, there's some other cool things, uh, WiiWare titles, including And Yet It Moves, of course, um, like, you know, Super Meat Boy is kind of cool, they also have some third-party stuff listed as well, um,

01:38:42.153 --> 01:38:43.734
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing to stand out from Konami.

01:38:43.774 --> 01:38:53.380
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, for example, we've got Dance Dance Revolution, although I believe that's... No, maybe that is a new title, Dance Dance Revolution.

01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:57.883
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard there is some controversy going on right now because I think that list came out.

01:38:58.504 --> 01:39:05.889
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now that brand new Dance Dance Revolution is only slated for PS3 and Xbox and wasn't announced for Wii.

01:39:06.409 --> 01:39:09.251
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like, was this the announcement or what?

01:39:09.411 --> 01:39:22.598
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, the other thing, too, with Dance... I could see it probably coming to the Wii, but, you know, I remember before they were kind of lumping in all those games, you know, before at E3, as Dance Dance Revolution 1, Dance Dance Revolution for the Wii ended up being hot as Party 3, so... Right.

01:39:22.999 --> 01:39:29.883
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then same for the PlayStation 2, it ended up being X2, so... Eh, it might not be entirely accurate, but that's alright.

01:39:30.383 --> 01:39:30.503
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

01:39:31.713 --> 01:39:41.641
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, as a long time music game fan and someone who's been critical of DDR over the past few years, I am interested in the reboot game that they're doing on Xbox 360 and PS3 because it is a reboot.

01:39:42.001 --> 01:39:44.623
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I've been saying DDR has needed for about five years.

01:39:45.784 --> 01:39:46.205
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

01:39:46.445 --> 01:39:50.608
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR hasn't just needed a reboot, it's needed a resuscitation and a kick in the ass.

01:39:51.289 --> 01:39:54.651
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will see if this is it, although I will say the expectations are very low.

01:39:54.992 --> 01:39:57.013
[SPEAKER_04]: So Konami doesn't have to do much to impress me.

01:39:57.453 --> 01:39:57.834
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

01:39:59.059 --> 01:39:59.940
[SPEAKER_13]: WarioWare DIY WarioWare DIY

01:40:18.596 --> 01:40:19.376
[SPEAKER_13]: on different YouTubes.

01:40:19.897 --> 01:40:22.978
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's going to be available as well in March.

01:40:23.699 --> 01:40:37.887
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally, just in time for Valentine's Day, you're going to be getting pink and blue Wii remotes are going to be released as well I believe just before Valentine's Day.

01:40:39.667 --> 01:40:41.589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, just as I always wanted a pink Wiimote.

01:40:42.609 --> 01:40:44.130
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well then remind me to get you one, Rob.

01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:45.371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, that's what I want for Christmas.

01:40:45.751 --> 01:40:47.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn, they're not out until February.

01:40:47.672 --> 01:40:47.872
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

01:40:48.632 --> 01:40:49.492
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe for my birthday.

01:40:49.832 --> 01:40:52.954
[SPEAKER_13]: Now if they put out a pink console, that might sell a little bit.

01:40:53.134 --> 01:40:58.396
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

01:40:58.616 --> 01:41:01.497
[SPEAKER_07]: The blue one's actually kind of cute.

01:41:01.597 --> 01:41:04.438
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember at E3 when they first showed the Wii?

01:41:05.279 --> 01:41:06.399
[SPEAKER_07]: How there were the blue ones?

01:41:06.599 --> 01:41:08.000
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, there were all the different colors.

01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:12.822
[SPEAKER_04]: But they didn't need to do that because the system sold like fucking nuts anyway.

01:41:13.202 --> 01:41:16.083
[SPEAKER_10]: And the curse of the white system did not hurt it.

01:41:18.345 --> 01:41:27.775
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, because the, well, no, the Saturn, well, I don't know what it is, alright, the Saturn in Japan came out in white.

01:41:28.496 --> 01:41:29.577
[SPEAKER_10]: We got it over here in black.

01:41:29.858 --> 01:41:30.338
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened?

01:41:30.879 --> 01:41:31.179
Poop.

01:41:31.599 --> 01:41:31.820
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead.

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:32.801
[SPEAKER_10]: So, see, they learned.

01:41:32.821 --> 01:41:33.261
[SPEAKER_10]: They learned.

01:41:33.542 --> 01:41:33.882
[SPEAKER_10]: They learned.

01:41:34.827 --> 01:41:36.088
[SPEAKER_04]: Ziii has been trademarked.

01:41:36.108 --> 01:41:36.788
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, rumors run rampant.

01:41:36.808 --> 01:41:37.428
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG, the Wii HD is the Ziii!

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:04.521
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way though, just so you know, Z actually was trademarked in 2006.

01:42:05.442 --> 01:42:15.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Also trademarked, the B, the C, the we, the ye, and the Z. This Sesame Street.

01:42:16.245 --> 01:42:18.065
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought the we was oi.

01:42:18.305 --> 01:42:22.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Oi, oi, oi, like a punk rock system.

01:42:22.786 --> 01:42:25.727
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's like a... It's for the hardcore gamer, the oi, oi.

01:42:26.087 --> 01:42:26.828
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's French.

01:42:27.628 --> 01:42:27.908
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

01:42:28.351 --> 01:42:33.213
[SPEAKER_10]: But, but, you know, also though, keep in mind, it's like, uh, you know, that totally made me think of Clue.

01:42:34.173 --> 01:42:34.373
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:42:34.553 --> 01:42:35.314
[SPEAKER_10]: Oui, oui, madame?

01:42:35.614 --> 01:42:36.274
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.

01:42:36.294 --> 01:42:37.194
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I know this?

01:42:37.875 --> 01:42:43.097
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they neglected the V because that's the one that the Chinese knockoff is called the V, isn't it?

01:42:43.297 --> 01:42:43.497
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

01:42:43.757 --> 01:42:44.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops, forgot that one.

01:42:45.157 --> 01:42:52.020
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and most importantly, uh, you forgot the P. Where's the P?

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:53.641
[SPEAKER_07]: In the toilet!

01:42:54.241 --> 01:42:54.361
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

01:42:56.152 --> 01:43:00.916
[SPEAKER_04]: and they missed... Now see what's funny, somebody in chat said they forgot She, XII.

01:43:00.996 --> 01:43:02.738
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that the name of a game on PlayStation?

01:43:03.298 --> 01:43:03.758
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say.

01:43:03.979 --> 01:43:05.900
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that was XIII.

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.943
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so XII was not taken, but XIII was.

01:43:10.924 --> 01:43:13.306
[SPEAKER_13]: She, though... It sounds familiar.

01:43:13.507 --> 01:43:13.867
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:43:15.011 --> 01:43:30.148
[SPEAKER_13]: The Z thing though, and unfortunately I don't have the ability to put that clip on our stream right now, but Z reminds me of Charlie the Unicorn, the second one, where they go and they meet Z and they start speaking Spanish to the Z. I remember that.

01:43:30.989 --> 01:43:33.491
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be totally appropriate for this, but...

01:43:35.361 --> 01:44:03.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathwishing in chat says the Nintendo oi with oi circle pit run and mosh your face off see it's for the hardcore gamer that's exactly what it is we're gonna do another story real quick here but I wanted to introduce someone who just walked into studio tonight say hello to Tiara why hello there how are you I'm good thank you thanks for joining us tonight how have you been you're tardy you know we start at 6 o'clock right yeah I know I went on a date wait hold on hold on aren't you just visiting

01:44:03.905 --> 01:44:07.029
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm visiting Jamie and I went out on a date with not Jamie.

01:44:08.731 --> 01:44:10.033
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a very naughty girl.

01:44:10.293 --> 01:44:10.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have fun?

01:44:11.034 --> 01:44:11.515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.

01:44:11.655 --> 01:44:17.322
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw The Blind Side, which I expected to hate, but apparently I like Sandra Bullock when she's not in a funny movie.

01:44:17.802 --> 01:44:18.103
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:44:18.403 --> 01:44:19.384
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she's not funny.

01:44:19.665 --> 01:44:20.045
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

01:44:21.158 --> 01:44:23.080
[SPEAKER_04]: I have played the hell out of Final Fantasy IV The After Years.

01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:23.961
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is so awesome!

01:44:45.001 --> 01:44:45.902
[SPEAKER_04]: I never finished it.

01:44:45.942 --> 01:44:48.964
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel bad because it was pretty badass, the parts that I played.

01:44:49.004 --> 01:44:52.006
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the opening chapter and I think I played a little bit of Rydia's side story.

01:44:52.506 --> 01:44:54.948
[SPEAKER_04]: But lots and lots of side stories to beat in that game.

01:44:54.988 --> 01:44:56.008
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have to be honest.

01:44:56.048 --> 01:44:57.009
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't buy all of them.

01:44:57.189 --> 01:45:01.592
[SPEAKER_01]: But I played through the opening chapter, which is like the first three.

01:45:01.672 --> 01:45:05.194
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I played through part of Rydia's chapter before I drove up here.

01:45:05.695 --> 01:45:11.959
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to go home and play that and have the Wii Fit tell me how fat I am because it loves to do that.

01:45:12.772 --> 01:45:17.057
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's always kind of a downer to get on Wii Fit, and then you watch as your character goes, whoop!

01:45:17.818 --> 01:45:18.859
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh!

01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:21.462
[SPEAKER_04]: But surely that hasn't happened for you.

01:45:21.522 --> 01:45:25.547
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually look like you've lost a little bit, so Wii Fit's been working for you.

01:45:25.767 --> 01:45:26.508
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's fun.

01:45:26.588 --> 01:45:28.710
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a master of the hula hoop now.

01:45:29.151 --> 01:45:30.232
[SPEAKER_01]: If only in real life.

01:45:30.252 --> 01:45:32.675
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good, useful skill, but no.

01:45:33.311 --> 01:45:33.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Eatsleepgeek.com Cool.

01:45:33.851 --> 01:45:34.312
[SPEAKER_04]: Who runs that?

01:45:34.332 --> 01:45:34.712
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of geeks?

01:45:54.983 --> 01:45:56.284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would have to say so.

01:45:56.444 --> 01:45:57.424
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a clever name.

01:45:57.785 --> 01:45:58.805
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

01:45:59.325 --> 01:46:00.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we ever going to start?

01:46:00.166 --> 01:46:05.709
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I've heard rumors that someday there might be a Giggling Girl comic book show of sorts.

01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:09.291
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Jamie and I had talked about that.

01:46:09.331 --> 01:46:14.914
[SPEAKER_01]: We had talked about doing kind of like a mini podcast for one of our weekly features for my blog.

01:46:15.574 --> 01:46:23.420
[SPEAKER_01]: But we never have time and of course I'm trying to graduate next year so I'm taking like eight classes in the semester.

01:46:23.701 --> 01:46:24.741
[SPEAKER_04]: She's already got a show.

01:46:24.821 --> 01:46:26.002
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit trying to ninja the hosts.

01:46:27.263 --> 01:46:28.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit trying to ninja them into your show.

01:46:29.585 --> 01:46:30.125
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

01:46:30.926 --> 01:46:32.207
[SPEAKER_07]: We're using that computer.

01:46:34.349 --> 01:46:36.931
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard they're going to borrow the show computer to do a side project.

01:46:36.951 --> 01:46:38.432
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's awesome.

01:46:38.572 --> 01:46:41.694
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys are able to find the time but certainly school is school.

01:46:42.095 --> 01:46:42.595
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed.

01:46:42.995 --> 01:46:43.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:52.401
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever need a guest who never reads comic books, I will totally come on and be like the gay guy on the show that says witty things.

01:46:53.237 --> 01:46:54.558
[SPEAKER_01]: I will totally book you for that.

01:46:54.578 --> 01:46:54.858
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

01:46:54.878 --> 01:46:58.461
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be like, comics, I don't know anything about that, but Wolverine is hot.

01:46:58.661 --> 01:47:01.343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I need you to call my manager, though.

01:47:01.443 --> 01:47:02.945
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get that all arranged.

01:47:03.705 --> 01:47:04.586
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you my card.

01:47:05.567 --> 01:47:06.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't call us.

01:47:06.067 --> 01:47:06.447
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll call you.

01:47:06.888 --> 01:47:07.208
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:47:08.609 --> 01:47:10.090
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but feel free, please, to pipe in.

01:47:10.110 --> 01:47:12.872
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we don't have a fourth mic in studio because we're a little ghetto.

01:47:13.212 --> 01:47:15.014
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to say something, raise your hand.

01:47:15.034 --> 01:47:16.075
[SPEAKER_04]: A little ghetto?

01:47:16.555 --> 01:47:17.916
[SPEAKER_04]: Just reach your hand out and grab my mic.

01:47:17.956 --> 01:47:18.536
[SPEAKER_04]: Or grab Loki.

01:47:18.576 --> 01:47:19.057
[SPEAKER_04]: He's closest.

01:47:19.777 --> 01:47:20.018
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:23.621
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, moving on with some more gaming news, DarkSakura.

01:47:23.881 --> 01:47:29.461
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, for the record, and completely off topic, you know how you're wondering if there was a game called Z?

01:47:30.262 --> 01:47:36.863
[SPEAKER_10]: There was an alternate reality game that came out on the PS3 for PlayStation Home.

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:38.063
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

01:47:38.083 --> 01:47:41.624
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Devil Dice was called Psy, which was spelled X-I.

01:47:42.664 --> 01:47:45.484
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had X-I, X-I-I, and X-I-I-I.

01:47:45.964 --> 01:47:46.684
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had stuff.

01:47:46.804 --> 01:47:49.885
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would like to create X-I-I-I-I, patent pending.

01:47:51.670 --> 01:47:52.631
[SPEAKER_04]: What, 13?

01:47:53.652 --> 01:47:54.834
[SPEAKER_04]: No, X-I-I-I-I, 14.

01:47:54.914 --> 01:47:57.156
[SPEAKER_10]: So should it be X-I-V?

01:47:58.178 --> 01:47:58.878
[SPEAKER_04]: You shut your mouth!

01:48:01.401 --> 01:48:02.342
[SPEAKER_10]: La la la, okay.

01:48:03.043 --> 01:48:04.905
[SPEAKER_10]: So how about my story, huh?

01:48:04.925 --> 01:48:05.606
[SPEAKER_04]: How about your story?

01:48:06.087 --> 01:48:06.868
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, how about that?

01:48:07.769 --> 01:48:11.373
[SPEAKER_10]: How about a particular rumor about a game I'm particularly looking forward to?

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:31.176
[SPEAKER_10]: For Super Street Fighter 4, the rumors that they're getting 10 new characters total is actually something based off of a clip from the Thummy2 stream that's showing a different list on here.

01:48:31.256 --> 01:48:35.820
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me see if I can't find who else might be included on here.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:48.587
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know for a fact that they're getting DJ and Feilong and Adon and Guy and Cody, right?

01:48:49.667 --> 01:48:54.930
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they've announced any new ones, but there's like placeholders here, right?

01:48:55.558 --> 01:49:01.742
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, see, there's four here that are completely blank, according to this.

01:49:01.842 --> 01:49:06.945
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can actually link the clip to the chat room if they want to look at it.

01:49:08.286 --> 01:49:10.868
[SPEAKER_10]: It definitely, I think, would be worth seeing.

01:49:13.209 --> 01:49:16.811
[SPEAKER_10]: But from what I can tell on here... No, Dan, you can't talk to me right now.

01:49:17.332 --> 01:49:17.572
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

01:49:18.833 --> 01:49:20.614
[SPEAKER_10]: What I can tell on here is that...

01:49:23.746 --> 01:49:33.237
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I recognized about everybody else on here, so I wouldn't think of who they could have put in unless they're adding in, like, Charlie and Rolento and maybe Hagar.

01:49:33.578 --> 01:49:41.187
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting is that the game, we were only supposed to be getting, like, six, I think, in an earlier interview, or maybe it was seven or eight, but now it's up to ten.

01:49:41.227 --> 01:49:42.909
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's almost like they can't put this down.

01:49:43.229 --> 01:49:43.710
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't...

01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:46.634
[SPEAKER_04]: Getaway from this project, which is a good thing.

01:49:46.714 --> 01:49:50.379
[SPEAKER_04]: It means that they really love it, but that's a lot of new characters, too.

01:49:50.439 --> 01:49:52.202
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just these four empty slots on here.

01:49:52.222 --> 01:49:55.346
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me wonder what's going to go in.

01:49:55.386 --> 01:49:59.993
[SPEAKER_10]: This has to be from some kind of beta or demo on here.

01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:04.637
[SPEAKER_13]: Hakan equals an Arab oil dude Ono talked about but hasn't been revealed yet

01:50:25.855 --> 01:50:31.256
[SPEAKER_04]: and I've heard that rumor too that there was some type of like oil tycoon fighter in it as well.

01:50:32.077 --> 01:50:34.997
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, GameGuru, is Charlie really dead or is he Jean Grey dead?

01:50:36.658 --> 01:50:37.038
[SPEAKER_10]: Answer that.

01:50:37.358 --> 01:50:40.759
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Street Fighter is like Heroes where people die but they don't ever like die.

01:50:41.379 --> 01:50:43.299
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's like Heroes where they get their brains eaten.

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe it's like Heroes where it starts to suck by the third season but then gets good again at the fourth season.

01:50:49.621 --> 01:50:52.702
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I stopped watching it at the fourth season but apparently...

01:50:54.014 --> 01:51:14.746
[SPEAKER_01]: of course you realize all I know about heroes is the brain eating and the cheerleader is like Wolverine look I'm just saying Street Fighter doesn't have Zachary Quinto that's all I'm saying ZQ or GTFO maybe it's like that episode of Heroes where Spock accidentally blows up Romulus and Nero goes back in time to find him

01:51:15.734 --> 01:51:16.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

01:51:16.815 --> 01:51:31.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, in an unrelated story that I don't think we covered yet, but did you hear about that, that ZQ actually announced this week at the Video Game Awards, he's going to be doing the voice for Star Trek Online, I guess like doing the opening narration or whatever, and I'm just like, he can talk to me anytime he wants.

01:51:32.143 --> 01:51:35.224
[SPEAKER_13]: But he will be doing a William Shatner impression.

01:51:35.324 --> 01:51:36.365
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

01:51:36.965 --> 01:51:40.587
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, by the way, I have decided to get the Amazon one, because I want a Borg chick.

01:51:41.567 --> 01:51:42.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fair enough.

01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:44.541
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:52:02.614 --> 01:52:08.318
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm going to totally out myself as a super nerd, but I read the Star Trek novels.

01:52:08.798 --> 01:52:09.339
[SPEAKER_01]: Nerd!

01:52:09.879 --> 01:52:16.864
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the novels, there's a half Vulcan who totally rejects her Vulcan side and is kind of sassy.

01:52:17.064 --> 01:52:19.426
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you could be sassy.

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:23.028
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't play MMOs and not be sassy.

01:52:23.148 --> 01:52:23.909
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my thing.

01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:25.530
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, we have to make the Olorians.

01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:27.972
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, and I'll have one of those.

01:52:27.992 --> 01:52:30.013
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be sassy in the pants.

01:52:30.073 --> 01:52:31.174
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to have a sassy Vulcan.

01:52:31.581 --> 01:52:32.762
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be sassy in the pants.

01:52:32.802 --> 01:52:33.202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

01:52:34.162 --> 01:52:34.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

01:52:34.863 --> 01:52:36.263
[SPEAKER_01]: I started playing WoW again, Rob.

01:52:36.303 --> 01:52:36.884
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see that?

01:52:36.924 --> 01:52:37.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucker.

01:52:37.904 --> 01:52:38.484
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?

01:52:38.825 --> 01:52:39.385
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going good.

01:52:39.445 --> 01:52:41.046
[SPEAKER_01]: My priest is almost 43.

01:52:41.926 --> 01:52:44.287
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using that dungeon finder thing.

01:52:46.548 --> 01:52:47.889
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jamie's on the phone with Dan.

01:52:48.329 --> 01:52:49.010
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be important.

01:52:50.290 --> 01:52:51.511
[SPEAKER_04]: The dungeon finder's great, though.

01:52:51.791 --> 01:52:53.272
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

01:52:53.332 --> 01:52:57.034
[SPEAKER_01]: I leveled from 37 to 42 in two days just doing that.

01:52:57.114 --> 01:52:57.494
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice.

01:52:58.479 --> 01:52:58.999
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't important.

01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:03.883
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, I am also getting Star Trek online, obviously, because I'm a big, huge nerd.

01:53:04.484 --> 01:53:06.445
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV, we talked about earlier in the show.

01:53:07.867 --> 01:53:08.047
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:53:11.229 --> 01:53:11.930
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:12.881
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

01:53:13.582 --> 01:53:15.643
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments in chat about the Sassy Vulcan.

01:53:15.943 --> 01:53:20.326
[SPEAKER_04]: SalaciousPop says, instead of saying that's not logical, she says, so ignorant.

01:53:21.646 --> 01:53:22.747
[SPEAKER_04]: So ignorant.

01:53:22.987 --> 01:53:27.790
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob's character, live long and prosper, betch.

01:53:30.351 --> 01:53:30.911
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.

01:53:30.951 --> 01:53:31.412
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

01:53:32.052 --> 01:53:32.932
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens there.

01:53:33.933 --> 01:53:37.094
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Tiger Claw is letting me know some specifics on that.

01:53:37.454 --> 01:53:40.395
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, he's also doing the voice of the emergency medical hologram.

01:53:40.856 --> 01:53:42.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I got to say, come on.

01:53:42.756 --> 01:53:44.737
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who did it, what was his name?

01:53:45.438 --> 01:53:50.140
[SPEAKER_04]: The emergency hologram program, Robert Picardo or whatever his name was in Voyager.

01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:54.481
[SPEAKER_04]: When you think emergency medical program, I always think of him.

01:53:54.782 --> 01:53:57.543
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how they got him a cameo in First Contact?

01:53:57.563 --> 01:53:58.003
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:53:58.601 --> 01:53:59.121
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan Lost My Copy

01:54:26.713 --> 01:54:28.774
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, sorry, let's get into some other gaming news.

01:54:28.794 --> 01:54:29.595
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple quick articles.

01:54:29.615 --> 01:54:30.955
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get to the mailbag here very soon.

01:54:31.095 --> 01:54:31.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

01:54:31.896 --> 01:54:40.420
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Nintendo has trademarked what is going to be about equally retarded as the Wii Vitality Sensor, Wii Relax.

01:54:42.601 --> 01:54:45.023
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's a game about relaxing.

01:54:46.663 --> 01:54:51.246
[SPEAKER_13]: It involves you putting on a vitality sensor so that you can relax.

01:54:51.446 --> 01:54:52.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Relax or die!

01:54:54.361 --> 01:54:55.442
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:55:18.737 --> 01:55:24.259
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that kind of counterintuitive, you know, with the whole Wii Fit?

01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.040
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I supposed to be moving?

01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:26.740
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know.

01:55:28.241 --> 01:55:28.721
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no.

01:55:30.542 --> 01:55:37.565
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the only thing I've ever known, like any type of exercise thing I've ever done where you have to keep perfectly still is doing isolation exercises.

01:55:37.865 --> 01:55:39.906
[SPEAKER_10]: So other than that, I don't know.

01:55:41.406 --> 01:55:42.447
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm grabbing at straws here.

01:55:42.607 --> 01:55:43.227
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to.

01:55:44.676 --> 01:55:45.597
[SPEAKER_10]: Find some logic in this.

01:55:45.937 --> 01:55:46.838
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:55:46.918 --> 01:55:50.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully the game is going to say, you know, relax, but don't touch yourself.

01:55:52.964 --> 01:55:53.564
[SPEAKER_07]: No wanking.

01:55:54.345 --> 01:55:55.206
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait a second.

01:55:55.346 --> 01:55:59.270
[SPEAKER_13]: The game is going to be like, please put it on your finger.

01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:00.451
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait a second.

01:56:00.471 --> 01:56:01.532
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not your finger.

01:56:02.953 --> 01:56:03.614
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop that.

01:56:03.754 --> 01:56:04.575
[SPEAKER_13]: That is dirty.

01:56:04.655 --> 01:56:05.856
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do not be fapping.

01:56:09.946 --> 01:56:11.126
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:56:38.578 --> 01:56:40.179
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't get more relaxed than a corpse.

01:56:41.399 --> 01:56:42.199
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just see it now.

01:56:42.499 --> 01:56:45.040
[SPEAKER_04]: Person dies while playing We Relax and the game never knew.

01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.901
[SPEAKER_04]: High score.

01:56:48.341 --> 01:56:50.362
[SPEAKER_04]: World record in We Relax.

01:56:52.443 --> 01:56:54.223
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's terrible.

01:56:54.483 --> 01:56:55.604
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, we should do that.

01:56:55.804 --> 01:56:57.824
[SPEAKER_13]: We should try to go for the world record.

01:56:58.184 --> 01:56:59.085
[SPEAKER_04]: In We Relax?

01:56:59.665 --> 01:57:00.625
[SPEAKER_04]: No, then we'll die.

01:57:00.705 --> 01:57:03.766
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way you're going to get the world record is to die while playing We Relax.

01:57:05.267 --> 01:57:05.847
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth it.

01:57:07.473 --> 01:57:07.553
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

01:57:07.873 --> 01:57:08.614
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

01:57:09.034 --> 01:57:09.374
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

01:57:09.534 --> 01:57:11.095
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the whole living thing, you know?

01:57:11.956 --> 01:57:13.236
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this idea better.

01:57:13.296 --> 01:57:15.537
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we go kill a million freaking zombies?

01:57:16.558 --> 01:57:17.839
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be super awesome.

01:57:17.859 --> 01:57:19.079
[SPEAKER_04]: That always makes a good game.

01:57:19.139 --> 01:57:21.801
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence why Left 4 Dead is so freaking amazing.

01:57:22.601 --> 01:57:31.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, what's going on here is that they're going to get characters from the original Left 4 Dead to now hang out with the...

01:57:32.126 --> 01:57:33.007
[SPEAKER_04]: New characters.

01:57:33.447 --> 01:57:42.353
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently the old characters and the new characters from Left 4 Dead 2 will meet in a game called The Passing, or a download content piece.

01:57:43.033 --> 01:57:45.735
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called The Most Important Campaign in the Left 4 Dead Story.

01:57:45.955 --> 01:57:48.857
[SPEAKER_04]: All the survivors are being called together in one campaign.

01:57:49.157 --> 01:57:51.399
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from the Valve VP of Marketing, Doug Lombardi.

01:57:51.679 --> 01:57:54.701
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to come out in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PC.

01:57:55.061 --> 01:57:57.883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have a co-op campaign in rural Georgia and...

01:57:58.163 --> 01:57:58.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:58:26.564 --> 01:58:28.825
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming to you right now is the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

01:58:28.865 --> 01:58:32.826
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the part of the show every week where we take some emails and read them for you live on air.

01:58:33.126 --> 01:58:33.606
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

01:58:34.547 --> 01:58:37.307
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, please open up the meal bag.

01:58:37.868 --> 01:58:38.088
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:58:38.568 --> 01:58:39.868
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't talk tonight.

01:58:40.729 --> 01:58:41.569
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm broken.

01:58:41.649 --> 01:58:42.549
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to be fixed.

01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:44.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in that way.

01:58:44.490 --> 01:58:48.031
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to get us... I need to wee relax is what I need to do.

01:58:48.111 --> 01:58:48.991
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to get us cupcakes.

01:58:50.412 --> 01:58:51.792
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not need a goddamn cupcake.

01:58:51.932 --> 01:58:53.973
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to get us cupcakes.

01:58:55.472 --> 01:58:57.074
[SPEAKER_13]: How's that gonna help me?

01:58:57.414 --> 01:59:00.577
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be doing a good deed, and it'll make you feel better in your heart.

01:59:00.717 --> 01:59:03.580
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't We Relax thinking about baseball anyways?

01:59:05.962 --> 01:59:09.005
[SPEAKER_10]: We Relax is mean... Think about it.

01:59:09.265 --> 01:59:13.329
[SPEAKER_13]: Getting through with the... And it makes your Wii relax.

01:59:15.731 --> 01:59:16.992
[SPEAKER_08]: They should do We Irritate.

01:59:17.112 --> 01:59:17.493
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag!

01:59:19.127 --> 01:59:24.308
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is sort of a mass email, so I'm going to go ahead and read it.

01:59:24.828 --> 01:59:25.648
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question.

01:59:25.728 --> 01:59:30.949
[SPEAKER_10]: If a kid has the money to get a console but no games, should the parent get the games for that console?

01:59:30.989 --> 01:59:32.629
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, it is an Xbox 360.

01:59:32.749 --> 01:59:34.770
[SPEAKER_10]: I can only survive on demos for so long.

01:59:35.230 --> 01:59:36.870
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, DSMaster26.

01:59:37.650 --> 01:59:37.950
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:41.171
[SPEAKER_10]: This is typed on a Wii with Wiimote, and I'm visually impaired, and lawsuits are disgraced.

01:59:41.191 --> 01:59:41.631
[SPEAKER_10]: Shame on him.

01:59:43.151 --> 01:59:43.491
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

01:59:43.831 --> 01:59:44.291
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

01:59:44.451 --> 01:59:47.212
[SPEAKER_01]: McDonald's is an equal opportunity employer.

01:59:48.208 --> 01:59:50.971
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a job and save up and buy yourself some games.

01:59:51.672 --> 01:59:53.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents don't have to buy you shit.

01:59:54.534 --> 02:00:04.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents might reward you with games or consoles or what have you if you've been a good little boy and or girl and you do chores around the house and what have you.

02:00:05.245 --> 02:00:11.231
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe you're in a household where you're fortunate enough to be spoiled to your heart's content like maybe Paris Hilton was when she was growing up.

02:00:11.631 --> 02:00:14.313
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that's not the way most of us have it.

02:00:14.393 --> 02:00:18.997
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, parents don't have to buy anything at all.

02:00:19.377 --> 02:00:26.362
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, keep in mind, in this economy of people losing their jobs and stuff, some parents can't afford to buy games at all.

02:00:26.462 --> 02:00:32.386
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you might be lucky to be getting a variety puzzle book from Penny Press.

02:00:32.466 --> 02:00:33.647
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's your game.

02:00:33.827 --> 02:00:38.190
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a Wii and an Xbox 360, you can sell one of them to get games for the other.

02:00:40.032 --> 02:00:40.272
[SPEAKER_10]: You know...

02:00:40.965 --> 02:00:47.667
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason I can get away with having all of these systems is because, well, until I hurt my hand, I had enough money to buy them.

02:00:48.347 --> 02:00:54.389
[SPEAKER_04]: In certain states, if you're like 14, you can get a work permit and go work at certain places.

02:00:54.429 --> 02:00:54.970
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:58.671
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bad idea because work experience goes a long way.

02:00:58.731 --> 02:01:05.973
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you might not want to work, but if you want a really cushy job in the future, working the crap jobs now help get you there faster.

02:01:07.113 --> 02:01:08.574
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just something to think about.

02:01:09.508 --> 02:01:11.229
[SPEAKER_10]: MoLons unless you have lethal allergies.

02:01:11.850 --> 02:01:13.231
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find something.

02:01:13.812 --> 02:01:26.562
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were skilled enough to type this email on a Wii or whatever, you probably can help old ladies and old men get their computers set up.

02:01:27.363 --> 02:01:30.465
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet there's a lot of things that you probably can still do.

02:01:30.986 --> 02:01:32.607
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you just have to look around for it.

02:01:32.747 --> 02:01:36.750
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, it's not like you can't start a change jar.

02:01:38.342 --> 02:01:43.224
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe your parents don't want you to get a job at 14, and that's their prerogative.

02:01:43.524 --> 02:01:46.745
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents didn't want me to have a job that young because they wanted me to focus on studying.

02:01:47.125 --> 02:01:50.326
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe try to work something out with your parents.

02:01:50.946 --> 02:01:51.826
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get an allowance?

02:01:52.007 --> 02:01:52.927
[SPEAKER_04]: I want this game.

02:01:53.007 --> 02:01:54.187
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I get this game?

02:01:54.227 --> 02:01:55.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get a job?

02:01:55.528 --> 02:01:57.328
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I do chores around the house?

02:01:57.748 --> 02:01:58.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get good grades?

02:01:59.449 --> 02:02:01.430
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something I got the answer to.

02:02:01.670 --> 02:02:05.451
[SPEAKER_04]: Your parents will raise you however they want and or can.

02:02:07.151 --> 02:02:22.314
[SPEAKER_04]: or you know and certainly in other cases you know when I say parents I mean whoever is caring for you right now your guardians etc etc just because there's many different types of families out there I just want to point that out the last one is big long email

02:02:23.114 --> 02:02:23.955
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, OLR Crew!

02:02:23.995 --> 02:02:31.538
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I probably can't make it to tonight's episode due to finals and such, I thought I'd email my review of the game I'd like to share with everyone.

02:02:32.138 --> 02:02:37.400
[SPEAKER_10]: Mushihime-sama Futari, a 2D bullet hell shooter from awesome folks at Cave.

02:02:38.181 --> 02:02:43.943
[SPEAKER_10]: For those who haven't been caught up on the recent shmup news, the recent Xbox 360 port of Futari is region-free.

02:02:44.483 --> 02:02:48.485
[SPEAKER_10]: Having heard this news, I pre-ordered my copy and received it within a week and a half of it shipping out.

02:02:48.965 --> 02:02:50.365
[SPEAKER_10]: So far, the game is mind-blowing.

02:02:50.825 --> 02:02:54.886
[SPEAKER_10]: After having played Touhou for a few months, Futari is especially pretty in comparison.

02:02:55.446 --> 02:02:57.847
[SPEAKER_10]: The games are very nicely detailed and vivid.

02:02:58.247 --> 02:03:02.508
[SPEAKER_10]: Although there is slowdown, it's implemented on purpose in order to make the game easier at times.

02:03:03.108 --> 02:03:08.289
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as play options and modes go, Futari offers a wide variety of them.

02:03:08.849 --> 02:03:15.451
[SPEAKER_10]: You can customize the game's display to your liking from the rotation of the screen for those dedicated enough to rotate their TVs for vertical shooters,

02:03:15.871 --> 02:03:16.552
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

02:03:34.891 --> 02:03:44.535
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there's Arrange Mode, a unique and complex twist on the regular gameplay, with the ability to switch characters as well as slow down bullets close to you and reflect them back to crank out tons of points.

02:03:45.436 --> 02:03:53.019
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're looking for stress relief or bad at shooters, there's the Novice Mode, a glorified easy mode that offers the easy versions of Original, Maniac, and Ultra.

02:03:53.499 --> 02:03:57.441
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried Novice, Ultra, and the bullet patterns are dense enough that you go, uh, wow.

02:03:58.141 --> 02:03:58.862
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

02:04:19.156 --> 02:04:20.296
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:04:40.914 --> 02:04:47.056
[SPEAKER_10]: It offers revised, original, and maniac modes, as well as a new god mode that is like Ultra Mode, but with somewhat less retardedness.

02:04:47.337 --> 02:04:47.837
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a word?

02:04:48.477 --> 02:04:49.277
[SPEAKER_10]: And new shot types.

02:04:49.477 --> 02:05:03.143
[SPEAKER_10]: While I like Black Label, I question whether it's worth the 1,200 Microsoft points, especially since I can get Raiden Fighters Aces 3 games in one for $5 more, or one of a handful of standalone shmups for anywhere between $5 and $10.

02:05:04.663 --> 02:05:11.189
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a dedicated Bullet Hell fan or have an Xbox 360 of any region lying around, you owe it to yourself to snap up a copy of Futari for $3.60.

02:05:11.489 --> 02:05:12.570
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, hey, $70?

02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:15.992
[SPEAKER_10]: At least you're not paying triple digits for the arcade hardware.

02:05:16.353 --> 02:05:18.594
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's from Ray Iannami, slash GS68.

02:05:18.675 --> 02:05:18.995
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

02:05:19.055 --> 02:05:22.818
[SPEAKER_10]: This email is brought to you by San Jose State University, home of the never-ending furlough days.

02:05:23.464 --> 02:05:24.805
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on the list of things to play.

02:05:25.385 --> 02:05:33.850
[SPEAKER_13]: The next one on my list other than Bayonetta for my Japanese region system was Oto Media's Gorgeous was the next one I wanted to play.

02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:36.832
[SPEAKER_13]: Then of course the one he mentioned was...

02:05:38.052 --> 02:05:38.753
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan's Monitor Rotates

02:05:58.388 --> 02:06:03.050
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, he's actually pulled out the monitor and rotated it to play, um, shmups.

02:06:03.930 --> 02:06:07.992
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think he got, like, uh, Raiden and Raiden 2 to run on MAME.

02:06:08.852 --> 02:06:10.873
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, he's, it works.

02:06:12.494 --> 02:06:12.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

02:06:14.195 --> 02:06:15.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, thank you for the review.

02:06:15.395 --> 02:06:16.035
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

02:06:16.095 --> 02:06:18.456
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, you can always send in your own game review if you want to.

02:06:18.536 --> 02:06:21.117
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send emails.

02:06:21.157 --> 02:06:22.198
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that it for emails tonight?

02:06:22.734 --> 02:06:23.314
[SPEAKER_06]: It was indeed.

02:06:23.354 --> 02:06:24.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then there you go.

02:06:24.415 --> 02:06:26.075
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's move on to some more stories.

02:06:26.095 --> 02:06:31.037
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:06:31.378 --> 02:06:32.338
[SPEAKER_04]: But not just yet.

02:06:32.638 --> 02:06:34.719
[SPEAKER_04]: For now, let's do some last few stories here.

02:06:36.039 --> 02:06:40.141
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, before we do stories, though... Oh, gosh, that's right.

02:06:40.161 --> 02:06:41.202
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to get to the angst.

02:06:41.222 --> 02:06:43.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not now, because DarkSakura just ran to use the potty.

02:06:43.482 --> 02:06:44.503
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll do the stories in the angst.

02:06:44.523 --> 02:06:46.204
[SPEAKER_13]: She went through a different type of angst.

02:06:46.244 --> 02:06:46.424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:06:49.282 --> 02:06:53.548
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, there's a rumor that NHL 2K11 may be cancelled.

02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:58.174
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe 2K Sports is in some sort of financial trouble.

02:06:59.336 --> 02:07:02.700
[SPEAKER_13]: This is coming from the recently released...

02:07:04.851 --> 02:07:07.713
[SPEAKER_13]: Take-Two's Q4 Fiscal 2009 results.

02:07:08.433 --> 02:07:12.935
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a section of games that the publisher is currently planning to ship in 2010.

02:07:13.616 --> 02:07:21.600
[SPEAKER_13]: Both MLB 2K10 and NBA 2K11 are listed on the report, although I would think it's... I can't remember if it's 2K9.

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:22.920
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I guess that's right there.

02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:23.781
[SPEAKER_13]: You're behind or whatever.

02:07:24.441 --> 02:07:24.721
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

02:07:26.322 --> 02:07:30.384
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, that NHL 2K11 is not on the list.

02:07:33.146 --> 02:07:33.547
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

02:07:33.567 --> 02:07:42.656
[SPEAKER_13]: And it says, we are currently in the process of evaluating our sports portfolio and have not announced any new NHL titles at this time.

02:07:43.597 --> 02:07:47.341
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, that's a pretty damning statement they put it.

02:07:48.222 --> 02:07:48.362
[SPEAKER_13]: And

02:07:49.733 --> 02:08:00.047
[SPEAKER_13]: Also saying that if NHL 2K is no more, the franchise appears to be dying the same death as, I guess, College Hoops 2K series.

02:08:00.067 --> 02:08:05.314
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're kind of slimlining, I guess, their portfolio as far as

02:08:07.039 --> 02:08:18.106
[SPEAKER_13]: And honestly, I'm kind of surprised with the NHL stuff, because I always thought the NHL 2K did a lot better than the EA's NHL games.

02:08:18.747 --> 02:08:22.189
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was a better put-together game.

02:08:22.209 --> 02:08:31.194
[SPEAKER_13]: At least my friend at work, who's really huge in the hockey, used to pick up the 2K series quite often, and he seemed to like it a lot better.

02:08:31.274 --> 02:08:32.875
[SPEAKER_13]: But, eh, who knows.

02:08:33.816 --> 02:08:33.896
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

02:08:35.168 --> 02:08:46.603
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, they're wondering that maybe 2K Sports as a publisher might be in some trouble as well, seeing as MLB 2K apparently didn't

02:08:47.867 --> 02:08:49.568
[SPEAKER_13]: All American Football 2K or whatever that sucked.

02:09:16.516 --> 02:09:17.036
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:09:41.332 --> 02:09:42.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:03.081
[SPEAKER_04]: Make your way to Champions Online right now

02:10:24.052 --> 02:10:28.194
[SPEAKER_13]: What is Warcraft doing for their holiday event?

02:10:28.434 --> 02:10:32.036
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of do the same thing they do usually during the holiday events.

02:10:32.876 --> 02:10:36.158
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it the festival something.

02:10:36.178 --> 02:10:36.698
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

02:10:37.478 --> 02:10:41.180
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to give everything very generic holiday names because they're not taken from the real world.

02:10:41.540 --> 02:11:00.306
[SPEAKER_04]: but they do holiday events pretty much the same every year but sometimes they add new things like a new boss or this year they added Thanksgiving event was brand new so you know they kind of go back to the calendar and add new things but they do holidays throughout the year all right anyhow um let's get to the FUs of the week because I missed doing it earlier and um but I just wanted to talk about teddy bears

02:11:16.764 --> 02:11:19.347
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, I've had a really great weekend.

02:11:20.809 --> 02:11:23.413
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, I can't really say F you to anything.

02:11:24.674 --> 02:11:27.978
[SPEAKER_10]: Except maybe, um, situations regarding a late paycheck.

02:11:28.739 --> 02:11:29.020
[SPEAKER_10]: And EBD.

02:11:30.293 --> 02:11:36.477
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard that California, like, I don't know about disability, but unemployment especially had some hurdles recently, too.

02:11:36.657 --> 02:11:37.878
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that affects it all ends of it.

02:11:37.898 --> 02:11:44.882
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm actually more pissed off at EDD for not sending me certain paperwork that I needed to fill out three weeks ago.

02:11:45.623 --> 02:11:48.545
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm still waiting on three weeks of pay.

02:11:48.825 --> 02:11:49.085
[SPEAKER_10]: Lame.

02:11:49.465 --> 02:11:53.508
[SPEAKER_10]: But starting next week, though, I'm back to getting some of my regular checks.

02:11:54.068 --> 02:11:54.328
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki!

02:11:56.554 --> 02:12:07.922
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, a few people that think it's necessary to put inflatable holiday, I don't even know what you'd call them, decorations out on their lawn and or house.

02:12:08.462 --> 02:12:10.784
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently it is just really prevalent this year.

02:12:11.348 --> 02:12:12.769
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they're all over the fucking place.

02:12:12.829 --> 02:12:17.272
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, our neighbor's house across the street decided, hey, you know what would be a great idea?

02:12:17.292 --> 02:12:20.494
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's put Frosty the Snowman on our roof with some presents.

02:12:20.654 --> 02:12:23.796
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like a giant fucking snowman is attacking the house.

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:26.457
[SPEAKER_13]: It is just retarded.

02:12:26.737 --> 02:12:29.459
[SPEAKER_04]: And people need to... Maybe that's the next Champions Online boss.

02:12:29.499 --> 02:12:29.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

02:12:29.879 --> 02:12:30.980
[SPEAKER_13]: They need to cut it back.

02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:40.306
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because they've got all sorts of playable things from, you know, giant snow globes to there's a guy in the corner that has Santa riding a Harley.

02:12:40.987 --> 02:12:56.427
[SPEAKER_13]: it's ridiculous and I mean it's just another thing that the holiday can barf onto your house because there's some people that have everything and they just keep adding every year and oh my god one house looks like they threw the lights just over the house and that's it it's sad

02:12:57.376 --> 02:12:59.437
[SPEAKER_04]: I like DarkSakura.

02:12:59.618 --> 02:13:02.860
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are pretty good for me right now, so I don't have a lot of angst, actually.

02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:06.742
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say, F you to mob mentality, especially on the internets.

02:13:07.483 --> 02:13:08.984
[SPEAKER_04]: God, some people are real sheep.

02:13:10.424 --> 02:13:13.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly I'm not talking about any of you, of course, folks listening, what have you.

02:13:13.546 --> 02:13:17.009
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just things I observe as I lurk on the internets.

02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:21.732
[SPEAKER_06]: I do also, though, think there should be an F you directed to that site, too.

02:13:23.269 --> 02:13:24.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, of course.

02:13:24.130 --> 02:13:26.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that goes... God, they got 20 minutes of an FU earlier.

02:13:26.771 --> 02:13:28.031
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to give them any more time.

02:13:28.632 --> 02:13:28.972
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:13:29.372 --> 02:13:30.933
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, how could we forget?

02:13:30.993 --> 02:13:31.673
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiara's here.

02:13:31.733 --> 02:13:33.774
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe she wants to get in on the angst tonight.

02:13:35.055 --> 02:13:38.296
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to say FU to people who deny the Holocaust.

02:13:39.977 --> 02:13:41.178
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how can you do that?

02:13:42.498 --> 02:13:43.359
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

02:13:43.379 --> 02:13:45.320
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm laughing because it's ridiculous.

02:13:46.148 --> 02:14:00.164
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a teacher, a PE teacher in Las Vegas was suspended for telling students that the Holocaust didn't exist and that photographs were doctored, textbooks are inaccurate, and that the Nazis lacked the technology to kill so many people.

02:14:00.644 --> 02:14:02.727
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I hope they fire her.

02:14:02.867 --> 02:14:03.588
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to that lady.

02:14:05.367 --> 02:14:05.767
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

02:14:06.628 --> 02:14:06.988
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

02:14:07.108 --> 02:14:08.189
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I can say is wow.

02:14:09.951 --> 02:14:10.271
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:14:10.351 --> 02:14:18.617
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of put, well, that's really bad, but the whole 9-11 conspiracy theories, like, come on.

02:14:19.198 --> 02:14:19.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

02:14:20.439 --> 02:14:26.163
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, first of all, in both situations, you've got first-person accounts from people who were there.

02:14:27.224 --> 02:14:29.686
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's ridiculous.

02:14:29.706 --> 02:14:29.946
[SPEAKER_10]: Ridiculous.

02:14:30.410 --> 02:14:31.851
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:14:54.466 --> 02:14:57.290
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing very well, and sounds like you guys are doing well too.

02:14:57.511 --> 02:14:58.973
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent, yes, actually we're doing pretty good.

02:14:59.213 --> 02:15:02.839
[SPEAKER_04]: When two of the three hosts have very little to rant about, it's usually a good night.

02:15:03.620 --> 02:15:04.721
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's on your mind?

02:15:05.082 --> 02:15:06.504
[SPEAKER_04]: To what do we owe this phone call tonight?

02:15:07.606 --> 02:15:07.926
[SPEAKER_00]: Well...

02:15:08.835 --> 02:15:14.677
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, as many people have been following, Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix is coming out this week.

02:15:14.937 --> 02:15:25.100
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we talked about it at the top of the show, of course, but for those that tuned in late, it's like a fan project dedicated to the show, which Loki, myself, and DarkSakura, we didn't do shit for this project.

02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:26.000
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't do anything.

02:15:27.261 --> 02:15:28.141
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not directly.

02:15:28.201 --> 02:15:33.683
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys created the shenanigans that is the show, and we kind of went with it.

02:15:34.203 --> 02:15:34.683
[SPEAKER_00]: So we...

02:15:36.712 --> 02:15:38.655
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I'm the lead developer, but you know what?

02:15:38.816 --> 02:15:41.260
[SPEAKER_00]: This has all been a group effort.

02:15:41.641 --> 02:15:44.767
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of listeners have contributed.

02:15:45.448 --> 02:15:48.975
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us two years, but I think we made a very great game.

02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:51.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, tell us about some of the thank yous.

02:15:52.002 --> 02:15:55.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are some of the people we need to give hugs and kisses to for making this game happen besides you?

02:15:59.508 --> 02:16:04.813
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, the hardcore listeners like, you know, we have Actdeft who worked on a couple songs.

02:16:04.853 --> 02:16:12.219
[SPEAKER_00]: We have DarkTetsuya, Misty, Breslul, who gave us the amazing announcer pack.

02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:13.500
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

02:16:14.884 --> 02:16:16.626
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of other people I can't even think of.

02:16:16.686 --> 02:16:19.289
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you really have to put that guy song in there though?

02:16:19.309 --> 02:16:23.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I saw that YouTube and I was like, what is this?

02:16:25.285 --> 02:16:26.166
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:16:54.670 --> 02:16:56.171
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside joke is, it's just John.

02:16:56.532 --> 02:16:57.592
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, okay, fair enough.

02:16:58.353 --> 02:17:04.118
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we have a lot of things in there from, you know, back from your old days from USL.

02:17:05.199 --> 02:17:05.799
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:06.600
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:08.041
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to talk about embarrassing stuff?

02:17:08.221 --> 02:17:14.407
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather the Like a Prayer stuff be released on, like, Entertainment Tonight than some of the old USL clips.

02:17:15.387 --> 02:17:18.670
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, we pretty much have everything that you've sung on there.

02:17:18.930 --> 02:17:19.311
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

02:17:21.052 --> 02:17:23.034
[SPEAKER_00]: Contributed by a certain Mr. Donovan.

02:17:23.784 --> 02:17:24.864
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.

02:17:25.024 --> 02:17:26.005
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.

02:17:26.325 --> 02:17:34.067
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, be glad we didn't know you back then because Travis had a way of getting you to make an ass out of yourself on the radio.

02:17:34.447 --> 02:17:35.687
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless Travis Donovan.

02:17:35.707 --> 02:17:38.768
[SPEAKER_04]: I would probably not be doing internet radio right now still if it were not for him.

02:17:38.788 --> 02:17:42.089
[SPEAKER_10]: I still remember the number one way to make him upset was to drop the C-bomb.

02:17:43.169 --> 02:17:43.909
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

02:17:44.029 --> 02:17:45.150
[SPEAKER_10]: And you kept doing it.

02:17:46.590 --> 02:17:48.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was my favorite word at the time.

02:17:49.291 --> 02:17:49.751
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow.

02:17:50.421 --> 02:17:55.622
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, Loki didn't get unscathed on this, so both of his performances are in the game.

02:17:55.962 --> 02:17:56.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God.

02:17:56.803 --> 02:17:59.523
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why I don't do karaoke on the internet.

02:17:59.543 --> 02:18:02.044
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you able to find anything embarrassing of DarkSakura?

02:18:03.444 --> 02:18:05.145
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, we haven't been able to.

02:18:05.445 --> 02:18:08.466
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our archivers, but no one was able to find anything.

02:18:08.686 --> 02:18:11.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask Travis for the apology song.

02:18:11.407 --> 02:18:11.807
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

02:18:13.567 --> 02:18:14.787
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

02:18:14.867 --> 02:18:16.668
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that would piss me off.

02:18:18.819 --> 02:18:20.940
[SPEAKER_07]: Beyond, piss her off with laughter.

02:18:23.001 --> 02:18:26.404
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why we have to get the bad stuff.

02:18:26.804 --> 02:18:29.185
[SPEAKER_10]: That's actually something that I'm still upset with him about.

02:18:30.346 --> 02:18:31.427
[SPEAKER_04]: Then don't ask him about that.

02:18:32.308 --> 02:18:35.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask him to hear it, just don't put it in the game.

02:18:37.071 --> 02:18:43.535
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things that we put in, we kind of made themed non-stop tracks of songs that are

02:18:44.272 --> 02:18:45.773
[SPEAKER_00]: That you guys would enjoy.

02:18:45.813 --> 02:18:48.255
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have a lot of songs from the Cage match.

02:18:48.275 --> 02:18:54.679
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of songs that, you know, you, Jamie, and Matt like.

02:18:54.719 --> 02:18:58.081
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's got pretty much everything in it.

02:18:58.121 --> 02:19:01.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Just an all ABBA course for me, of course.

02:19:01.983 --> 02:19:04.285
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we don't have a whole lot of ABBA in it.

02:19:04.525 --> 02:19:06.006
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, fine.

02:19:06.746 --> 02:19:07.347
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Skulk.

02:19:07.367 --> 02:19:08.428
[SPEAKER_00]: We know you like that.

02:19:08.568 --> 02:19:09.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

02:19:09.228 --> 02:19:09.828
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite.

02:19:09.848 --> 02:19:11.369
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Castlevania stuff for Jamie.

02:19:11.389 --> 02:19:11.710
[SPEAKER_00]: We have...

02:19:14.226 --> 02:19:18.508
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of Loki's remixes in there, so it's really got everything in it.

02:19:18.608 --> 02:19:19.149
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?

02:19:19.229 --> 02:19:20.529
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just end here.

02:19:20.589 --> 02:19:24.031
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually are planning on doing DLC for it.

02:19:24.532 --> 02:19:26.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, DLC.

02:19:26.273 --> 02:19:26.653
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

02:19:26.893 --> 02:19:32.756
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this is all free because it's kind of a ripoff of DDR in the first place, so you can't really charge for it.

02:19:32.796 --> 02:19:35.878
[SPEAKER_04]: But if the listeners want to grab it, how can they get a copy of the game?

02:19:36.769 --> 02:19:42.071
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the game comes out on Christmas Eve, so this will be a nice Christmas present for all the All Our fans.

02:19:42.371 --> 02:19:49.934
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be up on the website, in the forums, so you'll be able to download it, spread it out, give it to everyone to your heart's content.

02:19:50.287 --> 02:19:50.667
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

02:19:50.787 --> 02:19:52.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Spread it like a badass TD.

02:19:52.328 --> 02:19:55.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go out there and tell all your friends.

02:19:56.149 --> 02:20:08.112
[SPEAKER_04]: I truly think it's awesome that you guys have spent so much time on what some might view as a silly little project, but I kind of go, wow, the show actually people wanted to do that for our show?

02:20:08.392 --> 02:20:13.153
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't describe for you how neat that feels.

02:20:13.193 --> 02:20:15.234
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't have been able to do it without you guys.

02:20:15.534 --> 02:20:16.694
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys didn't do the show, then...

02:20:18.073 --> 02:20:20.954
[SPEAKER_00]: Nerds Hovering Around a Keyboard

02:20:48.172 --> 02:20:48.453
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:20:48.933 --> 02:20:54.455
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, SSJ100 Matt, is there anything else you want to say about the project or anything else going on in your week that you want to tell us about?

02:20:56.296 --> 02:20:56.776
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing really.

02:20:56.836 --> 02:21:04.820
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've just been playing the new crack game that I have is Modern Warfare 2 and, you know, plenty of NHL.

02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:09.622
[SPEAKER_00]: But aside from that, you know, working on this game so everyone can get it out on Christmas.

02:21:10.202 --> 02:21:11.763
[SPEAKER_00]: So aside from that.

02:21:12.685 --> 02:21:13.826
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there Iraqi suicide babies?

02:21:38.004 --> 02:21:38.985
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an old joke.

02:21:39.065 --> 02:21:39.625
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

02:21:39.805 --> 02:21:40.806
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say.

02:21:41.966 --> 02:21:43.487
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be the toasty thing that comes out.

02:21:43.527 --> 02:21:43.847
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:21:44.247 --> 02:21:47.989
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what other really, really old jokes do we have on the show?

02:21:48.049 --> 02:21:49.190
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to go way back.

02:21:50.430 --> 02:21:51.211
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Black Cock.

02:21:51.251 --> 02:21:51.791
[SPEAKER_04]: That's old.

02:21:51.831 --> 02:21:54.212
[SPEAKER_10]: The King of Iron Fingering.

02:21:54.392 --> 02:21:55.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a good embarrassing Jamie moment.

02:21:56.253 --> 02:21:58.835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but that was old and I don't care anymore.

02:21:58.855 --> 02:22:02.577
[SPEAKER_04]: She's over it now.

02:22:02.917 --> 02:22:05.318
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, definitely check out fans if

02:22:06.445 --> 02:22:10.771
[SPEAKER_00]: In the chat room and everyone, check out the Orange Lines Revolution YouTube channel.

02:22:11.773 --> 02:22:15.919
[SPEAKER_00]: We're posting up previews of everything and eventually we'll post up everything that's on there.

02:22:17.336 --> 02:22:17.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out now.

02:22:44.404 --> 02:22:47.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, they actually had the video of the Like a Prayer thing there?

02:22:48.346 --> 02:22:48.866
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

02:22:50.607 --> 02:22:51.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was it?

02:22:51.068 --> 02:22:51.868
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, here it is.

02:22:52.808 --> 02:22:55.050
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the great classics you can play in this game.

02:22:57.671 --> 02:22:58.471
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for it to buff.

02:23:06.315 --> 02:23:08.256
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like The Legend of Max, right, basically?

02:23:08.536 --> 02:23:09.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, wait.

02:23:19.244 --> 02:23:22.307
[SPEAKER_04]: or this one, Guyonora Waternal.

02:23:26.231 --> 02:23:26.952
[SPEAKER_04]: If it'll load.

02:23:27.132 --> 02:23:27.533
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:23:30.075 --> 02:23:32.218
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

02:23:32.698 --> 02:23:32.958
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy.

02:23:33.839 --> 02:23:33.999
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy.

02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:34.100
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy.

02:23:47.836 --> 02:23:50.686
[SPEAKER_04]: See, to someone who listens to Under Station Live, that's funny.

02:23:50.746 --> 02:23:53.837
[SPEAKER_04]: To the rest of us, we're like, what is that?

02:23:55.679 --> 02:23:57.360
[SPEAKER_00]: But you all know John, so you know.

02:23:58.100 --> 02:23:58.661
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

02:23:58.881 --> 02:24:00.782
[SPEAKER_04]: John needs to come back and visit.

02:24:01.142 --> 02:24:08.247
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I have heard rumors, I have heard rumblings, that the one and only Travis Donovan is considering a Sacramento visit.

02:24:08.707 --> 02:24:12.910
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have Travis Donovan on this very program.

02:24:13.911 --> 02:24:17.453
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could have sworn at one point he swore he would never come on Orange Floss Radio.

02:24:18.434 --> 02:24:19.555
[SPEAKER_04]: But that might have changed.

02:24:19.675 --> 02:24:23.277
[SPEAKER_04]: It's eight years now, and we may have him on the program.

02:24:23.357 --> 02:24:23.897
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be...

02:24:25.018 --> 02:24:25.759
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even explain.

02:24:25.779 --> 02:24:27.340
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be like DC and Marvel.

02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:31.383
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, set your TiVos now, kids.

02:24:31.683 --> 02:24:32.743
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be an amazing show.

02:24:35.145 --> 02:24:35.385
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:24:36.086 --> 02:24:39.548
[SPEAKER_04]: SJ100, Matt, thank you so much for the call, and thank you again for all your hard work in this project.

02:24:39.588 --> 02:24:40.309
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of fun.

02:24:40.349 --> 02:24:40.909
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.

02:24:41.189 --> 02:24:41.489
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:24:41.569 --> 02:24:41.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

02:24:42.610 --> 02:24:43.090
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, take care.

02:24:44.171 --> 02:24:44.732
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love that call.

02:24:44.992 --> 02:24:45.452
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:24:45.772 --> 02:24:46.613
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you.

02:24:46.713 --> 02:24:47.093
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

02:24:47.253 --> 02:24:47.674
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:24:47.894 --> 02:24:48.634
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

02:24:49.035 --> 02:24:49.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:24:50.301 --> 02:25:13.370
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want to give us a call and say your thanks or let us thank you for calling 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call again that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so you can go ahead and give us a call right now we're taking calls live while we wait for some calls since there is a little bit of a buffer between when we say things here in studio and when you guys hear them on the feed let's get some last minute stories Loki

02:25:13.530 --> 02:25:19.752
[SPEAKER_13]: The Sims 3 is releasing a tool to create your own worlds, so you can build your own towns in those said worlds.

02:25:20.432 --> 02:25:24.813
[SPEAKER_13]: And that'll be released soon, although I don't see when.

02:25:25.353 --> 02:25:25.693
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:25:26.613 --> 02:25:27.954
[SPEAKER_04]: Russell, Russell, Thumble, Thumble.

02:25:27.994 --> 02:25:28.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, caller, are you there?

02:25:28.874 --> 02:25:29.794
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on Orange Sounds Radio.

02:25:29.814 --> 02:25:30.534
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:25:30.814 --> 02:25:31.394
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, who is this?

02:25:31.414 --> 02:25:33.175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Deathwishing.

02:25:33.415 --> 02:25:34.255
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Deathwishing.

02:25:34.275 --> 02:25:34.875
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

02:25:36.416 --> 02:25:38.456
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first off, can I say an F you?

02:25:38.476 --> 02:25:41.057
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I kind of feel like I probably should have said this instead of what I said.

02:25:41.477 --> 02:25:41.717
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:25:41.737 --> 02:25:41.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:25:42.728 --> 02:25:45.889
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the Modern Warfare 2 hackers, you've ruined it for me.

02:25:46.209 --> 02:25:46.770
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they do?

02:25:49.451 --> 02:25:56.553
[SPEAKER_02]: The spin lately, I don't know if the patch has addressed it yet, but they've actually made it where certain playlists and stuff will put you into hacked games and stuff.

02:25:56.673 --> 02:26:01.875
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the third-person playlists on it, and I'm now getting put into 18-player free-for-all.

02:26:04.895 --> 02:26:12.465
[SPEAKER_02]: with unlimited noob tube people like unlimited ammo with noob tubes and then when someone gets an AC-130 it's just rapid fire.

02:26:16.371 --> 02:26:19.491
[SPEAKER_04]: I support hacking and cracking your own game.

02:26:19.631 --> 02:26:30.773
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to go hack Modern Warfare so that you jump to the sun whenever you jump or that you have infinite rockets or whatever, go for it.

02:26:31.013 --> 02:26:37.355
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you go and force that on other people in multiplayer to inflate your EP to make you feel better, that's just messed up.

02:26:37.375 --> 02:26:38.675
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what the rest of us are paying for.

02:26:39.724 --> 02:26:40.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stinks.

02:26:41.365 --> 02:26:42.385
[SPEAKER_04]: Hack it to your heart's content.

02:26:42.405 --> 02:26:43.346
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't go online with it.

02:26:44.566 --> 02:26:46.007
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also got a PS3.

02:26:46.607 --> 02:26:47.567
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, congratulations.

02:26:47.607 --> 02:26:48.588
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get any games for it?

02:26:49.628 --> 02:26:50.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

02:26:50.349 --> 02:26:50.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

02:26:50.729 --> 02:26:51.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you thinking?

02:26:51.369 --> 02:26:52.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you sent us a tweet earlier.

02:26:52.750 --> 02:26:55.811
[SPEAKER_02]: I rented Killzone 2.

02:26:56.351 --> 02:26:56.912
[SPEAKER_04]: And how was that?

02:26:57.912 --> 02:26:58.472
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.

02:26:59.373 --> 02:27:05.976
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you thought about... Now, you were asking us about a lot of retail games, but have you thought about any of the download stuff that PlayStation Network offers?

02:27:06.016 --> 02:27:08.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Bat Princess was the first thing that came to mind.

02:27:08.357 --> 02:27:08.657
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

02:27:08.757 --> 02:27:09.197
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get it?

02:27:10.057 --> 02:27:10.297
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:27:10.577 --> 02:27:12.038
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the money.

02:27:12.918 --> 02:27:13.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see then.

02:27:13.678 --> 02:27:17.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe for Christmas you'll get some money or some PSN cards and you can talk about it in a future show.

02:27:18.639 --> 02:27:22.580
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I found out an old thing you guys didn't think about, an old joke.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:23.260
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:24.941
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck exclamation points.

02:27:27.461 --> 02:27:27.681
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:27:28.542 --> 02:27:29.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you exclamation points?

02:27:29.602 --> 02:27:30.282
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't remember that?

02:27:31.042 --> 02:27:32.603
[SPEAKER_04]: The exclamation points?

02:27:33.343 --> 02:27:33.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:27:34.903 --> 02:27:35.683
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to explain.

02:27:35.763 --> 02:27:35.943
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:27:37.184 --> 02:27:38.384
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's hard to explain.

02:27:39.983 --> 02:27:44.326
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind Hold on, where's our Price is Right losing horn?

02:27:44.346 --> 02:27:53.593
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I just died a little bit You don't even want to try and explain what this is?

02:27:53.613 --> 02:28:03.040
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously you thought it was funny I don't really want to explain because I've been up for 32 hours What have you been up for 32 hours for?

02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:04.541
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my party

02:28:05.253 --> 02:28:08.695
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's your party and you'll make a fail call to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to.

02:28:08.755 --> 02:28:10.696
[SPEAKER_04]: So congratulations.

02:28:11.016 --> 02:28:12.177
[SPEAKER_04]: This fail horn is for you.

02:28:13.437 --> 02:28:16.879
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to kill myself.

02:28:16.959 --> 02:28:17.940
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to kill myself.

02:28:19.461 --> 02:28:20.281
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't kill yourself.

02:28:20.341 --> 02:28:21.062
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to bed.

02:28:21.562 --> 02:28:25.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Allison, the best thing, it's a 4chan meme.

02:28:26.624 --> 02:28:27.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

02:28:28.085 --> 02:28:30.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I really just let that onto this program?

02:28:30.306 --> 02:28:31.787
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I suppose it was inevitable at some point.

02:28:31.967 --> 02:28:32.508
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, whatever.

02:28:33.128 --> 02:28:33.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:28:36.297 --> 02:28:41.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Where there is a dark corner of the internet to be hiding in, there lies 4chan.

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:42.340
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you know?

02:28:42.761 --> 02:28:44.902
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hide there because I fail.

02:28:45.762 --> 02:28:47.443
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well congratulations on failing.

02:28:47.743 --> 02:28:49.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, have a good night, death wishing, and happy birthday.

02:28:50.725 --> 02:28:52.426
[SPEAKER_04]: They want your cupcakes, by the way.

02:28:53.466 --> 02:28:54.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I have 15 of them.

02:28:54.987 --> 02:28:55.628
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, later.

02:28:56.128 --> 02:29:01.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:01.431 --> 02:29:02.692
[SPEAKER_04]: Try not to have a fail call.

02:29:03.472 --> 02:29:04.953
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:29:07.408 --> 02:29:08.869
[SPEAKER_03]: No, okay, I'm done with that.

02:29:08.929 --> 02:29:10.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that really come from 4chan?

02:29:12.231 --> 02:29:17.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that whole thing, this is completely unrelated to why I'm calling, but this is Breslow, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.

02:29:17.813 --> 02:29:18.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi, Breslow, sorry.

02:29:19.334 --> 02:29:23.856
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume the listeners know that from the screechy voice we heard in guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy.

02:29:24.557 --> 02:29:24.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

02:29:25.617 --> 02:29:26.578
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate everybody.

02:29:27.378 --> 02:29:31.260
[SPEAKER_03]: I was red in the face when you were playing that, so now everybody thinks of me as this monster.

02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:35.542
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good, now you know how I feel when I saw the like a prayer thing on YouTube.

02:29:36.669 --> 02:29:38.130
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you want?

02:29:38.351 --> 02:29:38.491
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:29:38.531 --> 02:29:38.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Because...

02:30:05.230 --> 02:30:08.632
[SPEAKER_03]: We started a tradition two years ago on this very station.

02:30:11.273 --> 02:30:14.835
[SPEAKER_03]: We called it March Madness, but now since we started in January, we just call it Madness.

02:30:15.855 --> 02:30:21.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Best 80 games of all time square off in battle and only one survives.

02:30:21.178 --> 02:30:22.638
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year it was Super Mario Bros.

02:30:23.038 --> 02:30:28.161
[SPEAKER_03]: 3 and I'm officially opening the boat for nominations.

02:30:28.990 --> 02:30:32.199
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, so nominations are kicking off tonight, even though it's not 2010 yet.

02:30:32.359 --> 02:30:35.227
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you kicking off things a little early, DMN?

02:30:36.424 --> 02:30:43.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yes, because I have so much, I'm going to have so much stress in January, I want to get it started now.

02:30:44.148 --> 02:30:47.570
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's your shtick, you can do whatever the hell you want, DMN, you go.

02:30:47.590 --> 02:31:00.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but we're changing the voting around, so there could be, like, games like Rockman and DDR, now, I know a lot of people who listen to the show are huge Bimani fans, and that's nothing against them, but

02:31:00.976 --> 02:31:07.604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a problem when DDR is seated in the top 12 and Rock Band has seated in the top 5 for consecutive years.

02:31:08.084 --> 02:31:20.258
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're changing the formula a little bit to keep it a little bit more fair so we don't see games like Rock Band get all the way to the final four because a lot of people are like, this game doesn't really need to be here.

02:31:22.625 --> 02:31:24.227
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing different?

02:31:24.287 --> 02:31:26.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it a top secret formula?

02:31:27.069 --> 02:31:27.650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a secret.

02:31:27.810 --> 02:31:28.090
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

02:31:28.150 --> 02:31:29.891
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the herbs and spices at KFC.

02:31:29.951 --> 02:31:31.753
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to forever remain top secret.

02:31:32.133 --> 02:31:33.034
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a secret to everybody.

02:31:33.054 --> 02:31:36.117
[SPEAKER_04]: So go vote on something that you're not really sure how it works.

02:31:36.577 --> 02:31:39.439
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the end, there will be a winner that will be picked.

02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:40.100
[SPEAKER_03]: And Pi?

02:31:41.261 --> 02:31:45.224
[SPEAKER_03]: I have all the details of submitting your vote on OrangeLinesRadio.com right now.

02:31:45.364 --> 02:31:45.624
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

02:31:46.345 --> 02:31:50.669
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are any questions, they can also be directed to uslmadness at gmail.com.

02:31:51.873 --> 02:31:55.594
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be putting bracket details up probably in a couple of weeks.

02:31:55.694 --> 02:32:00.656
[SPEAKER_03]: But votes are open now, so vote early, but don't vote often because you can only vote once.

02:32:01.376 --> 02:32:01.976
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.

02:32:02.576 --> 02:32:02.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:32:03.217 --> 02:32:06.718
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is, why don't we just call this whole thing over and Super Metroid wins?

02:32:06.818 --> 02:32:08.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that is what should happen.

02:32:08.578 --> 02:32:10.739
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I agree with you.

02:32:10.919 --> 02:32:12.759
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Metroid is the greatest game of all time.

02:32:12.819 --> 02:32:17.521
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you that both years, and I will even tell you this year, it will be my top vote.

02:32:18.584 --> 02:32:21.465
[SPEAKER_03]: but when it gets beaten by crap like Tetris.

02:32:22.325 --> 02:32:25.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Tetris isn't crap, but it's just not Super Metroid.

02:32:26.366 --> 02:32:28.147
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Super Metroid.

02:32:28.187 --> 02:32:30.047
[SPEAKER_03]: I also had another reason I was calling in.

02:32:31.128 --> 02:32:32.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to promote anything.

02:32:32.128 --> 02:32:43.831
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a beef with video game marketing and since I've finally called into this show and tuned in for the first time in like five months, my game of the year this year was Borderlands.

02:32:44.732 --> 02:32:45.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Hands down.

02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:53.532
[SPEAKER_03]: But this game didn't get a lot of press because everyone's, you know, staining their pants about Modern Warfare 2.

02:32:53.812 --> 02:32:54.772
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest with you.

02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:57.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern Warfare 2 is not the best game I've played.

02:32:58.013 --> 02:32:59.473
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not the best game I've played this year.

02:32:59.493 --> 02:33:01.534
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not the best game I've played in the past five years.

02:33:02.374 --> 02:33:04.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern Warfare 2 is above average.

02:33:05.034 --> 02:33:05.695
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game.

02:33:06.715 --> 02:33:08.955
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not this amazing thing people make it out to be.

02:33:08.995 --> 02:33:12.016
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why it was this great thing everyone made it out to be is marketing.

02:33:13.556 --> 02:33:15.517
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish some of these games...

02:33:16.533 --> 02:33:18.694
[SPEAKER_03]: that were great got more marketing.

02:33:19.754 --> 02:33:34.079
[SPEAKER_03]: If Borderlands got the marketing it deserved, I think it would have sold more, people would have liked it more, and the game, from what I noticed, really got popular by a little bit of marketing and a little bit of word of mouth.

02:33:34.639 --> 02:33:40.481
[SPEAKER_03]: But you see games like Katamari Damacy, Psychonauts, gosh, what was the other one I had?

02:33:40.561 --> 02:33:42.202
[SPEAKER_03]: Okami would be a good example.

02:33:43.042 --> 02:33:44.823
[SPEAKER_03]: These games get fantastic reviews.

02:33:46.314 --> 02:33:49.115
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, in these days, that doesn't mean anything.

02:33:49.275 --> 02:33:50.036
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's depressing.

02:33:51.096 --> 02:33:51.957
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's weird, though?

02:33:52.077 --> 02:33:52.897
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it does.

02:33:52.957 --> 02:33:58.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I look at a game like Braid that really did everything based off of that word amount.

02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:07.565
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe that's the difference between download title and go into the store and drop $60 because, you know... And one question I usually ask people when they tell me a game's good, I say, well, is it $60 good?

02:34:07.585 --> 02:34:07.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it...

02:34:12.186 --> 02:34:16.227
[SPEAKER_03]: That stems from an old game on my show that Jimmy and I did on our old show way back.

02:34:16.727 --> 02:34:17.888
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I don't even want to remember.

02:34:18.448 --> 02:34:24.649
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had a segment called Actual Retail Price where we would name games that were coming out and we would say what we would actually pay for them.

02:34:25.709 --> 02:34:28.430
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some cases, I'd pay more than $60 for a game.

02:34:28.450 --> 02:34:31.131
[SPEAKER_03]: In a lot of cases, I'd maybe pay $40 for a game.

02:34:32.051 --> 02:34:33.451
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at a game like World of Warcraft.

02:34:33.551 --> 02:34:35.672
[SPEAKER_04]: I have paid more than $60 for that game.

02:34:35.692 --> 02:34:37.612
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I've paid more than I care to admit.

02:34:37.632 --> 02:34:37.692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:34:40.612 --> 02:34:43.033
[SPEAKER_03]: But Modern Warfare 2 was not a $60 game.

02:34:44.034 --> 02:34:45.074
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a $45 game.

02:34:46.155 --> 02:34:54.039
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to say it, but I needed to get that out because I'm sick... And Nintendo is so guilty of this.

02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:57.961
[SPEAKER_03]: All I have to say is Wii Music.

02:34:58.421 --> 02:35:01.643
[SPEAKER_03]: They marketed this as the greatest thing since sliced bread and it was crap.

02:35:01.963 --> 02:35:02.123
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

02:35:03.368 --> 02:35:04.889
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

02:35:28.587 --> 02:35:33.793
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in this decade alone, we've come to have to pay a lot more for our games.

02:35:33.833 --> 02:35:39.700
[SPEAKER_04]: We're paying now $60 for games, whereas at the beginning of the decade with the whole CD-based thing, we weren't paying so much before.

02:35:40.361 --> 02:35:42.403
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, the first game I paid $60 for...

02:35:43.604 --> 02:36:09.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter 2 on the Super Nintendo that's true first game I paid $60 for was Killer Instinct on the Super Nintendo I do realize that cartridge based games did raise that expectation earlier but CD was supposed to drop that and now it's come back up again it's very interesting we will talk about a little more of this next week as we start to kind of wrap up the year and the decade because it will be a slow news week you know that so more to come on that next week but thank you so much GMN we appreciate the call as always and keep up the good work with Under Sedation Live

02:36:10.772 --> 02:36:12.893
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't call it good work, but we'll keep up the work.

02:36:12.953 --> 02:36:13.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the fair work.

02:36:14.434 --> 02:36:15.695
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy New Year, guys.

02:36:15.895 --> 02:36:18.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if Travis does come out here, you should come with him.

02:36:18.476 --> 02:36:19.236
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm planning on it.

02:36:19.276 --> 02:36:21.777
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on synchronizing our trips.

02:36:21.858 --> 02:36:23.498
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have to just make it OLRCon.

02:36:23.598 --> 02:36:24.839
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll rent a hall or something.

02:36:25.099 --> 02:36:30.262
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll rent the Masonic Lodge and just throw ourselves a party.

02:36:30.322 --> 02:36:30.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good, man.

02:36:30.962 --> 02:36:31.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

02:36:31.202 --> 02:36:31.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

02:36:33.936 --> 02:36:48.850
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to do it for calls tonight sorry to those who didn't get through but remember you can't always send us an email or you can always give us an offline call or you can always send us an email bag, twitter, whatever you want to do there so sorry to those again who did not get through anyhow

02:36:50.751 --> 02:36:59.097
[SPEAKER_04]: We just... It's about time for us to wrap up the show, but I know Loki might have had some more last-minute stories he wants to get to, but he's too busy laughing over there at the frickin'... I'm not laughing over here.

02:36:59.197 --> 02:37:01.839
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was laughing at some stuff, but... Oh, okay.

02:37:02.059 --> 02:37:07.242
[SPEAKER_13]: I just... I like how they have I'm on a boat as one of the songs in there, and they have the video for it.

02:37:07.262 --> 02:37:07.342
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

02:37:11.605 --> 02:37:13.346
[SPEAKER_13]: Other things we'll mention real quick.

02:37:14.107 --> 02:37:24.396
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a game that was originally on the iPhone and the iPod Touch from a French independent developer called Press Start Studios.

02:37:24.556 --> 02:37:28.219
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a hack and slash game called Twin Blades, The Reaping Vanguard.

02:37:29.099 --> 02:37:30.521
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a really awesome looking game.

02:37:30.541 --> 02:37:33.983
[SPEAKER_13]: It's now coming to Xbox Live Indie Games.

02:37:35.705 --> 02:37:39.468
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you should pick it up just because it's incredibly beautiful.

02:37:39.548 --> 02:37:40.549
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all hand-drawn.

02:37:41.950 --> 02:37:43.251
[SPEAKER_13]: The game's coming out for $3.

02:37:45.934 --> 02:37:47.015
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely worth picking up.

02:37:47.375 --> 02:37:48.516
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like a pretty fun little game.

02:37:49.156 --> 02:37:50.818
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll have to look for the iPhone one.

02:37:51.513 --> 02:37:58.275
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the iPhone one is actually already out now and is actually out for 99 cents.

02:37:58.715 --> 02:38:03.157
[SPEAKER_13]: This one will be coming out apparently on Christmas.

02:38:03.857 --> 02:38:04.698
[SPEAKER_13]: So the 25th.

02:38:05.818 --> 02:38:06.418
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds kind of neat.

02:38:07.178 --> 02:38:19.923
[SPEAKER_13]: Assassin's Creed 2 is getting some download content that's going to kind of bridge the gap between the first and second games and they've added some new abilities including the Spring Jump and that's...

02:38:21.408 --> 02:38:27.214
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently two different contents between the end of January and the end of February.

02:38:27.614 --> 02:38:33.100
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to have the Battle of Forli and that's going to be for $3.99.

02:38:35.579 --> 02:38:41.044
[SPEAKER_13]: and also, I guess, Bonfire of Vanities, which will run you $4.99.

02:38:42.925 --> 02:38:52.613
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess it's speculated that the two editions will fill in the missing sequence 12 and 13 from the game.

02:38:53.114 --> 02:38:54.295
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's neat.

02:38:55.976 --> 02:39:00.820
[SPEAKER_13]: And lastly, the 3D Blu-ray specs have been finalized.

02:39:01.581 --> 02:39:03.763
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is going to be kind of going forward...

02:39:05.973 --> 02:39:18.020
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if they're going to start this next year, but obviously the big trend in entertainment nowadays is 3D, and they're going to be bringing that to you with Blu-ray.

02:39:19.730 --> 02:39:29.960
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the things that they did include with, of course, the Blu-ray specs is going to be that the 3D will be supported on the PlayStation 3.

02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:35.565
[SPEAKER_13]: So soon you'll be able to, I guess, watch 3D movies on your PlayStation 3.

02:39:35.946 --> 02:39:37.727
[SPEAKER_13]: Makes sense since they have...

02:39:38.468 --> 02:40:08.074
[SPEAKER_13]: similar technology right now available for the Avatar game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 assuming you had the TV to support it and had the glasses that go with it but actually I mean some of those TVs because the Avatar game supported like all sorts of different methods for it one of which is RealD and I didn't even realize that RealD is available for TVs and those glasses are dirt cheap I mean hell you get them you know you go see a 3D movie in the theater you get a free pair of you know those polarized glasses

02:40:08.174 --> 02:40:10.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't you supposed to turn them into the bucket at the end so they can be steamwashed?

02:40:10.675 --> 02:40:10.955
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that.

02:40:11.055 --> 02:40:14.576
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm paying extra money for, you know, the movie.

02:40:15.216 --> 02:40:16.516
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm keeping those damn glasses.

02:40:17.636 --> 02:40:19.457
[SPEAKER_13]: But yes, for Avatar, I did recycle them.

02:40:19.517 --> 02:40:21.317
[SPEAKER_13]: I did have some before, just in case.

02:40:21.517 --> 02:40:22.077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I stole one.

02:40:22.117 --> 02:40:24.378
[SPEAKER_10]: I did have a pair from Disneyland that I accidentally held on to.

02:40:24.398 --> 02:40:28.759
[SPEAKER_13]: If I ever get a TV, though, that does support Real D, I'm keeping those damn glasses.

02:40:29.156 --> 02:40:33.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of 3D and Disneyland, we've got a planned trip in February, y'all.

02:40:33.206 --> 02:40:34.088
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess who's coming back?

02:40:34.108 --> 02:40:36.032
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, did you see Princess Tiana?

02:40:36.453 --> 02:40:37.696
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, I was so excited!

02:40:39.952 --> 02:40:42.473
[SPEAKER_04]: She let me pretend to be the prince, even though the prince was standing right there.

02:40:42.933 --> 02:40:43.454
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

02:40:43.494 --> 02:40:46.915
[SPEAKER_04]: But my female friend that was with me, she posed with the prince, so it worked out.

02:40:46.935 --> 02:40:48.116
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have posed with the prince, too.

02:40:48.556 --> 02:40:50.997
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have, but there were all these little kids around.

02:40:51.037 --> 02:40:56.239
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the parents would appreciate those types of questions, so we'll just leave it at that.

02:40:56.680 --> 02:41:04.183
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I obviously had a good time, and I'm excited to go back next year because we've got to see Captain EO.

02:41:04.943 --> 02:41:05.644
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to happen.

02:41:06.104 --> 02:41:08.725
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you guys, Captain EO is officially coming back in February.

02:41:09.432 --> 02:41:12.093
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:41:32.839 --> 02:41:34.321
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about that kind of caught my ear.

02:41:34.401 --> 02:41:37.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, okay, and this Captain EO thing has been announced for a limited run.

02:41:38.146 --> 02:41:40.490
[SPEAKER_04]: What has already been planned for next?

02:41:40.510 --> 02:41:44.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this means something's already been planned for 2011 for that theater.

02:41:44.315 --> 02:41:46.278
[SPEAKER_04]: So Captain EO's going to be there, but only for about a year.

02:41:47.059 --> 02:41:48.120
[SPEAKER_04]: Then something else is coming.

02:41:48.601 --> 02:41:49.121
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a theory.

02:41:50.049 --> 02:41:50.510
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a theory.

02:41:50.970 --> 02:41:51.671
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your theory?

02:41:51.751 --> 02:41:52.833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Tomorrowland, right?

02:41:53.213 --> 02:41:53.414
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

02:41:53.514 --> 02:41:55.717
[SPEAKER_04]: Pixar is a big thing right now.

02:41:56.218 --> 02:41:59.742
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess it's a WALL-E movie would take that theater.

02:41:59.823 --> 02:42:01.545
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a WALL-E movie would be pretty rad.

02:42:01.765 --> 02:42:02.767
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.

02:42:02.887 --> 02:42:04.990
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my bet, is a WALL-E movie replaces Captain Neo.

02:42:06.261 --> 02:42:10.603
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was my way, it'd be Tron, and they'd reopen the monorail and actually make it a good Tron ride.

02:42:10.683 --> 02:42:11.403
[SPEAKER_04]: The PeopleMover?

02:42:11.583 --> 02:42:13.664
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG, yes, please.

02:42:13.864 --> 02:42:14.944
[SPEAKER_04]: So much this.

02:42:15.345 --> 02:42:16.445
[SPEAKER_04]: So much this.

02:42:17.005 --> 02:42:26.769
[SPEAKER_10]: If it wasn't for that stupid guy who decided to dive off the wrong side of it, we would still have us a PeopleMover, and we would still have us the Tron thing, which was the only good part about the PeopleMover.

02:42:27.069 --> 02:42:30.193
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to make this the Disney show, but we're at the end of the show anyway.

02:42:30.213 --> 02:42:30.954
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot left.

02:42:31.274 --> 02:42:32.316
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this real quick.

02:42:32.396 --> 02:42:39.644
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I did see at Disneyland that just opened up Friday, reopened up I should say, all new, all completely redone.

02:42:39.684 --> 02:42:40.505
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very impressed.

02:42:40.565 --> 02:42:42.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln is back.

02:42:42.768 --> 02:42:43.849
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:43:03.144 --> 02:43:03.745
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna have to do it.

02:43:03.845 --> 02:43:06.787
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hope that's not Evil Lincoln, who will murder us all.

02:43:06.827 --> 02:43:07.928
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not Evil Lincoln!

02:43:07.988 --> 02:43:14.132
[SPEAKER_13]: I especially love the part when President Lincoln stands up and does his rendition of Lady Gaga's poker face.

02:43:16.614 --> 02:43:18.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Starts mimicking the Bad Romance video, yes.

02:43:18.495 --> 02:43:19.356
[SPEAKER_13]: It really hit me.

02:43:19.816 --> 02:43:21.237
[SPEAKER_01]: In the voice of Christopher Walken.

02:43:22.298 --> 02:43:22.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

02:43:23.899 --> 02:43:26.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, there you go.

02:43:26.881 --> 02:43:32.165
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my little snap Disney review, but they have water back at California Venture.

02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:36.521
[SPEAKER_04]: The main walkway at California Adventure is closed.

02:43:36.561 --> 02:43:37.961
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go all the way around to get anywhere.

02:43:39.341 --> 02:43:41.042
[SPEAKER_04]: California Adventure, I have a cry.

02:43:41.122 --> 02:43:44.503
[SPEAKER_04]: But they really are getting that park ready for 2011.

02:43:45.223 --> 02:43:46.103
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

02:43:46.563 --> 02:43:47.143
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

02:43:47.964 --> 02:43:49.044
[SPEAKER_04]: Aladdin is also closing.

02:43:49.244 --> 02:43:52.705
[SPEAKER_04]: It's announced that the Aladdin show at California Adventure is going to close in August.

02:43:52.845 --> 02:43:54.165
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably going to Broadway.

02:43:54.465 --> 02:43:55.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't cry too much.

02:43:55.285 --> 02:43:56.926
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in London's West End right now.

02:43:57.866 --> 02:43:59.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam Anderson is playing the genie.

02:43:59.486 --> 02:44:00.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, what?

02:44:00.627 --> 02:44:01.007
[SPEAKER_04]: But okay.

02:44:01.027 --> 02:44:01.067
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

02:44:02.307 --> 02:44:04.412
[SPEAKER_04]: but a Toy Story musical is going to replace it.

02:44:04.953 --> 02:44:05.414
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

02:44:05.575 --> 02:44:06.357
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we'll see.

02:44:06.798 --> 02:44:10.286
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, Toy Story 3 is in the works.

02:44:11.934 --> 02:44:17.760
[SPEAKER_10]: So... Oh, I'll say about Toy Story 3, they're actually going to be doing an IMAX releases for that.

02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:18.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, the 3D.

02:44:18.561 --> 02:44:20.363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they did the 3D preview for it.

02:44:20.623 --> 02:44:21.204
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good times.

02:44:21.344 --> 02:44:23.706
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, again, how does this relate to video games?

02:44:24.067 --> 02:44:25.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Movie-video game tie-ins.

02:44:25.428 --> 02:44:31.615
[SPEAKER_04]: And the technology, just like Loki's saying about Avatar, you know, this type of technology you're seeing in Avatar is already in the game.

02:44:31.675 --> 02:44:34.197
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that it's probably too expensive for a lot of you guys to afford.

02:44:34.758 --> 02:44:35.338
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D, Midway Mania

02:44:54.403 --> 02:44:55.544
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably do a little bit of both.

02:44:55.984 --> 02:44:57.544
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if we'll have any special guests yet.

02:44:57.564 --> 02:44:58.845
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to line up some folks.

02:44:58.885 --> 02:45:00.226
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens over the next week.

02:45:00.266 --> 02:45:05.908
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will be back live again on All Games Radio on the 27th with our last episode of The Decade.

02:45:07.148 --> 02:45:10.770
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can believe it, we've been doing this show most of the decade.

02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:12.951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of strange.

02:45:13.976 --> 02:45:15.857
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've hit seven years.

02:45:16.518 --> 02:45:16.818
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

02:45:16.918 --> 02:45:19.560
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year will be the eighth year of broadcasting.

02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:23.802
[SPEAKER_04]: 2002 to 2010 and beyond.

02:45:23.962 --> 02:45:24.562
[SPEAKER_11]: We're bored.

02:45:26.043 --> 02:45:31.567
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, before we close up shop tonight, of course, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts here in studio.

02:45:31.607 --> 02:45:33.187
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

02:45:33.888 --> 02:45:34.648
[SPEAKER_10]: I want cupcakes.

02:45:36.049 --> 02:45:37.050
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys and cupcakes.

02:45:37.570 --> 02:45:41.672
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, at the grocery store, there's a box that says Betty Crocker on it.

02:45:41.852 --> 02:45:42.453
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll help you out.

02:45:44.333 --> 02:45:45.394
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought, please.

02:45:47.775 --> 02:45:48.115
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

02:45:49.676 --> 02:45:51.237
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiara, your final thought, please.

02:45:51.277 --> 02:45:52.857
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being here tonight.

02:45:53.178 --> 02:45:54.298
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me borrow that top.

02:45:55.319 --> 02:45:55.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Betch.

02:45:56.039 --> 02:45:57.300
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys see the backside.

02:45:57.320 --> 02:45:58.360
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wearing my Kelly shirt tonight.

02:45:58.740 --> 02:45:59.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a betch.

02:46:00.141 --> 02:46:00.701
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

02:46:01.022 --> 02:46:01.262
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:46:01.402 --> 02:46:03.443
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:46:04.103 --> 02:46:04.863
[SPEAKER_09]: He just said he didn't know.

02:46:04.903 --> 02:46:05.764
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought he had a real one.

02:46:05.784 --> 02:46:06.844
[SPEAKER_09]: He forfeited it.

02:46:07.145 --> 02:46:07.985
[SPEAKER_04]: He started to say something.

02:46:08.045 --> 02:46:09.006
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have anything.

02:46:09.026 --> 02:46:09.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:46:09.326 --> 02:46:09.746
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then fine.

02:46:12.128 --> 02:46:12.469
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

02:46:12.829 --> 02:46:13.690
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to close up shop.

02:46:14.031 --> 02:46:14.571
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.

02:46:14.612 --> 02:46:15.373
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do it all again.

02:46:15.413 --> 02:46:19.058
[SPEAKER_04]: Our 350th decade end episode.

02:46:19.318 --> 02:46:20.360
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob better bring cupcakes.

02:46:22.719 --> 02:46:25.480
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:29.280
