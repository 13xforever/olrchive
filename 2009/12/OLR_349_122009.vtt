00:00.000 --> 00:19.540
Today, December 20th, 2009, is a leaked survey hinting at a paid Playstation network?

00:19.540 --> 00:31.600
What video game related show will soon be on PBS?

00:31.600 --> 00:35.040
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.040 --> 00:36.040
Radio.

00:36.040 --> 00:40.200
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:40.200 --> 00:41.200
lifestyle.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.720
With you as always over the next few hours here on All Games Radio where we tape live.

00:44.720 --> 00:50.200
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me is the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.200
How are you?

00:51.200 --> 00:52.200
I'm alright.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
You alright?

00:53.200 --> 00:54.200
Hi.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.200
A little irritated.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.420
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:56.420 --> 00:57.420
Not at me?

00:57.420 --> 00:58.420
Did I do something?

00:58.420 --> 00:59.420
No.

00:59.420 --> 01:00.420
Okay, I was just saying if I ruffled your feathers I'm extremely sorry.

01:00.420 --> 01:01.420
No.

01:01.420 --> 01:02.420
Not at you.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.120
Well the show hasn't really started yet so maybe at the end of the show you'll be mad

01:04.120 --> 01:05.120
at me.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
We'll see.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Mom.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.440
I'll try not to though.

01:08.440 --> 01:11.640
Alright and of course say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

01:11.640 --> 01:12.640
Hi.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.160
Who's chowing down on wings right now.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.160
Yes.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
Alright.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.160
He's barbecuing.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.160
He's been craving them all week.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.160
Have you really?

01:19.160 --> 01:20.160
Yeah.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.160
Now the whole room smells like barbecue and damn I am hungry.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.160
That's alright.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.160
They're yummy.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.160
Maybe I'll get a taco after the show.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.160
Well thank you.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.160
That makes me feel a lot better to know.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.160
At least you're having yummy food.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.160
How have you been Loki?

01:28.160 --> 01:29.160
I've been fine.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.160
Alright.

01:30.160 --> 01:38.840
We are back of course on Sunday night taping live at All Games Radio www.allgames.com.

01:38.840 --> 01:43.060
We tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, or thereabouts right after the Bobby

01:43.060 --> 01:44.440
Black Wolf show.

01:44.440 --> 01:48.160
Our old friend Bobby Black Wolf who does a one man band show right before us at 5 o'clock

01:48.160 --> 01:49.200
Pacific.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.920
Although we're starting a little late tonight because we were talking about Game of the

01:51.920 --> 01:53.040
Decade with Bobby.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.180
That was kind of the focus of his show tonight because he's got next week off.

01:56.180 --> 01:58.760
And we were talking about Game of the Decade a little bit on his show.

01:58.760 --> 02:02.760
So if you haven't already listened to his show for the week, be sure you do at some

02:02.760 --> 02:07.280
point by checking out thebobbyblackwolfshow.com and downloading his show because we make

02:07.280 --> 02:08.280
a cameo.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.280
I don't know if you guys know this.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.200
We make a cameo on his show like every week that we have a show as well.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.800
He's been very good about always kind of having a little toss over to us live.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.920
So please support our friend Bobby Black Wolf and also the other fabulous programs they

02:19.920 --> 02:20.920
have at All Games Radio.

02:20.920 --> 02:21.920
And I always say this.

02:21.920 --> 02:27.160
If this is your first time listening to All Games Radio or listening to Orange Lounge

02:27.160 --> 02:30.220
Radio which is a part of that, if this is your first time listening to this show because

02:30.220 --> 02:33.840
maybe a friend sent you over here and you don't know really what the show is about and

02:33.840 --> 02:37.200
you decide to listen to this show tonight, damn these guys suck.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.280
They don't talk about anything I really want to hear about and the games they play are

02:40.280 --> 02:41.440
not the games I play.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.440
You know what?

02:42.440 --> 02:46.800
Go check out a different show at All Games Radio because there's lots of great independently

02:46.800 --> 02:49.320
produced shows that do talk about those other games.

02:49.320 --> 02:53.120
I'm going to admit we're not really going to bring you a lot of chat on Modern Warfare

02:53.120 --> 02:54.120
2.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.120
It's just not the kind of game I play.

02:55.120 --> 02:58.560
I don't think Dark Soccer is really down with the Call of Duty's of the world.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
I like Call of Duty.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.560
Do you?

03:00.560 --> 03:02.280
I get motion sick but I like watching Dan play.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.280
Okay well fair enough then.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.360
But you know we have differing opinions sometimes and I'm not saying that's a bad game.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.360
Heck no.

03:08.360 --> 03:12.160
It's not really a game I have time to play because there's so many other games I try

03:12.160 --> 03:15.840
to squeeze in, both retro and current games.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.160
Anyhow, speaking of games, let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the games

03:20.160 --> 03:21.160
that we've been playing this week.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.160
Dark Sakura.

03:22.160 --> 03:27.040
I played Super Mario Wii which is pretty cool if annoying playing multiplayer.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.440
I don't know I just found the multiplayer aspect to be really irritating so it wasn't

03:31.440 --> 03:34.120
fun for me that way.

03:34.120 --> 03:39.680
And a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 which if you ignore the whole Civil War

03:39.680 --> 03:42.120
storyline it's actually a really fun game.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.520
I hated the Civil War storyline so.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.200
I'm so glad you finally got around to that because I knew we were talking on last week's

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
show kind of joking.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.680
I still haven't played this game but I'm glad you finally were able to do it.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.280
We played a decent bit of it.

03:54.280 --> 04:06.560
And I played of course my peggle a bunch and some solitaire and Dan was showing us the

04:06.560 --> 04:12.920
whole zombie thing in Borderlands and doing the brain hunting thing and like it's kind

04:12.920 --> 04:18.000
of funny because the more you have to go back you like find this the one of the characters

04:18.000 --> 04:22.160
buddies who's been turned into a zombie and he's tied to his chair so you have to bring

04:22.160 --> 04:25.640
him brains to eat and he keeps asking for more brains.

04:25.640 --> 04:31.040
So as you you start bringing him you know 10 brains and 25 and 50 and as it keeps going

04:31.040 --> 04:42.160
the eh it goes brains for the name of the thing and but I really I don't know I think

04:42.160 --> 04:45.760
I would be happier playing Mario Wii by myself.

04:45.760 --> 04:46.800
It just.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.800
It can get a little frustrating with you know all the chaos going on.

04:50.800 --> 04:55.480
It gets a lot of frustrating because all I want to do is just to do what I'm doing you

04:55.480 --> 04:58.400
know and it's irritating.

04:58.400 --> 05:02.440
It's a bummer there's not a game like that on the DS where everybody can kind of do their

05:02.440 --> 05:06.440
own thing on their own screen but yet maybe you're still working together and I think

05:06.440 --> 05:09.480
it's for that real element that you're stuck on that screen.

05:09.480 --> 05:13.280
I mean it's both a blessing and a curse you know.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.640
Well if that is it for your gaming week.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.480
Oh yeah and I played some World of Warcraft.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.480
There you go.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.160
And how about the one and only Techmaster Loki.

05:22.160 --> 05:26.420
I didn't play a whole lot this week and not as much as I'd want to finishing up Christmas

05:26.420 --> 05:28.580
gifts and stuff.

05:28.580 --> 05:39.000
So I played you know Grand Theft Auto, Baligate Tony multiplayer kicking ass constantly in

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
that game.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
There's.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.800
It's funny because we play with you know we've been playing ranked matches now so anybody

05:44.800 --> 05:54.480
can join us is you know play around 10 o'clock you know Pacific and 3 p.m. Pacific each day.

05:54.480 --> 05:59.440
So if you just pretty much just join a you know ranked deathmatch game you're probably

05:59.440 --> 06:01.360
going to get into ours.

06:01.360 --> 06:06.840
And it's funny because we laugh at the people that play with us because most of the time

06:06.840 --> 06:10.040
they end up dropping because we're just so intense in the game.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.800
I mean not that we're talking trash them we don't have microphones or anything but we

06:12.800 --> 06:16.200
just kick the crap out of everybody.

06:16.200 --> 06:20.000
Mainly I kick the crap out of everybody but you know there's a little bit coming my way

06:20.000 --> 06:22.620
but it's funny.

06:22.620 --> 06:25.440
And I don't know.

06:25.440 --> 06:29.960
Anyways other than that we've been playing I played more Bayonetta and it's awesome.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.200
I like some of this stuff later on in the game.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.260
You can actually buy new techniques and stuff and one of the techniques I unlocked is like

06:37.260 --> 06:41.880
windmill you know like the breakdancing moves so you spin around with the guns blazing on

06:41.880 --> 06:45.720
your feet or whatever and then she stops and does a freeze pose.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.040
It's awesome.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.120
It's this game is awesome.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.600
I know I'm so excited.

06:51.600 --> 07:00.080
And then completely off of the Xbox 360 I actually played a little bit of salt which

07:00.080 --> 07:03.280
is the new game that's in sodium one.

07:03.280 --> 07:08.120
Honestly had no idea what the hell sodium is and to be honest and I know we're going

07:08.120 --> 07:13.320
to talk about this more later on it wasn't that big a deal to me.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.320
I don't know.

07:14.320 --> 07:19.680
I played that game salt kind of like a hovercraft action game or something like that where you're

07:19.680 --> 07:24.920
blowing up other robotic hovercrafts and stuff and it was neat for a little bit.

07:24.920 --> 07:30.360
You know that's it but it's not something I'd like consistently play.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.440
Well I know we're going to get into it a little later in the show.

07:32.440 --> 07:36.920
I played a little bit of that this week as well and you know although I think the game

07:36.920 --> 07:41.320
itself was a little like I think I played a game like this on the Atari 2600 so this

07:41.320 --> 07:42.840
is a little more souped up you know.

07:42.840 --> 07:48.640
I think technically it's doing some things that we haven't seen home do yet and it's

07:48.640 --> 07:52.040
kind of exciting but we'll get into that a little later.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.080
So yeah that's basically it.

07:55.080 --> 08:01.200
I was going to play some other games on my main cabinet I did try I wanted to play alligator

08:01.200 --> 08:06.160
which is our alligator hunt which I've never heard of the game but it's pretty cool it's

08:06.160 --> 08:14.640
kind of like a shooter I guess an on rails shooter thing and it was kind of neat but

08:14.640 --> 08:19.640
I can't get the ROM to work right I'm doing something wrong with my settings or something

08:19.640 --> 08:25.720
but I don't know it'll be cool.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.560
Well let's see my gaming week obviously if you were listening to last week's show I got

08:29.560 --> 08:35.320
that awesome FC Mobile as a gift for the holidays and I went out on a little bit of a binge

08:35.320 --> 08:41.320
I bought some 8-bit games and I borrowed from the vault so I had NES games galore back at

08:41.320 --> 08:46.320
home including an awesome purchase I made at a local games store I went to where you

08:46.320 --> 08:50.040
suggested Jamie and I don't know if I told you what I got there I don't think I did after

08:50.040 --> 08:54.040
last week but I went to that store we talked about and I don't know if you want to say

08:54.040 --> 09:00.900
it on air or not but I went and got Goonies 2 on the NES which is a game I just remember

09:00.900 --> 09:05.520
for you know it wasn't a spectacular I think when it came out but I think it was also underrated

09:05.520 --> 09:08.640
because a lot of people said what the hell does this have to do with the movie but it

09:08.640 --> 09:14.720
actually was a pretty cool game I also bought Slippeed for the Sega CD which I knew which

09:14.720 --> 09:19.800
I knew Dark Sakura would very much approve of I haven't been able to hook that all up

09:19.800 --> 09:23.240
because I don't have the Sega CD hooked up and I've been very lazy on that because I

09:23.240 --> 09:28.680
was out of town this weekend but that's on my to-do list for the week but 8-bit games

09:28.680 --> 09:34.480
yes I've been binging on a lot of those Rygar on the NES I borrowed from the vault Guardian

09:34.480 --> 09:40.960
Legend of course came from Loki with the system and also picked up which I think is Faxanadu

09:40.960 --> 09:44.640
but I think it's actually Fashanadu or something like that I think the X has a different pronunciation

09:44.640 --> 09:50.440
to it which is a game I remember from my childhood also borrowed that from the vault good times

09:50.440 --> 09:55.120
good 8-bit times so I'm like totally reminiscing this week going to our chat room of course

09:55.120 --> 10:01.000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com the always present fourth guest on the show also commenting on

10:01.000 --> 10:05.480
what's going on tonight start off with Tiger Claw tonight Goonies 2 is a great platform

10:05.480 --> 10:11.400
game but it had those annoying 3D sections yeah especially the front and back thing got

10:11.400 --> 10:16.860
really irritating but you know it wasn't perfect but it still was a game that's out of my memory

10:16.860 --> 10:21.880
but I get what he's saying also as far as my gaming week goes not a whole lot of other

10:21.880 --> 10:26.480
new stuff a little bit of World of Warcraft a little bit of DJ Hero I played that earlier

10:26.480 --> 10:30.640
in the week and got some trophies because I really like DJ Hero it's one of my favorite

10:30.640 --> 10:35.160
games to have come out this year and I don't understand why people are like hating why

10:35.160 --> 10:40.120
it's cool to hate on DJ Hero all of a sudden because maybe it's not selling zillions of

10:40.120 --> 10:45.920
copies like Guitar Hero and Rock Band do I mean I think a lot of this came from those

10:45.920 --> 10:50.520
silly VGA awards that happened was it last week oh yeah that's right because we were

10:50.520 --> 10:55.580
live Saturday not Sunday they happened I guess later Saturday night whatever who cares right

10:55.580 --> 11:00.920
it's just what some people claim to think is the best game of the year when that's an

11:00.920 --> 11:07.160
opinion left to the individual but I guess it created a stir that DJ Hero won best music

11:07.160 --> 11:13.660
game over the Rock Band Beatles I think one can admit they're both really good music games

11:13.660 --> 11:17.700
not to hate on Rock Band Beatles I think it's an amazing game but you know you did have

11:17.700 --> 11:28.480
an existing song list granted you know songs of a generation just huge songs in an existing

11:28.480 --> 11:34.720
engine whereas I think DJ Hero did something new and had some pretty awesome songs I mean

11:34.720 --> 11:39.200
I'm not hating on either game I just think DJ Hero is not as horrible as some of the

11:39.200 --> 11:42.200
haters are making it out to be all of a sudden I would have given it to DJ Hero too and I

11:42.200 --> 11:47.260
think a lot of people like following you in the negative press or whatever and they like

11:47.260 --> 11:52.600
to be right so you know they try to agree with the majority you know because they don't

11:52.600 --> 11:56.520
want to be challenged and stuff like that so that's a lot of it that's why you hear

11:56.520 --> 12:01.200
a lot of people echoing the same you know thoughts because if none of those stats were

12:01.200 --> 12:06.120
posted online or how the internet didn't exist you know these people probably wouldn't think

12:06.120 --> 12:11.480
too poorly upon the game well you know what I say haters to the left because you ain't

12:11.480 --> 12:18.200
right that's right you can quote me on that too that's really it otherwise I also oh one

12:18.200 --> 12:22.120
other quick thing steam's having a big sale this weekend and torchlight is half off and

12:22.120 --> 12:25.320
I played the demo which I talked about a few weeks ago on the show about three weeks ago

12:25.320 --> 12:30.320
or so and I I indulged and bought the full version of that game and I'm very excited

12:30.320 --> 12:36.320
to play that later when I get home so next week I'm sure I'll be talking about that anyhow

12:36.320 --> 12:40.280
that pretty much does it for our gaming weeks a little bit of housekeeping tonight we have

12:40.280 --> 12:43.840

have been spreading the word to friends and all that so thank you guys so much to everyone

13:07.320 --> 13:10.880
who's contributed to that and helping spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because

13:10.880 --> 13:16.920
you know we do do this show for free speaking of spreading the word how awesome is this

13:16.920 --> 13:23.200
the community myself Jamie Matt we have nothing to do with this honestly I mean we didn't

13:23.200 --> 13:28.000
we didn't help with this we didn't contribute to this but I'll be damned if we don't love

13:28.000 --> 13:33.840
this and support this and that is this olr revolution second mix I'm sure you guys are

13:33.840 --> 13:37.520
familiar this has been on the front of our site and I think it came up last week it's

13:37.520 --> 13:44.440
this DDR step mania skin that has an orange lounge radio theme to it and they've taken

13:44.440 --> 13:48.800
all these songs from the cage match segment if you've ever listened to the show live you

13:48.800 --> 13:53.080
know what that is or kind of inside jokes like I don't know if like the Daytona theme

13:53.080 --> 13:57.920
is in the game but it probably is you know things that are like jokes on this show and

13:57.920 --> 14:04.880
have put them into this yo DDR step mania thing and I guess John or DMN from understation

14:04.880 --> 14:07.720
live did all the announcer voices because you know when when orange launch radio was

14:07.720 --> 14:11.280
a station that show was on our station so you know that's certainly a part of the oil

14:11.280 --> 14:17.480
our family too it's just this whole thing that we didn't do it I wish I could be sitting

14:17.480 --> 14:21.960
here saying hey you should download this game because dark soccer Loki myself worked very

14:21.960 --> 14:26.600
hard on it and you know it's it's what we do but no no it's all the community and the

14:26.600 --> 14:33.960
people on our forums that did this and I'm gonna tell you right up don't expect a VGA

14:33.960 --> 14:38.320
award-winning type of game here I mean it is there's some very silly things in there

14:38.320 --> 14:43.440
I've seen some of the videos on the YouTube channel that they have I believe it's ol revolution

14:43.440 --> 14:49.040
some of the youtubes they have up I I have to admit I've been given an advance copy of

14:49.040 --> 14:51.300
the game but because I was out of town this weekend I didn't get a chance to check it

14:51.300 --> 14:55.200
out so sorry but I saw that I did watch the videos and just looking at some of the songs

14:55.200 --> 15:01.320
that are in it like I'm just I'm facepalming because like they found shit that I did live

15:01.320 --> 15:05.960
where I would sing along to songs because I was that bored and that's what was funny

15:05.960 --> 15:10.960
back in 2002 when we were first learning how to broadcast somebody saved that shit and

15:10.960 --> 15:17.400
is now in this game I mean how embarrassing karaoke I should I should old karaoke I should

15:17.400 --> 15:24.000
not be encouraged God if like a prayer showed up in there I'm gonna die Rob what is it Loki

15:24.000 --> 15:29.400
is like a prayer in there I think it is fuck I found the video for it fuck like seriously

15:29.400 --> 15:34.880
I should not be encouraging people to seek this out it's okay the time that you guys

15:34.880 --> 15:38.880
wanted to do you know the funny stuff again remember we tried to yeah give me the sinker

15:38.880 --> 15:44.960
okey again yeah so oops I did it again is in there as well so great so yeah we I'm

15:44.960 --> 15:48.900
sure we all have a little bit of embarrassment in there but okay whatever you know I can

15:48.900 --> 15:53.360
look past the silliness and the fact that you know what they're doing it cuz you know

15:53.360 --> 15:58.440
somebody thought it was cool as as dumb as it was and they made a game out of it I think

15:58.440 --> 16:06.360
it's awesome and it's such like as individuals who have been doing this for free for going

16:06.360 --> 16:10.500
on eight years now and not really seeing any money out of this in fact oftentimes losing

16:10.500 --> 16:15.080
a lot of money into this it's that that's like total reward right there so thank you

16:15.080 --> 16:18.640
guys so much to the community and everybody that put that together I understand it is

16:18.640 --> 16:26.200
coming out Christmas Eve so stay tuned 1224 of 09 to orange lounge radio.com I think they're

16:26.200 --> 16:29.400
putting the finishing touches on that right now so thank you so much to the community

16:29.400 --> 16:32.560
for putting that together we might get some phone calls of that later I know I gotta tell

16:32.560 --> 16:36.120
earlier in the show about one of the developers behind it is going to call in and tell us

16:36.120 --> 16:42.840
all about it and so we'll find out some more anyhow that's all I have for housekeeping

16:42.840 --> 16:50.160
sorta I want to get into the news tonight but first I want to talk about this because

16:50.160 --> 16:56.080
this didn't make the show world tonight because dark Sakura and Loki really kind of did things

16:56.080 --> 16:59.640
because I was out this weekend so I'm thanks to everybody for picking up the slack because

16:59.640 --> 17:04.120
I wasn't here but I saw something on the internet literally in the 15 minutes I was home between

17:04.120 --> 17:06.960
the time I got back from LA and the time I came over to do orange laundry tonight that

17:06.960 --> 17:11.040
pissed me off and so obviously didn't make the show world because because the others

17:11.040 --> 17:17.400
didn't know about it but I have to say something about it because I'm so angry at this that

17:17.400 --> 17:22.480
I have to say something about it and it has to do with something I actually saw on Kotaku

17:22.480 --> 17:26.040
but it's not Kotaku I'm mad at in fact I think they're great there's lots of great video

17:26.040 --> 17:29.240
game blogs out there that I check regularly as I'm sure most of you do and Kotaku is one

17:29.240 --> 17:33.940
of them and when I was home for a few minutes I checked the site in my reader and saw that

17:33.940 --> 17:40.400
they had just run a story about out magazines gayest games ever list or I think the actual

17:40.400 --> 17:45.300
name of the list is the gayest video games that they put together this list that is running

17:45.300 --> 17:52.920
on out magazine very little journalistic contents content to this nobody signed the article

17:52.920 --> 17:57.460
so I don't know who did it but and if you read it you can pretty much figure out why

17:57.460 --> 18:05.080
I really shouldn't be encouraging you to seek this out because this list is not only stupid

18:05.080 --> 18:12.040
but it's so stupid it's offensive I am offended by this article you want to know why listen

18:12.040 --> 18:17.360
to such gem excerpts such as this the gayest video games obviously I can't read the entire

18:17.360 --> 18:23.000
article but it's because it's copyright but for you know purposes of criticism I can cite

18:23.000 --> 18:28.400
certain pieces of it Super Mario Brothers makes the list which they put a video of Super

18:28.400 --> 18:38.720
Mario Brothers 3 but they describe Super Mario Brothers cleaning pipes and taking names get

18:38.720 --> 18:47.520
it because like cleaning pipes is like a euphemism for gay sex that's so funny let's see moving

18:47.520 --> 18:53.680
on with this Contra two bare-chested dudes on a mission neither can accomplish without

18:53.680 --> 18:58.800
the other widely thought to have influenced any products before she penned the short story

18:58.800 --> 19:12.560
to Brokeback Mountain so you don't have to play the game with two people and anyone that

19:12.560 --> 19:18.840
has spent enough time with this game kind of knows that right yeah let's see what else

19:18.840 --> 19:25.080
oh here was my favorite this is the last one I'm gonna read here burger time the yeah burger

19:25.080 --> 19:32.000
time is apparently a gay video game the slap some meat between those buns tagline was jettisoned

19:32.000 --> 19:38.900
for the less memorable let's get cooking but this 1982 arcade title was created as a witty

19:38.900 --> 19:45.760
and fun commentary on the closeted state of male-to-male sexuality in the early 1980s no

19:45.760 --> 19:56.080
it wasn't it's about a fucking hamburger really really you are a gay magazine and you are

19:56.080 --> 20:02.460
reinforcing these stereotypes that we have all come to hate and despise and try to fight

20:02.460 --> 20:08.760
against in the wake of things like proposition 8 in California and proposition 1 in Maine

20:08.760 --> 20:13.620
and I'm sorry I'm getting loud to those in studio but that's how mad I get like the this

20:13.620 --> 20:20.360
mentality sets back what we've tried to accomplish by going back to these schoolyard tactics

20:20.360 --> 20:26.300
of well if X&Y is true then teehee you must be gay because so-and-so talks with the lisp

20:26.300 --> 20:31.180
you're a faggot do you know how many times I had to hear that growing up and what you're

20:31.180 --> 20:35.880
doing in this magazine article is that any better because they're bare-chested dudes

20:35.880 --> 20:42.560
going on an adventure together this makes this a gay video game I'm sorry I find that

20:42.560 --> 20:49.040
to be offensive nowhere here in this article does it talk about Dragon Age a game where

20:49.040 --> 20:54.060
you can have a same gender relationship if you want or not your choice or how about what

20:54.060 --> 20:58.100
I consider to be one of the most landmark games for homosexual content ever made The

20:58.100 --> 21:05.200
Sims yeah if you want to have a gay relationship go for it if you don't don't what you do in

21:05.200 --> 21:12.000
your walls is your choice does that game come up in this article no because to some junior

21:12.000 --> 21:17.400
high school graduate here it's apparently not funny but putting a list of games in a

21:17.400 --> 21:23.760
blender that are apparently popular and finding deal it's like it's like a four-year-old trying

21:23.760 --> 21:27.800
to force and I said this is part of my comment which by the way funny funny hasn't posted

21:27.800 --> 21:31.560
yet because it has to screen for editorial so watch this content won't appear but as

21:31.560 --> 21:35.820
I said in the comment it's like trying to watch a four-year-old jam a square peg into

21:35.820 --> 21:39.760
a round hole you're creating a list of reasons why they're gay you know it's like when you

21:39.760 --> 21:47.120
read these piss me off to when these gay rags do this they post a list of oh well Jake Gyllenhaal

21:47.120 --> 21:53.960
must be gay because he bottomed for Heath Ledger or he looks good without a shirt off

21:53.960 --> 22:01.200
you know or whatever reason they pick up how is that any better from what you faced as

22:01.200 --> 22:06.000
a homosexual man or a bisexual man or somebody in the minority your entire life how is what

22:06.000 --> 22:12.020
you're saying any better than that because you do one thing you must be gay this list

22:12.020 --> 22:17.780
is stupid this list is has nothing to do with gay people it has nothing to do with video

22:17.780 --> 22:23.800
games it's insulting and I denounce it and if you are a gay man listening to this show

22:23.800 --> 22:26.880
which I've been blessed amongst the seven or eight years to meet many gay people that

22:26.880 --> 22:31.480
listen to the show and have said many nice things about you know what we do here and

22:31.480 --> 22:36.560
all that stuff you should be fucking pissed to hit you are a straight man who plays video

22:36.560 --> 22:40.000
games you should be fucking pissed at this because they don't know what the hell they're

22:40.000 --> 22:44.760
talking about an out magazine if you want to write about video games and hire someone

22:44.760 --> 22:48.880
who knows what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to video games and has the balls

22:48.880 --> 22:52.800
to sign their articles and has the balls to sign their article and has and is going to

22:52.800 --> 23:01.240
sign a check that they're asking cash no pun intended it's just ridiculous I mean my

23:01.240 --> 23:05.240
Oh my God, if Joe and Niki had been on the list, at least I could see that.

23:05.240 --> 23:08.240
I mean, I would think that's a little stupid, but come on.

23:08.240 --> 23:11.240
Jamie, Loki, am I crazy? Do I have a point?

23:11.240 --> 23:15.240
No, you're not crazy. Is that magazine, though, just for men, specifically?

23:15.240 --> 23:19.240
Out Magazine? I don't know. I don't subscribe. I hear it's been around forever.

23:19.240 --> 23:23.240
But clearly you can understand why I'm not going to subscribe to these types of magazines.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.240
As a woman, I'm actually kind of offended by that, too.

23:26.240 --> 23:35.240
I believe Out is specifically targeted at gay men, but I'm sure they're not going to say no to a lesbian who wants to buy it.

23:35.240 --> 23:44.240
I just think that that's completely baffling and silly that they could even pass something like that and think that it would be actually funny.

23:44.240 --> 23:53.240
I mean, if the whole list is strictly for parody, it should say parody, and then maybe. It might be remotely funny.

23:53.240 --> 24:01.240
It still would be about as funny as World War II. It's not funny.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.240
I'm trying to play devil's advocate.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.240
I understand.

24:04.240 --> 24:09.240
That would be the only thing that I could remotely see something like that maybe passing to be posted.

24:09.240 --> 24:17.240
Oh, no, this is satire. This is parody. This is us making fun of other people by sort of the Colbert action, you know what I mean?

24:17.240 --> 24:21.240
How he makes fun of Republicans by acting like an uber-Republican.

24:21.240 --> 24:26.240
But other than that, if there's no type of disclaimer about that, then no.

24:26.240 --> 24:31.240
In fact, actually, I would say don't just post a comment on there.

24:31.240 --> 24:35.240
Actually get their address and mail something in.

24:35.240 --> 24:41.240
I'm curious to see. Just for sake, real quick, I know we're pushed for time tonight, but I just want to read what I said on the article.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.240
Because you may not see this.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.240
Yeah.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.240
If you see this, then they let it run.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.240
We'll post it up on our forums, too.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.240
Here's the comment I made.

24:48.240 --> 24:54.240
As a gay man and a long-time gaming enthusiast, I find this meat compilation to be not only horribly misinformed but offensive.

24:54.240 --> 24:58.240
Nowhere on this list are games mentioned that actually meant anything to gay representation in games.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.240
Love who you want to love in The Sims.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.240
Choose to have a same-gender night of passion in Dragon Age.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.240
Or not.

25:03.240 --> 25:10.240
Not even a frickin' bone tossed at controversial gay content in games such as the hidden kiss in Bully or the lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect.

25:10.240 --> 25:17.240
This article looks like an extremely casual gamer took a list of games that they actually remembered playing as a child, threw them in a blender,

25:17.240 --> 25:21.240
and like a four-year-old trying to put a square peg in a round hole, invented a reason why the game is gay.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.240
It's the equivalent of saying if X is true, well, then it must be gay.

25:24.240 --> 25:28.240
Such as if so-and-so talks with a lisp and has a six-pack, well, they must be gay.

25:28.240 --> 25:33.240
No one likes a stereotype, so why a magazine like this would sink to such a juvenile level is ridiculous.

25:33.240 --> 25:37.240
Shame on you for the space-filling, attention-grabbing, immature piece of garbage.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.240
Because that's what it is. It is garbage.

25:39.240 --> 25:43.240
And I'm mad because I'm so disappointed.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.240
I am so disappointed.

25:45.240 --> 25:52.240
I'm sure whoever wrote this article, assuming they're gay, hell, assuming they're straight working in a gay magazine,

25:52.240 --> 25:56.240
at some point in their life has had a stereotype passed on to them.

25:56.240 --> 26:01.240
And to just turn around and post this crap in the face of that is disappointing.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.240
It's so disappointing that I'm angry.

26:03.240 --> 26:08.240
Out, do the right thing, and renounce this article and apologize.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.240
I demand it.

26:10.240 --> 26:16.240
And if you demand it too, which you should, out.com.

26:16.240 --> 26:18.240
And I don't know. I could read the whole-

26:18.240 --> 26:20.240
Call for a boycott until we do.

26:20.240 --> 26:24.240
Just go to the website and tell someone you're pissed, because I know I'm pissed.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.240
Anyhow.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.240
Maybe I will send us a letter to the editor. I don't know.

26:29.240 --> 26:32.240
Black Wolf says in chat I would send us a letter to the editor.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.240
Maybe I should. I don't know.

26:34.240 --> 26:36.240
We'll see what happens tomorrow.

26:36.240 --> 26:41.240
Remember, remember. I think whether or not it's posted, you should still send it to the editor.

26:41.240 --> 26:51.240
Because keep in mind, what's one of the big things that I personally believe by is that if you don't bring something to the attention of someone who can do something about it, then it's just going to keep going on.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.240
Okay, fair enough. Here's what I'll do.

26:53.240 --> 26:59.240
I will write a letter to the editor if all of you who are just as pissed off as I am will write a letter to the editor too.

26:59.240 --> 27:02.240
I still think you should write it despite everything, but I mean, I'll write one.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.240
I'm trying to encourage everyone.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.240
No, everyone. I'll write one.

27:06.240 --> 27:10.240
Great. Great. Then we have a cause.

27:10.240 --> 27:13.240
This is a much more important cause than President Cat, might I add.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.240
But President Cat's pretty damn important.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.240
President Cat is pretty damn awesome.

27:18.240 --> 27:23.240
Honestly, I want to say this again, because I know not everybody who listens to this show is gay. Duh.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.240
I know we have tons of straight guys, straight gals that listen to this program.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.240
Honestly, if you're a straight guy, this list should piss you off too.

27:29.240 --> 27:33.240
Straight guys. I know there's some that listen. Straight guys that do musical theater.

27:33.240 --> 27:38.240
How many times have you been called gay just because you do musical theater and you like music and you like all that stuff?

27:38.240 --> 27:43.240
Honestly, if you think about what's going on here, it's the same thing.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.240
Yeah.

27:44.240 --> 27:49.240
And you should be offended. You might be more pissed off than I am, honestly.

27:49.240 --> 27:53.240
Contra being an inspiration for Brokeback Mountain, please.

27:53.240 --> 27:57.240
The book was written?

27:57.240 --> 28:01.240
I think the book was probably written before that game ever came out. I'm not sure.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.240
I'll have to find out. But yeah, it's just ridiculous.

28:04.240 --> 28:07.240
Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.

28:07.240 --> 28:13.240
I mean, I was in band and I played softball for a little while.

28:13.240 --> 28:17.240
Question in the chat room. What about bisexuals or pansexuals or asexuals?

28:17.240 --> 28:22.240
Anyone who hates stereotypes should be offended by this article.

28:22.240 --> 28:28.240
So if you hate bisexual stereotypes, you know, like bisexual or just bisexual because they're sluts.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.240
That's a stereotype.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.240
No, no, no. This is what I get.

28:31.240 --> 28:36.240
Or asexuals or asexual because they can't get any. That's a stereotype. Just like these.

28:36.240 --> 28:42.240
This is the stuff that I get. I'm married, but I've had girlfriends in the past.

28:42.240 --> 28:48.240
And it's just like, oh, well, you're married now, so you're not. It doesn't change.

28:48.240 --> 28:52.240
It just means I found someone I fell in love with. It doesn't change anything.

28:52.240 --> 28:56.240
So I'm totally pissed off by that.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.240
Just do whatever.

28:58.240 --> 29:05.240
I hate stereotypes. I may bring up a stereotype just to make fun of the fact that it exists.

29:05.240 --> 29:11.240
Because I think that if you can't laugh at something, then you're taking life too seriously.

29:11.240 --> 29:15.240
I laugh at the lack of intelligence on that part of these people.

29:15.240 --> 29:18.240
I laugh because it's sad and pathetic.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.240
But there is a time when things do go too far, I think.

29:22.240 --> 29:28.240
Especially from a, quote, trusted resource.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.240
Just honestly, honestly, and I'll leave it with this.

29:30.240 --> 29:34.240
And I know Loki's sitting over there very quiet, probably waiting to get into gaming news.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.240
But let me say this.

29:35.240 --> 29:39.240
Honestly, just do whatever the fuck you want to do.

29:39.240 --> 29:43.240
Kids, go do whatever the fuck you want to do.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.240
Except camels.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.240
Just as long as you don't hurt other people.

29:47.240 --> 29:52.240
And this article hurts.

29:52.240 --> 29:55.240
Right, Loki?

29:55.240 --> 29:56.240
Sure.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.240
Alright.

29:57.240 --> 29:58.240
He has meat.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.240
No, I was going to let you do gaming news.

30:00.240 --> 30:04.240
No, it's fine. I didn't really have anything to contribute.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.240
Am I right? It's stupid.

30:06.240 --> 30:11.240
I saw the article when I was looking for stories.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.240
I was like, eh, no list.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.240
Skip right past it.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.240
And that's pretty much, you know...

30:17.240 --> 30:20.240
So you had the journalistic integrity to go, this is stupid, skip. Right?

30:20.240 --> 30:22.240
I didn't even have to read the list. I just saw the list.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.240
No, gay is video games.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.240
That's dumb. Okay, next.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.240
Well, I clicked it because I was...

30:27.240 --> 30:32.240
Honestly, my curiosity was, oh, I wonder if Dragon Age got really high because it's a new game.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.240
Because I'm thinking, oh, this is going to be like a...

30:34.240 --> 30:37.240
And then when I read it, I was like, my jaw hit the floor.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.240
I was like, I can't believe...

30:38.240 --> 30:41.240
Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to spend 20 minutes of the show ranting about it.

30:41.240 --> 30:45.240
We can talk about real gaming news now. Real gaming news, folks. Real gaming news.

30:45.240 --> 30:52.240
Anyways, let's start things off with Out Magazine's top gay games list.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.240
Oh, wait, no.

30:53.240 --> 30:58.240
So yes, as rumored and as we've been talking about before,

30:58.240 --> 31:07.240
the water expansion for LittleBigPlanet is going to be hitting the PlayStation Network before Christmas.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.240
And it is coming out this week.

31:09.240 --> 31:13.240
And to kind of tie with it, and I'm surprised I didn't think of it before,

31:13.240 --> 31:16.240
you'll be getting the Pirates of the Caribbean content.

31:16.240 --> 31:22.240
Yes, much like they did with the Metal Gear Solid pack in introducing the Painator,

31:22.240 --> 31:26.240
the water pack will be coming with a Pirates of the Caribbean level pack

31:26.240 --> 31:30.240
to kind of introduce all the elements that are with the water.

31:30.240 --> 31:34.240
And those will be out on the PlayStation Network on the 22nd.

31:34.240 --> 31:39.240
And including with that will be a six-pack of Pirates costumes including Jack Sparrow,

31:39.240 --> 31:45.240
Davy Jones, Will Turner, and some of the other characters in the actual movie.

31:45.240 --> 31:49.240
And also you can get a free cannibal costume as well if you don't want to buy any of that stuff.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.240
At the very least you get a free cannibal costume.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.240
And I can't wait to buy this.

31:54.240 --> 31:59.240
I'm so glad after such a sad, angry news item that we have something that makes me happy again.

31:59.240 --> 32:03.240
And this makes me happy that LittleBigPlanet is still getting some love all this time later.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.240
And I know this has been sprinkled throughout the past few shows.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.240
Isn't it weird that this game is a year old

32:07.240 --> 32:10.240
and I seriously think LittleBigPlanet has come up every show for like the past month

32:10.240 --> 32:14.240
leading up to this, the release of this pack, and I think it's going to be awesome.

32:14.240 --> 32:18.240
I'm excited to see how water is going to change the game, especially in the fan levels.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.240
I mean, don't get me wrong, the Pirates levels are probably going to be awesome

32:21.240 --> 32:25.240
because the Metal Gear Solid levels, that was some of the best bargain DLC.

32:25.240 --> 32:29.240
It was almost like playing a new game for seven, eight bucks.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.240
I'm excited to see what this is going to bring.

32:31.240 --> 32:35.240
Definitely. And it's going to be five pirate themed levels.

32:35.240 --> 32:40.240
They're going to have four new audio tracks in there, new backgrounds, and that kind of stuff.

32:40.240 --> 32:47.240
And I just can't wait to play it. Seriously, this week is going to be awesome.

32:47.240 --> 32:55.240
To kind of go with that, real quick, a little bit LittleBigPlanet related, but not.

32:55.240 --> 33:03.240
There was an advertisement for LittleBigPlanet accessories for the PSP, and this is straight from Sony.

33:03.240 --> 33:11.240
Funny thing about that is, that advertisement lists the PSP 4000 on top of the PSP Go.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.240
Huh.

33:13.240 --> 33:22.240
So perhaps they're going to have another reiteration of the PSP coming out.

33:22.240 --> 33:27.240
Even though the Go is where it's at now, right?

33:27.240 --> 33:31.240
Even though it's still listed on there, but it's actually separate from the PSP Go.

33:31.240 --> 33:41.240
It's the PSP 4000. And I remember back a while ago, they had some graphics for the PSP 4000 as well, a little icon for it, months ago.

33:41.240 --> 33:50.240
So, much like other Sony rumors, I'm going to say that probably we're going to hear about the PSP 4000 within the next few months.

33:50.240 --> 33:57.240
That's really surprising to me, because I would think with the Go, as much of a hard time as we've given it on this program,

33:57.240 --> 34:00.240
you'd think that if the company really believes in it, they're going to put all their might behind it.

34:00.240 --> 34:07.240
But to kind of come out and say, oh well, we're going to go back to the old design and the 4000, which implies by nature that it's like the 3000,

34:07.240 --> 34:13.240
but with some changes, just like all the other iterations before it, that they're going to go away.

34:13.240 --> 34:16.240
In other words, this sounds like it's going to be a UMD-enabled machine.

34:16.240 --> 34:25.240
Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if it's just something simple like adding onboard storage, because that doesn't take up that much space,

34:25.240 --> 34:37.240
and why they couldn't do that in the first place. Or someone was theorizing that they may go the route where they're going to include a camera built in to compete with the DSI,

34:37.240 --> 34:41.240
so that you can use the camera support, since it does support the camera.

34:41.240 --> 34:48.240
They just never have released a camera over here for the PSP, even though it's built into our firmware.

34:48.240 --> 34:53.240
I'm reading some comments from chat room. First, I want to say this about the water piece of LittleBigPlanet.

34:53.240 --> 34:58.240
Ionotropic said, whoops, where was it? I just saw it. It was something about the water. There it is.

34:58.240 --> 35:02.240
Water levels always suck. Do not want. You know what, though?

35:02.240 --> 35:05.240
But think about what the water is going to do in the user-created levels.

35:05.240 --> 35:10.240
That's what's most exciting. I mean, because water means free movement anywhere, right?

35:10.240 --> 35:15.240
No jumping, whatever. It's free movement. That could be very interesting for some of the user-created things.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.240
Yeah. I think. We'll see, though.

35:18.240 --> 35:25.240
ToaGak says in our chat room at chat.orensonsradio.com, 4,000? Are they going to remove features again?

35:25.240 --> 35:30.240
Even the 3,000 lost a feature, the infrared port. Then the Go lost the UMD, so what's this going to lose?

35:30.240 --> 35:34.240
Well, the infrared port, I can understand, because they didn't use it for anything.

35:34.240 --> 35:40.240
I mean, other than Homebrew, which enabled use of it, but it didn't really use it for anything.

35:40.240 --> 35:43.240
I mean, they were going to possibly use it for a keyboard or something, but it never did.

35:43.240 --> 35:48.240
I know what the PSP 4,000 will do. It's going to finally stop piracy for good.

35:48.240 --> 35:52.240
No, wait. For real this time, guys. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. For real.

35:52.240 --> 35:56.240
We're going to stop piracy and Homebrew on the PSP for good. That's what the 4,000 is all about.

35:56.240 --> 36:03.240
That's awesome that you're going to do that, except that there's all these other versions of the PSP out there that people can still pirate on.

36:03.240 --> 36:08.240
Why would they buy a new system that's not going to be able to do what they want to do?

36:08.240 --> 36:18.240
It'd be the equivalent of them making new currency that has all these counterfeiting preventive measures built into it.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.240
But we're going to accept the old currency, too.

36:20.240 --> 36:25.240
Then why would you try to counterfeit the new currency? You're just going to counterfeit the old one. It's stupid.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.240
I like this comment in our chat room. Joshi16 says,

36:27.240 --> 36:33.240
When will the PSP become over 9,000? That's a fair question.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.240
Maybe another five years.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.240
That's a fair question.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.240
All right. Well, moving on to other Sony news.

36:38.240 --> 36:48.240
There's a report out there that apparently there's a survey from an online research company that has been sent out that apparently is looking at interest in a premium subscription to PSN.

36:48.240 --> 36:54.240
Sony's kind of thinking about if they ask for membership fees, they could do some extra goodies and so forth.

36:54.240 --> 37:05.240
For example, hour-long trials for full PS3 titles, access to PS1 classics and cross-game voice chat, which apparently is still not...

37:05.240 --> 37:10.240
I always thought that was kind of there in PS3 games, but apparently it is still not there.

37:10.240 --> 37:16.240
Let's see. Also something called cloud storage, which is similar to what we have with Steam Cloud,

37:16.240 --> 37:22.240
which basically could be an online space where you could store saved data and then you could pull your saved games from this cloud.

37:22.240 --> 37:26.240
So this is very good for when you're going over to friends' houses and so forth.

37:26.240 --> 37:36.240
The survey also drops hints that they're thinking about things like streaming Netflix without a disk, Hulu support, free access to minis, premium things and so forth.

37:36.240 --> 37:40.240
Now, I would not read too much into these types of surveys.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.240
Surveys are surveys.

37:41.240 --> 37:47.240
They're gauging interest and they're going to throw all sorts of possibilities out there that might not have been thought up by Sony.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.240
They might have been thought up by the marketing company.

37:49.240 --> 37:55.240
I mean, it's that old corporate mentality of let's throw things against the wall and see what sticks.

37:55.240 --> 38:00.240
So, I mean, it's not to say that nothing here is ever going to come true.

38:00.240 --> 38:06.240
Someone with power is thinking about it, but I don't think there's need to flail and panic just yet.

38:06.240 --> 38:10.240
Loki? Dark Sakura? What do you think? Agree? Disagree?

38:10.240 --> 38:15.240
Some of it will probably come true because all the Sony rumors seem to come true sooner or later.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.240
They have lasers getting leaked.

38:17.240 --> 38:24.240
I think in some ways, if you think about it, Sony is already doing a pay for membership system.

38:24.240 --> 38:27.240
Hello? They already have their core magazine.

38:27.240 --> 38:33.240
That magazine unlocks special demos such as the Mod Nation Racers Beta.

38:33.240 --> 38:36.240
It does all these special things and special access.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.240
Don't you think Sony kind of already has it?

38:39.240 --> 38:41.240
They're just not calling it what Xbox calls it?

38:41.240 --> 38:42.240
Yeah.

38:42.240 --> 38:47.240
I mean, that's kind of my thought on it is that all these things they're talking about,

38:47.240 --> 38:50.240
things that could possibly get expanded to core.

38:50.240 --> 38:54.240
Although, I don't know, when you talk about such core features, no pun intended,

38:54.240 --> 38:59.240
like cross-game voice chat, that is a little like, wow, they would really charge for that.

38:59.240 --> 39:03.240
I mean, you get that free on the Xbox, don't you at least?

39:03.240 --> 39:08.240
I mean, I know you can't play games, but I guess then at the same time,

39:08.240 --> 39:11.240
you can play games for free on Sony's network and you can't do that on Xbox.

39:11.240 --> 39:14.240
So what might be considered a core feature one system might not be for another.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.240
I don't know.

39:15.240 --> 39:24.240
But I think a lot of the problems with the Sony system is that they don't have their own network.

39:24.240 --> 39:28.240
Well, I mean, they have their own network, but they don't have their dedicated servers basically.

39:28.240 --> 39:32.240
It's just all, you know, each company has their own servers for PlayStation games

39:32.240 --> 39:36.240
since everything on Xbox Live is basically on the Microsoft servers.

39:36.240 --> 39:42.240
Cross chat, cross servers is going to be tough because, you know,

39:42.240 --> 39:44.240
it's all these different servers you have to go through.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.240
I mean, I don't know.

39:46.240 --> 39:49.240
I guess they could do it if they really wanted to.

39:49.240 --> 39:52.240
Let's go to the chat room for some other comments on the story.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.240
GameGuru in our chat room says,

39:53.240 --> 39:58.240
Doesn't Sony realize that their free service is the only advantage PSN has over Xbox Live?

39:58.240 --> 40:01.240
DJ Tyrant says, I really enjoy core to be honest.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.240
I heart Veronica Belmont.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.240
There are a lot of core fans out there.

40:05.240 --> 40:11.240
I mean, I personally don't subscribe, but I don't think it's a stupid idea.

40:11.240 --> 40:16.240
I think it's actually a pretty decent one for the folks that want to, you know, pay the money to have it.

40:16.240 --> 40:21.240
You know, a lot of folks used, I mean, it's just the modern equivalent of buying the magazine

40:21.240 --> 40:23.240
that came with the demo discs, and you were paying for those.

40:23.240 --> 40:27.240
So, it's kind of the modern equivalent of that, honestly.

40:27.240 --> 40:31.240
So, anyhow, if you have other thoughts on that, of course, our mailbag is always open.

40:31.240 --> 40:35.240
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, but for now, some more gaming news.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.240
Yes, DarkSagra?

40:36.240 --> 40:40.240
Yes, we have some news regarding SingStar.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.240
My favorite.

40:41.240 --> 40:44.240
Well, of course, I gave you ABBA.

40:44.240 --> 40:50.240
There's a SingStar viewer application to be released, well, it doesn't have a date yet,

40:50.240 --> 40:57.240
but to be coming out for PS3 that has a different social networking.

40:57.240 --> 41:02.240
You can do different things with the players.

41:02.240 --> 41:07.240
It's actually called SingStar Viewer, like I said, which would be in your games folder.

41:07.240 --> 41:10.240
You can browse and purchase songs from the SingStar.

41:10.240 --> 41:16.240
You can vote on videos and photos and rate stuff, and it's supposed to be free.

41:16.240 --> 41:22.240
And you also should be able to use it even when you do not have the SingStar disc in the system.

41:22.240 --> 41:29.240
And again, not a date yet on it, but it says that it should be in the coming weeks.

41:29.240 --> 41:33.240
Well, that's kind of neat, but that was also, like, for me, kind of a selling point of SingStar,

41:33.240 --> 41:35.240
was that, you know, you had access to this.

41:35.240 --> 41:38.240
Because I don't know if you've ever gone on, for those that own SingStar on the PS3,

41:38.240 --> 41:40.240
if you've ever gone on there and really, and you can have any of them,

41:40.240 --> 41:43.240
Volume 1, Volume 2, ABBA Queen, doesn't matter which one you have,

41:43.240 --> 41:46.240
go on to there and look at some of the YouTubes people do.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.240
There's actually some pretty funny stuff on there.

41:49.240 --> 41:53.240
A lot of times the stuff that's high-rated is, like, people's kids.

41:53.240 --> 41:57.240
A lot of, like, you know, four-year-old child prodigies that sing get highly ranked.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.240
But, like, there's just some really funny stuff there.

41:59.240 --> 42:03.240
Like, the guy who dresses up in the Stormtrooper outfit to dance to I Don't Feel Like Dancing.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.240
Like, just dumb stuff.

42:05.240 --> 42:08.240
But it's the same type of dumb stuff we watch on YouTube.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.240
Yeah.

42:10.240 --> 42:14.240
So I guess extra publicity for the game is never a bad thing, right?

42:14.240 --> 42:17.240
Everyone gets their five minutes of fame?

42:17.240 --> 42:20.240
Yeah, I guess, you know, and it's also kind of one of those things where

42:20.240 --> 42:23.240
I think that's where it ultimately might help drive sales,

42:23.240 --> 42:25.240
is that people download this and go,

42:25.240 --> 42:28.240
oh, this is really funny, but I can do better.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.240
My nephew can sing better than this kid,

42:30.240 --> 42:32.240
or I got an outfit that outdo's this one,

42:32.240 --> 42:35.240
so they're going to go buy the game so they can get it on the SingStar channel.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.240
It's interesting.

42:37.240 --> 42:41.240
It's certainly a selling point of the game that Lips doesn't have,

42:41.240 --> 42:43.240
or Karaoke Revolution doesn't have,

42:43.240 --> 42:45.240
or hell, even Rock Band doesn't have this.

42:45.240 --> 42:47.240
You can't save your performances from Rock Band.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.240
Could you imagine, and, oh, God,

42:49.240 --> 42:52.240
maybe this is something they're going to cook up for Rock Band 3.

42:52.240 --> 42:54.240
Oh, wow, I think I might be on to something, can't you?

42:54.240 --> 42:57.240
Especially in this whole thing that we're getting into,

42:57.240 --> 43:01.240
can you imagine if Rock Band 3 had this type of,

43:01.240 --> 43:03.240
I think that might be it.

43:03.240 --> 43:04.240
I bet that's where they're going to go with this.

43:04.240 --> 43:07.240
Some type of share your performance on the internet type thing?

43:07.240 --> 43:08.240
Probably.

43:08.240 --> 43:09.240
I mean, if they're-

43:09.240 --> 43:10.240
SingStar Idol?

43:10.240 --> 43:12.240
They're doing it the other way right now, aren't they?

43:12.240 --> 43:17.240
Where if you're a band, put your song in Rock Band for the masses to consume.

43:17.240 --> 43:20.240
Oh, man, I bet that's what's coming in Rock Band 3.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.240
Share your performance with the internet.

43:22.240 --> 43:24.240
Watch. Watch.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.240
Because right now, SingStar's got the leg up on it,

43:28.240 --> 43:31.240
but I wonder, if this thing is successful,

43:31.240 --> 43:34.240
only a matter of time before the other music games notice.

43:36.240 --> 43:39.240
Loki, if there was a Rock Band 3 with internet connectivity,

43:39.240 --> 43:42.240
would you consider uploading some of your epic performances to it?

43:42.240 --> 43:44.240
I don't really play it that much, sadly.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.240
Really?

43:45.240 --> 43:46.240
Yeah.

43:46.240 --> 43:49.240
Oh my gosh, I would love to see you doing the Timmy song.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.240
Lords of the Underworld.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.240
Maybe.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.240
Alright.

43:56.240 --> 44:02.240
Well, another thing that you can kind of share in would be the new Sodium 1,

44:02.240 --> 44:05.240
which is kind of an MMO, I guess, on home.

44:05.240 --> 44:08.240
I don't know, I apparently ignored the whole MMO part of it

44:08.240 --> 44:11.240
because I actually checked it out a little bit.

44:11.240 --> 44:14.240
It's a self-contained social MMO, they're calling it,

44:14.240 --> 44:16.240
within PlayStation Home,

44:16.240 --> 44:22.240
and you kind of go through this teleporter that's in the central plaza,

44:22.240 --> 44:26.240
and you go in there and talk to this AI chick called Vicky,

44:26.240 --> 44:30.240
and she gives you different minigames and whatnot that you can play,

44:30.240 --> 44:34.240
including some different objective-based metagames,

44:34.240 --> 44:39.240
and I also have a full arcade-style game to play as well called the Assault Shooter,

44:39.240 --> 44:42.240
which I thought was kind of fun,

44:42.240 --> 44:45.240
but I think, as you were saying, it's a little bit like Battlezone, I think,

44:45.240 --> 44:47.240
the old Atari game.

44:47.240 --> 44:52.240
I feel like I've played a game like it on the PC back when I had a 386,

44:52.240 --> 44:54.240
and I don't remember what the game was,

44:54.240 --> 44:58.240
but it was one of those things that you would call up on the modem and play.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.240
Oh man, I distinctly remember the game.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.240
It was very popular, too.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.240
There were graphics like Battlezone, but it was this whole type of thing

45:04.240 --> 45:07.240
where you were out in the field and you would shoot tanks.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.240
I want to say I've played this game before, you know?

45:10.240 --> 45:14.240
And then, of course, you get different unlocks for leveling up in the game.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.240
Apparently, the Assault Shooter game that's in there,

45:16.240 --> 45:19.240
only five levels are available in the game for free,

45:19.240 --> 45:22.240
and you have to buy more.

45:22.240 --> 45:27.240
I guess more levels and items are unlockable through microtransactions.

45:27.240 --> 45:29.240
Yeah, I think I would have played it up to about level five.

45:29.240 --> 45:32.240
I played it only through level three before I got tired of doing it

45:32.240 --> 45:36.240
because I was working on some other stuff.

45:36.240 --> 45:41.240
But if I had to pay for more levels than that, I don't think I'm going to.

45:41.240 --> 45:45.240
But to me, though, this game didn't seem any different

45:45.240 --> 45:47.240
than the other ones already available in the home,

45:47.240 --> 45:51.240
and I just miss the whole MMO part of it

45:51.240 --> 45:54.240
and how this is even really that innovative.

45:54.240 --> 45:56.240
Well, I don't know if I would call it an MMO

45:56.240 --> 45:59.240
because at least the shooting part of it, that's not multiplayer.

45:59.240 --> 46:00.240
No.

46:00.240 --> 46:04.240
Now, the drink-making game, that was kind of multiplayer.

46:04.240 --> 46:07.240
If you play as the bartender, someone else is calling the drinks,

46:07.240 --> 46:10.240
and if you're ordering the drinks, someone else has to play the bartender.

46:10.240 --> 46:13.240
There's, I guess, that, but that's a bit of a stretch.

46:13.240 --> 46:15.240
I don't know if I'd call it an MMO.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.240
But what I thought was interesting about this

46:17.240 --> 46:20.240
is the way it kind of fit into the context of home.

46:20.240 --> 46:22.240
And it kind of showed off these features of home

46:22.240 --> 46:24.240
that I didn't realize were there,

46:24.240 --> 46:27.240
such as the ability to interact with what's on the web.

46:27.240 --> 46:30.240
If you go to the website, sodium1.com, I think it is,

46:30.240 --> 46:32.240
and you actually put in your PlayStation ID and all this stuff,

46:32.240 --> 46:34.240
it tracks your mini achievements.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.240
I mean, they're not actual trophies,

46:36.240 --> 46:38.240
but they're like achievements within sodium.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.240
It tracks them on the website.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.240
It tracks your high scores.

46:41.240 --> 46:43.240
There's a Facebook app that you can use,

46:43.240 --> 46:44.240
and, of course, it's just going to...

46:44.240 --> 46:47.240
I enabled it, but I didn't enable it to publish it on my wall

46:47.240 --> 46:49.240
because I knew every time I did something in the game,

46:49.240 --> 46:50.240
all my friends would have to see it,

46:50.240 --> 46:53.240
and I didn't want to burden people with that.

46:53.240 --> 46:55.240
But, you know, it does have that connectivity.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.240
I thought it was interesting that there's a giant screen

46:57.240 --> 47:00.240
within the sodium stadium, or whatever they call it,

47:00.240 --> 47:02.240
that has their Twitter feed on it.

47:02.240 --> 47:04.240
I don't recall seeing that in home before.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.240
Yeah, that'd be nice to have in my clubhouse, too.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.240
Right?

47:07.240 --> 47:13.240
If that's doable, can I have that in the OLR clubhouse, please?

47:13.240 --> 47:15.240
I also thought it was interesting that you could,

47:15.240 --> 47:18.240
you know, the points that you earn in the game

47:18.240 --> 47:21.240
could go towards unlocking stuff in the home

47:21.240 --> 47:24.240
that you could put, like, if you go to the OLR clubhouse now,

47:24.240 --> 47:26.240
there's a new table, there's some new seats,

47:26.240 --> 47:27.240
and a new little statue.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.240
I got all that in the sodium one thing.

47:29.240 --> 47:31.240
So, you know, I'm not saying that's really new,

47:31.240 --> 47:33.240
because certainly there's a lot of other, you know,

47:33.240 --> 47:35.240
areas within home that have done that,

47:35.240 --> 47:38.240
but to see that kind of actually integrated with a game

47:38.240 --> 47:39.240
was kind of neat.

47:39.240 --> 47:42.240
And not just a game like how Namco Museum Essentials

47:42.240 --> 47:44.240
was a game that would unlock stuff in home,

47:44.240 --> 47:47.240
but the game was actually in home,

47:47.240 --> 47:49.240
and that that all worked together very seamlessly.

47:49.240 --> 47:52.240
It kind of made me go, huh,

47:52.240 --> 47:56.240
this really feels like what home was advertised as

47:56.240 --> 47:58.240
a year and a half ago.

47:58.240 --> 48:02.240
Games and social interaction working seamlessly together.

48:02.240 --> 48:05.240
It's just a bummer that I feel like the game I'm playing here

48:05.240 --> 48:09.240
I played back in 1996 on a modem on my PC,

48:09.240 --> 48:11.240
but, okay, it's a step forward.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.240
You know what I mean?

48:13.240 --> 48:16.240
They were, it was a neat game, but it's just like,

48:16.240 --> 48:17.240
I don't know.

48:17.240 --> 48:19.240
And to be fair, maybe I didn't see enough

48:19.240 --> 48:21.240
in the first few levels that you're able to play.

48:21.240 --> 48:23.240
I was just talking about it, just like it's like this

48:23.240 --> 48:26.240
really revolutionary thing, and I just didn't see it.

48:26.240 --> 48:28.240
I was like, oh great, it's another space in home.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.240
Awesome.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.240
Well, because I think for home, it is doing something new.

48:33.240 --> 48:36.240
For the concept of home, I mean,

48:36.240 --> 48:39.240
we still don't have our trophy room with our trophies in it,

48:39.240 --> 48:41.240
so what else do we have to look forward to in home?

48:41.240 --> 48:44.240
Oh, the game integration and the way that it's going to

48:44.240 --> 48:46.240
integrate with the rest of the PlayStation brand.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.240
So I see this as a step forward.

48:49.240 --> 48:52.240
It's not a big step forward, but it was neat.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.240
I was entertained for an hour.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.240
For free.

48:55.240 --> 48:58.240
I did get the walk around still as my creepy Santa Claus,

48:58.240 --> 49:01.240
which this time of year is very relevant.

49:01.240 --> 49:04.240
You know, dressed like a Santa Claus.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.240
One of the dollies just passed out from excitement,

49:06.240 --> 49:08.240
apparently, over the snooze.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.240
Ooh, crazy.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.240
I just don't have a very stable place to put her.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.240
Sorry.

49:14.240 --> 49:17.240
But anyhow, I don't know.

49:17.240 --> 49:20.240
I'm curious to see where this leads in 2010.

49:20.240 --> 49:21.240
I don't know.

49:21.240 --> 49:23.240
Some folks in chat are asking about the OLR Clubhouse.

49:23.240 --> 49:25.240
Yes, on Sony Home, we have an OLR Clubhouse.

49:25.240 --> 49:27.240
It might be full.

49:27.240 --> 49:29.240
I think we have 25 members in it now.

49:29.240 --> 49:30.240
I haven't been joined yet, and it's full already.

49:30.240 --> 49:31.240
Is it?

49:31.240 --> 49:32.240
Have you tried?

49:32.240 --> 49:33.240
I don't know.

49:33.240 --> 49:37.240
Try to send a request to the Orange Lounge Radio.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.240
It's in there if you search for it.

49:39.240 --> 49:42.240
Honestly, I think you type OLRME is like the keyword,

49:42.240 --> 49:44.240
O-L-R-M-Y, and it'll come up.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.240
And you should be able to join it.

49:46.240 --> 49:48.240
And they're saying in chat, make another if it's full.

49:48.240 --> 49:51.240
Dude, I already had to pay for the first one.

49:51.240 --> 49:53.240
And here's my deal.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.240
I will gladly build five clubhouses

49:55.240 --> 49:58.240
if they give me something to do in this clubhouse

49:58.240 --> 50:00.240
that's really unique.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.240
You know what I mean?

50:01.240 --> 50:03.240
Let me do the Twitter feed on the TV.

50:03.240 --> 50:05.240
Let me put a custom video.

50:05.240 --> 50:08.240
Let me put down a radio that will play MP3s from this program.

50:08.240 --> 50:10.240
You know, that'll play the rant from earlier tonight

50:10.240 --> 50:11.240
or something.

50:11.240 --> 50:13.240
You know, let me do something with home

50:13.240 --> 50:15.240
other than just have a space to chat in

50:15.240 --> 50:18.240
because that's what the rest of home is, you know?

50:18.240 --> 50:20.240
Exactly.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.240
Deathwishing is saying request.

50:22.240 --> 50:25.240
So I thought I approved all the pending requests.

50:25.240 --> 50:29.240
So I will go in tonight and make sure it's all approved.

50:29.240 --> 50:31.240
But if it's full, I don't know what to tell you.

50:31.240 --> 50:32.240
You might be screwed.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.240
I'm sorry.

50:33.240 --> 50:35.240
But at least you'll have this to look forward to.

50:35.240 --> 50:37.240
Something on PBS.

50:37.240 --> 50:40.240
That's right, PBS, the Public Broadcast System.

50:40.240 --> 50:42.240
Most popularly known maybe for the Lawrence Welk show.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.240
I don't know.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.240
Reading Rainbow, Rob.

50:44.240 --> 50:45.240
Of course.

50:45.240 --> 50:46.240
Sesame Street.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.240
Doctor Who.

50:47.240 --> 50:48.240
That's right.

50:48.240 --> 50:49.240
Early Doctor Who.

50:49.240 --> 50:50.240
And a lot of great British imports.

50:50.240 --> 50:51.240
Obviously, okay.

50:51.240 --> 50:52.240
The Red Dwarf.

50:52.240 --> 50:53.240
The Public Broadcasting System.

50:53.240 --> 50:55.240
All kidding aside, you know the types of stuff

50:55.240 --> 50:56.240
they show on here.

50:56.240 --> 50:57.240
Masterpiece Theater.

50:57.240 --> 51:00.240
And a lot of times, a lot of orchestral concerts

51:00.240 --> 51:02.240
and a lot of like, you know, things you would see

51:02.240 --> 51:04.240
at like an opera house and so forth.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.240
So it might surprise you to know that PBS

51:06.240 --> 51:11.240
is planning to record and air video games live in 2010.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.240
That's right.

51:12.240 --> 51:15.240
The thing that was kind of meant to bridge that gap

51:15.240 --> 51:18.240
between the video game community and A Night at the Opera,

51:18.240 --> 51:21.240
although, you know, in talking to Tommy Tallarico,

51:21.240 --> 51:23.240
the brains behind this before,

51:23.240 --> 51:25.240
I don't think he wants people to think video game live

51:25.240 --> 51:27.240
is A Night at the Opera because it's not.

51:27.240 --> 51:31.240
But it definitely kind of, it's an interesting evolution

51:31.240 --> 51:35.240
of that, I suppose you could say, for a new generation.

51:35.240 --> 51:38.240
They're actually going to do this live performance

51:38.240 --> 51:41.240
on February 5th in New Orleans at the Lakefront Arena

51:41.240 --> 51:43.240
and on February 5th of 2010, they're gonna tape this.

51:43.240 --> 51:46.240
You can get tickets now through Ticketmaster.

51:46.240 --> 51:50.240
And it's actually going to air sometime in June.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.240
And apparently also a DVD and Blu-ray

51:52.240 --> 51:54.240
because PBS puts out a lot of their programming

51:54.240 --> 51:58.240
on DVD, Blu-ray to kind of raise money for the stations

51:58.240 --> 52:00.240
because, you know, they're all publicly funded and so forth.

52:00.240 --> 52:03.240
So, you know, sales from those will go to help fund PBS.

52:03.240 --> 52:05.240
So that's kind of cool for those that were looking to,

52:05.240 --> 52:07.240
you know, especially if you live in a place

52:07.240 --> 52:10.240
that doesn't get video games live coming there,

52:10.240 --> 52:12.240
although they've gone to a lot of places,

52:12.240 --> 52:14.240
you'll have an opportunity to see the show.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.240
So that's pretty cool.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.240
If you're going to dress, though, dress to impress

52:18.240 --> 52:19.240
because you might be on TV.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.240
Just something to think about.

52:21.240 --> 52:23.240
Yeah, Tiger Conchat says, that would be cool.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.240
I get PBS and HD.

52:24.240 --> 52:26.240
That's true, you know, considering we're talking Blu-ray

52:26.240 --> 52:29.240
and PBS, PBS was like the first channel

52:29.240 --> 52:31.240
I remember seeing going HD.

52:31.240 --> 52:34.240
I think PBS was in HD long before NBC

52:34.240 --> 52:35.240
and the other folks got on board.

52:35.240 --> 52:37.240
So it's going to look good.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.240
It's going to look good.

52:38.240 --> 52:40.240
You'll get to see all of Tommy's outfit changes

52:40.240 --> 52:41.240
in high definition.

52:41.240 --> 52:44.240
It'll be quite impressive.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.240
But if that doesn't interest you,

52:45.240 --> 52:47.240
maybe Dark Sakura has something that will.

52:47.240 --> 52:52.240
Well, you know, we covered the Alien vs. Predator

52:52.240 --> 52:54.240
not being approved in Australia

52:54.240 --> 52:58.240
and Sega actually appealed it and won.

52:58.240 --> 53:00.240
So it looks like Alien vs. Predator

53:00.240 --> 53:02.240
is going to be released in Australia

53:02.240 --> 53:04.240
with an MA15 Plus title,

53:04.240 --> 53:07.240
which is pretty much the goal they had anyway

53:07.240 --> 53:10.240
because from this quote it says,

53:10.240 --> 53:11.240
It is for adults.

53:11.240 --> 53:12.240
It is bloody and frightening.

53:12.240 --> 53:14.240
That was our intent.

53:14.240 --> 53:20.240
So basically they're saying that they're going to leave it

53:20.240 --> 53:24.240
to the reasonable expectations of adults to,

53:24.240 --> 53:26.240
you know, whether or not they want to get the game or not.

53:26.240 --> 53:29.240
I seem to remember talking about this in a previous episode

53:29.240 --> 53:31.240
and the fact that the makers behind that game

53:31.240 --> 53:35.240
are very cold and unwilling to budge on this

53:35.240 --> 53:38.240
is that we made this game and we are not changing it

53:38.240 --> 53:40.240
and if you are not a responsible enough adult to play it,

53:40.240 --> 53:41.240
then don't play it.

53:41.240 --> 53:45.240
But we're not changing it because you can't handle it.

53:45.240 --> 53:48.240
I have to admire it.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.240
They might go down in flames,

53:50.240 --> 53:53.240
but I have to admire them not wanting to budge.

53:53.240 --> 53:55.240
Stick to them guns and maintain some integrity.

53:55.240 --> 53:56.240
Gold star for all of you kids.

53:56.240 --> 53:58.240
No selling out.

53:58.240 --> 54:01.240
Do you think other places have sold out, Rob?

54:01.240 --> 54:03.240
Like other game companies?

54:03.240 --> 54:05.240
Yeah.

54:05.240 --> 54:08.240
One could claim that Valve and so forth sold out

54:08.240 --> 54:10.240
when they made those changes to get the game released

54:10.240 --> 54:12.240
in Australia and so forth.

54:12.240 --> 54:16.240
Well, hold on, let me say this and then I'll go on the tangent.

54:16.240 --> 54:20.240
I don't know if that was so much selling out as it was

54:20.240 --> 54:23.240
they did what they had to do to release the game.

54:23.240 --> 54:26.240
People in movies do this all the time.

54:26.240 --> 54:29.240
I mean, if you think these guys are bad in the other countries,

54:29.240 --> 54:31.240
look at what they do right here in America

54:31.240 --> 54:33.240
with the Motion Picture Association.

54:33.240 --> 54:34.240
No, no.

54:34.240 --> 54:37.240
Heaven forbid you show a vagina or a penis in your movie

54:37.240 --> 54:40.240
or you're going to get smacked with an NC-17 rating

54:40.240 --> 54:43.240
and no theater house in America is going to show your movie.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.240
Life of Brian does not have an NC-17 rating

54:45.240 --> 54:46.240
and it's got full frontal.

54:46.240 --> 54:49.240
But it's also a lot older, I think,

54:49.240 --> 54:51.240
when movies were fitting into the X category

54:51.240 --> 54:53.240
or it might have still been R.

54:53.240 --> 54:54.240
I don't think that it was R.

54:54.240 --> 54:57.240
For some reason in the 70s, like Porky's and a lot of these movies

54:57.240 --> 54:59.240
somehow got under the radar.

54:59.240 --> 55:01.240
But you know, in this day and age, let's face it,

55:01.240 --> 55:04.240
a movie like Showgirls got a rating like NC-17

55:04.240 --> 55:08.240
not because it was bad but because it had a lot of tits and ass.

55:08.240 --> 55:12.240
But heaven forbid they show tits and ass in a movie

55:12.240 --> 55:16.240
but it's okay to show, you know, torture porn.

55:16.240 --> 55:20.240
Movies like Hostel and Saw and all these movies are A-okay.

55:20.240 --> 55:23.240
They play them at the multiplexes across America.

55:23.240 --> 55:27.240
I mean, it's the same thing.

55:27.240 --> 55:31.240
So if you think this type of sensor and directors and so forth

55:31.240 --> 55:34.240
change their movies all the time to get down to the R rating

55:34.240 --> 55:37.240
because they know if they release it with an NC-17 rating,

55:37.240 --> 55:39.240
they're screwed. They'll never make the money back on the movie.

55:39.240 --> 55:41.240
The studios force them to do it.

55:41.240 --> 55:44.240
They are contractually obliged to deliver a certain rating.

55:44.240 --> 55:46.240
Once in a while you get those indie studios.

55:46.240 --> 55:48.240
They're like, if you are releasing our unrated movie,

55:48.240 --> 55:50.240
you know, once in a while you see those slip through the cracks

55:50.240 --> 55:52.240
but unfortunately they don't make money.

55:52.240 --> 55:55.240
Or you get the unrated version for a home release.

55:55.240 --> 55:57.240
Yeah.

55:57.240 --> 56:00.240
And some folks in chat are saying X movie has Full Frontal

56:00.240 --> 56:02.240
and Y movie has Full Frontal.

56:02.240 --> 56:04.240
Okay, yeah. Okay, fine.

56:04.240 --> 56:06.240
You know, you can show a little peen and a little vag and get away with it

56:06.240 --> 56:09.240
but, you know, usually you have to appeal it to get the rating

56:09.240 --> 56:13.240
and let's face it, you and I, you the listener and I,

56:13.240 --> 56:18.240
the hosts can agree that the standards between violence and nudity

56:18.240 --> 56:20.240
are way different. Come on.

56:20.240 --> 56:23.240
You can't show penetration in a movie

56:23.240 --> 56:25.240
but you can show a bullet going through someone's brain.

56:25.240 --> 56:28.240
You can show that penetration.

56:28.240 --> 56:31.240
Just saying.

56:31.240 --> 56:34.240
What if you fired a penis instead of a bullet

56:34.240 --> 56:37.240
and it penetrated instead of their head, a vagina?

56:37.240 --> 56:39.240
Would that still count if it's fired from a gun?

56:39.240 --> 56:42.240
NC-17. A cum shot is always going to get you NC-17.

56:42.240 --> 56:44.240
Always.

56:44.240 --> 56:46.240
No way are they ever going to let that slide in an unrated movie

56:46.240 --> 56:48.240
and I would cite two movies.

56:48.240 --> 56:50.240
Happiness, which was released unreleased.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.240
It's actually a really good movie.

56:52.240 --> 56:54.240
It's by the guy who did Welcome to the Dollhouse.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.240
It's pretty good.

56:56.240 --> 56:58.240
That came out about 10, 12 years ago

56:58.240 --> 57:00.240
and it got an NC-17 rating because

57:00.240 --> 57:02.240
you don't actually see the cum shot.

57:02.240 --> 57:04.240
You just see the cum hit in the wall

57:04.240 --> 57:06.240
but because that's so hideously disgusting, you know,

57:06.240 --> 57:10.240
and immoral, it got an NC-17 rating.

57:10.240 --> 57:13.240
And then there was a movie that came out a couple years ago, Shortbus,

57:13.240 --> 57:16.240
that was just full-on explicit sex in the movie.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.240
It was great.

57:18.240 --> 57:20.240
But the cool thing, it was by the guy who did Headwig and the Angry Inch.

57:20.240 --> 57:23.240
And the interesting thing about it is that he set out to make a movie.

57:23.240 --> 57:26.240
His goal was to make a movie with porn in it

57:26.240 --> 57:28.240
that was not about the sex.

57:28.240 --> 57:31.240
And I have to say, he made a pretty damn good movie.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.240
I wouldn't say you should see it if you're under 17,

57:33.240 --> 57:36.240
but if you are of age, I think it's a fine movie.

57:36.240 --> 57:38.240
I really liked that movie.

57:38.240 --> 57:40.240
I thought it was a great movie too.

57:40.240 --> 57:44.240
I liked The Lady and it was in Hedwig.

57:44.240 --> 57:46.240
SalaciousPopInChat brings up a good point.

57:46.240 --> 57:49.240
They did that in Scary Movie 2, Dick in the Head.

57:49.240 --> 57:51.240
I forgot about that.

57:51.240 --> 57:53.240
That is true. You didn't see Balls though.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.240
Maybe it's not penis people have a problem with.

57:55.240 --> 57:57.240
It's balls.

57:57.240 --> 57:58.240
It's just like breasts.

57:58.240 --> 58:01.240
You know, the breast is okay, but the nipple, oh my god, no.

58:01.240 --> 58:03.240
Alright.

58:03.240 --> 58:06.240
Anyhow, let's move around the country and cover some release dates.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.240
Things that are okay.

58:08.240 --> 58:11.240
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot a tangent.

58:11.240 --> 58:14.240
And one of our folks that works for Orange Andrea

58:14.240 --> 58:16.240
would want me to say something about this on air.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.240
Dekeman, because he posted this to the Twitter earlier this week.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.240
Did you hear about the Australian censorship

58:20.240 --> 58:22.240
and the fact that they are looking at,

58:22.240 --> 58:24.240
and I don't know if this is somebody running with us,

58:24.240 --> 58:28.240
they are looking at installing basically China-like restrictions on their internet

58:28.240 --> 58:31.240
and filtering out objectionable sites.

58:31.240 --> 58:33.240
Quote,

58:33.240 --> 58:36.240
This is really going to hurt your tough man edge, Australia.

58:36.240 --> 58:39.240
I mean, seriously, it was all about crocodile hunters

58:39.240 --> 58:41.240
and beer drinking and kangaroos over there.

58:41.240 --> 58:43.240
That's not an internet.

58:43.240 --> 58:46.240
And, and, don't forget the transvestites.

58:46.240 --> 58:51.240
But now it's just like, you know, censored internet.

58:51.240 --> 58:54.240
I hope that just got misconstrued.

58:54.240 --> 58:55.240
I really hope.

58:55.240 --> 58:57.240
And Dekeman posted it to our Twitter.

58:57.240 --> 58:59.240
It was a little disheartening.

58:59.240 --> 59:02.240
I think that any type of censorship is, you know,

59:02.240 --> 59:05.240
the only people who I think should be allowed to censor

59:05.240 --> 59:09.240
are parents and people censoring themselves.

59:09.240 --> 59:13.240
But if I'm not mistaking, Australia has a parliament-style government,

59:13.240 --> 59:15.240
which means they do have elected officials.

59:15.240 --> 59:18.240
So, Australians, if you're listening and you disagree with this,

59:18.240 --> 59:22.240
vote your politicians the fuck out of office immediately.

59:22.240 --> 59:25.240
Unless, of course, they were the politicians that were against this.

59:25.240 --> 59:27.240
But I believe in your country.

59:27.240 --> 59:31.240
You do vote, and you vote these people the fuck out

59:31.240 --> 59:33.240
that are trying to do this.

59:33.240 --> 59:36.240
Anyhow, let's move on to happier topics.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.240
A lot of angst tonight.

59:38.240 --> 59:41.240
I swear, I'm actually in a really good mood, all things considered.

59:41.240 --> 59:44.240
Life is pretty good right now.

59:44.240 --> 59:45.240
I can't complain.

59:45.240 --> 59:48.240
So I don't know why we're having such an angsty show tonight.

59:48.240 --> 59:52.240
OLR, quit trying to bring me down.

59:52.240 --> 59:54.240
Alright, not much coming up this week in the US.

59:54.240 --> 59:56.240
Mainly three games.

59:56.240 --> 59:59.240
Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out on PlayStation 2.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.240
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.240
That is, of course, if you didn't get it free with Guitar Hero 5

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.240
during the month of September.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.240
Twin Sector being released on PC.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.240
And finally, on the Wii, we have Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles,

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.240
The Crystal Bears, coming out on the Wii.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.240
The first real good Wii Final Fantasy game.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.240
That's the one that they've been advertising ever since the damn thing launched, right?

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.240
Yep, that would be the one.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.240
Well, moving over to Japan, honestly, it's pretty dried up over there, too.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.240
I mean, you've got your Final Fantasy XIII now,

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.240
which I have seen trophies popping up on my Facebook friend feed,

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.240
so I know I have friends that imported this stuff, and they're playing away on it.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.240
Not one of them.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.240
So now things are dying down a little bit there,

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.240
but that's not to say there's nothing coming out.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.240
I mean, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360 is getting a price reduction this week in Japan,

01:00:53.240 --> 01:01:00.240
as well as Infernal, Hell's Vengeance is a new game coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.240
On the PlayStation 3, it sounds like a new Hori arcade stick is coming out,

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.240
but that is really it.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.240
There's no new releases on the particular system,

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.240
which, considering the games usually come out Friday over there,

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.240
and Friday is Christmas Eve, not going to really see a whole lot, probably.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.240
Nintendo Wii, same story.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.240
Going over to the PlayStation 2,

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.240
there is a Neo Geo Online Collection Complete Box, Volumes 1 and 2.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.240
That is something new coming out over there,

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.240
but really that's just rehashed old stuff.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:35.240
And on the Nintendo DS, Zelda no Densetsu Taoyu no Kiteki.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.240
Anyone want to guess what that is on the Nintendo DS?

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240
I would say The Train Game.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.240
It is The Train Game.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.240
Gets its release this week in Japan,

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.240
so that is probably the big release in Japan this week.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.240
Quickly looking on the PSP,

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.240
there are actually a few things you might care about on the PSP.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.240
Assassin's Creed Bloodlines in Japan this week,

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.240
Lucky Star Net Idle Meister,

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.240
and Metal Slug XX all make its way to the PSP.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.240
So, funny enough,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.240
the system that seems to be having the biggest week is the PSP.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240
Go, Fig.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240
There you go.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.240
Some stupid candle won't light.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240
Oops, and I got my days mixed up.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.240
Tiger Class says Thursday is Christmas Eve,

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.240
actually Friday is Christmas Day, so, sorry.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.240
Eh, who keeps up with Christmas anymore?

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:15.240
The releases are getting all messed up because of the holidays, anyway.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.240
So.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.240
Well, it's pretty much dry in the UK.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.240
Just one game on the 22nd.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.240
Well, one game came out today,

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.240
Nicky Rock and Ball.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.240
Well, I should say Yesterday now for them,

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.240
because it's the 20th already.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.240
On the 22nd is Savage Moon The Hera Campaign on PSP.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.240
That's about it.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.240
Couple more news stories for you guys,

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.240
and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.240
here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.240
It looks like it's going to be a good one tonight.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.240
I peeked at what DarkSakura picked,

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.240
and it's one that I wholeheartedly endorse.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.240
Speaking about Final Fantasy XIII,

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.240
it did pretty well this week,

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.240
including 1 million copies sold within,

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.240
I believe, the first 24 hours, yes.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240
Wow.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240
Over 2 million copies sold.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240
I know they shipped 2 million,

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.240
so probably between 1 and 2 million copies sold.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:17.240
Of course, that includes the Lightning Edition PS3

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:24.240
with the silkscreen pink, I guess, portrait of lightning.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.240
Yeah, we still have to wait a few months.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.240
So it's basically the equivalent of a Modern Warfare 2 here,

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.240
which sold what?

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.240
Didn't they say it sold like 7 million in the first week,

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.240
or some huge amount?

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.240
A Halo 3 sold millions.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.240
This is kind of the equivalent over there.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.240
Heck yeah.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.240
Which surprises probably no one.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.240
But the real question is,

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.240
what will happen when the game comes out here?

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.240
Will it move a million in one night here?

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.240
I don't think it will.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.240
It'll move a million overall,

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.240
but it won't move a million in the first night.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.240
Oh yeah, it will.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.240
No way.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.240
I hope I'm wrong.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.240
We'll see.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.240
Anyhow, one other thing.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.240
And this is something actually new that directly affects me,

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240
because I participated in it this week.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.240
Squeenix is now accepting beta applications for Final Fantasy XIV.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.240
So if you're skipping Final Fantasy XIII,

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.240
maybe you are looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.240
That's right.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.240
The applications are now open for the Final Fantasy XIV beta.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.240
Please note, this is only the Windows edition.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240
They're not doing, it looks like,

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.240
what they did on the PlayStation 2 for Final Fantasy XI,

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.240
where they actually were shipping hard drives to people

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240
to beta test that,

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.240
and they could keep them as a thank you gift.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.240
That's not the case here.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.240
You will have to sign up for only the Windows version,

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.240
at least for right now.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.240
They are doing the PS3 version as well,

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.240
but you can sign up for it, but it's not now.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.240
Maybe I'll sign up for the beta.

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.240
You know, might as well.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.240
Sign up for it, and then if I don't get in, I'll take yours.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.240
How's that?

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.240
I already had one friend do that for me.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.240
I'm trying to find friends to sign up.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.240
I'm like, if you get in and I don't, I want it.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.240
But anyhow...

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.240
I just don't know if I'm...

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:08.240
Honestly, I hardly have time to play World of Warcraft,

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.240
and Star Trek Online's coming out.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.240
I know, I'm in the same boat, but like, seriously,

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.240
I will push World of Warcraft to the side for a little while

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.240
to focus on this, if it's good.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.240
If they've learned from their mistakes from XI,

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.240
which I still think XI was a solid game for its time,

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.240
it just didn't age well.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.240
You know, I think if they really have kind of combined

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.240
the best parts of that with the best parts of World of Warcraft,

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.240
this game could be pretty awesome.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.240
So I want to check it out.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.240
Anyhow, though, just so you know,

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.240
you need to be 18 years old in order to apply.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.240
You have to be fluent in English,

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.240
which, if you're listening to this show, I'm assuming you are.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.240
Or you could be fluent in Japanese, French, or German,

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.240
because I know we do have some listeners in Japan

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.240
and even some of those other countries there.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.240
And apparently, though, a PS3 one will come out later.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.240
It's just that right now you can only sign up for the PC version.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.240
Also, no MMORPG experience required,

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.240
but I will tell you, since I did sign up,

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.240
I was prepared to fill out a little bit of a questionnaire

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.240
about your gaming experience,

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:09.240
which is translated from a Japanese version, you can kind of tell.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.240
But yeah, let us know.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.240
If any of you OLR people get in, let me know so I can be jealous,

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.240
especially if I don't get in.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.240
This would use my Play Online ID, right?

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.240
No, it doesn't. I think they're going away from Play Online.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.240
It's a whole new login.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.240
I tried my Play Online ID and it didn't work.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.240
Anyhow, moving on, and something you don't need Play Online for

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.240
is to access the Classic Game of the Week.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.240
That's right, every week here on the show,

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.240
DarkSakura takes a walk through gaming's history

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.240
by stepping into the vault and picking a classic game that she says,

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.240
You know what, darn it?

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.240
You guys ought to be playing this game.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.240
DarkSakura, what did you pick for the game this week?

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:50.240
Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.240
Great pick. I'll have the music here shortly.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.240
Firefox had to reboot, so I'll get the music here in a moment.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:00.240
Fun. Well, the game originally came out in Japan in 1987

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:08.240
for the Famicon Disk System, as did the third one, too.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:14.240
It came out in the US in cartridge form in 1988.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:21.240
It's a little bit of a different game than the first one.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.240
It has some RPG elements you can go and of course talk to the townsfolk

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.240
and then have what a horrible night for a curse

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:35.240
when you go and jump in on the zombies

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:40.240
and things that wander around the countryside when nightfall hits, apparently.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:47.240
You do have to buy items, which you'll need to get to different areas.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.240
You have to get hearts.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.240
And you can also buy new whips as you keep going on.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.240
You have an experience rating system,

01:07:55.240 --> 01:08:00.240
so your experience rating increases, of course, as you collect hearts.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.240
And that's actually something that made it into Dracula X.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.240
Not Dracula X, but Symphony of the Night, if you'll remember.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.240
And as you can probably hear there a little bit of, I did get the music to come up.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.240
So, of course, Castlevania II, who did not love the music in this game?

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.240
Now we have some of the music playing in the background.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.240
That's right.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:32.240
But anyway, I'll listen to it for a little bit.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.240
Easily one of the ten best songs ever in a video game. Easily.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.240
Yeah.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.240
Anyway, the whole point of the game is that you have to go to different mansions

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.240
to find different parts of Dracula's corpse and then the magic cross.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:53.240
So, you can actually use the different body parts as power-ups, kind of.

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.240
Like the rib bone is a shield.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:03.240
And then, once you get everything, you can clear the blockade to Dracula's castle and fight.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.240
So, yeah.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:11.240
It was directed by Akamatsu, who also did Castlevania III.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:21.240
And it had a password system for the US version as opposed to the save system that the Famicom Disk System had.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.240
You know, like, side bike? Hello.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:33.240
There's also some pretty crazy English in the game, like naming Simon Simon, like with two M's.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:43.240
And there's, you know, of course, the music in it was done by Matsubara Kenichi,

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:49.240
who did the Castlevania Arcade, the Haunted Castle.

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:56.240
And they also used some of that for Simon's Quest.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:06.240
It also has the different parts of the game, you know, the statues and things, crying blood.

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.240
So, lots of cool stuff going on.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.240
Also, it actually, the game caused some controversy in the US with Nintendo Power.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:22.240
It was the second issue of Nintendo Power that had the Simon's Quest cover,

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.240
and it was also in Howard and Nestor, if you remember Howard and Nestor.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:32.240
But the cover apparently scared children.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.240
So, caused a little problem.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.240
I got in trouble in grade school over this magazine.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.240
And it had nothing to do with the cover, actually.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.240
It's just that I brought it to school one day and I was trying to show a friend of mine during class.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.240
The teacher was pissed at me.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.240
But I was so excited, because it was Castlevania II and it was awesome.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240
Yep.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:58.240
Also, with this particular one, it was actually the first in the series that got away from linear gameplay

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.240
and inspired, actually, Symphony of the Night.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:05.240
Not necessarily Metroid-inspired, Rob.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.240
And...

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.240
Debatable, but okay.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:18.240
Certainly this game was so different from the first Castlevania that you already kind of started splitting up the series in a way at this point.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:28.240
But, I just have to say real quick, it was very interesting in the 8-bit era how deviant sequels were of the original.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:32.240
Like, you think about Super Mario Bros. 2, way different than the first one.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.240
Super Mario Bros. 2 was a different game.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:40.240
I know, I know, but still, our perception of it as kids, you know, not knowing this whole Japanese stuff, was way different here.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.240
You know, Castlevania II was really different.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.240
Mega Man 2 was kind of different.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.240
You know, a lot of sequels in the 8-bit era were really different than the original game.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.240
I can't say that Mega Man 2 was at all different.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:59.240
Each of the Mega Man games on the, um, the NES just kept adding different things and changing different, but they all pretty much kept the same formula.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.240
Even the X series kept the same formula.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:13.240
I can't really say that those weren't too different, but this, in this case, this one is a fairly big departure from how the first one went.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:21.240
But then what was also particularly weird about this, and Super Mario Bros., I guess you could say, is that they both went kind of back to the formula of the original in the third game.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:26.240
Although, Super Mario debatable, but Castlevania definitely went back to kind of the formula of the first game.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.240
Keep in mind, Super Mario 2 in Japan was what we got as, um, the lost levels.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.240
Sure, sure.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.240
And it was, just like the first one, only harder.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.240
Right.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.240
And it had the, um, the poison mushrooms and stuff.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:47.240
So, yeah, I think Mario, actually, if you look at it with the actual successors to the original, that one kept the same formula, too.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.240
But, um...

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.240
Okay, I have to say real quick from chat, because this is a really good point, Black Wolf, our good pal Bobby Black Wolf says,

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.240
The platformer in Retro Game Challenge was different in all three versions.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.240
Even in that game, they made the sequel so different.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240
That's kind of like an inside joke.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:08.240
Well, at any rate, um, something that might be interesting to other people, this is from an interview in 2002,

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:13.240
is Igarashi Koji, who is, like, one of my video game heroes and who I got a hug from.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240
I'm so happy.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:27.240
Um, actually, uh, was talking about considering a compilation of the NES titles for, um, for, uh, I suppose, um, either Game Boy or PC, so...

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:32.240
Well, I seem to recall there was an 8-bit collection that came out that had the...

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.240
Yeah, there was. This was actually in response to the compilation.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.240
Gotcha.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.240
So, but anyway, this is a cool game.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:44.240
Very, very good pick tonight. Uh, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, one of my absolute favorite 8-bit games that ever existed.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.240
I love this music right here.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.240
That's the very first song you hear when you press start.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.240
This isn't Bloody Tears.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:00.240
If nothing else, just, like, one of the best music game soundtracks you'll ever hear.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.240
You know, I do have to say there is a Castlevania game that has a better soundtrack.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.240
Hmm.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.240
But in my opinion, it's Dracula X.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:13.240
Not just because it was Redbook Audio, because I actually like the process, the music on the SNES version better in some cases.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.240
Mm-hmm.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.240
But it did have some fantastic mixes of the songs.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:25.240
So, but I'd have to put this up there, at least as far as the, the SNES titles go. That one's probably got my favorite music in it.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:33.240
Interesting. Our other pal, Bress Lowell in chat, who, uh, of course is a co-host on Understation Live, says, uh, Simon's Quest is actually my least favorite Castlevania game.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.240
Now, if you want to see something really funny about Simon's Quest, just look for the Angry Nintendo Nerd.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.240
Yeah.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.240
His version, his description of it was fantastic.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:51.240
Um, I have to say my least favorite Castlevania game, and I, I know this is one of your favorites, Jamie, but Castlevania V on the SNES was ruined for me.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.240
Five?

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.240
Just, it was, well, right? Because it was, it was supposed to be the port of Dracula.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.240
It was, it came out as Dracula X.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.240
Didn't they call it Dracula V?

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.240
No, they called it Dracula X.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.240
I thought, I thought in a magazine it was like Castlevania V.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.240
I've got the box, it says Dracula X.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:09.240
Alright. But I, I just thought at some point I remember referring to it as Castlevania V, but it, well.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.240
Because it did come out after Super Castlevania IV.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.240
Right. But it was so...

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:20.240
Yeah, no, it was, it was really, I would have to say neutered.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.240
It was, it was a castrated version of Dracula X.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.240
Rob, you're gonna have to come over some night and just play through Dracula X with me.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.240
It'll be fun.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.240
On the, um, the NeoGeo. We'll have to put, we'll have to put a feet up.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.240
Rob, Rob playing as Maria.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.240
La la la, la la la la.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.240
One of her attacks is singing.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.240
Nice.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:42.240
She sings badly that it kills, like, everything around her, and her little singing is la la la la la la.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.240
Like that.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.240
Uh, also you're forgetting, uh, I think Bresloul might be neglecting Castlevania Judgment.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.240
Huh? What? Who?

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.240
The fighting game on Wii?

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.240
What? I, I don't, what?

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.240
Oh, I see. That doesn't exist in your universe. I see.

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.240
Maybe Castlevania 64?

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.240
Oh, snap! That's right! Bresloul! Castlevania 64. I think Loki wins.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.240
That was pretty bad.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.240
That was definitely a low point in the Castlevania series.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.240
Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:15.240
We're going to take a quick break, though, and we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so please stay tuned.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.240
We will be right back.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.240
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, where we are live with our 349th episode of the show.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.240
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:40.240
www.allgames.com, and thanks to the folks there that help let us take over the stream and do our little show every Sunday night.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.240
We really appreciate it.

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:47.240
So before we get back into some gaming news tonight, we've had some rants and stuff, and I got angry earlier in the show,

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:50.240
but obviously I saved this for later in the show.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.240
It turns out I might be wrong. I might have been wrong.

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.240
And I don't like to admit when I'm wrong, but apparently I was wrong.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.240
And it has to do with Avatar, that movie that came out.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.240
I was coming out here saying, oh, this movie's probably going to bomb.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.240
No one's going to fucking care about Avatar.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.240
Well, it was a 70-something million at the box office.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.240
I haven't heard a negative thing about it.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:16.240
I've heard that the plot is kind of meh, but that this movie is still amazing.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.240
I have seen lots of people on Facebook, on my friends list.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:24.240
I don't really trust critics, but I trust my friends that say, OMG, best movie ever.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.240
Or, OMG, what a great movie.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.240
So now I'm kind of sitting here going, damn, I might have to go see it.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.240
There's just a lot of people saying such great things about it.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240
Loki, did you go?

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.240
I did. I saw it in 3D.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.240
And?

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.240
It was awesome.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.240
Was it really?

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.240
It was good. It wasn't.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:43.240
If you're looking for an absolutely original plot, you're not going to get it with this.

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.240
You can see stuff coming before it happens and stuff like that.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.240
But it was beautiful.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:53.240
As far as looking at the movie from a CG standpoint,

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.240
a lot of the stuff was really seamless.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:02.240
The environments and everything completely rendered, so it looks absolutely gorgeous.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.240
And the 3D was awesome in it.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:10.240
It wasn't really just no gimmicky stuff where stuff's flying at your face and that kind of stuff.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.240
This is even better.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.240
I went to the new theaters that opened up in Folsom.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:21.240
This Paladio, I've never heard of this brand, but Cinema West.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:27.240
Other than having a really annoying little pre-show advertisement thing,

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:32.240
because they have before the movies and they have this really creepy looking rapist bee.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.240
Did you say a rapist bee?

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.240
Yeah, he looks like he could be a pedophile or a rapist.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.240
So they kept playing those advertisements.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:43.240
We hated the bee after about a minute.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:48.240
But they have the greatest innovations in cinema in that theater.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:54.240
Other than the fact that they're advertising that it's the largest solar-powered cinema in the world,

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.240
and the fact that it's all digital screens,

01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:01.240
they have gone innovative in an area that I never thought possible.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.240
They installed a toilet seat in the seat.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.240
No, no, no, no. Even better.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.240
Okay.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.240
Push a button, get beer.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.240
No, no, no, no. Even better.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:13.240
So I bought my popcorn and drink at the concession stand,

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:17.240
and I'm eating the popcorn and I'm like, man, this is really kind of dry.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.240
There's not a lot of butter on this.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.240
You know, what the hell?

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.240
I'm like, this new theater kind of sucks.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.240
Walk over to get my salt.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.240
What is there?

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.240
A butter pump.

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.240
Yes, you can put as much fucking butter on this popcorn as you want.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:35.240
And not only that, they have the season, you know, the different season popcorn toppings

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:39.240
that normally at the UA would charge you to get a little container of it.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.240
All free.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.240
Unlimited butter on this thing.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.240
I was like, oh my god, this is the greatest theater ever.

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.240
Oh my god, all you can eat butter?

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.240
Exactly.

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:55.240
There's only one thing better than butter, Loki, and that's more butter.

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.240
It's just the topping.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.240
I'm like, I don't know if I should push that button because I think, you know,

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.240
I would assume that butter is coming out of there,

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.240
but it could be like chocolate sauce or something like that.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.240
Usually it's like liquid magma that is kind of butter flavored.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.240
And so I pushed the button and butter popped out.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.240
I'm like, awesome.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.240
Push a button, get butter.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.240
Is that the directions?

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.240
Like, you know how they have directions on how to wash your hands?

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.240
Oh, there is no directions. It just said topping.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.240
It did not say butter topping. It just said topping.

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.240
I'm like, well, this could be like anything.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.240
Yeah, there's some people in chat saying, this isn't news, Loki.

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.240
My theater does that.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.240
Well, none of ours do, so it's news for me.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.240
Now, here's the ultimate question.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.240
Was there bacon seasoning?

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:43.240
Not that I'm aware of, but, you know, steps, baby steps.

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:45.240
I see. I see. It's a step in the right direction.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.240
Let's not bite off more than we can chew.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.240
And bacon salt's not that good. Trust me.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:55.240
You know, as cool of a concept as bacon salt is, it does not taste like bacon.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:00.240
All right. Anyhow, let's move on with some more topics tonight,

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.240
some other news stories.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.240
I just had to say that about Avatar.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.240
You know, I can man up and admit when I was wrong,

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.240
and I may have been wrong about Avatar.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.240
I can't say I was wrong about Avatar because I haven't seen it yet,

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.240
but I may have been wrong about it.

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.240
We'll see.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.240
It's pretty good. I'd go see it in the theater and in 3D.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.240
You have to see it in 3D.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.240
I will see it in 3D, I promise.

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.240
But I also have to see Princess and the Frog,

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.240
because I did get to meet Princess Tiana this weekend,

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.240
and she's mighty fierce.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.240
And I heard some of the songs from Princess and the Frog

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:31.240
in the little street show they do.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.240
I really want to see Princess and the Frog.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.240
So that's at the top of my list.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.240
And then maybe Avatar if my mom doesn't drag me to see Precious on Christmas,

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.240
which is likely.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.240
How about some gaming news?

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.240
Less movies, more games.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.240
Yes.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:51.240
So I guess we've got some rapid-fire news to go into here.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.240
Sure.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:58.240
Starting things off, Dead or Live is coming to the PSP,

01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.240
but not what you might think.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:04.240
Dead or Live Paradise, which is Dead or Live beach volleyball,

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.240
minus the volleyball.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.240
So it's just Dead or Live giggling girls in bikinis jumping around

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:15.240
watching their boobs move to music, the game.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:19.240
So that's awesome.

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240
Thank you, Tecmo.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.240
Why don't they just call it Boob Physics, the game?

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.240
Because that would be offensive.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:32.240
But yeah, so it'll be coming out spring 2010, and it's awesome.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.240
That's innovation right there.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.240
PSP 4000.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.240
No.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.240
That.

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:42.240
Speaking of fake boobs, Playboy has done their annual girls of video games.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.240
Their 2010 spread.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.240
And this year they'll be featuring women from such games as God of War,

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.240
Crimecraft, The Saboteur, Dante's Inferno, Mafia 2, and Heavy Rain,

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:58.240
including some characters I don't know because I haven't played those games yet.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:03.240
Skylar St. Clair from The Saboteur.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:08.240
Madison Page, I guess the main character from Heavy Rain is new in there as well.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.240
So if you want to see some fake naked boobies, I guess,

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:17.240
then pick up the January, February issue of Playboy.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.240
So now they're skipping months in Playboy.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.240
I mean, does it come down to that?

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.240
Is it bi-monthly now?

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.240
I don't know.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:31.240
And then finally, I still don't understand the idea of buying Playboy for video game rendered characters,

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:35.240
but I suppose either way you buy the magazine, the girls are fake.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.240
So, hey, whatever.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.240
They have Tara Reid on the cover, but I bet you she's not topless, even though she's a slut.

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.240
Oh, sorry.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:46.240
Would it be bad if I said, yeah, she is topless because I saw the pictures?

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.240
Okay, well, awesome.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:50.240
But still, that's not like, I don't know.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.240
But I'm saying it's about as real as the video game magazine spread.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.240
I'm just saying.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.240
I'm just saying.

01:23:55.240 --> 01:24:00.240
And finally, this Thursday, we're going to be getting some wonderful holiday treats as well.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:06.240
On the 22nd, not only will we be getting the download content for LittleBigPlanet,

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.240
which is going to be all sorts of awesome,

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:12.240
but we'll be getting the Gran Turismo 5 Time Trial Challenge.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:17.240
Of course, if you have a Japanese account, you can download that right now, and it's in English.

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:23.240
Puzzlegeddon, which I think came out last week on the...

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.240
The puzzle to destroy all puzzles.

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:26.240
Puzzlegeddon.

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.240
Puzzlegeddon.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:30.240
Let's see.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:39.240
Also, there will be, of course, Guitar Hero 5 songs, High Speed Soul by Nada Surf,

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.240
Sister Jack by Spoon, Cut Your Hair by Pavement,

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:48.240
and the Indie Rock Track Pack featuring all three of those as well.

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:53.240
And then, of course, the download content, which is really the most important thing.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:58.240
The PlayStation 1 classic, though, this week is going to be Final Fantasy VIII, and that's pretty awesome.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.240
Woohoo!

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:01.240
So, that'll be coming out on the 26th.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:02.240
Wait. Final Fantasy VIII?

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.240
VIII.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.240
Never mind.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.240
Hey, it's not Final Fantasy IX.

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.240
I thought they just skipped ahead to IX.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.240
No, no, no. Final Fantasy IX wasn't that...

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.240
Dude, I thought we ignored that VIII happened.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240
Listen, I liked VIII.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.240
I liked VIII.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.240
I'm just being dramatic.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.240
Except the last disc bored the crap out of me.

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.240
VIII had a good story.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.240
Y'all know how I feel about the battle system.

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:24.240
If you don't, I've ranted about it like 50 times in the history of this show.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.240
I got so tired of seeing mob bros.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.240
Seriously, I was like, they could not have come up with a better name for this stupid, ugly creature.

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:37.240
And then, of course, some PSP minis, Hercules, Chariot Racing, and Spot the Differences is the other game.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:43.240
Wait. Hold on. Spot the Differences is...

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.240
That's the name of the game. Spot the Differences.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.240
Do I even need to crack a joke here?

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.240
I mean, the jokes write themselves.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:54.240
They can have the PSP-2000 and the PSP-Go and it's like, what, one's crap? No?

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.240
Spot the Differences.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:03.240
That'd be awesome if we could make a game like that and just like completely obvious differences.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:09.240
Like, you know, one's a puppy, one's a Hiddenberg disaster, you know, some ridiculous stuff.

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.240
That'd be sweet.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:18.240
Puppy's less violent, right? No?

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:23.240
One's a picture of Brittany Murphy, one's a picture of Heath... Never mind, I better not go there.

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.240
She's a chick.

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.240
She didn't die from a drug overdose. Oh, wait. No, that's not probably it.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.240
Moving on.

01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:34.240
She was a joker.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.240
No?

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.240
I found something else I was looking for.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.240
Oh, I thought you found the differences we were talking about.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.240
No, I found something for you, Rob, that I wanted you to play during break and you didn't so you have to play it after the show.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.240
Fine. I have to, huh?

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.240
You have to.

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.240
I have to? Is it your Cage Match pick?

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.240
You know what, Rob? I will put it in Cage Match.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.240
Will you now?

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:57.240
Just because. Even though what I put in Cage Match was hilarious, you can make...

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.240
Okay, make my Cage Match thing the cookie.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.240
Alright. Well, fine.

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.240
Okay.

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.240
Alright.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.240
Actually, no, this is what I put for Cage Match is really damn funny.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.240
Cage Match should be a Brittany Murphy song.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.240
Death Wishing in Chat says that...

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:13.240
Okay, I'm gonna say this right now. Go call Rob.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240
Oh, no.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.240
I don't give a shit about Brittany Murphy or whoever the fuck she was.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.240
Don't care. I didn't know her.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.240
Sucks she's dead. Sucks for her family.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.240
I don't care. The end.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.240
Does Tara Reid sing any music?

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.240
I'm gonna put her in there.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.240
I don't know. I don't know.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:37.240
Anyhow...

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.240
It's like just suddenly the Hindenburg disaster...

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.240
Wait, hold on, hold on. Can you spot the difference?

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.240
Tonight's program...

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.240
Hindenburg disaster.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.240
Can you spot the difference?

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:57.240
Death Wishing might have found it in chat.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:01.240
It said, uh, pro tip, Hindenburg powered by puppies with cute kitten pilots.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.240
I want a picture of that.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.240
Alright, anyhow.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.240
Moving on.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.240
Can we get in some more, um...

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.240
Last minute star. Not last minute star.

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.240
See, I want the show to be over.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.240
Oh, Rob.

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.240
Rapid fire topics.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.240
Hey, there's a game called Zero Day Attack in Earth.

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.240
Coming to Xbox Live Marketplace on December 23rd.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.240
That's right, Martians invade the Earth, shoot them up, bang bang, blow up.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.240
Not the type of game that Square Enix is usually known for.

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.240
But, here's the kicker about the game.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.240
It uses satellite photography.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:40.240
So if you want to blow up real things, have a blast.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:46.240
Just don't blow up certain historical objects that aren't funny.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.240
You know what I mean?

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.240
Although, I do notice in this picture, I just happen to see the Eiffel Tower.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.240
And guns going pew pew pew.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:57.240
But I guess because it's Martians, it's okay.

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.240
It's just a science fiction thing.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.240
But I'm just saying.

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.240
This might be...

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.240
I can just see horrific YouTubes coming of this game.

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.240
That's all I'm saying.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.240
Horrific YouTubes even worse than the joke I told earlier.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.240
Uh, anyhow.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.240
And if you were offended by my earlier joke, I have to say to you,

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.240
Excuse me, internet!

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.240
That's right, that old catchphrase,

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:23.240
Excuse me, princess coin from the Legend of Zelda cartoons,

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.240
which used to run as the Friday special on the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:32.240
And if you're kind of younger, you probably don't remember this,

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.240
unless you've kind of seen it in a nostalgia post or whatever.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.240
But I certainly remember this from when I was younger.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.240
I bet a lot of our listeners remember this.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.240
Because I think I was around like 10.

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.240
So a lot of our listeners, you know, 5, 6, probably, or 10.

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:45.240
Yeah, they would have the Zelda cartoon on Fridays.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:48.240
Because the rest of the week was Mario cartoons, but Friday was Zelda cartoons.

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:51.240
Well, those came out on DVD a while back, and if you bought those,

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:54.240
well, it sucks to be you because they're all free on Hulu now.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.240
So if you want to see these cartoons and what they're all about,

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.240
if you just want to see the LOLs that is this,

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:05.240
although I will say this, this was definitely a step above the Philips CDI cutscenes.

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.240
Those were just... wow.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.240
It's like I drew in paint.

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.240
I know.

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.240
Those were wow.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:18.240
Those are not available on Hulu, but the Zelda stuff is now on Hulu,

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.240
if you want to relive your youth or have another youth.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.240
I don't know.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:28.240
Anyhow, also in tonight's rapid-fire news,

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:35.240
apparently Tex Murphy is a guy who is in this series of vintage adventure games.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.240
So if you remember those old-school games like, I don't know,

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:41.240
I don't want to say like Loom, but I'm thinking of the stuff like Deja Vu,

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.240
maybe Shadow Gate type of stuff, I don't know, on the PC,

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.240
King's Quest, throw in a little of that.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.240
If those sound fun to you, you can get new games in the series,

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.240
Mean Streets and Martian Memorandum.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.240
They're kind of throwback games to that era,

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:57.240
but I notice they mix in photography and a little bit of new stuff.

01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:02.240
You can all get these free. GOG.com is the place to get these games.

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.240
Good ol' games.

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:07.240
It's a holiday gift from right now until December 24th.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.240
Completely off topic, Rob.

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.240
I thought you said fartography.

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.240
That would be something completely different.

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.240
The way that you said it, I thought you said fartography.

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:15.240
I can't speak tonight. I don't know what it is.

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.240
I've botched so many words on the night show.

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.240
Rob can speak good.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.240
I might need to see a doctor.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.240
All right, anyhow.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.240
Thark Sockra, do you have some rapid-fire news for us?

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.240
I guess I do, Rob.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:29.240
Well, don't make me twist your arm or nothing.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.240
You didn't bring us cupcakes, by the way.

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.240
Well, boo-hoo, I'm sorry.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:39.240
At any rate, how about some more stuff for the iPhone?

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:46.240
There is Need for Speed Shift coming out for iPhone for $9.99.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:52.240
20 cars, 18 tracks, tilt functionality, which means lack of functionality.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.240
And you can play over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.240
That's pretty cool.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.240
Although I'm kind of a little uncomfortable to imagine what it might look like.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.240
But hey, it could come out really good.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:11.240
Also, in other iPhone and racing game-related news, we have a new Ridge Racer.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:19.240
We have Ridge Racer Accelerated, which will be on iPhone for $2.99.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:25.240
So I totally actually really dug the last Ridge Racer that came out on iPhone,

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.240
even though I didn't play it too long because I did get a little pissed off.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:31.240
So give it a go. Let us know what you think.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:38.240
Also, one other thing, and this has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with Rock Band,

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:41.240
because it's about Rock Band.

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:49.240
The holiday lineup for Rock Band Weekly is going to be Weezer.

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:55.240
We also have Songs from Limp Bizkit, the Offspring and Yellow card.

01:32:55.240 --> 01:33:01.240
And don't forget, Rock Band Unplugged download content is on hiatus.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:05.240
So here's what we're looking at for the Weezer pack.

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:11.240
We have Beverly Hills, Let It All Hang Out, and If You're Wondering If I Want You To, I Want You To.

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:16.240
And then Limp Bizkit, Build A Bridge, The Offspring, A Lot Like Me, and Yellow Card Ocean Avenue.

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:19.240
The latter three will be 160 points.

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:24.240
The pack for Weezer is 440, or 160 for each, again.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:29.240
And they are also available for Lego Rock Band.

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.240
The end!

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:37.240
I was going to say that Riddhiers is pretty awesome to be coming to the iPhone, but it's no daytona.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:42.240
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo!

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.240
Moving right along into other topics tonight.

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:51.240
Hey, how about some Twitter topics?

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:57.240
Every week we request your ideas and suggestions for topics over Twitter.

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.240
And we like to read some of those right now.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.240
First, I gotta make sure, because I wasn't here earlier tonight,

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:03.240
I gotta make sure some of these things don't duplicate things we're about to talk about later in the show,

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.240
because that would be a little bit embarrassing.

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:12.240
But TigerCaw305 sent us this article about gamers attempt to catch every Pokemon in 72 hours for charity.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.240
That's right, some very bored gamers have, no, it's for charity, you can't say that.

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:20.240
But some gamers have decided to catch every Pokemon in existence.

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.240
493 of them, to be exact.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.240
In 72 hours!

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.240
It's all for charity.

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:30.240
It's actually not for child's play, as a lot of these recent marathons have been for, which is obviously a great charity.

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:32.240
This is for a different one, it's called Allie's House.

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.240
It's an Oklahoma-based children's cancer foundation that provides support for families with medical expenses,

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:40.240
short-term housing, and other types of needs.

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.240
You can donate to the website.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240
The SpeedyGamers are the guys that are doing this.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:49.240
I want a charity that involves killing Sims.

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:52.240
There might be an idea for a marathon there.

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:56.240
Put up a proposal, Loki, and bring it to the show, we might do this.

01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:03.240
TigerCaw also sent us a quick link to an article that Blizzard will definitely work on a console game at some point.

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:08.240
So, in other words, not Starcraft Ghost, but like, for real this time, some type of console game.

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.240
Well, really, I think the title of this says it all.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:16.240
You know, they've done so many great PC games, maybe it's about time for them to do a console game.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:20.240
And they just wanted to clarify, I don't see the PC market as being bad.

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.240
We didn't have 12 million players 10 years ago.

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:26.240
Whatever the format, console or PC, I think if there's a good game, it's going to be played.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.240
We're working on PC because it's familiar to us.

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:33.240
Console, we have to worry about those unfamiliar things.

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:39.240
Also coming to us from Twitter, from Deathwishing, three questions from Deathwishing.

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:42.240
Should I buy LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year?

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:46.240
Yes, if you like platformers like Mario Brothers, yes, yes, yes, I think it's a great game.

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.240
It was my game of the year, the year it came out.

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:55.240
Plus, you get the beta for ModNation Racers, so you've got to act quick because that just started on the 18th.

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.240
Socom Confrontation, I guess, is that a game?

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.240
Confrontation.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:03.240
Confrontation, he spelled it wrong then. Confrontation.

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.240
And did you guys try out Dante's Inferno?

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.240
I did not try out Dante's Inferno.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.240
I downloaded the demo, I haven't played it yet because I was gone all weekend.

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.240
I've heard it's pretty terrible.

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.240
I've already played God of War, thank you.

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:16.240
Have you checked out the demo?

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.240
No, I haven't.

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:19.240
I've heard it's pretty bad.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:24.240
But we'll see. Again, I don't like to base games purely off the demo.

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:26.240
It's got a level of...

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.240
Well, it's going to be good.

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.240
I'll probably play it.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.240
I'll tell you right now, there's no way it's going to be Bayonetta.

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:36.240
Oh, definitely not going to be Bayonetta.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.240
But if you're looking for a game like Dante's Inferno, it's probably dirt cheap right now.

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.240
I'd go for Conan the Barbarian.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.240
Or just Conan.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.240
Not Age of Conan.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.240
Age of Conan, but Conan that came out on consoles last year.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.240
Conan the Librarian.

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.240
Seriously, it's such a ripoff of God of War, but it's fun.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.240
And by now, it's probably like 20 bucks.

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.240
Less than 20 bucks.

01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.240
Fair enough. Good deal.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.240
Gamergirl sent us a tweet.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.240
What's your take on Final Fantasy 13? Good or not so good?

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:07.240
Couldn't tell you. Didn't import the game. Don't want to pay those types of fees when the game's coming out here in a few months.

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:09.240
It's like 100 bucks and it's in Japanese only.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.240
I can't justify doing that.

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.240
But the demo we played a few months ago and...

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:20.240
The demo was fun, but once again, you know, I played the demo a few times and I'm like, why did I buy this?

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.240
Whoops.

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.240
That's right.

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.240
But that wasn't anything about the game.

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.240
It was just, why did you spend so much money on a demo?

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.240
It's like, oh okay, I don't know what's really going on here.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:36.240
Let's see, look at some other tweets, a couple things of stuff that we did earlier in the show, and that is basically it.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.240
So thank you guys for your tweets.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.240
Again, we'll take some more next week.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:44.240
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us on Twitter.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:46.240
Meanwhile, back to some more news.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.240
Yes, Nintendo has some interesting things going on.

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:57.240
They've announced their new titles coming out in the first part of the year.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.240
2010, of course, they're going to launch their first Wii game.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:06.240
It's going to be Endless Ocean 2, the sequel to the Deep Sea Diving Sim.

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.240
I didn't really play a lot of the first one.

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:14.240
It was kind of neat, very pretty, but not something I really want to jump into for the next one.

01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.240
Some DS titles, of course.

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:26.240
The newest, I guess I wouldn't really call them brand new, but Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver, the kind of remix of Gold and Silver.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.240
And there's some other cool things.

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:33.240
WiiWare titles, including And Yet It Moves.

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.240
Of course, Super Meat Boy is kind of cool.

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:42.240
They also have some third-party stuff listed as well.

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.240
Nothing too stand out from Konami.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:51.240
For example, we've got Dance Dance Revolution, although I believe that's...

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.240
No, maybe that is a new title, Dance Dance Revolution.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.240
I've heard there is some controversy going on right now, because I think that list came out.

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:06.240
And right now, that brand new Dance Dance Revolution is only slated for PS3 and Xbox, and wasn't announced for Wii.

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.240
So it's kind of like, was this the announcement or what?

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.240
The other thing, too, with Dance Dance Revolution...

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:16.240
I could see it probably coming to the Wii, but I remember before, they were kind of lumping in all those games.

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.240
Before, at E3, as Dance Dance Revolution won, Dance Dance Revolution for the Wii ended up being hottest part, E3.

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:27.240
And then, same for the PlayStation 2, it ended up being X2, so...

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:31.240
It might not be entirely accurate, but that's alright.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:37.240
I have to say, as a long-time music game fan, and someone who's been critical of DDR over the past few years,

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:42.240
I am interested in the reboot game that they're doing on Xbox 360 and PS3, because it is a reboot.

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.240
Something I've been saying DDR has needed for about five years. We'll see.

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.240
DDR hasn't just needed a reboot, it's needed a resuscitation and a kick in the ass.

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:54.240
And we'll see if this is it, although I will say the expectations are very low.

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:58.240
So Konami doesn't have to do much to impress me, so we'll see.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:06.240
The other thing that's going to be coming out also for the DS is WarioWare DIY, which is pretty cool.

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:12.240
That's that WarioWare game where you actually create your own mini-games using tools provided in the game,

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:19.240
including all sorts of weird things and some perverted things I've seen before on different YouTubes.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.240
So that's going to be available as well in March.

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:30.240
And then finally, just in time for Valentine's Day, you're going to be getting pink and blue Wii remotes,

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:38.240
are going to be released as well, I believe just before Valentine's Day.

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:42.240
Yay, just as I always wanted a pink Wiimote.

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.240
Oh, well then remind me to get you one, Rob.

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:47.240
Yay, that's what I want for Christmas. Oh, damn, they're not out until February.

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.240
Well...

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.240
Maybe for my birthday.

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:52.240
Now if they put out a pink console, that might sell a little bit. I don't know.

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.240
Possibly.

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.240
So...

01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:57.240
Yeah.

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.240
Alright.

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:00.240
The blue one's actually kind of cute.

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.240
But remember, do you remember at E3 when they first showed the Wii?

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.240
Mm-hmm.

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.240
How there were the blue ones and the different colors?

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.240
Oh yeah, there were all the different colors, but they didn't need to do that because the system sold like fucking nuts anyway, so...

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.240
Five days.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:17.240
And the curse of the white system did not hurt it.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:22.240
Remember, because the, well, no, the Saturn...

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:25.240
Well, I don't know what it is. Alright.

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:28.240
The Saturn in Japan came out in white.

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.240
We got it over here in black. What happened?

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.240
Poop. Dead.

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:34.240
So, see, they learned. They learned.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.240
Alright.

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:40.240
Well, speaking of Nintendo, I want to get into this story real quick about some new trademarks that Nintendo has recently filed.

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.240
That's right.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:47.240
Could this mean that a sequel to the Wii is imminent because there is a trademark that has been discovered for the Z?

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:48.240
That's right.

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.240
It's better than Wii because it's further in the alphabet.

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:52.240
It's the Z.

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.240
That's Z-I-I has been trademarked.

01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.240
Now, of course, rumors run rampant.

01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:00.240
OMG, the Wii HD is the Z!

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:05.240
By the way, though, just so you know, Z actually was trademarked in 2006.

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:14.240
Also trademarked, the B, the C, the Wii, the YI, and the Z.

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:16.240
This Sesame Street...

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:19.240
I thought the Wii was oi.

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:22.240
Oi, oi, oi, like a punk rock system.

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.240
No, it's like...

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:26.240
It's for the hardcore gamer, the oi, oi.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.240
No, it's French.

01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:28.240
I see.

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:31.240
But, you know, also, though, keep in mind, it's like a...

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.240
You know, that totally made me think of Clue.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.240
What?

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.240
Wii Wii, madame?

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.240
No, I'm sorry.

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.240
How do I know this?

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:41.240
They neglected the V because that's the one...

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.240
The Chinese knockoff is called the V, isn't it?

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:44.240
Yeah.

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.240
Whoops, forgot that one.

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:51.240
And, most importantly, you forgot the P.

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.240
Where's the P?

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:54.240
In the toilet!

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.240
Ah!

01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:57.240
And they missed...

01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:58.240
Someone had to go there.

01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.240
Now, see what's funny?

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:00.240
Somebody in chat said they forgot Xii.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.240
Wasn't that the name of a game on PlayStation?

01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.240
I want to say.

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.240
No, that was 13.

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:10.240
Oh, so Xii was not taken by Xiiii was.

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.240
She, though...

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.240
That sounds familiar.

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.240
I don't know.

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:19.240
The Z thing, though, and, unfortunately, I don't have the ability to put that clip on,

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:24.240
you know, our stream right now, but Z reminds me of Charlie the Unicorn, the second one,

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:28.240
where they go and they meet Z and they start speaking Spanish to the Z.

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:30.240
I remember that.

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.240
And that would be totally appropriate for this, but...

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:39.240
Deathwishing in chat says, the Nintendo oi with oi circle pit, run and mosh your face

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.240
off.

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.240
See, it's for the hardcore gamer.

01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.240
That's exactly what it is.

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:46.240
We're going to do another story real quick here, but I wanted to introduce someone who

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.240
just walked into the studio tonight.

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:50.240
Say hello to Tiara.

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.240
Why, hello there.

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.240
How are you?

01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.240
I'm good, thank you.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:55.240
Thanks for joining us tonight.

01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:56.240
How have you been?

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.240
You're tardy.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.240
You know we start at 6 o'clock, right?

01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:59.240
Yeah, I know.

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:00.240
I went out on a date.

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:02.240
Wait, hold on, hold on.

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.240
Aren't you just visiting?

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:08.240
Yeah, I'm visiting Jamie and I went out on a date with not Jamie.

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:10.240
You're a very naughty girl.

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.240
Did you have fun?

01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:12.240
Yes, I did.

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.240
We saw The Blind Side, which I expected to hate, but apparently I like Sandra Bullock

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:18.240
when she's not in a funny movie.

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.240
Okay.

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.240
Because she's not funny.

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.240
There you go.

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.240
Fair enough.

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.240
She's not...

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:25.240
The Net was not very good either when she...

01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:29.240
Well, no, that was unintentionally funny, I think, is the point there.

01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:31.240
So how have you been?

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:35.240
I know you've been working on your blog and I see you posting away on the Twitters and

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:37.240
feel free to plug whatever, but what have you been up to lately?

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:42.240
Dude, I have played the hell out of Final Fantasy IV, the after years.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.240
That game is so awesome.

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.240
I never finished it.

01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:48.240
I feel bad because it was pretty badass, the parts that I played.

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:52.240
I played the opening chapter and I think I played a little bit of Rydia's side story,

01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:54.240
but lots and lots of side stories to beat in that game.

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.240
Yeah, I have to be honest.

01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:01.240
I didn't buy all of them, but I played through the opening chapter, which is the first three,

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:05.240
and then I played through part of Rydia's chapter before I drove up here.

01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:10.240
So I'm excited to go home and play that and have the Wii Fit tell me how fat I am because

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.240
it loves to do that.

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.240
I know.

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:16.240
It's always kind of a downer to get on Wii Fit and then you watch as your character goes

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.240
whoop.

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.240
It's like, oh.

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.240
But surely that hasn't happened for you.

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.240
You actually look like you've lost a little bit.

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:24.240
Oh, well thank you.

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.240
Wii Fit's been working for you.

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:26.240
Well, it's fun.

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.240
I'm a master of the hula hoop now.

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:30.240
If only in real life.

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.240
That was a good useful skill, but no.

01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.240
And you're still blogging, right?

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.240
You're still doing your comic book reviews and so forth, right?

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:44.240
Yeah, I still have my blog over at AvengersTower.com and Jamie blogs over there with me occasionally.

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:51.240
Yeah, and I'm also blogging over at EatsleepGeek.com, which is another fun geeky blog.

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:52.240
Cool.

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.240
Who runs that?

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:54.240
A bunch of geeks?

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:56.240
Yes, I would have to say so.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.240
It's not just a clever name.

01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.240
Very good.

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.240
So are we ever going to start now?

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:06.240
I've heard rumors that someday there might be a giggling girl comic book show of sorts.

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.240
Well, Jamie and I had talked about that.

01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:14.240
We had talked about doing kind of like a mini podcast for one of our weekly features for

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:21.240
my blog, but we never have time and of course I'm trying to graduate next year, so I'm taking

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.240
like eight classes in the semester.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.240
She's already got a show.

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:27.240
Quit trying to ninja the hosts.

01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:29.240
Quit trying to ninja them into your show.

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.240
I'm just kidding.

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:33.240
We're using that computer.

01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:38.240
No, I heard they're going to borrow the show computer to do a side project, so that's awesome.

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:41.240
I hope you guys are able to find the time, but certainly school is school.

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:42.240
Yes, indeed.

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.240
All right.

01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:48.240
If you ever need a guest who never reads comic books, I will totally come on and be like

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:52.240
the gay guy on the show that says witty things.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.240
I will totally book you for that.

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:55.240
Awesome.

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:58.240
In my comics, I don't know anything about that, but Wolverine is hot.

01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:59.240
Exactly.

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:01.240
I need you to call my manager, though.

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:02.240
Oh, okay.

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.240
I'll give you my card.

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:05.240
Don't call us.

01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:06.240
We'll call you.

01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.240
All right.

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:09.240
No, but feel free, please, to pipe in.

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:12.240
Unfortunately, we don't have a fourth mic in the studio because we're a little ghetto,

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:14.240
but if you want to say something, raise your hand.

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:15.240
A little ghetto?

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:18.240
Just reach your hand out and grab my mic, or grab Loki.

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.240
He's closest.

01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:20.240
All right.

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:23.240
Anyhow, moving on with some more gaming news, Dark Sakura.

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:27.240
Oh, for the record, and completely off topic, you know how you're wondering if there was

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.240
a game called Z?

01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:36.240
There was an alternate reality game that came out on the PS3 for PlayStation Home.

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.240
That's right.

01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:42.240
Also, Devil Dice was called Psy, which was spelled X-I.

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.240
So, we've had X-I, X-I-I, and X-I-I-I.

01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:46.240
We've had stuff.

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:50.240
Well, I would like to create X-I-I-I-I, patent pending.

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.240
Although, I guess that would really be...

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.240
What, 13?

01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:55.240
No, X-I-I-I-I, 14.

01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.240
So, should it be X-I-V?

01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:00.240
You shut your mouth!

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.240
La-la-la.

01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.240
Okay.

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:04.240
So, how about my story, huh?

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:05.240
How about your story?

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:07.240
Yeah, how about that?

01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.240
How about a particular rumor about a game I'm particularly looking forward to?

01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:18.240
For Super Street Fighter IV, the rumor is that they're getting ten new characters total.

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:31.240
There's actually something based off of a clip from the Thummie stream that's showing a different list on here.

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.240
So, let me see if I can't find...

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.240
Who else might be included on here?

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:46.240
Well, I know for a fact that they're getting a DJ in Feilong, and Adon, and...

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:47.240
Guy and Cody, right?

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.240
Guy and Cody, and...

01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:55.240
I don't think they've announced any new ones, but there's, like, placeholders here, right?

01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:08.240
Yeah, well, see, there's four here that are completely blank according to this, and I can actually link the clip to the chatroom if they want to look at it.

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.240
It definitely, I think, would be worth seeing.

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:15.240
But from what I can tell on here...

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.240
No, Dan, you can't talk to me right now.

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.240
Sorry.

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:23.240
What I can tell on here is that...

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:33.240
Yeah, I recognize just about everybody else on here, so I wouldn't think of who they could have put in unless they're adding in, like, Charlie, and Rolando, and maybe Hagar.

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:41.240
What's interesting is that the game, we were only supposed to be getting, like, six, I think, in an earlier review, or maybe it was seven or eight, but now it's up to ten.

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:43.240
Like, it's almost like they can't put this down.

01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:46.240
They can't get away from this project, which is, you know, it's a good thing.

01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:50.240
It means that they really love it, but that's a lot of new characters too.

01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:55.240
It's just these four empty slots on here, it makes me wonder, you know, what's going to go in.

01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:00.240
This has to be from some kind of beta or demo on here.

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:03.240
Clearly one is going to be for Yoda, and one is going to be for Darth Vader.

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:06.240
Obviously, this is the download content.

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:11.240
I think that it should have the Tatsunoko versus Capcom people thrown in.

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:18.240
Some folks in the chatroom, Leo Shen says it's Ibuki, Dudley, and Makoto from what I heard, and I know the Ibuki rumor has been all around the internet.

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:22.240
And then Bob Coffee says Hakan equals an Arab oil dude.

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.240
Ono talked about but hasn't been revealed yet.

01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:31.240
And I've heard that rumor too, that there was some type of, like, oil tycoon fighter in it as well.

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:35.240
Okay, Game Guru, is Charlie really dead or is he Jean Grey dead?

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:37.240
Answer that.

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:41.240
Maybe Street Fighter is like Heroes, where people die but they don't ever, like, die.

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.240
Maybe it's like Heroes where they get their brains eaten.

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:49.240
Or maybe it's like Heroes where it starts to suck by the third season, but then gets good again at the fourth season.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:54.240
And then I stopped watching it at the fourth season, but apparently, you know.

01:50:54.240 --> 01:51:00.240
Of course you realize all I know about Heroes is the brain eating, and the cheerleader is like Wolverine.

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:04.240
Look, I'm just saying, Street Fighter doesn't have Zachary Quinto, okay? That's all I'm saying.

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:06.240
That's all I'm saying. ZQ or GTFO.

01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:15.240
Maybe it's like that episode of Heroes where Spock accidentally blows up Romulus and Nero goes back in time to find him.

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:24.240
Perhaps. Actually, in an unrelated story that I don't think we covered yet, but did you hear about that, that ZQ actually announced this week at the Video Game Awards?

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:26.240
He's going to be doing the voice for Star Trek Online.

01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.240
Yes.

01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:32.240
I guess, like, doing the opening narration or whatever, and I'm just like, he can talk to me anytime he wants.

01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:35.240
But he will be doing a William Shatner impression.

01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:36.240
No.

01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:41.240
You know what, by the way, I have decided to get the Amazon one, because I want a Borg chick.

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:42.240
Okay, fair enough.

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.240
She wants a Borg chick.

01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:46.240
I want a really ugly, I want a really ugly Borg chick.

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.240
You want a Borg chick? What? No, I'm just kidding.

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:50.240
I haven't decided which version of the game I'm getting yet.

01:51:50.240 --> 01:52:02.240
All I know is that I kind of want to play like a sassy Vulcan, which I know is kind of a contradiction, but I think sometimes the only logic is sass.

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:08.240
Okay, I'm going to totally out myself as a super nerd, but I read the Star Trek novels.

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:09.240
Nerd!

01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:16.240
And in the novels, there's a half-Vulcan who totally rejects her Vulcan side and is kind of sassy.

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:19.240
So, yeah, you could be sassy.

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:23.240
I can't play MMOs and not be sassy. It's my thing.

01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:25.240
Remember, we have to make the O.L. Orient.

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:27.240
That's true, and I'll have one of those.

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:29.240
You have to be sassy in the pants.

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.240
I have to have a sassy Vulcan.

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:33.240
You have to be sassy in the pants.

01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:35.240
That's right. Absolutely.

01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:37.240
I started playing WoW again, Rob. Did you see that?

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:39.240
Sucker! How's it going?

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:45.240
It's going good. My priest is almost 43. I've been using that dungeon finder thing.

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:48.240
And Jamie's on the phone with Dan.

01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:50.240
That must be important.

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.240
The dungeon finder's great, though.

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:58.240
Oh, yeah. I leveled from 37 to 42 in two days just doing that. So nice.

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.240
It wasn't important.

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:04.240
I'm also getting Star Trek Online, obviously, because I'm a big, huge nerd.

01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:06.240
Final Fantasy XIV we talked about earlier in the show.

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:08.240
Eh, eh, eh. What?

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:12.240
Probably not.

01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.240
All right. Fair enough.

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:15.240
Some comments in chat about the sassy Vulcan.

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:21.240
Salacious Pop says, instead of saying, that's not logical, she says, so ignorant.

01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:23.240
So ignorant.

01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:28.240
SSG 100 Matt says, Rob's character, live long and prosper, bitch.

01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:31.240
That's a good one. I like that.

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:33.240
We'll see what happens there.

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:37.240
Also, Tigerclaw's letting me know some specifics on that.

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:40.240
Apparently, he's also doing the voice of the emergency medical hologram.

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:42.240
Although, I gotta say, come on.

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.240
The guy who did it, what was his name?

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:50.240
The emergency hologram program, Robert Picardo or whatever his name was in Voyager.

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:54.240
When you think emergency medical program, I always think of him.

01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:57.240
Remember how they got him a cameo in First Contact?

01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.240
We watched some of that last night.

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.240
Did you really? I was watching through your window.

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:07.240
I wanted to be at your slumber party, but I couldn't and I was jealous.

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:10.240
What was it you were saying? We were going for the whole revenge theme?

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:12.240
Because we watched Wrath of Khan before that?

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:16.240
We watched Wrath of Khan and then she said, I wanted to watch good Star Trek movies,

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:19.240
but she tried to put in Star Trek 3.

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:21.240
I like Star Trek 3.

01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:23.240
I actually like that one.

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:26.240
Dan lost my copy.

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.240
Anyhow, sorry, let's get into some other gaming news.

01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:31.240
Just a couple quick articles. We're going to get to the mail back here very soon. Loki.

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:39.240
Yes, Nintendo has trademarked what is going to be about equally retarded as the Wii Vitality Sensor.

01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:42.240
Wii Relax.

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.240
Yes, it's a game about relaxing.

01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:51.240
It involves you putting on a Vitality Sensor so that you can relax.

01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:54.240
Relax or die.

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:59.240
Actually, wasn't there a mode? I think it's in Wii Fit.

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.240
One of the games, I think it's one of the last things you unlock is a

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:07.240
sit on the balance board as still as you possibly can.

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:10.240
If your fat ass moves too much, you're going to blow out the candle.

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:13.240
It's like a relaxed mini-game or something.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:14.240
I seem to remember.

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:18.240
Now you're telling me that don't move your ass is turning into a full game?

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:24.240
Isn't that kind of counter-intuitive with the whole Wii Fit?

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:28.240
Am I supposed to be moving?

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:33.240
Well, no. The only thing I've ever known, like any type of exercise thing I've ever done

01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:38.240
where you have to keep perfectly still is doing isolation exercises.

01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:40.240
Other than that, I don't know.

01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:45.240
I'm grabbing at straws here. I'm trying to find some logic in this.

01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:48.240
I don't know. Hopefully the game is going to say, you know,

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:52.240
relax, but don't touch yourself.

01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:54.240
No wanking.

01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.240
Wait a second. Game's going to be like, please put it on your finger.

01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:02.240
Wait a second. That is not your finger.

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:04.240
Stop that. That is dirty.

01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:09.240
Please do not be fapping.

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.240
It'll be like Miss Nude World 96 where if it detects something bad going on,

01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:17.240
then the image flips to the devil picture.

01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.240
Honestly, like a whole two people have probably ever played that game in MAME

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:23.240
and get that reference, but Loki's raising his hand.

01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:26.240
Somebody out there will understand what I'm talking about, and it's quite funny.

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.240
I promise.

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.240
Anyhow.

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.240
Other things.

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:34.240
I like how they show this girl in the picture that they picked.

01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:38.240
She looks like either a mannequin or a corpse.

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:41.240
Can't get more relaxed than a corpse.

01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:46.240
I can just see it now. Person dies while playing Wii Relax, and the game never knew.

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:48.240
High score.

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:52.240
World Record and Wii Relax.

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.240
Anyhow, that's terrible.

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.240
Hey, we should do that. We should try to go for the World Record.

01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.240
And Wii Relax? No, then we'll die.

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:05.240
That's the only way you're going to get the World Record is to die while playing Wii Relax.

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:07.240
It's worth it.

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.240
No.

01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:11.240
I like the whole living thing.

01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:16.240
I like this idea better. How about we go kill a million freaking zombies?

01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:19.240
That would be super awesome. That always makes a good game.

01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:22.240
Hence why Left 4 Dead is so freaking amazing.

01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:28.240
Apparently, what's going on here is that they're going to get characters from the original Left 4 Dead

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:33.240
to now hang out with the new characters.

01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:37.240
So apparently the old characters and the new characters from Left 4 Dead 2

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:42.240
will meet in a game called The Passing, or a download content piece.

01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:45.240
It's called The Most Important Campaign in the Left 4 Dead Story.

01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:48.240
All the survivors are being called together in one campaign.

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:51.240
That's from the Valve VP of Marketing, Doug Lombardi.

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:54.240
That's going to come out in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PC.

01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:00.240
It's going to have a co-op campaign in rural Georgia and a cooperative challenge mode of play.

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.240
There will be survival versus a scavenge mode.

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:08.240
If you play as the Left 4 Dead 2 cast, you get a new melee weapon, firearm, and uncommon common zombie.

01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:12.240
That's kind of interesting that they are going to bring the two worlds together.

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:15.240
But kind of cool. I bet fans of the series are going to be very excited about that.

01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:19.240
I wonder if that also means that maybe there's going to be an eight player type of mode now.

01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:22.240
That sounds like it could be pretty awesome.

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:24.240
So there you go.

01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:26.240
Coming soon.

01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:28.240
Coming to you right now is the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:31.240
It's the part of the show every week where we take some emails and read them for you.

01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:33.240
Live on air.

01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:37.240
So Dark Sakura, please open up the meal bag.

01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:40.240
What? I can't talk tonight.

01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:43.240
I'm broken. I need to be fixed.

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:45.240
Not in that way.

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:47.240
I need to wee relax.

01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:49.240
You need to get us cupcakes.

01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:51.240
I do not need a god damn cupcake.

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:54.240
You need to get us cupcakes.

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:56.240
How's that going to help me?

01:58:56.240 --> 01:59:00.240
You'll be doing a good deed and it will make you feel better in your heart.

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:05.240
Isn't wee relax thinking about baseball anyways?

01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:08.240
Wee relax is mean...

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:10.240
Think about it.

01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:15.240
And it makes your wee relax.

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.240
They should do wee irritate.

01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:19.240
Mailbag!

01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:24.240
Well this is sort of a mass email so I'm going to go ahead and read it.

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.240
I have a question.

01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.240
If a kid has the money to get a console but no games,

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:31.240
should the parent get the games for that console?

01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:33.240
For me, it is an Xbox 360.

01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:35.240
I can only survive on demos for so long.

01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:37.240
Sincerely, DS Master 26.

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:41.240
P.S. This is typed on a wee with wee mode and I'm visually impaired and lawsuits are a disgrace.

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.240
Shame on him.

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:48.240
Okay. McDonald's is an equal opportunity employer.

01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:51.240
You can get a job and save up and buy yourself some games.

01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:54.240
Parents don't have to buy you shit.

01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:59.240
Parents might reward you with games or consoles or what have you

01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:01.240
if you've been a good little boy and or girl

02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:04.240
and you do chores around the house and what have you.

02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:09.240
Or maybe you're in a household where you're fortunate enough to be spoiled to your heart's content

02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:11.240
like maybe Paris Hilton was when she was growing up.

02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:14.240
Unfortunately, that's not the way most of us have it.

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:19.240
So parents don't have to buy anything at all.

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:22.240
In fact, keep in mind in this economy of people losing their jobs and stuff,

02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:26.240
some parents can't afford to buy games at all.

02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:32.240
So you might be lucky to be getting a variety puzzle book from Penny Press.

02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:38.240
If you've got a Wii and an Xbox 360, you can sell one of them to get games for the other.

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:46.240
The reason I can get away with having all of these systems is because, well, until I hurt my hand,

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:48.240
I had enough money to buy them.

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:54.240
In certain states, if you're like 14, you can get a work permit and go work at certain places.

02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:58.240
And you know what? It's not a bad idea because work experience goes a long way.

02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:02.240
I mean, you might not want to work, but if you want a really cushy job in the future,

02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:06.240
working the crap jobs now help get you there faster.

02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:07.240
Moulins.

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.240
So just something to think about.

02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:11.240
Moulins unless you have lethal allergies.

02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:13.240
So, yeah, you'll find something.

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:19.240
If you were skilled enough to type this email on a Wii or whatever,

02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:21.240
you probably can help old ladies and old men set up.

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:23.240
It just says visually impaired.

02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:27.240
Still, you can probably help old ladies and old men get their computers set up or something.

02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:30.240
I bet there's a lot of things that you probably can still do.

02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:32.240
Yeah, you just have to look around for it.

02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:37.240
And on top of that, it's not like you can't start a change jar.

02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:43.240
But maybe your parents don't want you to get a job at 14, and that's their prerogative.

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:46.240
You know, my parents didn't want me to have a job that young because they wanted me to focus on studying.

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:50.240
So maybe try to work something out with your parents.

02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:51.240
You get an allowance?

02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:53.240
I want this game. How can I get this game?

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:58.240
Can I get a job? Can I do chores around the house? Can I get good grades?

02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:01.240
That's not something I got the answer to.

02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.240
Your parents will raise you however they want and or can.

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:13.240
Or, you know, and certainly in other cases, you know, when I say parents, I mean whoever is caring for you right now.

02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:14.240
Legal guardian.

02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:17.240
Your guardians, et cetera, et cetera, just because there's many different types of families out there.

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.240
I just want to point that out.

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:20.240
Okay. The last one is big.

02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:22.240
Ah, long email.

02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:28.240
Okay, hey, OLR crew, since I probably can't make it to tonight's episode due to finals and such, ooh, I'm sorry,

02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:31.240
I thought I'd email my review of the game I'd like to share with everyone.

02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:37.240
Mushihime-sama Futari, a 2D bullet hell shooter from awesome folks at Cave.

02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:44.240
For those who haven't been caught up on the recent shmup news, the recent Xbox 360 port of Futari is region-free.

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:48.240
Having heard this news, I preordered my copy and received it within a week and a half of it shipping out.

02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:50.240
So far, the game is mind-blowing.

02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:55.240
After having played Touhou for a few months, Futari is especially pretty in comparison.

02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:58.240
The games are very nicely detailed and vivid.

02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:03.240
Although there is slowdown, it's implemented on purpose in order to make the game easier at times.

02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:08.240
As far as play options and modes go, Futari offers a wide variety of them.

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.240
You can customize the game's display to your liking from the rotation of the screen,

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:15.240
for those dedicated enough to rotate their TVs for vertical shooters,

02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:19.240
to more intricate details like display filters and scan lines.

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:24.240
The main mode, version 1.5, offers three difficulty levels from the arcade, original, fairly simple gameplay,

02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:28.240
maniac, more difficult bullet patterns and an engaging scoring system,

02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:34.240
and the infamous ultra difficulty, home of the final boss that is featured in many a YouTube video.

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:38.240
Then there's a range mode, a unique and complex twist on the regular gameplay,

02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:45.240
with the ability to switch characters as well as slow down bullets close to you and reflect them back to crank out tons of points.

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:49.240
And if you're looking for stress relief or are bad at shooters, there's the novice mode,

02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:53.240
a glorified easy mode that offers the easy versions of original, maniac, and ultra.

02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:56.240
I tried novice ultra, and the bullet patterns are dense enough that you go,

02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:03.240
ah, wow, but they have very sensible gaps so you can enjoy the pretty bullet patterns without having to struggle to avoid them.

02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:08.240
I beat this mode on one credit on my first try, and I still found it to be a very fun experience.

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:11.240
Overall, I really like this game. It's worth the $70 I paid for it,

02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:16.240
and yes, I just said that a non-multi-hour game is worth $70.

02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:18.240
Holy shit, I just committed a capital offense.

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:23.240
Every time I do a session of futari, I come across something new that just amazes me,

02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:29.240
whether it's a new scoring trick, a new way to dodge bullet barrages, or a game mechanic I wasn't fully aware of.

02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:34.240
Arrangement, for instance, took me two playthroughs of this rather fun mode to get to grips with its mechanics.

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:37.240
My one complaint so far is the pricing of the expansion pack.

02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:45.240
The Mushihime Futari Black Label offers revised original and maniac modes as well as a new god mode that is like ultra mode,

02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:48.240
but with somewhat less retardedness. Is that a word?

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.240
And new shot types.

02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:55.240
While I like Black Label, I question whether it's worth the 1200 Microsoft points,

02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:59.240
especially since I can get Raiden Fighter's Aces 3 games in one for $5 more,

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:04.240
or one of a handful of standalone shmups for anywhere between $5 to $10.

02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:08.240
If you're a dedicated bullet hell fan or have an Xbox 360 of any region lying around,

02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:11.240
you owe it to yourself to snap up a copy of Futari for $360.

02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:16.240
I mean, hey, 70 bucks? At least you're not paying triple digits for the arcade hardware.

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:18.240
And that's from Ray Ayanami slash GS68.

02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:23.240
PS, this email is brought to you by San Jose State University, home of the never-ending for low days.

02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:25.240
It's on the list of things to play.

02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:31.240
The next one on my list other than Bayonetta for my Japanese region system was Ootomedia is Gorgeous

02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:33.240
was the next one I wanted to play.

02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:39.240
Then, of course, the one he mentioned was third on the list.

02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:46.240
That's so interesting, though, that it would actually put a mode in there for you to, like, turn the TV around.

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:47.240
Do those people do that?

02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:52.240
No, we actually bought a monitor, and it turned out that the monitor wasn't the right type.

02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:55.240
We bought an EGA monitor by accident, but it had a rotation.

02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:58.240
In fact, Dan's monitor here rotates.

02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:03.240
So he's actually pulled out the monitor and rotated it to play shmups,

02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:08.240
because I think he got, like, Raiden and Raiden 2 to run on MAME.

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:11.240
So, yeah, he's... it works.

02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:13.240
Hmm.

02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:16.240
All right, well, thank you for the review. We appreciate it.

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:18.240
And, of course, you can always send in your own game review if you want to.

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:21.240
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send emails.

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:22.240
Was that it for emails tonight?

02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:23.240
It was indeed.

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:24.240
Well, then, there you go.

02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:26.240
So let's move on to some more stories.

02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:31.240
Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:32.240
But not just yet.

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:35.240
For now, let's do some last few stories here.

02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:38.240
Well, before we do stories, though...

02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:41.240
Oh! Gosh, that's right, we have to get to the angst.

02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:43.240
Well, not now, because DarkSaga just ran to use the potty.

02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:44.240
So we'll do the stories in the angst.

02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:46.240
She went through a different type of angst.

02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:47.240
Yes.

02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:53.240
Anyways, there's a rumor that NHL 2K11 may be cancelled.

02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:58.240
And maybe 2K Sports is in some sort of financial trouble.

02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:08.240
This is coming from the recently released Take-Two's Q4 fiscal 2009 results.

02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:13.240
There's a section of games that the publisher is currently planning to ship in 2010.

02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:20.240
Both MLB 2K10 and NBA 2K11 are listed on the report, although I would think it's...

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:22.240
I can't remember if it's 2K9.

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:23.240
Yeah, I guess that's right there.

02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:24.240
You're behind or whatever.

02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:33.240
Anyways, and of course, that NHL 2K11 is not on the list.

02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:34.240
It's interesting.

02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:43.240
It says, we are currently in the process of evaluating our sports portfolio and have not announced any new NHL titles at this time.

02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:48.240
And that's a pretty damning statement, they put it.

02:07:48.240 --> 02:08:00.240
And also seeing that if NHL 2K is no more, the franchise appears to be dying the same death as College Hoops 2K series.

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:07.240
So they're kind of slim-lining their portfolio as far as their sports games.

02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:15.240
And honestly, I'm kind of surprised with the NHL stuff because I always thought that NHL 2K did a lot better than the NHL...

02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:22.240
EA's NHL games, and I think it was a better put-together game.

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:31.240
At least my friend at work who's really huge in the hockey used to pick up the 2K series quite often, and he seemed to like it a lot better.

02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:33.240
But, eh, who knows?

02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:51.240
And of course, they're wondering that maybe 2K Sports as a publisher might be in some trouble as well, seeing as MLB 2K apparently didn't do that well last year, or I should say earlier this year.

02:08:51.240 --> 02:09:03.240
Also, some of the EA games hockey stuff has done a lot better than NHL 2K, regardless of quality.

02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:16.240
And of course, since EA has the NFL license still, they can't even really make a football game, even though they did try with that All-American Football 2K or whatever that sucked.

02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:22.240
Well, I hope it's not that a series is going away, because that's going to leave very few hockey simulation games.

02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:28.240
So, you know, I always am a fan of more competition, that's for sure.

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:33.240
One other story for you guys before we get to the FUs of the Week and then the Skype line, and that has to do with Champions Online.

02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:40.240
And if you played and disliked Champion Online, which as I understand many of you did, maybe a giant teddy bear will change your mind.

02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:44.240
That's right, Mecha Teddy has made its way into Champions Online.

02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:49.240
It's called the Attack of the Misfit Toys, it's a seasonal event that's going on in Champions Online right now.

02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:53.240
And I guess it has a new villain called Black Harlequin is one villain in it.

02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:57.240
And there's also a villain that is just a giant mechanical teddy bear.

02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:02.240
So if you want to kill a big teddy bear, make your way to Champions Online right now.

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:03.240
That's awesome.

02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:07.240
I have to admit, that is kind of awesome, but I've heard the game was not anything to scream about.

02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:11.240
But sometimes MMOs have rough launches and then they get better as time goes on.

02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:15.240
I mean let's face it, how many times did Warcraft evolve, right?

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:18.240
I mean Warcraft didn't really get rolling until it was out for a couple of years.

02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:20.240
How long until Warcraft gets giant teddy bears?

02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:23.240
I don't know, who knows.

02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:25.240
Anyhow, there are no-

02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:27.240
What is Warcraft doing for their holiday event?

02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:31.240
They kind of do the same thing they do usually during the holiday events.

02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:32.240
There's random Santas all over the place.

02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:36.240
They call it the festival something, I don't remember.

02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:41.240
They have to give everything very generic holiday names because they're not taken from the real world.

02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:44.240
But they do holiday events pretty much the same every year.

02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:46.240
But sometimes they add new things like a new boss.

02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:49.240
Or this year they added the Thanksgiving event was brand new.

02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:51.240
So they kind of go back to the calendar and add new things.

02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:53.240
But they do holidays throughout the year.

02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:57.240
Anyhow, let's get to the FUs of the week because I missed doing it earlier.

02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:17.240
But I just wanted to talk about teddy bears. Can you blame me?

02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:20.240
You know what? I've had a really great weekend.

02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:30.240
So I can't really say FU to anything except maybe situations regarding a late paycheck and EDD.

02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:36.240
I've heard that California, I don't know about disability, but unemployment especially had some hurdles recently too.

02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:38.240
I don't know if that affected all ends of it.

02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:45.240
I'm actually more pissed off at EDD for not sending me certain paperwork that I needed to fill out three weeks ago.

02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:49.240
So I'm still waiting on three weeks of pay.

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:54.240
But starting next week though, I'm back to getting some of my regular checks.

02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:55.240
Woot.

02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:56.240
Loki.

02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:08.240
FU to people that think it's necessary to put inflatable holiday decorations out on their lawn and or house.

02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:11.240
Apparently it is just really prevalent this year.

02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:12.240
I mean, they're all over the fucking place.

02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:15.240
In fact, our neighbor's house across the street decided,

02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:20.240
Hey, you'll be a great idea. Let's put Frosty the snowman on our roof with some presents.

02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:23.240
It looks like a giant fucking snowman is attacking the house.

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:27.240
It is just retarded and people need to...

02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:29.240
Maybe that's the next champions online boss. Who knows?

02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:30.240
They need to cut it back.

02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:34.240
I mean, because they've got all sorts of inflatable things from, you know,

02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:40.240
giant snow globes to there's a guy in the corner that has Santa riding a Harley.

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:47.240
It's ridiculous. And I mean, it's just another thing that the holiday can barf onto your house

02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:51.240
because there's some people that have everything and they just keep adding every year.

02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:55.240
And oh my God, one house looks like they threw the lights just over the house and that's it.

02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:57.240
It's sad.

02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:01.240
I like Dark Sakura. Things are pretty good for me right now.

02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:03.240
So I don't have a lot of angst actually.

02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:07.240
But I will say FU to mob mentality, especially on the internets.

02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:09.240
God, some people are real sheep.

02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:12.240
Clearly I'm not talking about any of you, of course.

02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:13.240
Folks listening, what have you.

02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:17.240
It's just things I observe as I lurk on the internets.

02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.240
Well, I do also, though, think there should be an FU directed to that site too.

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:24.240
Oh yeah, of course. Well, that goes...

02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:26.240
God, they got 20 minutes of an FU earlier.

02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:28.240
I don't need to give them any more time.

02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:31.240
All right. And of course, how could we forget Tiara's here?

02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.240
Maybe she wants to get in on the angst tonight.

02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:39.240
I would like to say FU to people who deny the Holocaust.

02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:42.240
How can you do that?

02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:46.240
I know. I'm laughing because it's ridiculous.

02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:54.240
Well, a PE teacher in Las Vegas was suspended for telling students that the Holocaust didn't exist

02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:57.240
and that photographs were doctored, textbooks are inaccurate,

02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:00.240
and that the Nazis lacked the technology to kill so many people.

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:05.240
And I just hope they fire her. FU to that lady.

02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:09.240
Wow. Wow. That's all I can say is wow.

02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:11.240
I don't know. I kind of put...

02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:17.240
Well, that's really bad, but the whole 9-11 conspiracy theories, like...

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:20.240
Come on. Really?

02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:27.240
Well, first of all, in both situations you've got first person accounts from people who were there.

02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:30.240
You know, it's ridiculous.

02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:36.240
You know, I realize we have freedom of speech and all in this country, but good Lord.

02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.240
Use it appropriately.

02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:41.240
All right. Anyhow, we've got to get to the phones.

02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:44.240
We're actually going to start off tonight with a caller who should already be on the line.

02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:46.240
Caller, are you there?

02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:47.240
Yes, I'm here.

02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:49.240
Hi. Who is this?

02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:50.240
This is SSJ100 Matt.

02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:54.240
SSJ100 Matt, thank you so much for being on the show tonight. How are you doing?

02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:57.240
I'm doing very well and it sounds like you guys are doing well, too.

02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:59.240
Excellent. Yes, actually we're doing pretty good.

02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:03.240
When two of the three hosts have very little to rant about, it's usually a good night.

02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:07.240
But what's on your mind? What do we owe this phone call tonight?

02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:14.240
Well, as many people have been following, the Orange Land Revolution second mix is coming out this week.

02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:18.240
Yes, we talked about it at the top of the show, of course, but for those that tuned in late,

02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:25.240
it's like a fan project dedicated to the show, which low-key, myself and Dark Soccer, we didn't do shit for this project.

02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:26.240
We didn't do anything.

02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:34.240
Well, not directly. You guys created the shenanigans as the show and we kind of went with it.

02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:41.240
I would say I'm the lead developer, but you know what? This has all been a group effort.

02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:46.240
A lot of listeners have contributed and it took us two years,

02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:50.240
but I think we made a very great game.

02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:52.240
Well, tell us about some of the thank yous.

02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:59.240
Who are some of the people we need to give hugs and kisses to for making this game happen besides you?

02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:05.240
I would say the hardcore listeners. We have Act Def who worked on a couple songs.

02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:16.240
Dark Tetsuya, Misty, Breslul, who gave us the amazing announcer pack, and a lot of other people I can't even think of.

02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:24.240
Did you really have to put that guy song in there, though? Because I saw that YouTube and I was like, what is this?

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:29.240
It's already bad enough. I was actually listening to Understation Live, not this week, but last week,

02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:34.240
and I heard that thing, I don't know, it was a song from The Karate Kid or something,

02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:38.240
and then suddenly it just goes into, the best! The best! The best!

02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:45.240
And I'm like, what is this? Is this funny? I'm laughing because of how stupid it is.

02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:51.240
You know I love Breslul and he knows I love him, but there's clearly an inside joke here I'm not understanding,

02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:54.240
but I'm laughing because it's stupid funny like Showgirls.

02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:56.240
The inside joke is just John.

02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:58.240
I see, okay. Fair enough.

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:04.240
But, you know, we have a lot of things in there from, you know, back from your old days, from U.S.L.

02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:11.240
Oh God, oh man, you want to talk about embarrassing stuff? I'd rather the Like a Prayer stuff be released on, like,

02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:14.240
Entertainment Tonight than some of the old U.S.L. clips.

02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:18.240
Oh, well, we pretty much have everything that you've sung on there, so.

02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:20.240
Great.

02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:23.240
Contributed by a certain Mr. Donovan.

02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:29.240
Oh, love, oh great, I'm sure. Loki, be glad we didn't know you back then,

02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:33.240
because Travis had a way of getting you to make an ass out of yourself on the radio.

02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:34.240
I wouldn't have been.

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:38.240
God bless Travis Donovan, I would probably not be doing internet radio right now still if it were not for him.

02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:42.240
You still remember the number one way to make him upset was to drop the C-bomb.

02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:43.240
That's right!

02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:46.240
And you kept doing it.

02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:50.240
Because it was my favorite word at the time. But anyhow.

02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:55.240
Well, you know, Loki didn't get unscathed on this, so both of his performances are in the game.

02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:56.240
Thank God.

02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:59.240
This is why I don't do karaoke on the internet.

02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:03.240
Were you able to find anything embarrassing of Dark Sakura?

02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:08.240
Actually, no, we haven't been able to, you know, we have our archivers, but no one was able to find anything.

02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:11.240
Ask Travis for the apology song.

02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:13.240
No!

02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:14.240
That's all I'm going to say.

02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:18.240
No, no, no, actually that would piss me off.

02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:22.240
Beyond piss her off with laughter.

02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:26.240
I don't understand why we have to get the bad stuff, but...

02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:30.240
No, that's actually something that I'm still upset with him about, so...

02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:34.240
Then don't ask him about that. Ask him to hear it, just don't put it in the game.

02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:35.240
Alright.

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:45.240
But, you know, all the things that we put in, you know, we kind of made themed non-stop tracks of, you know, songs that you guys would enjoy.

02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:54.240
You know, we have a lot of songs from the Cage Match, we got a lot of songs that, you know, you, Jamie, and Matt like.

02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:57.240
So, you know, it's got pretty much everything in it.

02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:01.240
Just an all ABBA course for me, of course.

02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:08.240
Although we don't have a whole lot of ABBA in it, but, you know, we have, like, Skulk, we know you like that.

02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:09.240
Oh yeah, that's my favorite.

02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:18.240
We have Castlevania stuff for Jamie, we have a couple of Loki's remixes in there, so, you know, it's really got everything in it.

02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:24.240
And you know what, it doesn't just end here, we actually are planning on doing DLC for it, so...

02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:26.240
Oh my god, DLC, that's amazing.

02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:32.240
And of course this is all free, because it's kind of a rip-off of DDR in the first place, so you can't really charge for it.

02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:36.240
But if the listeners want to grab it, how can they get a copy of the game?

02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:42.240
Well, the game comes out on Christmas Eve, so this will be a nice Christmas present for all the OLAR fans.

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:50.240
And it will be up on the website, in the forums, so, you know, you'll be able to download it, spread it out, give it to everyone, to your heart's content.

02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:54.240
That's right, spread it like a badass TD, just go out there and tell all your friends.

02:19:54.240 --> 02:20:02.240
No, I, you know, and I truly think it's awesome that you guys have spent so much time on what some might view as a silly little project,

02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:12.240
but I kind of go, wow, the show, like, actually, people wanted to do that for our show, like, it's, I can't describe for you how neat that feels, so...

02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:21.240
But you know what, we couldn't have been able to do it without you guys, so, you know, if you guys didn't do the show, then, you know, we would have been just nerds hovering around a keyboard.

02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:27.240
I appreciate it. Maybe that'll be the name of the, you know, the next show in the future, because, you know, all good things must come to an end.

02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:34.240
OLR will end someday, I mean, it might be ten years from now, but, you know, it's gonna, someday, somebody's gonna wanna move or something.

02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:38.240
Maybe that'll be the next show, it'll be nerds sitting around a keyboard. We'll see.

02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:42.240
Maybe the comic book show needs a name, probably, unless you guys already thought of one, I don't know.

02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:47.240
So maybe, maybe, could say, maybe that one. Giggling girls sitting around a keyboard. And a comic book.

02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:54.240
Alright. Anyhow, SSG 100 Matt, is there anything else you want to say about the project, or anything else going on in your week that you want to tell us about?

02:20:54.240 --> 02:21:04.240
Um, nothing really. I mean, I've just been playing, uh, the new crack game that I have is Modern Warfare 2, and, you know, plenty of NHL.

02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:11.240
But, aside from that, you know, working on this game, so everyone can get it out on Christmas. So, aside from that.

02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:18.240
Alright. Well, thank you, once again, from all of us here at OLR, SSG 100 Matt, and everybody that worked on the project, all the folks you named, and so forth.

02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:27.240
Uh, it's a great tribute. As silly as it might be, especially to, I think, those that are going to download it that don't remember the heydays of OLR, and some of the crazy stuff we used to do.

02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:33.240
They're going to look at it and go, what? But, to us, we get it, and it's a great tribute, and thank you so much.

02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:35.240
Are there Iraqi suicide babies?

02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:39.240
That's an old joke. That's good.

02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:40.240
I can't, I can't say.

02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:49.240
Ah, might be the toasty thing that comes out, I don't know. Or, uh, what other, like, really, really old jokes do we have on the show? Like, I gotta go way back.

02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:50.240
Big Black Cock.

02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:51.240
Big Black Cock, that's old. Oh, man.

02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:53.240
The King of Iron Fingering.

02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:56.240
Oh, boy. Now, that's a good Embarrassing Jamie moment, just so you know.

02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:58.240
Yeah, but that was old, and I don't care anymore.

02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:02.240
Alright. She's over it now. Alright.

02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:11.240
But, yeah, definitely check out fans in the chat room, and everyone, check out the Orange Lines Revolution YouTube channel.

02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:18.240
We're posting up previews of everything, and eventually, you know, we'll post up everything that's on there, but, you know. Check it out now.

02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:31.240
Thank you so much, and just if you want a little taste, if I could, just real quick, I'm going to go to the YouTube channel real quick here, because I want to play, this is one of the songs that you could actually play in OLR Revolution.

02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:34.240
So, actually, some of these are, oh, they've added new stuff here.

02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:40.240
Oh, apparently, the Happy Sky Course has a Freeze Pop song in it, because I recognize that in the background.

02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:44.240
Let me see here, because I wanted to play that one song that made me go, what?

02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:48.240
Oh, God, they actually had the video of the Like a Prayer thing there.

02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:50.240
I hate you.

02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:52.240
Where was it? Here it is. Here it is.

02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:57.240
This is one of the great classics you could play in this game.

02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:06.240
I'm waiting for it to pop.

02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:19.240
So, it's like the Legend of Max, right, basically? Hold on, wait.

02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:30.240
Or this one, Gaianora Waternal, if it'll load. Here we go.

02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:48.240
Here we go.

02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:55.240
To someone who listens to Understation Live, that's funny. To the rest of us, we're like, what is that?

02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:58.240
But you all know John, so you know.

02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:01.240
I know. John needs to come back and visit.

02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:08.240
Although I have heard rumors, I have heard rumblings that the one and only Travis Donovan is considering a Sacramento visit.

02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:13.240
We may have Travis Donovan on this very program.

02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:18.240
And I could have sworn at one point he swore he would never come on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:23.240
But that might have changed. It's eight years now, and we may have him on the program.

02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:25.240
That would be, I can't even...

02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:27.240
That would be like DC and Marvel.

02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:35.240
Seriously, set your TiVo's now, kids. That's going to be an amazing show.

02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:39.240
Alright, ST-100 Matt, thank you so much for the call, and thank you again for all your hard work in this project.

02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:40.240
It's going to be a lot of fun.

02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:41.240
Thank you, guys.

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:42.240
Alright, take care.

02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:43.240
Yep, take care.

02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:44.240
I'd love that call.

02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:49.240
Thank you. No, thank you. No, no, no. Thank you. No, no, no, no. Thank you.

02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:54.240
Alright, anyhow, if you want to give us a call and say your thanks, or let us thank you for calling,

02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:56.240
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.

02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:58.240
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:03.240
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, so you can go ahead and give us a call right now.

02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:05.240
We're taking calls live.

02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:11.240
While we wait for some calls, since there is a little bit of a buffer between when we say things here in the studio and when you guys hear them on the feed,

02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:13.240
let's get some last-minute stories. Loki.

02:25:13.240 --> 02:25:20.240
The Sims 3 is releasing a tool to create your own worlds, so you can build your own towns in those said worlds,

02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:25.240
and that'll be released soon, although I don't see when.

02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:28.240
Alright, Russell, Russell, Thumble, Thumble.

02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:29.240
Hi, caller, are you there?

02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:30.240
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:31.240
Yes.

02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:32.240
Hi, who is this?

02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:33.240
It's Deathwishing.

02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:35.240
Hi, Deathwishing. What's on your mind?

02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:41.240
Well, first off, can I say an F you? Because I kind of feel like I probably should have said this instead of what I said.

02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:42.240
Okay.

02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:46.240
F you to the Modern Warfare 2 hackers. You ruined it for me.

02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:47.240
What did they do?

02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:57.240
This has been lately. I don't know if the patches addressed it yet, but they've actually made it where certain playlists and stuff will put you into hacked games and stuff.

02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:06.240
I really like the third-person playlists on it, and I'm now getting put into 18-player free-for-all with unlimited noob tube,

02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:12.240
unlimited ammo with noob tubes, and then when someone gets an AC-130, it's just rapid-fire.

02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:15.240
130 cannon shots.

02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:19.240
You know what? I support hacking and cracking your own game.

02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:31.240
If you want to go hack Modern Warfare so that you jump to the sun whenever you jump or that you have infinite rockets or whatever, go for it.

02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:37.240
But when you go and force that on other people in multiplayer to inflate your EP to make you feel better, that's just messed up.

02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:39.240
That's not what the rest of us are paying for.

02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:41.240
It just stinks.

02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:44.240
Hack it to your heart's content. Just don't go online with it.

02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:46.240
And I also got a PS3.

02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.240
Well, congratulations. Did you get any games for it?

02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:50.240
Not yet.

02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:54.240
Not yet? Are you thinking? Well, you sent us a tweet earlier.

02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:56.240
I rented Killzone 2.

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:57.240
And how was that?

02:26:57.240 --> 02:26:59.240
It's beautiful.

02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:06.240
Now, you were asking us about a lot of retail games, but have you thought about any of the download stuff that PlayStation Network offers?

02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:08.240
That princess was the first thing that came to mind.

02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:09.240
Really? Did you get it?

02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:11.240
No.

02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:12.240
Half the money.

02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:18.240
Oh, I see then. Well, maybe for Christmas you'll get some money or some PSN cards and you can talk about a new future show.

02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:22.240
And I found an old thing you guys didn't think about, an old joke.

02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:23.240
Okay.

02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:26.240
It's called the exclamation point.

02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:28.240
What?

02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:30.240
Fucked you exclamation points? You don't remember that?

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:32.240
The exclamation points?

02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:34.240
Yeah.

02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:36.240
You have to explain, no.

02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:39.240
It's hard to explain.

02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:41.240
Never mind.

02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:44.240
Hold on, where's our Price is Right losing horn?

02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:51.240
I think I just died a little bit.

02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:55.240
You don't even want to try and explain what this is? Because obviously you thought it was funny.

02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:00.240
I don't really want to explain because I've been up for 32 hours.

02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:03.240
What have you been up for 32 hours for?

02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:05.240
It was my party.

02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:13.240
Well, it's your party and you'll make a fail call to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to. So congratulations, this fail horn is for you.

02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:16.240
I want to kill myself.

02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:19.240
Oh, I want to kill myself.

02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:21.240
Don't kill yourself, just go to bed.

02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:26.240
Oh, and Allison, the best thing, it's a 4chan meme.

02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:31.240
Oh, God. Did I really just let that onto this program? Oh well, I suppose it was an endable at some point.

02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:32.240
Yes you did.

02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:34.240
Oh well, whatever.

02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:42.240
Where there is a dark corner of the internet to be hiding in, there lies 4chan. What do you know?

02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:45.240
And I hide there because I fail.

02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:47.240
Alright, well congratulations on failing.

02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:49.240
Alright, have a good night, Death Wishing, and happy birthday.

02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:51.240
The worst call ever, thank you.

02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:53.240
They want your cupcakes, by the way.

02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:55.240
Oh, yeah, I have 15 of them.

02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:56.240
Awesome, later.

02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:03.240
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. Try not to have a fail call.

02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:05.240
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:07.240
The best!

02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:09.240
No, okay, I'm done with that.

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:11.240
Did that really come from 4chan?

02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:15.240
I, okay, that whole thing, this is completely unrelated to why I'm calling.

02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:16.240
Okay.

02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:18.240
This is Breslau, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.

02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:19.240
Oh, hi Breslau, sorry.

02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:22.240
I would assume no listeners know that from the screechy voice we heard in...

02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:24.240
Guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy.

02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:25.240
Just kidding.

02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:27.240
I hate everybody.

02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:31.240
I was red in the face when you were playing that, so now everybody thinks of me as this moron.

02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:36.240
Well, good, now you know how I feel when I saw the Like A Prayer thing on YouTube.

02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:38.240
Okay, there we go.

02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:44.240
No, that came, okay, my roommate just kept saying the best of the best, like, to try to troll me.

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:46.240
I'm like, okay, seriously, what the hell is that from?

02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:51.240
So, she shows me the video, and I think it's hilarious, and I spam it all over the internet.

02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:54.240
So, and I got Travis good with it.

02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:55.240
I see.

02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:59.240
Any time I can troll my own co-host is a good day for me.

02:29:59.240 --> 02:30:00.240
Very good day for you.

02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:11.240
Now, I was actually calling, because we started a tradition two years ago on this very station.

02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:15.240
We called it March Madness, but now since we started in January, we just call it Madness.

02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:21.240
The best game of all time tournament, best 80 games of all time, square off in battle, and only one survives.

02:30:21.240 --> 02:30:28.240
Last year it was Super Mario Brothers 3, and I'm officially opening the vote for nominations.

02:30:28.240 --> 02:30:32.240
Ah, so nominations are kicking off tonight, even though it's not 2010 yet.

02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:36.240
Are you kicking off things a little early, DMN?

02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:42.240
Uh, yes, because I have so much, I'm going to have so much stress in January.

02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:44.240
I want to get it started now.

02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:47.240
Well, it's your schtick, you can do whatever the hell you want, DMN. You go.

02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:48.240
Yes.

02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:49.240
All right.

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:55.240
We're changing the voting around, so there could be, like, games like Rock Band and DDR,

02:30:55.240 --> 02:30:59.240
now, I know a lot of people who listen to the show are huge Be Monty fans, and that's nothing against them,

02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:07.240
but it's been a problem when DDR is seeded in the top 12, and Rock Band has seeded in the top five for consecutive years.

02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:14.240
So we're changing the formula a little bit to keep it a little bit more fair,

02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:17.240
so we don't see games like Rock Band get all the way to the final four,

02:31:17.240 --> 02:31:20.240
because a lot of people are like, this game doesn't really need to be here.

02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:24.240
What are you doing different?

02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:26.240
Or is it a top secret formula?

02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:27.240
It's a secret.

02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:32.240
I see. It's like the herbs and spices at KFC. It's going to forever remain top secret. All right.

02:31:32.240 --> 02:31:33.240
It's a secret to everybody.

02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:39.240
So go vote on something that you're not really sure how it works, but in the end, there will be a winner that will be picked.

02:31:39.240 --> 02:31:40.240
And pie?

02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:45.240
I have all the details of submitting your vote on orangeolensradio.com right now.

02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:46.240
Sweet.

02:31:46.240 --> 02:31:51.240
If there are any questions, they can also be directed to uslmadness at gmail.com.

02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:55.240
I'll be putting bracket details up probably in a couple of weeks.

02:31:55.240 --> 02:32:00.240
But votes are open now, so vote early, but don't vote often, because you can only vote once.

02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:02.240
I have a question.

02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:03.240
Yes?

02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:08.240
My question is, why don't we just call this whole thing over and Super Metroid wins, because that is what should happen.

02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:10.240
You know, I agree with you.

02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:12.240
Super Metroid is the greatest game of all time.

02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:18.240
I will tell you that both years, and I will even tell you this year, it will be my top vote.

02:32:18.240 --> 02:32:21.240
But when it gets beaten by crap like Tetris.

02:32:21.240 --> 02:32:26.240
Aw, well Tetris isn't crap, but it's just not Super Metroid.

02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:27.240
It's not Super Metroid.

02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:30.240
But I also had another reason I was calling in.

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:31.240
Oh, my.

02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:32.240
Not to promote anything.

02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:41.240
I actually, I have a beef with video game marketing, and since I finally called into the show and tuned in for the first time in like five months,

02:32:41.240 --> 02:32:44.240
my game of the year this year was Borderlands.

02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:46.240
Hands down.

02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:53.240
But this game didn't get a lot of press, because everyone's, you know, staining their pants about Modern Warfare 2.

02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:57.240
I'm going to be honest with you, Modern Warfare 2 is not the best game I've played.

02:32:57.240 --> 02:32:59.240
It is not the best game I've played this year.

02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:02.240
It is not the best game I've played in the past five years.

02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:04.240
Modern Warfare 2 is above average.

02:33:04.240 --> 02:33:06.240
It's a good game.

02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:08.240
But it's not this amazing thing people make it out to be.

02:33:08.240 --> 02:33:13.240
The reason why it was this great thing everyone made it out to be is marketing.

02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:19.240
I wish some of these games that were great got more marketing.

02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:28.240
If Borderlands got the marketing it deserved, I think it would have, it would have sold more, it would have got, people would have liked it more,

02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:34.240
and the game from what I noticed really got popular by a little bit of, a little bit of marketing and a little bit of word of mouth.

02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:40.240
But you see games like Katamari Damacy, Psychonauts, gosh, what was the other one I had?

02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:42.240
Okami would be a good example.

02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:45.240
These games get fantastic reviews.

02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:50.240
And unfortunately in these days that doesn't mean anything and it's depressing.

02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:52.240
You know what's weird though? Sometimes it does.

02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:58.240
Like I look at a game like Braid that really did everything based off of that word of mouth.

02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:03.240
But maybe that's the difference between download title and going to the store and drop $60 because you know.

02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:08.240
And one question I usually ask people when they tell me a game's good I say, well is it $60 good?

02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:11.240
Or is it, you know, a rental good?

02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:16.240
That stems from an old game on my show that Jimmy and I did on our old show way back.

02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:18.240
God I don't even want to remember.

02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:22.240
But we had a segment called Actual Retail Price where we would name games that were coming out

02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:25.240
and we would say what we would actually pay for them.

02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:28.240
And in some cases I'd pay more than $60 for a game.

02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:31.240
And in a lot of cases I'd maybe pay $40 for a game.

02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:35.240
Look at a game like World of Warcraft, I have paid more than $60 for that game.

02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:40.240
In fact I've paid more than I care to admit.

02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:43.240
But Modern Warfare 2 is not a $60 game.

02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:45.240
It was a $45 game.

02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:47.240
I hate to say it.

02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:56.240
But I needed to get that out because I'm sick, and Nintendo is so guilty of this.

02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:58.240
All I have to say is Wii Music.

02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:01.240
They marketed this as the greatest thing since sliced bread and it was crap.

02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:04.240
But that's all.

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:07.240
I'm done. It was good talking to you guys. Happy holidays.

02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:10.240
No, I appreciate it. It's a damn good point DMN.

02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:13.240
And I think something will also continue next week.

02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:16.240
Next week is going to be our last show of the year and the holidays will die down a little bit.

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:19.240
And we're going to get into some of these talks about not just the stuff of the year.

02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:22.240
In fact I kind of envision we haven't really sat down to talk about next week's show.

02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:28.240
But I sort of see that we're going to spend half of it talking about the year and half of it talking about the decade.

02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:33.240
And I think in this decade alone we've come to have to pay a lot more for our games.

02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:40.240
We're paying now $60 for games whereas at the beginning of the decade with the whole CD based thing we weren't paying so much before.

02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:45.240
I will say the first game I paid $60 for, Street Fighter II on the Super Nintendo.

02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:49.240
First game I paid $60 for was Killer Instinct on the Super Nintendo.

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:52.240
I do realize that cartridge based games did raise that expectation earlier.

02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:56.240
But CD was supposed to drop that and now it's come back up again. It's very interesting.

02:35:56.240 --> 02:36:01.240
We will talk about a little more of this next week as we start to kind of wrap up the year and the decade.

02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:03.240
Because it will be a slow news week. You know that.

02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:05.240
So more to come on that next week.

02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:08.240
But thank you so much GMN. We appreciate the call as always.

02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:10.240
And keep up the good work with Understadation Live.

02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:13.240
I wouldn't call it good work but we'll keep up the work.

02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:14.240
Keep up the fair work.

02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:15.240
Happy New Year guys.

02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:18.240
And hey if Travis does come out here you should come with him.

02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:21.240
I am planning on it. We're working on synchronizing our trips.

02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:25.240
We might have to just make it OLRCon. We'll rent a hall or something.

02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:29.240
We'll rent them a Sonic Lodge and just throw ourselves a party.

02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:31.240
Sounds good man.

02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:32.240
Take care.

02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:33.240
Alright take care. Bye bye.

02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:34.240
Later.

02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:36.240
That's going to do it for calls tonight. Sorry to those who didn't get through.

02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:38.240
But remember you can't always send us an email.

02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:41.240
Or you can always give us an offline call.

02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:45.240
Or you can always send us an email bag. Twitter. Whatever you want to do there.

02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:48.240
So sorry to those again who did not get through.

02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:50.240
Anyhow.

02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:52.240
It's about time for us to wrap up the show.

02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:55.240
But I know Loki might have had some more last minute stories he wants to get to.

02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:58.240
But he's too busy laughing over there at the freaking...

02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:00.240
Well I was laughing at some stuff.

02:37:00.240 --> 02:37:07.240
But I like how they have I'm on a Boat as one of the songs in there and they have the video for it.

02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:09.240
Nice.

02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:13.240
So other things we'll mention real quick.

02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:23.240
There's a game that was originally on the iPhone and the iPod Touch from a French independent developer called Press Start Studios.

02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:28.240
And it's a hack and slash game called Twin Blades The Reaping Vanguard.

02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:30.240
And it's a really awesome looking game.

02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:34.240
And it's now coming to Xbox Live Indie Games.

02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:39.240
And I think you should pick it up just because it's incredibly beautiful.

02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:41.240
It's all hand drawn.

02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:44.240
The game's coming out for three bucks.

02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:47.240
So definitely worth picking up.

02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:49.240
And it looks like a pretty fun little game.

02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:51.240
Maybe I'll have to look for the iPhone one.

02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:54.240
Yeah the iPhone one is actually already out now.

02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:58.240
And is actually out for 99 cents.

02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:03.240
This one will be coming out apparently on Christmas.

02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:05.240
So the 25th.

02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:07.240
Sounds kind of neat.

02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:14.240
Assassin's Creed 2 is getting some download content that's going to kind of bridge the gap between the first and second games.

02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:19.240
And they've added some new abilities including the spring jump.

02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:27.240
And that's apparently two different contents between I guess the end of January and the end of February.

02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:31.240
They're going to have the Battle of Forli.

02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:34.240
And that's going to be for $3.99.

02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:42.240
And also I guess the Bonfire of the Vanities which will run you $4.99.

02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:52.240
And I guess it's speculated that the two editions will fill in the missing sequence 12 and 13 from the game.

02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:54.240
So that's neat.

02:38:54.240 --> 02:39:00.240
And lastly the 3D Blu-ray specs have been finalized.

02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:06.240
And this is going to be kind of going forward I guess.

02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:09.240
I don't know if they're going to start this next year or what.

02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:14.240
But obviously the big trend in entertainment nowadays is 3D.

02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:18.240
And they're going to be kind of bringing that to you with Blu-ray.

02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:30.240
And one of the things that they did include with the Blu-ray specs is going to be that the 3D will be supported on PlayStation 3.

02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:35.240
So soon you'll be able to watch 3D movies on your PlayStation 3.

02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:44.240
Makes sense since they have similar technology right now available for the Avatar game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:48.240
Assuming you had the TV to support it and had the glasses to go with it.

02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:54.240
But actually some of those TVs because the Avatar game supported all sorts of different methods for it.

02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:56.240
One of which is Realty.

02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:59.240
And I didn't even realize that Realty is available for TVs.

02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:05.240
And those glasses are dirt cheap. I mean hell you go see a 3D movie in the theater.

02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:08.240
You get a free pair of those polarized glasses.

02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:10.240
Aren't you supposed to turn them into the bucket at the end so they can be steam washed?

02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:14.240
Fuck that. I'm paying extra money for the movie.

02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:16.240
I'm keeping those damn glasses.

02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:21.240
But yes, for Avatar I did recycle them. I did have some before just in case.

02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:22.240
Yeah I stole one when I saw it.

02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:24.240
A kid did have a pair from Disneyland that I accidentally held onto.

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:28.240
If I ever get a TV though that does support Realty, I'm keeping those damn glasses.

02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:32.240
Speaking of 3D and Disneyland, we gotta plan a trip in February y'all.

02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:34.240
Guess who's coming back?

02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:36.240
Oh my gosh, did you see Princess Tiana?

02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:39.240
I did. I was so excited to give her a hug.

02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:42.240
She let me pretend to be the prince even though the prince was standing right there.

02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:43.240
That's awesome.

02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:46.240
But my female friend that was with me, she posed with the prince so it worked out.

02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:48.240
You should have posed with the prince too.

02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:51.240
I should have but there were all these little kids around.

02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:56.240
I don't think the parents would appreciate those types of questions so we'll just leave it at that.

02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:04.240
But no, I obviously had a good time and I'm excited to go back next year because we've got to see Captain EO.

02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:06.240
It's gotta happen.

02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:09.240
Oh you guys, Captain EO is officially coming back in February.

02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:10.240
Okay we're going.

02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:13.240
Officially has been announced. Honey, I Shrunk the Audiences is out.

02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:19.240
And what's interesting, I actually asked one of the guys working there if there was any banners for the Captain EO announcement up.

02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:21.240
And he said no, it's just that they made it official.

02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:27.240
And I was like, well you know, as nice as Honey, I Shrunk the Audiences has been, it's kind of aged so you guys probably aren't surprised.

02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:30.240
And they were like, yeah we kind of knew it was leaving in a year anyway.

02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:34.240
And I was like, oh really? Something about that kind of caught my ear?

02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:37.240
Okay and this Captain EO thing has been announced for a limited run.

02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:40.240
What has already been planned for next?

02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:44.240
Because this means something has already been planned for 2011 for that theater.

02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:46.240
So Captain EO is going to be there but only for about a year.

02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:48.240
Then something else is coming.

02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:50.240
I have a theory. I have a theory.

02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:51.240
What is your theory?

02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:52.240
It's Tomorrowland, right?

02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:53.240
Yes.

02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:55.240
Pixar is a big thing right now.

02:41:55.240 --> 02:41:59.240
I'm going to guess it's a Wall-E movie would take that theater.

02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:01.240
And I think a Wall-E movie would be pretty rad.

02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:02.240
That would be awesome.

02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:05.240
That's my bet, is a Wall-E movie replaces Captain EO.

02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:10.240
If it was my way it'd be Tron and they'd reopen the monorail and actually make it a good Tron ride.

02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:13.240
The People Mover, OMG, yes please.

02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:16.240
So much this. So much this.

02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:21.240
If it wasn't for that stupid guy who decided to dive off the wrong side of it,

02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:26.240
we would still have us a People Mover and we would still have us the Tron thing which was the only good part about the People Mover.

02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:30.240
I will say that. I don't want to make this the Disney show but we're at the end of the show anyway.

02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:31.240
There's not a lot left.

02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:32.240
I will say this real quick.

02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:37.240
One thing I did see at Disneyland that just opened up Friday, reopened up I should say,

02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:39.240
all new, all completely redone.

02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:40.240
I was very impressed.

02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:42.240
Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln is back.

02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:43.240
You know, I have never seen that.

02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:45.240
It's actually pretty awesome.

02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:46.240
I gotta say.

02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:49.240
It'll get your patriotic senses tingling.

02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:51.240
Like, you know, it's very well done.

02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:55.240
The animatronics are the part of it that's amazing because Abraham Lincoln looks fucking real.

02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:58.240
And he stands up and sits down and all this stuff.

02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:01.240
It's like, oh my gosh, why isn't this level of animatronics?

02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:02.240
Let's pick a date and go.

02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:03.240
We're gonna have to do it.

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:06.240
Let's hope that's not Evil Lincoln who will murder us all.

02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:07.240
No, it's not Evil Lincoln.

02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:14.240
I especially love the part when President Lincoln stands up and does his rendition of Lady Gaga's poker face.

02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:18.240
Starts mimicking the bad romance video, yes.

02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:19.240
It really hit me.

02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:21.240
In the voice of Christopher Walken.

02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:23.240
Nice.

02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:26.240
All right, anyhow, there you go.

02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:28.240
That's my little snap Disney review.

02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:32.240
But they have water back at California Adventure.

02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:36.240
The main walkway at California Adventure is closed.

02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:37.240
You have to go all the way around to get anywhere.

02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:40.240
But California Adventure, I have a cry.

02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:45.240
But they really are getting that park ready for 2011.

02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:46.240
It's gonna be awesome.

02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:47.240
It's gonna be awesome.

02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:49.240
Aladdin is also closing.

02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:51.240
It's announced at the Aladdin show at California Adventure.

02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:52.240
It's gonna close in August.

02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:54.240
It's probably going to Broadway.

02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:55.240
Don't cry too much.

02:43:55.240 --> 02:43:57.240
It's in London's West End right now.

02:43:57.240 --> 02:43:59.240
Pam Anderson is playing the Genie.

02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:01.240
Which, what, but okay.

02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:04.240
But a Toy Story musical is gonna replace it.

02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:05.240
That's cool.

02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:06.240
Yeah, so we'll see.

02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:11.240
Well, you know, Toy Story 3 is in the works.

02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:13.240
So.

02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:17.240
Oh, I'll say about Toy Story 3, they're actually gonna be doing an IMAX releases for that.

02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:18.240
Oh yeah, the 3D.

02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:20.240
Yeah, they did the 3D preview before.

02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:21.240
So, good times.

02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:23.240
And, you know, again, how does this relate to video games?

02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:25.240
Movie, video game tie-ins, and the technology.

02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:27.240
Just like Logie's saying about Avatar.

02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:31.240
You know, this type of technology you're seeing in Avatar is already in the game.

02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:34.240
It's just that it's probably too expensive for a lot of you guys to afford.

02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:37.240
3D, we had Toy Story Midway Mania come out this year on the Wii.

02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:42.240
And although the game was not as good as the ride, the 3D is an option in it.

02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:46.240
You know, this is the wave of the future as this decade comes to a close.

02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:48.240
It's gonna be very interesting.

02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:53.240
Speaking of the decade coming to a close, you know next week is gonna be all about not just the year but the decade.

02:44:53.240 --> 02:44:55.240
Probably do a little bit of both.

02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:57.240
I'm not sure if we'll have any special guests yet.

02:44:57.240 --> 02:44:58.240
I'm gonna try to line up some folks.

02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:00.240
We'll see what happens over the next week.

02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:06.240
But we will be back live again on All Games Radio on the 27th with our last episode of the decade.

02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:11.240
If you can believe it, we've been doing this show most of the decade.

02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:13.240
That's kind of strange.

02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:16.240
Well, we've hit seven years.

02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:20.240
I know. Next year will be the eighth year of broadcasting.

02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:23.240
2002 to 2010 and beyond.

02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:25.240
We're bored.

02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:31.240
Anyhow, before we close up shop tonight, of course we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts here in studio.

02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:33.240
So, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:35.240
I want cupcakes.

02:45:35.240 --> 02:45:37.240
You guys and cupcakes.

02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:41.240
My final thought is at the grocery store there's a box that says Betty Crocker on it.

02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:43.240
It'll help you out.

02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:45.240
Loki, your final thought, please.

02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:49.240
I don't know.

02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:51.240
Tiare, your final thought, please.

02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:53.240
Thank you so much for being here tonight.

02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:55.240
I'm going to borrow that top.

02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:57.240
Betch. Wait, wait. You've got to see the back side.

02:45:57.240 --> 02:45:59.240
I'm wearing my Kelly shirt tonight. Don't be a betch.

02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:01.240
That's great.

02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:03.240
And, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:05.240
He just said he didn't know.

02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:07.240
I thought he had a real one.

02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:09.240
He started to say something.

02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:11.240
I don't really have anything.

02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:13.240
Okay, well then fine.

02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:15.240
That's it. We're going to close up shop.

02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:19.240
See you next week. We're going to do it all again on our 350th decade-end episode.

02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:21.240
Rob better bring cupcakes.

02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:25.240
