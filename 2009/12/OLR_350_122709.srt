00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, December 27th, 2009, Pac-Man might soon fight at Battle Royale.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Could your portable games soon be banned on airplanes?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We take a look back on the year and the decade in gaming.

We are live with our 350th episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December 27th, 2009.

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, we're here for the holidays.

We're an All Games Radio affiliate and we're very thankful that they let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to do our little program.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Joining you over the next few hours, myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only, Jamie Summers, DarkSakura.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Stupid thread isn't working.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How are you doing? Are you posting on the internet? Is that the type of thread you're talking about?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, I'm crocheting.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I see.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm being domestic, dammit. Who wants a hat?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Wow, that's a change.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who wants a hat?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Me? No.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You'll get a very tiny hat.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Say hello to... I'll put it on my thumb.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hello.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How you doing?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm alright.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Except we can't hear you at all. Is your mic on?

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, it is.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know why we're not hearing you at all tonight.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's the wonders of live radio, is that sometimes you get technical difficulties, things happen.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Sometimes people play with my volume, apparently.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Apparently. I don't know what's up with that.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I think what's going on is that behind our backs, DarkSakura's been secretly taping another show.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No! Not at all.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And he's been screwing with some of the audio settings.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I didn't touch Loki's. I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Try again, Loki. I think we'll hear you now.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alright.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now we hear you too much.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's really loud.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're good now.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How are you doing, Loki? How was your week?

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm alright.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Did you have a good holiday?

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, sure.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did Santa bring you lots of good stuff for the holidays?

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Pots and stuff to do yard work.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Dude, Santa brought you pot?

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, like pots and pans.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, I see.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Just in time for New Year's, Rob.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Amazing.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Alright, let's go around and talk about our gaming week. So we always start off the show talking about what we've been playing this week.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Wow.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I played some.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I downloaded Braid because it was really cheap for Insert Holiday Here.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I also picked up World of Goo, which I started and then stopped.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Because I was like, oh wait, I have to do some stuff.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I've got some new games that I just haven't played yet.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I also pre-ordered... I hate the word pre-order.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I just ordered my copy in advance of Star Trek Online.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And apparently if you do the order through Amazon, or through I guess any of the others, you'll get like a thing to do the beta.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Nice.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So I'm going to be in the beta.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When's the beta start? I can't remember. There's so many like...

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
January something... something teeth.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's like closed beta and open beta and retweet to get into the OMG Right Now betas.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Like there's so many betas going on. I feel like I'm in the 80s all over again.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And VHS is just around the corner.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's January something teeth.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I see. Alright, thank you. That's so helpful.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But I also got Dan picked up for me.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, by the way, it has to be the collector's edition.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, for you to get in the beta?

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
To get in the beta.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I see, okay.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Which is what I got.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Which is what I imagine a lot of people are getting anyway.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And Dan picked up for me the Silent Hill game on Wii, so I need people to come over and hold my hand while I play it.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You know, I watched a friend play that game a couple days ago, and it was very strange.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Like I saw the nightmare sequence happen, you know, and it's weird.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It doesn't get all like rusty. It's just like snowy in that game.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And it was just running through doors over and over, running through doors, running through doors, running through doors, trying to avoid zombies.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I was like, you don't really run. I mean, you do run in Silent Hill, but this felt like an action game or something.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It was strange when I watched. I didn't play it, I watched.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It shatters your memories of Silent Hill. How about that?

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Clearly.

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Clearly.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You have a bug about to crawl into your hair behind you.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Just saying.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Gross! Gross! Our studio's infested!

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It is not infested. Here's a tissue, you big baby.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There's bugs in our studio! Is that what you plan to end the decade with? Killer bugs, destroy the host?

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Rob, it probably snuck into the window. Don't kill it, you big baby.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hold on, I'm going to take a picture of it to show the listeners how big this scary bug is.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, fuck.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Make sure to zoom in.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Anything else for your gaming week, DarkSakura?

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I played the game where I laugh about Rob being a big baby.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Shut up, this is a big scary bug.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We also played some Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, which was really good.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When I upload this to the feed, it's going to look like a big poop on your curtain.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Just kill it already, Rob. Is it a pincher?

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to kill it. I don't know. If it pinches, I'm going to scream.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Here, give me the napkin. Hold my mic.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
DarkSakura saves the day.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I should just let it do its thing.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Not even.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's a scary bug.

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's a pincher, it's fine.

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But pinchers pinch. That's why they're called pinchers.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They're not called pinchers. They're called earwigs, I thought.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now that our show has been sufficiently derailed for the decade, Loki, how was your gaming week?

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It was alright. I didn't play a whole lot. I played more Grand Theft Auto this week, what level I could.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It went crunch.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then I brought my 360 home hoping to play more stuff, but I just didn't because I ended up messing around with other things.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So I played a little big planet of the new Pirates of the Caribbean water stuff.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's neat. Not as exciting as the paint-neater, but how can you top guns? You just can't.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So it's pretty cool, but I'm just not as excited.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And somewhere along the way, I downloaded some level creator pack or something like that.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They had a bunch of other stuff in there. I honestly don't remember doing that, but I guess I did at some point.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So that's kind of neat.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But I was going to play also Modination Racers, and granted I did all this like an hour before the show.

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So I meant to play Modination Racers as well, because I'm in the beta for that.

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
However, since I haven't played a little big planet in forever, I had to download the updates, which took 15 minutes.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh geez, yeah, I can imagine.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You know what? Hey, props to them, because that means they have just been putting update after update after update on that game.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Tons of updates.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think the last time I downloaded the update was update 1.05, and they're up to 1.23 now.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a bummer, though. It's not smart enough to just go,

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, I'm going to download the patch that takes you from 1.05 all the way up to, without having to download like five patches in between.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Something like that, yeah.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sometimes PC games do that, especially like MMOs.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So then, like I said, I played the levels a little bit.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's kind of neat. The water stuffs are, I mean, you can raise and lower the water. You have air that you can breathe in there.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You can suck up the bubbles much like you would in one of the other games out there that has the water stuff.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Sonic.

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sonic, yes. Perfect example.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And the Pirates of the Caribbean stuff is kind of neat.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The characters, obviously, they don't really have anything that looks too much like the stuff in the movie,

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
but the same typical plot. They have the two royal guards or whatever, the imperial guards or whoever they are,

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
from the movie are in there and that kind of thing.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I only got to play the first level, though, before I wanted to move on to other things.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Then I actually played a little bit on the arcade cabinet.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I had a friend over and we were testing out my newly souped up joysticks because I added octagonal restrictors in them now,

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and also tighter springs.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So I did everything except take apart the actual pushbuttons to put a little paper in there and stuff.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Honestly, I just don't want to mess with that because I have a feeling it's going to fall apart after a while.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's enough.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I played Marvel vs. Capcom 1 and I'm not very good at it.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but I couldn't figure out why I didn't have it yet,

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and it's because I don't have any Niomi games yet.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So that's why I basically spent most of the holiday doing was downloading Niomi games

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and downloading Sega Model A games and zinc emulation games and all sorts of crap.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, and CPS3 stuff, so I have Street Fighter 3 and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and all that fun stuff.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So anyways, the actual game I did play, we played all the way through Simpsons the arcade game on MAME, so that was fun.

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I love playing through there.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Nice. You know there's a Simpsons arcade on iPhone now, but it's not even the same thing.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's just the same name, and I think it's definitely inspired by the old arcade game, but it's not the old arcade game.

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And I think that's because this new one is EA, whereas the old one was Konami, right?

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Because it was the same engine as Turtles.

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So obviously they probably couldn't borrow the same code, but they did a game that feels very like it.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But instead of trying to save Maggie, I think it's Homer going after Donuts.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't know, I haven't played it. I've only read about it.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But I find it interesting that they are trying to cash in on that nostalgia a little bit in the very crowded iPhone market.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It was fun. I love playing the game.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I mean, we had a lot of fun playing it, so that was cool, and I'm trying to think of other stuff.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We were just trying a bunch of random games on there, but I still...

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Ms. World Nude 96, my favorite MAME game ever.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Didn't play that, but the problem is, see right now, I'm going through my list of games I have on there.

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because there's a ton of games, first off, clones that I have on there that I need to get rid of.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And I got rid of them on one list, but I need to get rid of them on the list that's for my front end so that they don't display on there.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And then also, I have a whole bunch of Mahjong games and crap I'm not going to play.

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So I have to go through and delete all that stuff or stuff that just doesn't work.

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You know, delete the Simpsons Arcade 4 player version, because I only have a 2 player cabinet, so that's just completely useless.

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So all that stuff. So I have to go through there and do that, because right now I'm trying to find something that's just...

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Luckily I can skip via letter, but even still, it's just you're holding it down, scrolling through lists of stuff just to try to find anything.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You sound like me trying to organize my iTunes library.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A friend of mine inspired me to organize my iTunes a little better, and I've been trying to do that.

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And it is a mess. Like, I have all these misspelled artists and albums and trying to get the right album art and things from compilations.

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a pain in the ass. It sounds very similar, just what you're describing is going through that whole process.

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah. So it'll be nice when it's done, especially I'm really excited to try some of these new Niomi games.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Because a lot of them don't necessarily work, and you have one emulator for Niomi disc based games and Dreamcast games,

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and you have another emulator for Niomi cartridge games, and some of those work and some of them don't.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So some of the ones that will work though, like Ikaruga, Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, there's some I haven't even heard of before.

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Like a lot of these really crazy shooter games.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Then just some of the normal ones like Senkei no Rondo in Radio Allergy or Ratagy or whatever.

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
A lot of the cave shooters and stuff like that.

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So that'll be kind of cool to put in there.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Especially now that I have the heavy springs on, the joysticks for really twitchy movements and stuff that'll really come in handy for shooters and stuff.

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So yeah, lots of downloading stuff for the cabinet.

195
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's mainly what I've been doing during the break.

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I still haven't played Borderlands. I was like, I'm gonna play Borderlands this break! I'm gonna do it!

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I haven't done it yet.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I even brought home Bayonetta. I was like, oh, I'm gonna play Bayonetta.

199
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What was it? Otomedius Gorgeous, the Konami shooter that has chicks flying around. I was gonna play that.

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Just didn't get around to it.

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There's just too many games. You have too many games to play.

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
People sometimes forget. We do this podcasting thing as a hobby. We don't get paid to do it.

203
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We're just gamers that do it for fun, just like many of you who listen to this show.

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The folks that review these professionally, that do have the time to play every single game that comes out,

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
usually teams of several people, that's their jobs. That's what they do for eight hours a day is play video games.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Wish I could do that. But then again, keep in mind, those reviewers, they have to play eight hours of the bad games as well as the good games.

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, one of my friends actually did some testing for a while. I was so sick of playing soccer.

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Testing or reviewing. I mean, sometimes, you know, that's a discussion for a whole other show.

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I wasn't even trying to get into strategy guides.

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I remember that, yeah.

211
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And they'll have you review. They'll just play through some of the most games. I still want to do that, though.

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You should. It'd be fun. Anyhow, sorry, Loki. Anything else you want to say about your gaming week?

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's basically it. It's just lots of downloading stuff, and I'm sure none of that's legal because, you know, they're ROMs and whatever.

214
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But you know what? I'm not going to go buy multi-thousand dollars worth of arcade boards.

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on the show.

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And if you are listening live to us on All Games Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, head on over to our chat room.

217
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com is the easiest way to get there.

218
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Or if you know your IRC, you just want to join the Game Surge Network on IRC gamesurge.net.

219
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And we are in channel pound orange lounge is the name of our chat room.

220
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Anyhow, reading some comments from chat, it went all the way back up here, talking about, I think Tiger Claw had said that it's appropriate.

221
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh yes, what a way to start the last show of the new year or decade with a bug.

222
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Going back to the bug. Because you know how sometimes, like, music will sometimes play when it's not supposed to here on the show.

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Whoops, live radio! Shit.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's the joys of live radio.

225
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Also reading some comments from chat, Ray Iyanami in our chat room says, PS, get your asses to SVGL, Sunnyvale Golf Land.

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There is a Simpsons machine here.

227
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You know what's interesting? There is Simpsons machines kind of still out there all over.

228
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I saw one randomly. I was at this hotel near Disneyland staying.

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They had a game room in the hotel.

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I haven't seen a game room in a hotel that wasn't a casino, like, since I was a teenager.

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's been a very long time.

232
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
One of the first times we went to Disneyland, there was a hotel that we stayed in that had a game room and I'd go down there.

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I wonder if it was the same hotel.

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Maybe, who knows. Was it near the convention center?

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, the convention center wasn't built.

236
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Anyhow, but the Simpsons arcade game, obviously a lot of people really remember this and it's still in arcades and probably still frickin' makes money.

238
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But, you know, this machine at this particular hotel, their game room was in pretty sad shape.

239
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Like, half the machines weren't working.

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I think the Simpsons one was, but it was where the monitor was, like, so bright you could not...

241
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like, it's just faded over time.

242
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But it hasn't faded dark. It's faded light.

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm not sure what causes that. Maybe sun fading or something?

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Even though it's in the dark room.

245
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, probably what happened was it burned in and they just turned the brightness up.

246
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ah, I see. To try and avoid that. I get it.

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
My gaming week. Some of the things I played this week.

248
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I did play a couple new games.

249
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Obviously Steam is having an obscene sale right now.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
As DarkSakura mentioned earlier, she picked up Braid.

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I picked up Luminous because the basic and advanced pack were on sale a couple days ago for three bucks.

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So I was like, eh, what the hell. I own Luminous on just about every other platform. I'll get it on PC as well.

253
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So, you know, that was cool. It's the same game.

254
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Certainly plays better than the iPhone one, although I still think the most underrated one is still the best one.

255
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And that was Luminous 2 on the PSP.

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I actually like the licensed music. Thank you very much.

257
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And it's kind of a pity that it didn't catch on a little more or else maybe we could have had a Luminous 3, a real one,

258
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
instead of just port after port after port of the same old game with some mediocre skins.

259
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I mean, the skins that are in the game are okay. Nothing that special.

260
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There's no shining. It's not even any Hollaback Girl, just so you know.

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Other stuff I played this week.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Saw a demo for a game called Crayon Physics, which was also on Steam.

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It was interesting. It was a very DS-inspired game

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
because you would basically have this little ball on your screen that, you know, you had to get the ball to the star.

265
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And you did that by drawing ramps.

266
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Or it was kind of interesting, like, you might have a little, like, a place where, like, a screw or a bolt is.

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And so you draw a hammer or something around the screw.

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And then it makes the hammer swing and, like, knock the ball.

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Like it's croquet or something knocks the ball across the screen.

270
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So kind of inventive, although it's kind of more the game I think I would imagine on the DS.

271
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But certainly, you know, not everybody owns a DS, but a lot of people own a PC.

272
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So this is a way for you to get into those kinds of games.

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I felt the game was a little basic.

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And the music was kind of crack.

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Like, it was really, like, trippy, scary almost, how happy trippy it was.

276
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It was a little bit frightening.

277
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Best description ever. Happy trippy.

278
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Happy trippy.

279
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's actually going to be 2DX 19th style or whatever they're up to now.

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Happy trippy.

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And DarkSakura holds up the thumb hat as she's talking there.

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So happy trippy thumb hat, 2DX 19th style.

283
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Let's see, what are the games I play this week?

284
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Tekken 6 I checked out for a little bit.

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I have to admit, my reaction to Tekken 6 after having spent a little time with it is,

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
lol what?

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Like, that was honestly pretty much the reaction I had every few minutes we were playing Tekken 6.

288
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Lol what?

289
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Dude is wearing pink pants and shoots electricity out of his hands while he's standing in water.

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Lol what?

291
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There's a giant transformer guy who shoots laser beams into the floor that makes me fall through and I instantly lose.

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Lol what?

293
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The last boss looks like Zombie Big Bird 8, like, Ra from Stargate and is glowing blue.

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Lol what is this game?

295
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Did we have any Voldo?

296
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Mr. Bondage Crotch?

297
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There's 40 fucking characters in the game and, you know, Tekken has obviously been lol what for a little while.

298
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It had the panda bears and the kangaroos.

299
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Voldo was so caliber, but I know that they brought in, like, some of the really weirdo ones.

300
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Well, of course, anything with Yoshimitsu in it is going to be...

301
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The training dummy.

302
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Did you play as Panda?

303
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I didn't play as Panda. I played with my favorite tranny bitch, Anna Williams.

304
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm telling you, in Tekken 6, she is one fierce transsexual.

305
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Obviously, I mean, no disrespect.

306
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
She just looks like your stereotypical, like, wearing all the leopard stuff and the boots and all that.

307
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like, literally, one of her moves, you know how everybody has a throw?

308
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
One of her moves, she grabs the guy, slaps him three times in the face, and then throws him.

309
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And then the other one...

310
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
She's always had that move.

311
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
She flips the guy over and, I swear to God, kicks him in the taint.

312
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Like, get out of here!

313
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, that's her.

314
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Well, you know what?

315
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I always thought that she was, like, an extra from Ab Fab.

316
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You know?

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Because we had to break out a cigarette and go,

318
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I feel peckish.

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And TigerClaws is saying about my Twitter earlier this week,

320
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, yeah, I read about your reaction. One of the characters is a tranny.

321
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Not really. Just kind of has all those, like, stereotypes you would see.

322
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I think, honestly, Anna Williams would actually best be described as,

323
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
if you ever saw the movie Angel from, like, 1981,

324
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
where she's a prostitute by night and an FBI agent by day,

325
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
that's the best way I could describe Anna Williams.

326
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I know. Lul, what?

327
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So that was pretty much my review of Tekken 6. Lul, what?

328
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Although, I thought it was interesting that in certain parts of the game,

329
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
if you're playing offline mode, it kind of simulates an online mode.

330
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You'll be playing against people with these fake gamer tags

331
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
that you're playing for promotions.

332
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Like, I was watching my friend play, and he got into one of these battles,

333
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and he was like, What the hell? I thought I was playing offline mode.

334
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't want to fight people online.

335
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You know, put the record at stake when you're not really, you know,

336
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
or just the fact that online players can sometimes be douchebags.

337
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You don't really want to play with them.

338
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But it simulates this whole thing in offline mode,

339
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
which is kind of strange but cool.

340
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The game is actually a lot more deep than I'm giving it credit for.

341
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Keep in mind I only looked at a couple modes on this particular outing with the game.

342
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Didn't really get too in-depth with the game, but yeah.

343
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Lul, what?

344
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's pretty much it.

345
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Also, AlphaCananagram in chat says,

346
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Skye, it's ghost data of players.

347
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's kind of strange to me.

348
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Like, are they actual real people?

349
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Because I saw, like, at signs and other signs

350
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
that I didn't think you could have in your gamertag as part of the people that we're fighting against.

351
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's weird that you can fight against ghosts.

352
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I guess the chatters are sending me straight that those are ghosts.

353
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They were around in Tekken 5, says Hitstun.

354
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
To be fair, I didn't play Tekken 5, so okay.

355
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Maybe that's just a new feature I wasn't aware of.

356
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, that's kind of freaky then.

357
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What if I don't want my ghosts to be online?

358
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Hitstun says, pretty cool, but they really only copied the user's combos.

359
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Which really is what Tekken's all about.

360
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There's not...

361
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Tekken is not the fighting game with fireballs and all these insane moves.

362
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Really, there's only low punch, high punch, low kick, high kick.

363
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And those are pretty much all the buttons you use to do everything in Tekken.

364
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And you just string all these combos and juggle, et cetera, et cetera.

365
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
AlphaCananagram also adds in,

366
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Tekken 6 has been in arcades for years,

367
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
so they get data from arcade machines.

368
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay. Interesting.

369
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I guess having that kind of come to light,

370
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
obviously the game doesn't explain that to you.

371
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I find that feature to be very interesting,

372
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
but it doesn't really change my little what reaction to the game.

373
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Anyhow.

374
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Let's see, other games I played this week.

375
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
A lot of World of Warcraft still.

376
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I already have a level 80 character.

377
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I've had one for a couple years.

378
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But now my new character I'm trying to get to 80,

379
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
my Paladin, my Dwarf Paladin.

380
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
She is level 78, two bubbles away from 79.

381
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Very, very close to level 80.

382
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And I'm excited because I'll actually be able to use the new Dungeon Finder with that.

383
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Hold on. I've got something for you guys.

384
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh.

385
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Fill time.

386
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
All right. Fill time.

387
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, I was going to actually mention something about this.

388
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Speaking of Warcraft and all this stuff,

389
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't usually listen to other podcasts,

390
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and I've kind of talked about why on the show before.

391
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I mean, obviously I listen to Bobby Black Wolf because he's live before we are.

392
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And I listen to most of his show because of that.

393
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But I don't want to inadvertently take ideas from other shows or what have you

394
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
and all this other stuff.

395
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

396
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Dr. Sakura is handing out presents.

397
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yay.

398
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Hold on. I'll open that in a minute.

399
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But on Christmas Day, Scott Rubin, who is the ringleader of allgames.com,

400
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
if you weren't already aware, was doing like a marathon live show.

401
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He was live for like five or six hours that day.

402
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And I actually called him and talked to him for a little while.

403
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It was pretty cool.

404
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm pretty sure it will be archived on All Games Radio's site.

405
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You can check that out.

406
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We talked a long time about digital distribution.

407
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I think he's very pro-digital distribution.

408
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We had a little lively debate about that.

409
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But I tuned in later on the iPhone app in my car

410
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
because I was driving to San Francisco Christmas night

411
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and I wanted to listen to more talk radio I thought would be good for the drive.

412
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But he wasn't on anymore.

413
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Instead, this other program was on talking about nothing but World of Warcraft.

414
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And it's called the Warcraft Outsiders,

415
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
which I think is a spinoff of Video Game Outsiders,

416
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
another All Games Radio program on the network.

417
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I have to say, as much as I don't often listen to other podcasts,

418
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I thought they did a pretty good job.

419
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
They knew their stuff talking about Warcraft and I thought it was interesting.

420
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Since I play the game all the time,

421
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I wasn't hearing a lot of news that I didn't already know,

422
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
but I kind of liked hearing about their experiences.

423
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The gal they have on that show, I think her name is Michelle,

424
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
was kind of like the ringleader of that show,

425
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
at least the particular episode I was listening to.

426
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
She knows her shit on Warcraft.

427
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I was very impressed.

428
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
She's a pretty hardcore raider and all that stuff.

429
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It was a good show, so I wanted to give them a shout-out

430
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
because we don't often give the other All Games Radio shows enough shout-outs here,

431
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
but we are all about supporting other independent radio and independent podcasts.

432
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Just because I say I personally don't listen to a lot of other podcasts

433
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

434
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You should go out there and support all the other podcasts out there,

435
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
especially if you decide Orange Launch Radio is not your cup of tea.

436
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I bet there is another show on the network.

437
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It is their cup of tea, so check that out.

438
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Now.

439
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Now.

440
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Now what? Open present?

441
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Now.

442
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Me first or Loki first?

443
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You throw your card, so go ahead.

444
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
La la la card.

445
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Crap.

446
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's a card, and on the tree it says,

447
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
wow, those are some really big balls,

448
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and the guy says, thanks.

449
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And it says, have a great big merry Christmas.

450
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Get it? The tree had big balls on it.

451
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I just fucked up my little hat.

452
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Now I'm going to open up this box.

453
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't want to ruin it.

454
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's his box, Rob. It cost a dollar.

455
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
This is terrible radio, though.

456
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Hold on. I'm opening a box, folks.

457
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
No, it's not a dick in a box.

458
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh, snap.

459
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It is a...

460
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Oh, cool. World of Warcraft year of here.

461
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It's like a 365-day calendar.

462
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm assuming like a desk calendar.

463
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yep.

464
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That shows little locales in the World of Warcraft.

465
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I will totally take this to work, and they'll really think I'm a freak.

466
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It'll be awesome.

467
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh, that's why I bought it.

468
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Great. That's cool.

469
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's for people to think you're a freak.

470
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Like on Tuesday, the 26th of January,

471
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
there's a little picture of the Violet Hold.

472
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
On Thursday, the 8th of July, there's a picture of Icecrown Citadel.

473
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
They just have all these little pictures from around Warcraft.

474
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That's kind of neat.

475
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah, I saw it, and I thought you'd appreciate it.

476
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
There's a vast world in Warcraft.

477
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That's one of the reasons to play.

478
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Pretty awesome.

479
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Okay, so, Loki.

480
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Open your box, Loki.

481
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Do it.

482
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
My card says, bacon, how'd you know?

483
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And it's a dog jumping up and down because he got a box full of bacon.

484
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Hope you get just what you're looking for this Christmas.

485
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Is that what you got?

486
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
A box full of bacon?

487
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Well, I don't know.

488
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Open your box!

489
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What's in the box?

490
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What's in the box?

491
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Do it!

492
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
La, la, box.

493
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What's in the fucking box?

494
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
La, la, box.

495
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Tell me what's in the box.

496
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Loki's opening his box very slowly.

497
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So, Rob, did you see the thing that I posted on Facebook earlier?

498
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The 30 seconds of Lich King?

499
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Uh-uh.

500
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I got the worst case scenario daily survival calendar 2010.

501
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Nice.

502
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Day-to-day guide to surviving a year's worth of peril.

503
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Isn't this what inspired your old advice column you used to do?

504
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yes.

505
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I used to have this calendar a few years ago, and I remember just cracking up on a daily

506
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
basis, and I figured that Loki would appreciate some advice, like how to deliver a baby.

507
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
In a mall.

508
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Very nice.

509
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
How to control a runaway camel.

510
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
How to navigate a minefield successfully.

511
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And how to drive Santa's sleigh.

512
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
If you can find some old-ass episodes of our to-go show, which I think was around 2005,

513
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
2006, when we first were getting into podcasting, we would do like a three to four hour live

514
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
show, then record another hour that was separately podcast.

515
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
We merged the shows finally, got smart and merged them together finally a couple years

516
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
later, but if you can find some old episodes of the to-go show, it was really funny, because

517
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Dark Sakura had these little advice columns that were like, lol what?

518
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
They have some pretty appropriate stuff, like for example, New Year's Day, it's an essential

519
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
survivor knowledge appropriate attire for winter weather.

520
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Really this should be the date before.

521
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
How to carry someone who has passed out.

522
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Very useful.

523
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I freaking love worst case scenario, so I thought that maybe Loki would too.

524
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
How to deflect a deflect encounter or a sword blow.

525
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Well it was either that or I was trying to decide who I was going to give the bitch a

526
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
day calendar to.

527
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
How does it actually have 365 bitches on it or is it like complaints?

528
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's like those magnet that you have the one that says remember when fat butts were in

529
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
there, or the I'm having screaming PMS with a really happy looking 40's chick on there.

530
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That type of thing.

531
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It was all stuff like that.

532
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
How to land a runaway hire balloon.

533
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Just in case.

534
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You never know, Loki.

535
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You never know.

536
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You might need it.

537
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Rama in chat is bragging.

538
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
He has all of the OLR to-go podcasts.

539
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I thought there was an archive online somewhere, and I know there's like, and Dark Tetsuya is

540
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
talking about the descriptions on the wiki, and I haven't talked about this a lot on the

541
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
show, but on Wikia.com, there's actually a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki that you can

542
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
look up, and it actually has like descriptions of the years and years worth of shows we've

543
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
done ever since the very first one on June 23rd of 2002.

544
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The one that I had the screaming migraine during?

545
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yes.

546
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The very first show.

547
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Crazy.

548
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So.

549
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Anyhow.

550
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Alright, well we've got to do our 350th show.

551
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's somewhat of a landmark number, yes?

552
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Multiple of 50?

553
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
By the way.

554
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Who's the baby on your screen right now on Facebook?

555
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That's our friend Megumi's baby.

556
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Luke.

557
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Aww.

558
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's cute.

559
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
He's cute.

560
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I know, it's great radio, but.

561
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Although that reaction is somewhat like, did you ever see Bat Boy on the World News?

562
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
No.

563
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Cover?

564
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
With a rah!

565
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
With a face?

566
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That's just a cute little baby yawn.

567
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Alright.

568
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

569
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Of course, we're on Twitter.

570
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Twitter.com slash OLR.

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We also have a Facebook now.

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

573
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You should definitely follow us on those sites.

574
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We will still be here live next Sunday and the Sunday after.

575
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I do not know yet what the plan is for the show on January the...

576
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm looking at my calendar here.

577
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
January the 17th.

578
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm going to be out of town.

579
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm going to Seattle for the long weekend because that is Martin Luther King weekend.

580
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
We have that day off of work.

581
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
When Southwest had an Uber sale, I booked a trip to Seattle.

582
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'll be gone that Sunday, so we'll figure out what we're doing then.

583
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I hear there's a best of in the works, so maybe that'll finally be ready by that week.

584
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm not sure.

585
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Just so you know.

586
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

587
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Believe it or not, we have some gaming news tonight.

588
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Tonight in part A, we're going to do kind of our usual thing,

589
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
talking about the news that happened this week,

590
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
even though it was a little bit of a slow news week with the holidays in the States and all.

591
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And then in part B, we're going to really talk about the year in review and the decade in review,

592
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
as I'm sure a lot of your favorite shows are doing this week because it was a slow news week.

593
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That's kind of what people talk about during the holidays.

594
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So, Loki, start us off tonight with some news.

595
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yes.

596
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Capcom has decided to pull a few games from their Quarter 1 2010 lineup,

597
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
including Super Street Fighter IV, Lost Planet 2, and Monster Hunter Tri.

598
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And from what I've seen, they haven't really announced yet when they're going to put these games out.

599
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
My guess would be not far after the first quarter, which ends, of course, April 1, 2010.

600
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So, basically, these games are scheduled to come out any time between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011,

601
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
because they're delayed to their fiscal 2011 year.

602
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And they said they're planning on spreading them across all four quarters,

603
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
which makes sense if you think about it because Capcom usually frontloads the first part of the year with their games,

604
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and I'm sure that a lot of the stuff that they put out ends up competing with itself.

605
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So, it kind of makes sense that you would want to spread that out.

606
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And they still do have some stuff coming out in the first quarter.

607
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
They have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Ultimate All-Stars, and, of course, Dark Void coming out as well.

608
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And that's not even including the other things that they're planning on releasing digital distribution-wise,

609
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
including Mega Man 10.

610
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So, a lot of stuff coming out still.

611
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's still a little bit disappointing, though, because when I read the article, what you say makes a lot of sense.

612
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
They don't want to load the year too front-heavy, I guess, for lack of a better term.

613
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But there were some big, you know, like Super Street Fighter IV,

614
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I had the feeling we were going to be playing it come February or March.

615
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I still think we may.

616
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I still think it may come out in like April or May, not too far from where it was,

617
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
because originally it was kind of slated around March,

618
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and I think now it's just going to be coming out slightly later, maybe in April or something.

619
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Same with Monster Hunter Tri and Lost Planet 2.

620
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Dead Rising 2 still at some point.

621
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But, I mean, they have a pretty big slate of games coming out this year.

622
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's just, you know, not putting them all out at the same time.

623
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Well, since tonight is, in some respects, a year in a review show,

624
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I mean, God, this news is nothing new.

625
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's like all we've heard over the past four months,

626
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
or really ever since probably like July when we were talking about games coming out at the end of the year.

627
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.

628
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Like, I really feel like, you know, we've been doing this show a long time.

629
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I really feel like this year especially.

630
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I mean, games always get delayed. I get that.

631
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But this year especially, I really feel like lots of games got delayed.

632
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well, a lot of it's because of Modern Warfare 2,

633
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and a lot of people were afraid to kind of take on Modern Warfare 2,

634
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
and so they've delayed their games to other parts of the year,

635
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
which is fine because I think that's good.

636
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Normally we get these really dead months where there's nothing coming out,

637
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and I'm like, you know, hey, it'd be the perfect time to put this game out

638
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
because there's really nothing competing with it right now.

639
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Like April, I mean, most of April's going to be pretty dead.

640
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I mean, you're going to have Red Dead Redemption on the 27th,

641
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
but as far as I'm aware, there's normally not much coming out in April.

642
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's pretty dead.

643
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Isn't that kind of traditional, though, that not much comes out around that time?

644
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Because that's when you're starting to get into finals and college,

645
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
which is your big gaming base and so forth.

646
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
They don't care about that kind of stuff, though.

647
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
They're really...

648
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You don't think that kind of stuff cuts into sales?

649
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
No, I don't think it really matters.

650
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I think it's just development cycles and really a lot of this stuff,

651
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
you know, they try to push it out before the end of March because...

652
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Wait a minute. Isn't Final Fantasy 13 April, or is that March?

653
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
That's March.

654
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay, my bad.

655
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah, so Final Fantasy 13's kind of the beginning of March,

656
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
but that may be another reason, too, why some of these delays are happening

657
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
because if they're coming out around the same time as Final Fantasy 13,

658
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
maybe that's another...

659
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah, it's not as big as Modern Warfare 2, but it's going to be pretty big.

660
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And it's a completely different audience, you know what I mean?

661
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Like the kind of people that play Final Fantasy 13

662
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
aren't going to play these other types of games.

663
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Well, you know, there's always somebody that plays both.

664
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Well, Monster Hunter, I think, kind of, you know, it's a little similar.

665
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay, I can see that kind of having some similar crossover.

666
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Street Fighter, yeah, not much of a crossover there, but still, though, it's, you know...

667
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's a very similar strategy to how they do movies, right?

668
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You hear about movies getting delayed all the time

669
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
because they don't want to compete against another movie that's too similar,

670
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
but movies that are completely kind of different is okay.

671
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Like, for instance, a lot of weekends you have a big bang-up action movie

672
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
opening up against a movie targeted at women

673
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
that's more like, you know, Meryl Streep's vagina, da-da-da.

674
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You know, like all these, you know, kind of softer things

675
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
usually open up kind of together.

676
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Like, look at Christmas. We had Sherlock Holmes, Avatar

677
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
are both kind of, you know, bang-up action-y type things.

678
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And then you have the Meryl Streep movie.

679
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Oh, yeah.

680
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Alvin and the Chipmunks for kids, you know, different audiences.

681
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And then look at also, like, you know, some of the releases and stuff on different platforms.

682
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You know, the first part of the year so far,

683
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
there's not really any first-party Microsoft games coming out,

684
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
at least in the first quarter.

685
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I've seen there's nothing coming out from them yet,

686
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
or it has been announced.

687
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You know, I'm kind of surprised there.

688
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I would have thought, you know, maybe Crackdown 2 might be coming out.

689
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Or, hey, even, you know, maybe...

690
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh, what was it?

691
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I can't remember the name of the game now.

692
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh, that's all right, because I'm not buying it.

693
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
The other Microsoft, Alan Wake, that's right.

694
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The one that's been delayed forever, you know.

695
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It probably won't be that great.

696
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Oh, it looks all right.

697
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But I guess it's good that they're delaying stuff just a little bit, you know,

698
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
and it kind of sucks because they have to kind of lower their projections

699
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
for how they're going to finish up their, you know, 2010 financial year.

700
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But in the end, I think it's going to end up being more beneficial to them

701
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
because they're going to be able to capitalize on these dead parts of, you know, the year

702
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and maybe not necessarily competing with these big blockbuster games.

703
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But then again, you know, you have these companies that still put out everything in the fourth quarter,

704
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
like Activision, you know.

705
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
They put their big games right there in November, October.

706
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And, you know, I don't think this year is going to be different.

707
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Obviously, you're going to have another Call of Duty game

708
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and some more Guitar Hero games and some more, you know, DJ Hero and who knows what.

709
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Hmm.

710
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's definitely going to be a busy year next year,

711
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
but then I wonder how much we're going to hear next year.

712
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Delayed again, delayed again, lololol.

713
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
There's going to be a lot of stuff that's delayed.

714
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Natal delayed, Sony Motion delayed, hahaha.

715
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
That's the other thing too.

716
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
There's a lot of that stuff coming out, you know, kind of in the,

717
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I want to say it was supposed to be the second quarter,

718
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and maybe some of these games are going to use some of that.

719
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Maybe they're delaying it because of that.

720
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Or maybe they're going to delay them to add that kind of stuff.

721
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Or maybe, I don't know.

722
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Or maybe we're talking out our ass because we don't really know.

723
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
We don't know. We can only guess.

724
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
All right. Hey, speaking of talking out your ass about things you may not know about,

725
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
it's sure fun to speculate what this is all about.

726
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Apparently, in Europe, Namco Bandai has made a new trademark.

727
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's called Pac-Man Battle Royale.

728
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Don't know what the heck that could be.

729
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Could that be a fighting game involving Pac-Man?

730
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
One of the interesting theories is that it's some type of multiplayer champion edition

731
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
because obviously Pac-Man Championship Edition, you know,

732
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
really kind of revitalized the series in a way.

733
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Not a lot of previous Pac-Man games have done.

734
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I mean, I don't know if you guys know,

735
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
but there's been lots of Pac-Man games since the original and Ms. Pac-Man

736
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and even, like, Junior Pac-Man, some of those things.

737
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Like Pac-Mania and all that.

738
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But then, gosh, there was a lot of, like, weird Pac-Man platformer games.

739
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Pac-Land.

740
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yeah, and all these weird things that were on PlayStation and so forth.

741
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Pac-Man Championship Edition kind of took the game back to its roots and energized it,

742
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
kind of gave it a little bit of a, you know, I don't know,

743
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
music game infused boost in a way and more fast-paced action.

744
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's kind of thought that maybe a sequel to that could be where this is going.

745
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But if I seem to remember right,

746
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
the guy who originally made Pac-Man was involved with Championship Edition,

747
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
which might be part of the reason why it was so successful.

748
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
If he's not involved here, I'm a little worried, but who knows?

749
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But could this be just, like, something very similar to that Pac-Man game that they had

750
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
that was originally supposed to come out on the GameCube and never did

751
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
or something like that?

752
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Like the versus?

753
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, like the versus.

754
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It was out, but it was really hard to get, if I remember right,

755
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
because Dark Soccer was talking about playing it, I remember, years ago.

756
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
She was talking about, you remember Pac-Man versus?

757
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah.

758
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah, that was out, but it was kind of hard to find, wasn't it?

759
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
We had a bunch of copies of it.

760
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't remember how, maybe a chatter remembers this better.

761
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
There was something you had to do to get it.

762
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
We had a stack of them and we're giving them out.

763
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah, but you had to get a copy of it somehow.

764
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It was, you probably had that because of Game Store connections,

765
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
but there was a way you were supposed to get it.

766
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't know if it was, like, a pre-order bonus or what.

767
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I think it was.

768
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I think it was too.

769
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So, anyhow, who knows what this game could be all about,

770
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
but of course when I hear Pac-Man Battle Royale,

771
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't know about you guys, but I think about the old Japanese movie

772
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
where they might strand Pac-Man on a desert island with his peers

773
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and give him only a fan to survive.

774
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Paper plate.

775
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That would be pretty amazing if that was actually the case,

776
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
but I somehow doubt that.

777
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Hey, I've won Paper Plate Battle Royale.

778
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I just can't see an M-rated Pac-Man game for the life of me.

779
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
No.

780
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Although it would be funny.

781
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Well, how about something that is a little bit more on the mature level,

782
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
even if it's not M-rated?

783
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
My single favorite Castlevania game ever,

784
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Dracula X Rondo of Blood,

785
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
is coming to Virtual Console.

786
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's about damn time.

787
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But, um, guess where?

788
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Hmm.

789
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Australia.

790
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Hence my comment before the show.

791
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Well, which only they heard if you're live tonight, but that's alright.

792
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Which is very interesting because Australia has been getting a lot of bad news lately

793
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
as far as video games go, so this is kind of interesting.

794
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Well, the OLFC actually has a rating up for,

795
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,000
as is titled Castlevania Rondo of Blood for Virtual Console release.

796
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I hope that we get it over here, but I don't know.

797
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It's such a fun game.

798
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I mean, I hate having to break out the PC Engine every time I want to play it,

799
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
or try to find the PSP version.

800
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Honestly, I still prefer the PC Engine version over the PSP.

801
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
If this game were to come out on Virtual Console,

802
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
wouldn't it be the first PC Engine CD game to do so?

803
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Didn't we get, um, Ys?

804
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
No.

805
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm sorry, I've got Ys Book 1 and 2 on CD.

806
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I can't remember. There's so many games on Virtual Console now.

807
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'd have to look at the list.

808
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I think Ys has been revived on the DS.

809
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I know there's been some newer games there, or PSP,

810
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
but I don't think the originals ever came to Virtual Console.

811
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I could be wrong. Somebody in chat might correct us.

812
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
We'll have to check.

813
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I don't think the originals ever did.

814
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Chatters do our dirty work for us. Go check.

815
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Well, we're trying to talk about the news here.

816
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
But the other thing I want to point out, I mean, honestly,

817
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
if it's coming to Australia and the technology is there

818
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and the game is going to be ported to work,

819
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
don't you think it's going to come out here before too long?

820
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I mean, isn't that just kind of a given?

821
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The economy still loves us.

822
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Very rarely do these games come out in one country

823
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
and then never come out in another. You know what I mean?

824
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Why Australia first?

825
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Well, it could just be that maybe that's where the news has leaked.

826
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Maybe it's really planned for everywhere,

827
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
but the news has just happened to leak for Australia.

828
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Possibly. Maybe they had to put in their request for rating,

829
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
like some earlier date.

830
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Right, and these ratings requests are how game announcements

831
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
leak all the freaking time.

832
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
They've tried to take measures to stop that here with the ESRB in the States,

833
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
but that doesn't change Australia, Europe, and some of the other countries

834
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
where we get our titles spoiled from.

835
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Well, you know, I'll have that in an instant.

836
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I know. I will actually check that out too.

837
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It would be finally a way I can actually play this game

838
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
because I didn't collect all these systems that Dark Sakura did.

839
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I told you to come up and play it.

840
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I know, but it would be nice to have it in my own house.

841
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I mean, not that I don't enjoy spending time with Dark Sakura,

842
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
but it would be nice to fire it up whenever I want.

843
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
If I want to play at 2 a.m., I don't have to call you.

844
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Wednesday.

845
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't know yet. I might actually have that day off work,

846
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
so I'll let you know. Super.

847
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The end.

848
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yeah.

849
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So Namco, they've got a lot of great games out there,

850
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and some of those you may have missed.

851
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And some crappy ones too, just for the record.

852
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Some crappy ones you may have missed and may not want to play.

853
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Would you really miss them if they're crappy?

854
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You may not know that you've missed them.

855
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You may just want to collect the achievements and or trophies.

856
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Exactly.

857
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Well, you may get your chance to do that again,

858
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
because now they're going to actually be launching their back catalog

859
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
via digital distribution.

860
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And this is going to be happening on a few different fronts.

861
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Of course, the Xbox 360.

862
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
They're going to be putting up me and my beautiful Katamari

863
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
sometime in the first quarter of 2010.

864
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And then on the PlayStation Portable,

865
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
me and my Katamari on December 22nd.

866
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So it's already out there if you want to snag that.

867
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And of course, you know, that being said,

868
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
they're also planning on putting out other PlayStation 1 and PSP

869
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
catalog titles as well on the PlayStation Network.

870
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And there are also maybe other titles coming to the Xbox 360 as well,

871
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
but they haven't really named names yet.

872
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So that's kind of neat though.

873
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
More Katamari or more of the old Katamari.

874
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, but that was like the worst Katamari game in the series.

875
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Both of those ones you named were like the low points in the series.

876
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Personally, I did not enjoy Beautiful Katamari.

877
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I have friends that say I'm totally not being fair to that game and so forth.

878
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And maybe they think there's a grudge because of the history our show has

879
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
with that particular title.

880
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But no, I think really you put that side by side with Katamari forever

881
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
on the PS3, and it just ain't no contest.

882
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The PS3 one's better.

883
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Even though the PS3 one is a rehash of some of the old stuff,

884
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I still say the PS3 one's better.

885
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And just wait for the PS3 one to drop down in price,

886
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
because it will pretty quick.

887
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Because it will kind of fade off pretty fast.

888
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And you probably will be able to pick up in the new Katamari game

889
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
for 20 bucks or something.

890
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And that's about what you're going to pay for these re-releases.

891
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So just be patient.

892
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Very interesting how digital distribution is kind of best known for this year.

893
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Breathing new life into games that had slipped off the radar,

894
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
which is exactly what Namco is doing here.

895
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But I compare this to, you know how Steam is doing their epic sale right now,

896
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
where I swear they undercut this shit down to cost just to get people in the door.

897
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
They might even be taking losses on it.

898
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I don't know what they're doing,

899
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
but they're just trying to get as many Steam subscribers as they can.

900
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
But some of the games they're selling would have fallen off the radar a long time ago.

901
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
For example, I think they were selling the LucasArts pack for like 3 bucks,

902
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
which was the Indiana Jones games,

903
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
and Loom and all that was on sale for 3 bucks the other day.

904
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Well, you know, yeah that might be a steal,

905
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
but at the same time for the publisher and all the sales people involved,

906
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
that's 3 bucks they probably weren't going to get,

907
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
because these games are so freaking old, who buys them anymore?

908
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But digital distribution kind of opens it all up.

909
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Very interesting.

910
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Anyhow, moving on to another story and talking about digital distribution of sorts.

911
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
There is a new just launched music game store inside the Xbox Live marketplace.

912
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
This just went live I believe on the 22nd, so it was a little bit earlier this week,

913
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
but now there is a music game store within Xbox Live.

914
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You actually can look at individual stores for Guitar Hero 5,

915
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Guitar Hero World Tour, Band Hero, Lips, Lips No. 1 Hits,

916
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Lego Rock Band, Beatles Rock Band, whatever rock band there is.

917
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
They all have these special front end stores where you can actually sample music tracks

918
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and download the songs.

919
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You might be thinking, well I can already do that in the game.

920
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah, you can, but now you can also do it through the Xbox 360 interface,

921
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
which is kind of cool that you don't have to go find the disc to put it in the drive

922
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
to sample the latest releases,

923
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
because sometimes we might be rattling off the releases here on the show,

924
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
or you read about them on the internet somewhere and you're like,

925
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I think I remember that song and I think I remember liking it,

926
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
but I don't remember what it sounds like.

927
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Now you can just go onto your Xbox and look at the little 30 second sample.

928
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Interesting how music and the Xbox 360 have been fusing together

929
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
a little more and more this year, not just with this, but last FM.

930
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
If you remember from E3 though, a couple years ago,

931
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
they said that that was one of the things that they wanted to do to begin with,

932
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
was offer the multimedia interaction with the games.

933
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So there you go.

934
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah, so I have not checked out that storefront myself,

935
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
but I'm looking at some of the screenshots and it's nice that every game

936
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
kind of gets its own little look and logo and so forth,

937
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
but where's Rock Revolution?

938
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Just kidding. I don't care.

939
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Where's the dedicated store?

940
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh yeah, in the clearance bin. That's where it is.

941
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
$4.99.

942
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Xbox Live should have its own little clearance bin of sorts.

943
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Here's our dumpster, I mean, clearance bin.

944
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It kind of looks like Borderlands. It's like just this wasteland.

945
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I've got a great idea for Microsoft.

946
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
You can do something similar to that with Project Natal,

947
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
where you actually dig through the clearance bin with your hands,

948
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
making different gestures using the Natal camera,

949
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
so you can find the Rock Revolution in there for $4.99.

950
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Nice.

951
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Yeah, no one would ever get it.

952
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Let's talk about some news about a game no one cares about.

953
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay, what would that be?

954
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Champions Online!

955
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Actually, there is going to be a new update and an iPhone app

956
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and a recruitment initiative.

957
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Please play our game.

958
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I know, right?

959
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
There is Champions Companion for the iPhone,

960
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
which you can use to review your character and see your online status,

961
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
check your friends list, your mail, read news, it's free.

962
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
There's also a referral program to where you can invite a friend

963
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
to play free for 10 days,

964
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
and you will get a rare in-game action figure, boo,

965
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and have some combat buffs.

966
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Ooh!

967
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And you also get another costume slot and 400 cryptic points,

968
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
so I guess that's kind of okay.

969
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And then they did an Attack of the Misfit Toys event over the weekend

970
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
with new costume pieces, action figures, perks, that type of stuff.

971
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Please come play our game.

972
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I know, right?

973
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
We need people.

974
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I think we had a story just like this a couple weeks ago,

975
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
but it was Age of Conan.

976
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Very similar type of thing.

977
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
They're practically giving the game away to get people to play it.

978
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
They already know where it's going to come in,

979
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
and that's going to be with Star Trek.

980
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
That's what I'm holding out for.

981
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Ironically enough, isn't that what got a lot of people to sign up

982
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
for Champions Online in the first place,

983
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
was guaranteed access to Star Trek Online's beta or something like that?

984
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I remember if you got an Uber subscription to Champions,

985
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
you could play Star Trek Online early or something.

986
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You know what, that wins the whatever award.

987
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That should have been a warning sign right there.

988
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Because I'm already getting a beta.

989
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Our chat room's actually lighting up with comments on the last story

990
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
because we're a little bit behind.

991
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It takes time for what we say to encode

992
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and you guys to hear it through the All Games feed and so forth.

993
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
They're still talking about Rock Revolution a little bit

994
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
because I was giving it a little shit in chat earlier.

995
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Rama in chat says,

996
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Sorry, Rock Revolution was well worth the $5 I paid for it.

997
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Brad from Pod Culture asks,

998
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
What sucked more, Rock Revolution or Yaris?

999
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
To be fair, Yaris probably sucked more.

1000
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yaris, but for your suck to money value...

1001
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yaris is free.

1002
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But here's the thing though about Yaris.

1003
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yaris led way for a whole bunch of piracy on Xbox Live Arcade.

1004
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So thank you, Yaris.

1005
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I will say this too.

1006
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Rock Revolution was actually way better than Beaten Groovy,

1007
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
which you would also pay, I think, $10 for on Xbox Live Marketplace.

1008
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
That game was disgusting.

1009
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
It was insultingly bad.

1010
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Whoever allowed that piece of shit to go on Xbox Live Marketplace

1011
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
should be ashamed of themselves

1012
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and should consider possibly retiring from the industry.

1013
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It was terrible.

1014
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It's not that difficult to make a successful music game, Konami.

1015
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I mean, you've done it in the past.

1016
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
You just kind of have to copy what you did.

1017
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
But somehow you just fuck it up.

1018
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And I don't know how you do that.

1019
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's like,

1020
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Ah, they won't get it over in America.

1021
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Let's make it all ghetto looking.

1022
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Yeah, that's awesome.

1023
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Way to shit on your fans.

1024
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And trust me, we're not into that over here.

1025
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
That's other countries.

1026
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Yep.

1027
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Alright, we're going to travel around the world and look at some release dates.

1028
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Hopefully some good things coming out soon.

1029
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Although, then again, it's that time of year where probably there ain't shit coming out.

1030
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I don't know, Loki. Is that the story here?

1031
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'm pretty sure that's correct.

1032
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
There is nothing coming out.

1033
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And at least last I checked, there was nothing coming out.

1034
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And if there is anything coming out this week, it's probably crap.

1035
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
But, I mean, I guess if you count Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles,

1036
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
the Crystal Bears came out today.

1037
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So that's something, I guess.

1038
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And supposedly this week, Divinity II Ego Draconis is supposed to be coming out on PC and Xbox 360.

1039
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I thought that was supposed to be next week, but hey.

1040
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I could be wrong because they move that stuff around all the time.

1041
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And also possibly Learn Chess and Learn Geography on the DS from Dreamcatcher,

1042
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
which are probably something you can skip.

1043
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And then finally, Dreamer Zookeeper on the DS, also from Dreamcatcher.

1044
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And World Party Games coming to you on the Wii.

1045
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yes, it's yet another party game collection.

1046
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And that's basically it, although don't be surprised if all those move to next week.

1047
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Really, it's the same story in Japan.

1048
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Literally not a damn thing coming out.

1049
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It's very quiet over there right now.

1050
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
A price reduction on Tactics A2 on the DS is about all you got going for you.

1051
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And honestly, there's really not a lot to look forward to until January 9th

1052
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
when Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep hits the Sony PSP.

1053
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
That's probably the next big, big release over in Japan.

1054
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah, I didn't find a damn thing for Europe, sorry.

1055
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's just that time of year, folks, but we talk about them every week.

1056
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So this is a good week to go back and play the games you missed this year in 2009, yes?

1057
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Pretty much.

1058
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Pretty much.

1059
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Pretty much.

1060
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
All right, so back to some news then.

1061
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yes, so soon, and I'm not sure if this is actually going to happen

1062
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
because I could think a lot of other people would be pissed off for other reasons.

1063
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
But pretty soon, you may not be able to play your PSP or DS on airplanes.

1064
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Apparently, somebody is trying to consider a ban on all electronic devices aboard planes.

1065
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And apparently, the US Transport Security Administration is the one kind of doing that.

1066
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Apparently, there is a guy, Omar, I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name anyways,

1067
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
the guy was arrested after failing to ignite an explosive device on Christmas Day on a plane.

1068
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh God, I heard about that on CNN.

1069
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So that had to do with electronic devices?

1070
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yes, apparently, let's see.

1071
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
One motherfucker always ruins it for everybody else.

1072
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You know how you can't take in water over a certain size

1073
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and your shampoo has to be in a clear bottle and in a plastic bag.

1074
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'm not mad, I understand that they're doing it for our safety and what have you,

1075
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
but it's because some asshole threatened to use it as a bomb

1076
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
and said that you could use water as a...

1077
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's just frustrating.

1078
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Apparently, it doesn't really say if it was an explosive looking like a device or something like that.

1079
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
They probably don't want to tell you how he did it.

1080
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Good old fashioned American paranoia has been increased tenfold.

1081
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Following the incident, international flight passengers weren't allowed any personal items on their laps

1082
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
an hour before the flight.

1083
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Full bag searches were instigated at the boarding gates and the ban on electronic devices has said,

1084
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
to be a reaction to his ability to smuggle an explosive onto the plane.

1085
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This would of course mean any DS or PSP would be banned as well as anything from electronic books,

1086
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
iPods, cell phones, other gaming devices, etc.

1087
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
That's going to make flights so incredibly boring.

1088
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
It's not going to fly.

1089
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Pun intended.

1090
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Honestly, I'm surprised he was able to do that because they scan all that stuff through...

1091
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Well, he was on an international flight.

1092
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
He didn't get screened at a US airport.

1093
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
He got screened at a Dutch airport.

1094
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't know what they do over there that's different than what they do over here,

1095
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
but he didn't get in in the US.

1096
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
You have a bomb.

1097
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
No.

1098
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Okay, you may go.

1099
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
You know, I really don't see them banning all electronics on planes.

1100
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I think that's a bit much.

1101
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And it's going to suck because I know a lot of airlines are looking into,

1102
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
like I think Virgin Air or one of them,

1103
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
if they're not already doing it was looking into like free Wi-Fi on flights now.

1104
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Like that's what the technology has gotten is you can get on the internet on flights,

1105
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
which is pretty amazing.

1106
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And it would really suck to kind of rip that all away.

1107
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
But at the end of the day, if there is a true threat, I suppose for lack of a better term,

1108
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
to, you know, electronic devices on planes,

1109
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
something that they can't screen for at the airport for God knows whatever reason.

1110
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Here's something.

1111
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
A safety first.

1112
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Here's something to...

1113
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
People didn't have laptops 20 years ago, 30 years ago.

1114
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Flights will still work, you know.

1115
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Well, what if some dude was to create an EMP bomb using electronic devices?

1116
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Can't detect that because it's not an explosive.

1117
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
The plane would go down.

1118
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Exactly.

1119
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
But that's the point.

1120
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
They want it to explode or, you know, something.

1121
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Someone's probably thought of that.

1122
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
They have something.

1123
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
They don't advertise all their countermeasures.

1124
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I mean, for obvious reasons.

1125
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
First of all, if anyone was going to actually be able to project an EMP

1126
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
that would make a plane go down, it'd be a bigger device.

1127
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It wouldn't be something that could be hidden that easily.

1128
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I don't know.

1129
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'm just playing devil's advocate.

1130
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
No, I know.

1131
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It's just...

1132
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Although that really would be about the only thing I could think of.

1133
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
SSJ-100 Matt wants to add.

1134
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Rob, he hid firecrackers in his crotch.

1135
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
The Dutch screeners scanned him, but they wouldn't have found them unless they patted him down.

1136
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That seems so odd to me.

1137
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
How a fucking firecracker gonna...

1138
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
How many did he have in his crotch?

1139
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Maybe it was one of those things where, you know, it only takes a spark to ignite

1140
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
if you have something flammable.

1141
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I don't know.

1142
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Obviously they're not telling you the details on what he was planning to do for obvious reasons,

1143
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
but I still find it shocking that he was able to hide firecrackers undetected.

1144
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
You know.

1145
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It sucks.

1146
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I don't know what else to say.

1147
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It sucks.

1148
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Kick dirt mound.

1149
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Wah.

1150
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
This is a little less suck, although I don't know.

1151
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
We'll see when the first issue comes out.

1152
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Electronic Gaming Monthly is coming back.

1153
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You might remember the plug was pulled on Electronic Gaming Monthly a few months ago

1154
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
because, you know, the recession, etc., etc.

1155
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
People don't read video game magazines because of the internet, etc., etc.

1156
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But Electronic Gaming Monthly apparently is coming back.

1157
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's going to be coming back with an April issue that's released in March

1158
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
because, you know, they come out a month before the actual date on the magazine.

1159
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And that's when it's coming out.

1160
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
There's a press release that came out that announced that it will be coming out

1161
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and there's also going to be an eGMI, the digital magazine.

1162
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I guess there's a special code that will be in the issue that allows you to access

1163
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
the digital components for exclusive article extensions and original content.

1164
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So trying to get you to buy the, you know, try to tie it into the internet.

1165
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Yeah, if it's anything like Game Informer does, it's kind of useless.

1166
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And here's my, you know, devil's advocate to this.

1167
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I applaud them for trying to do something different,

1168
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
but at the same time this exclusive digital content will be reprinted

1169
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and copy-pasted somewhere else within milliseconds.

1170
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I mean, this is the age of the internet.

1171
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
You're not going to put a bombshell news thing in there

1172
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
and expect it not to get republished somewhere else, you know what I mean?

1173
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah.

1174
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
A little silly, but I don't know.

1175
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Features and things I suppose are a little harder to get.

1176
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Anyone that doesn't have a subscription to Game Informer

1177
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and pretty much if you shop at GameStop and you have one of their cards,

1178
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
you have a subscription because you get it for free when you get their stupid card.

1179
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Anyways, I mean, the online portion of it is kind of useless.

1180
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I mean, they have some additional screenshots usually

1181
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,000
or, you know, some articles or interviews or whatever, like extended interviews.

1182
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
But it's nothing really like, oh my god, that's so awesome, you know, that they have on there.

1183
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It's not like Core or something like that where you get, you know, games or something like that.

1184
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I miss the old magazines with demo discs.

1185
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Of course, nowadays, you know, I used to subscribe to the Xbox magazine

1186
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
because you used to get some demos that weren't available on Live,

1187
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
but now they put out demos that are already available on Live.

1188
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It's like, why the fuck do I even bother?

1189
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I'm not going to buy your stupid magazine with a demo disc.

1190
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Because maybe you're still on dial-up.

1191
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
You know, we've got a whole box full of old demo discs.

1192
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Now occasionally, though, they did have some free download content in there, which is kind of cool.

1193
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
They had a few Oblivion expansions and stuff like that were free.

1194
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So that's kind of cool. That's a little bit of a value.

1195
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But, you know, I kind of miss the days like, well, you know, I used to buy PC Gamer too.

1196
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
They used to have a whole bunch of shareware and free shit on there.

1197
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Well, wouldn't it now just be type in the code and get a demo on PSN or Xbox Live?

1198
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Yeah, they could do that.

1199
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Why bother with the cost of discs now? It's all digital.

1200
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But then again, you could just read it. They can't do that, though, because...

1201
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Well, I mean, they've done it in the past, so with...

1202
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I mean, take it a step further. What is CORE?

1203
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
CORE magazine on PlayStation Network is basically just that. It's the demos and everything.

1204
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Oh, but the magazine's online too. I mean...

1205
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Yeah. The era of print is kind of going away.

1206
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Well, Electronic Human Monthly is going to try to make it last.

1207
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I mean, at the same time, you don't bring your PS3 onto the john with you,

1208
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
so magazines will always at least serve a purpose there.

1209
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So if you want to pick up your bathroom reader of Electronic Gaming Monthly,

1210
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:49,000
it will feature stuff by Dan, Shu, Su, Sean Baby is part of the crew as well, and so on and so on.

1211
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
A lot of names you might recognize from previous years.

1212
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Oh, he did the comic, the Su and Sean comic.

1213
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I used to read those, like, all the time.

1214
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And they had a webcomic, I think, for a little while too.

1215
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Well, if you want to check that out, it will be coming out soon, so check out the newsstands.

1216
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Well, here's some other stuff you can spend your money on.

1217
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
What's that?

1218
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Sackboy plushies. They are now on Amazon.

1219
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
You can get a Sackboy and a Sackgirl for 20 bucks.

1220
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Ooh. But they won't have any until December 30th. Ooh.

1221
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I didn't like the look of the Sackgirl on there.

1222
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
No, the Sackgirl looks stupid, but the Sackboy's pretty cute.

1223
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Yeah, because, I mean, the Sackboy is the one that's actually on the front cover, so that's kind of cool.

1224
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Yeah, I like, I think, and besides that, you know, can't she wear something other than pink?

1225
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't know. I guess not.

1226
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Sackboy's adorable.

1227
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Well, Team Fortress 2, if you don't have enough friends to play the game with you, Valve has the answer for you.

1228
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
They are beta testing right now AI opponents.

1229
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Yes, you will be able to use some pretty intelligent bots as your opponents to fill in, you know, gaps that you may have on your team.

1230
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And apparently, I believe this is available now, and they do have some stuff you use in the console,

1231
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:20,000
including ways to add people to there or remove AI players and whatnot.

1232
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But apparently they're pretty cool, and they actually, I don't know, are good replacements for people that may not be there.

1233
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And I think they've done this in, like, Counter-Strike and stuff like that, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do it here.

1234
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I don't know.

1235
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Something to keep the game going with lots of original stuff, I suppose, you know?

1236
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'd like an offline version of Team Fortress 2 with bots. That'd be pretty fun.

1237
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Some people don't like to play online with real people.

1238
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I hate real people.

1239
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Real people can sometimes be a pain in the ass, you know?

1240
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Unless we're playing a Grand Theft Auto, which, by the way, I remember back in the day, listeners complaining that they couldn't play Grand Theft Auto with me.

1241
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Okay, I've been playing ranked games now almost every day. None of our listeners are playing.

1242
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
What's up with that?

1243
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It's free to play now. We play 10 AM and 3 PM Pacific around there within probably about half an hour or so.

1244
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And just a ranked deathmatch in the Ballad of Gay Tony.

1245
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:31,000
And feel free to join our game because we want to give out your gamertag to LokiOLR.

1246
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
All one word.

1247
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Feel free. You can't really be invited into the game. You just have to join a ranked game.

1248
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Trust me, there's hardly anyone playing right now. It's really easy to join the game.

1249
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:51,000
So you can just see if I'm online, most likely playing Grand Theft Auto, join the game, and prepare to get your ass kicked.

1250
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Nice. It's so modest.

1251
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Alright, Loki's throwing down the gauntlet here on OLR. Check it out.

1252
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

1253
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And this has to do with, remember last week it came up that the PSP 4000 was on its way out.

1254
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:18,000
This coming from an advertisement that ran in a magazine that showed that this upcoming, I think, LittleBigPlanet thing was going to work on PSP 1000, 2000, 3000, the GO, and the OMG, what is this PSP 4000?

1255
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Well, by the way, they've come out and said, of course, deny, deny, deny.

1256
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It's come out, apparently, that the Sony PSP 4000 mention was a mistake on their part.

1257
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
There is no new model of the PSP under construction.

1258
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Uh huh, sure, whatever you say, dude.

1259
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yes, just like they didn't have an icon or whatever like that that was also available on Sony's website as well that someone found by changing the file name or whatever of the PSP 3000 icon on there.

1260
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
The 4000, oh look, it shows up.

1261
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Also, Sony came out and said, oh yeah, this is not true, and then the company that put out the ad said, oh yeah, this is not true, but come on, if they were really going to put it out, and this company leaked it out, wouldn't they be telling the company, deny everything!

1262
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Yeah, I know, the response coming here is like, I don't know, I don't know what you're talking about, crazy people, 4000!

1263
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Whether they do or not, let me put it this way, it's not going to be significant either way, so...

1264
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Alright, Sony, you're not coming out with a 4000, I will pretend to be surprised when you announce the 4000.

1265
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Just like with the Go.

1266
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
We're not doing a UMD Listio PSP with a sliding screen, that's preposterous!

1267
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Oh, by the way, the PSP Go is coming out now.

1268
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Here comes E3, lol gotcha!

1269
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Oh, 4000, you didn't see that one coming, no!

1270
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I think they should name it the 4001 just to spite everybody.

1271
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Sony, if you're listening, seriously, that is how you could get the last laugh.

1272
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Because we all know you're doing it now, just suck it up.

1273
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Name it the PSP 4001.

1274
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
And lol.

1275
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Alright, we're going to take some time here on the show to respect the classics.

1276
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It is time for the very last classic game of the week of the decade.

1277
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
No, this segment will be back in 2010, of course it will.

1278
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But this is a chance for Dark Soccer to dig through the gaming archives and pick a game from Gaming gesture here that she says,

1279
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Damn it, you ungrateful kids these days in your newfangled 360s and PS3s,

1280
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
you need to go play the games we used to play back in my day.

1281
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
And then she'll run over you with her walker, right?

1282
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I went, no, I went for Epic Old School Awesome.

1283
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Alright, so what is the Epic Old School Awesome video game of the week?

1284
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
The video game of the week is Salamander.

1285
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I'm pretty sure I haven't done Salamander yet.

1286
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I don't think you have either.

1287
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Which is a shame.

1288
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Well, then here is a little clip of Salamander.

1289
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Let's listen to the intro.

1290
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Pick it up for multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple.

1291
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Pick it up for a fourth, pick it up for Ripple Waker.

1292
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Which is the arcade version.

1293
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Now what is this Dark Soccer?

1294
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
This is just Life Force, right?

1295
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Actually, yes, Life Force is the name it came out with in North America.

1296
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So it's a spinoff from the Gradia series.

1297
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And it actually switches between horizontal and vertically scrolling areas.

1298
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So you've got kind of a little bit of both.

1299
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It also has a more simplified power-up system, too.

1300
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And you can play two-player co-op, which is great.

1301
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And that's in all of the stages, by the way.

1302
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,000
So Player 1 is the Vic Viper, and Player 2 is the Lord British.

1303
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And actually, did you know that there's a Salamander anime?

1304
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Wait, they really called one of the ships the Lord British?

1305
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Yeah.

1306
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Like the same guy who did Ultima Lord British?

1307
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I don't know.

1308
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Yeah, because when I hear Lord British, I think it's the dude who did Ultima back in the day.

1309
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,000
At any rate, well, you've got the Vic Viper and Lord British.

1310
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,000
And you play through six stages, and like I said, it alternates between horizontal and vertical.

1311
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You can actually continue from where you left off upon death instead of the checkpoint version that Gradius has.

1312
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You do not have any continues in Salamander's mode when you play single,

1313
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,000
but you have two continues in two-player mode, though you can actually change it in the settings.

1314
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
You also have different power-ups, like I said.

1315
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And you just pick up the capsule that you want of the power-up instead of selecting it like you do in Gradius.

1316
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
You know, how you can pick a double or let them save up.

1317
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
By the way, this is the most epic beating of this boss ever.

1318
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I was going to say, whoever's doing this playthrough here off this YouTube, it's user Succula.

1319
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
S-U-C-C-U-L-L-A is the YouTuber we're looking at here in the studio right now where the music's coming from.

1320
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Epic! This person knows what the fuck they're doing with this game. They know where it's at.

1321
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Well, on top of that, just like any of the Gradius games, especially with the bosses,

1322
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:29,000
there are little hidey places that you can go to and ways to lure the boss or whatever to where you need it to be.

1323
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And if I'm right, I think this is a one-playthrough beating of this game, which is really freaking difficult.

1324
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I love the laser. That was my favorite weapon.

1325
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I just freaking love Life Force on the NES.

1326
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I mean, I realize it has its roots different places, but I remember it as Life Force on the NES.

1327
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Well, I've got it.

1328
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Rob, if you want to play it?

1329
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Oh yeah, I know. I remember seeing it in the vault.

1330
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I just kind of, you know, I like the voice in this one, but I miss the double, you know, option and all that.

1331
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Or speed up, you know, but anyway.

1332
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:10,000
So you've got different backgrounds, you have star fields, you've got all kinds of different stuff.

1333
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:19,000
There's actually some big differences between the Japanese version and the European version and Life Force.

1334
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:31,000
The Japanese and European versions are pretty much the same except the American version changes the plot to the game by having some opening text

1335
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:38,000
where you're actually going inside a giant alien life form to fight off bacteria.

1336
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And so the star fields from Salamander were actually changed to kind of a web background so that it looks more organic.

1337
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I'm sure you remember that, Rob, don't you?

1338
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yes.

1339
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Power ups have different names. You have speed up becoming hyperspeed, missile becoming struck to missile, the ripple laser becoming pulse laser, and force field becoming shield.

1340
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
OMG, I love the fire level.

1341
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yeah.

1342
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Sorry, they're in stage three right now on their epic play through and oof, I love the fire level.

1343
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
There should be a link to level four, and actually level four, Rob, I wish you would have placed at the beginning of that.

1344
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
There should be this Saturn note.

1345
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Sure, you want to skip ahead a little bit here? We'll get to the fourth one.

1346
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Yeah, but this music you'll recognize from B-Mania.

1347
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Okay.

1348
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
That music right now was in the song under B-crush music.

1349
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Nice.

1350
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And actually stage four has my favorite music in the game.

1351
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:56,000
But some other differences, your power ups were modified a little bit to where you have the same for life force, the Japanese life force, you actually had the same power up as Gradius.

1352
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Some music was changed. You can, however, get the original Japanese version and the enhanced life force with the salamander deluxe pack that came out for PlayStation and Saturn and salamander portable on PSP.

1353
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So yeah, we have the NES version, which actually came out in 87.

1354
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:29,000
It actually, though, just took bits from salamander and life force to kind of make it a bit of a new concept in the game.

1355
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:40,000
It actually, we got the port for the NES, and it's exactly the same, except it doesn't have multiple endings like the Japanese one does, and it's just called life force.

1356
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
All of these use the Konami code, and the NES version is out on the virtual console.

1357
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,000
500 Wii points, go get it. There's an MSX version that's pretty different.

1358
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:04,000
You have different pilots for each of the ships, which if I do remember correctly, I think that it was from the MSX version that the anime was based off of.

1359
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It's been a long time since I've watched the anime. We've got it on DVD somewhere.

1360
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:16,000
There's also a PC Engine version. You actually have checkpoints in this one, faster anime animations.

1361
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Actually, they improved some of the music from the arcade version.

1362
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Ocean Software brought it out for the Spectrum Commodore in Amstrad in 1988.

1363
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:37,000
But the Commodore 64 version, Rob, you may be particularly happy to find out, was pretty much considered one of the best of the PC ports.

1364
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Of course, like I said, it came out on the PlayStation and Saturn.

1365
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:47,000
We got the Salamander Deluxe Pack, and also included with that was Salamander 2.

1366
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So that was Salamander, Life Force, and Salamander 2.

1367
01:14:50,000 --> 01:15:00,000
PSP, we got Salamander Portable, which had actually a few other kind of rare games in it.

1368
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It had Salamander, Life Force, Salamander 2, Zexix, I think that's what it's called? Zexix, Zexis? X-E-X-E-X?

1369
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

1370
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
It's a game I haven't played in a long time.

1371
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And the MSX version of Gradius 2, which came out, I think, as Nemesis 2.

1372
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Which has nothing to do with the arcade Gradius 2.

1373
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And for the record, Gradius 2 on PC Engine? Excellent.

1374
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Anyway, so yeah, here's actually the thing about the anime in here.

1375
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:38,000
There was an OAV, and it had to do with, it had the different characters in it.

1376
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:45,000
There was a character named Stephanie, and Lord British's ship was actually named after a character called Lord British.

1377
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So, it was Lord British's space destroyer.

1378
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I think it does have to do with the guy behind Ultima.

1379
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
At least some of the folks in chat are indicating too.

1380
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
That's really interesting, because he had nothing to do with Konami, I thought.

1381
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Yeah.

1382
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Well, there's also a couple good soundtracks too.

1383
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
There's a Salamander arcade soundtrack.

1384
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
There is the original Sound of Salamander, and Salamander again, Konami Kukeha Club.

1385
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Which, you know, they did a few games from that series.

1386
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I mean, a few soundtracks from that series.

1387
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So there you go.

1388
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Yummy.

1389
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Lots of Salamander-y things.

1390
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And also, I freaking love the cover of the soundtrack.

1391
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I mean, look at that and tell me that's not awesome.

1392
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I'm gonna link it in chatroom.

1393
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Yes, it's like a big demon face thing.

1394
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Kinda scary, actually, a little bit.

1395
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
It's like an evil snake.

1396
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Alright.

1397
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Which really has nothing to do with the Salamander, I guess.

1398
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Other than being, you know, reptiles, I guess, maybe?

1399
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Salamander.

1400
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Which is available on a variety of different systems, but if you want to play the original, go play the arcade version.

1401
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
You can find it if you know where to look.

1402
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1403
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
We're not done yet.

1404
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
In fact, we're gonna be back.

1405
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
We still have some rapid-fire news.

1406
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Your Twitter topics.

1407
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
And then we're gonna take a break from the news tonight and talk a little bit about what's happened this year.

1408
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Talk about our picks for game of the year.

1409
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And donuts.

1410
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And you wanna talk about donuts?

1411
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I just want one.

1412
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I want a donut, too.

1413
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I also want a pony.

1414
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Let's make dang, let's make dang, I have a pony, Rob.

1415
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Did I tell you that?

1416
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Okay, I have to share this.

1417
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Alright, yes.

1418
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
For our team builder, we did our annual present exchange.

1419
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And we were given these little pieces of paper that says, write down what you want.

1420
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So I'm like, you know, so that whoever gets our name doesn't buy us crap.

1421
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And I was like, okay, I want an Amazon gift card, or this gift card, or this gift card, or a pony.

1422
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
So someone, the person who got me, got me a toy pony.

1423
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
That's awesome.

1424
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And then a gift card to Barnes & Noble, so.

1425
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Nice.

1426
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
But I finally got my pony.

1427
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
That means I have to stop asking for one at restaurants.

1428
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
When they say, what can I get you tonight?

1429
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I need a pony.

1430
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Do you need anything else?

1431
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Yeah, I'd like a pony, please.

1432
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I'm going to have to stick with either the llama or the pygmy goat.

1433
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

1434
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in the year and the decade in review in just a few minutes.

1435
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, December the 27th of 2009,

1436
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
where we're taping the 350th episode of our show.

1437
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,000
And, yes, it's the very last Orange Lounge Radio of the decade, but we'll be back next week, as always, to do it all again.

1438
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And since it is the last OLR of the decade and it's been a little bit of a slow news week,

1439
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:36,000
we're going to take some time to reflect on our favorite games of the year and of the decade.

1440
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
But, meanwhile, we do have a few other news stories we want to get to real quick in a segment we call the Rapid Fire News.

1441
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And, of course, we'll get to your Twitter topics, too.

1442
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
If you haven't sent us your tweets yet, hurry up and do that, because we're going to get to those very soon,

1443
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
as soon as we get out our Rapid Fire News. So, Loki.

1444
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Yes. Well, if you're looking for something to do shortly after the new year, you can perhaps join the MAG beta,

1445
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:06,000
which was previously not available to everybody, but starting January 4th will be.

1446
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And you will be able to download it on the PlayStation Network.

1447
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Existing beta members will be able to update their files to prepare for the upcoming trial,

1448
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
which means that you shouldn't delete any of your MAG data if you are already in the beta.

1449
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:29,000
And, apparently, the beta is pretty short, though. It is only lasting a week until, well, slightly under a week, until January 10th.

1450
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:38,000
But you will be able to play 64-player sabotage matches and also 256-player domination matches.

1451
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,000
So, that's kind of neat. And then, of course, the end of the game will be coming out shortly after that.

1452
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
So, on the 26th.

1453
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Also, on the PlayStation Network will be coming Holy Invasion of Privacy Bad Man 2.

1454
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And what's kind of cool about it, as well, is that you will not only be able to get the sequel,

1455
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
but the first game will be included with it for free.

1456
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And that is, of course, if you get it via the PlayStation Network.

1457
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:15,000
No word, though, if, when they decide to put this out as an actual UMD, if the original game will appear on there, as well.

1458
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:23,000
But, at least right now, is kind of a nice bonus for, I guess, people who may own, like, the PSP Go, and that's their only option.

1459
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
So, that's kind of neat.

1460
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
And then, finally, in un-Sony PlayStation News,

1461
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Crackdown 2 is scheduled to be coming out the first half of 2010, which makes me all sorts of happy.

1462
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And no word exactly yet when it's going to be coming, but apparently it was revealed on Major Nelson's weekly podcast

1463
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:56,000
that Xbox's head, Aaron Greenberg, apparently is saying that Mass Effect 2, Splinter Cell Conviction, and Alan Wake,

1464
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:02,000
and apparently also Crackdown 2 are scheduled for the first part of the year.

1465
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
So, I guess Alan Wake isn't coming out later in the year like I had thought.

1466
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Probably second quarter, if I'd guess correctly.

1467
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Alright, well, some other games coming out before too long.

1468
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Resonance of Fate, some folks might be interested in this, is by TriAce.

1469
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,000
This is already available as a demo on the Japanese PlayStation Network or the Japanese Xbox 360.

1470
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
So, if you have a Japanese PSN account or you have a way of getting onto the...

1471
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I guess the Xbox is a little better now at blocking the non-Japanese stuff, but...

1472
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Eh, not very good at that.

1473
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Whatever you can do to get in there, you can do that to download that demo.

1474
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
If you haven't already heard about this game, it's coming out from SEGA is publishing it.

1475
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
It's kind of like a gunplay style RPG.

1476
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So, check that out, Resonance of Fate, now available in Japan or for those of you crafty folks over in other countries who know how to get in anyway.

1477
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
LoL, Eye of Judgment, yes, it's coming out on the PSP.

1478
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:00,000
But, no camera, no cards, and apparently, I'm not sure the UMD is really going to be there either.

1479
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Legends is just going to be on the PlayStation Store.

1480
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It's going to be there in the spring of 2010.

1481
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It'll have 300 digital cards, 30 that are unique on the PSP.

1482
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
No UMD release expected at this time.

1483
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It's only going to be a digital download.

1484
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,000
That doesn't mean it's only playable on the go, because remember, if you have a big enough memory card on the 3000...

1485
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
That's all you need.

1486
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Is that included in the bet?

1487
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Ooh, good question.

1488
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
No, and the reason why is because it's not as ridiculous as Eye of Judgment.

1489
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Whereas this, you know, is an actual game that can be played like a traditional game.

1490
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
It's not something that's, you know, a card game with this extra camera crap that's added on top of it.

1491
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I will give Loki that. I mean, let's face it.

1492
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Part of what made the first game so preposterous was the fact that, you know, you're playing this card game with a camera, and I think that's why he took the bet in the first place.

1493
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
PSP's deleting all that weird shit out.

1494
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Yeah, it's actually a game. It'd be almost like a translation of a Magic the Gathering game, whereas, you know, Eye of Judgment, I can imagine, would be played without the camera and all that extra crap.

1495
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Fair enough, guys. Let's just face it. Loki's never going to lose that bet. At least not in this decade.

1496
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It's never going to happen, period. They've stopped making the game.

1497
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Alright.

1498
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Silent Night is the name of a new expansion that came out on Quake Live this week.

1499
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And, as you can imagine, it makes everybody fit for the holidays.

1500
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Like, I guess if you want to shoot Santa Claus or one of his little helpers, you can kind of do that there.

1501
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:28,000
It's going to be there for two weeks, and it's a remake of a Team Arena Distance Screams. They're now calling it Silent Night.

1502
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So, don't expect any new weapons or any significant changes to gameplay.

1503
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:40,000
It's just like, you know, La La La, Winter Wonderland, etc., etc., candy canes and so forth for you to blow your friends away to.

1504
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Have fun with that.

1505
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

1506
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Some stuff.

1507
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Stuff like and such as?

1508
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Well, Sega's having like a big sale in their Wii Shop channel.

1509
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You should have some of the games like Sonic 1, 2, 3, Gunstar Heroes, Streets of Rage 2, PLPO2.

1510
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Basically, they're going to be five bucks until January 6th.

1511
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,000
So, each of them are three dollars less than usual, and I think they just want to make some money.

1512
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So, go buy them.

1513
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And as far as other stuff going on, there is a New Year's theme for free on Xbox Live, which it's pretty colorful.

1514
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Dan was using it for a little while. It has a big ball on top of the building. Ooh.

1515
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Also, they have some other things to go with the New Year that's supposed to, you have to pay for them, like the 2010 Avatar glasses.

1516
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And there's also the Deal of the Day stuff, like I believe it was the other day, it was Worms 2.

1517
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Some other stuff.

1518
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And then, last but not least, and actually this is I think the best news of all, is there is a country pack for Rock Band,

1519
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:08,000
but who cares about the country crap because there's also a Paul McCartney set in there as well.

1520
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:17,000
So, that's actually, it's actually December 29th is the country pack, which Alan Jackson's Good Time,

1521
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Cross Canadian Ragweed, Cry Lonely, Jason, Aldi and She's Country, Keith Urban, I Told You So.

1522
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
That seems to be like the only good thing in the whole packet.

1523
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Kenny Rogers, The Gambler, okay, maybe Kenny Rogers, classic.

1524
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Martina McBride, this one's for the girls, Shania Twain, Any Man of Mine, blah, blah, blah.

1525
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,000
But the Paul McCartney pack is going to be out on January 5th or January 7th for PS3 owners.

1526
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Haha, we'll get it first, Xbox, Xbox. You also get, for that set you get Band on the Run, the live, actually all these are live versions.

1527
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,000
This is from the Paul McCartney New York City concert.

1528
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
But there's Band on the Run, Jet, and Sing the Changes.

1529
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:09,000
All of those are going to be 160, sorry, Xbox points or 200 Wii points each.

1530
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And these are actually, there's no telling if they're going to be available for Lego Rock Band.

1531
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Alright.

1532
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I can't wait until January 5th.

1533
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
We'll start off the year with a bang, or a few guitar strums, whatever the case may be.

1534
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Let's get into some Twitter topics.

1535
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,000
We've been taking some of your submissions over Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R for some things we might have missed so far in the show.

1536
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And some random asked questions such as this first one from Blue Swim who tweets us,

1537
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:48,000
If you could bring only one celebrity who died during the O's decade back to life, who would it be and why?

1538
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:56,000
He continues on to tweet, I'd bring Heath Ledger back to life so he could reprise his role as the Joker in the new Batman movies again.

1539
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Gosh, I don't know. To think all the way back throughout the entire decade of the O's, that's a long time.

1540
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
A lot of people die, death just kind of happens, so I'm not sure.

1541
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
If you could bring back only one celebrity, he specifically said a celebrity.

1542
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Anybody that comes to mind for any of you?

1543
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I honestly, I'm drawing a blank.

1544
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I don't care.

1545
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yeah, it's kind of a weird thought.

1546
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:35,000
What if one of the celebrities that if they were suddenly back, if their very presence, alive, disrupted the entire time space continuum?

1547
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Or if they got brought back as a zombie.

1548
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:43,000
No, Rob. Then we'd have to shoot them in the head and we couldn't remember them in a nice way.

1549
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I would like to see, um, God, the name escapes me right now, a totally famous guy, the guy that was with the NRA, not from my cold dead hands.

1550
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Charlton Heston, was that it? I'd like to see him reanimated as a zombie. I think that's the celebrity from the O's.

1551
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I want to see Brittany Whatcherfuck come back as a zombie so we can shoot her.

1552
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Rude, rude, rude.

1553
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:15,000
You know, this is my whole thing. I understand mourning the loss of, like, someone's contribution, but you didn't know the person, you know?

1554
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Very good suggestion from chat. We have a couple people yelling out, Phil Hartman.

1555
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
That was a very tragic thing that happened.

1556
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:29,000
This is my whole thing. When people die, it's typically when they're supposed to.

1557
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Even if it might seem stupid, it's just, it happens when it happens, so I don't see any point in wishing for something that's not going to happen.

1558
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And since then, I really don't want to see anyone reanimated. I mean, just the whole zombie thing totally makes me want to puke.

1559
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Loki, was there something smartass you wanted to add?

1560
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,000
No, I just had to see when someone died, so just checking real quick.

1561
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Dammit!

1562
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
That was in 94. No John Candy, unfortunately.

1563
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I guess I'm going to have to go with my original thought, which was Michael Jackson, because I'd like to see him do his actual comeback.

1564
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And, you know, all sorts of fun that would be involved with that.

1565
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Alright, let's see. SSJ100Matt sent us this on Twitter, which is a link to a story.

1566
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Police followed an Xbox trail...

1567
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I take that back. I renege that.

1568
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I would like to see, um...

1569
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Oh, god, what's his name?

1570
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
The chatroom is correcting themselves, by the way. Phil Hartman died in 98.

1571
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Yeah, not Phil Hartman.

1572
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
The other guy, the other pitchman.

1573
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Billy Mays.

1574
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Hi, Billy Mays here.

1575
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
As a zombie.

1576
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
No, not as a zombie.

1577
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Did you see that episode of South Park? Brilliant, that show.

1578
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Anyhow, back to SSJ100Matt's tweet, thank you very much.

1579
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Sent us to a story from Lohud.com talking about police following an Xbox trail.

1580
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I guess because this guy in the Bronx was playing with a stolen Xbox 360 game system,

1581
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,000
it led them to a stash of stolen property, 200 car break-ins, and a couple of burglaries.

1582
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
They were very excited to recover all this.

1583
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
They went to... Oh, I love when they give the address in the story.

1584
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It was 4064 Laconia Avenue in the Bronx is where all this stuff was hiding, apparently.

1585
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,000
They got a search warrant. They traced through Microsoft and the ISP where this stolen Xbox was being played from,

1586
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,000
and it led them to a GPS system, laptop computers, and all this stuff.

1587
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:43,000
It looks like all this stuff was retrieved from 22-year-old Jeremiah Gilliam's bedroom.

1588
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
To Jeremiah Gilliam, we say, uh-huh.

1589
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Next time, don't be stupid.

1590
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Stealing things is pretty stupid in the first place, but then when you go and play with the stolen goods on the internet,

1591
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
that just makes you stupid or stupid.

1592
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
But let's face it, you're pretty stupid when you're stealing shit in the first place.

1593
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
That makes someone extra stupid.

1594
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
He probably wouldn't think that they would be tracking the system,

1595
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and it's almost likely that they wouldn't know what the system serial number and that kind of stuff was,

1596
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
but apparently they were able to track that via history and stuff like that.

1597
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Dedication to them for trying to get it back to the Xbox 360.

1598
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,000
We got a link from DJ Rama S on Twitter. He's linking us to another local New York thing.

1599
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
This is coming from Gizmodo, which is kind of interesting.

1600
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
It has to do with the iPhone, which some would argue is pretty much a gaming device in this day and age.

1601
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Apparently, the iPhone is not purchasable on AT&T's website if you use a New York City zip code,

1602
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:46,000
because according to a rep at, I guess, online, New York is not ready for the iPhone.

1603
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,000
You've heard about all these types of complaints where in New York City they can't handle the iPhone bandwidth.

1604
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Calls are getting dropped left and right and all this crazy stuff, so yikes.

1605
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:03,000
But their 3G is better. Their commercials say so. Am I to believe that Luke Wilson is lying to me?

1606
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I can't handle that. That's shocking that they would misrepresent themselves like that.

1607
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Just to point out, though, Gizmodo kind of continues to say that, hey, San Francisco also has a lot of problems,

1608
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,000
and you can still get an iPhone in San Francisco, so why New York is being singled out, who knows.

1609
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I think it's probably just some type of weird, creepy bug.

1610
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I don't think AT&T is going to acknowledge that this has any weight to it whatsoever.

1611
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
But apparently, also, Tigerclaw wants to add in our chat room.

1612
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:42,000
You can still go into a phone and get a, or, sorry, still go into a phone, still go into a store and get the phone that way.

1613
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
A little strange.

1614
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Anyhow, also going to some other news stories that were submitted.

1615
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Ray Ayanami sends us this link to Ketsuie, was announced for the Japanese Xbox 360s at what's called the Cave Festival.

1616
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
So this is a shooting game.

1617
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Ketsuie Kizuna Jigoku Tachi Extra is coming out on the 360.

1618
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:16,000
That'll cost you about $50, and it's another shmup that's coming to the Xbox 360, which has been getting a lot of those.

1619
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,000
But you can see some screenshots online at this shmups.system11.org web forum,

1620
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:27,000
where they actually show people playing at Akihabara at the Cave Festival this new game.

1621
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And there's even some footage on the internets, but there's a lot of background noise.

1622
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I don't want to play that for you right now.

1623
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
A couple stories coming to us from Tigerclaw305, who is sending us some stories about, let's see,

1624
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Timegate has sued South Peak for royalties and breach of contract.

1625
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Apparently this is the folks who developed Section 8, Timegate Studios.

1626
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
They have sued South Peak because of a breach of contract.

1627
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Apparently the publisher is withholding royalty payments and violates the deal with a PS3 porting deal with a Russian company.

1628
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
My gosh.

1629
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Let's see, Timegate wants compensatory damages.

1630
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,000
According to the report, South Peak says that because they got in 2008 Gamecock,

1631
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:16,000
it exempts it from some of the specifics of the original agreement.

1632
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
So yet more legal troubles.

1633
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
It'll be settled out of court. They always are.

1634
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
That's how those things go, yeah?

1635
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
That's what'll happen.

1636
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Let's see, also what's also very interesting, the CEO of 3D Realms has teased a Duke Nukem resurgence.

1637
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Oh God, here we go again.

1638
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Apparently numerous Duke Nukem games are in various stages of development.

1639
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Gosh, does that include Duke Nukem Forever?

1640
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Funny that you should mention Duke Nukem because remember there was supposed to be the PSP and DS versions that were coming out in September.

1641
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Oh, but those have been delayed.

1642
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Just like Duke Nukem.

1643
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Now I want to point out the CEO of 3D Realms did go out of his way to point out Duke Nukem Forever was not technically cancelled.

1644
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Yes, we released the initial team, but that doesn't correlate to the demise of the project.

1645
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Great.

1646
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
So this will be now what our third decade of Duke Nukem Forever rumors we're going to get into.

1647
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Goody goody.

1648
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Our good friend Marin Marvel has tweeted us and said,

1649
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
What do you guys think about the Blizzard Authenticator?

1650
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I think it's a really good idea. I hate to say it.

1651
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I had my account hacked and I will never undo the Authenticator because of it.

1652
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Especially if you're an iPhone or iTouch user, it's free.

1653
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,000
And to get a free pet out of it, and even if you don't have an iPhone or an iTouch, it's like $6.50 for the keychain.

1654
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Which, you know, considering they're also charging $10 for a pet, it's not a bad deal and it does keep your account relatively safe.

1655
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I think it's unfortunate that Blizzard won't do more against these gold spammers and things, but unfortunately what they're doing,

1656
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:02,000
they're hacking a lot of American accounts and going into the games and rolling level one characters and doing all the shouts and so forth.

1657
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
How well does the app work?

1658
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Huh?

1659
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
How well does the app work?

1660
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Never had a problem with it. Pretty much all you do, you boot it up and it brings you up the code right away.

1661
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
But is that one that you have to pay for?

1662
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
No. It's a free app.

1663
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Well then I'll just download it right now.

1664
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Yeah, so I mean, honestly, if you have the iPhone or iTouch, there's no reason not to have it.

1665
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Except for, you know, if you're away from that device a lot, like especially if you're an iTouch user, you're not always with your iTouch.

1666
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
But if you're with your iPhone, I mean, I have my phone with me pretty much everywhere I go.

1667
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So, I see no reason not to have it there.

1668
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:38,000
But I just think it sucks that the burden is on me to prevent my account from getting hacked.

1669
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I do think some of the burden, I mean, I am, you know, you can point and laugh at me all you want for having my account hacked.

1670
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
But I like to think I'm a pretty intelligent web user.

1671
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I know the basics about phishing and websites.

1672
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,000
And I know, I do not to this day know how my account got hacked.

1673
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And it kind of freaks me out because I hope they didn't get my email or other things as well.

1674
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I just, I wish Blizzard would sue people.

1675
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I wish they would just start blocking IPs from maybe regions that are in America.

1676
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I mean, I hate to say it, but you know what?

1677
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
There is WoW localized for other regions.

1678
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,000
So, maybe it's time to start locking players out from certain regions.

1679
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I hate to say it, but if that's the way we're going to prevent.

1680
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
But, you know, you can always IP spoof and all this other crazy stuff.

1681
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
But I just wish the burden wasn't on us.

1682
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
But hey, it's free.

1683
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Lastly, one more question from Jazajazz on Twitter.

1684
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Where do you think games are headed in the new year?

1685
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Digital distribution is going to be huge in the next decade.

1686
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I think a lot of these game stores are going to have to change their business model.

1687
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Or there's a lot to lose in the coming decade.

1688
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I think digital distribution is going to be huge in the upcoming next few years.

1689
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I think that's where games are headed, online.

1690
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Low-key Dark Soccer?

1691
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I agree. Honestly, we've been seeing it happen more and more.

1692
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Especially since Sony has been really adopting it.

1693
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Yeah, probably more digital distribution.

1694
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
But I don't really think things are going to change too much.

1695
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
They're probably going to try to push 3D.

1696
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Because that's the next big thing.

1697
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And now with the two...

1698
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I don't really see...

1699
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Truly next-gen consoles.

1700
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I found the Wii's kind of recycled hardware, if you ask me.

1701
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
But now they're coming out with their 3D controllers.

1702
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
So that's really going to be the pushes for 3D.

1703
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
And you're going to see almost a new console generation being formed from this.

1704
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Yeah, I honestly would not expect to see all new consoles until 2013-14.

1705
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I mean, it's going to be a ways out.

1706
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Especially with these motion and stuff.

1707
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Except for Nintendo.

1708
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Unless...

1709
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I think Nintendo will have something very soon.

1710
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Unless this just flops and dies, you know.

1711
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
And I think from Nintendo, I don't think we're going to see anything really new.

1712
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
You know, it's probably just going to be an upgrade.

1713
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I want to point out some comments from our chat room on some of those tweets.

1714
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Misty wants to point out in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchreader.com

1715
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Fuck that, Rob.

1716
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
I keep my eye touch with me all the damn time and in my pocket at work.

1717
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Because due to some shit that happened around work last year,

1718
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I'm paranoid about my eye touch getting jacked.

1719
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Well, that's unfortunate.

1720
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
F you to those stupid people that caused you to be paranoid.

1721
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I get some people, yes, they do have their eye touch with them all the time.

1722
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
But I also know some people that, you know, they only have it at home or at work.

1723
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You know, they don't really carry it with them everywhere.

1724
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
So just...

1725
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
You know what your habits are.

1726
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
If you do have your eye touch with you all the time, then maybe the Blizzard thing is a good idea.

1727
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
SSJ100matt kind of jokes.

1728
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I don't know if this is a joke or real.

1729
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
But Blizzard banning IPs in Korea is an act of war, Rob.

1730
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I'm not saying ban Korea or whatever country you want to name from the games.

1731
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:54,000
But if you have a game that has US servers that's meant to be played by the US that's localized for the US,

1732
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Korea gets their own version of the games.

1733
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
WoW's been localized for China.

1734
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
WoW's out another...

1735
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
You know what I mean?

1736
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Unfortunately, if all the gold farming is coming from China, maybe it's time to put some restrictions down.

1737
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I think they also need to place some restrictions on, you know, who can do these shouts and chat and so forth.

1738
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Blizzard's done a really good job over the years, though.

1739
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I mean, let's face it.

1740
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Every time they evolve, the gold hackers and the gold farmers have to get a little smarter.

1741
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I don't want to make it sound like Blizzard's done nothing because they really have done a lot.

1742
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
They've gotten smart about how they do trial accounts and a lot of the various aspects of WoW.

1743
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:36,000
It just sucks that they just won't play hardball and start suing the pants off of some of these people that exploit their game.

1744
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
You know what I mean?

1745
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I just want to see some...

1746
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I want to see heads roll over my account getting hacked.

1747
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
All right.

1748
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
That's going to do it for the Twitter topics for tonight.

1749
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Let's talk about some of the year-end news.

1750
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:58,000
And we'll start off talking about some of our favorite games of the year and games you might call your game of the year.

1751
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:04,000
In chat room, we're taking your submissions as well, and I'll try to keep an eye on the Twitter, too, for those of you that can't be in chat.

1752
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
You know, what were some of your picks for the game of the year and why?

1753
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Usually, I find these game of the year picks to be a little silly because it's just one person's opinion.

1754
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
So keep that in mind as we talk about our favorite games of the year.

1755
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
We're just gamers.

1756
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
We like what we like.

1757
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And this is our opinion for the game that you think was the most important game of 2009.

1758
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I'll start with Loki tonight.

1759
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
What do you think, Loki?

1760
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
What do you think were...

1761
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
And if you have a couple, go ahead.

1762
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
But what do you think overall was probably the biggest game of 2009?

1763
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Of 2009?

1764
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Well, probably Call of Duty Tomorrow Warfare 2 was, but I didn't play that game.

1765
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:44,000
So the game I liked, or at least just if I was going to vote based on how much I played it, I'd say Grand Theft Auto.

1766
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Mainly the two expansions because that's what I was ending up playing.

1767
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:56,000
And, you know, I think it's kind of neat because, you know, whereas before we wouldn't really see expansions for Grand Theft Auto.

1768
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:01,000
We'd just see a couple other games kind of using the same engine, and still we may see that relatively soon.

1769
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:08,000
But it was kind of neat to kind of expand upon the story and kind of bring different perspectives to it and whatnot.

1770
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
And it was fun.

1771
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,000
They kind of brought back some of the old stuff that I thought should have been in there in the first place.

1772
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
A lot of the over-the-top stuff because they want to keep it grounded in reality, whatever.

1773
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:22,000
So that was kind of, you know, my favorite of the year.

1774
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Other important games, I think DJ Hero was pretty big.

1775
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:31,000
You know, kind of a different take on the whole music game genre, and I kind of like that.

1776
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I thought DJ Hero was horrifically underrated, and it's kind of sad.

1777
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Like, you know, a lot of people were writing it off as a failure.

1778
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:44,000
But, you know, in looking at my Twitter and my Facebook, it seems like DJ Hero was a big-time Christmas present that was showing up for a lot of people.

1779
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
So maybe it'll find a second life of sorts as we get in past the holidays.

1780
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And also some of the other underrated Wii games, you know, more of the mature stuff like Madworld.

1781
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
You know, I love that game. I thought it was pretty fun.

1782
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And it's just, you know, unfortunately a lot of the mature stuff doesn't do well.

1783
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Especially when they don't put a lot of press behind it.

1784
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I mean, there are some commercials and stuff, but I don't think the mature audience is really that big right now on the Wii, which is too bad.

1785
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Because a lot of people have kind of given up on it and just went elsewhere.

1786
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
So I'd have to, you know, vote that.

1787
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
And really, unfortunately, I didn't play a lot of other stuff.

1788
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I'm sure Borderlands would be on my list if I had actually played that this year.

1789
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
And there's still time, but, you know, it's unfortunate.

1790
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
But, you know, that was probably a good one.

1791
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I'm sure a little bit of, I'm sure Infinite would have been on there, because that was supposed to be pretty good.

1792
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I just didn't get a chance to play it.

1793
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Prototype was alright, but that was kind of crap.

1794
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Street Fighter IV was kind of cool.

1795
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I'm not really huge into the Street Fighter stuff, but that was kind of neat.

1796
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
And, you know, playing Tatsunoko versus Capcom won the import.

1797
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
That was actually pretty sweet, and I'd say that's going to be a good one this year.

1798
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
And of course, you know, just we got to joke and say it.

1799
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:13,000
President Cat is very strange and absolutely a weird game to come out.

1800
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
But I think it could do well over here.

1801
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I mean, seriously, there's so much crap that comes out in the Wii.

1802
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I don't understand why anybody couldn't take a chance.

1803
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:27,000
And, you know, there are companies like this, Graffiti Entertainment, Axis Game Localization.

1804
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I mean, fuck, they're bringing over Choniki.

1805
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Come on, man. Take the gamble.

1806
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Alright, Loki's named about 20 different games for his game of the year.

1807
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
What do you think, DarkSakura? Is your list as long?

1808
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Probably not, given that, I mean, Sims 3 came out, and that was big for me.

1809
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Because I actually really enjoy Sims 3.

1810
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I haven't gotten World Adventures, but that was, you know, especially now they've got the build a world thing for Sims 3.

1811
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
That's actually pretty cool.

1812
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:02,000
And the fact that, of course, it didn't take too long for all of the modders to start putting out their own hacks to the game,

1813
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
and their own items and stuff, so it was pretty cool.

1814
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
And of course, I love building houses.

1815
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Other stuff, yeah, I've really been enjoying Danplay, Borderlands.

1816
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I can't play it because I get, you know, motion sick.

1817
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I've got my Silent Hill that I haven't played yet.

1818
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I'm going to say, though, Street Fighter IV was really big for me, especially getting Sakura in the home release made me happy.

1819
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Because then I could, you know, kick Dan's butt and be happy about it.

1820
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Of course, though, we got it, like, right around the time my hand was really in bad shape.

1821
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:42,000
And I have to also second Tatsunoko vs Capcom, because, again, big Tatsunoko fan for me.

1822
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Big Capcom fan.

1823
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
So the two together was just like a squeegasm in the process.

1824
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:59,000
And I remember sitting on the couch and being in absolute pain and still insisting on trying to beat the stupid bouncing ball in Tatsunoko vs Capcom.

1825
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I'm like, look, they're playing the Gachomon music.

1826
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Look, they're playing the Gachomon music.

1827
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I'm so happy.

1828
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
You know, big, big, uh, squeegasm for me.

1829
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Are you looking forward to the localization next year?

1830
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Are you like, no thanks, Cas.

1831
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Heck yeah.

1832
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
As long as they leave most of it in Japanese.

1833
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Alright.

1834
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I'm sorry, they've got the voice actors.

1835
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
How can you go wrong with that?

1836
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Um, let's see.

1837
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I would say there's probably three games I would bestow the Game of the Year honor upon.

1838
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
One of them you'll say, okay, yeah, I see that.

1839
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Because it's something everybody else named.

1840
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Uh, one of them you'll say, dammit, Rob, why'd you have to say that?

1841
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
And then the other one you're going to go, LOL, what the fuck?

1842
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,000
The first one I would say Dark Soccer and Loki also both said Street Fighter IV, I think was one of the best games that came out this year.

1843
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I think it was an awesome upgrade to Street Fighter II, because we'll just ignore the third one.

1844
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Uh, but I think, you know, it kind of brought a lot of people back to that series, including myself.

1845
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
And I thought some of the integration they did online was really great.

1846
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
And, uh, you know, it came out kind of early in the year, so I think a lot of people forget it was one of the games this year.

1847
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
But I think it did great, great things for fighting games this year.

1848
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
And, uh, you know, it's just going to continue on to next year when Super Street Fighter IV comes out.

1849
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Very interesting, it's the one game all three of us named, so maybe you'd want to say that as the collective Game of the Year.

1850
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I don't know.

1851
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Um, let's see, also, I would say New Super Mario Bros. Wii is definitely worthy of the praise of Game of the Year.

1852
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
For some of the same reasons.

1853
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:29,000
And it pains me when Nintendo does this, because, dammit, I mean, Nintendo...

1854
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:35,000
They so rarely are putting out these games that are so appealing to the hardcore, if you will, gamers.

1855
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:41,000
But then there's that one diamond in the rough that comes out, and I mean, like, literally sparkling diamond.

1856
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
And New Super Mario Bros. Wii was kind of that game.

1857
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,000
It had a lot in there for veteran gamers like myself, you know, the nostalgia factor is obviously huge.

1858
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
But that nostalgia factor carries over to the basic gamers.

1859
01:47:52,000 --> 01:48:00,000
They really did get it right in, you know, a lot of people don't want to touch Mario Galaxy, as great of a game as that is,

1860
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
because it's like, what? 3D Mario? Can't control? Ah, a little weird.

1861
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
But New Super Mario Bros. Wii kind of takes Mario back to its roots.

1862
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
And it's like, oh, jump on Google.

1863
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
That was pretty funny. That was pretty fun.

1864
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And it's absolute chaos getting a bunch of people together.

1865
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
It is hell in four player mode, but I still kind of applaud Nintendo for making it work, so to speak.

1866
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
So I thought it was an awesome game.

1867
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
It brought a lot of gamers back to gaming.

1868
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:34,000
And you know, sometimes you want to hate Nintendo for this, but like I said, it's a diamond in the rough of the Wii software that's out there.

1869
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Here's my LOL what the fuck pic for game of the year.

1870
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
And I honestly think it's deserving.

1871
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
And a lot of people are forgetting that this game is from this year.

1872
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,000
But it is absolutely one of the best things to happen to gaming this year.

1873
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,000
1 versus 100 on Xbox Live, I think, absolutely deserves the accolade of one of the games of the years.

1874
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
It's something new we haven't really seen before-ish.

1875
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I mean, unless you want to go back to the old days of the Berkley Entertainment on the PC and Acrophobia and all this stuff.

1876
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
You know, we haven't really seen anything quite like it, this whole like game show thing.

1877
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
It's a lot of fun to actually play with friends.

1878
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,000
It really appeals to a broad base of people.

1879
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
It's kind of neat that you're actually playing for real money.

1880
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I mean, it's such a different type of game.

1881
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I give it such props for being new, different, and fun.

1882
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Best of all, if you happen to be an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, it's free.

1883
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Or even the silver folks got it free for a little while.

1884
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
So, you know, it's fair to say that this game was free.

1885
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
So, how can you go wrong?

1886
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I think 1 versus 100 in some ways is the game of the year.

1887
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,000
And for whoever was asking earlier where our game is going in the future,

1888
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I'll bet you see some more stuff like this, the interactive stuff.

1889
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
I think it's going to be very cool to see how that plays out in the next decade.

1890
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
So, check that out.

1891
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
So, those were our games of the year.

1892
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
What about you guys in our chat room?

1893
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Some of you guys were naming some of your things here.

1894
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
GameGuru says, what's wrong with Street Fighter 3?

1895
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Well, okay, it's pandering to the base.

1896
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
But still, I don't want to buy Street Fighter 4 when Super Street Fighter 4 is coming out.

1897
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Yeah, that was unfortunate that Super Street Fighter 4 was announced kind of soon

1898
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
because, you know, it devalued the original.

1899
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
But, you know, we had Street Fighter 2 and Super Street Fighter 2,

1900
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
so I guess it's nothing too unheard of there.

1901
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Let's see.

1902
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Tigerclaw says, game of the year for me is Batman Arkham Asylum.

1903
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
You know, that did get a lot of props.

1904
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Very good storytelling in that game.

1905
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
And certainly, panders to fans of Batman like in the comic form.

1906
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,000
They did a really good job with that game.

1907
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,000
They really did.

1908
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
You know, I really, really liked Harley in that game.

1909
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
You know, this is actually a game that convinced one of my friends to get an Xbox.

1910
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
It's really good storytelling.

1911
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
It was.

1912
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Sj100Matt says, from the sports side here, NHL 10.

1913
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Not only was it great, but it beat out Madden 10 for the best sports game at the VGAs.

1914
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
A hockey game beating out a football game? What?

1915
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Well, we also got a contribution from Marin, Beatles Rock Band.

1916
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Which, actually, I'm going to have to go with as well.

1917
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
But, you know, you should say that.

1918
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Of course.

1919
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Heart, heart, heart.

1920
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Beatles Rock Band was an excellent implementation.

1921
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
I'm still opting for DJ Hero as my music game of the year,

1922
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
but I do respect greatly Beatles Rock Band,

1923
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
and I think it was badly needed.

1924
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I think getting it out was a big achievement.

1925
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I think so, too.

1926
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,000
And just to get everybody on stage at E3 to announce it, that was epic.

1927
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Come on.

1928
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Having Yoko Ono, George Harrison's wife, McCartney, you know, Ringo Starr,

1929
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
all on stage at once, pretty awesome.

1930
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Pretty, pretty awesome.

1931
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Speaking of some of the things that happened this year,

1932
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
just kind of like trekking back,

1933
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
and it's kind of funny to look back sometimes on what happened in previous months,

1934
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
kind of see where that put us this year.

1935
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Just quickly going through some of the big things that happened this year.

1936
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
If you look at January and some of the things that happened there,

1937
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
a lot of restructuring and layoff news.

1938
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
You know, Sony did some restructuring and announced a 2.9 billion loss.

1939
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Microsoft at once thought Invisible Company laid off 5,000 people.

1940
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
That both happened in January.

1941
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Sadly, layoffs were a big thing this year.

1942
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
What do you guys think?

1943
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Are we past that, or are we going to continue to see more layoffs?

1944
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
What's going to happen to all these people that lost their jobs in 09?

1945
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
It'll slow down, probably, as far as layoffs go,

1946
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
and probably hirings, even.

1947
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
You probably see a lot of these guys that got laid off from these companies

1948
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
forming their own smaller companies.

1949
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
That seems to be the trend.

1950
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
And interesting, because maybe that indie development

1951
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,000
is going to lead to more digital distribution, as we talked about before.

1952
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Let's see.

1953
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Moving on to February, some of the things that happened there,

1954
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
unfortunately, more losses.

1955
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
EA cut back 11% of their workforce.

1956
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Activision, Blizzard, I don't know how the hell they lost money,

1957
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
but they sure did.

1958
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,000
And they did not do any huge layoffs, though, at that time.

1959
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Also, though, what I thought was interesting,

1960
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Wii Fit sold 777,000 copies in January.

1961
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
That news would then roll over to February.

1962
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:18,000
So, you know, Wii Fit was obviously a big piece of gaming in 2009

1963
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
that none of us named in our game of the year.

1964
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Has Wii Fit been good or bad for gaming?

1965
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
What do you guys think?

1966
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I wouldn't say in terms of gaming,

1967
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:34,000
but it's definitely been good in terms of making exercise enjoyable.

1968
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Wii Fit is not something that I really consider to be a game.

1969
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I consider it to be a tool.

1970
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,000
It's a fun tech demo, is really what it is.

1971
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
And I think a lot of stuff that Nintendo has done

1972
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
could be kind of considered a tech demo.

1973
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Hell, Wii Sports and Wii Play,

1974
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
a lot of that stuff was just a tech demo for the Wii,

1975
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
and it ended up being pretty successful.

1976
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I think, if anything, Wii Sports hurt gaming more than Wii Fit did.

1977
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Wii Fit, eh, who cares?

1978
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
You know, it's an exercise game that comes out.

1979
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I don't have to play that.

1980
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Wii Sports, oh, look, it's like a party game.

1981
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Every fucking game that seems to come out on the Wii nowadays

1982
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:13,000
is almost like a party game because Wii's the party console.

1983
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Yeah, great.

1984
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
You know what, though?

1985
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I would like some other types of games on there

1986
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,000
because there's at least one party game coming out every freaking week.

1987
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Enough is enough.

1988
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
You want to see a party-free 2010?

1989
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I would like to see them actually go back to what worked before.

1990
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
You don't necessarily need to change.

1991
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Make some good side-scrolling games.

1992
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Make some good, you know, just games that utilize the technology.

1993
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Everything doesn't have to be a party game.

1994
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Everything doesn't have to be a waggle fest.

1995
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Just do it what worked.

1996
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I mean, I don't understand it.

1997
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
We had a lot of games selling back in the day

1998
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,000
of the Super Nintendo and stuff, and even the NES and whatnot,

1999
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
and they didn't really rely on a lot of gimmicks.

2000
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Made mode 7, but I mean, come on, it wasn't that bad.

2001
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Moving into March, some of the big news from March

2002
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
was Game Developers Conference happened in March,

2003
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
and some of the big things that came out of Game Developers Conference

2004
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
was the DS Zelda game that we ended up getting a little later in the year.

2005
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Also, OnLive and their on-demand game streaming.

2006
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Do you remember hearing about this, OnLive?

2007
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Do you think OnLive is something to take seriously,

2008
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
this whole on-demand game streaming in the future?

2009
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
It was supposed to be top-tier games from EA, Take-Two, Ubisoft.

2010
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
They will be on your PC and soon TVs later in the year,

2011
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
although of course that never happened.

2012
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,000
What do you think about OnLive in the future of that?

2013
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I think that if it works like they say it is, then it's a good thing.

2014
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I mean, it'll be pretty popular because everybody's really digging

2015
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
into streaming stuff nowadays, especially with Netflix

2016
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
and other video services out there.

2017
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Steam as a digital distribution platform has done pretty well,

2018
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
so combining the two is not a bad thing.

2019
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I think, though, reality is going to be slightly different than what's promised.

2020
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I mean, it seems very hard to fathom that something like that is going to work.

2021
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
But hey, if it does, whatever the technology may be, then more power to them.

2022
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
And I'm sure if it works out for them,

2023
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:23,000
then the big three will probably try to find a way to do it themselves.

2024
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Some of the news as we moved into April.

2025
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Will Wright left EA.

2026
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I kind of forgot that that happened,

2027
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
but that's when an epic designer leaves a big company like that.

2028
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
You always kind of wonder what the heck is going on there.

2029
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Also, the disappointing sales of Chinatown Wars.

2030
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Remember how in 2008, Nintendo got up there at E3 and said,

2031
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
hey, we've got a Grand Theft Auto game coming to the DS.

2032
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,000
It's going to be awesome, and it's going to try to get some of those hardcore players on our unit.

2033
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
It sold under 90,000 units in March, which is considered a disappointment.

2034
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
What happened with Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars?

2035
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I didn't really care for it that much,

2036
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,000
and it's mainly because it's kind of going back to the old school game.

2037
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I think we remember back in the day the old school one was pretty fun.

2038
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,000
But now that we have the newer ones, it's like,

2039
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,000
well, it's cool and all, but I would have rather had something more like the PSP.

2040
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And there seems to be like, oh, well, you can't do that on the Nintendo system.

2041
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
It's just not powerful enough.

2042
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
But then we have Cop the Recruit that comes out.

2043
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
It looks just like the old PSP Grand Theft Auto games.

2044
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
And we have to go back to Rockstar and go, what the fuck?

2045
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
So you can do it, but you just didn't.

2046
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
You didn't really put the effort into it.

2047
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Instead, you made these little mini games that involved the DS stylus.

2048
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I guess that's neat and all, but it just really didn't hook me in like the other ones.

2049
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
I guess my standards have gone up since one and two.

2050
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Well, not a lot happened in May, but then we got into June,

2051
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,000
and June was, of course, the big E3 expo.

2052
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
And at E3 was when we got a hell of a lot of news,

2053
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
including the unveiling of Project Natal from Microsoft,

2054
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Sony showing their ice cream cone controller,

2055
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
whatever that thing is supposed to be for their motion sensing,

2056
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:10,000
and then Nintendo showing the Wii Vitality sensor.

2057
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Looking back on E3 this year, any kind of thoughts about how the show went

2058
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
or kind of where we are now six months later?

2059
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I think everyone was still pooping themselves over Natal.

2060
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I think that Nintendo disappointed once again, you know,

2061
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,000
not as bad as the year prior, but this year was kind of pathetic.

2062
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And I'm sorry, the Wii Vitality sensor.

2063
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Okay, remember with the Wii Fit Balance Board, it's like,

2064
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,000
oh, it's going to revolutionize how you do these exercise games and stuff.

2065
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
And great, now we have a bunch of these games

2066
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
that have the Balance Board sensors in there,

2067
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
and we use it, and okay, that's great.

2068
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Not a real huge step, I guess, but it's neat nonetheless.

2069
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,000
The Vitality sensor, I'm sorry, I don't see what the point is of this.

2070
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I just don't get it, and I know they're going to have that stupid game,

2071
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Wii Relax, come out.

2072
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Great, you'll sell some copies of that, but I think it's crap.

2073
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
What happened to that Metroid game that Teen Ninja was doing?

2074
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I mean, we saw a neat little preview of E3,

2075
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
and it's literally not a damn thing since then.

2076
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Yeah, it's promises of stuff that will come later on, like next year.

2077
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I'll be surprised if that game comes out this year.

2078
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I will be surprised.

2079
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
2010, you mean?

2080
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Yeah, 2010.

2081
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I'll be surprised if it makes it out in 2010,

2082
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:32,000
but I don't know, it's just excuses and delays.

2083
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
A lot of the stuff, and they keep trying,

2084
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
it's almost like they're trying to grasp at, you know,

2085
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,000
they have like this really boring presentation,

2086
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
and they're trying to grasp at like the hardcore players are going like,

2087
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
fuck this, I'm out of here, you know.

2088
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I'm done with this new presentation.

2089
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,000
We got the games that you want.

2090
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
They're coming.

2091
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Don't worry, just be patient.

2092
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I got to play devil's advocate here, though, because of what I just said.

2093
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
One of the other things Nintendo revealed at E3 this year,

2094
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
which was not expected by any means, was New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

2095
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
which, I'm sorry, is one of the best games that came out this year.

2096
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
It really was.

2097
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Yeah, that's pretty sad that that's the best game that came out this year

2098
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,000
from Nintendo, a company that, you know, had really innovative games in the past.

2099
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
All have been, you know, really great titles,

2100
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
except recently some of their games that they released are kind of,

2101
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
eh, you know, whatever, I don't really care.

2102
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I mean, seriously, what did they release this year?

2103
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Let me think here.

2104
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,000
So we had Wii Fit Plus, which was basically just a port of Wii Fit,

2105
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
now with some added crap on there,

2106
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,000
and we're going to throw it in for a discount just to capitalize on Wii Fit again,

2107
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
because people may have forgotten about it.

2108
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
We had Wii Sports Resort, which comes with an extra sensor

2109
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,000
that really should have been in the Wii Remote to begin with,

2110
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
and kind of what they really promised with the Wii from the get-go,

2111
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
but, oh, we just couldn't do it.

2112
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Right.

2113
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
You just couldn't add that extra sensor in there because it would be too expensive,

2114
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
or you just want to sell some more peripherals later on.

2115
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Okay, great.

2116
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,000
So you repackaged Wii Sports, and we threw it back out there again.

2117
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Okay, then you have, you know, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which is fine.

2118
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
It's your traditional Mario Bros. game, which is really what a lot of people look for,

2119
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
because, you know, God forbid...

2120
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And it was great!

2121
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
It was a great game that came out this year.

2122
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Yeah, that, okay, and then Metroid Prime Trilogy,

2123
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
which was just a rehash of some old stuff.

2124
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Then they added the new Play Control series,

2125
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:26,000
which is basically ported GameCube games that they've added some Wii controls to.

2126
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Great! I'm glad you have the ability to port GameCube games and add Waggle to them.

2127
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Way to be innovative.

2128
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I'm sorry, it's just, you know, in looking at the first quarter slate for Nintendo,

2129
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:44,000
let's see, we have a remake of a couple Pokemon games.

2130
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
We have another Endless Ocean game, which, you know, the first one was kind of neat,

2131
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
but I don't think it really warranted a sequel.

2132
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:55,000
And then we have, let's see here, another cooking sim,

2133
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:01,000
which, to be honest, is exactly the same as the last cooking game that they had for Nintendo.

2134
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I kid you not, the descriptions are almost identical,

2135
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
except they changed the name of the game,

2136
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:10,000
you know, because some people might, you know, get fooled by that.

2137
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:15,000
And what do they have other than, you know, the Zelda game for the DS, which was kind of cool.

2138
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Let's see, they had some style simulation games,

2139
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
because God forbid there's not enough of those on the DS,

2140
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:25,000
you know, between Ubisoft and Dreamcatcher,

2141
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:28,000
there's so many damn games for girls.

2142
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
I mean, it just got lost in the fray right there.

2143
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
And a lot of things that they release,

2144
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I think Nintendo thinks that their name's going to sell these titles.

2145
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Well, that's not been the case.

2146
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Fossil Fighters? Hello.

2147
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:44,000
There's been other games that have been put out exactly the same as that.

2148
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
It's just they just don't get it,

2149
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
and I'm sure they're going to promise some more stuff,

2150
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
maybe Pikmin 3, and then everyone will shit their pants,

2151
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
because it's Pikmin 3, and it's going to come out.

2152
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
It's going to be exactly the same as Pikmin 2,

2153
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
which just was some extra shit,

2154
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:00,000
and people are going to buy into it because they're fucking cheap.

2155
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Well, we know Galaxy 2 is on the way, too.

2156
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
And I'm glad that New Super Mario Brothers,

2157
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
a completely original game,

2158
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:10,000
God forbid that it was like another New Super Mario Brothers game that came out on,

2159
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,000
oh, the DS. Oh, that's right.

2160
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Very similar to that, except now we have four players,

2161
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,000
because it's a party game.

2162
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Oh, party, because that's so awesome.

2163
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:22,000
You can play a single-player mode, and it's still a rewarding experience, I think.

2164
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,000
And there are new power-ups and new things they do in it.

2165
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Oh, new power-ups.

2166
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:30,000
That's totally new for a Mario game, you bastard.

2167
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
New power-ups.

2168
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Oh, my God.

2169
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Oh, I take everything back that I said about Nintendo.

2170
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Well, if they have new power-ups in there, then God forbid, Game of the Year.

2171
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
And Super Mario Galaxy 2,

2172
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
yeah, I'm sure that'll be very different than Galaxy 1.

2173
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Oh, we added some different levels now.

2174
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Praise us.

2175
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
All the work's been done on the engine before,

2176
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
but now we have new levels and new gimmicks,

2177
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
and you're going to think, oh, my God, it's so awesome.

2178
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
And yell in that same little girly voice.

2179
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Maybe we'll get Twilight Princess 2.

2180
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
It'll be exactly the same as Twilight Princess 1,

2181
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
but it'll have some slightly new levels in it.

2182
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
You know there's going to be the Zelda...

2183
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Maybe they'll fuse them and do Majora's Princess.

2184
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
You know there's going to be the Zelda game.

2185
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
That's going to be the big thing they're going to unveil at E3 this year.

2186
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Mark my words, 2010 predictions.

2187
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
New Zelda will be the thing.

2188
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Nintendo tries to redeem themselves with this year.

2189
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
You know what's great about Nintendo, though?

2190
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Their fans are so dumb and so forgiving of everything that they do,

2191
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
they'll sell a million copies no matter what they do.

2192
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
They could shit in a box and call it Metroid

2193
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
and give it to you and you'd buy it because you're fucking stupid.

2194
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Way to go, folks.

2195
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:34,000
You know, anything that you want them to do correctly,

2196
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
they're never going to do anymore because, you know what,

2197
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
you'll buy their shit.

2198
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I'm sorry, I still stand by it.

2199
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
As much as you're calling it recycled garbage and all this stuff,

2200
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
if it's still a good game,

2201
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I think Mario Galaxy 2 has the potential to be really awesome

2202
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,000
because Galaxy 1 was great

2203
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
and if they just improve on that, it's going to get even better.

2204
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I mean, you can't say that they don't have sequels and rehash shit

2205
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
on the 360 and the PS3 as well.

2206
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Oh, they do. I call them out for it.

2207
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:06,000
We have a game that comes out every year that's a rehash of the last year's game.

2208
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
We call it Madden.

2209
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
And NBA Live.

2210
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
And NBA 2K.

2211
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
And Dance Dance Revolution.

2212
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
And Dance Dance Revolution.

2213
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
And God forbid, you know, Call of Duty.

2214
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,000
There's a lot of companies that are guilty of that,

2215
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
but the fact that Nintendo has the balls to go,

2216
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
hey, look, we're taking these GameCube games

2217
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
and we're putting them on the Wii.

2218
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,000
They're new because they're now on the Wii.

2219
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,000
We didn't really do anything to them other than change the controls.

2220
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:41,000
If that's the case, where the fuck is my F-Zero?

2221
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:45,000
That is the one GameCube game I have yet to see come over to the Wii.

2222
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,000
And might I point out, not only is it just a GameCube game,

2223
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,000
it was the best fucking GameCube game that ever came out.

2224
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Well, I'm sorry, they have to do Donkey Kong's Jungle Beat first

2225
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
because apparently people like that game.

2226
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,000
It didn't sell very well with the bongos, but hey, you know.

2227
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And you know what, we can also do a Donkey Kong racing game

2228
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
that used to be with the bongos,

2229
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
but no, now we're just going to add some sort of wacky controls.

2230
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Three words. Three words.

2231
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Fuck Donkey Kong.

2232
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Donkey Kong is best left to the memory of the Super Nintendo

2233
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
awesomely 3D rendered games Donkey Kong countries that were there.

2234
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I'm over it. Let's move on.

2235
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Where's my F-Zero game that I can play online?

2236
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Dude, where's my good updated Star Fox?

2237
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:36,000
And they always manage to take their sequels and fuck them over in some way.

2238
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Perfect example, Excite Truck, the best racing game on the Wii.

2239
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Sequel set to come out, Excite Bots Trick Racing.

2240
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,000
What the fuck did you do there?

2241
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Oh, people like Transformers.

2242
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
What the fuck does throwing a pie at a clown have anything to do with racing?

2243
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
It doesn't have anything to do with racing.

2244
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And God forbid they just shit on that sequel.

2245
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
But I was an idiot and bought it because, you know,

2246
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I had hope that it was going to be as good as the original,

2247
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
but no, it wasn't.

2248
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Fool me once.

2249
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
You will not fool me twice.

2250
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
I see some chat, and the chat's kind of flying right now.

2251
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
I can't really keep up with it, but I do see Game Guru

2252
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
saying something about the God of War collection.

2253
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
It's God of War 1 and 2 in HD.

2254
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Rar. I mean, does that fall into-

2255
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
At least it's in HD.

2256
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,000
If they improve the graphics on the Wii games on those new play control games,

2257
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
hey, that's different, okay?

2258
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Because that's, you know-

2259
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Well, would they have widescreen now?

2260
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Oh.

2261
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Well, I take it all back.

2262
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,000
But might I point out, F-Zero, again,

2263
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:45,000
which I worship that game's cock because it's amazing,

2264
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,000
F-Zero on the GameCube had widescreen support.

2265
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
It had, if I remember right, progressive scan support

2266
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
and all that fancy stuff on the GameCube.

2267
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Same with God of War 2.

2268
02:07:54,000 --> 02:08:01,000
That also had 720p support through a code.

2269
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Can we move on past the Nintendo hatred?

2270
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Yes, we can.

2271
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
And the thousands of subscribers.

2272
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
We just lost all the Nintendo fanboys,

2273
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
crying in the corner.

2274
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I still stand by, you know what, again,

2275
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,000
the thing that pisses me off about Nintendo

2276
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
is that it's not that I don't disagree with Loki.

2277
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Most of what he's saying I pretend to agree with,

2278
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
but then they release that one fucking game

2279
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
that's so fucking great, I have to have it,

2280
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
and it justifies the purchase of a Wii.

2281
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
And you have all this shit out there flooding the market

2282
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
in that one game on the goddamn Wii

2283
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
that you just aren't going to get anywhere else,

2284
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,000
like New Super Mario Brothers Wii.

2285
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Just like Mario Kart, Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64,

2286
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
the best fucking deathmatch battle mode ever

2287
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
was in those games.

2288
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
And then the GameCube and the Wii version,

2289
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,000
they just like, eh, let's just fucking ruin it.

2290
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
We don't know what plays that.

2291
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Who cares?

2292
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
We'll just fuck it over, because no one.

2293
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
You think that's how the boardroom meetings go?

2294
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Let's fuck this game up just for fun today.

2295
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
We're in a recession.

2296
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Let's have fun with it.

2297
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
All they had to do was leave it exactly the same

2298
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
and just make new levels.

2299
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
That's it.

2300
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
No improvement needed.

2301
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
It was perfect the way it was.

2302
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
But somehow they just go, eh, no!

2303
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Throwing it together!

2304
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
And they just ruined the whole thing

2305
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
because they wanted to improve upon it.

2306
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Way to go!

2307
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Have you ever heard the phrase, you know,

2308
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,000
if it ain't broke, don't fix it?

2309
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
All right, let's move on.

2310
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Yes, please.

2311
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
All right.

2312
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
How about July?

2313
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Hey, July.

2314
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Some publishers went kaput in July.

2315
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Eidos got retired, because obviously it folded

2316
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
into Square Enix,

2317
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,000
and so they don't really use the Eidos label anymore.

2318
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
And Midway closed.

2319
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Remember all this stuff that was going on with Midway

2320
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
and bankruptcy and LOL liquidation

2321
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
and all this stuff that was going on with Midway

2322
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
and all their assets?

2323
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
What happened to Midway?

2324
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Loki, what happened?

2325
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Maybe I should go to dark soccer for a little while.

2326
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I need a little less angst over here.

2327
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
What happened to Midway?

2328
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,000
It's just decision after decision, I think.

2329
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:19,000
It was inevitable, especially given how many...

2330
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
You want to go ahead and open the door?

2331
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I think that it was just given... what?

2332
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,000
No, I just would get some cool air in here.

2333
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
It's getting stuffy, that's all.

2334
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Rob, it's just me.

2335
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Well, Loki's ranting.

2336
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Just got the temperature up in here about 10 degrees,

2337
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
so I needed it to cool off a little bit.

2338
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Sorry, dark soccer.

2339
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I think that it was just...

2340
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
It was bound to happen.

2341
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
You know, they've been losing money.

2342
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,000
And, you know, especially given,

2343
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,000
weren't they still the ones who solely owned

2344
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
the Mortal Kombat franchise for a while?

2345
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Those games certainly weren't doing much of anything.

2346
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Yeah, sadly.

2347
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I mean, they had the DC Universe game, but it was...

2348
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,000
That was crap.

2349
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Yeah.

2350
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I think it was just inevitable.

2351
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Because apparently Blitz League did not pay the bills.

2352
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
And then their next genius idea,

2353
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
which thankfully never came out,

2354
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
This is Vegas.

2355
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Yes, the game that simulates going to Vegas.

2356
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Partying, driving cars, having sex with women, and gambling.

2357
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,000
What?

2358
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Let's see, some of the news that came out of August.

2359
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Apparently Wii Sports Resort was the best-selling game of August.

2360
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,000
There you go, Loki.

2361
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I thought I'd mention that just for you.

2362
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
And the PlayStation 3 Slim was unveiled.

2363
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,000
So let's get away from Nintendo for a minute here

2364
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
and talk about maybe the PlayStation 3,

2365
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
because I think this was probably the smartest thing Sony did all year.

2366
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
It was something they should have done a year ago,

2367
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,000
was drop the price down to $299.

2368
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Yes, they were retarded from the get-go,

2369
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,000
saying, oh yeah, our system's going to be $599.

2370
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
What?

2371
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Don't you remember that YouTube?

2372
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Because I know we played it on this show like a million times.

2373
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
It was the press conference in under a minute that would go,

2374
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:06,000
$599 US dollars, $599 US dollars.

2375
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
And just like over and over again.

2376
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Because that really was the moment.

2377
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Everybody was so jazzed about the PlayStation 3,

2378
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
and then they're like, it's going to be $599.

2379
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:19,000
And everybody's like, I remember us watching that on TV.

2380
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
We're like, are you fucking kidding me?

2381
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Or Africa.

2382
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Which finally came out this year, didn't it?

2383
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:30,000
And it sucked.

2384
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Well, I'm trying to find that real quick,

2385
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
since we are talking about the decade here.

2386
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Oh yes, here's one of the highlights of the decade,

2387
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,000
the 2006 Sony press conference.

2388
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I love this clip.

2389
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
It's one of my favorite YouTubes of the year.

2390
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
So let's just take a look back at how we got to the slim

2391
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
finally this year at $299.

2392
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai.

2393
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Ridge Racer.

2394
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change,

2395
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
and the consumers are ready.

2396
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Genji 2 is an Ashen game, which is based on Japanese history.

2397
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Ridge Racer.

2398
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Being based on history, the stages of the game

2399
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,000
can also be based on famous battles,

2400
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
which actually took place in ancient Japan.

2401
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
So here's this giant enemy crab.

2402
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Ridge Racer.

2403
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:25,000
And you attack its weak point for massive damage.

2404
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
It's Ridge Racer.

2405
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Ridge Racer.

2406
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:33,000
PlayStation 3 will retail for $599.

2407
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
$599.

2408
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
$599.

2409
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Giant enemy crab.

2410
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
$599.

2411
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
$599.

2412
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
$599 US dollars.

2413
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
It's Ridge Racer.

2414
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Ridge Racer.

2415
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
That is the best thing to come out of the decade,

2416
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
by the way, in gaming, was that little one-minute clip

2417
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
from YouTube user macaw45.

2418
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Congratulations.

2419
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Why didn't they do it sooner, Loki?

2420
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Why didn't Sony figure out,

2421
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
maybe we should have dropped the price a long time ago.

2422
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Were they just stubborn with the whole Blu-ray thing?

2423
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
If they would have dropped the price sooner,

2424
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
they would have sold more units,

2425
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
but they would have also lost their ass

2426
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
from the cost of the system.

2427
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
And the problem was just building a system

2428
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,000
with that much in components in the first place,

2429
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
it's tough to justify.

2430
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
So they ended up having to cut some corners and stuff,

2431
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
and once the prices of the components came down,

2432
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
they could actually justify dropping the price of the system.

2433
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
It was a little late, so they have some catching up to do,

2434
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
but we'll see.

2435
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
September, some other companies followed along

2436
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
with some price drops.

2437
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
The Wii dropped to $200.

2438
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
That happened in September.

2439
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
And some of the information came out about the PSP Go

2440
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:50,000
that there would be no conversion that happens.

2441
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Like if you own a UMD and you want to upgrade to the PSP Go,

2442
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:59,000
you can rebuy your game because of licensing issues.

2443
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Licensing issues.

2444
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
But wait, the PSP Go wasn't confirmed yet, was it?

2445
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I think by September it was.

2446
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
They showed it at E3, dummy.

2447
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
No, it wasn't at E3.

2448
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Yes it was, it was in that back room, wasn't it?

2449
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
You were wrong.

2450
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I could have sworn it was there.

2451
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
PSP Go was not at E3.

2452
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
PSP Go was shown at Gamescom.

2453
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Fine.

2454
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:26,000
So by September, Gamescom happened anyway.

2455
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Let's see, and then moving on into more recent things

2456
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:33,000
that happened to sum up 2009.

2457
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Well, when the PSP Go finally did launch in October,

2458
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
that added 100 PSP games to the PlayStation Network.

2459
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
And that was really some of the biggest stuff that came out.

2460
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Otherwise, some of the stuff about Modern Warfare 2

2461
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
was coming out pretty soon.

2462
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
And some news about the DSi XL,

2463
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
although that hasn't come out yet.

2464
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,000
The early news of that came out in October.

2465
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
DSi XL.

2466
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
What do you think?

2467
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
It's just, it's unnecessary.

2468
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I'm really at the point of all of this that I'm like,

2469
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
whatever, people are gonna buy it, whatever,

2470
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I'm not getting one.

2471
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Not yet anyway.

2472
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
It's unnecessary, it really is.

2473
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Let's keep shrinking down the system.

2474
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Oh wait, let's make it bigger.

2475
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Okay, put the Game Boy Advance slot back in it then,

2476
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
if you're gonna make it bigger.

2477
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Oh no, we can't do that.

2478
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Alright.

2479
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
What's the point of making the screens bigger?

2480
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
For old people.

2481
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Because bigger's better.

2482
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Yeah, it's for old people.

2483
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
But remember, remember with the Game Boy Advance,

2484
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
smaller was better, hence the micro.

2485
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
And then that didn't sell very well,

2486
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
so they must have said, oh, never mind, bigger's better.

2487
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Right?

2488
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
And it's a spectator system now, remember?

2489
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Because people want to watch you play DSi games.

2490
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Then I suggest you put a video out on the system.

2491
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
There's a thought.

2492
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Play it on your TV.

2493
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
And yes, I understand that wouldn't really make sense,

2494
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:05,000
you know, playing a DSi on a TV since it's dual screen,

2495
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:09,000
but hey, you could maybe split the video signal or something,

2496
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:14,000
or you could just put the top screen on there.

2497
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Bottom screen, whatever.

2498
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Just jamming through the last couple months here,

2499
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
because they did just happen.

2500
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
In November, of course, EA cut 1,500 jobs.

2501
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
That was 17% of their games.

2502
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Canceled a dozen games.

2503
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Not good year for EA in that department,

2504
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:30,000
because that was the second big layoff story we got out of EA in the year.

2505
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
And that was also the month where we had a funny story

2506
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
about how World of Warcraft was closed in China for three months,

2507
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
and we kind of joked about what would happen

2508
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
if you couldn't log into World of Warcraft for three months.

2509
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,000
There would be some people that just wouldn't know what to do with themselves.

2510
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
People would go outdoors.

2511
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I know it would be.

2512
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
And then they would take all my oxygen.

2513
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
What can we do about that?

2514
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And then one of my favorite rumors that came out in December

2515
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:55,000
that Logitech apparently is making a UMD add-on for the PSP Go.

2516
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I mean, how ridiculous is that idea?

2517
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
A, why would it be coming from Logitech,

2518
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
unless I guess they're doing it on behalf of Sony or whatever,

2519
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
but still, just what?

2520
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,000
It's dumb.

2521
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Isn't that the point?

2522
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
First off, why would you buy that?

2523
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I don't understand why you would even pay the money to buy a UMD add-on

2524
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,000
for a system that was more expensive than the PSP 3000 in the first place.

2525
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:23,000
And the PSP 3000 has everything that the Go has,

2526
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:26,000
with the exception of the Bluetooth, which is fine.

2527
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:31,000
But I also don't understand why you would do that.

2528
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
You'd have to be pretty dumb.

2529
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Just pull the PSP Go off shelves already and cut your losses

2530
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
and make a PSP 2 or something.

2531
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I don't know.

2532
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,000
All right.

2533
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
That does it for kind of our year, a little wrap-up there,

2534
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
kind of walking down memory lane and some of the stories there.

2535
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
We're going to get to the decade in a little bit.

2536
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
I'm going to kind of just open up the Skype line

2537
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
to kind of talk about the decade.

2538
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,000
We'll get to that in a minute,

2539
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
but of course we do have some segments we like to do here every week

2540
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
on Orange Lounge Radio.

2541
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
And one of them is very important.

2542
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
It's our moments of angst,

2543
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
because there were a lot of stupid people this year

2544
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
and stupid people that robbed things,

2545
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
like that guy who stole the Xbox and then played it

2546
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
so they were able to find who they were.

2547
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Just a lot of stupidity out there.

2548
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:16,000
He who shall not be named, the lawyer that was disbarred,

2549
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:21,000
one of my personal highlights of the year 2000 to 2010 and so forth.

2550
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Anyhow, we're going to call this our FUs of the Week.

2551
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,000
But in some regards, maybe this is the FUs of the Decade.

2552
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
I don't know.

2553
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Here they are, the FUs of the Week.

2554
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
I actually do have an FU of the Week,

2555
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:51,000
which just goes to the TSA for putting in stricter ticket rules, I guess,

2556
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:54,000
where your name has to fully match.

2557
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,000
And my credit card information, when I buy my ticket,

2558
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
it's going to come up under my name as I have it listed for my billing information,

2559
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
which is not exactly how my name shows on my license.

2560
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,000
So yeah, annoying.

2561
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
But that's about it.

2562
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,000
And then as far as the year or the decade, I should say,

2563
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:17,000
the biggest FU has actually already happened, Rob.

2564
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
What's got disbarred?

2565
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:25,000
If that's not a ginormous FU, I don't know what is.

2566
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
All right, fair enough.

2567
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Loki, what are your FUs of the Week and the Decade?

2568
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:32,000
I don't really know.

2569
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I guess FU2, I don't really have anything.

2570
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I guess FU2, myself, for not being able to play a lot of games during the holiday break,

2571
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:50,000
I think a lot of time I wasted trying to get games for my main cabinet,

2572
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
which I should just really play on the main cabinet,

2573
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:56,000
because I have, what, thousands of games on there already,

2574
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
and I haven't touched most of them.

2575
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
So why do I need more games?

2576
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I know, because I need more of everything.

2577
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,000
That's why.

2578
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And then the FU of the Decade goes to...

2579
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
God, I don't even know.

2580
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
That's tough to just nail down one thing.

2581
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I guess...

2582
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:22,000
To Nintendo for disappointing us on a consistent basis.

2583
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Hey, God damn it, embrace online!

2584
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,000
My FU of the Week, I don't know, I'm not super angsty.

2585
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:36,000
My FU of the Week goes to selfishness,

2586
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:40,000
because I think there's some selfish people out there I'm learning about,

2587
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
and I don't like it.

2588
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:48,000
My FU of the Decade goes to people that steal things that aren't theirs.

2589
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,000
You might remember this decade, my car was broken into a multitude of times.

2590
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:57,000
We had these people talking about stealing Xboxes and so forth

2591
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:01,000
that stupidly sign on to them online, stealing passwords

2592
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
and using them to hack people's accounts.

2593
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
FU to people that don't have the common decency to not touch shit that isn't theirs.

2594
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Oh, and FU to Proposition 8, that was pretty fucked up too.

2595
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Hey, back to the show.

2596
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
How about the segment of the show where we open up ye old mailbag

2597
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
and see what our listeners have to say?

2598
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:31,000
That would be at our mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com address.

2599
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
We have two emails.

2600
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Alrighty.

2601
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,000
First one, hey, OLR, I was in Spanish class a few days ago

2602
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
and thinking about the new year.

2603
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
We should have been focusing on Spanish.

2604
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Then I started thinking about really crappy games with peripherals

2605
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
that no one will buy like Band Hero and Tony Hawk Ride.

2606
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:51,000
So my question to you is what are your peripheral predictions for the new year?

2607
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Personally, mine will be a knife and fork and stuff like that

2608
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,000
for a new Cooking Mama game.

2609
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
They've already done that actually.

2610
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Well, you know, there's actually a burger flipping ticket game

2611
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
that came out in Japan.

2612
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I think that we're going to get Boonga Boonga for the home

2613
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
and it comes with a real finger to butt peripheral.

2614
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Whatever happened to the table flipping game that was out in Japan?

2615
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I'd like to see that out of here.

2616
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
It's out in Japan. That's about it.

2617
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
What about here?

2618
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:24,000
I wonder if Boonga Boonga is actually emulated in MAME yet.

2619
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Go get it. Go get it, Loki.

2620
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Because if it is, that would be one hell of a fun game to make a peripheral for.

2621
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Dot, dot, dot.

2622
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,000
As far as the rest of the email, what I think next year as far as peripherals go,

2623
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
you already know it's the motion sensing stuff.

2624
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Natal and the ice cream cones from Sony.

2625
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Those are going to be the huge things, game changers, that come out next year.

2626
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,000
They're also going to come out with the, I think,

2627
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,000
not just necessarily something that reads your motion,

2628
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:56,000
but also, you know, I would actually like to see something

2629
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:03,000
that doesn't necessarily view your motion as much as

2630
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,000
checks your coordination, you know what I mean?

2631
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Like it gives you something like a full motion sensing DDR

2632
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:15,000
where it gives you your commands and then you have to mimic exactly.

2633
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Or even, you know, or even charades online.

2634
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Could you imagine that?

2635
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
You know what I don't want to see?

2636
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
That would be fun. I like that charades online idea.

2637
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:28,000
But what I don't want to see is this whole brain scanning thing.

2638
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Have you heard about the brain devices?

2639
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Like the game that you control with your brain and all this stuff?

2640
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
I don't like that idea.

2641
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I don't like that at all.

2642
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I hope that isn't where peripherals go next year.

2643
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I just, I don't like the whole thought reading thing.

2644
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
It's kind of a little freaky to me.

2645
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Call me a warrior or whatever.

2646
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I just, you know, just a little weird.

2647
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Anything else in the mail, Ag?

2648
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Yes. Well, there's still more to that one.

2649
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Oh, my bad.

2650
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Yeah, Rob, duh.

2651
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Sorry, I have to give you a hard time.

2652
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
As soon as I can find where the crap my thing went to.

2653
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
There we go.

2654
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Also, I wondered where you guys get your news from.

2655
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Do you have a set or are you all over the place?

2656
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:12,000
My favorite right now is games with a Z traffic dot com.

2657
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Look it up. Thanks, Mike.

2658
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
I think you just gave somebody a free plug.

2659
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Why not? I don't mind.

2660
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Alright.

2661
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
You know, I go Eurogamer for a lot of my stuff.

2662
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
I use Google Reader and I feed several different websites into Google Reader.

2663
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
You know why Google Reader is awesome?

2664
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Because, like, anybody that tries to firewall access to certain sites at certain places,

2665
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Google Reader gets around that.

2666
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Yes.

2667
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Also, another one.

2668
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Hi, everyone.

2669
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
This is from Spazinator, by the way.

2670
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Hi, everyone. Seeing as this is topics and questions may possibly run a little long,

2671
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:48,000
I opted to send them via email rather than Twitter.

2672
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Seeing as it's the end of the year and traditionally everyone seemingly does a top ten list of some sort,

2673
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,000
why not have the O.L. Army do one?

2674
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
But do one with a twist.

2675
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:03,000
What I had in mind was a list of top games that came out this year that you love to have

2676
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:08,000
the Hillary Clintons and the Voldemorts of the world be forced to play nonstop for days on end

2677
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,000
just to drive them all crazy.

2678
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Well, even crazier than they already happen to be.

2679
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Also, seeing as the year is virtually over, I have two questions.

2680
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Compared to 2008, how do you feel about 2009 fared in regards to game releases,

2681
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:22,000
sales of both consoles and games, as well as improvements to consoles,

2682
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,000
and or their online services, both in terms of actual hardware revisions,

2683
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:30,000
or as well as firmware updates.

2684
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:34,000
I have no opinion. It's about the same.

2685
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:38,000
I've got to say, I think 09 has been a lot more disappointing than 08.

2686
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I think we've had a lot of disappointments this year.

2687
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Games getting pushed back, quality of games, you know, don't seem to be up there.

2688
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,000
I mean, there's lots of exceptions to this rule, don't get me wrong.

2689
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Of course, there's been some real gems that have been released this year,

2690
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
but I think layoffs, et cetera, it's been a lot of disappointment this year.

2691
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I don't think there's a lot of good that came out of this year.

2692
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Except for, yeah, I got nothing.

2693
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:06,000
President Cat is the good thing that came out this year, that's it.

2694
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Two, and as far as 2010 is concerned,

2695
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:12,000
is there anything in particular that's been announced that you three are eagerly awaiting?

2696
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Do you have any possible predictions for 2010?

2697
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Or at least something you hope to see happen?

2698
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:22,000
I hope that we get President Cat.

2699
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:27,000
To kind of piggyback on what Loki was ranting about earlier,

2700
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
I would really like to see Nintendo come out at E3

2701
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:32,000
and do the system they should have done last time.

2702
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I understand that Wii was their gamble, yay for them, they won.

2703
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
I would like to see them kind of take that up to the next level

2704
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
and catch up finally to where their competitors are at

2705
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
as far as the hardcore gamers are concerned,

2706
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:48,000
with the HD and the online and all that fun stuff.

2707
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:54,000
It's not going to happen, but you asked what I want to see.

2708
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,000
And I'm always a big fan of more retro goodness,

2709
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:00,000
so I would like to see more retro games coming back,

2710
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,000
this whole achievements and trophies and cooperative online play.

2711
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I'm a big fan of all that stuff.

2712
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:11,000
I wish the Virtual Console had achievements within it,

2713
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:15,000
or ways that I could experience all these old games again with friends.

2714
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:20,000
As neat as Virtual Console is for some of the great retro games,

2715
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
it feels very lazy to me.

2716
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:26,000
It's just an emulator you're paying for.

2717
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:30,000
And to be fair, Xbox 360 has a lot of these games in their arcade, too.

2718
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
I'm not just picking on Nintendo here.

2719
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
A lot of arcade releases on 360,

2720
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
and Microsoft finally put their foot down on this,

2721
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:40,000
was just retro stuff that would throw in some achievements.

2722
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I don't know, I just would like to see retro games.

2723
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
It has been a decent year for retro gaming.

2724
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:46,000
I think it has been a decent year, though, for retro gaming already.

2725
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Because we've gotten certainly a lot of nods,

2726
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I mean, Bionic Commando, and...

2727
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:55,000
You know, I really, though, want to see something really innovative.

2728
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
I want to see something really original.

2729
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I want to see a game.

2730
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I want to see working designs come back,

2731
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
and bring out all the cool stuff from Japan.

2732
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
That's what I want.

2733
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I'm holding my breath.

2734
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Is that it for that email?

2735
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Or is there more?

2736
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I think that's it.

2737
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
All right.

2738
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Yeah, that's it.

2739
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchrater.com is the place to send your emails.

2740
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Now we'll get into the decade a little bit,

2741
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:26,000
and I don't want to linger too long on this,

2742
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:29,000
but it's interesting that we're getting to the close of another decade here,

2743
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,000
the O's or whatever we're going to end up calling these in the past.

2744
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
If you think about it, it started.

2745
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Let me just rewind ten years ago here,

2746
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:44,000
and I realize the majority of our listeners are somewhere between 18 and 25,

2747
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:48,000
meaning when this decade started, you were between 8 and 15.

2748
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:52,000
So, I mean, games have kind of evolved with many of you,

2749
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
and of course, not all of our listeners.

2750
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Heck, the hosts don't fit into that age bracket.

2751
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:00,000
I'm considerably older than that, as we all are,

2752
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,000
but I realize that that's where a lot of the listener base is,

2753
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
and just how much games have changed.

2754
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Just to kind of rewind ten years and show you how far we've come.

2755
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Here are some of the big things that happened in the year 2000.

2756
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:18,000
PlayStation 2 was launched in the year 2000.

2757
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:21,000
That's when the PlayStation 2 came out.

2758
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Let's see.

2759
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Nintendo finally sold its 100th millionth Game Boy handheld console.

2760
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Sega launched Sega Net into the year 2000,

2761
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:38,000
and that's when the Dreamcast Championships took off.

2762
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Some of the games that came out in the year 2000.

2763
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,000
The Sims came out January 31st of the year 2000.

2764
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I think it was almost ten years old.

2765
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Thief 2 came out in the year 2000.

2766
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Vagrant Story.

2767
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,000
EverQuest came out in the year 2000.

2768
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Deus Ex.

2769
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Diablo 2 was from the year 2000.

2770
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
That game feels even older.

2771
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Final Fantasy IX had a release in Japan in the year 2000.

2772
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Chrono Cross came out in 2000.

2773
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Dragon Quest VII.

2774
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:14,000
American McGee's Alice.

2775
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,000
The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask was in the year 2000.

2776
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,000
What else we also had that year?

2777
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Seaman.

2778
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Was that really?

2779
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Seaman, do they have a lot of Dreamcast stuff on there?

2780
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Yeah, they account for Dreamcast on this list.

2781
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:37,000
I think Seaman might have either been 2000 or 2001.

2782
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:40,000
But yeah, the Dreamcast stuff was all early.

2783
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Escape from Monkey Island.

2784
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Tekken Tag Tournament.

2785
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Final Fantasy IX got its release over here too.

2786
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Skies of Arcadia.

2787
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Banjo-Tooie.

2788
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Here's some Dreamcast.

2789
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Grandia 2 came out towards the end of the year 2000.

2790
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Grandia 2, I played a lot of that.

2791
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:01,000
I played through half of it in Japanese and then I was actually...

2792
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:06,000
That's one of the games that I found out that my Japanese save file worked on the US one.

2793
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
You know what else game did that?

2794
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Power Stone.

2795
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Wow.

2796
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,000
So, think about it.

2797
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,000
I mean, just to kind of go all the way back.

2798
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Ten years ago we were a completely different generation of video games.

2799
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Because the launch of the new generation, if you will, of games didn't really happen until...

2800
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
What about 2005, 2006?

2801
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I think E3 is when we started hearing about this new round of consoles.

2802
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
And then you go back.

2803
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:35,000
I mean, heck, the GameCube just came out in, what, like 01?

2804
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Now we have the Wii.

2805
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:40,000
I mean, we've gone through many, many different game systems in this generation.

2806
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:44,000
So we would have had that all touched this last ten years.

2807
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:51,000
We had the Dreamcast, the PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3, the GameCube, the Wii, the Xbox.

2808
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Microsoft got into gaming in these past few years, or not even ten years ago.

2809
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
And the Xbox 360.

2810
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:00,000
And then, of course, I'm not even counting handhelds and the countless amounts of those.

2811
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:04,000
And, you know, other one-off systems that came out as well.

2812
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:07,000
So it's going to be interesting, you know, in the next ten years, in the next generation,

2813
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:11,000
just how far games go will probably be another generation.

2814
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:14,000
We'll be talking about the PlayStation 4 and other Xboxes.

2815
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:18,000
And maybe other companies that decide to get into gaming.

2816
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Or maybe one of these companies will buy another.

2817
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Who knows?

2818
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
It's going to be very interesting to see what happens.

2819
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Before we open up the phone calls, and yes, some folks in chat want to point out,

2820
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
OLR started in 2002.

2821
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:35,000
So while we didn't exist ten years ago, we're getting into our eighth year of broadcasting.

2822
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,000
That's quite some time.

2823
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
It's pretty impressive.

2824
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
What do you guys think?

2825
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
And I know this is a very difficult question.

2826
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
This is a very difficult question.

2827
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:49,000
But what do you guys think were some of the best games to come out of the decade?

2828
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:52,000
The best games to come out of all freaking decade.

2829
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Knowing that you have all of those systems available to you.

2830
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Not just maybe what was important to you, but what you think was important to gaming in general.

2831
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
The decade.

2832
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Loki, do you want to start? Do you have anything?

2833
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,000
DDR Max 2 in the arcade.

2834
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Why is that?

2835
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
It was fun.

2836
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:18,000
It got people back in the arcade because you had stuff that you were working to unlock.

2837
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:19,000
I don't know.

2838
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:22,000
I like 5th Mix too. That came out around the same.

2839
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,000
These were also games that brought us together.

2840
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,000
We wouldn't have OLR.

2841
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:31,000
As much shit as we give Konami and their music division now, ten years ago was a different story.

2842
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
We praised them. We loved them.

2843
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:36,000
But they made a lot of mistakes, sadly.

2844
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
That it? Anything on consoles you want to mention?

2845
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Oh yeah, of course.

2846
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Like Grand Theft Auto, I want to say 3 I think was around that time.

2847
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:46,000
I know definitely San Andreas was around that time.

2848
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
And those are pretty significant.

2849
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Other things I played that were really fun, let me think.

2850
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
I like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but I can't remember when that came out.

2851
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I think that was around that time.

2852
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Gosh, I don't know. There's a lot of stuff I played.

2853
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:16,000
It's hard to think back ten years. Everything I think about is more recent.

2854
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Final Fantasy X was pretty good.

2855
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Yeah, that was important.

2856
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
That was pretty important.

2857
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
11 for you. You spent a lot of time on that one.

2858
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
I spent a lot of time on 11. That was fun.

2859
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
First MMO?

2860
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Well, I played a little of my jerks online, but that sucked.

2861
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Gosh, yeah, it's tough.

2862
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Dark Sakura, anything you want to throw out there as far as your games of the decade?

2863
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Portal? Definitely Portal.

2864
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Seaman.

2865
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
DDR?

2866
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Well, keep in mind, I got DDR for home in 2000 on Dreamcast.

2867
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Rod Caliber Rob.

2868
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Rod Caliber is important.

2869
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
You remember Rod Caliber, don't you?

2870
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Yes, that's when you play Soul Caliber with the rod.

2871
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Yeah, exactly. Rod Caliber.

2872
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Also, I'd have to say, probably as far as shooters go, I'd say Ikaruga, getting Gradius 5.

2873
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:25,000
There was a lot of good games that came out, though, in the decade.

2874
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:28,000
So, I'd really say...

2875
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Well, if I say Portal, I should say Nurbacular Drop, because that's really the game that gave us Portal.

2876
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:41,000
A lot of people thinking in interesting directions, especially with having the Dreamcast come out, the Naomi system, Hikaru after that.

2877
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Although, I still want Planet Harrier. Where is it?

2878
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:49,000
It doesn't work. I tried it during the beginning of the show.

2879
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Damn!

2880
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Sorry, it still doesn't work in MAME.

2881
02:36:53,000 --> 02:37:00,000
As far as my answer to the question, I've answered this on another show, but to kind of repeat it here on Orange Launch Radio, I think I would split it up into a few categories.

2882
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Me and Skype?

2883
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
No, you left yourself on.

2884
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Sorry.

2885
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Jamie's trying to have a sidebar conversation with me while I'm trying to talk on the internet.

2886
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Anyhow, what was I going to say? Oh yes, the game of the decade. Some things that came up.

2887
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:21,000
My personal favorite game of the decade, I think, was probably Animal Crossing, was one I really remember.

2888
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:24,000
I loved how you...

2889
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:32,000
As much slack as that game got for running around doing nothing, if you really went far with it, where you could go into somebody else's village...

2890
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:36,000
You brought your friend over with a memory card, and I remember we used to do this shit all the time.

2891
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Somebody would come over and we'd visit the town and try to get their townspeople to say dirty words and all this stuff.

2892
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:47,000
It was just a lot of fun. And also the fact that it had all the retro Nintendo games in it before Nintendo started gouging the prices for all this stuff.

2893
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:55,000
I just loved that game when it first came out, and it kind of sucks that the game's franchise has been milked through the DS and the Wii versions.

2894
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
It's just not really as fun anymore as it used to be.

2895
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:06,000
But that very first Animal Crossing that was on the GameCube in America, yes, I realize it's based off a Nintendo 64 game, but I'm not counting that because I didn't have an impact on our culture here in the US.

2896
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:12,000
That first Animal Crossing on the GameCube, I think, was probably one of the best gaming experiences I had all decade.

2897
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:23,000
As far as on a technical level, I know Loki's gonna kind of hate me for this, but I think Wii Sports, you have to recognize, is one of the best games of the decade because it got people to play games who don't play games.

2898
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:27,000
You see Wii Sports in nursing homes, for Christ's sake.

2899
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
But we didn't want those people playing games!

2900
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:35,000
You still have to recognize, though, that's still money in the gaming industry that can someday make a game you might want to play.

2901
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:41,000
No, it won't, because they'll be catering to these people that don't really care about games, but they like Wii Sports.

2902
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Okay, okay, hold on. But without Wii Sports, and basically the Wii in general, would we have Project Natal and the Sony ice cream cones, which may bring us the games you want to play, Loki?

2903
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I'm still skeptical on what they're gonna bring out.

2904
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:00,000
I'm skeptical too, but there is a possibility it could be pretty fucking awesome.

2905
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
And we would have Wii Sports to thank for that, like it or not.

2906
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Let's see, also I would say probably a good combination of both of those, both just personal favorite and I think it did a lot for gaming.

2907
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:20,000
World of Warcraft. Haters gonna hate. I know there's a lot of people that are anti-MMOs out there, but I think World of Warcraft did amazing stuff for online games.

2908
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:28,000
I think just for all, I think the way Blizzard kind of caters to the different audiences, Blizzard is like the best PC game maker.

2909
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:36,000
They are. They don't make, name a bad Blizzard game.

2910
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:49,000
I don't think there is one. Like maybe if you want to go back to like the Lost Vikings or shit that was out like years and years ago, but Blizzard, and to be fair, Blizzard doesn't make a lot of games, but World of Warcraft was great.

2911
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:56,000
And they continue to make it better and the expansions have been good and I mean 11 million people play this game and sometimes people you wouldn't expect.

2912
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:01,000
It's kind of created this whole new culture. It's been parodied on South Park and so forth.

2913
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Which was a very funny episode.

2914
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Yes, it was a very funny episode. I saw this list on Yahoo and I actually thought it was not a bad compilation.

2915
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:17,000
A lot of times I roll my eyes at these sites when they want to do a top 10 games of the decade, but I actually think Yahoo did a decent job.

2916
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:24,000
I wanted to share this with you guys. Again, this is coming from videogames.yahoo.com. This was their picks for the top 10 of the decade.

2917
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Number 10 from the year 2007, Super Mario Galaxy. I know Loki is a big fan of that, so Super Mario Galaxy from 2007.

2918
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,000
That's alright. I'm just saying Super Mario Galaxy 2 is not going to be that great.

2919
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Number 9, Half Life 2.

2920
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Definitely.

2921
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:48,000
I think sometimes I've forgotten about game from all of us console hoarding folks, but the orange box did bring this back to the forefront.

2922
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Half Life 2 is a hugely important PC game.

2923
02:40:51,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Just for the way it integrated story into the shooter game and the graphical level and just the fact that the game, you didn't really go from level to level.

2924
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
You were immersed in the game.

2925
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:07,000
I think it did a lot for gaming in that regard. That's a pretty good pick.

2926
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Some folks will probably put that a lot higher on their list. I don't know, but they put it in number 9.

2927
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Again, this list is coming from Yahoo video games and they write little blurbs with each of these I'm not going to read.

2928
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Wii Fit they put on their list in the year 2007.

2929
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,000
This is the only one I take a little bit of issue with. I get why it's here.

2930
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:29,000
They're putting this here for the same reason I named Wii Sports earlier because it opened up gaming to people that wouldn't usually play games.

2931
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:36,000
But is it a game or is it something that uses a game console to accomplish what it really wants to do? I don't know.

2932
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:43,000
I like this entry. I think this is often overlooked. Number 7, Bejeweled from the year 2001. The original Bejeweled.

2933
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,000
I can see that.

2934
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I can totally see that too and I think a lot of folks forget what PopCap and casual gaming has done for gaming in this decade.

2935
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
I think that's a very important game to note.

2936
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Number 6, they put Wii Sports. I don't think I need to say anything else with that.

2937
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Number 5, they put Halo.

2938
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:04,000
I don't think the Xbox would have survived if it wasn't for Halo.

2939
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:08,000
I think we'd be looking at the Xbox kind of like we look at the Atari Jaguar, honestly.

2940
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:16,000
I think Xbox kind of pushed, and especially Halo 2, kind of pushed the Xbox to what ended up happening on the 360.

2941
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:21,000
I think Halo was huge.

2942
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:25,000
And certainly Yahoo and their video game related site does too.

2943
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:30,000
You know Rob, it's all about Pest Society and Farmville.

2944
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:34,000
And number 4 was Guitar Hero they put on the list.

2945
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:41,000
And it's very interesting having done this as a music game based show when it was a very niche thing.

2946
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:48,000
It's very interesting that we have kind of watched music games explode into the mainstream and a lot of this is because of Guitar Hero.

2947
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:53,000
And they finally did what Konami should have thought to do a long fucking time ago.

2948
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Or excuse me, what Konami of Japan should have taken a risk on a long time ago and stopped being so bullheaded when it comes to releasing stuff in the US.

2949
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:03,000
And that is put in the songs that people in the US want to play.

2950
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:11,000
And granted, I know those of us here in studio and a lot of our long time listeners were fans of stuff that Konami was putting in those music games a long time ago.

2951
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:15,000
But we were a niche audience and those games were never going to break through.

2952
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Guitar Hero finally broke it through and I think that's important to note.

2953
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:21,000
And it debuted in our living room, in my living room.

2954
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:24,000
That's right, you guys had like a sneak peek.

2955
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:28,000
I wasn't here that day but you and Loki were on the news doing some sneak peek thing with Guitar Hero.

2956
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:29,000
I remember that, that was cool.

2957
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,000
That was pretty fun.

2958
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Just because I happen to have a big TV that wouldn't, you know, had a better refresh rate.

2959
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:42,000
I just want to point out a lot of our chatters because I'm kind of keeping one eye on chat.orangelandrado.com.

2960
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,000
So some interesting comments.

2961
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:47,000
GameGuru, Half Life 2 also introduced Steam onto the world.

2962
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
That was the first one that had Steam in it.

2963
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:53,000
And then quite a few folks yelling out PEGAL better than Bejeweled.

2964
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I love PEGAL.

2965
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,000
I do love PEGAL too.

2966
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Especially on iPhone.

2967
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
But I think without Bejeweled you wouldn't have PEGAL.

2968
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
So I can see why they opted to put PEGAL on the list.

2969
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Well I mean, shoot, without Tetris or Puzzle Bobble we wouldn't have, without Plinko we wouldn't have PEGAL.

2970
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:13,000
The number three game on Yahoo's list, The Sims, was the most important game of the decade.

2971
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:16,000
And you know what, I think The Sims was pretty fucking awesome.

2972
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:19,000
It was the best PC selling game for a long time.

2973
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:22,000
It might still be with all those expansions, I'm not sure.

2974
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:28,000
But the number two game is another PC game, World of Warcraft, they put on their list for pretty much the same reasons I did.

2975
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:31,000
So number one game, any guesses?

2976
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Big trendy things that haven't been named yet for the game of the decade?

2977
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Modern Warfare 2.

2978
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
It's game of the decade?

2979
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Yep, they're going to do that.

2980
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Okay.

2981
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Uh, I got nothing.

2982
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Grand Theft Auto 3 they named as the number one game of the decade, Grand Theft Auto 3.

2983
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:50,000
As it rightly should be.

2984
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,000
From 2001.

2985
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
I thought they would punk out and go.

2986
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:59,000
No, I mean, Grand Theft Auto 3 was really the first sandbox-y type of game like that, right?

2987
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:04,000
And just opened up this whole new type of video game, practically.

2988
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I have to admit, usually I look at those lists and roll my eyes, but maybe with the exception of Wii Fit, that was a pretty good list, I gotta say.

2989
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Let's see what you guys think about there.

2990
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Some of our folks in chat disagree.

2991
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:23,000
I don't know though, I realize Grand Theft Auto 3 might not be the type of game you play, but think about that whole sandbox type of game.

2992
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:28,000
I mean, Grand Theft Auto was really kind of the pioneer in that, and I think without Grand Theft Auto 3 you wouldn't have that.

2993
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and open up our Skype line and see what you guys have to say about the year in gaming and the decade in gaming.

2994
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
And honestly, it's just an open forum tonight.

2995
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Whatever you guys want to talk about, it's our last show of the decade, so please give us a call.

2996
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:54,000
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or you can always reach us on Skype at username ORANGELOUNGERADIO is the place to call.

2997
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls to come in, do we have any last minute stories, Loki?

2998
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:02,000
I haven't been looking at last minute stories.

2999
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Yeah, I'm sure we do have some.

3000
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Oh good, you're saved because we have a call coming in right now, so let's go ahead and take this call.

3001
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3002
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Hi, this is HackDeft.

3003
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Hi HackDeft, how you doing?

3004
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Pretty good.

3005
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Well, we're talking about, of course, the year in games, the decade in games, or really whatever you want to talk about tonight. What's on your mind?

3006
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Well, first of all, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, a late Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.

3007
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Same to you?

3008
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Thanks.

3009
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:34,000
And I want to talk about my game of the year.

3010
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Which is?

3011
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Possibly.

3012
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Forza Motorsport 3.

3013
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Ah, okay. That hasn't been mentioned yet on the show, but I can see that as somebody's choice.

3014
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:47,000
What is it about this game that makes it the game of the year for you?

3015
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:55,000
I can explain it in only one phrase. It's racing simulation for dummies.

3016
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:02,000
And why does that make it game of the year? I mean, Mario Kart Wii is kind of racing simulation for dummies, right?

3017
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Well, Mario Kart Wii is more like an arcade style of racing, while Forza is more of a simulation like Gran Turismo, where if you make a bad turn, you will crash.

3018
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:23,000
If you go too fast, you'll crash, and if you do everything wrong, you'll crash.

3019
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:43,000
And not like in Gran Turismo or any other racing game, your car has damages, and possibly, well, not possibly, and it will affect your racing.

3020
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Is it just the realism in that regard that makes this the game of the year for you, or is it like a graphical achievement, or what is it that just makes this game so awesome?

3021
02:47:52,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Everything. It has the graphics, it has the gameplay, it has the online, it has everything you can ask in a game, it has it in racing form.

3022
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:11,000
Like, the online community, I haven't played that much online, but it's good, and it has a lot of options.

3023
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:23,000
You can customize your car in tuning, you can paint it, you can make stickers or decals, and make your own car.

3024
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:28,000
It's like the teddy bear workshop, but in car form.

3025
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:49,000
And like I said, it's a pretty easy game to pick up, because the options let you begin to play, you have a lot of things that help you to race along and complete the challenges and all the tournaments and races you have to compete in.

3026
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:59,000
But if you're truly a racing expert, it also has all that other stuff that makes you like the game.

3027
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:02,000
It makes a real simulation.

3028
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Alright, well the only criteria that you really have to use is the type of game that you enjoy, it's just your criteria and no one else's.

3029
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:12,000
So if that's your game of the year, then so be it.

3030
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Well, we appreciate the call and you chiming in on your game of the year.

3031
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Are there any other quick thoughts you have for us tonight?

3032
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Well, other than that, I think that also Street Fighter IV is also a candidate for game of the year.

3033
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:28,000
A game that will offer you as a studio name.

3034
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:33,000
How do you say it? The rebirth of fighting games.

3035
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:37,000
It definitely did energize fighting games in kind of a new way this year.

3036
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:43,000
And it's interesting, having played Tekken 6 this week, I feel like Street Fighter IV did inspire some things in it.

3037
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:44,000
We'll see.

3038
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Yeah.

3039
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Alright, well thank you so much ActDeaf for the call. You have a great new year and be safe, okay?

3040
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:50,000
Thanks, you too.

3041
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Alright, later.

3042
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3043
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
We are open and taking some calls.

3044
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,000
And I know the call, the phones have been ringing.

3045
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:09,000
So we're going to wait here and try to get a call when it comes through.

3046
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Of course, now that I say that, nobody's calling in. It's like everybody's waiting because they still hear ActDeaf on the line.

3047
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Oh, we got another call coming in.

3048
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

3049
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:19,000
This is that one across the ocean, AkiRipper.

3050
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Hello AkiRipper.

3051
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Hello.

3052
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:24,000
So good to hear from you. How are things in your neck of the woods?

3053
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:32,000
It's fun. It's quite fun. We have like, mostly fun, there's like, what is it?

3054
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:36,000
We have like a few feet of snow.

3055
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:47,000
And we have like, well, what is it? Like 20 minus degrees Celsius for a night like around minus something to something degrees.

3056
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:51,000
And, well, yay.

3057
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Well, we're talking about, of course, by the way, it's been snowing here a little bit too and that was really creepy when that happened because it usually doesn't snow here.

3058
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:06,000
But it was kind of funny. You'd be very amused at how people freaked out over here at a little bit of snow when it wasn't even really snow.

3059
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
It was just like an eighth of an inch.

3060
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
It was like hail that stayed.

3061
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:15,000
I know, really. Anyhow, well, we're talking about, of course, video games and our games of the year and the decade.

3062
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Anything you want to bring to this conversation?

3063
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Game of the year is Sims 3, judging by the amount that I've played it.

3064
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:32,000
What makes Sims 3 your game of the year? I'm sure DarkSakura wouldn't argue with that, but what was it for you that made that game for you?

3065
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Well, I'm new to this whole Sims game, so to say, since Sims 3 was the first Sims game that I really got addicted to.

3066
02:51:45,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Add to the following fact that I haven't played WoW in almost a year now, so, well, there is that.

3067
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:09,000
And then there is the following fact that my computers tend to explode every new MMO release.

3068
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:15,000
It happened with Warhammer last year, and it happened with Aion.

3069
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:25,000
And, well, once I get to fix my computers, I have no desire to play any of those MMOs, unfortunately.

3070
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:31,000
What do you think it is? You know, we heard a lot this year about Aion possibly being the first game that's finally going to really challenge WoW,

3071
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:36,000
and then all of a sudden it kind of landed with this big, you know, like it just landed with a thud.

3072
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:41,000
You know, why is it that no MMO can take on WoW, you think?

3073
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:57,000
In my case, I don't know, since, well, as I said, my computers tend to just die a few weeks after it's been released, or the first week it is released.

3074
02:52:57,000 --> 02:53:10,000
And, well, there seems to be this unlucky... I have this sudden streak of unlocked, and it's quite annoying.

3075
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Other mentions, well, Shadow Complex and Dragon Age Origins.

3076
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Even though Dragon Age Origins has been said before, because of the only games I play is mostly like The Sims 3,

3077
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:43,000
so I can't play, haven't played, since Dragon Age Origins that much.

3078
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:47,000
You know, I gotta say, I'm having similar problems, I think, to you in regards to my computer just kind of goes,

3079
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:52,000
eh, can't do it when trying to play Dragon Age. I probably should have picked it up on the console, but I don't know why,

3080
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Dragon Age just feels like a game I need to play on the PC, so, you know, and that's where the good deal was.

3081
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:01,000
So, but yeah, that's a game that wasn't really mentioned before, it's a possible Game of the Year contender,

3082
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:06,000
and I think definitely a lot of big, big fans of that game, so.

3083
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:20,000
Other than that, well, this year I actually got a 360, so, well, yay on me. Supposedly so.

3084
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:25,000
A lot of people joined in the Xbox 360 Club and the PS3 Club this year, too, with the Slim.

3085
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Anyway, Acre Reaper, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call,

3086
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
and getting in tonight, alright?

3087
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Yeah, well, better.

3088
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Have a good New Year!

3089
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:37,000
He gets to see it before we do, because of his time zone, just so you know.

3090
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:40,000
So, he'll have to let us know how it is.

3091
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Alright, we got another call coming in. Phones, we're getting off the hook tonight.

3092
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Let's go to another call.

3093
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3094
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Hello, it's Maren.

3095
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
Hi, Maren, how are you?

3096
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:54,000
I'm very good, thank you. How's everybody in the Orange Lounge Radio studio?

3097
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,000
We are doing good. You should know you were here last week.

3098
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Yes, I was. I apparently came the wrong weekend.

3099
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Geez.

3100
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Why's that?

3101
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:10,000
So, anyways, I just wanted to talk about Game of the Year slash Game of the Decade caps.

3102
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Please, please, yes. What would be your Game of the Year?

3103
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:17,000
At first, I just wanted to say I'm glad to hear you got home safe, because I know you drove all the way,

3104
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:18,000
and that's not a fun drive.

3105
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,000
No.

3106
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
But what was your Game of the Year and the Game of the Decade?

3107
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:25,000
My Game of the Year definitely was Beatles' rock band.

3108
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:33,000
As DarkSakura knows, because she was at my house visiting in the summer, I am a very, very, very big Beatles fan,

3109
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:39,000
so it was nice to get a rock band game that had a lot of songs that I know,

3110
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:42,000
as opposed to most of them, where I don't know a lot of the songs,

3111
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:45,000
because I'm an old fart and I only listen to oldies music.

3112
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:51,000
There's a lot of people just like you, though, that do that. They don't understand kids today.

3113
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:55,000
No, those kids and their strange music.

3114
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:02,000
So, yeah, it was nice to have a rock band game where I could actually sing all of the songs and enjoy myself.

3115
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:06,000
It wasn't as hardcore, I don't think, as the other rock band games,

3116
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:10,000
but it was fun for me and it was something I really enjoyed.

3117
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:14,000
It was put together beautifully, too, I think is one of the great things about it,

3118
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
is just visually it's a cool game.

3119
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Dude, that bass was awesome.

3120
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Yeah, it's really great and I still like every time that I play through the game and I play the end,

3121
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:28,000
there's like one part where Paul starts to sing end in the end and I'm like,

3122
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,000
I love you, Paul, it's so great.

3123
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:37,000
It's like you're back in the 1960s screaming at the Ed Sullivan Theater at the Beatles on the stage. Amazing.

3124
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:44,000
And actually what was funny was that I went to, when I was visiting, we played Beatles Rock Band

3125
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:53,000
and Dark Soccer has got the whole woofer sub surround sound, weird, all that crazy stuff.

3126
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:58,000
And when you were playing the songs that were live in Shea Stadium,

3127
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:03,000
one of the speakers that was behind us was all the girls screaming.

3128
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:09,000
And so it was just kind of funny to be playing and hearing girls screaming like crazy behind you.

3129
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
That's funny.

3130
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:14,000
What about Game of the Decade? Is this also your Game of the Decade or do you have a different pick?

3131
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Game of the Decade was kind of more difficult.

3132
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:24,000
I decided to go with something that came out actually at the beginning of the decade and that was Diablo II.

3133
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:27,000
We mentioned that in our 2000 list, yeah?

3134
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Yeah, and I think Diablo II definitely paved the way for a lot of the kind of games that we enjoy now,

3135
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:39,000
like World of Warcraft, Warcraft III, things like that.

3136
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:45,000
And it was just overall a really good game and I still play that.

3137
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Yeah, there's still a lot of people playing that.

3138
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:50,000
There's still no Diablo III. There's still a lot of people playing Diablo II.

3139
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:56,000
But it's funny you kind of say that Diablo II paved the way for games like WoW because I really do agree.

3140
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:01,000
In fact, I used to kind of joke in World of Warcraft that it really should have just been called World of Diablo

3141
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
because that's kind of how it plays.

3142
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Yeah, it really does.

3143
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
It plays a little more like Diablo and it is Warcraft.

3144
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:13,000
But yeah, there's so many great games that came out of this decade,

3145
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:18,000
but I think Diablo II really paved the way for a lot of other games and it was just overall really a good game.

3146
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:25,000
Like I said, I still play it, so if it's a game that you can play 10 years later, then that's something worthwhile.

3147
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:29,000
I think that's a darn good pick, so I'm not going to argue with you there.

3148
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Maybe even though I picked something different, I can certainly see where Diablo II, without that we would not have had WoW.

3149
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
So it's a very good pick.

3150
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:40,000
And Battle.net and this whole infrastructure they had to build for that too.

3151
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:43,000
That's something that's continuing to evolve for them.

3152
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:47,000
Well, anything else on your mind tonight before we get to some more calls?

3153
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:52,000
No, that's it. I know you guys are ringing off the hook because I've tried calling in a few times before I got through.

3154
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:56,000
So I'll go ahead and let you go and it was nice chatting with you guys again.

3155
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
Thank you. It was very good to chat with you too.

3156
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:01,000
I think that we should take this opportunity though for a plug.

3157
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:04,000
I was actually going to say, yeah, before I let her go, I know you guys.

3158
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Because this is how I know something's up.

3159
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:13,000
I came to the studio tonight and usually by the time I get here, which is about 5.15ish,

3160
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:18,000
I'm helping Dark Sakura set up kind of the studio and the mic and get the computer on and everything.

3161
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Tonight it was already done.

3162
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:23,000
And I'm thinking, something's up.

3163
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Either this is my Christmas present.

3164
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:31,000
So something's going on. I'm joking obviously. But what's going on you guys?

3165
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Well, we've had our long running segment of my blog, which is Monday Comic Mania.

3166
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:43,000
And it's just where Dark Sakura and I kind of blog about upcoming comics in the week.

3167
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:50,000
And so we decided like last week when I was there to just kind of play around with the idea of doing a podcast of it.

3168
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
And we got a lot of positive feedback.

3169
02:59:52,000 --> 03:00:01,000
So we are starting to do that on a regular basis and we actually did record our second episode today.

3170
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
It was pretty fun too.

3171
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
So where can they download the podcast if they want to check that out?

3172
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:10,000
If they want to check that out, they can go to AvengersTower.com.

3173
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:15,000
I see what's going on here. You're trying to ninja Dark Sakura from our show. That's what's going on.

3174
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Well, to be fair, I've known Dark Sakura longer than you have.

3175
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
Alright. Oh, touche.

3176
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:21,000
Yeah, Rob.

3177
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:26,000
Touche. Alright, no. I obviously am a big fan of independent podcasting. I think that's great.

3178
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:32,000
So she's allowed to have a, I don't want to say a solo project because that's not what it is, but a side project.

3179
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:33,000
An affiliate program.

3180
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:34,000
That's right.

3181
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:42,000
You know, we did want to ask you to be the voice of our introduction for our podcast. So we would love to have you do that.

3182
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Well, that's a very lovely compliment and I would love to do that. Just let me know what you need me to say and I'll record that for you, okay?

3183
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
I told you beforehand.

3184
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:54,000
Oh, yeah. You need, you want me to do it after the show tonight. I'll be happy to do that for you tonight. Sure. Sure.

3185
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Great. Well, thank you guys.

3186
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:56,000
No problem.

3187
03:00:56,000 --> 03:01:01,000
Alright, ToaGak in our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com wants us to fight over Dark Sakura.

3188
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:07,000
So we will have to settle this in a battle of strip poker, clearly, is the only possible answer.

3189
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:11,000
Alright, we'll make it a date next time that I'm up in Sacramento.

3190
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
It's going to be one hot date. Yeah.

3191
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Oh, baby.

3192
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
And no, it will not be broadcast on the internet.

3193
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:20,000
Alright. No, Maren, thank you so much for the call. You take care and have a great new year, okay?

3194
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:21,000
You too. Thanks.

3195
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Later.

3196
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Bochi Kawa in chat says they're just trying to bribe me with the introduction speech.

3197
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Alright, let's get to another call. I think this is going to be our last call of the night.

3198
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:37,000
And from what I understand, the 1877 number is not working and I apologize for that. I don't know what the hell's going on.

3199
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:41,000
That would be one of those things I don't find out about until the show starts, so I apologize.

3200
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Anyhow, Rama, you're on the phone. What's up?

3201
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Well, you couldn't have an end-of-year show without me, guys.

3202
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:52,000
You do seem like a fitting personality to have here at the end of the year. What's on your mind?

3203
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:57,000
Not too much. I just want to give what I thought was my game of the year.

3204
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
Well, please, what was your game of the year?

3205
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Ghostbusters, the video game.

3206
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:03,000
That was awesome.

3207
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:06,000
You know what's funny? Yes, it was.

3208
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:09,000
What was about this game? What made it so goddamn awesome?

3209
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:17,000
You know how whenever you do a movie to video game, the video game generally sucks donkey balls.

3210
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Ghostbusters the video game was one of those shining gems where it came out really good.

3211
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:31,000
Granted, it's not really based off the movie. On the same token, it's like a sequel to the first two movies.

3212
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:37,000
But you still kind of go through elements of the first two movies as you play the game, which I thought was fun.

3213
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:43,000
But game of the year, Rama? Is that enough to make this game of the year?

3214
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:46,000
What is it about the game itself that just made you go,

3215
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:49,000
you know, above everything else I played this year, I love this the most?

3216
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:53,000
Well, number one, I'm not a sports fan.

3217
03:02:53,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Number two, I am an RPG fan, but I can't sit there and play them enough to say that so-and-so RPG is game of the year.

3218
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:06,000
And I'm kind of fed up with all the music, band, games, so on and so forth.

3219
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:11,000
Are you still there? Hello?

3220
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,000
Yeah, I'm right here.

3221
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
Oh, God, it sounded like you cut out for a minute there. I was like, ah!

3222
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Sorry.

3223
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:22,000
No, that's okay. It's just up your genre. It's the genre you want to do and you're just kind of sick of the other saturated genres.

3224
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:23,000
Well, that's fair enough.

3225
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:27,000
What about the bigger question? I don't know if you gave this any thought, but what about the game of the decade?

3226
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:30,000
Game of the decade, wow.

3227
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:31,000
I know, this is so much.

3228
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
Wow.

3229
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:41,000
I don't think I can really pinpoint a game of the decade. I don't think I really could. I'd actually have to sit there and think about that.

3230
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:49,000
You know, I don't think a lot of people could truly, even though we read this list off of Yahoo and so forth and said, you know, they did a pretty good job at least of where to start,

3231
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:55,000
I don't think you will truly be able to know what the biggest games of the decade were until about five years from now,

3232
03:03:55,000 --> 03:04:01,000
when you're really able to look back, accurately look back and say, okay, what games really shaped where we're at now?

3233
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:08,000
You can kind of do that a little bit with the earlier games in the decade. For instance, we were having a chat earlier about how Diablo 2 ultimately shaped World of Warcraft.

3234
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:17,000
You know, I think it'll be interesting to see, because if some of these things like Natal and the Sony ice cream cone fail,

3235
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:22,000
then you can say that maybe Wii Sports wasn't as big as we thought it was. Maybe it really was just a flash in the pan.

3236
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:26,000
But if these two things blow up, then it kind of adds value to Wii Sports in a way.

3237
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:35,000
Pretty much. I mean, I can't really say on the PC side of things with Diablo, because I grew up mostly doing console gaming.

3238
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:40,000
And I had a PC, but nothing worthy of playing half these games that are out there.

3239
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:45,000
And when I saw some of these games in the store, I was always drawing towards the console games.

3240
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:51,000
Yeah, and that's a lot of people in that same boat. There's a lot of people also the exact opposite.

3241
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:56,000
They just can't get into the consoles. They have to play on the PC with the keyboard and the mouse, or it just doesn't work.

3242
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:59,000
It's one of the reasons why I don't play Halo.

3243
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:07,000
Alright. Well, Rama, you're going to be the last call of the year. Do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

3244
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:14,000
Yeah, a couple of things. Number one, a few podcast episodes back, you had mentioned whatever happened to Trade West.

3245
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Yes.

3246
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:21,000
I think a couple of years after they did Double Dragon, they were acquired by Midway.

3247
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:24,000
Oh, okay. Alright.

3248
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:28,000
So they're pretty much no more, is my assumption.

3249
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:33,000
Sure, sure. And that makes sense, because I want to say Midway did some Double Dragon games later on, so that makes total sense.

3250
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:42,000
And last thing I'll leave this note on to you, Jamie, Matt, thank you.

3251
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
You're welcome.

3252
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:45,000
You're welcome.

3253
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:57,000
No, really. I mean, I tune in every Sunday to listen to you guys talk about gaming, and from time to time, you guys move off of gaming, talk about stuff in your personal lives, which do affect all of us.

3254
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:05,000
And I like the fact that we can come together as a family and discuss some of these things, like Proposition 8 and so forth.

3255
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:21,000
That was something I really appreciate, so it was like that one time, take DV from the gaming, talk about something that's more important, more of an impact in our lives that we need to discuss, and see how we all feel about that.

3256
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:26,000
So that's something I appreciate, and you know what, thank you.

3257
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:39,000
Well, thank you very much. It makes us feel very good about what we do, certainly, and I know that sometimes I'm kind of joking. Sometimes my role on the show is to try and make sure we get back to the games at some point.

3258
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:52,000
Obviously, I've certainly, with some of the things you mentioned, kind of gone astray myself, and I'm really thankful that the audience has let us do that, has come to grow to let us do that, and not expect that we're just going to be all games all the time.

3259
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:59,000
But I think it really speaks, especially this time of year. These are the types of things we think about as the family and what's important to us.

3260
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:14,000
And I think there is a sense of family in our listenership that is astounding, and it's been something that's kind of grown through this whole decade, and it's going to continue on over the next few...

3261
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:15,000
We are the LL Army.

3262
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:16,000
That's right.

3263
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:28,000
It's like, you know, at first I felt like I should be kind of offended that you're bringing in personal stuff, but then I realized, if you guys don't talk about it and bring it up, who is? I mean, we all listen to you guys.

3264
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:35,000
You're like the voice of gaming to us, you know? We're like one giant, happy mafia family.

3265
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:39,000
Oh God, don't put that responsibility on us or we might get scared. No, I...

3266
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:42,000
I've already got a whole bag full of tattoos now.

3267
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
That's what's up.

3268
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:52,000
You know what's funny is that, you know, and I've said this before, and I know I've gotten into this story on the show a million times, but the very first episode of Orange Lawns Radio, there were 12 people listening.

3269
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:57,000
And we thought we were fucking rock stars because I was like, whoa, double digits. We fucking rock.

3270
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:01,000
You know, like I honestly thought it was like the best thing ever.

3271
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:06,000
But, you know, at the end of the day, I think there were seriously some episodes where we had more people at the house during the taping.

3272
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:10,000
Remember the house we used to do the show from the very beginning? Then there were people that were listening.

3273
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:17,000
But it was just kind of about getting together and having fun and not really caring about the listeners as a number.

3274
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
Not the listener count.

3275
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:23,000
Yeah, as a number, as an inanimate object that you couldn't really see.

3276
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:32,000
But kind of watching it grow and then kind of get big with the whole podcasting thing into an audience that really interacts with us and so forth has been just really amazing.

3277
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:42,000
Well, it's like every single person that listens to us is a person, not a statistic. You know, we may say, oh, well, 90 people tuned in this week. Yay.

3278
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:51,000
And, oh, this many people downloaded it. But each and every one of you listening to this, either recorded or live right now, you are a person.

3279
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:57,000
And I appreciate that you're all taking time out of your day to dedicate a little time to us.

3280
03:08:57,000 --> 03:09:03,000
Not just a little time. This show's fucking long. I don't know if you're aware, but like three, it's up four hours sometimes.

3281
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:09,000
It's an exchange. We'll dedicate our time to you. You dedicate some time to us and it works.

3282
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:12,000
And that really is all we've ever asked. You know, tell people about the show. Help spread the word.

3283
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:15,000
And send me donuts. I really like donuts.

3284
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:25,000
It's a quick little exchange. I mean, I don't mean to cut you guys off, but through the various jobs I've had, as long as I've been listening to the show, I've made sure that I would arrange my schedule so I would listen to you guys.

3285
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:30,000
I stopped what I do on Sundays to come in here and be with you guys, you know?

3286
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:36,000
If it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be able to do my own podcast. I mean, I thank you guys for that, you know?

3287
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:41,000
I mean, if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be able to do this, you know?

3288
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
We want you to come back and see us too.

3289
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
Because Fannie Mae was a blast.

3290
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:53,000
I'm planning on it. And working on bringing Jodea, Misty, I'm working on it one way or another.

3291
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:58,000
Even if that means I've got to pack them in boxes and ship them metal here, Solid Snake style.

3292
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:01,000
We'll be there for the 4th of July, you know?

3293
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
Alright. I'm holding you to that.

3294
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:09,000
Dude, I'm actually wanting to get to New York. I mean, I would love to find my way up there sometime.

3295
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:15,000
You know, it's been since I was 17 years old was the last time. The one and only time, I think.

3296
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:19,000
No, I went once when I was an infant, so therefore I don't remember it.

3297
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:22,000
But that was the last time I went to New York.

3298
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:28,000
Look at it this way, Amy. If you come out here, Patty has a room just for you.

3299
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:32,000
The bed is ready and everything. It says Dark Soccer Guest Room right there.

3300
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
Really?

3301
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,000
So who's got $400 I can borrow, huh?

3302
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Sister Act is supposed to be on Broadway this next year. I'm coming out there to see that, you know that.

3303
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:43,000
Alright, anyhow, Rama, this is also going on the longest call of the decade.

3304
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:45,000
So I have to say, thank you.

3305
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:46,000
I'm sorry.

3306
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:48,000
No, it was all worth it. Thank you. Have a wonderful night.

3307
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:51,000
And thank you for being a long time supporter of the show. We really appreciate it.

3308
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:54,000
And really a lot of people that called in tonight were in that same boat.

3309
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:55,000
So thank you, Rama. Take care.

3310
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
Have fun. Take care.

3311
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:00,000
Again, apologies to those that didn't get through.

3312
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:04,000
And apologies that the 877 number apparently was borked and I was unaware.

3313
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:08,000
I didn't do that on purpose. Apologize to you guys who weren't able to get through because of that.

3314
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:12,000
But we are going to leave it at that note. Of course we'll be back here next week.

3315
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:17,000
We always are. To do it all again. Take more calls. Do more emails. Do it again.

3316
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:21,000
Until our lives change and we're just not able to do it anymore.

3317
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:24,000
Don't know when that's going to be. I don't want to focus on that right now.

3318
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:27,000
Let's just focus on what a great decade it's been for video games.

3319
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:30,000
And it's just going to continue to grow and who knows what the future holds.

3320
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:32,000
It's going to be crazy.

3321
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:35,000
Well, it's that part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3322
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:39,000
Actually, quickly, are there any last minute stories? I forgot to have Loki clear those out.

3323
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:43,000
Just really quickly, stupid things. Like I mentioned before, Dark Void.

3324
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:49,000
Coming out from Capcom. There is also going to be a DSI game coming out as well for Dark Void.

3325
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:54,000
That's being done in the 8-bit retro style. And it's going to be kind of a side-scroller game.

3326
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:58,000
So that's going to be pretty awesome. That'll be out in January for five bucks.

3327
03:11:58,000 --> 03:11:59,000
It does look neat.

3328
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:04,000
Aliens vs. Predators getting a special limited edition, including a face-hugger.

3329
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,000
Yes, that's right. You get your own very...

3330
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:07,000
I love you!

3331
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:10,000
Your own alien that can hug your face.

3332
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:13,000
And then finally, I just thought this was kind of strange.

3333
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:18,000
Prinny is getting a sequel on the PSP, Prinny 2.

3334
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:25,000
And it's about, apparently, you have to reclaim Aetna's stolen underwear.

3335
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:31,000
Yes, the game is actually called Prinny 2 Dawn of the Great Pantsu War.

3336
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:34,000
And that'll be out in Japan on March 25th.

3337
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:35,000
Pantsu?

3338
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:36,000
Yes.

3339
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:42,000
That's all I had. Oh, and apparently, and I read this and just said,

3340
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:46,000
Eh, that's stupid, but hey, I'll add it to the show roll.

3341
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:53,000
Apparently, John Gosselin's Wii was stolen.

3342
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:59,000
Who gives a shit about that douchebag?

3343
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:06,000
Let him go to the cemetery of news people we just don't care about anymore.

3344
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:10,000
He is no longer relevant. Bam. Done.

3345
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:13,000
Who cares that he had a Wii that got stolen?

3346
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:14,000
Well, sorry.

3347
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:19,000
Sorry, there's also a free New Year's theme for Xbox Live, so you can download that.

3348
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:24,000
Yippie skippy. But look, who cares about some a-hole in his Wii?

3349
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,000
Just forget it.

3350
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:30,000
Although I don't think people should steal things, even if the guy is a douchebag,

3351
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
but now when you steal it, people just report on it.

3352
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:34,000
So now you've done a double bad thing by stealing his Wii.

3353
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:36,000
Rawr.

3354
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:40,000
Anyhow, I don't mean to end this on a negative note, damn you, Loki.

3355
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:44,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3356
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:46,000
Loki, your final thought?

3357
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:52,000
My final thought is I need to install more games on my main cabinet.

3358
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:56,000
My final thought is I hope I get enough sleep, because I've got to go back to work tomorrow.

3359
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:58,000
Boo.

3360
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:00,000
DarkSahara, your final thought?

3361
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:03,000
Uh...

3362
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:07,000
I only have three words, Rob.

3363
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
Reject false icons.

3364
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
A very lovely thought to end on.

3365
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
Guys, don't forget about Orange Launch Revolution's second mix,

3366
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:18,000
the awesome tribute project that's out there that our fans put together.

3367
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:21,000
All the information is available on OrangeLaunchReview.com,

3368
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:24,000
as well as information on the OLR Madness,

3369
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:26,000
what used to be the March Madness.

3370
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:30,000
That event is going on right now, taking your top 25 picks of all time,

3371
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:32,000
and we'll get into that more in future weeks

3372
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:36,000
when we're not so focused on the weeks and the decades and so forth.

3373
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,000
Check out all that on Orange Launch Radio.

3374
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:42,000
Again, if you like the show, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.

3375
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
Thank you guys so much.

3376
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:46,000
Here we are 350 episodes later,

3377
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:50,000
and we're looking forward to doing episode 351 next week.

3378
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:53,000
So we'll be here same time next week to do it all over again,

3379
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:55,000
right after Bobby Black Wolf.

3380
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:59,000
Until then, have a great and safe new year,

3381
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:02,000
and we will see you next decade.

3382
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:04,000
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

3383
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:10,000
