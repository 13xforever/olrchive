00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:18,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, December 27th, 2009, Pac-Man might soon fight at Battle Royale.

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Could your portable games soon be banned on airplanes?

3
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:22,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we take a look back

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:42,506
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live with our 350th episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 27th of 2009.

6
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:44,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're here for the holidays.

7
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:49,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Broadcasting live every Sunday night, www.allgames.com.

8
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:55,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We're an All Games Radio affiliate and we are very thankful that they let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night to do our little program.

9
00:00:56,133 --> 00:01:00,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining you over the next few hours, myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only...

10
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:01,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie Summers, DarkSakura

11
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

12
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:30,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why we're not hearing you at all tonight.

13
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:34,127
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the wonders of live radio, is that sometimes you get technical difficulties, things happen.

14
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:35,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes people play with my volume, apparently.

15
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:36,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently?

16
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:37,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's up with that.

17
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:43,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what's going on is that behind our backs, DarkSakura has been secretly taping another show.

18
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:43,870
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

19
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.

20
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just screwing with some of the audio settings.

21
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:48,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't touch Loki's.

22
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:50,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.

23
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:50,492
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

24
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:51,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Try again, Loki.

25
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:51,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll hear you now.

26
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:52,492
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

27
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:53,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, now we hear you too much.

28
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:54,153
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's really loud.

29
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:54,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're good now.

30
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:57,214
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Loki?

31
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:57,655
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

32
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:58,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm alright.

33
00:01:58,316 --> 00:01:59,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have a good holiday?

34
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:00,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

35
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:02,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Santa bring you lots of good stuff for the holidays?

36
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Pots and stuff to do yard work.

37
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Santa brought you pot?

38
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:11,650
[SPEAKER_03]: No, like pots and pans.

39
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:12,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

40
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in time for New Year's, Rob.

41
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:16,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,921
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:50,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I also pre-ordered... I hate the word pre-order.

44
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:56,429
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just ordered my copy in advance of Star Trek Online.

45
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,776
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently if you do the order through Amazon or through I guess any of the others, you'll get like a thing to do the beta.

46
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:08,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to be in the beta.

47
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,189
[SPEAKER_09]: When's the beta start?

48
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:09,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember.

49
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:12,651
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many like... January something, something-teenth.

50
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:17,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Closed beta and open beta and retweet to get in the OMG right now betas.

51
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:19,576
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many betas going on.

52
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:23,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm in the 80s all over again and VHS is just around the corner.

53
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,280
[SPEAKER_09]: It's January something-teenth.

54
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:25,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

55
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:26,421
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

56
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:26,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

57
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:27,562
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so helpful.

58
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:32,425
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also got... Dan picked up for me...

59
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, it has to be the collector's edition.

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for you to get the beta?

61
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:39,684
[SPEAKER_09]: To get the beta.

62
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:40,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I see, okay.

63
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:40,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is what I got.

64
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:42,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what I imagine a lot of people are getting anyway.

65
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,946
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dan picked up for me the Silent Hill game on Wii, so I need people to come over and hold my hand while I play it.

66
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:54,310
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I watched a friend play that game a couple days ago, and it was very strange.

67
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the nightmare sequence happen, and it's weird.

68
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:01,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't get all rusty, it's just snowy in that game.

69
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:07,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just running through doors, over and over, running through doors, running through doors, running through doors, trying to avoid zombies.

70
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:08,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this is...

71
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:09,903
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really run.

72
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:15,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you do run in Silent Hill, but this felt like an action game or something.

73
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,365
[SPEAKER_02]: It was strange.

74
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:18,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play it, I watched.

75
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,667
[SPEAKER_09]: It shatters your memories of Silent Hill.

76
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,448
[SPEAKER_09]: How about that?

77
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,308
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a bug about to crawl into your hair behind you.

78
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:25,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Gross!

79
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:26,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Gross!

80
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Our studio's infested!

81
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:29,331
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not infested.

82
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:30,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a tissue, you big baby.

83
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,671
[SPEAKER_02]: There's bugs in our studio!

84
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:37,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, is that what you plan to end the decade with?

85
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer bugs?

86
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:39,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Destroy the host?

87
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, it probably snuck in through the window.

88
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,676
[SPEAKER_08]: No, kill it, you big baby.

89
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:45,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I'm going to take a picture of it to show the listeners how big this scary bug is.

90
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:46,619
Fuck.

91
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure to zoom in.

92
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else for your gaming week, DarkSakura?

93
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:55,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I played the game where I laugh about Rob being a big baby.

94
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, it's a big scary bug.

95
00:04:57,526 --> 00:05:02,429
[SPEAKER_09]: We also played some Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, which was really good.

96
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:05,811
[SPEAKER_02]: When I upload this to the feed, it's going to look like a big poop on your curtain.

97
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:08,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kill it already, Rob.

98
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a pincher?

99
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:10,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kill it.

100
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:11,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

101
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:12,034
[SPEAKER_02]: It better not.

102
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,715
[SPEAKER_02]: If it pinches, I'm going to scream.

103
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here.

104
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:16,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me the napkin.

105
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:17,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold my mic.

106
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:18,678
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura saves the day.

107
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I should just let it do its thing.

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't.

109
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:27,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a scary bug!

110
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,535
[SPEAKER_02]: But pinchers pinch, that's why they're called pinchers.

111
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:39,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that our show has been sufficiently derailed for the decade, Loki, how was your gaming week?

112
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It was alright.

113
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:41,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't play a whole lot.

114
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I played more Grand Theft Auto this week.

115
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:44,934
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what little I could.

116
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:45,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It went crunch.

117
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:52,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I brought my 360 home hoping to play more stuff, but I just didn't because I ended up messing around with other things.

118
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played a little bit of Little Big Planet, the new Pirates of the Caribbean water stuff.

119
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:00,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It's neat.

120
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:04,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as exciting as, you know, the Paintnator, but, you know, how can you top guns?

121
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:05,388
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't.

122
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty...

123
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:08,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

124
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:48,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I did at some point so that's kind of neat but I was going to play also Mod Nation Racers and granted I did all this like an hour before the show so I meant to play Mod Nation Racers as well because I'm in the beta for that however since I haven't played LittleBigPlanet in forever I had to download the updates which took 15 minutes oh jeez yeah I can imagine so I was just you know what hey props to them because that means they have just been putting update after update after update on that game you know tons of updates yeah

125
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:55,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think the last time I downloaded the update was update 1.05, and they're up to 1.23 now.

126
00:06:56,111 --> 00:07:05,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bummer, though, it's not smart enough to just go, okay, I'm going to download the patch that takes you from 1.05 all the way up to, without having to download five patches in between.

127
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:07,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that, yeah.

128
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:09,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes PC games do that, especially MMOs.

129
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:11,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic!

130
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:29,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic, yes, perfect example.

131
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:32,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Pirates of the Caribbean stuff's kind of neat.

132
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:39,353
[SPEAKER_03]: The characters, obviously, they don't really have anything that looks too much like the stuff in the movie, but the same typical plot.

133
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:42,538
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the two royal guards or whatever, the

134
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:48,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Imperial Guards or whoever they are from the movie are in there and that kind of thing.

135
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:52,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I only got to play the first level though before I wanted to move on to other things.

136
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:56,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I actually played a little bit on the arcade cabinet.

137
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:00,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a friend over and we were testing out my...

138
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:11,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Newly souped up joysticks because I added octagonal restrictors in them now and also tighter springs.

139
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:17,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I did everything except for take apart the actual push buttons to put the little paper in there and stuff.

140
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:22,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I just don't want to mess with that because I have a feeling it's going to fall apart after a while and it's enough.

141
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:52,161
[SPEAKER_03]: so uh played Marvel vs. Capcom 1 and uh I'm not very good at it I like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 but I you know I couldn't figure out why I didn't have it yet and it's because I don't have any Naomi games yet and so that's what I basically spent most of the holiday doing was downloading Naomi games and downloading um you know Sega Model A games and you know Zinc Emulation games and all sorts of crap um

142
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:54,197
[SPEAKER_03]: to put on the cabinet.

143
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and CPS3 stuff, so I have Street Fighter 3 and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and all that fun stuff.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, actual game, though, I did play.

145
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,681
[SPEAKER_03]: We played all the way through Simpsons, the arcade game on MAME, so that was fun.

146
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:08,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I love playing through that.

147
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:09,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

148
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:14,003
[SPEAKER_02]: You know there's a Simpsons arcade on iPhone now, but it's not even the same thing.

149
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:19,445
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the same name, and I think it's definitely inspired by the old arcade game, but it's not...

150
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:20,765
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

151
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

152
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:45,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I love playing the game.

153
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,198
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of fun playing it.

154
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,701
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.

155
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of other stuff.

156
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,869
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just trying a bunch of random games on there.

157
00:09:55,369 --> 00:10:22,494
[SPEAKER_03]: MissWorldNude96 didn't play that but the problem is, see right now I'm going through my list of games I have on there because there's a ton of games, first off clones that I have on there that I need to get rid of and I got rid of them on one list but I need to get rid of them on the list that's for my front end so that they don't display on there and then also a whole bunch of Mahjong games and crap I'm not going to play so I have to go through and delete all that stuff or stuff that just doesn't work um

158
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,816
[SPEAKER_03]: You sound like me trying to organize my iTunes library.

159
00:10:47,172 --> 00:11:04,920
[SPEAKER_02]: a friend of mine inspired me to organize my iTunes a little better and I've been trying to do that and it is a mess like I have all these misspelled artists and albums and trying to get the right album art and things from compilations and it's a pain in the ass it sounds very similar just what you're describing is going through that whole process

160
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it'll be nice when it's done.

161
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:10,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, I'm really excited to try some of these new Naomi games.

162
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:12,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of them don't necessarily work.

163
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:17,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have one emulator for Naomi disc-based games and Dreamcast games.

164
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:20,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have another emulator for Naomi cartridge games.

165
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of those work and some of them don't.

166
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:28,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the ones that will work, though, like Ikaruga, Marvel vs. Capcom 2...

167
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:33,210
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some I haven't even heard of before.

168
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:36,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of these really crazy shooter games.

169
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:43,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, you know, just some of the normal ones like Senkei no Ronde or Rondo, I believe, in...

170
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Radio Allergy or Radigy or whatever.

171
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:53,072
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the cave shooters and stuff like that.

172
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,573
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be kind of cool to put in there.

173
00:11:55,593 --> 00:12:05,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially now that I have the heavy springs on the joysticks for really twitchy movements and stuff that will really come in handy for shooters and stuff.

174
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:09,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, just lots of downloading stuff for the cabinet.

175
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:12,778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's mainly what I've been doing during the break and a little bit

176
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I still haven't played Borderlands.

177
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:17,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'm gonna play Borderlands this break!

178
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:18,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna do it!

179
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done it yet.

180
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:21,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even brought home, like, Bayonetta.

181
00:12:21,753 --> 00:12:23,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, I'm gonna play Bayonetta.

182
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,517
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have, um... What was it?

183
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:28,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Oto... Was it Otomedius?

184
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorgeous.

185
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:32,842
[SPEAKER_03]: The Konami shooter that has, like, chicks flying around.

186
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:33,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna play that.

187
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:34,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh...

188
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:36,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Just didn't get around to it.

189
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,994
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

190
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:10,276
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my friends actually did some testing for a while.

191
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:13,299
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, I'm so sick of playing soccer.

192
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:14,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing or reviewing.

193
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sometimes, you know, that, God, that's a discussion for a whole other show.

194
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:19,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I was even trying to get into strategy guides.

195
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:21,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that, yeah.

196
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:27,770
[SPEAKER_09]: And, like, they'll have you review, like, they'll just play through some of the most meh games, so.

197
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

198
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:29,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I still want to do that, though.

199
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:30,612
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.

200
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:31,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be fun.

201
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:32,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, sorry, Loki.

202
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:33,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you wanted to say about your gaming week?

203
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:36,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's basically it.

204
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just lots of downloading stuff, and I'm sure none of that's legal because, you know, they're ROMs and, you know, whatever.

205
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:45,671
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know what?

206
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:51,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go buy multi-thousand dollar worth of arcade boards.

207
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:59,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on the show, and if you are listening live to us on All Games Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, head on over to our chat room.

208
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:13,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the easiest way to get there, or if you know your IRC, you just want to join the Game Surge Network on IRCGameSurge.net, and we are in Channel Pound Orange Lounge is the name of our chat room.

209
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:19,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, reading some comments from chat, it went all the way back up here, talking about...

210
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:23,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Tigerclaw had said that it's appropriate.

211
00:14:23,304 --> 00:14:23,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

212
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:26,786
[SPEAKER_02]: What a way to start the last show of the new year or decade with a bug.

213
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to the bug.

214
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:33,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know how sometimes music will sometimes play when it's not supposed to here on the show.

215
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, whoops, live radio.

216
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

217
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the joys of live radio.

218
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:42,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Also reading some comments from chat.

219
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:47,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray Iannami in our chatroom says, PS, get your asses to SVGL, Sunnyvale Golf Land.

220
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,071
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a Simpsons machine here.

221
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:50,031
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting?

222
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:53,632
[SPEAKER_02]: There is Simpsons machines kind of still out there all over.

223
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw one randomly.

224
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at this hotel near Disneyland staying.

225
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,594
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a game room in the hotel.

226
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:04,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a game room in a hotel that wasn't a casino since I was a teenager.

227
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a very long time.

228
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:06,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

229
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:13,532
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first times we went to Disneyland, there was a hotel that we stayed in that had a game room and I'd go down there.

230
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:15,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it was the same hotel.

231
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:16,124
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have been.

232
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:16,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

233
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:16,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

234
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:17,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It was near the convention center.

235
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:18,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

236
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:19,005
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably don't even remember.

237
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the convention center wasn't built when I think.

238
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:21,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

239
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:21,626
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

240
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:21,927
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

241
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:22,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyhow.

242
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Simpsons arcade game, obviously, a lot of people really remember this.

243
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:29,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still in arcades and probably still freaking makes money.

244
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,612
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, this machine at this particular hotel, their game room was in pretty sad shape.

245
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:35,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Like half the machines weren't working.

246
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:38,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Simpsons one was, but it was where the monitor was like...

247
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:45,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So bright you could not like it's just faded over time, but it hasn't faded dark.

248
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:45,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's faded light.

249
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:48,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what causes that maybe sun fading or something.

250
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:50,727
[SPEAKER_12]: They probably in the dark room.

251
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:54,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it probably what happened was it burned in and they just turned the brightness up.

252
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:56,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I see to try and avoid that.

253
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:57,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

254
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:00,236
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week, some of the things I played this week.

255
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play a couple new games.

256
00:16:02,557 --> 00:16:06,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously Steam is having an obscene sale right now as DarkSakura mentioned earlier.

257
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:07,259
[SPEAKER_02]: She picked up Braid.

258
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:11,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked up Luminous because the basic and advanced pack were on sale a couple days ago for $3.

259
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:15,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, what the hell, I own Luminous on just about every other platform.

260
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:16,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get it on PC as well.

261
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:18,664
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was cool.

262
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:19,644
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same game.

263
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:22,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly plays better than the iPhone one, although I still think...

264
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:24,786
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

265
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:51,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Other stuff I played this week.

266
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:55,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Saw a demo for a game called Crayon Physics, which was also on Steam.

267
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting.

268
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:04,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very DS-inspired game because you would basically have this little ball on your screen that you had to get the ball to the star.

269
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And you did that by drawing ramps.

270
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:08,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it was kind of interesting.

271
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:09,095
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have a little...

272
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:11,668
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

273
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:30,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly, you know, not everybody owns a DS, but a lot of people own a PC.

274
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a way for you to get into those kinds of games.

275
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt the game was a little basic.

276
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And the music was kind of crack.

277
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:44,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was really, like, trippy, scary almost, how happy trippy it was.

278
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit frightening.

279
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Best description ever.

280
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:48,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy trippy.

281
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:48,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

282
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:49,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy trippy.

283
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:50,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Look.

284
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:54,215
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually going to be 2DX 19th style or whatever they're up to now.

285
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:54,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy trippy.

286
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:54,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

287
00:17:57,562 --> 00:18:24,281
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura holds up the thumb hat as she's talking there so happy trippy thumb hat 2DX19 style let's see what other games did I play this week Tekken 6 I checked out for a little bit I have to admit my reaction to Tekken 6 after having spent a little time with it is lol what like that was honestly pretty much the reaction I had every few minutes we were playing Tekken 6 lol what

288
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:29,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude is wearing pink pants and shoots electricity out of his hands while he's standing in water.

289
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Lol what?

290
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:38,449
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a giant transformer guy who shoots laser beams into the floor that makes me fall through and I instantly lose.

291
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Lol what?

292
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:47,650
[SPEAKER_02]: The Last Boss Looks Like Zombie, Big Bird, 8, like Raw from Stargate, and is glowing blue.

293
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Lol what is this game?

294
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:51,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we have any Voldo?

295
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:54,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Bondage Crotch?

296
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:56,396
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 40 fucking characters in the game.

297
00:18:56,476 --> 00:18:59,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, Tekken has obviously been lol what for a little while.

298
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:03,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It's had the panda bears and the kangaroos.

299
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Voldo was so caliber, but I know that they brought in...

300
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Like some of the really weird ones.

301
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:11,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, of course, anything with Yoshimitsu in it's going to be... The training dummy.

302
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:13,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you play as Panda?

303
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:15,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play as Panda.

304
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:18,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I played with my favorite tranny bitch, Anna Williams.

305
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:22,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm telling you, in Tekken 6, she is one fierce transsexual.

306
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,036
[SPEAKER_02]: No dis... Obviously, I mean no disrespect.

307
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:31,681
[SPEAKER_02]: She just looks like your stereotypical, like, wearing all the leopard stuff and the boots and all that.

308
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:35,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And she just... Like, literally, one of her moves... You know how everybody has a throw?

309
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:35,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

310
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:36,424
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

311
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel, Angel, Angel

312
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:24,857
[SPEAKER_02]: from like 1981 where she's a prostitute by night and an FBI agent by day.

313
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:27,518
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way I could describe Anna Williams.

314
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:29,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

315
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:29,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Lol what?

316
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:33,340
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty much my review of Tekken 6.

317
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Lol what?

318
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:41,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I thought it was interesting that in certain parts of the game if you're playing offline mode it kind of simulates an online mode.

319
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:47,266
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be playing against people with these fake gamer tags that you're playing for promotions and

320
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:49,779
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

321
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,741
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is actually a lot more deep than I'm giving it credit for.

322
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:16,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind I only looked at a couple modes on this particular outing with the game.

323
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't really get too in-depth with the game, but yeah.

324
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Lol, what?

325
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,326
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

326
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:27,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, AlphaCanadagram in chat says, Sky, it's ghost data of players.

327
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:29,629
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of strange to me.

328
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:31,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are they actual real people?

329
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:37,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I saw, like, at signs and other signs I didn't think you could have in your gamer tag as part of the...

330
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:39,722
[SPEAKER_02]: What if I don't want my...

331
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:56,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost to be online.

332
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:59,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitstun says, pretty cool, but they really only copy the user's combos.

333
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:02,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Which really is what Tekken's all about.

334
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:10,558
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not, you know, Tekken is not the fighting game with fireballs and, you know, all these insane moves.

335
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:14,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, there's only low punch, high punch, low kick, high kick.

336
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:16,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are pretty much all the buttons you use to do everything in Tekken.

337
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:20,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just string all these combos and juggle, etc., etc.

338
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:20,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

339
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:27,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Alphacanatagram also adds in Tekken 6 has been in arcades for years, so they get data from arcade machines.

340
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:28,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

341
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:29,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

342
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:33,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess having that kind of come to light, obviously the game doesn't explain that to you.

343
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:39,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that feature to be very interesting, but it doesn't really change my little what reaction to the game.

344
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:41,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, um...

345
00:22:43,257 --> 00:23:06,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, other games I played this week A lot of World of Warcraft still I already have a level 80 character I've had one for a couple years But now my new character I'm trying to get to 80 My paladin, my dwarf paladin She is level 78 Two bubbles away from 79 Very, very close to level 80 And I'm excited because I'll actually be able to use the new dungeon finder with that Hold on, I've got something for you guys Oh?

346
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fill time

347
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to actually mention something about this.

348
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:17,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Warcraft and all this stuff, I don't usually listen to other podcasts, and I've kind of talked about why on the show before.

349
00:23:18,154 --> 00:23:23,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean obviously I listen to Bobby Blackwolf because he's live before we are, and I listen to most of his show because of that.

350
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:28,760
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to inadvertently take ideas from other shows or what have you and all this other stuff.

351
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:31,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, thank you.

352
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:33,202
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's handing out presents.

353
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:33,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

354
00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:34,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I'll open that in a minute.

355
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:43,204
[SPEAKER_02]: But on Christmas Day, Scott Rubin, who's the ringleader of AllGames.com, if you weren't already aware, was doing like a marathon live show.

356
00:23:43,244 --> 00:23:45,204
[SPEAKER_02]: He was live for like five or six hours that day.

357
00:23:45,744 --> 00:23:48,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually called him and talked to him for a little while.

358
00:23:48,105 --> 00:23:48,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

359
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure it'll be archived on AllGamesRadio's site.

360
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:52,826
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check that out.

361
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:55,046
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked a long time about digital distribution.

362
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:56,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's very pro-digital distribution.

363
00:23:57,946 --> 00:23:59,467
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little lively debate about that.

364
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:24,513
[SPEAKER_02]: but I tuned in later on the iPhone app in my car because I was driving to San Francisco Christmas night and I wanted to listen to more like talk radio I thought would be good for the drive but he wasn't on anymore instead this other program was on uh talking about nothing but World of Warcraft and uh it's called the Warcraft Outsiders which I think is a spin-off of Video Game Outsiders another um all games radio program on the network I have to say you know I

365
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:28,235
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I don't often listen to other podcasts, I thought they did a pretty good job.

366
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:33,119
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew their stuff talking about Warcraft, and I thought it was interesting.

367
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I play the game all the time, I wasn't hearing a lot of news that I didn't already know, but I kind of liked hearing about their experiences.

368
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:46,107
[SPEAKER_02]: The gal they have on that show, I think her name is Michelle, was kind of like the ringleader of that show, at least the particular episode I was listening to.

369
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:48,328
[SPEAKER_02]: She knows her shit on Warcraft.

370
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:48,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I was...

371
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:49,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Very impressed.

372
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,730
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a pretty hardcore raider and all that stuff.

373
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:05,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good show, so I wanted to give them a shout out because we don't often give the other all games radio shows enough shout outs here, but we are all about supporting other independent radio and independent podcasts.

374
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:08,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I say I personally don't listen to a lot of other podcasts doesn't mean you shouldn't.

375
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:12,496
[SPEAKER_02]: You should go out there and support all the other podcasts out there.

376
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you decide Orange Lounge Radio is not your cup of tea, I bet there is another show on the network.

377
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:19,759
[SPEAKER_02]: It is their cup of tea, so check that out.

378
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:23,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.

379
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:23,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what?

380
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:25,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Open present?

381
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Me first or Loki first?

382
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,808
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got your card, so go ahead.

383
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:30,749
[SPEAKER_02]: La la la card.

384
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,371
Crap.

385
00:25:35,132 --> 00:25:38,936
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a card and on the tree it says, wow, those are some really big balls.

386
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:40,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy says, thanks.

387
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:43,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, have a great big Merry Christmas.

388
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:46,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

389
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: The tree had big balls on it.

390
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I just fucked up my little hat.

391
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:51,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to open up this box.

392
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:51,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to ruin it.

393
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,020
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a box, Rob.

394
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,221
[SPEAKER_09]: It costs a dollar.

395
00:25:55,241 --> 00:25:56,421
[SPEAKER_02]: This is terrible radio, though.

396
00:25:57,382 --> 00:25:57,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

397
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:58,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm opening a box, folks.

398
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,245
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not a dick in a box.

399
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:04,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, snap.

400
00:26:05,846 --> 00:26:08,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a... Oh, cool!

401
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:11,208
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft Year of Here.

402
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:11,849
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a...

403
00:26:12,714 --> 00:26:21,437
[SPEAKER_02]: A 365 day calendar, I'm assuming Like a desk calendar That shows little locales in the world of Warcraft I will totally take this to work and they'll really think I'm a freak It'll be awesome

404
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:22,968
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I bought it.

405
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, that's cool.

406
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:25,090
[SPEAKER_09]: For people to think you're a freak.

407
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on Tuesday, the 26th of January, there's a little picture of the Violet Hold.

408
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:33,474
[SPEAKER_02]: On Thursday, the 8th of July, there's a picture of Icecrown Citadel.

409
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:36,015
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have all these little pictures from around Warcraft.

410
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:36,575
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

411
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:38,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw it and I thought you'd appreciate it.

412
00:26:38,276 --> 00:26:39,216
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a vast world in Warcraft.

413
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:40,357
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the reasons to play.

414
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:41,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty awesome.

415
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:41,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

416
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:42,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Open your box, Loki.

417
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:44,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

418
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:45,599
[SPEAKER_03]: My card says bacon.

419
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,300
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd you know?

420
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:50,602
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a dog jumping up and down because he got a box full of bacon.

421
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you get just what you're looking for this Christmas.

422
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:55,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you got?

423
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:56,561
[SPEAKER_02]: A box full of bacon?

424
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

425
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:58,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Open your box!

426
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:00,022
[SPEAKER_09]: What's in the box?

427
00:27:00,082 --> 00:27:01,022
[SPEAKER_09]: What's in the box?

428
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:01,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it!

429
00:27:02,983 --> 00:27:05,543
[SPEAKER_09]: What's in the fucking box?

430
00:27:05,683 --> 00:27:06,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me what's in the box!

431
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:11,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's opening his box very slowly.

432
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:15,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Rob, did you see the thing that I posted on Facebook earlier?

433
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:17,006
[SPEAKER_09]: The 30 seconds of...

434
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:21,274
[SPEAKER_09]: of Lich King.

435
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:25,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the Worst Case Scenario Daily Survival Calendar 2010.

436
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:26,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

437
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:31,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Day-to-day guide to surviving a year's worth of peril.

438
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:35,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't this what inspired your old advice column you used to do?

439
00:27:35,598 --> 00:27:43,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I used to have this calendar a few years ago and I remember just cracking up on a daily basis and I figured that, look, you would appreciate some advice.

440
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, how to deliver a baby in a mall.

441
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

442
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:49,441
[SPEAKER_09]: How to control a runaway camel.

443
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:52,490
[SPEAKER_09]: How to navigate a minefield successfully.

444
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,421
[SPEAKER_09]: and How to Drive Santa's Sleigh.

445
00:27:55,862 --> 00:28:10,772
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can find some old ass episodes of our To Go show, which I think was around 2005, 2006, when we first were getting into podcasting, we would do like a three to four hour live show, then record another hour that was separately podcast.

446
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:14,235
[SPEAKER_02]: We merged the shows finally, got smart and merged them together finally a couple years later.

447
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:20,680
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can find some old episodes of the To Go show, it was really funny because DarkSakura had these little advice columns that were like,

448
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:25,704
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some pretty appropriate stuff, like for example, New Year's Day.

449
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:30,908
[SPEAKER_03]: It's essential survivor knowledge, appropriate attire for winter weather.

450
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:33,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, this should be the date before.

451
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,672
[SPEAKER_03]: How to carry someone who is passed out.

452
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:38,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Very useful.

453
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:44,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I freaking love worst case scenario, so I thought that maybe Loki would too.

454
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:48,242
[SPEAKER_03]: How to deflect encounter or sword blow.

455
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:53,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it was either that or I was trying to decide who I was going to give the bitch a day calendar to.

456
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:59,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it actually have 365 bitches on it or is it like complaints?

457
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:11,516
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like those magnets that you have the one that says remember when fat butts were in style or the I'm having screaming PMS with a really happy looking 40s chick on there.

458
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,756
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that type of thing.

459
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:15,256
[SPEAKER_09]: It was all stuff like that.

460
00:29:15,597 --> 00:29:17,417
[SPEAKER_03]: How to land a runway hire balloon.

461
00:29:19,082 --> 00:29:19,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case.

462
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:20,303
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know, Loki.

463
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:20,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

464
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:21,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Might need it.

465
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:26,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma in chat is bragging he has all of the OLR2GO podcast.

466
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:28,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there was an archive online somewhere.

467
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's like – and DarkTetsuya is talking about the descriptions on the wiki.

468
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:39,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't talked about this a lot on the show, but on wikia.com, there's actually a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki that you can look up.

469
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:40,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually has like descriptions of –

470
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:42,425
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

471
00:30:01,462 --> 00:30:02,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's the baby on your screen right now on Facebook?

472
00:30:02,963 --> 00:30:05,324
[SPEAKER_09]: That's our friend Megumi's baby, Luke.

473
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:06,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww, that's cute.

474
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:14,970
[SPEAKER_02]: He's cute, and it was great radio, but... Although that reaction is somewhat like, did you ever see Batboy on the World News cover?

475
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:15,571
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

476
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:16,812
[SPEAKER_02]: With the face?

477
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,873
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a cute little baby yawn.

478
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:21,816
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

479
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:25,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

480
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we're on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

481
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:30,759
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a Facebook now, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

482
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,580
[SPEAKER_02]: You should definitely follow us on those sites.

483
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,982
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will still be here live next Sunday and the Sunday after.

484
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:45,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not know yet what the plan is for the show on January the – I'm looking at my calendar here – January the 17th.

485
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:49,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear there's a best of in the works, so maybe that'll finally be ready by that week.

486
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

487
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, start us off tonight with some news.

488
00:31:27,963 --> 00:31:36,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom has decided to pull a few games from their Quarter 1 2010 lineup, including Super Street Fighter 4, Lost Planet 2, and Monster Hunter Tri.

489
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:44,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I've seen, they haven't really announced yet when they're going to...

490
00:31:45,928 --> 00:31:47,290
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

491
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:36,493
[SPEAKER_03]: and they said they're planning on spreading them across all four quarters which makes sense if you think about it because Capcom usually front loads the first part of the year with their games and I'm sure that a lot of the stuff that they put out ends up competing with itself so it kind of makes sense that you would want to spread that out and they still do have some stuff coming out in the first quarter they have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Ultimate All-Stars and of course Dark Void coming out as well and that's not even including the

492
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:43,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things that they're planning on releasing digital distribution-wise, including Mega Man 10.

493
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:46,160
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of stuff coming out still.

494
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:50,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a little bit disappointing, though, because when I read the article, what you say makes a lot of sense.

495
00:32:50,824 --> 00:32:55,588
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to load the year too front-heavy, I guess, for lack of a better term.

496
00:32:55,948 --> 00:33:01,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But there were some big, like Super Street Fighter 4, I had the feeling we were going to be playing it come February or March.

497
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:02,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think we may.

498
00:33:02,534 --> 00:33:04,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think it may come out in April or May, not

499
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:10,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising 2 is still at some point, but they have a pretty big slate of games coming up this year.

500
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:11,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

501
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:29,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Not putting them all out at the same time Lots of games got delayed

502
00:33:55,478 --> 00:34:05,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of it's because of Modern Warfare 2, and a lot of people were afraid to kind of take on Modern Warfare 2, and so they've delayed their games to other parts of the year, which is fine, because I think that's good.

503
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:13,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally, we get these really dead months where there's nothing coming out, and I'm like, you know, hey, it'd be the perfect time to put this game out, because there's really nothing competing with it right now.

504
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:16,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, April, I mean, most of April's gonna be pretty dead.

505
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:18,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're gonna have Red Dead Redemption on the 27th, but...

506
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:22,683
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I'm aware, there's normally not much coming out in April.

507
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:24,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty dead.

508
00:34:24,244 --> 00:34:26,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that kind of traditional, though, that not much comes out around that time?

509
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:30,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's when you're starting to get into finals and college, which is your big gaming base.

510
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:32,528
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care about that kind of stuff, though.

511
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,329
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't think that kind of stuff cuts into sales?

512
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:35,469
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think it really matters.

513
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:37,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just development cycles.

514
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:41,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, a lot of the stuff, they try to push it out before the end of March.

515
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

516
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:43,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't Final Fantasy XIII April?

517
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:44,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that March?

518
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:44,934
[SPEAKER_02]: That's March.

519
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:45,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my bad.

520
00:34:46,365 --> 00:35:01,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIII is the beginning of March, but that may be another reason too why some of these delays are happening, because if they're coming out around the same time as Final Fantasy XIII, maybe that's another... It's not as big as Modern Warfare 2, but it's going to be pretty big.

521
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a completely different audience, you know what I mean?

522
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:08,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the kind of people that play Final Fantasy XIII aren't going to play these other types of games.

523
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:10,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, well, you know, there's always somebody that plays both.

524
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:12,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Monster Hunter, I think, kind of, you know, it's a little similar.

525
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:15,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I could see that kind of having some similar crossover.

526
00:35:15,257 --> 00:35:17,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Street Fighter, yeah, not much of a crossover there.

527
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,842
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, though, it's, you know...

528
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:22,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very similar strategy to how they do movies, right?

529
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:44,733
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

530
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:13,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet, or it has been announced, I'm kind of surprised there.

531
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:17,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have thought maybe Crackdown 2 might be coming out.

532
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:24,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Or hey, even, you know, maybe, what was it?

533
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:27,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the name of the game now.

534
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:29,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's all right, because I'm not buying it.

535
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:32,573
[SPEAKER_03]: The other Microsoft, Alan Wake, that's right.

536
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:35,814
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that's been delayed forever, you know.

537
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:37,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably won't be that great.

538
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:38,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it looks all right.

539
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's good that they're delaying stuff just a little bit.

540
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:50,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of sucks because they have to lower their projections for how they're going to finish up their 2010 financial year, but

541
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:55,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

542
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:28,694
[SPEAKER_03]: and um you know I don't think this year is going to be different obviously we're going to have another Call of Duty game and some more Guitar Hero games and some more DJ Hero and who knows what hmm

543
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:33,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely going to be a busy year next year, but then I wonder how much we're going to hear next year.

544
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Delayed again, delayed again, lololol.

545
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,889
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a lot of stuff that's delayed.

546
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:40,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Natal delayed, Sony Motion delayed, hahaha.

547
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:51,941
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing too, there's a lot of that stuff coming out, you know, kind of in the, I want to say it was supposed to be the second quarter, and maybe some of these games are going to use some of that.

548
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:56,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're delaying it because of that, or maybe they're going to delay them to add that kind of stuff, or maybe...

549
00:37:58,084 --> 00:37:59,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man Battle Royale

550
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:17,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know what the heck that could be.

551
00:38:17,357 --> 00:38:19,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Could that be a fighting game involving Pac-Man?

552
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:41,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

553
00:39:01,525 --> 00:39:02,166
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

554
00:39:17,742 --> 00:39:19,043
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a bunch of copies of it.

555
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember how, maybe a chatter remembers this better.

556
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:46,241
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a stack of them and we're giving them out.

557
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you had to get a copy of it somehow.

558
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:53,167
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably had that because of Game Store connections, but there was a way you were supposed to get it.

559
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:55,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was like a pre-order bonus or what.

560
00:39:55,288 --> 00:39:56,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was.

561
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:56,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was too.

562
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:13,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, who knows what this game could be all about, but of course when I hear Pac-Man Battle Royale, I don't know about you guys, but I think about the old Japanese movie where they might strand Pac-Man on a desert island with his peers and give him only a fan to survive.

563
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:15,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper plate.

564
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:20,455
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty amazing if that was actually the case, but I somehow doubt that.

565
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:22,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I've won Paper Plate Battle Royale.

566
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:25,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't see an M-rated Pac-Man game for the life of me.

567
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:25,637
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

568
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:26,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it would be funny.

569
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:32,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how about something that is a little bit more on the mature level, even if it's not M-rated?

570
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:41,646
[SPEAKER_09]: My single favorite Castlevania game ever, Dracula X Rondo of Blood, is coming to Virtual Console!

571
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:43,427
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about damn time!

572
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:45,548
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, guess where?

573
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:47,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Australia.

574
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:49,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Hence my comment before the show.

575
00:40:51,213 --> 00:41:19,644
[SPEAKER_09]: which only they heard if you're live tonight but that's alright which is very interesting because Australia has been getting a lot of bad news lately as far as video games go so this is kind of interesting the OLFC actually has a rating up for as it's titled Castlevania Rondo of Blood for virtual console release I hope that we get it over here but I don't know

576
00:41:21,537 --> 00:41:22,437
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a fun game.

577
00:41:22,477 --> 00:41:29,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I hate having to break out the PC Engine every time I want to play it or try to find the PSP version.

578
00:41:30,082 --> 00:41:32,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I still prefer the PC Engine version over the PSP.

579
00:41:32,844 --> 00:41:37,727
[SPEAKER_02]: If this game were to come out on Virtual Console, wouldn't it be the first PC Engine CD game to do so?

580
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:40,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't we get Ys?

581
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:41,729
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

582
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:46,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I've got Ys Book 1 and 2 on CD.

583
00:41:46,812 --> 00:41:47,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

584
00:41:47,232 --> 00:41:47,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Valus...

585
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

586
00:41:49,454 --> 00:41:50,956
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many games on Virtual Console now.

587
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:51,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to look at the list.

588
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:53,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Ys has been revived on the DS.

589
00:41:54,101 --> 00:41:54,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

590
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:59,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know there's been some newer games there, or PSP, but I don't think the originals ever came to Virtual Console.

591
00:41:59,648 --> 00:42:00,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong.

592
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:01,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in chat might correct us.

593
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:01,931
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to check.

594
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:03,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the originals ever did.

595
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:05,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, chatters, do our dirty work for us.

596
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Go check.

597
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,498
[SPEAKER_02]: If Konami still loves us Why Australia first?

598
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it could just be that maybe that's where the news is leaked.

599
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's really planned for everywhere, but the news has just happened to leak for Australia.

600
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:34,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

601
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:39,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they had to put in their request for rating some earlier date.

602
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:43,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and these ratings requests are how game announcements leak all the freaking time.

603
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:53,607
[SPEAKER_02]: They've tried to take measures to stop that here with the ESRB and the States, but that doesn't change Australia, Europe, and some of the other countries where we get our titles spoiled from.

604
00:42:55,927 --> 00:42:57,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, I'll have that in an instant.

605
00:42:58,038 --> 00:42:59,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I will actually check that out too.

606
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Be finally a way I can actually play this game because I didn't collect all these systems that DarkSakura did.

607
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:06,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you to come over and play it.

608
00:43:06,863 --> 00:43:08,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it would be nice to have it in my own house.

609
00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:12,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not that I don't enjoy spending time with DarkSakura, but it would be nice to fire it up whenever I want.

610
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:13,907
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to play at 2 a.m., I don't have to call you.

611
00:43:14,288 --> 00:43:14,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday.

612
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:17,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know yet.

613
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I might actually have that day off work, so I'll let you know.

614
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:20,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Super.

615
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:21,792
[SPEAKER_08]: The end.

616
00:43:22,653 --> 00:43:22,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

617
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:30,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So Namco, they've got a lot of great games out there and some of those you may have missed.

618
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:32,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And some crappy ones too, just for the record.

619
00:43:33,004 --> 00:43:36,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Some crappy ones you may have missed and may not want to play.

620
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:37,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you really miss them if they're crappy?

621
00:43:38,897 --> 00:43:42,359
[SPEAKER_02]: You may just want to collect the achievements and or trophies.

622
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:02,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful Katamari, sometime in the first quarter of 2010.

623
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:07,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the PlayStation Portable, me and my Katamari on December 22nd.

624
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:10,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's already out there if you want to snag that.

625
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:21,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you know, that being said, they're also planning on putting out other PlayStation 1 and PSP catalog titles as well on the PlayStation Network.

626
00:44:21,854 --> 00:44:21,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

627
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:30,533
[SPEAKER_03]: There also may be other titles coming to the Xbox 360 as well, but they haven't really named names yet.

628
00:44:32,094 --> 00:44:32,895
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat, though.

629
00:44:33,075 --> 00:44:33,855
[SPEAKER_03]: More Katamari.

630
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:38,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that was the worst Katamari game in the series.

631
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:40,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those ones you named were the low points of the series.

632
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I did not enjoy Beautiful Katamari.

633
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:48,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends that say I'm totally not being fair to that game and so forth.

634
00:44:50,191 --> 00:45:00,696
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe they think there's a grudge because of the history our show has with that particular title but no, I think really you put that side by side with Katamari Forever on the PS3 and it is staying no contest.

635
00:45:00,716 --> 00:45:01,596
[SPEAKER_02]: The PS3 one's better.

636
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:06,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the PS3 one is a rehash of some of the old stuff, I still say the PS3 one's better.

637
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:17,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And just wait for the PS3 one to drop down in price because it will pretty quick because it'll kind of fade off pretty fast and you probably will be able to pick up the new Katamari game um

638
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:28,112
[SPEAKER_03]: for $20 or something, and that's about what you're going to pay for these re-releases, so just be patient.

639
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:33,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting how digital distribution is kind of best known for this year.

640
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:38,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Breathing new life into games that had slipped off the radar, which is exactly what Namco is doing here.

641
00:45:38,908 --> 00:45:48,396
[SPEAKER_02]: But I compare this to, you know how Steam is doing their epic sale right now, where, I swear, they undercut this shit down to cost just to get people in the door.

642
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:50,297
[SPEAKER_02]: They might even be taking losses on it.

643
00:45:50,337 --> 00:45:55,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they're doing, but they're just trying to get as many Steam subscribers as they can.

644
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:57,362
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, some of the games they're selling...

645
00:45:58,183 --> 00:46:00,644
[SPEAKER_02]: would have fallen off the radar a long time ago.

646
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:10,090
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, I think they were selling the LucasArts pack for like three bucks, which was the Indiana Jones games and Loom and all that was on sale for three bucks the other day.

647
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:22,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, yeah, that might be a steal, but at the same time for the publisher and all the salespeople involved, that's three bucks they probably weren't going to get because these games are so freaking old.

648
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:23,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Who buys them anymore?

649
00:46:24,538 --> 00:46:26,559
[SPEAKER_02]: But digital distribution kind of opens it all up.

650
00:46:27,557 --> 00:46:28,198
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX Live Marketplace

651
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero World Tour, Band Hero, Lips, Lips No.

652
00:46:55,761 --> 00:46:59,223
[SPEAKER_02]: 1 Hits, Lego Rock Band, Beatles Rock Band, whatever rock band there is.

653
00:47:00,044 --> 00:47:05,627
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have these special front-end stores where you can actually sample music tracks and download the songs.

654
00:47:05,647 --> 00:47:07,669
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be thinking, well, I can already do that in the game.

655
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:17,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can, but now you can also do it through the Xbox 360 interface, which is kind of cool that you don't have to go find the disc to put it in the drive to sample the latest releases.

656
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:18,515
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

657
00:47:38,328 --> 00:47:49,292
[SPEAKER_09]: If you remember from E3, though, a couple years ago, they said that that was one of the things that they wanted to do to begin with was offer the multimedia interaction with the games.

658
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:51,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

659
00:47:53,854 --> 00:48:05,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I have not checked out that storefront myself, but I'm looking at some of the screenshots, and it definitely seems... It's nice that every game kind of gets its own little look and logo and so forth, but where's Rock Revolution?

660
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:07,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

661
00:48:08,234 --> 00:48:08,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

662
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:11,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the dedicated store?

663
00:48:11,218 --> 00:48:12,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, in the clearance bin.

664
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,081
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it is.

665
00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:13,081
$4.99.

666
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Xbox Live should have its own little clearance bin of sorts.

667
00:48:19,565 --> 00:48:20,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's our dumpster.

668
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:21,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, clearance bin.

669
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:23,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of looks like Borderlands.

670
00:48:23,406 --> 00:48:24,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like just this wasteland.

671
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:26,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a great idea for Microsoft.

672
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:26,487
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

673
00:48:26,507 --> 00:48:36,470
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do something similar to that with Project Natal, where you actually dig through the clearance bin with your hands, making different gestures using the Natal camera.

674
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can find the Rock Revolution in there for $4.99.

675
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:40,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

676
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:43,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no one would ever get it.

677
00:48:45,612 --> 00:48:48,213
[SPEAKER_09]: So how about some news about a game no one cares about?

678
00:48:49,228 --> 00:48:49,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Champions Online!

679
00:48:53,926 --> 00:49:02,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, there is going to be a new update and an iPhone app and a recruitment initiative.

680
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:05,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Please play our game.

681
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:07,136
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, right?

682
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:18,846
[SPEAKER_09]: There is Champion's Companion for the iPhone, which you can use to review your character and see your online status, check your friends list, your mail, read news.

683
00:49:18,946 --> 00:49:19,327
[SPEAKER_09]: It's free.

684
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:20,808
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

685
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:42,250
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess that's kind of okay.

686
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:52,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they did an Attack of the Misfit Toys event over the weekend with new costume pieces, action figures, perks, that type of stuff.

687
00:49:52,962 --> 00:49:54,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Please come play our game.

688
00:49:54,383 --> 00:49:55,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, right?

689
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:56,506
[SPEAKER_12]: We need people.

690
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:03,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we had a story just like this a couple weeks ago, but it was Age of Conan.

691
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:04,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar type of thing.

692
00:50:05,037 --> 00:50:07,862
[SPEAKER_02]: They're practically giving the game away to get people to play it.

693
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:10,906
[SPEAKER_09]: They already know where it's going to come in, and that's going to be with Star Trek.

694
00:50:11,347 --> 00:50:11,467
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

695
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:15,140
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm holding out for.

696
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically enough, isn't that what got a lot of people to sign up for Champions Online in the first place?

697
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:22,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Was guaranteed access to Star Trek Online's beta or something like that?

698
00:50:22,724 --> 00:50:27,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember if you got an Uber subscription to Champions, you could play Star Trek Online early or something.

699
00:50:28,486 --> 00:50:30,087
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, that wins the whatever award.

700
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,528
[SPEAKER_02]: That should have been a warning sign right there.

701
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:34,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm already getting a beta, so...

702
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:39,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Our chatroom's actually lighting up with comments on the last story because we're a little bit behind.

703
00:50:39,154 --> 00:50:43,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes time for what we say to encode and you guys to hear it through the All Games feed and so forth.

704
00:50:43,057 --> 00:50:46,960
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still talking about Rock Revolution a little bit because I was giving a little shit in chat earlier.

705
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma in chat says, Sorry, Rock Revolution was well worth the $5 I paid for it.

706
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:56,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad from PodCulture asks, What sucked more, Rock Revolution or Yaris?

707
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:59,150
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, Yaris probably sucked more.

708
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yaris, but for your suck-to-money value...

709
00:51:05,137 --> 00:51:05,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yaris is free.

710
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that difficult to make a successful music game, Konami.

711
00:51:39,102 --> 00:51:40,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've done it in the past.

712
00:51:40,602 --> 00:51:42,163
[SPEAKER_03]: You just kind of have to copy what you did.

713
00:51:42,243 --> 00:51:43,703
[SPEAKER_03]: But somehow you just fuck it up.

714
00:51:44,324 --> 00:51:45,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how you do that.

715
00:51:45,704 --> 00:51:48,265
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, ah, they won't get it over in America.

716
00:51:48,345 --> 00:51:50,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make it all ghetto looking.

717
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:51,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's awesome.

718
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:54,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to shit on your fans.

719
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:57,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And trust me, we're not into that over here.

720
00:51:58,209 --> 00:51:58,989
[SPEAKER_03]: That's other countries.

721
00:51:59,810 --> 00:51:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

722
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:03,975
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to travel around the world and look at some release dates.

723
00:52:04,035 --> 00:52:05,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully some good things coming out soon.

724
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:09,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, then again, it's that time of year where probably there ain't shit coming out.

725
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:10,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Loki.

726
00:52:10,082 --> 00:52:10,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the story here?

727
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:12,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure that's correct.

728
00:52:12,914 --> 00:52:14,274
[SPEAKER_03]: There is nothing coming out.

729
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:18,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And at least last I checked, there was nothing coming out.

730
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:21,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there is anything coming out this week, it's probably crap.

731
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:27,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I guess if you count Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, the Crystal Bears came out today.

732
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:30,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something, I guess.

733
00:52:31,621 --> 00:52:37,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And supposedly this week, Divinity 2 Ego Draconis is supposed to be coming out on PC and Xbox 360.

734
00:52:37,743 --> 00:52:40,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was supposed to be next week, but hey.

735
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:43,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Dreamer, Zookeeper, World Party Games

736
00:53:08,698 --> 00:53:10,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it's the same story in Japan.

737
00:53:10,279 --> 00:53:11,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally not a damn thing coming out.

738
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,641
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very quiet over there right now.

739
00:53:14,282 --> 00:53:19,125
[SPEAKER_02]: A price reduction on Tactics A2 on the DS is about all you got going for you.

740
00:53:20,385 --> 00:53:25,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, there's really not a lot to look forward to until January 9th when Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep hits the Sony PSP.

741
00:53:25,949 --> 00:53:27,970
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the next big, big release over in Japan.

742
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:31,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't find a damn thing for Europe.

743
00:53:31,192 --> 00:53:31,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

744
00:53:32,423 --> 00:53:34,945
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that time of year, folks, but we talk about them every week.

745
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:39,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a good week to go back and play the games you missed this year in 2009, yes?

746
00:53:39,408 --> 00:53:39,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

747
00:53:40,129 --> 00:53:40,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

748
00:53:40,689 --> 00:53:41,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

749
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,410
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so back to some news then.

750
00:53:42,611 --> 00:53:42,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

751
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:55,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So soon, and I'm not sure if this is actually going to happen because I could think a lot of other people would be pissed off for other reasons, but pretty soon you may not be able to play your PSP or DS on airplanes.

752
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:59,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently somebody is trying to...

753
00:54:01,124 --> 00:54:02,086
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

754
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:19,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, there is a guy, Omar... I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name.

755
00:54:19,706 --> 00:54:26,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, the guy was arrested after failing to ignite an explosive device on Christmas Day on a plane.

756
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:28,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, I heard about that on CNN.

757
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:29,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So that had to do with electronic devices?

758
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:30,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

759
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:33,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently... Let's see...

760
00:54:34,652 --> 00:54:36,832
[SPEAKER_02]: One motherfucker always ruins it for everybody else.

761
00:54:37,813 --> 00:54:44,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how you can't take in water over a certain size, and your shampoo has to be in a clear bottle and in a plastic bag?

762
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:45,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not mad.

763
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:57,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that they're doing it for our safety and what have you, but it's because some asshole threatened to use it as a bomb and said that you could use water as a... It's just frustrating.

764
00:54:57,757 --> 00:54:58,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, yeah, he...

765
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:01,864
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

766
00:55:20,716 --> 00:55:31,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Full-bag searches were instigated at the boarding gates, and the ban on electronic devices is said to be a reaction to his ability to smuggle an explosive onto the plane.

767
00:55:32,019 --> 00:55:41,642
[SPEAKER_03]: This would, of course, mean any DS or PSP would be banned, as well as anything from...

768
00:55:42,362 --> 00:55:46,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Electronic Books, iPods, cell phones, other gaming devices, etc.

769
00:55:46,147 --> 00:55:48,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make flight so incredibly boring.

770
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:49,692
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to fly.

771
00:55:49,712 --> 00:55:50,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Pun intended.

772
00:55:52,950 --> 00:56:02,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, honestly, I'm surprised he was able to do that, because, I mean, they scan all that stuff through, you know... Well, he was on an international flight.

773
00:56:02,754 --> 00:56:03,974
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't get screened at a U.S.

774
00:56:04,014 --> 00:56:04,394
[SPEAKER_02]: airport.

775
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:05,895
[SPEAKER_02]: He got screened at a Dutch airport.

776
00:56:06,035 --> 00:56:11,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to... I don't know what they do over there that's different than what they do over here, but he didn't get in the U.S.

777
00:56:11,257 --> 00:56:12,077
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a bomb.

778
00:56:12,337 --> 00:56:12,497
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

779
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:13,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you may go.

780
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:16,659
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

781
00:56:18,424 --> 00:56:21,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't see them banning all electronics on planes.

782
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:22,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a bit much.

783
00:56:23,065 --> 00:56:32,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to suck because I know a lot of airlines are looking into, like, I think Virgin Air, one of them, if they're not already doing it, was looking into, like, free Wi-Fi on flights now.

784
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:37,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's what the technology's gotten, is you can get on the internet on flights, which is pretty amazing.

785
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would really suck to kind of rip that all away.

786
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,011
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, if there is a true...

787
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:47,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Threat, I suppose, for lack of a better term, to, you know, electronic devices on planes.

788
00:56:47,935 --> 00:56:51,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that they can't screen for at the airport for God knows whatever reason.

789
00:56:51,098 --> 00:56:51,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something.

790
00:56:51,978 --> 00:56:52,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Safety first.

791
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:56,402
[SPEAKER_02]: People didn't have laptops 20 years ago, 30 years ago.

792
00:56:56,842 --> 00:56:58,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Flights will still work, you know.

793
00:56:58,423 --> 00:57:03,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what if some dude was to create an EMP bomb using electronic devices?

794
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:07,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't detect that because it's not an explosive.

795
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The plane would go down.

796
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:09,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

797
00:57:09,372 --> 00:57:09,972
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the point.

798
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:11,874
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to explode or, you know.

799
00:57:13,424 --> 00:57:15,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's probably thought of that.

800
00:57:15,425 --> 00:57:16,485
[SPEAKER_02]: They have something.

801
00:57:16,865 --> 00:57:19,046
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't advertise all their countermeasures.

802
00:57:19,286 --> 00:57:20,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for obvious reasons.

803
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:30,170
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, if anyone was going to actually be able to project an EMP that would make a plane go down, it'd be a bigger device.

804
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,471
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't be something that could be hidden that easily.

805
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:34,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

806
00:57:34,432 --> 00:57:36,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just playing devil's advocate.

807
00:57:36,612 --> 00:57:37,193
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.

808
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:40,794
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just... Although that really would be about the only thing I could think of.

809
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:46,690
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt wants to add, Rob, he hid firecrackers in his crotch.

810
00:57:47,191 --> 00:57:51,214
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dutch screeners scanned him, but they wouldn't have found them unless they patted him down.

811
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,616
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems so odd to me.

812
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,559
[SPEAKER_09]: How many did he have in his crotch?

813
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was one of those things where it only takes a spark to ignite...

814
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:18,074
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have something flammable I don't know Obviously they're not telling you the details On what he was planning to do for obvious reasons But I still find it shocking That he was able to hide firecrackers Undetected You know It sucks

815
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:22,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Electronic Gaming Monthly is coming back!

816
00:58:44,628 --> 00:58:50,871
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be coming back with an April issue that's released in March because, you know, they come out a month before the actual date on the magazine.

817
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:52,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when it's coming out.

818
00:58:54,393 --> 00:58:57,354
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a press release that came out that announced that it will be coming out.

819
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:01,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also going to be an EGMI, the digital magazine.

820
00:59:01,776 --> 00:59:10,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's a special code that will be in the issue that allows you to access the digital components for exclusive article extensions and original content.

821
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to get you to buy the, you know, trying to tie it into the Internet.

822
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:14,743
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

823
00:59:41,058 --> 00:59:42,379
[SPEAKER_02]: A little silly, but I don't know.

824
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:44,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Features and things, I suppose.

825
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:55,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone that doesn't have a subscription to Gameformer, and pretty much if you shop at GameStop and you have one of their cards, you have a subscription because you get it for free when you get their stupid card.

826
00:59:56,112 --> 00:59:59,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, the online portion of it is kind of useless.

827
01:00:00,036 --> 01:00:04,540
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some additional screenshots, usually, or some...

828
01:00:06,391 --> 01:00:08,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss the old magazines with demo discs.

829
01:00:27,386 --> 01:00:27,927
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

830
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:44,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, occasionally, though, they did have some free download content in there, which is kind of cool.

831
01:00:44,405 --> 01:00:46,887
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a few Oblivion expansions and stuff like that were free.

832
01:00:47,247 --> 01:00:48,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

833
01:00:48,108 --> 01:00:49,069
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little bit of a value.

834
01:00:49,129 --> 01:00:53,752
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm kind of missing the days, like, well, you know, I used to buy PC Gamer, too.

835
01:00:53,812 --> 01:00:56,154
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to have a whole bunch of shareware and free shit on there.

836
01:00:56,274 --> 01:01:01,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wouldn't it now just be type in the code and get a demo on PSN or Xbox Live?

837
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:02,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they could do that.

838
01:01:02,479 --> 01:01:04,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, why bother with the cost of discs now?

839
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:05,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all digital.

840
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:05,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

841
01:01:05,782 --> 01:01:06,783
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

842
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:49,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to pick up your bathroom reader of Electronic Gaming Monthly, it will feature stuff by Dan, Shu, Sue, Sean Baby is part of the crew as well, and so on and so on.

843
01:01:49,704 --> 01:01:51,604
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of names you probably recognize from previous years.

844
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he did the comic, the Sue and Sean comic.

845
01:01:54,365 --> 01:01:56,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to read those like all the time.

846
01:01:57,426 --> 01:01:59,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had a webcomic I think for a little while too.

847
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want to check that out, it will be coming out soon, so check out the newsstands.

848
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:06,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's some other stuff you can spend your money on.

849
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:07,411
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

850
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:09,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Sackboy plushies.

851
01:02:10,413 --> 01:02:12,514
[SPEAKER_09]: They are now on Amazon.

852
01:02:13,094 --> 01:02:16,677
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get a Sackboy and a Sackgirl for $20.

853
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:17,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

854
01:02:20,399 --> 01:02:22,060
[SPEAKER_09]: But they won't have any until December 30th.

855
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:22,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

856
01:02:25,322 --> 01:02:27,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like the look of the Sackgirl on there.

857
01:02:27,484 --> 01:02:29,445
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the Sackgirl looks stupid, but the Sackboy's pretty cute.

858
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:32,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Sackboy is adorable.

859
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:51,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Team Fortress 2, if you don't have enough friends to play the game with you, Valve has the answer for you.

860
01:02:51,747 --> 01:02:54,149
[SPEAKER_03]: They are beta testing right now AI opponents.

861
01:02:54,369 --> 01:03:04,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you will be able to use some pretty intelligent bots as your opponents to fill in gaps that you may have on your team.

862
01:03:04,978 --> 01:03:08,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, I believe this is available now.

863
01:03:08,681 --> 01:03:10,523
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have some...

864
01:03:11,924 --> 01:03:19,691
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff you use in the console, including ways to add people to there or remove AI players and whatnot.

865
01:03:20,892 --> 01:03:28,259
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently they're pretty cool, and they actually, I don't know, are good replacements for people that may not be there.

866
01:03:28,819 --> 01:03:35,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they've done this in Counter-Strike and stuff like that, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do it here.

867
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:40,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing ranked games, you know, now, almost every day.

868
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:07,170
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

869
01:04:25,882 --> 01:04:29,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to join our game because... You want to give out your gamer tag?

870
01:04:29,184 --> 01:04:30,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, LokiOLR.

871
01:04:32,626 --> 01:04:33,226
[SPEAKER_03]: All one word.

872
01:04:33,346 --> 01:04:36,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's... Just feel free.

873
01:04:36,528 --> 01:04:38,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really be invited into the game.

874
01:04:38,649 --> 01:04:40,310
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to kind of join a ranked game.

875
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:42,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And trust me, there's hardly anyone playing right now.

876
01:04:42,191 --> 01:04:44,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really easy to join the game.

877
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:50,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can just see if I'm online, most likely playing Grand Theft Auto, join the game, and prepare to get your ass kicked.

878
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:53,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, it's so modest

879
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:23,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, by the way, they've come out and said, of course, deny, deny, deny.

880
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:31,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It's come out apparently that the Sony PSP-4000 mention was a mistake on their part.

881
01:05:32,147 --> 01:05:35,668
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no new model of the PSP under construction.

882
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh, sure, whatever you say, dude.

883
01:05:38,569 --> 01:05:39,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, just like they...

884
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:54,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't have an icon or whatever like that that was also available on Sony's website as well that someone found by changing the file name or whatever of like the PSP 3000 icon on there to the 4000.

885
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:55,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look, it shows up.

886
01:05:56,862 --> 01:06:00,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you know, Sony came out and said, oh, yeah, this is not true.

887
01:06:00,364 --> 01:06:02,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the company that put out the ad said, oh, yeah, this is not true.

888
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:04,166
[SPEAKER_03]: But come on.

889
01:06:04,662 --> 01:06:10,145
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were really going to put it out and this company leaked it out, wouldn't they be telling the company, deny everything?

890
01:06:10,225 --> 01:06:10,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

891
01:06:10,606 --> 01:06:13,027
[SPEAKER_02]: The response coming here is, I don't know.

892
01:06:13,107 --> 01:06:15,849
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what you're talking about.

893
01:06:16,569 --> 01:06:18,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy people.

894
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:18,490
$4,000.

895
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:20,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether they do or not, let me put it this way.

896
01:06:20,892 --> 01:06:22,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be significant either way.

897
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:25,635
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Sony.

898
01:06:25,755 --> 01:06:27,456
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not coming out with a $4,000.

899
01:06:27,956 --> 01:06:30,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I will pretend to be surprised when you announce the $4,000.

900
01:06:31,718 --> 01:06:32,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like with the Go.

901
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:37,213
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not doing a UMD List PSP with a sliding screen.

902
01:06:37,233 --> 01:06:38,453
[SPEAKER_03]: That's preposterous.

903
01:06:39,974 --> 01:06:41,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, the PSP Go is coming out now.

904
01:06:42,175 --> 01:06:42,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Here comes E3.

905
01:06:43,155 --> 01:06:43,976
[SPEAKER_03]: LOL, gotcha.

906
01:06:46,157 --> 01:06:46,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, 4,000.

907
01:06:46,797 --> 01:06:48,118
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't see that one coming.

908
01:06:48,598 --> 01:06:48,858
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

909
01:06:49,997 --> 01:07:16,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should name it the 4001 just to spite everybody Sony, if you're listening, seriously that is how you could get the last laugh because we all know you're doing it now just suck it up name it the PSP 4001 and lol alright, we're going to take some time here on the show to respect the classics it is time for the very last classic game of the week of the decade

910
01:07:18,328 --> 01:07:20,850
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this segment will be back in 2010, of course it will.

911
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:33,020
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a chance for DarkSakura to dig through the gaming archives and pick a game from Gaming's Yesteryear that she says, Damn it, you ungrateful kids these days and your newfangled 360s and PS3s.

912
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:37,284
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to go play the games we used to play back in my day.

913
01:07:37,744 --> 01:07:39,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she'll run over you with her walker, right?

914
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:40,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I went, no.

915
01:07:41,487 --> 01:07:43,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I went for Epic Old School Awesome.

916
01:07:43,529 --> 01:07:46,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so what is the Epic Old School Awesome video game of the week?

917
01:07:46,448 --> 01:07:48,809
[SPEAKER_09]: The video game of the week is Salamander.

918
01:07:50,629 --> 01:07:52,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure I haven't done Salamander yet.

919
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:53,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you have either.

920
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:54,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a shame.

921
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then here is a little clip of Salamander.

922
01:07:56,912 --> 01:07:57,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's listen to the intro.

923
01:08:12,847 --> 01:08:14,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Now what is this Dark Sakura?

924
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,508
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just Life Force, right?

925
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:17,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, yes.

926
01:08:18,808 --> 01:08:21,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Life Force is the name it came out with in North America.

927
01:08:22,289 --> 01:08:26,430
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's a spin-off from the Gradius series.

928
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:34,211
[SPEAKER_09]: And it actually switches between horizontal and vertically scrolling areas.

929
01:08:34,932 --> 01:08:36,512
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got kind of a little bit of both.

930
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:40,813
[SPEAKER_09]: It also has a more simplified power-up system, too.

931
01:08:41,653 --> 01:08:43,998
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can play two player co-op which is great.

932
01:08:44,459 --> 01:08:46,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's in all of the stages by the way.

933
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:54,276
[SPEAKER_09]: So, player one is the Vic Viper, and player two is the Lord British.

934
01:08:54,977 --> 01:08:57,159
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, did you know there's a Salamander anime?

935
01:08:57,339 --> 01:08:59,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, they really called one of the ships the Lord British?

936
01:08:59,681 --> 01:08:59,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

937
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:02,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the same guy who did Ultima Lord British?

938
01:09:03,124 --> 01:09:04,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

939
01:09:05,886 --> 01:09:08,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because when I hear Lord British, I think of the dude who did Ultima back in the day.

940
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:14,134
[SPEAKER_09]: At any rate, well, you've got the Vic Viper and Lord British.

941
01:09:15,536 --> 01:09:20,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And you play through six stages, and like I said, it alternates between horizontal and vertical.

942
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:30,226
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually continue from where you left off upon death, instead of the checkpoint version that Gradius has.

943
01:09:30,786 --> 01:09:37,771
[SPEAKER_09]: You do not have any continues in salamander mode when you play single, but you have two continues in two-player mode.

944
01:09:38,371 --> 01:09:38,892
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com

945
01:10:01,058 --> 01:10:10,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, whoever's doing this playthrough here off this YouTube, it's user Succula, S-U-C-C-U-L-L-A is the YouTube we're looking at here in studio right now where the music's coming from.

946
01:10:11,224 --> 01:10:11,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic.

947
01:10:12,264 --> 01:10:14,245
[SPEAKER_02]: This person knows what the fuck they're doing with this game.

948
01:10:14,285 --> 01:10:15,686
[SPEAKER_02]: They know where it's at.

949
01:10:15,866 --> 01:10:28,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, on top of that, just like any of the Gradius games, especially with the bosses, there are little hidey places that you can go to and ways to lure the boss or whatever to where you need it to be.

950
01:10:28,894 --> 01:10:34,536
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I'm right, I think this is a one playthrough beating of this game, which is really freaking difficult.

951
01:10:34,616 --> 01:10:35,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the laser.

952
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:36,477
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my favorite weapon.

953
01:10:37,757 --> 01:10:39,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I just freaking love Lifeforce on the NES.

954
01:10:39,638 --> 01:10:43,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I realize, you know, it has its roots different places, but I remember it as Lifeforce on the NES.

955
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:44,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got it.

956
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, if you want to play it.

957
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I know.

958
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember seeing it in the vault.

959
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:56,103
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just kind of, you know, I like the voice in this one, but I miss the double, you know,

960
01:10:57,417 --> 01:10:57,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Option!

961
01:10:58,058 --> 01:10:58,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And all that.

962
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:00,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Speed Up.

963
01:11:00,744 --> 01:11:01,446
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, but anyway.

964
01:11:02,468 --> 01:11:04,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so you've got different backgrounds.

965
01:11:04,152 --> 01:11:05,576
[SPEAKER_09]: You have Starfields.

966
01:11:05,976 --> 01:11:07,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you've got, uh...

967
01:11:09,062 --> 01:11:09,942
[SPEAKER_09]: All kinds of different stuff.

968
01:11:09,962 --> 01:11:18,745
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually some big differences between the Japanese version and the European version and Lifeforce.

969
01:11:19,765 --> 01:11:37,411
[SPEAKER_09]: The Japanese and European versions are pretty much the same except the American version changes the plot to the game by having some opening text where you're actually going inside a giant alien lifeform to fight off bacteria.

970
01:11:38,214 --> 01:11:45,857
[SPEAKER_09]: and so the star fields from Salamander were actually changed to kind of a web background so that it looks more organic.

971
01:11:46,617 --> 01:11:47,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure you remember that, Rob, don't you?

972
01:11:48,298 --> 01:11:48,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

973
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:50,518
[SPEAKER_09]: The power-ups have different names.

974
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:58,181
[SPEAKER_09]: You have Speed Up becoming Hyper Speed, Missile becoming Destruct Missile, the Ripple Laser becoming Pulse Laser, and Force Field becoming Shield.

975
01:11:58,621 --> 01:12:00,222
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG, I love the fire level.

976
01:12:01,027 --> 01:12:01,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

977
01:12:01,847 --> 01:12:04,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, they're in Stage 3 right now on their epic playthrough.

978
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the fire.

979
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:06,270
[SPEAKER_09]: There should be a link to Level 4.

980
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,771
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, Level 4, Rob, I wish you would place at the beginning of that.

981
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:10,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be the Saturn.

982
01:12:10,712 --> 01:12:11,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you want to skip ahead a little bit here?

983
01:12:12,013 --> 01:12:12,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to the fourth one.

984
01:12:13,013 --> 01:12:16,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but this music you'll recognize from B-Mania.

985
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:17,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

986
01:12:19,924 --> 01:12:28,827
[SPEAKER_09]: That music right there was the beginning of the Accelerator B crush mix.

987
01:12:29,447 --> 01:12:30,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

988
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:37,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, stage 4 has my favorite music in the game.

989
01:12:38,089 --> 01:12:48,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other differences, your power-ups were modified a little bit to where for a

990
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:53,288
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the same for Life Force, the Japanese Life Force.

991
01:12:53,408 --> 01:12:55,789
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually had the same power-up as Gradius.

992
01:12:56,309 --> 01:12:57,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Some music was changed.

993
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:09,155
[SPEAKER_09]: You can, however, get the original Japanese version and the Enhanced Life Force with the Salamander Deluxe Pack that came out for PlayStation and Saturn, and Salamander Portable on PSP.

994
01:13:09,815 --> 01:13:15,158
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, we have the NES version, which actually came out in 87...

995
01:13:19,207 --> 01:13:27,810
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually, though, just took bits from Salamander and Life Force to kind of make it a bit of a new concept in the game.

996
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:39,254
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually, we got the port for the NES, and it's exactly the same, except it doesn't have multiple endings like the Japanese one does, and it's just called Life Force.

997
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:45,816
[SPEAKER_09]: All of these use the Konami code, and the NES version is out on the virtual console.

998
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:47,596
[SPEAKER_09]: 500 Wii Points.

999
01:13:47,616 --> 01:13:48,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get it.

1000
01:13:48,576 --> 01:13:51,377
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an MSX version that's pretty different.

1001
01:13:52,757 --> 01:14:04,920
[SPEAKER_09]: You have different pilots for each of the ships, which if I do remember correctly, I think that it was from the MSX version that the anime was based off of.

1002
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:06,521
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long time since I've watched the anime.

1003
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:07,561
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got it on DVD somewhere.

1004
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:09,903
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a PC Engine version.

1005
01:14:11,284 --> 01:14:15,527
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually have checkpoints in this one, faster enemy animations.

1006
01:14:17,128 --> 01:14:19,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, they improved some of the music from the arcade version.

1007
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:25,976
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Ocean Software brought it out for the Spectrum Commodore and Amstrad in 1988.

1008
01:14:26,396 --> 01:14:33,302
[SPEAKER_09]: But the Commodore 64 version, Rob, you may be particularly happy to find out, was pretty much...

1009
01:14:34,562 --> 01:14:37,103
[SPEAKER_09]: considered one of the best of the PC ports.

1010
01:14:37,763 --> 01:14:39,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1011
01:14:39,283 --> 01:14:41,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, like I said, it came out on the PlayStation and Saturn.

1012
01:14:42,564 --> 01:14:46,905
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the Salamander Deluxe Pack, and also included with that was Salamander 2.

1013
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:49,705
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was Salamander Life Force and Salamander 2.

1014
01:14:51,506 --> 01:15:00,508
[SPEAKER_09]: PSP, we got Salamander Portable, which had actually a few other kind of rare games in it.

1015
01:15:00,588 --> 01:15:01,028
[SPEAKER_09]: It had...

1016
01:15:02,825 --> 01:15:21,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Salamander, Life Force, Salamander 2, Zexix, I think that's what it's called, Zexix, X-E-X-E-X, that's a game I haven't played in a long time, and the MSX version of Gradius 2, which came out, I think, as Nemesis 2, which has nothing to do with the arcade Gradius 2.

1017
01:15:23,604 --> 01:15:25,826
[SPEAKER_09]: and for the record, Gradius 2 on PC Engine.

1018
01:15:26,186 --> 01:15:26,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

1019
01:15:26,987 --> 01:15:27,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1020
01:15:27,867 --> 01:15:30,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, here's actually the thing about the anime in here.

1021
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:35,113
[SPEAKER_09]: There was an OAV and it had to do with...

1022
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:38,572
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1023
01:15:58,447 --> 01:16:00,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's also a couple good soundtracks too.

1024
01:16:00,608 --> 01:16:12,432
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the Salamander Arcade soundtrack, there is the original Sound of Salamander, and Salamander again, Konami Kukeiha Club, which, you know, they did a few games from that series.

1025
01:16:12,832 --> 01:16:14,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, a few soundtracks from that series.

1026
01:16:14,793 --> 01:16:15,233
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1027
01:16:16,074 --> 01:16:16,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Yummy.

1028
01:16:18,114 --> 01:16:20,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of Salamander-y things.

1029
01:16:20,515 --> 01:16:23,736
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, I freaking love the cover of the soundtrack.

1030
01:16:24,677 --> 01:16:26,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look at that and tell me that's not awesome.

1031
01:16:26,878 --> 01:16:27,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna link it in chatroom.

1032
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:30,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's like a big demon face thing.

1033
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:32,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of scary, actually, a little bit.

1034
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:33,422
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like an evil snake.

1035
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:34,223
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1036
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Which really has nothing to do with the salamander, I guess.

1037
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than being, you know, reptiles, I guess, maybe?

1038
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:49,657
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, there it is, your classic game of the week, Salamander, which is available on a variety of different systems, but if you want to play the original, go play the arcade version.

1039
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:51,659
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find it if you know where to look.

1040
01:16:52,728 --> 01:16:55,992
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1041
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:56,733
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not done yet.

1042
01:16:56,793 --> 01:16:57,594
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we're going to be back.

1043
01:16:57,634 --> 01:17:07,406
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have some rapid-fire news, your Twitter topics, and then we're going to take a break from the news tonight and talk a little bit about what's happened this year, talk about our picks for Game of the Year.

1044
01:17:07,626 --> 01:17:08,147
[SPEAKER_08]: And donuts.

1045
01:17:08,968 --> 01:17:10,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to talk about donuts?

1046
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want one.

1047
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:12,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a donut too.

1048
01:17:12,904 --> 01:17:14,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want a pony.

1049
01:17:14,605 --> 01:17:15,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a pony, Rob.

1050
01:17:15,926 --> 01:17:16,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I tell you that?

1051
01:17:16,786 --> 01:17:18,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I have to share this.

1052
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:29,833
[SPEAKER_09]: For our team, Builder, we did our annual present exchange and we were given these little pieces of paper that says write down what you want so that whoever gets our name doesn't buy us crap.

1053
01:17:30,633 --> 01:17:34,816
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, okay, I want an Amazon gift card or this gift card or that gift card or a pony.

1054
01:17:35,676 --> 01:17:39,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So someone, the person who got me, got me a toy pony.

1055
01:17:40,182 --> 01:17:40,783
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

1056
01:17:40,863 --> 01:17:42,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a gift card to Barnes & Noble.

1057
01:17:42,905 --> 01:17:43,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1058
01:17:43,305 --> 01:17:44,266
[SPEAKER_09]: But I finally got my pony.

1059
01:17:44,766 --> 01:17:46,548
[SPEAKER_09]: That means I have to stop asking for one at restaurants.

1060
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,391
[SPEAKER_02]: When they say, what can I get you tonight?

1061
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:50,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a pony.

1062
01:17:50,452 --> 01:17:51,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you need anything else?

1063
01:17:51,073 --> 01:17:52,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd like a pony, please.

1064
01:17:54,156 --> 01:17:56,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to stick with either the llama or the pygmy goat.

1065
01:17:57,539 --> 01:17:57,799
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1066
01:17:58,079 --> 01:17:59,300
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a quick break, guys.

1067
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:04,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in the year and the decade in review in just a few minutes.

1068
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:20,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, December the 27th of 2009, where we're taping the 350th episode of our show.

1069
01:18:20,867 --> 01:18:26,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, it's the very last Orange Lounge Radio of the decade, but we'll be back next week as always to do it all again.

1070
01:18:26,892 --> 01:18:35,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Since it is the last OLR of the decade and it's been a little bit of a slow news week, we're going to take some time to reflect on our favorite games of the year and of the decade.

1071
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:42,228
[SPEAKER_02]: But meanwhile, we do have a few other news stories we want to get to real quick in a segment we call the Rapid Fire News.

1072
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:43,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we'll get to your Twitter topics, too.

1073
01:18:43,991 --> 01:18:49,541
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't sent us your tweets yet, hurry up and do that because we're going to get to those very soon, as soon as we get out our Rapid Fire News.

1074
01:18:49,701 --> 01:18:50,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki.

1075
01:18:51,516 --> 01:19:06,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, well, if you're looking for something to do shortly after the new year, you can perhaps join the MAG Beta, which was previously not available to everybody, but starting January 4th will be, and...

1076
01:19:08,218 --> 01:19:11,199
[SPEAKER_03]: You will be able to download it on the PlayStation Network.

1077
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:21,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Existing beta members will be able to update their files to prepare for the upcoming trial, which means that you shouldn't delete any of your magdata if you are already in the beta.

1078
01:19:21,784 --> 01:19:24,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently the beta is pretty short, though.

1079
01:19:24,105 --> 01:19:29,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It is only lasting a week until, well, slightly under a week, until January 10th.

1080
01:19:30,177 --> 01:19:37,942
[SPEAKER_03]: But you will be able to play 64 player sabotage matches and also 256 player domination matches.

1081
01:19:39,903 --> 01:19:40,764
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat.

1082
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:43,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course the end of the game will be coming out shortly after that.

1083
01:19:43,986 --> 01:19:45,527
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 26th?

1084
01:19:47,772 --> 01:20:15,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, also on the PlayStation Network will be coming Holy Invasion of Privacy Badman 2 Um, and what's kind of cool about it as well is that you will not only be able to get the sequel But the first game will be included with it for free Um, and that is of course if you get it via the PlayStation Network No word though if, um, when they decide to put this out as an actual UMD If the original game will appear on there as well

1085
01:20:15,973 --> 01:20:22,998
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least right now, it's kind of a nice bonus for people who may own the PSP Go and that's their only option.

1086
01:20:23,358 --> 01:20:25,040
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat.

1087
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:36,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, in un-Sony PlayStation news, Crackdown 2 is scheduled to be coming out the first half of 2010, which makes me all sorts of happy.

1088
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:55,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And no word exactly yet when it's going to be coming, but apparently it was revealed on Major Nelson's weekly podcast that Xbox's head Aaron Greenberg apparently is saying that Mass Effect 2, Splinter Cell Conviction, and Alan Wake,

1089
01:20:56,458 --> 01:21:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently also CrackedN2 who are scheduled for the first part of the year.

1090
01:21:02,521 --> 01:21:05,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess Alan Wake isn't coming out later in the year like I thought.

1091
01:21:06,303 --> 01:21:08,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably second quarter if I guessed correctly.

1092
01:21:09,488 --> 01:21:11,989
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, some other games coming out before too long.

1093
01:21:12,169 --> 01:21:15,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Resonance of Fate, some folks might be interested in this, is by TriAce.

1094
01:21:16,311 --> 01:21:21,913
[SPEAKER_02]: This is already available as a demo on the Japanese PlayStation Network or the Japanese Xbox 360.

1095
01:21:22,494 --> 01:21:29,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a Japanese PSN account or you have a way of getting onto the – I guess the Xbox is a little better now blocking the non-Japanese stuff.

1096
01:21:29,917 --> 01:21:30,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, not very good at that.

1097
01:21:31,497 --> 01:21:34,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you can do to get in there, you can do that to download that demo.

1098
01:21:34,978 --> 01:21:38,658
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't already heard about this game, it's coming out from Sega's publishing it.

1099
01:21:38,738 --> 01:21:41,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a gunplay style RPG.

1100
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:42,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out.

1101
01:21:42,879 --> 01:21:43,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Resonance of Fate.

1102
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:48,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Now available in Japan or for those of you crafty folks over in other countries who know how to get in anyway.

1103
01:21:50,421 --> 01:21:51,541
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL Eye of Judgment.

1104
01:21:51,861 --> 01:21:56,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's coming out on the PSP, but no camera, no cards, and apparently...

1105
01:21:57,662 --> 01:22:20,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure the UMD is really going to be there either Legends is just going to be on the PlayStation Store It's going to be there in the spring of 2010 It'll have 300 digital cards 30 that are unique on the PSP No UMD release expected at this time It's only going to be a digital download That doesn't mean it's only playable on the go Because remember, if you have a big enough memory card on the 3000 That's all you need Is that included in the bet?

1106
01:22:22,426 --> 01:22:23,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, good question.

1107
01:22:24,129 --> 01:22:31,780
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and the reason why is because it's not as ridiculous as The Eye of Judgment, whereas this, you know, is an actual game that can play like a traditional game.

1108
01:22:32,321 --> 01:22:36,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something that's, you know, a card game with this extra camera crap that's added on top of it.

1109
01:22:37,276 --> 01:22:45,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I will give Loki that, I mean, let's face it, part of what made the first game so preposterous was the fact that, you know, you're playing this card game with a camera, and I think that's why he took the bet in the first place.

1110
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:47,583
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP's deleting all that weird shit out.

1111
01:22:48,123 --> 01:22:59,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's actually a game, it'd be like almost like a translation of a Magic the Gathering game, whereas, you know, I judgment, I can imagine being played without the camera and all the extra crap.

1112
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:04,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough, guys, let's just face it, Loki's never going to lose that bet, at least not in this decade.

1113
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:06,001
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1114
01:23:28,807 --> 01:23:32,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't expect any new weapons or any significant changes to gameplay.

1115
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:40,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, you know, la la la, Winter Wonderland, etc, etc, candy canes and so forth for you to blow your friends away to.

1116
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun with that.

1117
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:43,431
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1118
01:23:44,131 --> 01:23:44,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Some stuff.

1119
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:46,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like and such as?

1120
01:23:47,413 --> 01:23:53,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Sega's having a big sale in their Wii Shop channel.

1121
01:23:54,216 --> 01:23:59,998
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have some of the games like Sonic 1, 2, 3, Gunstar Heroes, Streets of Rage 2, Pio Pio 2.

1122
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:06,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, they're going to be $5 until January 6th.

1123
01:24:07,321 --> 01:24:09,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So each of them are $3 less than usual.

1124
01:24:09,322 --> 01:24:11,303
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think they just want to make some money.

1125
01:24:12,644 --> 01:24:13,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So go buy them.

1126
01:24:15,499 --> 01:24:24,750
[SPEAKER_09]: and as far as other stuff going on, there is a New Year's theme for free on Xbox Live, which it's pretty colorful.

1127
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:26,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan was using it for a little while.

1128
01:24:26,292 --> 01:24:28,154
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a big ball on top of the building.

1129
01:24:28,174 --> 01:24:29,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Also,

1130
01:24:34,073 --> 01:24:43,566
[SPEAKER_09]: They have some other things to go with the new year that you have to pay for them, like the 2010 Avatar glasses.

1131
01:24:44,988 --> 01:24:49,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's also the deal of the day stuff, like I believe it was the other day was Worms 2.

1132
01:24:50,656 --> 01:24:51,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other stuff.

1133
01:24:52,580 --> 01:25:07,513
[SPEAKER_09]: and then last but not least, and actually this is I think the best news of all, is there is a country pack for Rock Band, but who cares about the country crap because there's also a Paul McCartney set in there as well.

1134
01:25:08,294 --> 01:25:10,536
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's actually...

1135
01:25:12,478 --> 01:25:24,107
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually December 29th is the Country Pack, which Alan Jackson's Good Time, Cross Canadian Ragweed, Cry Lonely, Jason Aldean, She's Country, Keith Urban, I Told You So.

1136
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:27,410
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems to be the only good thing in the whole packet.

1137
01:25:28,651 --> 01:25:29,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Kenny Rogers, A Gambler.

1138
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe Kenny Rogers is a classic.

1139
01:25:32,234 --> 01:25:36,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Martina McBride, This One's for the Girls, Shania Twain, Any Man of Mine, blah, blah, blah.

1140
01:25:36,519 --> 01:25:42,023
[SPEAKER_09]: But the Paul McCartney Pack is going to be out on January 5th or January 7th for PS3 owners.

1141
01:25:42,063 --> 01:25:43,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Haha, we'll get it first.

1142
01:25:43,604 --> 01:25:45,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox, Xbox.

1143
01:25:46,005 --> 01:25:50,168
[SPEAKER_09]: For that set you get Band on the Run, the live, actually all these are live versions.

1144
01:25:51,449 --> 01:25:54,571
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from the Paul McCartney New York City concert.

1145
01:25:55,111 --> 01:25:59,333
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's Band on the Run, Jet, and Sing the Changes.

1146
01:25:59,653 --> 01:26:07,917
[SPEAKER_09]: All of those are going to be 160 Xbox points or 200 Wii points each.

1147
01:26:10,518 --> 01:26:15,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And these are actually, there's no telling if they're going to be available for Lego Rock Band.

1148
01:26:17,741 --> 01:26:18,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1149
01:26:20,002 --> 01:26:21,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait until January 5th.

1150
01:26:23,223 --> 01:26:24,483
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll start off the year with a bang.

1151
01:26:24,803 --> 01:26:26,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a few guitar strums, whatever the case may be.

1152
01:26:26,964 --> 01:26:28,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some Twitter topics.

1153
01:26:29,024 --> 01:26:34,986
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been taking some of your submissions over Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR for some things we might have missed so far in the show.

1154
01:26:35,406 --> 01:26:47,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And some random-ass questions, such as this first one from Blue Swim, who tweets us, If you could bring only one celebrity who died during the Oz decade back to life, who would it be and why?

1155
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:55,430
[SPEAKER_02]: He continues on to tweet, I'd bring Heath Ledger back to life so he could reprise his role as the Joker in the new Batman movies again.

1156
01:26:56,951 --> 01:26:58,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, I don't know.

1157
01:26:59,771 --> 01:27:05,212
[SPEAKER_02]: To think all the way back throughout the entire decade of the O's, that's a long time.

1158
01:27:05,252 --> 01:27:06,213
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people die.

1159
01:27:06,573 --> 01:27:07,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Death just kind of happens.

1160
01:27:07,913 --> 01:27:08,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure.

1161
01:27:08,913 --> 01:27:12,034
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could bring back only one celebrity, he specifically said a celebrity.

1162
01:27:12,674 --> 01:27:14,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that comes to mind for any of you?

1163
01:27:15,394 --> 01:27:16,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly, I'm like drawing a blank.

1164
01:27:16,955 --> 01:27:17,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

1165
01:27:19,738 --> 01:27:24,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of a weird thought.

1166
01:27:24,702 --> 01:27:37,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean... What if one of those celebrities, if they were suddenly back, if their very presence, alive, disrupted the entire space continuum... Or if they got brought back as a zombie.

1167
01:27:37,654 --> 01:27:38,554
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Rob.

1168
01:27:39,275 --> 01:27:42,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we'd have to shoot them in the head, and we couldn't remember them in a nice way.

1169
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:43,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see...

1170
01:27:45,325 --> 01:27:46,726
[SPEAKER_02]: God, the name escapes me right now.

1171
01:27:46,826 --> 01:27:48,107
[SPEAKER_02]: A totally famous guy.

1172
01:27:48,127 --> 01:27:49,568
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that was with the NRA.

1173
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:51,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for my cold, dead hands.

1174
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:51,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlton Heston, was that it?

1175
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:52,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlton Heston, yeah.

1176
01:27:52,511 --> 01:27:54,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see him reanimated as a zombie.

1177
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:59,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the celebrity from the... I want to see Brittany What's-Her-Fuck come back as a zombie so we can shoot her.

1178
01:28:01,438 --> 01:28:02,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Rude, rude, rude.

1179
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,761
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this is my whole thing.

1180
01:28:06,101 --> 01:28:14,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand mourning the loss of, like, someone's contribution, but you didn't know the person, you know?

1181
01:28:14,844 --> 01:28:16,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good suggestion from chat.

1182
01:28:16,264 --> 01:28:18,265
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a couple people yelling out Phil Hartman.

1183
01:28:18,925 --> 01:28:21,286
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a very tragic thing that happened.

1184
01:28:21,866 --> 01:28:23,226
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my whole thing.

1185
01:28:23,266 --> 01:28:28,348
[SPEAKER_09]: When people die, it's typically when they're supposed to.

1186
01:28:29,628 --> 01:28:33,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it might seem stupid, it happens when it happens.

1187
01:28:33,589 --> 01:28:36,270
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't see any point in wishing for something that's not going to happen.

1188
01:28:37,391 --> 01:28:39,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't want to see anyone reanimated.

1189
01:28:39,491 --> 01:28:42,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the whole zombie thing totally makes me want to puke.

1190
01:28:43,061 --> 01:28:45,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, was there something smartass you wanted to add?

1191
01:28:45,463 --> 01:28:47,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no, I just had to see when someone died.

1192
01:28:47,724 --> 01:28:49,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh... Yes?

1193
01:28:49,385 --> 01:28:50,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Just checking real quick.

1194
01:28:50,646 --> 01:28:50,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

1195
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:51,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it!

1196
01:28:51,266 --> 01:28:51,907
[SPEAKER_03]: That was in 94.

1197
01:28:52,107 --> 01:28:52,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1198
01:28:52,908 --> 01:28:54,369
[SPEAKER_03]: No John Candy, unfortunately.

1199
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:54,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

1200
01:28:55,449 --> 01:29:01,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I guess I'm gonna have to go with my original thought, which was Michael Jackson, because I'd like to see him do his actual comeback.

1201
01:29:02,974 --> 01:29:06,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, all sorts of fun that would be involved with that.

1202
01:29:07,357 --> 01:29:07,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1203
01:29:08,338 --> 01:29:09,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, um...

1204
01:29:10,592 --> 01:29:15,093
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt sent us this on Twitter, which is a link to a story.

1205
01:29:15,533 --> 01:29:17,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Police followed an Xbox trailer.

1206
01:29:17,194 --> 01:29:17,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1207
01:29:18,134 --> 01:29:18,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I take that back.

1208
01:29:19,174 --> 01:29:19,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I renege that.

1209
01:29:20,735 --> 01:29:24,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see... Oh, God, what's his name?

1210
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:31,798
[SPEAKER_02]: The chatroom is correcting themselves, by the way.

1211
01:29:31,838 --> 01:29:32,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil Hartman died in 98.

1212
01:29:32,838 --> 01:29:34,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not Phil Hartman.

1213
01:29:37,641 --> 01:29:46,310
[SPEAKER_02]: The other guy, the other pitchman Billy Mays Hi, Billy Mays here As a zombie No, not as a zombie

1214
01:29:47,654 --> 01:29:48,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see that episode of South Park?

1215
01:29:49,775 --> 01:29:51,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant, that show.

1216
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, back to SSJ100.

1217
01:29:53,298 --> 01:29:54,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt's tweet, thank you very much.

1218
01:29:54,818 --> 01:30:00,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Sent us to a story from LOHUD.com talking about police following an Xbox trail.

1219
01:30:01,743 --> 01:30:12,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess because this guy in the Bronx was playing with a stolen Xbox 360 game system, it led them to a stash of stolen property, 200 car break-ins, and a couple of burglaries.

1220
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,711
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very excited to recover all this.

1221
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:34,972
[SPEAKER_02]: They went to, oh I love when they give the address in the story, it was 4064 Laconia Avenue in the Bronx is where all this stuff was hiding Apparently, they got a search warrant, they traced through Microsoft and the ISP where this stolen Xbox was being played from And it led them to a GPS system, laptop computers and all this stuff

1222
01:30:35,618 --> 01:30:42,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, looks like all this stuff was retrieved from 22-year-old Jeremiah, Jeremiah Gilliam's bedroom.

1223
01:30:43,442 --> 01:30:46,043
[SPEAKER_02]: To Jeremiah Gilliam, we say, uh-huh.

1224
01:30:47,464 --> 01:30:48,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time, don't be stupid.

1225
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:57,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Stealing things is pretty stupid in the first place, but then, like, when you go and, like, play with the stolen goods on the internet, that just makes you stupid or stupid.

1226
01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:00,491
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's face it, you're pretty stupid to be stealing shit in the first place.

1227
01:31:00,511 --> 01:31:01,972
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes someone extra stupid.

1228
01:31:02,529 --> 01:31:15,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, he probably wouldn't think that they would be tracking the system, and it's almost likely that they wouldn't know what the system's serial number and that kind of stuff was, but apparently they were able to track that via history and stuff like that.

1229
01:31:16,466 --> 01:31:18,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Dedication to them for trying to get it back to the Xbox 360.

1230
01:31:20,117 --> 01:31:25,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we got a link from DJ Ranma S on Twitter is linking us to another kind of local New York thing.

1231
01:31:26,682 --> 01:31:28,944
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming from Gizmodo, which is kind of interesting.

1232
01:31:29,024 --> 01:31:33,107
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with the iPhone, which some would argue is pretty much a gaming device in this day and age.

1233
01:31:33,527 --> 01:31:40,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the iPhone is not purchasable on AT&T's website if you use a New York City zip code.

1234
01:31:40,653 --> 01:31:42,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Because according to a rep at...

1235
01:31:43,755 --> 01:31:44,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess online.

1236
01:31:44,776 --> 01:31:46,356
[SPEAKER_02]: New York is not ready for the iPhone.

1237
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:50,438
[SPEAKER_02]: You've heard about all these types of complaints where in New York City, like, they can't handle the iPhone bandwidth.

1238
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:53,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Calls are getting dropped left and right and all this crazy stuff.

1239
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yikes.

1240
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:56,842
[SPEAKER_03]: But their 3G's better!

1241
01:31:57,002 --> 01:31:58,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Their commercials say so!

1242
01:31:58,783 --> 01:32:01,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I to believe that Luke Wilson is lying to me?

1243
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:04,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't handle that!

1244
01:32:05,946 --> 01:32:07,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That's shocking!

1245
01:32:09,338 --> 01:32:12,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably just some type of weird, creepy bug.

1246
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:15,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think AT&T is going to acknowledge that this has any weight to it whatsoever.

1247
01:32:32,864 --> 01:32:41,292
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently also Tigerclaw wants to add in our chatroom, you can still go into a phone and get a, or sorry, still go into a phone, still go into a store and get the phone that way.

1248
01:32:42,413 --> 01:32:43,114
[SPEAKER_02]: A little strange.

1249
01:32:45,342 --> 01:32:48,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, also going to some other news stories that were submitted.

1250
01:32:49,305 --> 01:32:58,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray Ayanami sends us this link to Kitsui was announced for the Japanese Xbox 360s at what's called the Cave Festival.

1251
01:32:59,372 --> 01:33:00,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a shooting game.

1252
01:33:01,653 --> 01:33:03,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Kitsui Kizuna

1253
01:33:04,435 --> 01:33:31,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Jigoku Tachi Extra is coming out on the 360 that'll cost you about $50 and it's another shmup that's coming to the Xbox 360 which has been getting a lot of those but you can see some screenshots online at this shmups.system11.org web forum where they actually show people playing at Akihabara at the Cave Festival this new game and there's even some footage on the internets but there's a lot of background noise I don't want to play that for you right now

1254
01:33:32,428 --> 01:33:41,916
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple stories coming to us from TigerClaw305 who is sending us some stories about, let's see, TimeGate has sued South Peak for royalties and breach of contract.

1255
01:33:43,358 --> 01:33:47,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently this is the folks who developed Section 8, TimeGate Studios.

1256
01:33:47,361 --> 01:33:50,324
[SPEAKER_02]: They have sued South Peak because of a breach of contract.

1257
01:33:50,604 --> 01:33:58,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the publisher is withholding royalty payments and violates the deal with a PS3 porting deal with a Russian company.

1258
01:34:02,434 --> 01:34:14,981
[SPEAKER_02]: TimeGate What's Compensatory Damages According to the report, South Peak says that because they got in 2008 Gamecock, it exempts it from some of the specifics of the original agreement.

1259
01:34:16,002 --> 01:34:18,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So yet more legal troubles.

1260
01:34:20,285 --> 01:34:21,345
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be settled out of court.

1261
01:34:21,385 --> 01:34:21,966
[SPEAKER_02]: They always are.

1262
01:34:22,186 --> 01:34:23,306
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how those things go, yeah?

1263
01:34:23,326 --> 01:34:26,889
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what'll happen.

1264
01:34:27,856 --> 01:34:35,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, also, what's also very interesting, the CEO of 3D Realms has teased a Duke Nukem resurgence.

1265
01:34:35,687 --> 01:34:37,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, here we go again.

1266
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:41,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently numerous Duke Nukem games are in various stages of development.

1267
01:34:41,856 --> 01:34:43,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, does that include Duke Nukem Forever?

1268
01:34:44,099 --> 01:35:13,469
[SPEAKER_02]: funny that you should mention Duke Nukem because remember there was supposed to be the PSP and DS versions that were coming out in September oh but those have been delayed just like Duke Nukem now I want to point out the CEO of 3D Realms did go out of his way to point out Duke Nukem Forever was not technically cancelled yes we released the initial team but that doesn't correlate to the demise of the project great so this will be now what our third decade of Duke Nukem Forever rumors we're going to get into goody goody

1269
01:35:15,259 --> 01:35:20,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Our good friend Maren Marvel has tweeted us and said, What do you guys think about the Blizzard Authenticator?

1270
01:35:22,828 --> 01:35:24,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a really good idea.

1271
01:35:24,330 --> 01:35:25,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it.

1272
01:35:26,505 --> 01:35:30,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my account hacked, and I will never undo the authenticator because of it.

1273
01:35:30,866 --> 01:35:33,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're an iPhone or iTouch user, it's free.

1274
01:35:33,907 --> 01:35:35,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get a free pet out of it.

1275
01:35:35,707 --> 01:35:39,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you don't have an iPhone or an iTouch, it's like $6.50 for the keychain.

1276
01:35:39,988 --> 01:35:44,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, considering they're also charging $10 for a pet, it's not a bad deal.

1277
01:35:44,889 --> 01:35:47,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does keep your account relatively safe.

1278
01:35:47,729 --> 01:35:51,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's unfortunate that Blizzard won't do more.

1279
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:53,431
[SPEAKER_02]: against these gold spammers and things.

1280
01:35:53,471 --> 01:36:02,155
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, what they're doing, they're hacking a lot of American accounts and going into the games and rolling level one characters and doing all the shouts and so forth.

1281
01:36:02,395 --> 01:36:03,396
[SPEAKER_09]: How well does the app work?

1282
01:36:03,796 --> 01:36:03,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1283
01:36:04,616 --> 01:36:05,497
[SPEAKER_09]: How well does the app work?

1284
01:36:05,517 --> 01:36:06,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Never had a problem with it.

1285
01:36:06,357 --> 01:36:10,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much all you do, you boot it up and it brings you up the code right away.

1286
01:36:10,499 --> 01:36:11,780
[SPEAKER_09]: But is that one that you have to pay for?

1287
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:12,340
No.

1288
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:13,340
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a free app.

1289
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then I'll just download it right now.

1290
01:36:14,881 --> 01:36:15,901
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1291
01:36:34,076 --> 01:36:34,996
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1292
01:36:58,764 --> 01:37:27,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I wish Blizzard would sue people I wish they would just start blocking IPs from maybe regions that are in America I mean I hate to say it but you know what there is WoW localized for other regions so maybe it's time to start locking players out from certain regions I hate to say it but if that's the way we're going to prevent but you know you can always IP spoof and all this other crazy stuff but I just wish the burden wasn't on us but hey it's free

1293
01:37:29,681 --> 01:37:33,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, one more question from JazayJazz on Twitter.

1294
01:37:34,204 --> 01:37:36,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you think games are headed in the new year?

1295
01:37:37,926 --> 01:37:40,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital distribution is going to be huge in the next decade.

1296
01:37:41,028 --> 01:37:47,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of these game stores are going to have to change their business model or there's a lot to lose in the coming decade.

1297
01:37:47,392 --> 01:37:50,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I think digital distribution is going to be huge in the upcoming next few years.

1298
01:37:50,794 --> 01:37:52,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where games are headed online.

1299
01:37:55,281 --> 01:37:55,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

1300
01:37:55,942 --> 01:38:01,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, we've been seeing it happen more and more, especially since Sony's been really adopting it.

1301
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:05,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably more digital distribution, but I don't really think things are going to change too much.

1302
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:09,536
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to probably try to push 3D, because that's the next big thing.

1303
01:38:10,056 --> 01:38:11,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And now with the two...

1304
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:35,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really see, I guess truly next-gen consoles, because Wii's kind of recycled hardware if you ask me, but now they're coming out with their 3D controllers, so that's really going to be the pushes for 3D, and you're going to see almost like a new console generation kind of being formed from this.

1305
01:38:36,047 --> 01:38:39,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I honestly would not expect to see all new consoles until, like, 2013, 14.

1306
01:38:40,029 --> 01:38:44,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's gonna be a ways out, I think, especially with these motion and stuff.

1307
01:38:44,732 --> 01:38:45,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for Nintendo.

1308
01:38:45,852 --> 01:38:48,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless... I think Nintendo will have something very soon.

1309
01:38:49,254 --> 01:38:51,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it just flops and dies, you know.

1310
01:38:53,116 --> 01:38:55,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think from Nintendo, I don't think we're gonna see anything really new.

1311
01:38:56,979 --> 01:38:59,260
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's probably just gonna be an upgrade.

1312
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:03,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to point out some comments from our chat room on some of those tweets.

1313
01:39:04,162 --> 01:39:08,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Misty wants to point out in our chat room, chat.orangelandrita.com Fuck that, Rob.

1314
01:39:08,184 --> 01:39:16,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep my eye touch with me all the damn time and in my pocket at work because due to some shit that happened around work last year, I'm paranoid about my eye touch getting jacked.

1315
01:39:16,189 --> 01:39:17,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's unfortunate.

1316
01:39:17,249 --> 01:39:19,431
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to those stupid people that cause you to be paranoid.

1317
01:39:20,171 --> 01:39:26,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I get some people, yes, they do have their eye touch with them all the time, but I also know some people that, you know, they only have it at home or at work.

1318
01:39:26,595 --> 01:39:28,036
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they don't really carry it with them everywhere.

1319
01:39:28,076 --> 01:39:28,356
[SPEAKER_02]: So just...

1320
01:39:29,016 --> 01:39:33,095
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what your habits are if you do have your eye touch with you all the time then maybe the blizzard thing is a good idea

1321
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:40,831
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt kind of jokes, I don't know if this is a joke or real, but Blizzard banning IPs in Korea is an act of war, Rob.

1322
01:39:41,772 --> 01:39:56,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying ban Korea or whatever country you want to name from the games, but if you have a game that has US servers that's meant to be played by the US that's localized for the US, Korea gets their own version of the games.

1323
01:39:56,635 --> 01:39:58,315
[SPEAKER_02]: WoW's been localized for China.

1324
01:39:58,695 --> 01:40:00,096
[SPEAKER_02]: WoW's out in other countries.

1325
01:40:00,136 --> 01:40:00,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1326
01:40:01,877 --> 01:40:07,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, unfortunately if all the gold farming is coming from China, maybe it's time to put some restrictions down.

1327
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:13,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they also need to place some restrictions on who can do these shouts and chat and so forth.

1328
01:40:14,652 --> 01:40:16,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Blizzard's done a really good job over the years though.

1329
01:40:17,173 --> 01:40:21,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's face it, every time they involve the gold hackers and the gold farmers have to get a little smarter.

1330
01:40:22,776 --> 01:40:26,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to make it sound like Blizzard's done nothing because they really have done a lot.

1331
01:40:26,977 --> 01:40:30,479
[SPEAKER_02]: They've gotten smart about how they do trial accounts and a lot of the various aspects of WoW.

1332
01:40:30,939 --> 01:40:36,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sucks that they just won't play hardball and start suing the pants off of some of these people that exploit their game.

1333
01:40:36,401 --> 01:40:37,342
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1334
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:42,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to see heads roll over my account getting hacked.

1335
01:40:44,491 --> 01:40:47,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Twitter topics for tonight.

1336
01:40:47,812 --> 01:40:51,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some of the year-end news.

1337
01:40:51,632 --> 01:40:58,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll start off talking about some of our favorite games of the year and games you might call your game of the year.

1338
01:40:58,493 --> 01:41:04,634
[SPEAKER_02]: In chatroom, we're taking your submissions as well and I'll try to keep an eye on the Twitter too for those of you that can't be in chat.

1339
01:41:04,674 --> 01:41:07,575
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of your picks for the game of the year and why?

1340
01:41:08,275 --> 01:41:13,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I find these Game of the Year picks to be a little silly, because it's just one person's opinion.

1341
01:41:13,839 --> 01:41:17,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep that in mind as we talk about our favorite games of the year.

1342
01:41:17,662 --> 01:41:23,967
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just gamers, we like what we like, and this is our opinion for the game that you think was the most important game of 2009.

1343
01:41:25,308 --> 01:41:26,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start with Loki tonight.

1344
01:41:26,689 --> 01:41:27,550
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think, Loki?

1345
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:32,373
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think were, and if you have a couple, go ahead, but what do you think overall was probably the biggest game of 2009?

1346
01:41:33,514 --> 01:41:48,842
[SPEAKER_03]: of 2009, well, probably Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was, but I didn't play that game, so, the game I liked, or at least, just, if I was gonna vote based on how much I played it, I'd say Grand Theft Auto, mainly the two expansions, because that's what I was ending up playing, and, um,

1347
01:41:50,366 --> 01:42:09,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of neat because whereas before we wouldn't really see expansions for Grand Theft Auto we'd just see a couple other games kind of using the same engine and still we may see that relatively soon but it was kind of neat to kind of expand upon the story and kind of bring different perspectives to it and what not and it was fun.

1348
01:42:09,532 --> 01:42:16,914
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of brought back some of the old stuff that I thought should have been in there in the first place a lot of the over the top stuff because they wanted to keep it grounded in reality whatever

1349
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,771
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of, you know, my favorite of the year.

1350
01:42:22,171 --> 01:42:24,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Other important games, I think DJ Hero was pretty big.

1351
01:42:25,012 --> 01:42:31,254
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, kind of a different take on the whole music game genre, and I kind of like that.

1352
01:42:31,794 --> 01:42:35,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought DJ Hero was horrifically underrated, and it's kind of sad.

1353
01:42:35,335 --> 01:42:37,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, a lot of people were writing it off as a failure.

1354
01:42:37,536 --> 01:42:44,598
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, in looking at my Twitter and my Facebook, it seems like DJ Hero was a big-time Christmas present that was showing up for a lot of people, so...

1355
01:42:45,803 --> 01:42:49,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it'll find a second life of sorts as we get in past the holidays.

1356
01:42:50,046 --> 01:42:56,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And also some of the other underrated Wii games, you know, more of the mature stuff like Mad World.

1357
01:42:56,769 --> 01:42:58,190
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I love that game.

1358
01:42:58,230 --> 01:42:59,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty fun.

1359
01:42:59,691 --> 01:43:04,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, you know, unfortunately a lot of the mature stuff doesn't do well.

1360
01:43:04,934 --> 01:43:06,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when they don't put a lot of press behind it.

1361
01:43:06,775 --> 01:43:09,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is, you know, some commercials and stuff, but I don't think...

1362
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:15,259
[SPEAKER_03]: The mature audience is really that big right now on the Wii, which is too bad.

1363
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:18,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of people have kind of given up on it and just went elsewhere.

1364
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd have to vote that.

1365
01:43:21,701 --> 01:43:24,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, unfortunately, I didn't play a lot of other stuff.

1366
01:43:24,203 --> 01:43:27,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure Borderlands would be on my list if I had actually played that this year.

1367
01:43:28,404 --> 01:43:31,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still time, but it's unfortunate.

1368
01:43:32,066 --> 01:43:34,387
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was probably a good one.

1369
01:43:35,467 --> 01:43:38,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure a little bit of, I'm sure, Infamous...

1370
01:43:39,309 --> 01:43:40,129
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1371
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:16,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, we gotta joke and say it, uh, President Cat, very strange and absolutely, uh, weird game to come out, but, uh, I think it could do well over here.

1372
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:19,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's, seriously, there's so much crap that comes out in the Wii.

1373
01:44:19,661 --> 01:44:21,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why anybody couldn't take a chance.

1374
01:44:21,802 --> 01:44:28,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are companies like this, Graffiti Entertainment, uh, Axis Game Localization, I mean, fuck, they're bringing over Choniki.

1375
01:44:29,524 --> 01:44:30,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, man.

1376
01:44:30,624 --> 01:44:31,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the gamble.

1377
01:44:32,921 --> 01:44:35,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki's named about 20 different games for his game of the year.

1378
01:44:35,793 --> 01:44:37,159
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think, DarkSakura?

1379
01:44:37,179 --> 01:44:38,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Is your list as long?

1380
01:44:39,028 --> 01:44:43,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not, given that I... I mean, Sims 3 came out, and that was big for me.

1381
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:46,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I actually really enjoy Sims 3.

1382
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:54,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't gotten World Adventures, but that was... Especially now they've got out the Build a World thing for Sims 3.

1383
01:44:54,314 --> 01:44:55,254
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually pretty cool.

1384
01:44:55,414 --> 01:45:04,898
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that, of course, it didn't take too long for all of the modders to start putting out their own hacks to the game and their own items and stuff.

1385
01:45:04,958 --> 01:45:05,878
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was pretty cool.

1386
01:45:06,678 --> 01:45:08,139
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, I love building houses.

1387
01:45:10,742 --> 01:45:16,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Other stuff... Yeah, I've really been enjoying Dan play Borderlands.

1388
01:45:16,366 --> 01:45:18,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't play it because I get motion sick.

1389
01:45:18,548 --> 01:45:20,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got my Silent Hill that I haven't played yet.

1390
01:45:22,371 --> 01:45:28,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say, though, Street Fighter 4 was really big for me, especially getting Sakura in the home release made me happy.

1391
01:45:28,736 --> 01:45:31,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Because then I could kick Dan's butt and be happy about it.

1392
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:36,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, though, we got it right around the time my hand was really in bad shape.

1393
01:45:36,762 --> 01:45:39,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to also second Tatsunoko vs. Capcom because...

1394
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:42,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, big Tatsunoko fan for me.

1395
01:45:42,755 --> 01:45:44,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Big Capcom fan.

1396
01:45:44,177 --> 01:45:47,879
[SPEAKER_09]: So the two together was just like a squeagasm in the process.

1397
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:58,908
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember sitting on the couch and being in absolute pain and still insisting on trying to beat the stupid bouncing ball in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

1398
01:45:59,248 --> 01:46:01,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, look, they're playing the Gachapon music!

1399
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:03,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, they're playing the Gachapon music!

1400
01:46:03,432 --> 01:46:04,112
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so happy!

1401
01:46:04,653 --> 01:46:04,933
[SPEAKER_09]: You know...

1402
01:46:05,863 --> 01:46:08,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Big, big squeegasm for me.

1403
01:46:08,546 --> 01:46:10,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you looking forward to the localization next year?

1404
01:46:10,468 --> 01:46:11,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah!

1405
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:14,332
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as they leave most of it in Japanese.

1406
01:46:16,614 --> 01:46:18,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, they've got the voice actors.

1407
01:46:18,836 --> 01:46:20,138
[SPEAKER_09]: How can you go wrong with that?

1408
01:46:22,299 --> 01:46:38,073
[SPEAKER_02]: um let's see my I would say there's probably three games I would bestow the game of the year honor upon one of them you'll say okay yeah I see that because it's something everybody else named uh one of them you'll say damn it Rob why'd you have to say that and then the other one you're gonna go lol what the fuck

1409
01:46:39,417 --> 01:46:39,858
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki,

1410
01:46:54,397 --> 01:46:54,997
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1411
01:47:14,992 --> 01:47:15,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1412
01:47:15,712 --> 01:47:18,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I would say new Super Mario Bros.

1413
01:47:18,134 --> 01:47:22,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii is definitely worthy of the praise of Game of the Year for some of the same reasons.

1414
01:47:22,598 --> 01:47:26,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And it pains me when Nintendo does this because, damn it.

1415
01:47:26,862 --> 01:47:27,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Nintendo...

1416
01:47:29,878 --> 01:47:31,539
[SPEAKER_02]: They really did get it right in...

1417
01:47:55,411 --> 01:48:01,134
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't want to touch Mario Galaxy, as great of a game as that is, because it's like, what?

1418
01:48:01,414 --> 01:48:02,094
[SPEAKER_02]: 3D Mario?

1419
01:48:02,174 --> 01:48:03,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't control?

1420
01:48:03,675 --> 01:48:04,315
[SPEAKER_02]: A little weird.

1421
01:48:04,676 --> 01:48:05,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But New Super Mario Bros.

1422
01:48:05,756 --> 01:48:07,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii kind of takes Mario back to its roots.

1423
01:48:08,017 --> 01:48:09,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, oh, jump on Goomba.

1424
01:48:09,798 --> 01:48:10,538
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty funny.

1425
01:48:10,879 --> 01:48:11,719
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty fun.

1426
01:48:11,879 --> 01:48:14,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's absolute chaos getting a bunch of people together.

1427
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:19,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It is hell in four-player mode, but I still kind of applaud Nintendo for making it work, so to speak.

1428
01:48:21,484 --> 01:48:23,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was an awesome game.

1429
01:48:24,445 --> 01:48:27,847
[SPEAKER_02]: It brought a lot of gamers back to gaming.

1430
01:48:27,927 --> 01:48:34,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you want to hate Nintendo for this, but like I said, it's a diamond in the rough of the Wii software that's out there.

1431
01:48:35,427 --> 01:48:38,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my LOL what the fuck pick for game of the year.

1432
01:48:38,309 --> 01:48:40,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly think it's deserving.

1433
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:43,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people are forgetting that this game is from this year.

1434
01:48:43,712 --> 01:48:47,855
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is absolutely one of the best things to happen to gaming this year.

1435
01:48:48,515 --> 01:48:50,516
[SPEAKER_02]: 1 versus 100 on Xbox Live.

1436
01:48:50,717 --> 01:48:54,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I think absolutely deserves the accolade of one of the games of the years.

1437
01:48:54,659 --> 01:48:55,339
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1438
01:49:13,286 --> 01:49:16,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat that you're actually playing for real money.

1439
01:49:16,548 --> 01:49:19,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's such a different type of game.

1440
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:23,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it such props for being new, different, and fun.

1441
01:49:23,954 --> 01:49:28,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Best of all, if you happen to be an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, it's free.

1442
01:49:29,397 --> 01:49:31,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even the Silver folks got it free for a little while.

1443
01:49:31,819 --> 01:49:34,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's fair to say that this game was free.

1444
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:37,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So, how can you go wrong?

1445
01:49:37,463 --> 01:49:41,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 1 versus 100, in some ways, is the game of the year.

1446
01:49:42,006 --> 01:50:01,558
[SPEAKER_02]: and for whoever was asking earlier where are games going in the future I'll bet you see some more stuff like this the interactive stuff I think it's going to be very cool to see how that plays out in the next decade so check that out so those were our games of the year what about you guys in our chat room some of you guys were naming some of your things here

1447
01:50:04,141 --> 01:50:05,902
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru says, what's wrong with Street Fighter 3?

1448
01:50:06,483 --> 01:50:11,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, it's pandering to the base, but still, I don't want to buy Street Fighter 4 when Super Street Fighter 4 is coming out.

1449
01:50:12,187 --> 01:50:17,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was unfortunate that Super Street Fighter 4 was announced kind of soon because, you know, it devalued the original.

1450
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:23,674
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we had Street Fighter 2 and Super Street Fighter 2, so I guess it's nothing too unheard of there.

1451
01:50:24,315 --> 01:50:25,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, um...

1452
01:50:27,662 --> 01:50:30,524
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says Game of the Year for me is Batman Arkham Asylum.

1453
01:50:30,544 --> 01:50:31,825
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that did get a lot of props.

1454
01:50:32,686 --> 01:50:34,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good storytelling in that game.

1455
01:50:34,247 --> 01:50:37,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly panders to fans of Batman in the comic form.

1456
01:50:37,950 --> 01:50:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a really good job with that game.

1457
01:50:40,031 --> 01:50:41,112
[SPEAKER_02]: They really did.

1458
01:50:43,134 --> 01:50:48,378
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I really, really liked Harley in that game.

1459
01:50:48,778 --> 01:50:50,900
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's actually a game that convinced one of my friends to get an Xbox.

1460
01:50:51,414 --> 01:50:52,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good storytelling.

1461
01:50:53,016 --> 01:50:53,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

1462
01:50:53,796 --> 01:50:56,359
[SPEAKER_02]: SJ100Matt says, from the sports side here, NHL 10.

1463
01:50:57,219 --> 01:51:01,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only was it great, but it beat out Madden 10 for the best sports game at the VGAs.

1464
01:51:01,844 --> 01:51:03,785
[SPEAKER_02]: A hockey game beating out a football game?

1465
01:51:03,886 --> 01:51:04,146
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1466
01:51:05,353 --> 01:51:14,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've also got a contribution from Marin, Beatles Rock Band, which actually I'm going to have to go with as well, but he knows she'd say that.

1467
01:51:14,956 --> 01:51:15,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

1468
01:51:15,416 --> 01:51:16,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Heart, heart, heart.

1469
01:51:16,617 --> 01:51:19,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatles Rock Band was an excellent implementation.

1470
01:51:19,757 --> 01:51:23,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still opting for DJ Hero as my music game of the year, but I...

1471
01:51:24,927 --> 01:51:30,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I do respect greatly Beatles rock band and I think it was badly needed.

1472
01:51:30,148 --> 01:51:31,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I think getting it out was a big achievement.

1473
01:51:32,169 --> 01:51:33,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so too.

1474
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:38,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to get everybody on stage at E3 to announce it, that was epic.

1475
01:51:38,651 --> 01:51:47,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, having Yoko Ono, George Harrison's wife, McCartney, Ringo Starr, all on stage at once, pretty awesome.

1476
01:51:49,014 --> 01:51:49,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty, pretty awesome.

1477
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:59,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of some of the things that happened this year, just kind of like trekking back, and it's kind of funny to look back sometimes on what happened in previous months, kind of see where that put us this year.

1478
01:52:00,107 --> 01:52:02,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Just quickly going through some of the big things that happened this year.

1479
01:52:02,289 --> 01:52:08,395
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at January and some of the things that happened there, a lot of restructuring and layoff news.

1480
01:52:08,455 --> 01:52:11,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony did some restructuring and announced a $2.9 billion loss.

1481
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:12,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft...

1482
01:52:13,379 --> 01:52:14,460
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1483
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:45,190
[SPEAKER_02]: and interesting because maybe that indie development is going to lead to more digital distribution as we talked about before.

1484
01:52:47,393 --> 01:52:47,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1485
01:52:48,033 --> 01:52:49,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to February.

1486
01:52:49,754 --> 01:52:50,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things that happened there.

1487
01:52:51,375 --> 01:52:52,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, more losses.

1488
01:52:52,756 --> 01:52:55,217
[SPEAKER_02]: EA cut back 11% of their workforce.

1489
01:52:55,617 --> 01:52:58,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Activision, Blizzard, I don't know how the hell they lost money, but they sure did.

1490
01:52:59,399 --> 01:53:02,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did not do any huge layoffs, though, at that time.

1491
01:53:03,341 --> 01:53:10,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, though, what I thought was interesting, Wii Fit sold 777,000 copies in January.

1492
01:53:10,545 --> 01:53:12,666
[SPEAKER_02]: That news would then roll over to February.

1493
01:53:13,127 --> 01:53:13,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1494
01:53:14,447 --> 01:53:19,830
[SPEAKER_02]: WeFit was obviously a big piece of gaming in 2009 that none of us named in our game of the year.

1495
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:23,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Has WeFit been good or bad for gaming?

1496
01:53:23,492 --> 01:53:24,092
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

1497
01:53:25,133 --> 01:53:33,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't say in terms of gaming, but it's definitely been good in terms of making exercise enjoyable.

1498
01:53:34,137 --> 01:53:36,298
[SPEAKER_09]: WeFit is not something that I really consider to be a game.

1499
01:53:37,099 --> 01:53:38,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I consider it to be a tool.

1500
01:53:38,799 --> 01:53:39,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun tech demo.

1501
01:53:40,305 --> 01:53:40,906
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1502
01:53:57,802 --> 01:53:58,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Game Game Game

1503
01:54:26,295 --> 01:54:28,076
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to see a party-free 2010?

1504
01:54:29,257 --> 01:54:32,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see them actually go back to what worked before.

1505
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:33,781
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't necessarily need the change.

1506
01:54:34,942 --> 01:54:36,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Make some good side-scrolling games.

1507
01:54:36,503 --> 01:54:39,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Make some good games that utilize the technology.

1508
01:54:40,386 --> 01:54:41,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything doesn't have to be a party game.

1509
01:54:41,887 --> 01:54:44,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything doesn't have to be a waggle-fest.

1510
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:47,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it what worked!

1511
01:54:47,401 --> 01:54:48,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't understand it.

1512
01:54:48,362 --> 01:54:58,469
[SPEAKER_03]: We had, you know, a lot of games selling back in the day of, like, the Super Nintendo and stuff, and even the NES and whatnot, and they didn't really rely on a lot of gimmicks.

1513
01:54:59,470 --> 01:55:02,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Made Mode 7, but I mean, come on, it wasn't that bad.

1514
01:55:03,584 --> 01:55:04,685
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1515
01:55:31,784 --> 01:55:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: and soon TVs later in the year, although of course that never happened.

1516
01:55:38,586 --> 01:55:40,327
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about OnLive in the future of that?

1517
01:55:40,647 --> 01:55:43,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if it works like they say it is, then it's a good thing.

1518
01:55:43,828 --> 01:55:52,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it'll be pretty popular because everybody's really digging the streaming stuff nowadays, especially with Netflix and other video services out there.

1519
01:55:52,711 --> 01:55:58,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And Steam as a digital distribution platform has done pretty well, so kind of combining the two...

1520
01:56:00,259 --> 01:56:00,819
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1521
01:56:23,294 --> 01:56:24,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the news as we moved into April.

1522
01:56:25,416 --> 01:56:26,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Will Wright left EA.

1523
01:56:27,818 --> 01:56:33,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of forgot that that happened, but that's when an epic designer leaves a big company like that.

1524
01:56:33,162 --> 01:56:34,904
[SPEAKER_02]: You always kind of wonder what the heck is going on there.

1525
01:56:35,624 --> 01:56:38,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the disappointing sales of Chinatown Wars.

1526
01:56:38,247 --> 01:56:43,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how in 2008, Nintendo got up there at E3 and said, hey, we've got a Grand Theft Auto game coming to the DS.

1527
01:56:43,871 --> 01:56:45,373
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome, and it's going to, you know...

1528
01:56:45,993 --> 01:56:46,854
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1529
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:07,740
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1530
01:57:28,695 --> 01:57:29,176
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

1531
01:57:29,596 --> 01:57:31,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so you can do it, but you just didn't.

1532
01:57:31,758 --> 01:57:33,520
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't really put the effort into it.

1533
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:36,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, you made these little mini games that involved the DS stylus.

1534
01:57:38,546 --> 01:57:42,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's neat and all, but it just really didn't hook me in like the other ones.

1535
01:57:44,492 --> 01:57:48,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my standards have gone up since 1 and 2.

1536
01:57:49,451 --> 01:57:54,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not a lot happened in May, but then we got into June, and June was, of course, the big E3 Expo.

1537
01:57:55,696 --> 01:58:09,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And at E3 was when we got a hell of a lot of news, including the unveiling of Project Natal from Microsoft, Sony showing their ice cream cone controller, whatever that thing is supposed to be for their motion sensing, and then Nintendo showing the Wii Vitality Sensor.

1538
01:58:10,649 --> 01:58:17,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking back on E3 this year, any kind of thoughts about how the show went or kind of where we are now six months later?

1539
01:58:18,433 --> 01:58:20,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I think everyone was still pooping themselves over Natal.

1540
01:58:21,935 --> 01:58:29,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that Nintendo disappointed once again, you know, not as bad as the year prior, but this year was kind of pathetic.

1541
01:58:30,059 --> 01:58:40,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I'm sorry, the Wii Vitality Sensor... Okay, remember with the Wii Fit Balance Board, it's like, oh, it's going to revolutionize how you do these exercise games and stuff?

1542
01:58:40,425 --> 01:58:47,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And great, now we have a bunch of these games that have the Balance Board sensors in there, and we use it, and okay, that's great.

1543
01:58:48,183 --> 01:58:54,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a real huge step, I guess, but it's neat nonetheless.

1544
01:58:54,387 --> 01:58:57,910
[SPEAKER_03]: The Vitality Sensor, I'm sorry, I don't see what the point is of this.

1545
01:58:58,670 --> 01:58:59,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't get it.

1546
01:58:59,611 --> 01:59:02,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know they're gonna have that stupid game, We Relax, come out.

1547
01:59:03,074 --> 01:59:06,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, you'll sell some copies of that, but I think it's crap.

1548
01:59:07,349 --> 01:59:09,651
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to that Metroid game that Team Ninja was doing?

1549
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:14,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we saw a neat little preview at E3 and, like, literally not a damn thing since then.

1550
01:59:14,216 --> 01:59:17,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's promises of stuff that'll come later on, like, next year.

1551
01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:20,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'll be surprised if that game comes out this year.

1552
01:59:21,083 --> 01:59:22,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be surprised.

1553
01:59:22,504 --> 01:59:22,764
[SPEAKER_02]: 2010, you mean?

1554
01:59:23,005 --> 01:59:23,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 2010.

1555
01:59:24,947 --> 01:59:29,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be surprised if it makes it out in 2010, but... I don't know, it's just...

1556
01:59:30,854 --> 01:59:31,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1557
01:59:49,443 --> 01:59:49,943
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming!

1558
01:59:50,364 --> 01:59:52,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry, just be patient.

1559
01:59:52,665 --> 01:59:54,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta play devil's advocate here, though, because of what I just said.

1560
01:59:55,407 --> 02:00:01,392
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other things Nintendo revealed at E3 this year, which was not expected by any means, was new Super Mario Bros.

1561
02:00:01,472 --> 02:00:04,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii, which, I'm sorry, is one of the best games that came out this year.

1562
02:00:04,654 --> 02:00:05,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was.

1563
02:00:05,715 --> 02:00:12,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty sad that that's the best game that came out this year from Nintendo, a company that, you know, had really innovative games in the past.

1564
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:17,584
[SPEAKER_03]: All have been, you know, really great titles, except recently some of their games that they released are kind of, eh,

1565
02:00:18,024 --> 02:00:18,724
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whatever.

1566
02:00:18,964 --> 02:00:19,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care.

1567
02:00:20,545 --> 02:00:22,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, what did they release this year?

1568
02:00:22,686 --> 02:00:23,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me think here.

1569
02:00:24,887 --> 02:00:36,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had Wii Fit Plus, which was basically just a port of Wii Fit now with some added crap on there, and we're going to throw it in for a discount just to capitalize on Wii Fit again because people may have forgotten about it.

1570
02:00:36,691 --> 02:00:39,472
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Wii Sports Resort, which comes with an extra sensor.

1571
02:00:39,492 --> 02:00:41,853
[SPEAKER_03]: That really should have been in the Wii Remote to begin with.

1572
02:00:42,153 --> 02:00:47,035
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of what they really promised with the Wii from the get-go, but, oh, we just couldn't do it.

1573
02:00:47,495 --> 02:00:48,176
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1574
02:01:10,048 --> 02:01:10,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was great!

1575
02:01:10,989 --> 02:01:12,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great game that came out this year.

1576
02:01:12,709 --> 02:01:18,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that, okay, and then Metroid Prime Trilogy, which was just a rehash of some old stuff.

1577
02:01:18,452 --> 02:01:25,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they added the new Play Control series, which is basically ported GameCube games that they've added some Wii controls to.

1578
02:01:26,215 --> 02:01:26,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Great!

1579
02:01:26,896 --> 02:01:30,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you have the ability to port GameCube games and add Waggle to them.

1580
02:01:31,237 --> 02:01:32,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to be innovative.

1581
02:01:34,966 --> 02:01:36,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it's just, you know...

1582
02:02:00,959 --> 02:02:08,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I kid you not, the descriptions are almost identical, except they changed the name of the game, because some people might get fooled by that.

1583
02:02:10,279 --> 02:02:14,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And what did they have other than the Zelda game for the DS, which was kind of cool.

1584
02:02:15,443 --> 02:02:21,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, they had some style simulation game, because God forbid there's not enough of those on the DS.

1585
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:27,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Between Ubisoft and Dreamcatcher, there's so many damn games for girls.

1586
02:02:27,994 --> 02:02:30,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just got lost in the fray right there.

1587
02:02:30,476 --> 02:02:35,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of things that they released, I think Nintendo thinks that their name's going to sell these titles.

1588
02:02:36,041 --> 02:02:37,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not been the case.

1589
02:02:37,582 --> 02:02:41,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Fossil Fighters, hello, there's been other games that have been put out exactly the same as that.

1590
02:02:43,987 --> 02:02:45,288
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just they just don't get it.

1591
02:02:45,428 --> 02:02:50,432
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure they're going to promise some more stuff, maybe Pikmin 3, and then everyone will shit their pants because it's Pikmin 3.

1592
02:02:50,773 --> 02:02:54,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to come out, it's going to be exactly the same as Pikmin 2, just with some extra shit.

1593
02:02:54,936 --> 02:02:57,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are going to buy into it because they're fucking cheap.

1594
02:03:00,315 --> 02:03:01,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Galaxy 2 is on the way too

1595
02:03:30,051 --> 02:03:30,931
[SPEAKER_03]: New power-ups?

1596
02:03:31,612 --> 02:03:35,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, oh, I take everything back that I said about Nintendo.

1597
02:03:35,333 --> 02:03:38,314
[SPEAKER_03]: If they have new power-ups in there, then, god forbid, game of the year.

1598
02:03:40,675 --> 02:03:44,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And Super Mario Galaxy 2, yeah, I'm sure that'll be very different than Galaxy 1.

1599
02:03:44,616 --> 02:03:46,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we added some different levels now.

1600
02:03:47,097 --> 02:03:47,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Praise us.

1601
02:03:48,418 --> 02:03:54,620
[SPEAKER_03]: All the work's been done on the engine before, but now we have new levels and new gimmicks, and you're gonna think, oh my god, it's so awesome!

1602
02:03:57,161 --> 02:03:59,063
[SPEAKER_09]: and Yellen, that same little girly voice.

1603
02:03:59,383 --> 02:04:01,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll get Twilight Princess 2.

1604
02:04:01,064 --> 02:04:04,727
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be exactly the same as Twilight Princess 1, but it'll have some slightly new levels in it.

1605
02:04:04,907 --> 02:04:07,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll fuse them and do Majora's Princess.

1606
02:04:07,289 --> 02:04:08,870
[SPEAKER_02]: You know there's going to be the Zelda game.

1607
02:04:09,451 --> 02:04:11,752
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be the big thing they're going to unveil at E3 this year.

1608
02:04:11,792 --> 02:04:13,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark my words, 2010 predictions.

1609
02:04:13,674 --> 02:04:17,357
[SPEAKER_02]: New Zelda will be the thing that Nintendo tries to redeem themselves with this year.

1610
02:04:17,377 --> 02:04:19,058
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's great about Nintendo, though?

1611
02:04:19,158 --> 02:04:19,719
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com.

1612
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:37,145
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, anything that you want them to do correctly, they're never going to do anymore because, you know what, you'll buy their shit.

1613
02:04:37,646 --> 02:04:39,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I still stand by it.

1614
02:04:39,147 --> 02:04:47,796
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as you're calling it recycled garbage and all this stuff, if it's still a good game, like, I think Mario Galaxy 2 has the potential to be really awesome.

1615
02:04:48,097 --> 02:04:52,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Galaxy 1 was great, and if they just improve on that, it's going to get even better.

1616
02:04:53,996 --> 02:04:59,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't say that they don't have sequels and rehash shit on the 360 and the PS3 as well.

1617
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:01,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they do, and I call them out for it.

1618
02:05:03,422 --> 02:05:06,844
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a game that comes out every year that's a rehash of the last year's game.

1619
02:05:07,224 --> 02:05:08,005
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it Madden.

1620
02:05:09,265 --> 02:05:10,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And NBA Live.

1621
02:05:11,347 --> 02:05:12,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And NBA 2K.

1622
02:05:12,748 --> 02:05:13,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dance Dance Revolution.

1623
02:05:13,748 --> 02:05:14,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dance Dance Revolution.

1624
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:17,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And God forbid, you know, Call of Duty.

1625
02:05:18,811 --> 02:05:22,994
[SPEAKER_03]: No, um... There's a lot of companies that are guilty of that, but...

1626
02:05:24,397 --> 02:05:27,309
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that Nintendo has the balls To go, hey look

1627
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:30,982
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking these GameCube games and we're putting them on the Wii.

1628
02:05:31,162 --> 02:05:31,602
[SPEAKER_03]: They're new.

1629
02:05:32,242 --> 02:05:33,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're now on the Wii.

1630
02:05:34,164 --> 02:05:37,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have... We didn't really do anything to them other than change the controls.

1631
02:05:37,566 --> 02:05:41,068
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the case, where the fuck is my F-Zero?

1632
02:05:41,408 --> 02:05:45,531
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the one GameCube game I have yet to see come over to the Wii.

1633
02:05:45,851 --> 02:05:52,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And might I point out, not only is it just a GameCube game, it was the best fucking GameCube game that ever came out.

1634
02:05:52,615 --> 02:05:57,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sorry, they have to do Donkey Kong's Jungle Beat first because apparently people like that

1635
02:05:58,118 --> 02:05:58,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Game.

1636
02:05:58,778 --> 02:06:01,419
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't sell very well with the bongos, but hey, you know.

1637
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:02,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1638
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:09,543
[SPEAKER_03]: We can also do a Donkey Kong racing game that used to be with the bongos, but uh, no, now we're just gonna add some sort of rival controls.

1639
02:06:09,563 --> 02:06:09,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Three words.

1640
02:06:10,083 --> 02:06:10,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Three words.

1641
02:06:11,063 --> 02:06:13,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck Donkey Kong.

1642
02:06:14,064 --> 02:06:20,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Donkey Kong is best left to the memory of the Super Nintendo, awesomely 3D rendered games, Donkey Kong countries that were there.

1643
02:06:21,327 --> 02:06:21,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over it.

1644
02:06:22,728 --> 02:06:23,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1645
02:06:24,368 --> 02:06:25,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my F-Zero game?

1646
02:06:27,247 --> 02:06:31,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, where's my good updated Star Fox?

1647
02:06:32,090 --> 02:06:35,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And they always manage to take their sequels and fuck them over in some way.

1648
02:06:35,932 --> 02:06:38,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example, Excite Truck.

1649
02:06:38,493 --> 02:06:40,334
[SPEAKER_03]: The best racing game on the Wii.

1650
02:06:41,054 --> 02:06:44,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Sequel, set to come out, ExciteBots Trick Racing.

1651
02:06:44,816 --> 02:06:46,137
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck did you do there?

1652
02:06:46,477 --> 02:06:47,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, people like Transformers.

1653
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:53,301
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck does throwing a pie at a clown have anything to do with racing?

1654
02:06:53,461 --> 02:06:55,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have anything to do with racing.

1655
02:06:56,454 --> 02:06:58,497
[SPEAKER_03]: and God forbid they just shit on that sequel.

1656
02:06:59,258 --> 02:07:05,206
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was an idiot and bought it because, you know, I had hope that it was going to be as good as the original, but no, it wasn't.

1657
02:07:06,869 --> 02:07:10,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Fool me once, you will not fool me twice.

1658
02:07:11,912 --> 02:07:14,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I see some chat, and the chat's kind of flying right now.

1659
02:07:14,794 --> 02:07:19,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really keep up with it, but I do see GameGuru saying something about the God of War collection.

1660
02:07:19,618 --> 02:07:21,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It's God of War 1 and 2 in HD.

1661
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:22,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr!

1662
02:07:22,141 --> 02:07:24,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, does that fall into... At least it's in HD.

1663
02:07:24,923 --> 02:07:30,067
[SPEAKER_03]: If they improve the graphics on the Wii games, on those new play control games, hey, that's different, okay?

1664
02:07:30,087 --> 02:07:32,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's, you know... What, would they have widescreen now?

1665
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:33,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1666
02:07:34,671 --> 02:07:36,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I take it all back.

1667
02:07:39,665 --> 02:07:47,910
[SPEAKER_02]: F-Zero on the GameCube had widescreen support.

1668
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:52,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It had, if I remember right, progressive scan support and all that fancy stuff on the GameCube.

1669
02:07:52,352 --> 02:07:53,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with God of War 2.

1670
02:07:53,132 --> 02:07:56,554
[SPEAKER_03]: That also had 720p support through a code.

1671
02:08:00,737 --> 02:08:00,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow.

1672
02:08:02,293 --> 02:08:03,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we move on past the Nintendo hatred?

1673
02:08:03,953 --> 02:08:04,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes we can.

1674
02:08:04,493 --> 02:08:06,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thousands of subscribers we just lost.

1675
02:08:06,994 --> 02:08:09,834
[SPEAKER_02]: All the Nintendo fanboys crying in the corner.

1676
02:08:10,414 --> 02:08:17,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I still stand by, you know what, again, the thing that pisses me off about Nintendo is that it's not that I don't disagree with Loki.

1677
02:08:18,536 --> 02:08:20,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of what he's saying I pretend to agree with.

1678
02:08:20,976 --> 02:08:26,717
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they release that one fucking game that's so fucking great I have to have it.

1679
02:08:26,817 --> 02:08:28,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And it justifies the purchase of a Wii.

1680
02:08:28,838 --> 02:08:30,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have all this shit

1681
02:08:31,258 --> 02:08:37,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Out there flooding the market in that one game on the goddamn Wii that you just aren't going to get anywhere else.

1682
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:39,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Like new Super Mario Bros.

1683
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:40,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii.

1684
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:46,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, okay, like Mario Kart, you know, Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64.

1685
02:08:46,441 --> 02:08:51,222
[SPEAKER_03]: The best fucking deathmatch, you know, battle mode ever was in those games.

1686
02:08:51,882 --> 02:08:55,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the GameCube and the Wii version, they just like...

1687
02:08:56,877 --> 02:08:58,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just fucking ruin it.

1688
02:08:59,319 --> 02:09:01,140
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't know what plays that.

1689
02:09:02,201 --> 02:09:03,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Who cares?

1690
02:09:03,441 --> 02:09:04,662
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just fuck it over.

1691
02:09:04,742 --> 02:09:06,924
[SPEAKER_12]: You think that's how the boardroom meetings go?

1692
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:36,251
[SPEAKER_03]: let's fuck this game up just for fun today we're in a recession let's have fun with it all they had to do was leave it exactly the same and just make new levels that's it, no improvement needed it was perfect the way it was but somehow they just go throwing it together and they just ruined the whole thing because they wanted to improve upon it way to go have you ever heard the phrase if it ain't broke don't fix it

1693
02:09:38,368 --> 02:09:39,389
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on.

1694
02:10:03,547 --> 02:10:04,668
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to Midway?

1695
02:10:30,662 --> 02:10:34,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Loki's ranting just got the temperature up in here about 10 degrees, so I needed to cool off a little bit.

1696
02:10:35,025 --> 02:10:35,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

1697
02:10:37,006 --> 02:10:42,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it was just, it was bound to happen.

1698
02:10:42,309 --> 02:10:43,590
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they've been losing money.

1699
02:10:44,370 --> 02:10:53,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, especially given, I think, weren't they still the ones who solely owned the Mortal Kombat franchise for a while?

1700
02:10:55,056 --> 02:10:56,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Those games certainly weren't doing much of anything.

1701
02:10:57,530 --> 02:11:01,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sadly, I mean, they had the DC Universe game, but it was... That was crap.

1702
02:11:01,672 --> 02:11:01,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1703
02:11:03,933 --> 02:11:05,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was just inevitable.

1704
02:11:05,434 --> 02:11:07,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Because apparently Blitz League did not pay the bills.

1705
02:11:08,635 --> 02:11:13,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And then their next genius idea, which thankfully never came out, This is Vegas.

1706
02:11:14,338 --> 02:11:17,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the game that simulates going to Vegas.

1707
02:11:18,039 --> 02:11:22,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Partying, driving cars, having sex with women, and gambling.

1708
02:11:24,202 --> 02:11:24,382
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1709
02:11:24,402 --> 02:11:24,482
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1710
02:11:26,657 --> 02:11:53,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, some of the news that came out of August Apparently Wii Sports Resort was the best-selling game of August There you go, Loki, I thought I'd mention that just for you And the PlayStation 3 Slim was unveiled So let's get away from Nintendo for a minute here And talk about maybe the PlayStation 3 Because I think this was probably the smartest thing Sony did all year It was something they should have done a year ago Was drop the price down to $2.99 Yes, they were retarded from the get-go Saying, oh yeah, our system's gonna be $5.99

1711
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:55,799
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1712
02:11:55,819 --> 02:11:56,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you remember that YouTube?

1713
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know we played it on this show like a million times.

1714
02:11:59,181 --> 02:12:07,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the press conference in under a minute that would go $599 US dollars, $599 US dollars, and just like over and over again.

1715
02:12:08,347 --> 02:12:09,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that really was the moment.

1716
02:12:09,867 --> 02:12:12,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody was like so jazzed about the PlayStation 3 and then they're like, it's going to be $599.

1717
02:12:13,169 --> 02:12:19,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's like, I remember us watching that on TV.

1718
02:12:19,053 --> 02:12:21,374
[SPEAKER_03]: We were like, are you fucking kidding me?

1719
02:12:22,114 --> 02:12:22,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Africa.

1720
02:12:24,793 --> 02:12:27,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai Ridge Racer

1721
02:12:52,839 --> 02:12:57,961
[SPEAKER_04]: The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change and the consumers are ready.

1722
02:12:59,201 --> 02:13:03,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.

1723
02:13:03,943 --> 02:13:05,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridge Racer!

1724
02:13:06,204 --> 02:13:15,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.

1725
02:13:15,907 --> 02:13:18,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's this giant enemy crab.

1726
02:13:18,788 --> 02:13:20,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridge Racer!

1727
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:25,142
[SPEAKER_05]: and Mew attack its weak point for massive damage.

1728
02:13:25,423 --> 02:13:26,363
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Ridge Racer.

1729
02:13:27,544 --> 02:13:28,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer.

1730
02:13:29,145 --> 02:13:32,147
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3 will retail for 599 US dollars, 599 US dollars, 599 US dollars.

1731
02:13:32,167 --> 02:13:32,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Giant enemy crab.

1732
02:13:32,507 --> 02:13:33,067
[SPEAKER_04]: 599, 599, 599 US dollars.

1733
02:13:33,087 --> 02:13:33,607
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Ridge Racer.

1734
02:13:45,462 --> 02:13:46,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer!

1735
02:13:47,385 --> 02:13:53,813
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the best thing to come out of the decade by the way in gaming was that little one minute clip from YouTube user Macaw45.

1736
02:13:53,833 --> 02:13:54,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

1737
02:13:59,284 --> 02:14:00,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't they do it sooner, Loki?

1738
02:14:00,665 --> 02:14:04,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't Sony figure out, maybe we should have dropped the price a long time ago?

1739
02:14:05,530 --> 02:14:07,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they just stubborn with the whole blue rate thing?

1740
02:14:07,652 --> 02:14:14,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a matter of if they would have dropped the price sooner, they would have sold more units, but they would have also lost their ass from the cost of the system.

1741
02:14:14,878 --> 02:14:19,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem was just building a system with that much in components in the first place.

1742
02:14:21,537 --> 02:14:31,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's tough to justify, you know, so they end up having to cut some corners and stuff, and once the, you know, prices of the components came down, they could actually justify dropping the price of the system.

1743
02:14:32,222 --> 02:14:35,684
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little late, so they have some catching up to do, but we'll see.

1744
02:14:37,119 --> 02:14:40,623
[SPEAKER_02]: September, some other companies followed along with some price drops.

1745
02:14:40,723 --> 02:14:41,744
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii dropped to $200.

1746
02:14:42,565 --> 02:14:43,667
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened in September.

1747
02:14:44,227 --> 02:14:50,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the information came out about the PSP Go that there would be no conversion that happens.

1748
02:14:50,194 --> 02:14:57,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you own a UMD and you want to upgrade to the PSP Go, you can rebuy your game because of licensing issues.

1749
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:00,691
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing issues.

1750
02:15:01,432 --> 02:15:04,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But wait, the PSP Go wasn't confirmed yet, was it?

1751
02:15:04,815 --> 02:15:06,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I think by September it was.

1752
02:15:06,836 --> 02:15:08,778
[SPEAKER_03]: They showed it at E3, dummy.

1753
02:15:08,818 --> 02:15:09,859
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't at E3.

1754
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:10,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was.

1755
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:12,281
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in that back room, wasn't it?

1756
02:15:12,602 --> 02:15:13,482
[SPEAKER_03]: You were wrong.

1757
02:15:14,263 --> 02:15:16,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have sworn it was there.

1758
02:15:16,465 --> 02:15:18,046
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP Go was shown at Gamescom.

1759
02:15:19,067 --> 02:15:19,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

1760
02:15:20,709 --> 02:15:22,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So by September, Gamescom would happen anyway.

1761
02:15:22,691 --> 02:15:22,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1762
02:15:26,296 --> 02:15:31,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, and then moving on into kind of more recent things that happened to kind of sum up 2009.

1763
02:15:33,379 --> 02:15:40,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when the PSP Go finally did launch in October, that added 100 PSP games to the PlayStation Network.

1764
02:15:42,163 --> 02:15:44,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was really some of the biggest stuff that came out.

1765
02:15:44,164 --> 02:15:46,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, some of the stuff about...

1766
02:15:48,120 --> 02:16:14,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Modern Warfare 2 was coming out pretty soon and some news about the DSi XL although that hasn't come out yet the news the early news that came out in October DSi XL what do you think it's just it's unnecessary I'm really at the point of all of this that I'm like whatever people are gonna buy it whatever I'm not getting one not yet anyway

1767
02:16:16,263 --> 02:16:17,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unnecessary, it really is.

1768
02:16:17,844 --> 02:16:19,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's keep shrinking down the system.

1769
02:16:19,286 --> 02:16:20,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, let's make it bigger.

1770
02:16:20,126 --> 02:16:23,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, put the Game Boy Advance slot back in it then.

1771
02:16:23,889 --> 02:16:24,750
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to make it bigger.

1772
02:16:24,910 --> 02:16:25,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, we can't do that.

1773
02:16:27,733 --> 02:16:28,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1774
02:16:28,733 --> 02:16:29,854
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the point of making the screens bigger?

1775
02:16:30,555 --> 02:16:31,496
[SPEAKER_03]: For old people!

1776
02:16:31,616 --> 02:16:32,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Because bigger's better!

1777
02:16:33,217 --> 02:16:34,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's for old people.

1778
02:16:34,698 --> 02:16:38,341
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember with the Game Boy Advance, smaller was better, hence the micro.

1779
02:16:38,762 --> 02:16:41,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that didn't sell very well, so they must have said, oh never mind, bigger's better!

1780
02:16:42,245 --> 02:16:42,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1781
02:16:42,425 --> 02:16:42,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1782
02:16:43,869 --> 02:16:45,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a spectator system now, remember?

1783
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:48,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people want to watch you play DSi games.

1784
02:16:52,032 --> 02:16:55,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I suggest you put a video out on the system.

1785
02:16:55,874 --> 02:16:56,654
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a thought!

1786
02:16:57,914 --> 02:16:58,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Play it on your TV.

1787
02:16:59,135 --> 02:17:13,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I understand that that wouldn't really make sense, you know, playing a DSi on a TV since it's dual screen, but hey, you could maybe put, you know, split the video signal or something, or you could just put the top screen on there.

1788
02:17:14,884 --> 02:17:15,144
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1789
02:17:15,164 --> 02:17:16,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottom screen, whatever.

1790
02:17:16,545 --> 02:17:19,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Just jamming through the last couple months here because they did just happen.

1791
02:17:19,146 --> 02:17:21,407
[SPEAKER_02]: In November, of course, EA cut 1,500 jobs.

1792
02:17:21,427 --> 02:17:22,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 17% of their games.

1793
02:17:23,168 --> 02:17:24,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Canceled a dozen games.

1794
02:17:25,009 --> 02:17:29,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a good year for EA in that department because that was the second big layoff story we got out of EA in the year.

1795
02:17:30,552 --> 02:17:38,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was also the month where we had a funny story about how World of Warcraft was closed in China for three months, and we kind of joked about what would happen if you couldn't log into World of Warcraft for three months.

1796
02:17:38,777 --> 02:17:41,378
[SPEAKER_02]: There would be some people that just wouldn't know what to do with themselves.

1797
02:17:41,418 --> 02:17:42,699
[SPEAKER_02]: People would go outdoors.

1798
02:17:44,382 --> 02:17:45,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would take all my oxygen.

1799
02:17:46,063 --> 02:17:47,303
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we do about that?

1800
02:17:47,784 --> 02:17:55,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of my favorite rumors that came out in December, that Logitech apparently is making a UMD add-on for the PSP Go.

1801
02:17:55,369 --> 02:17:57,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how ridiculous is that idea?

1802
02:17:58,551 --> 02:18:00,172
[SPEAKER_02]: A, why would that be coming from Logitech?

1803
02:18:00,332 --> 02:18:02,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless I guess they're doing it on behalf of Sony or whatever.

1804
02:18:02,474 --> 02:18:03,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, just what?

1805
02:18:04,675 --> 02:18:05,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dumb.

1806
02:18:05,576 --> 02:18:06,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the point?

1807
02:18:07,197 --> 02:18:08,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you... First off...

1808
02:18:09,258 --> 02:18:10,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you buy that?

1809
02:18:10,759 --> 02:18:18,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why you would even pay the money to buy a UMD add-on for a system that was more expensive than the PSP-3000 in the first place.

1810
02:18:19,565 --> 02:18:25,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And the PSP-3000 has everything that the Go has, with the exception of the Bluetooth, which is fine.

1811
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:30,453
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just don't understand why you would do that.

1812
02:18:31,553 --> 02:18:32,414
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to be pretty dumb.

1813
02:18:33,772 --> 02:18:39,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pull the PSP, go off shells already and cut your losses and make a PSP 2 or something, I don't know.

1814
02:18:39,957 --> 02:18:45,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that does it for kind of like our year little wrap up there, kind of walking down memory lane and some of the stories there.

1815
02:18:45,161 --> 02:18:46,882
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to the decade in a little bit.

1816
02:18:47,303 --> 02:18:57,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kind of just open up the Skype line to kind of talk about the decade and we'll get to that in a minute, but of course we do have some segments we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio and one of them is very important.

1817
02:18:58,171 --> 02:18:58,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our...

1818
02:18:59,332 --> 02:19:27,855
[SPEAKER_02]: moments of angst because there were a lot of stupid people this year and stupid people that robbed things and you know like that guy who stole the Xbox and then played it so they were able to find who they were just a lot of stupidity out there he who shall not be named the lawyer that was disbarred one of my personal highlights of the year 2000 to 2010 and so forth anyhow we're going to call this our FUs of the week but in some regards maybe this is the FUs of the decade I don't know here they are the FUs of the week

1819
02:19:43,415 --> 02:19:53,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually do have an FU of the week, and that just goes to the TSA for putting in stricter ticket rules, I guess, where your name has to fully match.

1820
02:19:54,600 --> 02:20:03,744
[SPEAKER_09]: And my credit card information, you know, when I buy my ticket, it's going to come up under my name as I have it listed for my billing information, which is not exactly how my name shows on my license.

1821
02:20:04,244 --> 02:20:05,045
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, annoying.

1822
02:20:05,505 --> 02:20:06,765
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's about it.

1823
02:20:06,805 --> 02:20:10,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as far as the year, or the decade, I should say,

1824
02:20:11,605 --> 02:20:15,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Um... The... The biggest FU has actually already happened, Rob.

1825
02:20:17,508 --> 02:20:18,788
[SPEAKER_09]: What's-his-fuck-got-disbarred?

1826
02:20:19,768 --> 02:20:23,350
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's not a ginormous FU, I don't know what is.

1827
02:20:25,251 --> 02:20:26,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

1828
02:20:26,131 --> 02:20:28,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what are your FUs of the week and the decade?

1829
02:20:29,452 --> 02:20:31,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... I don't really know.

1830
02:20:32,013 --> 02:20:39,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Guess... FU to... I don't really have anything.

1831
02:20:40,477 --> 02:20:40,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1832
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:45,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I feeded myself for not being able to play a lot of games during the holiday break.

1833
02:20:46,043 --> 02:20:57,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of time I wasted trying to get games for my MAME cabinet, which I should just really play on the MAME cabinet, because I have, what, thousands of games on there already, and I haven't touched most of them.

1834
02:20:57,811 --> 02:21:00,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, why do I need more games?

1835
02:21:00,553 --> 02:21:02,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, because I need more of everything, that's why.

1836
02:21:02,554 --> 02:21:07,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then the FU of the decade goes to, uh...

1837
02:21:10,148 --> 02:21:11,049
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I don't even know.

1838
02:21:11,069 --> 02:21:14,250
[SPEAKER_03]: That's tough to just nail down one thing.

1839
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:21,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess... To Nintendo for disappointing us on a consistent basis.

1840
02:21:22,435 --> 02:21:23,976
[SPEAKER_03]: And goddamn it, Embrace Online!

1841
02:21:26,457 --> 02:21:30,059
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week... I don't know, I'm not super angsty.

1842
02:21:30,099 --> 02:21:34,942
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week goes to... Selfishness.

1843
02:21:36,665 --> 02:21:41,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's some selfish people out there I'm learning about and I don't like it.

1844
02:21:42,706 --> 02:21:47,910
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the decade goes to people that steal things that aren't theirs.

1845
02:21:48,611 --> 02:21:52,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember this decade my car was broken into a multitude of times.

1846
02:21:52,754 --> 02:21:59,200
[SPEAKER_02]: We had these people talking about, you know, stealing Xboxes and so forth that stupidly sign on to them online.

1847
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:02,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Stealing passwords and using them to hack people's account.

1848
02:22:02,943 --> 02:22:07,166
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to people that don't have the common decency to not touch shit that isn't theirs.

1849
02:22:08,647 --> 02:22:09,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and FU to Proposition 8.

1850
02:22:09,888 --> 02:22:10,809
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty fucked up too.

1851
02:22:12,605 --> 02:22:13,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, back to the show.

1852
02:22:13,846 --> 02:22:18,227
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the segment of the show where we open up ye olde mailbag and see what our listeners have to say?

1853
02:22:18,848 --> 02:22:23,310
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be at our mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com address.

1854
02:22:31,193 --> 02:22:32,353
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two emails.

1855
02:22:32,654 --> 02:22:32,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.

1856
02:22:33,494 --> 02:22:38,436
[SPEAKER_09]: First one, hey, OLR, I was in Spanish class a few days ago and thinking about the new year.

1857
02:22:38,876 --> 02:22:40,217
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have been focusing on Spanish.

1858
02:22:41,554 --> 02:22:46,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I started thinking about really crappy games with peripherals that no one will buy like Band Hero and Tony Hawk Ride.

1859
02:22:47,137 --> 02:22:50,540
[SPEAKER_09]: So my question to you is, what are your peripheral predictions for the new year?

1860
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:54,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, mine will be Knife and Fork and stuff like that for a new Cooking Mama game.

1861
02:22:56,303 --> 02:22:57,544
[SPEAKER_03]: They've already done that, actually.

1862
02:22:59,161 --> 02:23:03,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, there's actually a burger flipping ticket game that came out in Japan.

1863
02:23:04,786 --> 02:23:10,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we're going to get Bunga Bunga for the home, and it comes with a real finger-to-butt peripheral.

1864
02:23:10,490 --> 02:23:12,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened to the table flipping game that was out in Japan?

1865
02:23:13,013 --> 02:23:13,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see that out here.

1866
02:23:13,853 --> 02:23:14,234
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out in Japan.

1867
02:23:14,414 --> 02:23:14,994
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

1868
02:23:15,054 --> 02:23:16,175
[SPEAKER_03]: What about here?

1869
02:23:16,195 --> 02:23:21,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if Bunga Bunga is actually, or Bunga Bunga or whatever, is emulated in MAME yet.

1870
02:23:24,090 --> 02:23:24,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get it.

1871
02:23:24,951 --> 02:23:25,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get it, Loki.

1872
02:23:25,771 --> 02:23:26,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get it.

1873
02:23:26,072 --> 02:23:30,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it is, that would be one hell of a fun game to make a peripheral for.

1874
02:23:31,956 --> 02:23:33,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

1875
02:23:34,398 --> 02:23:40,282
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the rest of the email, what I think next year, as far as peripherals go, you already know, it's the motion sensor stuff.

1876
02:23:40,503 --> 02:23:42,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Natal and the ice cream cones from Sony.

1877
02:23:42,964 --> 02:23:45,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are going to be the huge things, game changers, that come out next year.

1878
02:23:45,967 --> 02:23:47,208
[SPEAKER_09]: They're also going to come out with the...

1879
02:23:48,860 --> 02:24:04,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I think not just necessarily something that reads your motion, but also I would actually like to see something that doesn't necessarily view your motion as much as checks your coordination.

1880
02:24:04,774 --> 02:24:05,314
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1881
02:24:06,315 --> 02:24:09,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it gives you something like a full motion sensing DDR.

1882
02:24:10,811 --> 02:24:15,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it gives you your commands and then you have to mimic exactly.

1883
02:24:15,356 --> 02:24:19,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Or even charades online.

1884
02:24:21,122 --> 02:24:21,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you imagine that?

1885
02:24:21,823 --> 02:24:22,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I don't want to see?

1886
02:24:23,104 --> 02:24:23,645
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

1887
02:24:23,685 --> 02:24:25,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that charades online idea.

1888
02:24:25,026 --> 02:24:28,189
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I don't want to see is this whole brain scanning thing.

1889
02:24:28,209 --> 02:24:29,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard about the brain devices?

1890
02:24:29,691 --> 02:24:32,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the game that you control with your brain and all this stuff?

1891
02:24:32,434 --> 02:24:33,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like that idea.

1892
02:24:34,896 --> 02:24:35,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like that at all.

1893
02:24:35,717 --> 02:24:37,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that isn't where peripherals go next year.

1894
02:24:38,959 --> 02:24:41,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the whole thought reading thing.

1895
02:24:41,641 --> 02:24:43,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a little freaky to me.

1896
02:24:44,423 --> 02:24:46,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Call me a warrior or whatever.

1897
02:24:46,484 --> 02:24:48,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little weird.

1898
02:24:49,966 --> 02:24:50,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else in the mail rag?

1899
02:24:51,186 --> 02:24:51,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1900
02:24:51,566 --> 02:24:52,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's still more to that one.

1901
02:24:52,967 --> 02:24:53,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my bad.

1902
02:24:53,887 --> 02:24:55,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Rob.

1903
02:24:56,068 --> 02:24:57,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I have to give you a hard time.

1904
02:24:58,368 --> 02:25:00,589
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as I can find where the crap my thing went to.

1905
02:25:00,649 --> 02:25:01,089
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1906
02:25:02,529 --> 02:25:04,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I wondered where you guys get your news from.

1907
02:25:04,930 --> 02:25:07,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a set or are you all over the place?

1908
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:11,811
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite right now is GamesWithAZTraffic.com.

1909
02:25:11,871 --> 02:25:12,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Look it up.

1910
02:25:12,452 --> 02:25:13,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Mike.

1911
02:25:14,372 --> 02:25:16,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should give somebody a free plug.

1912
02:25:16,773 --> 02:25:17,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

1913
02:25:17,293 --> 02:25:17,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mind.

1914
02:25:18,033 --> 02:25:18,293
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1915
02:25:19,003 --> 02:25:20,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I go to Eurogamer for a lot of my stuff.

1916
02:25:21,487 --> 02:25:21,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1917
02:25:37,093 --> 02:25:38,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, another one.

1918
02:25:38,394 --> 02:25:39,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everyone.

1919
02:25:39,134 --> 02:25:41,154
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from Spasmator, by the way.

1920
02:25:41,775 --> 02:25:42,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everyone.

1921
02:25:42,315 --> 02:25:47,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing as this is topics and questions may possibly run a little long, I opted to send them via email rather than Twitter.

1922
02:25:48,416 --> 02:25:54,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing as it's the end of the year and traditionally everyone seemingly does a top ten list of some sort, why not have OLR and the OLR Army do one?

1923
02:25:55,559 --> 02:25:56,499
[SPEAKER_09]: But do one with a twist.

1924
02:25:56,899 --> 02:26:00,560
[SPEAKER_09]: What I had in mind was a list of top games that came out this year that you

1925
02:26:01,226 --> 02:26:08,807
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd love to have the Hillary Clintons and the Voldemorts of the world be forced to play non-stop for days on end just to drive them all crazy.

1926
02:26:09,127 --> 02:26:10,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, even crazier than they already happen to be.

1927
02:26:11,428 --> 02:26:13,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, seeing as the year is virtually over, I have two questions.

1928
02:26:13,968 --> 02:26:26,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Compared to 2008, how do you feel about 2009 fared in regards to game releases, sales of both consoles and games, as well as improvements to consoles and or their online services, both in terms of actual hardware revisions or...

1929
02:26:27,991 --> 02:26:29,872
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as firmware updates.

1930
02:26:30,432 --> 02:26:31,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no opinion.

1931
02:26:33,294 --> 02:26:34,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about the same.

1932
02:26:34,394 --> 02:26:35,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't pay.

1933
02:26:35,715 --> 02:26:38,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say, I think 09's been a lot more disappointing than 08.

1934
02:26:38,637 --> 02:26:40,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've had a lot of disappointments this year.

1935
02:26:40,358 --> 02:26:44,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Games getting pushed back, quality of games, you know, don't seem to be up there.

1936
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:47,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's lots of exceptions to this rule, don't get me wrong.

1937
02:26:47,481 --> 02:26:53,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there's been some real gems that have been released this year, but I think layoffs, etc., it's been a lot of disappointment this year.

1938
02:26:53,885 --> 02:26:56,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's a lot of good that came out of this year.

1939
02:26:58,274 --> 02:27:02,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for, um, yeah, I got nothing.

1940
02:27:03,498 --> 02:27:04,199
[SPEAKER_02]: President Cat.

1941
02:27:04,219 --> 02:27:04,479
[SPEAKER_02]: President Cat.

1942
02:27:04,499 --> 02:27:06,120
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing that came out this year, that's it.

1943
02:27:06,761 --> 02:27:12,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, two, and as far as 2010 is concerned, is there anything in particular that's been announced that you three are eagerly awaiting?

1944
02:27:12,786 --> 02:27:17,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any possible predictions for 2010, or at least something you hope to see happen?

1945
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:21,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I hope that, um, we get President Cat.

1946
02:27:23,972 --> 02:27:31,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, to kind of piggyback on what Loki was ranting about earlier, I would really like to see Nintendo come out at E3 and do the system they should have done last time.

1947
02:27:32,537 --> 02:27:35,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that, you know, Wii was, you know, their gamble.

1948
02:27:36,079 --> 02:27:37,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay for them, they won.

1949
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:48,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see them kind of take that up to the next level and catch up finally to where their competitors are at as far as the hardcore gamers are concerned, you know, with the HD and the online and all that fun stuff.

1950
02:27:48,426 --> 02:27:51,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to happen, but I'd like, you asked what I want to see.

1951
02:27:52,368 --> 02:27:52,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1952
02:27:55,151 --> 02:27:57,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always a big fan of more retro goodness.

1953
02:27:57,332 --> 02:27:59,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to see more retro games coming back.

1954
02:28:00,352 --> 02:28:04,313
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole achievements and trophies and cooperative online play.

1955
02:28:04,673 --> 02:28:05,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of all that stuff.

1956
02:28:05,993 --> 02:28:14,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish the Virtual Console had achievements within it or ways that I could experience all these old games again with friends.

1957
02:28:15,995 --> 02:28:21,277
[SPEAKER_02]: As neat as Virtual Console is for some of the great retro games, it feels very lazy to me.

1958
02:28:22,097 --> 02:28:23,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an emulator you're paying for.

1959
02:28:26,793 --> 02:28:30,135
[SPEAKER_02]: and, to be fair, Xbox 360 has a lot of these games in their arcade, too.

1960
02:28:30,175 --> 02:28:31,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not just picking on Nintendo here.

1961
02:28:31,876 --> 02:28:41,622
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of arcade releases on 360, and Microsoft finally put their foot down on this, was just retro stuff that would throw in some achievements and, you know, I just, I don't know, I just would like to see retro games respected.

1962
02:28:41,642 --> 02:28:42,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been a decent year for retro gaming.

1963
02:28:43,283 --> 02:28:45,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it has been a decent year, though, for retro gaming already.

1964
02:28:45,705 --> 02:28:48,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because we've gotten certainly a lot of nods.

1965
02:28:48,026 --> 02:28:49,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Bionic Commando and...

1966
02:28:52,329 --> 02:28:54,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I really, though, want to see something really innovative.

1967
02:28:55,071 --> 02:28:56,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see something really original.

1968
02:28:57,834 --> 02:28:59,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see a game.

1969
02:28:59,335 --> 02:29:03,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see working designs come back and bring out all the cool stuff from Japan.

1970
02:29:04,460 --> 02:29:05,020
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want.

1971
02:29:07,202 --> 02:29:07,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm holding my breath.

1972
02:29:11,803 --> 02:29:12,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it for that email?

1973
02:29:12,863 --> 02:29:13,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is there more?

1974
02:29:14,244 --> 02:29:14,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's it.

1975
02:29:15,384 --> 02:29:15,704
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1976
02:29:15,724 --> 02:29:16,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, yeah, that's it.

1977
02:29:16,964 --> 02:29:20,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadar.com is the place to send your emails.

1978
02:29:21,146 --> 02:29:23,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we'll get into the decade a little bit.

1979
02:29:23,726 --> 02:29:33,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to linger too long on this, but it's interesting that we're getting to the close of another decade here, the O's or whatever we're going to end up calling these in the past.

1980
02:29:33,669 --> 02:29:33,989
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1981
02:29:49,716 --> 02:29:51,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Games have kind of evolved with many of you.

1982
02:29:51,937 --> 02:29:53,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, not all of our listeners.

1983
02:29:53,979 --> 02:29:56,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck, the hosts don't fit into that age bracket.

1984
02:29:56,860 --> 02:30:00,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm considerably older than that, you know, as we all are.

1985
02:30:00,142 --> 02:30:03,605
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I realize that that's where a lot of the listener base is.

1986
02:30:04,185 --> 02:30:06,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And just how much games have changed.

1987
02:30:06,206 --> 02:30:08,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to kind of rewind 10 years and show you how far we've come.

1988
02:30:08,888 --> 02:30:12,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are some of the big things that happened in the year 2000.

1989
02:30:14,251 --> 02:30:16,653
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2 was launched.

1990
02:30:17,253 --> 02:30:21,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo finally sold its 100 millionth Game Boy handheld console.

1991
02:30:30,743 --> 02:30:37,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega launched SegaNet into the year 2000, and that's when the Dreamcast Championships took off.

1992
02:30:38,607 --> 02:30:40,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the games that came out in the year 2000.

1993
02:30:40,248 --> 02:30:44,110
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sims came out January 31st of the year 2000.

1994
02:30:44,170 --> 02:30:44,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That it did.

1995
02:30:44,590 --> 02:30:46,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was almost 10 years old.

1996
02:30:46,491 --> 02:30:47,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Thief 2 came out in the year 2000.

1997
02:30:49,454 --> 02:31:12,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Vagrant Story, EverQuest came out in the year 2000, Deuce X, Diablo 2 was from the year 2000, that game feels even older, Final Fantasy 9 had a release in Japan in the year 2000, Chrono Cross came out in 2000, Dragon Quest 7, American McGee's Alice,

1998
02:31:13,936 --> 02:31:17,098
[SPEAKER_02]: The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask was in the year 2000.

1999
02:31:17,198 --> 02:31:20,561
[SPEAKER_09]: What else we also had that year?

2000
02:31:21,361 --> 02:31:21,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Seaman.

2001
02:31:22,662 --> 02:31:23,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that, really?

2002
02:31:23,643 --> 02:31:25,124
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not on this list, but probably.

2003
02:31:25,665 --> 02:31:27,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Seaman, did they have a lot of Dreamcast stuff on there?

2004
02:31:29,607 --> 02:31:31,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they account for Dreamcast on this list.

2005
02:31:32,262 --> 02:31:36,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, no, Seaman might have either been 2000 or 2001.

2006
02:31:37,326 --> 02:31:39,989
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the Dreamcast stuff was all early.

2007
02:31:40,509 --> 02:31:53,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Escape from Monkey Island, Tekken Tag Tournament, Final Fantasy 9 got its release over here too, Skies of Arcadia, Banjo-Tooie, here's some Dreamcasts, Grandia 2 came out towards the end of the year 2000.

2008
02:31:54,861 --> 02:31:55,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Grandia 2, Power Stone

2009
02:32:17,420 --> 02:32:24,745
[SPEAKER_02]: and a completely different generation of video games because the launch of the new generation, if you will, of games didn't really happen until, what about 2005, 2006?

2010
02:32:25,286 --> 02:32:29,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I think E3 is when we started hearing about this new round of consoles.

2011
02:32:30,169 --> 02:32:34,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go back, I mean, heck, the GameCube just came out in what, like 01?

2012
02:32:34,612 --> 02:32:35,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have the Wii.

2013
02:32:36,253 --> 02:32:39,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've gone through many, many different game systems in this generation.

2014
02:32:39,835 --> 02:32:45,259
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would have had that all touched this last 10 years we had the Dreamcast,

2015
02:32:46,072 --> 02:32:50,894
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3, the GameCube, the Wii, the Xbox.

2016
02:32:51,094 --> 02:32:54,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft got into gaming in these past few years, or not even 10 years ago.

2017
02:32:55,555 --> 02:32:56,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Xbox 360.

2018
02:32:57,216 --> 02:33:03,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, I'm not even counting handhelds and the countless amounts of those and other one-off systems that came out as well.

2019
02:33:03,978 --> 02:33:08,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be interesting in the next 10 years, in the next generation, just how far games...

2020
02:33:09,620 --> 02:33:11,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Go will probably be another generation.

2021
02:33:11,221 --> 02:33:17,667
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be talking about the PlayStation 4 and other Xboxes and maybe other companies that decide to get into gaming.

2022
02:33:18,227 --> 02:33:20,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe one of these companies will buy another.

2023
02:33:20,589 --> 02:33:21,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

2024
02:33:21,210 --> 02:33:22,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very interesting to see what happens.

2025
02:33:23,632 --> 02:33:28,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we open up the phone calls, and yes, some folks in chat want to point out, OLR started in 2002.

2026
02:33:29,597 --> 02:33:34,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we didn't exist 10 years ago, we're getting into our 8th year of broadcasting.

2027
02:33:35,242 --> 02:33:36,243
[SPEAKER_02]: That's quite some time.

2028
02:33:36,283 --> 02:33:37,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty impressive.

2029
02:33:39,232 --> 02:33:40,052
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

2030
02:33:40,072 --> 02:33:41,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this is a very difficult question.

2031
02:33:41,993 --> 02:33:43,374
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very difficult question.

2032
02:33:43,834 --> 02:33:48,356
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you guys think were some of the best games to come out of the decade?

2033
02:33:48,917 --> 02:33:54,479
[SPEAKER_02]: The best games to come out of all freaking decade, knowing that you have all of those systems available to you.

2034
02:33:55,020 --> 02:33:59,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just maybe what was important to you, but what you think was important to gaming in general.

2035
02:34:00,542 --> 02:34:01,082
[SPEAKER_02]: The decade.

2036
02:34:02,183 --> 02:34:03,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, want to start?

2037
02:34:03,184 --> 02:34:03,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything?

2038
02:34:06,005 --> 02:34:06,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

2039
02:34:08,171 --> 02:34:10,892
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Max 2 in the arcade.

2040
02:34:11,633 --> 02:34:11,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?

2041
02:34:12,793 --> 02:34:13,334
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

2042
02:34:13,794 --> 02:34:17,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It got people back in the arcade because you had stuff that you were working to unlock.

2043
02:34:18,636 --> 02:34:18,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2044
02:34:19,377 --> 02:34:20,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Fifth Mix too.

2045
02:34:20,597 --> 02:34:23,479
[SPEAKER_02]: That came out around the same time.

2046
02:34:23,499 --> 02:34:25,140
[SPEAKER_02]: These were also games that brought us together.

2047
02:34:25,220 --> 02:34:26,360
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't have OL Army.

2048
02:34:26,540 --> 02:34:30,823
[SPEAKER_02]: As much shit as we give Konami and their music division now, ten years ago was a different story.

2049
02:34:31,043 --> 02:34:32,343
[SPEAKER_02]: We praise them.

2050
02:34:32,384 --> 02:34:32,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We love them.

2051
02:34:33,604 --> 02:34:35,005
[SPEAKER_02]: But they made a lot of mistakes, sadly.

2052
02:34:36,587 --> 02:34:37,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto 3

2053
02:35:00,129 --> 02:35:02,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel vs. Capcom 2 Final Fantasy X Final Fantasy X

2054
02:35:28,857 --> 02:35:29,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Only MMO.

2055
02:35:29,538 --> 02:35:33,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I played a little Matrix Online, but that sucked.

2056
02:35:35,423 --> 02:35:36,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, yeah, it's tough.

2057
02:35:39,006 --> 02:35:43,130
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, anything you want to throw out there as far as your games of the decade?

2058
02:35:43,490 --> 02:35:43,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Portal.

2059
02:35:44,791 --> 02:35:45,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely Portal.

2060
02:35:47,273 --> 02:35:47,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Seaman.

2061
02:35:49,155 --> 02:35:49,695
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR.

2062
02:35:50,596 --> 02:35:54,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, keep in mind, I got DDR for home in 2000 on Dreamcast.

2063
02:35:57,982 --> 02:35:58,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Rod Calibur, Rob.

2064
02:35:59,843 --> 02:36:01,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Rod Calibur is important.

2065
02:36:01,484 --> 02:36:03,866
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember Rod Calibur, don't you?

2066
02:36:03,926 --> 02:36:05,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's when you play Soul Calibur with the Rod.

2067
02:36:06,028 --> 02:36:06,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

2068
02:36:07,288 --> 02:36:07,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Rod Calibur.

2069
02:36:10,191 --> 02:36:23,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I'd have to say, probably as far as shooters go, I'd say Ikaruga, getting Gradius V. There was a lot of good games that came out, though, in the decade.

2070
02:36:25,723 --> 02:36:32,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, but I'd really say, well, if I say Portal, I should say Narbacular Drop, because that's really the game that gave us Portal.

2071
02:36:32,844 --> 02:36:44,447
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people thinking in interesting directions, especially with having the Dreamcast come out, the Naomi system, the Hikaru after that, although I still want Planet Harrier, where is it?

2072
02:36:45,927 --> 02:36:49,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work, I tried it during the beginning of the show.

2073
02:36:49,128 --> 02:36:49,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn!

2074
02:36:49,808 --> 02:36:51,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it still doesn't work in MAME.

2075
02:36:53,463 --> 02:36:59,666
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as my answer to the question, I've answered this on another show, but to kind of repeat it here on Orange Lounge Radio, I think I would split it up into a few categories.

2076
02:37:01,006 --> 02:37:02,387
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you left yourself on.

2077
02:37:03,067 --> 02:37:03,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

2078
02:37:04,968 --> 02:37:07,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's trying to have a sidebar conversation with me while I'm trying to talk on the internet.

2079
02:37:08,330 --> 02:37:09,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, what was I going to say?

2080
02:37:09,910 --> 02:37:11,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, the game of the decade.

2081
02:37:11,791 --> 02:37:12,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things that came up.

2082
02:37:15,643 --> 02:37:20,966
[SPEAKER_02]: My personal favorite game of the decade I think was probably Animal Crossing was one I really remember.

2083
02:37:21,046 --> 02:37:34,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved how you, you know, as much slack as that game got for running around doing nothing, if you really went far with it where you could like go into somebody else's village, you know, you brought your friend over with a memory card.

2084
02:37:34,234 --> 02:37:40,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember we used to do this shit all the time is that somebody would come over and we'd visit the town and try to get their townspeople to say dirty words and all this stuff.

2085
02:37:41,198 --> 02:37:42,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a lot of fun.

2086
02:37:42,359 --> 02:37:47,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the fact that it had all the retro Nintendo games in it before Nintendo started gouging the prices for all this stuff.

2087
02:37:48,001 --> 02:37:50,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I just loved that game when it first came out.

2088
02:37:50,302 --> 02:37:54,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of sucks that the game's franchise has been milked through the DS and the Wii versions.

2089
02:37:54,924 --> 02:37:56,845
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not really as fun anymore as it used to be.

2090
02:37:57,145 --> 02:38:05,529
[SPEAKER_02]: But that very first Animal Crossing that was on the GameCube in America... Yes, I realize it's based off a Nintendo 64 game, but I'm not counting that because that didn't have an impact on our culture here in the U.S.

2091
02:38:06,049 --> 02:38:08,871
[SPEAKER_02]: That first Animal Crossing on the GameCube I think was probably...

2092
02:38:09,531 --> 02:38:11,433
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best gaming experiences I had all decade.

2093
02:38:13,535 --> 02:38:22,563
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as on a technical level, I know Loki's going to hate me for this, but I think Wii Sports, you have to recognize, is one of the best games of the decade because it got people to play games who don't play games.

2094
02:38:24,065 --> 02:38:26,607
[SPEAKER_02]: You see Wii Sports in nursing homes, for Christ's sake.

2095
02:38:26,647 --> 02:38:28,729
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't want those people playing games!

2096
02:38:29,730 --> 02:38:34,975
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have to recognize, though, that's still money in the gaming industry that can someday make a game you might want to play.

2097
02:38:36,058 --> 02:38:41,579
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it won't, because they'll be catering to these people that don't really care about games, but they like Wii Sports.

2098
02:38:41,639 --> 02:38:42,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, hold on.

2099
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:51,662
[SPEAKER_02]: But without Wii Sports, and basically the Wii in general, would we have Project Natal and the Sony Ice Cream Cones, which may bring us the games you want to play, Loki?

2100
02:38:52,922 --> 02:38:55,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still skeptical on what they're going to bring us.

2101
02:38:55,183 --> 02:38:59,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm skeptical too, but there is a possibility it could be pretty fucking awesome.

2102
02:39:00,302 --> 02:39:00,802
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft

2103
02:39:13,496 --> 02:39:14,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Haters gonna hate.

2104
02:39:14,357 --> 02:39:20,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of people that are anti-MMOs out there, but I think World of Warcraft did amazing stuff for online games.

2105
02:39:20,685 --> 02:39:28,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the way Blizzard kind of caters to the different audiences, Blizzard is like the best PC game maker.

2106
02:39:28,815 --> 02:39:31,218
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.

2107
02:39:31,878 --> 02:39:33,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Name a bad Blizzard game.

2108
02:39:37,009 --> 02:39:37,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Chirp!

2109
02:40:02,408 --> 02:40:02,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Mario Galaxy

2110
02:40:29,141 --> 02:40:32,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying Super Mario Galaxy 2 is not going to be that great.

2111
02:40:36,501 --> 02:41:02,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 9, Half-Life 2 Definitely I think sometimes a forgotten about game from all of us console hoarding folks but the Orange Box did bring this back to the forefront Half-Life 2 was a hugely important PC game just for the way it integrated story into the shooter game and the graphical level and just the fact that the game you didn't really go from level to level, you were immersed

2112
02:41:02,984 --> 02:41:03,324
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

2113
02:41:18,692 --> 02:41:19,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

2114
02:41:37,288 --> 02:41:38,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this entry.

2115
02:41:38,349 --> 02:41:39,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is often overlooked.

2116
02:41:39,849 --> 02:41:41,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 7, Bejeweled from the year 2001.

2117
02:41:42,390 --> 02:41:43,431
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Bejeweled.

2118
02:41:43,911 --> 02:41:44,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see that.

2119
02:41:44,611 --> 02:41:45,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I can totally see that too.

2120
02:41:45,752 --> 02:41:51,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of folks forget what PopCap and casual gaming has done for gaming in this decade.

2121
02:41:51,054 --> 02:41:52,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a very important game to note.

2122
02:41:53,775 --> 02:41:55,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 6, they put Wii Sports.

2123
02:41:55,876 --> 02:41:57,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I need to say anything else with that.

2124
02:41:57,977 --> 02:41:59,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 5, they put Halo.

2125
02:42:01,129 --> 02:42:03,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the Xbox would have survived if it wasn't for Halo.

2126
02:42:04,211 --> 02:42:07,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'd be looking at the Xbox kind of like we look at the Atari Jaguar, honestly.

2127
02:42:08,072 --> 02:42:15,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Xbox kind of pushed, and especially Halo 2, kind of pushed the Xbox to what ended up happening on the 360.

2128
02:42:16,357 --> 02:42:17,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Halo was huge.

2129
02:42:21,139 --> 02:42:24,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly Yahoo and their video game related site does too.

2130
02:42:24,280 --> 02:42:27,922
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Rob, it's all about Pet Society and Farmville.

2131
02:42:28,403 --> 02:42:28,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2132
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:33,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Number four was Guitar Hero, they put on the list.

2133
02:42:33,738 --> 02:42:48,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very interesting, having done this as a music game based show, when it was a very niche thing, it's very interesting that we have kind of watched music games explode into the mainstream, and a lot of this is because of Guitar Hero.

2134
02:42:48,725 --> 02:42:50,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And they finally did what...

2135
02:42:50,526 --> 02:43:03,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami should have thought to do a long fucking time ago or excuse me well Konami of Japan should have taken a risk on a long time ago and stopped being so bullheaded when it comes to releasing stuff in the US and that is put in the songs that people in the US want to play

2136
02:43:04,091 --> 02:43:11,214
[SPEAKER_02]: and granted, I know those of us here in studio and a lot of our long time listeners were fans of stuff that Konami was putting in those music games a long time ago.

2137
02:43:11,594 --> 02:43:15,075
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were a niche audience and those games were never going to break through.

2138
02:43:15,115 --> 02:43:18,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero finally broke it through and I think that's important to note.

2139
02:43:18,277 --> 02:43:19,917
[SPEAKER_09]: And it debuted in our living room.

2140
02:43:20,218 --> 02:43:20,838
[SPEAKER_09]: In my living room.

2141
02:43:21,478 --> 02:43:22,058
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2142
02:43:22,138 --> 02:43:23,879
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys had like a sneak peek.

2143
02:43:23,899 --> 02:43:28,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't here that day but you and Loki were on the news doing some sneak peek thing with Guitar Hero.

2144
02:43:28,361 --> 02:43:28,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

2145
02:43:28,941 --> 02:43:29,541
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty fun.

2146
02:43:29,821 --> 02:43:33,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because I happen to have a big TV that wouldn't you know

2147
02:43:35,324 --> 02:43:36,606
[SPEAKER_09]: had a better refresh rate.

2148
02:43:37,306 --> 02:43:41,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to point out a lot of our chatters, because I'm kind of keeping one eye on chat.orangelongerator.com.

2149
02:43:42,491 --> 02:43:43,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Some interesting comments.

2150
02:43:43,292 --> 02:43:46,455
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru, Half-Life 2 also introduced Steam onto the world.

2151
02:43:46,835 --> 02:43:48,296
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first one that had Steam in it.

2152
02:43:48,877 --> 02:43:52,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And then quite a few folks yelling out, Pagle, better than Bejeweled.

2153
02:43:53,533 --> 02:43:54,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Peggle.

2154
02:43:54,354 --> 02:43:55,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love Peggle too.

2155
02:43:55,194 --> 02:43:56,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially on iPhone.

2156
02:43:56,215 --> 02:43:58,056
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think without Bejeweled, you wouldn't have Peggle.

2157
02:43:58,637 --> 02:44:00,558
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see why they opted to put Peggle on the list.

2158
02:44:00,578 --> 02:44:07,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, shoot, without Tetris or Puzzle Bobble, without Plinko, we wouldn't have Peggle.

2159
02:44:08,303 --> 02:44:13,647
[SPEAKER_02]: The number three game on Yahoo's list, The Sims, was the most important game of the decade.

2160
02:44:13,687 --> 02:44:14,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

2161
02:44:14,368 --> 02:44:16,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I think The Sims was pretty fucking awesome.

2162
02:44:16,089 --> 02:44:18,351
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best PC-selling game for a long time.

2163
02:44:19,412 --> 02:44:20,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Modern Warfare 2 I got nothing

2164
02:44:43,988 --> 02:44:46,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto 3 was really the first sandbox-y type of game like that, right?

2165
02:44:46,750 --> 02:44:49,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And just opened up this whole new type of video game, practically.

2166
02:45:04,587 --> 02:45:11,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, usually I look at those lists and roll my eyes, but maybe with the exception of Wii Fit, that was a pretty good list, I gotta say.

2167
02:45:11,770 --> 02:45:14,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So, see what you guys think about there.

2168
02:45:14,972 --> 02:45:16,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our folks in chat disagree.

2169
02:45:16,593 --> 02:45:23,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know though, I realize Grand Theft Auto 3 might not be the type of game you play, but think about that whole sandbox type of game.

2170
02:45:23,356 --> 02:45:28,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Grand Theft Auto was really kind of the pioneer in that, and I think without Grand Theft Auto 3, you wouldn't have that.

2171
02:45:29,813 --> 02:45:36,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and open up our Skype line and see what you guys have to say about the year in gaming and the decade in gaming.

2172
02:45:36,397 --> 02:45:38,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, it's just an open forum tonight.

2173
02:45:38,118 --> 02:45:44,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you guys want to talk about, it's our last show of the decade, so please give us a call.

2174
02:45:44,341 --> 02:45:53,966
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or you can always reach us on Skype at username OrangeLoungeRadio is the place to call.

2175
02:45:54,906 --> 02:45:58,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls to come in, do we have any last minute stories, Loki?

2176
02:45:59,631 --> 02:46:01,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been looking at last minute stories.

2177
02:46:02,913 --> 02:46:03,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure we do have some.

2178
02:46:04,014 --> 02:46:06,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh good, you're saved because we have a call coming in right now.

2179
02:46:06,435 --> 02:46:07,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and take this call.

2180
02:46:08,156 --> 02:46:09,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2181
02:46:09,417 --> 02:46:09,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2182
02:46:11,038 --> 02:46:12,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Actdeft.

2183
02:46:12,278 --> 02:46:12,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Actdeft.

2184
02:46:12,879 --> 02:46:13,339
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

2185
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:15,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.

2186
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:19,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're talking about, of course, the year in games, the decade in games, or really whatever you want to talk about tonight.

2187
02:46:19,843 --> 02:46:20,283
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2188
02:46:21,618 --> 02:46:28,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, a late Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.

2189
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:29,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Same to you.

2190
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:30,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

2191
02:46:31,501 --> 02:46:33,921
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to talk about my game of the year.

2192
02:46:34,502 --> 02:46:35,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is?

2193
02:46:36,702 --> 02:46:37,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Forza Motorsport 3.

2194
02:46:39,383 --> 02:46:40,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.

2195
02:46:40,143 --> 02:46:44,344
[SPEAKER_02]: That hasn't been mentioned yet on the show, but I can see that as somebody's choice.

2196
02:46:44,704 --> 02:46:46,725
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about this game that makes it the game of the year for you?

2197
02:46:49,922 --> 02:46:51,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I can explain in only one phrase.

2198
02:46:51,705 --> 02:46:54,129
[SPEAKER_01]: It's racing simulation for dummies.

2199
02:46:56,332 --> 02:46:58,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And why does that make it game of the year?

2200
02:46:58,817 --> 02:47:01,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Mario Kart Wii is kind of racing simulation for dummies, right?

2201
02:47:03,243 --> 02:47:17,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Mario Kart Wii is more like an arcade style of racing, while Forza is more of a simulation like Gran Turismo, where if you make a bad turn, you will crash.

2202
02:47:18,491 --> 02:47:23,034
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go too fast, you'll crash, and if you do everything wrong, you'll crash.

2203
02:47:23,794 --> 02:47:30,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And not like in Gran Turismo or any other racing game,

2204
02:47:32,680 --> 02:47:40,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Your car has damages and possibly, well, not possibly, and it will affect your racing.

2205
02:47:43,543 --> 02:47:51,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just the realism in that regard that makes this the game of the year for you or is it like a graphical achievement or what is it that just makes this game so awesome?

2206
02:47:52,873 --> 02:47:54,154
[SPEAKER_01]: and many more.

2207
02:48:13,993 --> 02:48:23,098
[SPEAKER_01]: in tuning, you can paint it, you can make the stickers or the calls, and make your own car.

2208
02:48:23,419 --> 02:48:28,501
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the teddy bear workshop, but in car form.

2209
02:48:29,082 --> 02:48:41,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, it's a pretty easy game to pick up, because the options let you begin to play, you have a lot of things that help you

2210
02:48:42,009 --> 02:48:49,152
[SPEAKER_01]: to race along and complete the challenges and all the tournaments and races you have to compete in.

2211
02:48:49,832 --> 02:48:59,356
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're truly a racing expert, it also has all that other stuff that makes you like the game.

2212
02:49:00,456 --> 02:49:02,257
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a real simulation.

2213
02:49:03,973 --> 02:49:07,917
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, the only criteria that you really have to use is the type of game that you enjoy.

2214
02:49:08,017 --> 02:49:09,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just your criteria and no one else's.

2215
02:49:09,618 --> 02:49:12,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's your game of the year, then so be it.

2216
02:49:12,541 --> 02:49:14,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we appreciate the call and you chiming in on your game of the year.

2217
02:49:14,963 --> 02:49:16,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other quick thoughts you have for us tonight?

2218
02:49:18,126 --> 02:49:25,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, other than that, I think that also Street Fighter IV is also a candidate for game of the year.

2219
02:49:25,914 --> 02:49:27,876
[SPEAKER_01]: A game that offers a studio name, yeah.

2220
02:49:29,441 --> 02:49:30,622
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you say it?

2221
02:49:30,882 --> 02:49:32,863
[SPEAKER_01]: The rebirth of fighting games.

2222
02:49:34,304 --> 02:49:37,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely did energize fighting games in kind of a new way this year.

2223
02:49:37,805 --> 02:49:43,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting, having played Tekken 6 this week, I feel like Street Fighter 4 did inspire some things in it.

2224
02:49:43,468 --> 02:49:43,808
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2225
02:49:44,069 --> 02:49:44,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2226
02:49:45,189 --> 02:49:46,810
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, thank you so much, Actdeft, for the call.

2227
02:49:46,850 --> 02:49:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a great new year, and be safe, okay?

2228
02:49:49,491 --> 02:49:50,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, you too.

2229
02:49:50,192 --> 02:49:50,712
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, later.

2230
02:49:51,620 --> 02:50:15,993
[SPEAKER_02]: again if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio we are open and taking some calls and I know the call the phones have been ringing so we're going to wait here and try to get a call when it comes through of course now that I say that nobody's calling in it's like everybody's waiting because they still hear Actdeft on the line oh we got another call coming in hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

2231
02:50:16,960 --> 02:50:19,681
[SPEAKER_07]: This is that one across the ocean, Akiripper.

2232
02:50:19,941 --> 02:50:21,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Akiripper!

2233
02:50:21,521 --> 02:50:22,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So good to hear from you.

2234
02:50:22,482 --> 02:50:23,742
[SPEAKER_02]: How are things in your neck of the woods?

2235
02:50:24,822 --> 02:50:25,643
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

2236
02:50:25,963 --> 02:50:26,903
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quite fun.

2237
02:50:27,243 --> 02:50:30,244
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, like, mostly fun.

2238
02:50:30,264 --> 02:50:32,505
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, like, what is it?

2239
02:50:32,565 --> 02:50:35,426
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, like, a few feet of snow.

2240
02:50:37,126 --> 02:50:39,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have, like, well, what is it?

2241
02:50:39,807 --> 02:50:46,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, 20 minus degrees Celsius for a night, like, around minus something to something degrees.

2242
02:50:48,030 --> 02:50:49,832
[SPEAKER_07]: and, well, yay.

2243
02:51:18,449 --> 02:51:25,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Game of the year is Sims 3, judging by the amounts that I've played it.

2244
02:51:25,854 --> 02:51:27,695
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes Sims 3 your game of the year?

2245
02:51:27,735 --> 02:51:32,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure DarkSakura wouldn't argue with that, but what was it for you that made that game for you?

2246
02:51:34,259 --> 02:51:38,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm new to this whole Sims game, so to say.

2247
02:51:39,083 --> 02:51:45,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Sims 3 was the first Sims game that I really got addicted to.

2248
02:51:46,358 --> 02:51:54,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Add to the following fact that I haven't played WoW in almost a year now.

2249
02:51:55,245 --> 02:52:00,048
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, there is that.

2250
02:52:00,749 --> 02:52:08,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there is the following fact that my computers tend to explode every new MMO release.

2251
02:52:09,036 --> 02:52:12,759
[SPEAKER_07]: It happened with Warhammer last year, and it happened with Aeon.

2252
02:52:15,101 --> 02:52:23,925
[SPEAKER_07]: and, well, once I get to fix my computers, I have no desire to play any of those MMOs, unfortunately.

2253
02:52:25,045 --> 02:52:25,745
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think it is?

2254
02:52:26,166 --> 02:52:35,509
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we heard a lot this year about ION possibly being the first game that's finally going to really challenge WoW, and then all of a sudden it kind of landed with this big, you know, like it just landed with a thud.

2255
02:52:35,889 --> 02:52:39,731
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, why is it that no MMO can take on WoW, you think?

2256
02:52:42,057 --> 02:52:56,045
[SPEAKER_07]: In my case, I don't know, since, well, as I said, my computer tends to just die a few weeks after it's been released, or the first week it is released.

2257
02:52:57,326 --> 02:53:06,711
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, there seems to be this unlucky... I have this sudden streak of unluck, and it's quite annoying.

2258
02:53:06,731 --> 02:53:07,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well.

2259
02:53:10,974 --> 02:53:16,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Other mentions, well, on Game of the Year.

2260
02:53:17,537 --> 02:53:20,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadow Complex and Dragon Age Origins.

2261
02:53:22,139 --> 02:53:34,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though, Dragon Age Origins, as been said before, because of the only games I play is mostly like The Sims 3,

2262
02:53:37,205 --> 02:53:42,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can't play, haven't played since Dragon Age Origins that much.

2263
02:53:42,927 --> 02:53:47,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a game that wasn't really mentioned before as a possible Game of the Year contender, and I think definitely a lot of big, big fans of that game, so...

2264
02:54:06,887 --> 02:54:17,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, other than that, well, other than that, well, on the personal playing, well, this year I actually got a 360, so, well, yay on me.

2265
02:54:18,814 --> 02:54:19,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposedly so.

2266
02:54:19,875 --> 02:54:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people joined in the Xbox 360 Club and the PS3 Club this year, too, with the Slim.

2267
02:54:24,857 --> 02:54:30,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Akira Ripper, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call and getting in tonight, all right?

2268
02:54:30,781 --> 02:54:31,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, later.

2269
02:54:31,942 --> 02:54:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good new year.

2270
02:54:34,482 --> 02:54:35,403
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2271
02:55:01,471 --> 02:55:04,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Game of the Year Game of the Decade

2272
02:55:21,664 --> 02:55:25,027
[SPEAKER_00]: My game of the year definitely was Beatles Rock Band.

2273
02:55:27,049 --> 02:55:33,435
[SPEAKER_00]: As DarkSakura knows, because she was at my house visiting in the summer, I am a very, very, very big Beatles fan.

2274
02:55:33,455 --> 02:55:45,246
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was nice to get a rock band game that had a lot of songs that I know, as opposed to most of them where I don't know a lot of the songs because I'm an old fart and I only listen to oldies music.

2275
02:55:46,479 --> 02:55:46,999
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2276
02:56:10,871 --> 02:56:14,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It was put together beautifully, too, I think is one of the great things about it.

2277
02:56:14,653 --> 02:56:16,734
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just visually, it's a cool game.

2278
02:56:17,055 --> 02:56:18,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that bass was awesome.

2279
02:56:19,176 --> 02:56:29,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really great, and I still like every time that I play through the game and I play the end, there's like one part where Paul starts to sing end in the end, and I'm like, I love you, Paul!

2280
02:56:29,802 --> 02:56:30,743
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so great!

2281
02:56:32,045 --> 02:56:32,385
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

2282
02:56:47,785 --> 02:56:52,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Game of the Decade Game of the Decade Game of the Decade Game of the Decade Game of the Decade

2283
02:57:15,042 --> 02:57:17,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Game of the Decade was kind of more difficult.

2284
02:57:17,803 --> 02:57:23,504
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to go with something that came out actually at the beginning of the decade, and that was Diablo 2.

2285
02:57:25,045 --> 02:57:26,885
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned that in our 2000 list, yeah?

2286
02:57:27,425 --> 02:57:39,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think Diablo 2 definitely paved the way for a lot of the kind of games that we enjoy now, like World of Warcraft, Warcraft 3, things like that.

2287
02:57:40,168 --> 02:57:43,029
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just overall a really good game, and

2288
02:57:44,585 --> 02:57:45,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I still play that.

2289
02:57:45,326 --> 02:57:47,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's still a lot of people playing that.

2290
02:57:47,567 --> 02:57:48,608
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still no Diablo 3.

2291
02:57:48,948 --> 02:57:50,549
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot of people playing Diablo 2.

2292
02:57:50,809 --> 02:57:56,112
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's funny you kind of say that Diablo 2 paved the way for games like WoW because I really do agree.

2293
02:57:56,472 --> 02:58:03,195
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I used to kind of joke in World of Warcraft that it really should have just been called World of Diablo because that's kind of how it plays.

2294
02:58:04,176 --> 02:58:06,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays a little more like Diablo than it is Warcraft.

2295
02:58:08,174 --> 02:58:24,987
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah so I mean that was you know like there's so many great games that came out this decade but I think Diablo 2 really paved the way for a lot of other games and it was just overall really you know a good game like I said I still play it so you know if it's a game that you can play 10 years later then that's something worthwhile.

2296
02:58:25,752 --> 02:58:28,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a darn good pick, so I'm not going to argue with you there.

2297
02:58:29,633 --> 02:58:33,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe even though I picked something different, I can certainly see where Diablo 2, without that, we would not have had WoW.

2298
02:58:34,355 --> 02:58:35,935
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very good pick.

2299
02:58:36,075 --> 02:58:40,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And Battle.net and this whole infrastructure they had to build for that, too.

2300
02:58:40,296 --> 02:58:42,317
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that's continuing to evolve for them.

2301
02:58:43,857 --> 02:58:46,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight before we get to some more calls?

2302
02:58:47,227 --> 02:58:47,627
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's it.

2303
02:58:47,647 --> 02:58:52,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys are ringing off the hook because I've tried calling in a few times before I got through.

2304
02:58:52,350 --> 02:58:53,791
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go ahead and let you go.

2305
02:58:54,192 --> 02:58:56,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice chatting with you guys again.

2306
02:58:56,533 --> 02:58:56,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2307
02:58:56,873 --> 02:58:58,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very good to chat with you too.

2308
02:58:58,194 --> 02:59:00,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I think though that we should take this opportunity though for a plug.

2309
02:59:00,985 --> 02:59:01,485
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2310
02:59:26,802 --> 02:59:28,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So something's going on.

2311
02:59:28,248 --> 02:59:29,674
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm joking, obviously.

2312
02:59:29,734 --> 02:59:31,040
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's going on, you guys?

2313
02:59:32,432 --> 02:59:43,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've had our long-running segment of my blog, which is Monday's Comic Mania, and it's just where DarkSakura and I kind of blog about upcoming comics in the week.

2314
02:59:43,961 --> 02:59:52,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided, like last week when I was there, to just kind of play around with the idea of doing a podcast of it, and we got a lot of positive feedback.

2315
02:59:52,527 --> 02:59:59,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are starting to do that on a regular basis, and we actually did record our second episode today.

2316
02:59:59,152 --> 02:59:59,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2317
03:00:01,232 --> 03:00:02,293
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty fun too.

2318
03:00:02,994 --> 03:00:05,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So where can they download the podcast if they want to check that out?

2319
03:00:05,918 --> 03:00:08,862
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to check that out, they can go to AvengersTower.com.

2320
03:00:10,598 --> 03:00:11,398
[SPEAKER_02]: An Affiliate Program

2321
03:00:33,769 --> 03:00:34,530
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2322
03:00:50,276 --> 03:00:52,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, you want me to do it after the show tonight.

2323
03:00:52,217 --> 03:00:53,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be happy to do that for you tonight.

2324
03:00:53,437 --> 03:00:53,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

2325
03:00:54,218 --> 03:00:55,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, guys.

2326
03:00:55,178 --> 03:00:55,738
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

2327
03:00:56,219 --> 03:01:00,581
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ToaGak in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com, wants us to fight over Dark Sakura.

2328
03:01:00,981 --> 03:01:07,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will have to settle this in a battle of strip poker, clearly, is the only possible answer.

2329
03:01:07,684 --> 03:01:10,825
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, we'll make it a date next time that I'm up in Sacramento.

2330
03:01:10,845 --> 03:01:12,586
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be one hot date, yeah.

2331
03:01:13,206 --> 03:01:13,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

2332
03:01:14,067 --> 03:01:15,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, it will not be broadcast on the internet.

2333
03:01:16,028 --> 03:01:16,249
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2334
03:01:16,589 --> 03:01:17,930
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Maren, thank you so much for the call.

2335
03:01:17,950 --> 03:01:19,551
[SPEAKER_02]: You take care and have a great new year, okay?

2336
03:01:20,112 --> 03:01:20,392
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.

2337
03:01:20,432 --> 03:01:20,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

2338
03:01:20,913 --> 03:01:21,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

2339
03:01:23,462 --> 03:01:26,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Bochikawa on chat says they're just trying to bribe me with the introduction speech.

2340
03:01:27,303 --> 03:01:28,403
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get to another call.

2341
03:01:28,903 --> 03:01:30,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is going to be our last call of the night.

2342
03:01:31,184 --> 03:01:35,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I understand, the 1-877 number is not working, and I apologize for that.

2343
03:01:35,965 --> 03:01:37,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the hell is going on.

2344
03:01:37,605 --> 03:01:40,886
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be one of those things I don't find out about until the show starts, so I apologize.

2345
03:01:41,326 --> 03:01:43,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Rama, you're on the phone.

2346
03:01:43,446 --> 03:01:43,766
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

2347
03:01:44,686 --> 03:01:47,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you couldn't have an end-of-year show without me, guys.

2348
03:01:48,027 --> 03:01:51,188
[SPEAKER_02]: You do seem like a fitting personality to have here at the end of the year.

2349
03:01:51,268 --> 03:01:51,868
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2350
03:01:52,717 --> 03:01:53,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Not too much.

2351
03:01:53,558 --> 03:01:56,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to give what I thought was my game of the year.

2352
03:01:57,400 --> 03:01:57,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, please.

2353
03:01:58,020 --> 03:01:58,981
[SPEAKER_11]: What was your game of the year?

2354
03:02:00,001 --> 03:02:01,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Ghostbusters, the video game.

2355
03:02:02,023 --> 03:02:02,963
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.

2356
03:02:03,824 --> 03:02:04,764
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

2357
03:02:04,784 --> 03:02:05,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was.

2358
03:02:06,585 --> 03:02:07,706
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it about this game?

2359
03:02:07,766 --> 03:02:09,107
[SPEAKER_02]: What made it so goddamn awesome?

2360
03:02:10,027 --> 03:02:17,031
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how whenever they do a movie to video game, the video game generally sucks donkey balls.

2361
03:02:17,412 --> 03:02:17,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

2362
03:02:18,544 --> 03:02:37,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Ghostbusters the video game is one of those shining gems where it came out really good granted it's not really based off the movie on the same token it's like a sequel to the first two movies but you still kind of go through elements of the first two movies as you play the game which I thought was fun

2363
03:02:39,760 --> 03:02:41,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Game of the Year Game of the Year

2364
03:03:09,946 --> 03:03:10,367
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2365
03:03:28,828 --> 03:03:29,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Game of the Decade.

2366
03:03:29,749 --> 03:03:30,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, this is so much.

2367
03:03:32,351 --> 03:03:32,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

2368
03:03:33,892 --> 03:03:36,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I can really pinpoint a Game of the Decade.

2369
03:03:37,074 --> 03:03:38,255
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I really could.

2370
03:03:38,275 --> 03:03:40,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd actually have to sit there and think about that.

2371
03:03:41,107 --> 03:03:49,050
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think a lot of people can truly, even though we read this list off of Yahoo and so forth and said, you know, they did a pretty good job, at least of where to start.

2372
03:03:49,490 --> 03:03:55,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you will truly be able to know what the biggest games of the decade were until about five years from now.

2373
03:03:55,533 --> 03:04:00,635
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're really able to accurately look back and say, okay, what games really shaped where we're at now?

2374
03:04:00,955 --> 03:04:03,696
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of do that a little bit with the earlier games in the decade.

2375
03:04:03,736 --> 03:04:08,298
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, we were having a chat earlier about how Diablo 2 ultimately shaped World of Warcraft.

2376
03:04:08,618 --> 03:04:09,559
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think...

2377
03:04:10,659 --> 03:04:11,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting to see.

2378
03:04:12,701 --> 03:04:20,086
[SPEAKER_02]: If some of these things like Natal and the Sony ice cream cone fail, then you can say that maybe Wii Sports wasn't as big as we thought it was.

2379
03:04:20,126 --> 03:04:21,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it really was just a flash in the pan.

2380
03:04:21,948 --> 03:04:25,931
[SPEAKER_02]: But if these two things blow up, then it kind of adds value to Wii Sports in a way.

2381
03:04:26,923 --> 03:04:27,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much.

2382
03:04:27,763 --> 03:04:34,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can't really say on the PC side of things with Diablo because I grew up mostly doing console gaming.

2383
03:04:35,006 --> 03:04:39,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had a PC, but nothing worthy of playing half these games that are out there.

2384
03:04:39,528 --> 03:04:44,270
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I saw some of these games in the store, I was always drawn towards the console games.

2385
03:04:46,051 --> 03:04:49,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's a lot of people in that same boat.

2386
03:04:49,152 --> 03:04:51,013
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people also the exact opposite.

2387
03:04:51,033 --> 03:04:52,434
[SPEAKER_02]: They just can't get into the consoles.

2388
03:04:52,494 --> 03:04:55,795
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to play on the PC with the keyboard and the mouse or it just doesn't work.

2389
03:04:57,054 --> 03:04:58,815
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the reasons why I don't play Halo.

2390
03:05:01,017 --> 03:05:01,297
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2391
03:05:01,557 --> 03:05:04,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ranma, you're going to be the last call of the year.

2392
03:05:04,979 --> 03:05:06,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2393
03:05:07,341 --> 03:05:08,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, a couple of things.

2394
03:05:08,381 --> 03:05:13,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, a few episodes back, you had mentioned whatever happened to TradeWest.

2395
03:05:14,646 --> 03:05:14,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2396
03:05:16,767 --> 03:05:21,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a couple of years after they did Double Dragon, they were acquired by Midway.

2397
03:05:22,612 --> 03:05:23,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

2398
03:05:23,473 --> 03:05:23,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2399
03:05:23,993 --> 03:05:28,517
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're pretty much no more, is my assumption.

2400
03:05:28,697 --> 03:05:29,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

2401
03:05:29,458 --> 03:05:33,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes sense, because I want to say Midway did some Double Dragon games later on, so that makes total sense.

2402
03:05:34,002 --> 03:05:34,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2403
03:05:35,603 --> 03:05:42,169
[SPEAKER_11]: And last thing I'll leave this note on to you, Jamie, Matt, thank you.

2404
03:05:43,536 --> 03:05:44,177
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

2405
03:05:44,217 --> 03:05:44,737
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

2406
03:05:45,157 --> 03:05:45,838
[SPEAKER_11]: No, really.

2407
03:05:45,958 --> 03:05:50,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I tune in every Sunday to listen to you guys talk about gaming.

2408
03:05:50,981 --> 03:05:57,426
[SPEAKER_11]: And from time to time, you guys move off of gaming, talk about stuff in your personal lives, which do affect all of us.

2409
03:05:57,826 --> 03:06:05,492
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like the fact that we can come together as a family and discuss some of these things like Proposition 8 and so forth.

2410
03:06:06,072 --> 03:06:08,054
[SPEAKER_11]: That was something I really appreciate.

2411
03:06:08,874 --> 03:06:10,876
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like that one time, you know,

2412
03:06:11,897 --> 03:06:25,734
[SPEAKER_11]: deviate from the gaming talk about something that's more important more of an impact in our lives that we need to discuss and see how we all feel about that so that's something I appreciate and you know what thank you

2413
03:06:26,962 --> 03:06:27,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

2414
03:06:27,723 --> 03:06:32,107
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes us feel very good about what we do, certainly.

2415
03:06:33,508 --> 03:06:35,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sometimes I'm kind of joking.

2416
03:06:35,569 --> 03:06:38,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes my role on the show is to try and make sure we get back to the games at some point.

2417
03:06:39,353 --> 03:06:43,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I've certainly, with some of the things you mentioned, kind of gone astray myself.

2418
03:06:44,217 --> 03:06:46,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really thankful that the audience...

2419
03:06:47,359 --> 03:06:48,640
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2420
03:07:06,548 --> 03:07:15,610
[SPEAKER_02]: is astounding and it's been something that's kind of grown through this whole decade and it's going to continue on over the next few... We are the LL Army.

2421
03:07:15,870 --> 03:07:16,310
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2422
03:07:16,970 --> 03:07:26,832
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you know, at first I felt like I should be kind of offended that you're bringing in personal stuff but then I realized if you guys don't talk about it and bring it up, who is?

2423
03:07:26,972 --> 03:07:28,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we all listen to you guys.

2424
03:07:28,913 --> 03:07:31,573
[SPEAKER_11]: You're like the voice of gaming to us.

2425
03:07:31,613 --> 03:07:34,874
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we're like one giant happy mafia family.

2426
03:07:35,819 --> 03:07:39,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, don't put that responsibility on us or we might get scared.

2427
03:07:40,085 --> 03:07:42,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I've already got a whole back full of tattoos now.

2428
03:07:42,622 --> 03:07:43,823
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2429
03:08:09,281 --> 03:08:09,781
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2430
03:08:32,793 --> 03:08:33,754
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

2431
03:08:50,253 --> 03:08:50,833
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

2432
03:09:14,449 --> 03:09:15,349
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to come back and see us too.

2433
03:09:43,600 --> 03:10:08,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Fanime was a blast I'm planning on it and working on bringing Jodea, Misty I'm working on it one way or another even if that means I gotta pack them in boxes and ship them Metal Gear Solid Snake style we'll be there for the 4th of July I'm actually wanting to get to New York I would love to find my way up there sometime

2434
03:10:09,791 --> 03:10:13,792
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's been since I was 17 years old was the last time.

2435
03:10:14,052 --> 03:10:15,273
[SPEAKER_09]: The one and only time, I think.

2436
03:10:15,993 --> 03:10:18,774
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I went once when I was an infant, so therefore I don't remember it.

2437
03:10:19,154 --> 03:10:21,435
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was the last time I went to New York.

2438
03:10:22,735 --> 03:10:24,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at it this way, Amy.

2439
03:10:24,316 --> 03:10:28,097
[SPEAKER_11]: If you come out here, Patty's has a room just for you.

2440
03:10:28,137 --> 03:10:29,618
[SPEAKER_11]: The bed is ready and everything.

2441
03:10:29,878 --> 03:10:32,238
[SPEAKER_11]: It says DarkSakura's guest room right there.

2442
03:10:32,599 --> 03:10:32,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

2443
03:10:32,759 --> 03:10:33,559
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just looking for you.

2444
03:10:34,528 --> 03:10:36,469
[SPEAKER_09]: So who's got 400 bucks I can borrow, huh?

2445
03:10:36,669 --> 03:10:38,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Sister Act's supposed to be on Broadway this next year.

2446
03:10:38,690 --> 03:10:39,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coming out there to see that.

2447
03:10:39,830 --> 03:10:40,231
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that.

2448
03:10:40,631 --> 03:10:40,871
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2449
03:10:40,891 --> 03:10:43,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Ranma, this is also going on the longest call of the decade.

2450
03:10:43,612 --> 03:10:45,553
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to say thank you.

2451
03:10:45,673 --> 03:10:46,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2452
03:10:46,133 --> 03:10:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was all worth it.

2453
03:10:47,374 --> 03:10:47,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2454
03:10:47,734 --> 03:10:48,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a wonderful night.

2455
03:10:48,514 --> 03:10:50,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for being a longtime supporter of the show.

2456
03:10:50,535 --> 03:10:51,316
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate it.

2457
03:10:51,676 --> 03:10:54,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And really a lot of people that called in tonight were in that same boat.

2458
03:10:54,397 --> 03:10:55,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Ranma.

2459
03:10:55,197 --> 03:10:55,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

2460
03:10:56,138 --> 03:10:56,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.

2461
03:10:58,215 --> 03:10:59,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, apologies to those that didn't get through.

2462
03:11:00,418 --> 03:11:04,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And apologies that the 877 number apparently was borked and I was unaware.

2463
03:11:04,683 --> 03:11:05,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do that on purpose.

2464
03:11:05,784 --> 03:11:08,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologize to you guys who weren't able to get through because of that.

2465
03:11:09,048 --> 03:11:10,469
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are going to leave it at that note.

2466
03:11:10,549 --> 03:11:12,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course we'll be back here next week.

2467
03:11:12,912 --> 03:11:13,513
[SPEAKER_02]: We always are.

2468
03:11:13,993 --> 03:11:14,754
[SPEAKER_02]: To do it all again.

2469
03:11:14,814 --> 03:11:15,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Take more calls.

2470
03:11:15,595 --> 03:11:16,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Do more emails.

2471
03:11:16,456 --> 03:11:16,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it again.

2472
03:11:17,898 --> 03:11:18,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Until...

2473
03:11:19,324 --> 03:11:21,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Our lives change and we're just not able to do it anymore.

2474
03:11:21,945 --> 03:11:22,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know when that's going to be.

2475
03:11:22,845 --> 03:11:24,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to focus on that right now.

2476
03:11:24,526 --> 03:11:30,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just focus on what a great decade it's been for video games and it's just going to continue to grow and who knows what the future holds.

2477
03:11:31,069 --> 03:11:31,769
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be crazy.

2478
03:11:32,569 --> 03:11:35,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's that part of the show where we go around to get everybody's final thoughts.

2479
03:11:35,611 --> 03:11:37,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, quickly, are there any last minute stories?

2480
03:11:37,511 --> 03:11:39,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to have Loki clear those out.

2481
03:11:39,232 --> 03:11:41,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Just really quickly, stupid things.

2482
03:11:41,634 --> 03:11:45,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I mentioned before, Dark Void coming out from Capcom.

2483
03:11:45,638 --> 03:11:52,243
[SPEAKER_03]: There is also going to be a DSi game coming out as well for Dark Void that's being done in the 8-bit retro style.

2484
03:11:52,664 --> 03:11:55,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be kind of a side-scroller game, so that's going to be pretty awesome.

2485
03:11:55,867 --> 03:11:57,228
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be out in January for $5.

2486
03:11:58,008 --> 03:11:58,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Does look neat.

2487
03:11:59,677 --> 03:12:00,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Aliens vs Predators

2488
03:12:14,372 --> 03:12:17,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Prinny is getting a sequel on the PSP, Prinny 2.

2489
03:12:19,074 --> 03:12:25,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's about, apparently, you have to reclaim Etna's stolen underwear.

2490
03:12:25,858 --> 03:12:30,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the game is actually called Prinny 2, Dawn of the Great Pantsu War.

2491
03:12:32,901 --> 03:12:34,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be out in Japan on March 25th.

2492
03:12:34,682 --> 03:12:35,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Pantsu?

2493
03:12:35,843 --> 03:12:36,083
Yes.

2494
03:12:37,624 --> 03:12:38,244
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I had.

2495
03:12:38,344 --> 03:12:41,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and apparently, and I read this and just said...

2496
03:12:43,289 --> 03:12:45,632
[SPEAKER_03]: That's stupid, but hey, I'll add it to the show roll.

2497
03:12:47,234 --> 03:12:53,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, John Gosselin's Wii was stolen.

2498
03:12:53,982 --> 03:12:58,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Who gives a shit about that douchebag?

2499
03:13:00,143 --> 03:13:06,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Let him go to the cemetery of news people we just don't care about anymore.

2500
03:13:06,789 --> 03:13:08,590
[SPEAKER_02]: He is no longer relevant.

2501
03:13:08,770 --> 03:13:09,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Bam.

2502
03:13:09,591 --> 03:13:09,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.

2503
03:13:11,153 --> 03:13:13,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares that he had a Wii that got stolen?

2504
03:13:13,394 --> 03:13:14,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sorry.

2505
03:13:14,696 --> 03:13:19,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, there's also a free New Year's theme for Xbox Live, so you can download that.

2506
03:13:19,179 --> 03:13:19,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Yippee skippee.

2507
03:13:20,020 --> 03:13:24,344
[SPEAKER_02]: But look, who cares about some a-hole in his Wii?

2508
03:13:24,364 --> 03:13:25,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Just forget it.

2509
03:13:26,488 --> 03:13:29,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I don't think people should steal things even if the guy is a douchebag.

2510
03:13:29,830 --> 03:13:32,051
[SPEAKER_02]: But now when you steal it, people just report on it.

2511
03:13:32,091 --> 03:13:34,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you've done a double bad thing by stealing his Wii.

2512
03:13:36,114 --> 03:13:38,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I don't mean to end this on a negative note.

2513
03:13:38,855 --> 03:13:39,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you, Loki.

2514
03:13:40,296 --> 03:13:42,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2515
03:13:44,118 --> 03:13:45,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

2516
03:13:45,699 --> 03:13:49,882
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I need to install more games on my main cabinet.

2517
03:13:52,318 --> 03:13:56,102
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I hope I get enough sleep because I gotta go back to work tomorrow.

2518
03:13:56,263 --> 03:13:57,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo.

2519
03:13:57,404 --> 03:13:57,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Tanaro.

2520
03:13:58,606 --> 03:13:59,667
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2521
03:14:03,572 --> 03:14:06,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I only have three words, Rob.

2522
03:14:07,276 --> 03:14:08,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Reject false icons.

2523
03:14:09,264 --> 03:14:10,385
[SPEAKER_02]: A very lovely thought to end on.

2524
03:14:11,285 --> 03:14:18,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, don't forget about Orange Lounge Revolution's second mix, the awesome tribute project that's out there that our fans put together.
