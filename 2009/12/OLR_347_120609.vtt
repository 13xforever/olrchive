00:00.000 --> 00:18.240
Today, December 6, 2009, Steam is about to get some more competition.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.080
Could you soon play PSP Minis on your PS3?

00:21.080 --> 00:32.880
And the long-lasting video game rumor is revealed to be true this week.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.640
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.640 --> 00:37.640
Radio.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.180
We are that video game talk show dedicated to, of course, video games.

00:41.180 --> 00:44.600
Video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and food!

00:44.600 --> 00:46.180
Lots and lots of food!

00:46.180 --> 00:47.180
And crocheting.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.260
Nom nom nom.

00:48.260 --> 00:49.260
And yarn.

00:49.260 --> 00:52.400
I'm doing a third crocheting because I don't have the patience for that stuff.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.400
And you've crocheted.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.840
By the way, of course, the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, and I'm Rob Roberts.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.840
I'm making a hat.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.840
And he's Techmaster Loki.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.840
Why not just introduce him too?

00:59.840 --> 01:00.840
How you doing, Techmaster Loki?

01:00.840 --> 01:01.840
I'm doing fine.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.840
Amazing.

01:02.840 --> 01:03.840
Okay, so crocheting.

01:03.840 --> 01:04.840
I don't have the patience for that.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.840
Okay.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.840
Just saying.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.040
I didn't think I did either, but it's actually fairly therapeutic.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
Do you, what do you do?

01:11.040 --> 01:15.480
Like, because I know a lot of people will watch TV while they crochet or, you know,

01:15.480 --> 01:16.480
do whatever.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.240
Do you have an activity that you do when you crochet?

01:19.240 --> 01:22.640
I sit in front of my computer and chat with Becky.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.240
Or whoever else is on.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.240
And watch random YouTubers?

01:25.240 --> 01:26.240
No.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.320
Well, sometimes I'll watch other people crocheting while I crochet.

01:29.320 --> 01:33.240
It's sort of like eating food while you're watching Food Network or watching porn while

01:33.240 --> 01:34.240
you fuck.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.120
Or in my case, watching The Biggest Loser while eating a giant pizza.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.120
That's what I like to do.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.480
It makes me feel good about myself.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.400
Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?

01:43.400 --> 01:45.200
How's your week going?

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
It's okay.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
Yeah?

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
Just okay?

01:48.200 --> 01:49.200
Yeah, it's all right.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
I'm sorry to hear it's not awesome.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.600
It'd be more awesome if I didn't break a PSP.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.600
Uh oh.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.600
All right.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.600
What happened?

01:56.600 --> 01:59.280
So the further adventures of your, for those that heard last week's show, which sadly hasn't

01:59.280 --> 02:02.080
hit the podcast, we had an internal issue here.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.440
One of the files didn't make it to our server, so we didn't get the podcast up on time.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.160
It'll be up very soon.

02:07.160 --> 02:11.160
But you've been working on a homebrew PSP machine, right?

02:11.160 --> 02:12.160
Yeah.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.040
PSP arcade cabinet, I guess.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.640
Sort of bar top cabinet.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.080
That looks ghetto.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.480
There's pictures of it at orangeonshade.com at the top.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.480
It's awesome.

02:21.480 --> 02:22.480
No, it's ghetto awesome.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.480
Yes.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.040
So there's something, I don't know what happened with it.

02:26.040 --> 02:31.800
It was something because I had wired up the analog stick to the directional joystick that

02:31.800 --> 02:32.800
I had.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.800
And there's a way you can do it.

02:33.800 --> 02:34.800
It's pretty easy.

02:34.800 --> 02:39.960
And the contact points are a lot bigger than trying to solder to the small, really tiny

02:39.960 --> 02:45.800
ribbon cable solder points that are for the actual digital directional pad.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.880
So I figured, okay, I'll just solder to that.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.760
Well, something happened, and I'm not sure what.

02:51.760 --> 02:55.400
I thought I bridged something, but apparently that wasn't the case.

02:55.400 --> 03:02.640
And for whatever reason, the PSP seemed like it was only pressing down, and it just consistently

03:02.640 --> 03:05.740
held down, down.

03:05.740 --> 03:10.640
So that made it hard to kind of select games, play anything, because it would be always

03:10.640 --> 03:12.420
pressing down.

03:12.420 --> 03:16.360
So I figured, okay, I'm going to look at it and see what I did solder-wise.

03:16.360 --> 03:23.400
And I looked at what was supposed to be bridged to enable down to be pressed, and it was impossible

03:23.400 --> 03:26.720
for me to have done something to actually cause that.

03:26.720 --> 03:31.560
So I actually broke something in there somewhere.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.520
Unfortunately I can't fix that.

03:33.520 --> 03:40.580
So I'm just going to kind of take a break from it right now, because there's not much

03:40.580 --> 03:41.580
I can really do with it.

03:41.580 --> 03:44.200
Well it's going to be frustrating that you build this whole machine and then it just

03:44.200 --> 03:45.200
oops.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.200
Well yeah, it was all ready to go.

03:46.200 --> 03:50.720
I had some trouble earlier in the week, I couldn't get it to stay powered on, and that

03:50.720 --> 03:56.800
I realized was a mistake because I had hooked up a push button backwards, so it was hooked

03:56.800 --> 04:00.880
to the normally open instead of the normally closed.

04:00.880 --> 04:06.840
And that causes it to basically, when the button's not being pressed, the button is

04:06.840 --> 04:09.660
pressed, and then when you push the button, the button isn't pressed.

04:09.660 --> 04:11.820
So it's kind of backwards.

04:11.820 --> 04:16.560
And once I fixed that, it worked just fine, powered up, everything was hunky dory, and

04:16.560 --> 04:23.240
then I tested what buttons worked and what didn't, and apparently my R button didn't

04:23.240 --> 04:29.160
really work, which I'm guessing is because the solder point was super tiny, so I probably

04:29.160 --> 04:34.160
missed it when I was soldering, and my triangle button wasn't working, which I didn't really

04:34.160 --> 04:41.600
even get to the point to fix that yet, and then the constantly pressing down thing, which

04:41.600 --> 04:44.880
was kind of annoying.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.720
But that's really it.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.680
Otherwise, it worked enough for me to try out one of the games and it looked awesome.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.660
It sort of worked, it's just not quite everything yet.

04:56.660 --> 05:02.000
But there's a lot of it that's salvageable, and honestly, if I want to try again, I mean,

05:02.000 --> 05:08.280
PSPs are dirt cheap, if I look on Craigslist, I can get one sub $50, so if I wanted to do

05:08.280 --> 05:09.280
that.

05:09.280 --> 05:14.720
And at the same time, I actually figured out a way requiring an extra device to be purchased,

05:14.720 --> 05:21.080
but there is a way that's actually super easy to do that, and not only will I be able to

05:21.080 --> 05:25.680
use the PSP in the arcade cabinet, it won't actually damage the PSP and I can actually

05:25.680 --> 05:32.600
take it out of the arcade cabinet for whatever reason, so I may go that route if I decide

05:32.600 --> 05:37.160
I really want to do this, but at the same time, I've got parts for Bartop actually coming,

05:37.160 --> 05:42.880
so I don't really, it doesn't matter anyways, because I will have a working Bartop cabinet.

05:42.880 --> 05:47.120
I love that you just haven't totally given up, it'll come back stronger, PSP Cabinet

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
2.0.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.120
Yeah.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.120
Bigger and better.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.000
And at the same time, it was kind of a learning experience, because now I know how to solder

05:53.000 --> 06:00.520
slightly better, not enough to where I need to solder these like really small wires onto

06:00.520 --> 06:04.160
these contacts, and it was just, it was a mess.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.600
It was super delicate, I mean there was so much that could have gone wrong, and a lot

06:07.600 --> 06:14.400
of it did, and it was just, it wasn't pretty, so the second time around it'll be a lot better,

06:14.400 --> 06:20.040
and a lot cleaner, and should work, but when I actually get around to that, I don't know,

06:20.040 --> 06:26.080
because I have a lot of other things I've got to work on, so it will not be forgotten,

06:26.080 --> 06:27.640
it will be taken care of at some point.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.440
Plus it's just a busy time of year, you know, this isn't the best time to start a big project,

06:31.440 --> 06:32.440
so.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.220
Well I have other projects, you know, and I tend to start projects when I have other

06:35.220 --> 06:40.280
projects going, and don't finish things, and I have my arcade cabinet, you know, the actual

06:40.280 --> 06:44.920
arcade cabinet that I've, you know, got everything almost ready for that, I was just working

06:44.920 --> 06:50.760
on the front end to, you know, get some of the themes I had for hyperspin the work correctly,

06:50.760 --> 06:55.600
and you know, otherwise it's ready to go, so I may just play around with that, actually

06:55.600 --> 07:00.720
enjoy the fruits of my labor, and then later on, you know, tackle this stuff.

07:00.720 --> 07:07.000
Actually, I, for whatever reason on an impulse buy, I purchased a, what they call a, a Dingo

07:07.000 --> 07:14.920
A320, which, you know, it's not an actual Dingo, but it's a little, um, little small

07:14.920 --> 07:20.440
portable emulation device, actually, that you can use to, it actually has built-in emulators

07:20.440 --> 07:29.400
for Neo Geo, CPS 1 and 2, NES, Genesis, you name it, and it actually has video out on

07:29.400 --> 07:34.840
it and stuff, and I actually have looked at a picture of it taken apart, and I probably

07:34.840 --> 07:40.080
could turn that into a cabinet as well, if I wanted to, in place of this, because I could

07:40.080 --> 07:47.760
hook up the video out to an old PS1 LCD monitor that I have still, so maybe, but then again,

07:47.760 --> 07:51.560
you know, it's pretty nice and I don't want to kind of mess that up, so I'll just probably

07:51.560 --> 07:57.160
get another PSP and just do it, I'll fix it this time, but other than that, you know,

07:57.160 --> 08:01.480
um, yeah, that's pretty much what I've been doing, other than, you know, Grand Theft Auto

08:01.480 --> 08:02.480
and stuff.

08:02.480 --> 08:06.000
Alright, well, I was going to get into gaming weeks, but you pretty much took the cake with

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
that one, that's alright.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.080
Let's go over to Jamie, how was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

08:11.080 --> 08:15.320
I played, I played World of Warcraft and knitted, or crocheted.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.960
Yes, did you crochet while playing World of Warcraft?

08:17.960 --> 08:18.960
Yes actually I did.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.960
That's talented.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.960
Yesterday.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
Uh huh.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.320
I basically, um, because I was doing some stuff on my Night Elf, I just basically go,

08:25.320 --> 08:30.240
okay, I'm tired of playing, you know, hide, that, whatever that racial ability is to blend

08:30.240 --> 08:31.240
into shadows.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.240
Right.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.240
You know, hide.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.200
Okay, I'm done playing.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.040
So yeah, that was about what I did.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.040
Very cool.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.040
Um, let's see.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.720
Oh, and watch Dan play Borderlands.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.600
I watched a little bit of that, I'm not super familiar with Borderlands, although I've heard

08:45.600 --> 08:48.760
a lot of good things about it, and I was watching Dan play a little bit of it as I was walking

08:48.760 --> 08:49.760
in tonight.

08:49.760 --> 08:54.320
It looks, uh, it looks very comic book- I like the crazy mutant midgets.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.320
Is that what they're actually called?

08:55.320 --> 08:58.120
Yes, the crazy mutant midgets or something like that.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.120
Amazing.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.560
Um, Loki, was there anything else for your gaming week, I know you're talking about hacks,

09:01.560 --> 09:03.080
other games you've been playing?

09:03.080 --> 09:05.080
Just Grand Theft Auto.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.080
That's pretty much it.

09:06.080 --> 09:10.800
I, you know, all the opportunity that I had to play games this weekend, I was just too

09:10.800 --> 09:13.920
busy working on that stupid box cabinet thing.

09:13.920 --> 09:14.920
Nice.

09:14.920 --> 09:19.460
Um, let's see, my gaming week, uh, two new games, one just a demo, so I can't really

09:19.460 --> 09:23.680
tell you about the game, but the demo I played was Bayonetta, and didn't know a whole lot

09:23.680 --> 09:27.400
about the game, like I kinda knew it was like a Devil May Cry-ish game with a hot chick

09:27.400 --> 09:28.400
as the main character.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.400
That's awesome.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.400
I didn't know a whole lot about it, but one of my friends was like, no, you really, really

09:33.400 --> 09:37.240
need to play this demo, it's quite astounding, and I was like, okay, I'll check it out, you

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
know, what have I got to lose?

09:38.240 --> 09:39.480
I'm not paying anything for it.

09:39.480 --> 09:43.480
So um, went over to his place and saw it on a 360, because you know mine's been broken

09:43.480 --> 09:47.320
for a while now, and uh, was blown away.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.600
It's amazing.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.640
And so I actually sat down to play it, just played it on normal mode, because I was like,

09:51.640 --> 09:56.560
should I play it on normal or easy, and normal of course, so played through it, um, a little

09:56.560 --> 10:02.720
bit of button mashing, but fun, way fun, and you know, there is a science to it, and um,

10:02.720 --> 10:06.280
you know, you have your punches and your kicks and your jump, but a lot of the game revolves

10:06.280 --> 10:10.000
around being able to block at just the right time that will activate what's called the

10:10.000 --> 10:14.360
witch time, where things slow down and get more matrix-y, and then, you know, you can

10:14.360 --> 10:19.000
do these finishing moves that are called tortures, where you might push somebody into one of

10:19.000 --> 10:25.160
those statues with the spikes in it that'll slam shut on them, or guillotine, but what

10:25.160 --> 10:27.840
makes this game great is a couple of things.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.440
How amazingly over-the-freaking-top it is.

10:30.440 --> 10:37.360
It's obviously extremely violent, blood everywhere, heads rolling, just, you know, extreme violence,

10:37.360 --> 10:43.640
and uh, just the little touches make it fabulous, like, for instance, when she will kick a demon

10:43.640 --> 10:47.800
into the guillotine, she snaps her fingers for the blades to fall, and little hearts

10:47.800 --> 10:50.280
appear above the, um, fingers.

10:50.280 --> 10:55.280
Her shadow is an image of a butterfly, which is a symbol that you see throughout the game,

10:55.280 --> 11:01.320
and you know, just all these little, uh, it's so over-the-top, I was laughing and laughing

11:01.320 --> 11:05.960
and laughing, and just this move where, like, you spin the controller, like, 360 degrees

11:05.960 --> 11:09.380
and hit one of the buttons, and then she'll get on the ground and start, like, her high

11:09.380 --> 11:13.600
heels are guns, so she starts shooting from her high heels, and you can actually, like,

11:13.600 --> 11:19.260
aim at the monsters, it is insanity, and I loved every minute of it, so I am so excited

11:19.260 --> 11:23.160
for the full version of the game, because it was just so over-the-top, and some of the

11:23.160 --> 11:28.520
boss fights were extremely silly, I, I can't believe how much I enjoyed this game, because

11:28.520 --> 11:33.900
it's not usually the type of game I'm all into, but just the absurdness and over-the-topness

11:33.900 --> 11:37.800
and the design of the characters, I can see why now this game is getting all the praise

11:37.800 --> 11:38.800
it is.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.400
I, I, uh, I, I had a good time.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.780
And by the way, did you notice she's wearing her hair?

11:43.780 --> 11:48.120
Her hair is like her weapon, and she turns her hair into demons that will bite the heads

11:48.120 --> 11:49.120
off of monsters.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.120
She has witch hair.

11:50.120 --> 11:56.640
Which conveniently leaves her with a naked booty, or a thong or something, so, who would

11:56.640 --> 11:59.000
win in a fight, Bayonetta or the Baroness?

11:59.000 --> 12:03.160
Uh, I, I would have to say, Bayonetta is gonna just kick her into a guillotine and snap her

12:03.160 --> 12:07.720
fingers and it's over, so, you know, with, with all due respect to the, the, the Baroness.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.960
I guess they're saying, uh, in chat room, uh, Tiger Claw says, Bayonetta looks like

12:10.960 --> 12:11.960
the Baroness.

12:11.960 --> 12:16.680
And if you want to join us in our chat, chat.orangelauntrader.com, of course, is always the place you can do

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
that.

12:17.680 --> 12:22.760
And I really do need to play that game, because I have my, my Japanese 360 now, and I actually

12:22.760 --> 12:23.760
do have the game.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.360
I just haven't played it yet, because I've been working on crap like, you know.

12:27.360 --> 12:31.000
You really need to, you need to play it, and seriously, call me when you do, because I

12:31.000 --> 12:33.480
want to hear your initial impressions before next week's show.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.000
You need to bring it over.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.240
Yeah, I, I want to play the full one.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.240
Looks like fun.

12:39.240 --> 12:44.440
All right, anyhow, um, also my gaming week, um, not a demo, but, uh, a full game, and

12:44.440 --> 12:46.240
one I've been intending to play for a while.

12:46.240 --> 12:50.360
New Super Mario Brothers Wii, which is a game I played at E3, and I was kind of like, yeah,

12:50.360 --> 12:51.360
it's okay.

12:51.360 --> 12:55.000
You know, I, I, I played it with one of the nice booth babes there, who was trying to

12:55.000 --> 12:58.440
show me the parts of the game, and obviously I was getting into the multiplayer experience,

12:58.440 --> 13:00.460
and I was like, yeah, it's okay.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.600
But I wish that they would go back, and I said this on the show a couple weeks ago,

13:03.600 --> 13:09.120
I said, I really want them to go back and make, like, Super Mario Brothers 4, or something

13:09.120 --> 13:10.120
like that.

13:10.120 --> 13:15.040
Like, a game like the old Mario Brothers, that kind of, without all this, like, extra

13:15.040 --> 13:18.560
frilly stuff that they've kind of done in some of the more recent Mario releases, and

13:18.560 --> 13:20.400
3D, and all that stuff.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.040
And I have to admit, I was wrong.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.160
This is that game.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.560
This is the game I wanted.

13:26.560 --> 13:31.880
This is the new, it really is the new Super Mario Brothers, with everything that you remember

13:31.880 --> 13:35.000
from the old games, with the addition of multiplayer.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.440
And so I totally misjudged this game in the beginning, and I think it's amazing.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.120
I have, I had a lot of fun playing this game.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.280
I really enjoyed the single-player mode, kind of, it's really just a hybrid.

13:45.280 --> 13:49.720
Like, there's so much throwbacks to all the old Mario games, like, it's like, you have

13:49.720 --> 13:54.220
a map that reminds you of Mario 3 with the minigames, but then you have Yoshi and a lot

13:54.220 --> 13:59.760
of the monsters from, you know, Super Mario World, and then it's just, it's just really

13:59.760 --> 14:03.800
interesting kind of how all the Mario games kind of blend together into this.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.680
And then on top of that, there's this multiplayer mode, which is kind of, it's really fun.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.000
It's a great party game.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.920
It's a little bit difficult, because you can really unintentionally kill people and hurt

14:14.920 --> 14:19.520
them, and there's no way to really make the difficulty easier.

14:19.520 --> 14:24.380
And as I heard Bobby mention on his show, of course, Bobby Blackwell's always on before

14:24.380 --> 14:28.580
we are at All Games Radio and we broadcast live on Sunday nights, he was kind of talking

14:28.580 --> 14:33.280
about how there wasn't really a tutorial mode, so if you've never played a Mario game before,

14:33.280 --> 14:34.560
there's a lot of stuff you miss.

14:34.560 --> 14:38.960
And I kind of agree with that, like, if the game has one flaw, it was that I didn't know

14:38.960 --> 14:44.400
you could hit the A button to avoid death in multiplayer mode until a little ways into

14:44.400 --> 14:45.400
it playing with friends.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.540
And I suppose the discovery of it was okay, but yeah, I would have liked, since, you know,

14:49.540 --> 14:54.620
this is supposed to be something for everyone, there to be a little more of a basic tutorial

14:54.620 --> 14:59.840
mode, but honestly, that's a very minor flaw in what is otherwise a stellar game and just

14:59.840 --> 15:03.520
a really fun multiplayer experience with a lot of variety.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.440
You know, there's some new suits, like the propeller suit and the penguin suit, and now

15:07.440 --> 15:13.400
you have ice balls as well as fireballs, and, you know, they do add a little, some new mechanics

15:13.400 --> 15:17.400
with the Wiimote, but it's nothing too crazy or over the top, like you can tilt the Wiimote

15:17.400 --> 15:22.160
to tilt some platforms and some levels, and you shake it to do a helicopter type move

15:22.160 --> 15:23.680
when you have the propeller suit on.

15:23.680 --> 15:29.280
It's nothing too crazy, so I was really happy for this game.

15:29.280 --> 15:33.600
Reading some comments from chat, Zappy says, I guess Sky never played Super Mario Brothers

15:33.600 --> 15:34.600
on the DS.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.600
Actually, that's not true.

15:35.600 --> 15:40.560
I did play it on the DS, but you have to kind of go back and remember that I have an extreme

15:40.560 --> 15:45.280
bias against handheld games, especially when they are porting over games that I remember

15:45.280 --> 15:50.440
from consoles, and I am the first to admit, it's completely irrational and stupid, but

15:50.440 --> 15:55.760
I don't like games I remember from my television playing big on my big sound speaker, larger

15:55.760 --> 16:00.040
than life, pushed into a little itty bitty box.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.280
I don't really often play portable games.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.480
I have a PSP, yes, I have a DS, yes, but I find that most of the time I play it is when

16:06.480 --> 16:10.360
I'm on a plane, and I really have literally nothing else I can play.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.880
I have this weird bias against portable gaming that is completely irrational and I can't

16:14.880 --> 16:18.680
explain, and so for that reason, I think I've never really given Super Mario Brothers DS

16:18.680 --> 16:23.160
the credit it deserves, so I'll admit it.

16:23.160 --> 16:29.600
Let's see, trying to look for some other questions from chat, let's see, again, if you want to

16:29.600 --> 16:34.680
join our chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, and I think they're talking about some other

16:34.680 --> 16:37.560
games, they're talking about Tekken and stuff in chat right now, which I did not play during

16:37.560 --> 16:42.880
my gaming week, but between those couple games and a little bit of other things here and

16:42.880 --> 16:47.080
there, you know, not a whole lot of other major games this week, but I really enjoyed

16:47.080 --> 16:51.160
Super Mario Brothers Wii, and you know, it's weird because every time, I know we've given

16:51.160 --> 16:54.960
Nintendo a hard time on this show, and we've come on here and we've said, you know, Nintendo

16:54.960 --> 16:59.940
is so out of touch with gaming, they don't, you know, they're not getting it, and Microsoft

16:59.940 --> 17:03.440
and Sony are doing all these things online that are, you know, miles ahead of what the

17:03.440 --> 17:08.240
Wii is doing, but then, damn, they always release a game like this that really reminds

17:08.240 --> 17:12.960
you, they do know how to do fun, it's just that, unfortunately, it's, you know, you only

17:12.960 --> 17:17.320
get a couple of these releases a year that kind of remind you of that fact, so.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.800
But I do recommend the game, especially, you know, if you played Mario 1 growing up, if

17:20.800 --> 17:24.840
you have that same desire I have, god, I wish they'd make a game like Mario 3 or Mario World

17:24.840 --> 17:25.840
again.

17:25.840 --> 17:26.840
This is that game.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.280
And then there's multiplayer in it to boot that's actually kind of fun, except for the

17:29.280 --> 17:32.240
fact that the princess isn't in it, but, you know, she got kidnapped again, what can you

17:32.240 --> 17:33.240
do?

17:33.240 --> 17:36.640
Of course, they could have, like, kidnapped Daisy, and I don't know, but whatever.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.560
All of her guards need to seriously...

17:39.560 --> 17:40.560
They need to get fired.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.880
No, they need to commit seppuku for their dishonor.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.480
Clearly, clearly.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.000
And she needs to hire better guards.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.840
Let's see, a comment from chat, Ricky Go Max says, I would play that Peach's Quest.

17:51.840 --> 17:56.640
You know, there was a game like that on DS, speaking of DS and everything, there was a

17:56.640 --> 17:59.160
Princess Peach game, Super Princess Peach, wasn't it called?

17:59.160 --> 18:00.160
Yeah.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.160
It was different, though.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.160
It wasn't really a Mario game.

18:02.160 --> 18:06.320
See, that was one of those, like, Nintendo, like, trying to take a Mario thing, and it

18:06.320 --> 18:08.680
was okay, but it wasn't Mario Brothers.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.280
It was Super PMS.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.360
Yeah, she used her emotions.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.480
I remember the emotions was a big part of that game.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.840
A little silly.

18:15.840 --> 18:20.720
So anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, some housekeeping on Wednesday.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.560
We will not be live next week.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.560
We will not have a live show next week, and that's completely my fault.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.020
I'm going to be out of town next Sunday.

18:29.020 --> 18:33.160
It's really no secret I'm going to see Lady Gaga in concert, and I couldn't be more excited,

18:33.160 --> 18:34.840
so sorry, guys.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.680
Opportunities like this don't happen every week.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.200
So I'm not going to be here live.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.660
I believe we're going to pre-tape.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.120
We're still trying to figure out what time we're pre-taping.

18:42.120 --> 18:46.560
I have to talk to Loki after the show, see if he's down with Saturday afternoon.

18:46.560 --> 18:51.520
And if it works out and it works in the all-game schedule that we could maybe go live when

18:51.520 --> 18:57.640
we pre-tape and not have to bump a show to do it, I would love to ask all games if we

18:57.640 --> 18:58.640
can go live.

18:58.640 --> 19:04.680
So stay tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook, twitter.com slash o-l-r and facebook.com slash

19:04.680 --> 19:08.880
Orange Launch Radio, all one word, and of course our website, orangelaunchradio.com,

19:08.880 --> 19:11.760
for the details on when that pre-taping will happen.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.560
So again, if you are used to coming here Sunday nights and listening, you're still going to

19:15.560 --> 19:16.680
get a new show next week.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.280
You will hear a new show Sunday night.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.820
It just won't be live.

19:19.820 --> 19:24.400
And you know, un-live shows are always a bit of a bummer because you don't have the chat

19:24.400 --> 19:28.240
room and the phone calls and all that, but we're hoping we'll still have a couple hours

19:28.240 --> 19:30.000
of some good hilarity.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And hopefully we'll get to tape live a little early.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
That would be great.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
So we'll see what happens.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Okay.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.480
Anyhow, let's move into some gaming news.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.640
We're only 20 minutes into the show, right?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.080
It's about time for some gaming news.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.080
Loki, start us off tonight.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.080
Yes.

19:44.080 --> 19:49.960
So, starting things off, this is kind of interesting, but not too surprising.

19:49.960 --> 19:53.960
Games for Windows Live, they've decided to add Games on Demand.

19:53.960 --> 19:59.580
You may remember that's a service that's been available right now on Xbox Live as their

19:59.580 --> 20:01.680
kind of digital download service.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.240
And of course, trying to compete with Steam a little bit, I think, they're going to start

20:05.240 --> 20:11.360
doing their Games on Demand service starting the beginning of December 15th.

20:11.360 --> 20:18.360
And apparently, some of the games that they're talking about adding for the initial lineup

20:18.360 --> 20:24.040
is going to be Resident Evil 5, Red Faction Guerrilla, Battle Station Specific, as well

20:24.040 --> 20:35.520
as some Game for Windows Live-enabled versions of World of Goo and Osmose.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.840
And I don't know.

20:37.840 --> 20:38.840
That's kind of interesting.

20:38.840 --> 20:43.160
They haven't really set any prices yet on what the games will cost.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.560
Well, I imagine a lot of it's going to be competitively priced or similar to what you

20:46.560 --> 20:48.760
see on store shelves.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.560
That's pretty much what we've come to expect from Steam, but I think a large reason people

20:52.560 --> 20:55.520
really like Steam is that they do sales all the freaking time.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.920
And if I remember correctly, I believe isn't Games for Windows Live kind of tied in with

20:59.920 --> 21:01.400
Windows 7 a little bit?

21:01.400 --> 21:04.360
Because I remember when they were showing us some of the stuff for Windows 7, there

21:04.360 --> 21:08.960
was kind of a game marketplace or whatever that you could download, like a bunch of casual

21:08.960 --> 21:10.200
stuff, and whatnot.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.400
I just upgraded to 7 a week ago.

21:13.400 --> 21:18.660
Well, let me put it this way, I've been running it on my laptop, because remember we got the

21:18.660 --> 21:22.160
release candidate at E3, like many of you out there on the internet downloaded, so I've

21:22.160 --> 21:27.160
been running that on my laptop for some time, ever since I got it in July.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.640
And that's what made me decide that I like Windows 7.

21:29.640 --> 21:33.720
I like it much more than the jump from XP to Vista, because what I liked about 7 is

21:33.720 --> 21:37.840
it takes the best parts of Vista, and what you remember liking about XP, kind of puts

21:37.840 --> 21:38.840
it together.

21:38.840 --> 21:43.040
The one thing I don't like about 7 is I cannot stand these administrator privileges things.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.360
I want to freaking get them removed.

21:45.360 --> 21:46.360
It's the one thing I didn't like.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.360
It's in Vista too.

21:47.360 --> 21:50.280
Yeah, I know, I didn't like it in Vista either.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.780
There should be a way I can disable that crap.

21:51.780 --> 21:52.780
You can disable it.

21:52.780 --> 21:53.780
Can you?

21:53.780 --> 21:57.180
Well, in Vista, all you have to do is make yourself full administrator and then just

21:57.180 --> 22:02.840
do... it took me a while to change it, to find where to change it, but it is there.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.840
They should be there.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.560
To be fair, I haven't looked hard enough, and I'm sure our chat room is going to light

22:06.560 --> 22:09.900
up with comments on things I could be doing better in a minute here, and I'll have to

22:09.900 --> 22:13.120
look into that in the next week, but I was just having problems because it was not letting

22:13.120 --> 22:16.840
me delete World of Warcraft folders because it said I didn't create them, and I had to

22:16.840 --> 22:21.260
go in this really... like I had to right click on the folder, go into properties, make myself

22:21.260 --> 22:22.260
the new owner.

22:22.260 --> 22:23.260
It was ridiculous.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.960
I should just be able to hit the delete key and nuke the fucking folder.

22:25.960 --> 22:29.220
I should not have to jump hurdles to delete my own goddamn game.

22:29.220 --> 22:30.220
You know?

22:30.220 --> 22:31.220
It's stupid.

22:31.220 --> 22:32.220
That's the one drawback.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.720
Windows 7.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.680
And to be fair, Vista has a lot of that administrator pain in the ass too.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.960
So you know what?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.880
Just run Linux Mint, Rob.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.920
I'm not going to run Linux Mint on a desktop.

22:45.920 --> 22:50.640
I'd run it on my laptop, but running that stuff on my desktop, I can't do it.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.000
It will run more efficiently?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
On a laptop?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
No!

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I can't.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
It runs more efficiently?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Why don't you run it on your desktop then?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.400
Because I actually have to have programs that use a Windows environment.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.960
Well, I use a lot of movie makers and stuff like that that's Windows environment.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.140
So you know, that's where I'm coming from.

23:05.140 --> 23:09.240
You know, for a laptop though, like, you know, I kind of like...

23:09.240 --> 23:11.020
Mint 8's out now.

23:11.020 --> 23:14.640
You know, I know you're not a big fan of Google Chrome, but I like where that's headed as

23:14.640 --> 23:17.000
far as a laptop OS goes.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.920
That it's just the internet, the documents, you know, the stuff you want to do on the

23:21.920 --> 23:23.920
go.

23:23.920 --> 23:28.560
But I could never, like, God, Google Chrome, I could never run on a desktop.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.560
Good lord.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.400
I don't think that it's actually meant for desktop use though.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.400
I don't think so either.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.000
But Mint is fairly versatile.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.800
In fact, actually the other thing that I was going to be doing with my computer when the

23:38.800 --> 23:45.560
semester's over is actually doing a second install for Mint 8 because I was going to

23:45.560 --> 23:50.920
run some of the Windows-emulated environments because apparently they actually run pretty

23:50.920 --> 23:56.020
well using less system resource than Vista or Windows 7 does.

23:56.020 --> 24:00.960
So actually all this 5 gigs of RAM I can actually use it for my graphics programs.

24:00.960 --> 24:04.920
You know, I might give it a try.

24:04.920 --> 24:08.000
I am not a fan of Windows.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.300
I use it out of necessity.

24:10.300 --> 24:13.240
And lately I've been even less of a fan of Mac OS.

24:13.240 --> 24:17.520
Yeah, there's things I really, really like about the Mac and there's things I really,

24:17.520 --> 24:18.840
really don't like about the Mac.

24:18.840 --> 24:19.840
Me too.

24:19.840 --> 24:20.840
I know where you're coming from.

24:20.840 --> 24:26.160
Well it's one thing that I've actually been pretty happy that finally Adobe has gotten

24:26.160 --> 24:33.080
their crap together and made CS4 actually really, really wonderfully compatible with

24:33.080 --> 24:34.840
a PC environment.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.200
You know, it's got everything optimized for your graphics cards.

24:37.200 --> 24:44.080
I can run Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Corel Painter and the internet and AIM

24:44.080 --> 24:47.560
and all this other crap at the same time without my system just farting.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.560
Nice.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.560
Alright.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.920
And just another quick note because I see a lot of chatters saying that they're hearing

24:52.920 --> 24:53.920
a lot of typing.

24:53.920 --> 24:57.100
I think something's up with Jamie's mic tonight and it's more sensitive than usual which is

24:57.100 --> 25:00.280
strange because we didn't change any of the dials but you know, things happen when things

25:00.280 --> 25:01.340
get shifted around.

25:01.340 --> 25:03.120
So I think it's just ultra-sensitive tonight.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.520
And I've been typing on the microphone.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
No.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.560
So I'm just saying, we know you guys are hearing it, we just don't know why.

25:09.560 --> 25:14.160
So one of the beauties of live radio is that sometimes we have to figure things out on

25:14.160 --> 25:15.160
the fly.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.160
It's the whole newsroom vibe, okay?

25:16.160 --> 25:17.160
Yes.

25:17.160 --> 25:18.160
It's the typewriter.

25:18.160 --> 25:21.000
Live for the OLR newsroom.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.160
Yeah, we just totally need to have the Morse code ticker going in the background.

25:25.160 --> 25:28.000
Goodnight and have a pleasant tomorrow.

25:28.000 --> 25:35.240
Anyhow, sorry, going back to games for Windows Live because damn, we got on a whole tangent

25:35.240 --> 25:36.240
about Windows 7.

25:36.240 --> 25:40.560
The point I was trying to get to earlier, I've been running Windows 7 for months now

25:40.560 --> 25:42.120
and I haven't seen it.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.520
There was the point I was trying to make seven minutes ago.

25:45.520 --> 25:51.320
Anyway, the other thing I wanted to say, though, about this, Loki, I don't think you really

25:51.320 --> 25:52.880
use any of this stuff.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.440
Do you even have a Steam account?

25:54.440 --> 25:55.440
Nope.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.160
No, I figured, I figured.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.160
Why would you have a Steam account?

25:59.160 --> 26:00.160
Okay.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.160
Why would I pay for software?

26:01.160 --> 26:02.160
I don't know.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.840
Craig, call it supporting developers, maybe?

26:04.840 --> 26:05.840
I don't know.

26:05.840 --> 26:06.840
Call me crazy.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.400
Honestly, I don't play enough PC games to have that.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.400
Fair enough.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.520
The last game I bought, er, I didn't even really...

26:11.520 --> 26:14.760
Final Fantasy XI is the last PC game I remember you, like, actually playing more than like

26:14.760 --> 26:15.760
an hour of.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.520
Uh, I played Crysis and Spore.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.520
Okay.

26:19.520 --> 26:25.360
Spore was, no, actually the last Games for Windows live game that I purchased was Grand

26:25.360 --> 26:27.120
Theft Auto IV for the PC.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.120
Oh, okay.

26:28.120 --> 26:33.400
And I actually stopped playing that because I got tired of trying to monkey with stuff

26:33.400 --> 26:42.760
to get it to, it, I don't know why games nowadays, some of them don't support, you know, multiple

26:42.760 --> 26:48.400
graphics cards and it's really sad that they don't, cause I wasted all that money on another

26:48.400 --> 26:50.920
graphics card for Crysis.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.600
I mean, well, it looks good.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.040
I told you about my Dragon Age issues, right?

26:55.040 --> 26:59.000
Like, it just doesn't run well on my computer at all and I blame the video card, I think

26:59.000 --> 27:02.440
my video card just isn't good enough, even though I bought what I thought was a gaming

27:02.440 --> 27:03.440
computer.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.040
I mean, it wasn't an Alienware or anything like that, which, god no, I'd never buy one

27:06.040 --> 27:07.040
of those.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.040
But, um...

27:08.040 --> 27:09.680
You don't buy computers, you get, you build computers.

27:09.680 --> 27:12.480
I, no, I should have built the god damn computer, but it was eight...

27:12.480 --> 27:16.320
It was eight hundred dollars and I was like, oh, this is a great deal, it's got like six

27:16.320 --> 27:17.320
gigs of RAM, dah, dah, dah.

27:17.320 --> 27:18.320
I'm like, I can't build one that cheap.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.320
Ah, it was stupid.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.320
You can.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.680
It was bad judgment, I admit it.

27:22.680 --> 27:26.760
How dare I doubt the great and mighty Loki and I paid for it every day of my life.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.840
I just built, well, lesson learned.

27:29.840 --> 27:37.320
Now, I just built a PC for my mom, actually, it's sadly almost, well, not quite up to spec

27:37.320 --> 27:41.640
to what mine is, cause mine was built for gaming, but, um, you know, three fifty.

27:41.640 --> 27:46.400
You know, so you, it gets incredibly cheap to do it nowadays and if you actually go piece

27:46.400 --> 27:49.880
by piece of what they actually include in there, you can see where they're cutting corners.

27:49.880 --> 27:54.120
Well, I need a new video card, because Dragon Age kind of runs like balls on my computer,

27:54.120 --> 27:58.120
but then I watched my friend play it on his computer this weekend and it's like, oh, beautiful.

27:58.120 --> 28:02.160
And you can do rotating and things that you can't do on the console, so I'm like, I must

28:02.160 --> 28:06.960
play Dragon Age, this game is beautiful, and I can't, cause my video card is balls, cause

28:06.960 --> 28:07.960
I didn't trust Loki.

28:07.960 --> 28:08.960
Anyhow.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.640
Well, that'd be the last time that you'd do that.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.440
Well, clearly there's not a lot of good news this week.

28:15.440 --> 28:19.320
One of our favorite people in the video game industry, one of our very favorite people,

28:19.320 --> 28:24.080
and I don't think Jamie or Loki would disagree with me here, Akira Yamaoka.

28:24.080 --> 28:29.360
Akira Yamaoka, of course, the producer of Silent Hill, also for long time Bamani fans,

28:29.360 --> 28:32.840
he's been a composer for songs in the series for years and years.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.760
He has left Konami.

28:34.760 --> 28:38.520
After a sixteen year relationship with Konami, he has left.

28:38.520 --> 28:46.000
And no word as to why, of course, but I gotta be honest, without him at Konami, Silent Hill's

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
dead to me.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.320
I mean, I don't see how they could do another Silent Hill game without his soundtracks.

28:52.320 --> 28:58.220
They'll probably try, just like they outsourced it, or not outsourced it, but had a US developer

28:58.220 --> 29:01.520
do Homecoming or what have you, and I don't know, maybe that's part of what ticked him

29:01.520 --> 29:02.520
off.

29:02.520 --> 29:03.520
I have no idea.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.520
Or maybe, you know, after sixteen years you want a new job.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.760
That he just doesn't get along with people, from what I understand.

29:06.760 --> 29:07.760
Really?

29:07.760 --> 29:10.920
He was nice, he was nice at E3 that one year we randomly met him.

29:10.920 --> 29:15.120
Yeah, he was pretty cool, and I mean, I was like, hahaha!

29:15.120 --> 29:23.640
But anyway, but seriously, I just, I, you know, maybe he just got tired of dealing with

29:23.640 --> 29:25.440
all the crap going on.

29:25.440 --> 29:28.600
And we don't know, we can speculate until the cows come home, but we don't know.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.120
There's been no official statement made.

29:30.120 --> 29:33.600
But you also look at it and go, okay, he was there for what, sixteen years?

29:33.600 --> 29:36.320
I mean, that's a long time to be at any job.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.360
And you know, sometimes people just want to change.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.440
Maybe he's doing that whole thing where it's like, okay, I've been with this band and now

29:42.440 --> 29:44.920
I want to split off and make a solo album.

29:44.920 --> 29:48.860
You know, and kind of secretly, that's what I hope happens, is that he goes off and makes

29:48.860 --> 29:53.840
a new studio and maybe makes a new Silent Hill-esque kind of game, because I would be

29:53.840 --> 29:58.840
all over that, because Akira Yamoko is a great, great composer, and just, not just the Silent

29:58.840 --> 30:03.080
Hill works, but a lot of the stuff he contributed to, BeatMania, 2DX, and DDR over the years

30:03.080 --> 30:04.760
was fantastic.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.320
And he scored things even all the way back to the 8-bit days.

30:07.320 --> 30:11.920
I know he did the Contra game that was on, he did some of Super Contra's soundtrack,

30:11.920 --> 30:12.920
I think.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.160
He's just done a lot of stuff over the years.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.120
I'm sure the wiki has the whole list about that.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.840
So, we wish him the best!

30:18.840 --> 30:23.840
Good luck to Akira Yamoko, and again, we would really like to see you form a new studio and

30:23.840 --> 30:25.000
make some more scary games.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.600
He should hire me.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.600
He should.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
He should.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
He should hire me, too.

30:29.600 --> 30:34.200
I am particularly crazy enough to be able to help with the whole Silent Hill... anyway.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.040
You just want to be raped by Pyramid Head.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.680
No!

30:38.680 --> 30:40.440
No!

30:40.440 --> 30:44.360
Not just no, but no!

30:44.360 --> 30:45.720
Ew!

30:45.720 --> 30:50.200
One does not just ask Pyramid Head to rape them.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.200
Besides that, he has-

30:51.200 --> 30:52.640
You have to be chosen by Pyramid Head.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.720
Besides that, he only bones the monsters.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.760
Ah, I see.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.320
I'm not a nurse, sorry.

31:00.320 --> 31:04.440
Well, how about some game banning... or not?

31:04.440 --> 31:05.440
This is stupid.

31:05.440 --> 31:12.320
Um, yeah, so the Australian classification board says that Sega can't have it for aliens

31:12.320 --> 31:15.600
versus predators, so that means that they actually cannot sell it in Australia the way

31:15.600 --> 31:16.600
it is now.

31:16.600 --> 31:24.200
That, um, it's... they're saying that because you've got human beings being tortured and

31:24.200 --> 31:32.440
violated and decapitated and dismembered and lots of stabbing through different parts of

31:32.440 --> 31:35.440
the body that, um, that no.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.620
They said no.

31:36.620 --> 31:42.280
And Sega Australia is like, um, we're gonna still appeal it, because this is kind of stupid.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.680
Well, and that's just what you do when your game gets a bad rating.

31:45.680 --> 31:49.720
I mean, have we ever heard a game company ever in the history of this show, you know,

31:49.720 --> 31:55.520
this is why game gets banned, and the company says, ah, okay, well, you know, these things

31:55.520 --> 31:56.520
happen.

31:56.520 --> 31:57.520
Well, we tried.

31:57.520 --> 31:58.520
That's right.

31:58.520 --> 31:59.520
Nope, cancel it, you know.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.520
Merry Christmas to you now.

32:00.520 --> 32:01.520
Oh well.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.520
Oh well.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.520
Happy Christmas.

32:03.520 --> 32:11.120
Well, for example, um, you know, they could edit it, but since Germany had, um, problems

32:11.120 --> 32:17.480
with AVP that, um, they actually decided not to release it in Germany, so that they wouldn't

32:17.480 --> 32:22.380
have to, uh, compromise the, uh, integrity of the game.

32:22.380 --> 32:24.440
That's a ballsy thing to do.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.640
Yeah.

32:25.640 --> 32:29.200
You know, one thing I, uh, got to see this week was the Left 4 Dead, you know, it's on

32:29.200 --> 32:30.200
YouTube.

32:30.200 --> 32:34.600
If you go look for the Left 4 Dead 2, you can look at the censored version in Australia

32:34.600 --> 32:39.800
and kind of compare it to the regular one, and, man, you guys in Australia got shafted

32:39.800 --> 32:44.040
on Left 4 Dead 2, it's, it's, like, the zombies, like, disappear.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.800
Like I was waiting for the bodies to flicker before they disappear like it was Double Dragon

32:47.800 --> 32:48.800
or something.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.560
I mean, it was, it was not pleasant how desanitized they had to make that game.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.560
It's, it's unfortunate.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.620
So do you still want to...

32:55.620 --> 32:59.880
It's like, the dingo ate my decapitated, decapitation scenes, you know, it's sad.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.440
Do you still want to go over there?

33:01.440 --> 33:02.440
What, to Australia?

33:02.440 --> 33:03.440
Yeah.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.440
Well, I want to go visit.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.440
But you don't want to live there.

33:05.440 --> 33:08.960
That's because I have an unhealthy obsession with a lot of Australian movies over the years,

33:08.960 --> 33:13.440
but, you know, and I want, I want to see somebody play a didgeridoo.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.240
Did I tell you I saw someone play a didgeridoo at school?

33:16.240 --> 33:18.040
It's not authentic if it's not in Australia.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.040
No.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.040
But he...

33:20.040 --> 33:22.200
Just like if you have a pineapple here, it's not the same as having a pineapple in Hawaii.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.200
I'm sorry.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.560
But he, he built it out of PVC pipe.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.560
That's not a didgeridoo!

33:27.560 --> 33:28.560
That's...

33:28.560 --> 33:31.720
But it sounded, it sounded right, and the guy was sitting outside at school...

33:31.720 --> 33:33.720
That's a PVCeridoo or something.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.720
Playing a PV...

33:34.720 --> 33:35.720
PVCeridoo.

33:35.720 --> 33:36.720
Didgeridoo.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.720
I took a picture of it, too.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.720
It was funny.

33:41.720 --> 33:46.760
Well, look, people, you know what, if this game comes out on PC, which almost all these

33:46.760 --> 33:51.040
games do nowadays, what's going to stop them from just importing the PC version of the

33:51.040 --> 33:52.040
game?

33:52.040 --> 33:54.160
I mean, they don't, do they region lockout PC games?

33:54.160 --> 33:56.160
I don't think that's a very easy thing to do.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.160
No, you can't.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.160
You can't, really.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.160
There is no regions.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.160
You can if it runs on a DVD.

34:00.160 --> 34:02.480
Oh, I guess that makes sense.

34:02.480 --> 34:03.480
But isn't Australia?

34:03.480 --> 34:04.480
That's a...

34:04.480 --> 34:06.400
Australia's on the same region as Britain, though, right?

34:06.400 --> 34:07.400
You can't, no.

34:07.400 --> 34:13.240
If it's on DVD, DVD video only has regions, DVD software does not have regions at all.

34:13.240 --> 34:16.240
So there's no way to lockout anything.

34:16.240 --> 34:19.880
I guess maybe because we're thinking PS2 would do the region lockouts, but of course that's

34:19.880 --> 34:20.880
different.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.880
Interesting.

34:21.880 --> 34:28.080
Yeah, and even if they did, it would just get bypassed so easy it's not even worth it.

34:28.080 --> 34:31.320
Somebody in the chatroom, of course, made the reference to Didgeridoo Techno.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.880
I was an inside joke on this show from a year and a half ago, but maybe we'll have to play

34:34.880 --> 34:36.320
that on break tonight.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.320
It's been a little while.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.720
Don't forget the references to Kylie.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.120
We haven't had Didgeridoo Techno in a while.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.840
You should play some Kylie during the break.

34:41.840 --> 34:42.840
We'll see.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.840
I have...

34:43.840 --> 34:47.560
Well, I had an old school chiptune song all picked out, but we'll see.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.560
We'll see.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.080
Anyhow, we gotta move on with more news.

34:51.080 --> 34:58.120
Sorry Australia, you should write your legislators and tell them they're crap.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.660
I don't really know what else you can do.

34:59.660 --> 35:00.660
These are your elected officials.

35:00.660 --> 35:01.660
There he is.

35:01.660 --> 35:02.660
Someone actually put a...

35:02.660 --> 35:07.400
I swear, someone had to do some hunting to go through my Twitter.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.240
Wait, wait, wait.

35:09.240 --> 35:13.840
Did somebody dig up the PVC redo and post it in our chatroom?

35:13.840 --> 35:16.640
That's the picture that I posted on Twitter.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.640
I'm kind of...

35:17.640 --> 35:18.640
The OL Army knows how to stop.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.900
That I took out of the window of my car.

35:20.900 --> 35:23.520
So you see that blue light over there in that building?

35:23.520 --> 35:24.920
There's the ARC Art Department.

35:24.920 --> 35:25.920
Ew.

35:25.920 --> 35:26.920
I wouldn't tell them that.

35:26.920 --> 35:27.920
One of these days...

35:27.920 --> 35:29.200
Give them money.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.680
Tigerclaw's gonna show up there.

35:32.680 --> 35:33.680
Just messin'.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.680
Alright, sorry Logie.

35:35.680 --> 35:36.680
Yes.

35:36.680 --> 35:44.560
So there's a rumor that by the end of the year actually, or I guess near future, you're

35:44.560 --> 35:50.120
gonna be able to play your PSP minis on your PlayStation 3.

35:50.120 --> 35:53.080
So there's basically kind of...

35:53.080 --> 35:54.960
I don't know, you can look at it two ways.

35:54.960 --> 36:01.920
One, they're allowing more customers to purchase these PSP minis, which is neat that they would

36:01.920 --> 36:04.200
allow you to be able to play it.

36:04.200 --> 36:09.200
Two, they don't have very much confidence in the PlayStation Portable platform in order

36:09.200 --> 36:13.480
to put out these PSP minis.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.900
They are afraid that they're not gonna sell that well.

36:15.900 --> 36:19.920
So I don't know, I think it's good that they'll have more content on the PlayStation Network

36:19.920 --> 36:25.920
because it's kind of bare sometimes as far as new stuff goes.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.480
Now why do you think that the PSP minis are a failure?

36:29.480 --> 36:30.480
So far.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.480
I guess I shouldn't...

36:31.480 --> 36:37.000
Maybe failure is a strong word, but why do you think the PSP minis are not up to expectations

36:37.000 --> 36:39.320
right now?

36:39.320 --> 36:44.680
Maybe because the PlayStation Portable, I mean, the PSP goes, I mean, obviously you're

36:44.680 --> 36:46.700
all digital.

36:46.700 --> 36:53.120
Most people with PSPs probably aren't really interested in download games, whereas they're

36:53.120 --> 36:56.720
more interested in kind of the retail stuff, because that way if they don't like it, they

36:56.720 --> 37:02.760
can send it back, or they can rent it, or they can try it out, and that kind of stuff.

37:02.760 --> 37:09.080
And maybe just some of these games like, you know, Tetris they put out there, I mean, who

37:09.080 --> 37:10.880
hasn't played Tetris, and really do...

37:10.880 --> 37:15.040
Okay, let me, here's one reason why the PSP minis, here's my proof on why the PSP minis

37:15.040 --> 37:16.040
is doing well.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.480
Here's the game you can play along with at home.

37:17.480 --> 37:18.480
You ready?

37:18.480 --> 37:19.480
Okay.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.480
Quick.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.360
Name one PSP minigame that's been released that wasn't Sudoku Tetris.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.360
Ready?

37:24.360 --> 37:25.360
Go!

37:25.360 --> 37:26.360
I don't know!

37:26.360 --> 37:27.360
Oh!

37:27.360 --> 37:32.240
That's why they're not doing well, because there's nothing of note!

37:32.240 --> 37:36.120
I'm sure there are, but I just don't know what they are, and they don't advertise them

37:36.120 --> 37:37.360
very well either.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.360
Bingo.

37:38.360 --> 37:45.800
I've seen more advertisement for the XNA lacrosse game than I have for these PSP minis.

37:45.800 --> 37:50.560
I've got to mention this that's come up in our chat, because it's not on the show roll

37:50.560 --> 37:53.200
tonight, but it's something I have to bring up, because I really want to hear what Loki

37:53.200 --> 37:54.440
has to say to this.

37:54.440 --> 37:59.040
SalaciousPopInChat says, there was some sort of Logitech rumor this week about them considering

37:59.040 --> 38:03.200
making a UMD add-on for the go.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.760
And they already denied it.

38:04.760 --> 38:05.760
Have they denied it?

38:05.760 --> 38:06.760
Yeah.

38:06.760 --> 38:12.080
But let's imagine, let's go to the land of make-believe, okay, with King Friday and everybody

38:12.080 --> 38:16.400
for a minute, and imagine that this rumor were true.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.400
What would you be saying?

38:17.400 --> 38:20.840
That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.

38:20.840 --> 38:27.240
Yes, let me buy a more expensive system that's like almost $100 more expensive than the actual

38:27.240 --> 38:32.440
normal system, which includes this peripheral, and then buy an additional peripheral to be

38:32.440 --> 38:36.360
able to have the same features as the cheaper system.

38:36.360 --> 38:40.120
So you're asking me to spend more money for the system initially, and more money on top

38:40.120 --> 38:43.520
of that to buy a feature that should have been in there in the first place.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.320
Sure, sign me up.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.320
But yes.

38:46.320 --> 38:52.240
My reply to that would be, but meow meow this.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.600
I see what you did there.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.600
Yes, you did.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.920
And like half of our listeners aren't even going to get it because they didn't watch

38:56.920 --> 38:57.920
Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.

38:57.920 --> 38:58.920
No, plenty more.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.720
Not going to understand what you just did, but I laughed very hard.

39:01.720 --> 39:02.720
All right.

39:02.720 --> 39:03.720
Rob, that was for your benefit.

39:03.720 --> 39:04.720
Thank you.

39:04.720 --> 39:05.720
I appreciate it.

39:05.720 --> 39:06.720
And Rob, I think that's so meow meow stupid.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.840
I think this show should simply exist to amuse me.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.840
Otherwise what the hell are we doing?

39:10.840 --> 39:11.840
Exactly.

39:11.840 --> 39:12.840
We're just wasting our goddamn time.

39:12.840 --> 39:15.560
We do this show every week so you can bring me coffee.

39:15.560 --> 39:24.320
I was hoping that Logitech rumor was true, because it would just be the nice bullet point

39:24.320 --> 39:27.040
to the failure of the PSB Go.

39:27.040 --> 39:32.320
And there's the ribbon for the package of failure right there.

39:32.320 --> 39:36.800
And that's what they should call the add-on, Logitech Package of Failure for the PSB Go.

39:36.800 --> 39:41.840
Well, you already spent the money already, so apparently you're going to buy extra crap

39:41.840 --> 39:42.840
for it as well.

39:42.840 --> 39:43.840
Sure, why not?

39:43.840 --> 39:44.840
Meow meow fail.

39:44.840 --> 39:49.800
You know what, there's actually, I just realized, there's a UMD movie I have that I do not have

39:49.800 --> 39:51.400
on DVD otherwise.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.400
Shallon Soccer.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
No, it's good.

39:53.400 --> 39:59.800
I didn't know how to respond to that, what do you want me to say?

39:59.800 --> 40:04.680
So that means that I actually would have a reason to have a UMD add-on, except that I

40:04.680 --> 40:08.040
have an old PSP and didn't bother buying the damn Go.

40:08.040 --> 40:13.800
Or you could just, I don't know, give up on the UMD format as a format for movies, since

40:13.800 --> 40:16.400
they've stopped making them anyways.

40:16.400 --> 40:22.080
I don't know, I never really saw any reason to, because I already have that on laserdiscs

40:22.080 --> 40:23.080
somewhere.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.600
And you know what, you know why the PSP Minis suck?

40:25.600 --> 40:29.160
It's because they've already had the PSP download games already.

40:29.160 --> 40:33.920
There was absolutely no need to add PSP Minis as another form of download game.

40:33.920 --> 40:37.040
Well I like the idea of cheaper games, just so we don't have anything of note.

40:37.040 --> 40:42.400
Now to be fair, Sony needs time to grow.

40:42.400 --> 40:46.400
It's not a chia pet, it doesn't grow in seven days, it's a little more of a redwood tree

40:46.400 --> 40:49.320
that takes hundreds of years to grow to its full potential.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.540
That's what Sony is right now.

40:51.540 --> 40:55.040
I think in about a year's time we'll have those PSP Minis that are worth it and we'll

40:55.040 --> 40:58.000
be liking it a lot more because they're like, ooh, cheap games that are notable.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.300
But right now, I got nothing.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.640
You know, there's just nothing very of note.

41:04.640 --> 41:11.400
And I do feel bad for the Sony fan, well no I don't, but you know, we habitually bash

41:11.400 --> 41:17.520
the PSP Go on this show, but honestly, Sony, it's just time to give the PSP Go an abortion.

41:17.520 --> 41:21.600
I realize it's already out of the womb, but just stuff it in the face with a pillow and

41:21.600 --> 41:23.340
end the PSP Go.

41:23.340 --> 41:24.760
Because the PSP is a great system.

41:24.760 --> 41:30.880
Go back to the 3,000, it's great, PSP is great, it's internet, MP3s, movies, all right there,

41:30.880 --> 41:31.880
it's great.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.440
Stop it with the Go.

41:33.440 --> 41:34.440
Stop it.

41:34.440 --> 41:39.480
And it wouldn't have been that hard to, I mean seriously, all they would've had to do

41:39.480 --> 41:44.520
is make a PSP 4,000 or whatever and have internal storage built into it.

41:44.520 --> 41:51.160
So okay, look, we've got an internal drive and all the same features that you liked before.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.160
And that would've been just fine.

41:52.160 --> 41:54.820
Brad from Pop Culture asked an interesting question in chat.

41:54.820 --> 41:58.960
How is the add-on any different than a cart adapter for the GameCube or SNES?

41:58.960 --> 42:02.920
Well, in both those cases, you were taking portable systems and putting them on your

42:02.920 --> 42:03.960
TV.

42:03.960 --> 42:06.080
And I think that was the point of those.

42:06.080 --> 42:12.260
Whereas this Logitech adapter is taking something that they took away and putting it back because

42:12.260 --> 42:16.000
you realized it never should've been gone in the first place, if that makes any sense.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
I don't know.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
It's sort of like...

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
I think that's the difference to me.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.280
And to be fair, those other adapters on the GameCube were a little silly as well, although

42:23.280 --> 42:29.680
the Super Game Boy did let you tweak the colors, silly, superficial things that weren't there

42:29.680 --> 42:30.680
to begin with.

42:30.680 --> 42:33.520
At least something.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.520
But at least...

42:34.520 --> 42:36.320
I don't know.

42:36.320 --> 42:43.360
It's sort of like the HD DVD add-on to the Xbox 360.

42:43.360 --> 42:47.640
Something that they could've put in at launch, but they didn't.

42:47.640 --> 42:49.840
And no one's missing it now.

42:49.840 --> 42:50.840
We'll see.

42:50.840 --> 42:55.240
I mean, maybe, again, in a year's time, we'll be singing a different tune, but I still think

42:55.240 --> 42:56.480
the PSP Go by that time will be...

42:56.480 --> 42:58.760
I think if they'd literally put this out...

42:58.760 --> 43:02.080
First off, it would've been Sony putting this out, not Logitech.

43:02.080 --> 43:06.360
Although I can see why they do Logitech, so that way they wouldn't look as bad.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.400
It would still be bad enough.

43:08.400 --> 43:12.080
And right there, it's just like, oh, look, you don't have confidence in your system.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.560
And how the hell would they manage to hack that?

43:14.560 --> 43:20.540
And let's just say, for argument's sake, they were able to, I don't know, make that

43:20.540 --> 43:24.880
device and have it connect to their memory card slot or something like that to read UMDs.

43:24.880 --> 43:31.120
It would be hacked in seconds, and it would be a big old back door to the whole PSP Go.

43:31.120 --> 43:38.360
It's not gonna end up pretty for them, which is why they need to do it, so that people

43:38.360 --> 43:40.720
can hack the Go even easier.

43:40.720 --> 43:43.240
All right, let's move on, guys.

43:43.240 --> 43:47.520
We gotta keep moving on with the gaming news so we can get to a break here at some point.

43:47.520 --> 43:50.360
And we're gonna move on to Xbox Live Arcade, looking at what's going on with Microsoft

43:50.360 --> 43:51.360
a little bit.

43:51.360 --> 43:55.400
It looks like the new game that will be coming out this week, Kix++, because it's coming

43:55.400 --> 44:00.320
out on December 9th in Japan, can't imagine that it would be much further behind here.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.120
If you've never played Kix before, it's pretty cool.

44:02.120 --> 44:06.320
I wanna say Dark Sakura had it as their game of the week once, maybe like a year ago.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.480
I am sure I did, because I love Kix.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.480
I do too.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.320
It's one of my favorite puzzler games.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.160
And if you haven't played this, well, you've probably played Gals Panic, and it's pretty

44:14.160 --> 44:15.480
much the same thing.

44:15.480 --> 44:19.120
But if, for whatever reason, you somehow still have not played either one, then it's like

44:19.120 --> 44:21.460
Miss Nude World 96.

44:21.460 --> 44:25.360
And if you haven't played any of those, you draw these little lines and make boxes, and

44:25.360 --> 44:27.520
you're trying to fill a certain percentage of the screen.

44:27.520 --> 44:30.720
I know this game's been cloned several times, you've probably seen something like it.

44:30.720 --> 44:34.840
So it's no surprise that a version of this will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

44:34.840 --> 44:35.840
I don't know if it...

44:35.840 --> 44:39.720
You know, all I've seen of this is a screenshot, so I don't know if it has, like...

44:39.720 --> 44:41.880
Although it looks a little...

44:41.880 --> 44:46.480
It looks a little Q Entertainment-y, meaning that it looks like it might have, like, flashing

44:46.480 --> 44:48.560
lights and techno music and all that stuff.

44:48.560 --> 44:53.480
I have no idea what to expect, but apparently it's coming out December 9th in Japan at 800

44:53.480 --> 44:54.480
Microsoft points.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.960
A release here honestly cannot be that far behind.

44:56.960 --> 45:02.280
We might even be getting it at the same time, who knows yet, but most certainly before Christmas.

45:02.280 --> 45:06.600
And I know Jamie's probably all over that, assuming it doesn't suck.

45:06.600 --> 45:07.600
Although it looks like...

45:07.600 --> 45:08.600
It looks like it might be fun.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.000
It looks like it's, like, four players.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.700
That could be kind of chaotic.

45:11.700 --> 45:14.400
If four players are going at the grid all at once, that could be interesting.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.400
That could be.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.400
To see how...

45:16.400 --> 45:19.720
Probably it's a big thing, it probably has, like, online, everybody kind of attacks it

45:19.720 --> 45:20.720
all at once.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.880
It could be cool.

45:22.880 --> 45:27.600
Well, how about something that we kind of already knew?

45:27.600 --> 45:28.600
Hmm.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
Yeah.

45:29.600 --> 45:34.000
So, you know the rumor was going along for a long time that a lot of the music in Sonic

45:34.000 --> 45:38.160
3 had been done by Michael Jackson?

45:38.160 --> 45:43.880
Yes, I've heard that rumor before, because the credits music sounds like Stranger in

45:43.880 --> 45:44.880
Moscow, right?

45:44.880 --> 45:46.200
And Casino Night from Scream?

45:46.200 --> 45:47.200
Mm-hmm.

45:47.200 --> 45:48.200
The same...

45:48.200 --> 45:49.200
Ah, that's right.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.200
Yeah.

45:50.200 --> 45:51.200
The little triplet part.

45:51.200 --> 45:52.200
But anyway, yeah.

45:52.200 --> 45:56.280
So it was confirmed that he did it, but he was not happy with it, so he wanted himself

45:56.280 --> 45:58.400
uncredited in the music altered.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.400
Mm-hmm.

45:59.400 --> 46:03.920
So, but he, of course, kept a lot of the same elements to use in his own music.

46:03.920 --> 46:07.360
That's kind of a bummer for Sega, because imagine if they could have marketed that Sonic

46:07.360 --> 46:10.080
3 had a Michael freaking Jackson soundtrack.

46:10.080 --> 46:12.160
I mean, that would have been huge for them.

46:12.160 --> 46:17.000
I mean, it's not like Sonic 3 was a little game anyway, but there'd be a lot of people

46:17.000 --> 46:19.760
that would have taken a huge interest in this game, knowing that Michael Jackson had been

46:19.760 --> 46:20.760
involved.

46:20.760 --> 46:27.400
But there's also, I actually remembered there being interviews ahead of time that they said

46:27.400 --> 46:33.040
that they were getting Michael Jackson's involvement for the musical direction on one of the games.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.040
Mm-hmm.

46:34.040 --> 46:39.560
And, because, I mean, that was in a magazine back when.

46:39.560 --> 46:48.880
But the whole point was that, and this is a quote from, actually an interview with Michael

46:48.880 --> 46:54.960
Jackson's composer, Brad Buxer, saying that at the time, this is a quote, at the time

46:54.960 --> 47:01.120
game consoles did not allow optimal sound reproduction, and Michael found it frustrating.

47:01.120 --> 47:04.120
He did not want to be associated with a product that devalued his music.

47:04.120 --> 47:07.640
So what about Moonwalker, huh?

47:07.640 --> 47:11.040
Well, Moonwalker was kind of a rat in the arcades.

47:11.040 --> 47:15.480
I mean, at the time, now you look back and you go, this is something better left in my

47:15.480 --> 47:16.480
memory.

47:16.480 --> 47:17.480
It came out on Genesis?

47:17.480 --> 47:18.480
That's true.

47:18.480 --> 47:21.240
I thought a pretty good rendition of Smooth Criminal.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.200
Now, Salacious Pop was thinking what I was thinking.

47:23.200 --> 47:26.000
At least there's always Space Channel 5 with Space Michael, right?

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Space Channel 5.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Mm-hmm.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.080
By the way, have you ever heard this, and I think this is the right YouTube.

47:30.080 --> 47:32.440
I came across this earlier this week when I was reading about the story.

47:32.440 --> 47:34.240
I've actually got one that I can link you.

47:34.240 --> 47:35.240
Do you?

47:35.240 --> 47:36.240
Okay.

47:36.240 --> 47:40.280
This is a hybrid one that's actually the credits and Michael Jackson's Stranger in Moscow over

47:40.280 --> 47:41.280
each other.

47:41.280 --> 47:42.280
I'll play a little clip of this here.

47:42.280 --> 48:00.160
Yes, I have heard that.

48:00.160 --> 48:05.000
By the way, I do think the Sonic 3 credit music is some of the best video game music

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
from that era.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.080
So, it is pretty neat to know that Michael Jackson indeed had something to do with that.

48:11.080 --> 48:15.240
So, oh yeah, the Ice Cap Zone thing, huh?

48:15.240 --> 48:16.240
I'm gonna link it to you right now.

48:16.240 --> 48:22.000
All right, let's try to get this played here and then we'll move on with another story.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.800
In fact, while I load that up, maybe we'll start moving into release dates this week.

48:26.800 --> 48:30.560
Loki, why don't you start off with the US releases and then we'll come back to this.

48:30.560 --> 48:33.320
This week's not a lot coming out.

48:33.320 --> 48:39.560
Pretty much your big game's gonna be The Saboteur coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and

48:39.560 --> 48:41.520
PC.

48:41.520 --> 48:47.400
Also this week, though, we do have one, I guess, well, apparently now one of the last

48:47.400 --> 48:52.180
Akira Yamaka Silent Hill games, Silent Hill Shattered Memories coming out on the Wii this

48:52.180 --> 48:54.180
week.

48:54.180 --> 48:55.880
I have to pick that up.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.080
I really like that at E3.

48:57.080 --> 48:58.080
I hope it doesn't disappoint.

48:58.080 --> 49:01.040
No, it looks freaking awesome, so, you know.

49:01.040 --> 49:03.240
Yeah, well, Nintendogs looked awesome, too.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.240
That's all I'm saying.

49:04.240 --> 49:08.600
Yeah, but Nintendogs was awesome, it's just, unfortunately, we didn't get to play it longer

49:08.600 --> 49:14.400
than five minutes at, you know, E3, so, eh, you know, we thought it was good for longer

49:14.400 --> 49:17.680
than five, but, really, it was only good for five.

49:17.680 --> 49:24.840
Of course, this week, Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on the DS, and then there's some small

49:24.840 --> 49:27.920
crap that's kind of littering the rest of the week.

49:27.920 --> 49:37.600
Wreck Room for the Wii, Puzzler World for the DS, which is a puzzle minigame compilation,

49:37.600 --> 49:42.800
James Cameron's Avatar the Game, out on PSP, because I believe it's delayed from the rest

49:42.800 --> 49:50.440
of them, and that's about it, actually.

49:50.440 --> 49:54.800
Alright, let me go back to those YouTubes real quick before I get into the Japanese

49:54.800 --> 49:55.800
releases.

49:55.800 --> 49:59.840
Maybe, who is it mixed with Ice Cap Zone music?

49:59.840 --> 50:00.840
Yeah.

50:00.840 --> 50:05.040
Oops, I still have my wave muted.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.040
Live radio fail.

50:07.040 --> 50:20.440
Something's out of tune with that.

50:20.440 --> 50:22.160
I think they were just doing it to sync it.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.120
They need Timbaland to get it auto-tuned.

50:24.120 --> 50:25.560
That's what they need, and then it would be fine.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.000
They were syncing it.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
That's the whole thing.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
I get it.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Alright.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
I know it was jam, not scream.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
Jam mixed with Carnival Night Zone.

50:36.000 --> 50:47.480
Dude, I like this.

50:47.480 --> 50:50.920
It's kind of neat.

50:50.920 --> 50:53.880
It's so cool now that that game just has so much added value.

50:53.880 --> 50:56.680
Even though this is one of those things everybody always suspected anyway, but I think a lot

50:56.680 --> 51:00.840
of people were like, did Michael Jackson rip off Sonic because it was one of his favorite

51:00.840 --> 51:01.840
movies?

51:01.840 --> 51:02.840
But now it's like, no.

51:02.840 --> 51:03.840
He fucking wrote it.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.920
He just took the stuff he already did.

51:05.920 --> 51:06.920
Yeah.

51:06.920 --> 51:07.920
I think it's amazing.

51:07.920 --> 51:11.360
A couple more things I was going to mention real quick for release dates, even though

51:11.360 --> 51:16.520
it's not next week, but there's a couple of the Konami Classic volumes that are coming

51:16.520 --> 51:22.840
out on Xbox 360 for 20 bucks each, and actually there's a couple that are pretty good deals.

51:22.840 --> 51:26.240
The first one is... Are these just like the live arcade games?

51:26.240 --> 51:27.240
These are live arcade games.

51:27.240 --> 51:28.240
Like what PopCap does.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.240
That's pretty sweet.

51:29.240 --> 51:32.880
They've got Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, Frogger, and Super Contra.

51:32.880 --> 51:33.880
That's for 20 bucks.

51:33.880 --> 51:39.760
The other one that they have is Track and Field, Rush and Attack, and Contra.

51:39.760 --> 51:42.560
Rush and Attack, by the way, I bet is one of those arcade games you probably didn't

51:42.560 --> 51:43.560
play growing up.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.900
At least I didn't, but it was actually a lot of fun on Xbox Live Arcade.

51:46.900 --> 51:47.900
For five bucks.

51:47.900 --> 51:48.900
It wasn't a bad deal.

51:48.900 --> 51:49.900
Anyhow.

51:49.900 --> 51:51.080
So that's what they're available for now.

51:51.080 --> 51:54.680
I'm not sure if they've dropped the price enough to where that's actually not a good

51:54.680 --> 51:57.800
deal anymore, but maybe three games for 20 bucks.

51:57.800 --> 52:00.040
Let's go to Japan and look at the releases over there.

52:00.040 --> 52:03.280
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 gets released in Japan this week, obviously.

52:03.280 --> 52:06.320
Not quite as big of a deal there as it was here, but certainly the game is going to have

52:06.320 --> 52:08.360
its fans over there, just like it does here.

52:08.360 --> 52:12.040
That is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, and they're even getting their own

52:12.040 --> 52:15.800
Xbox 360 Elite version of it, just like we had here.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.600
Samurai Spirits Zen comes out on the 360 as well.

52:18.600 --> 52:22.600
If I'm not mistaken, Samurai Spirits is Samurai Shodown over here, correct?

52:22.600 --> 52:26.960
So yeah, it's from SNK, so that is getting released on the 360 this week.

52:26.960 --> 52:29.280
Some fighting game fans are going to be very happy about that.

52:29.280 --> 52:32.060
I know that series has its fans.

52:32.060 --> 52:37.760
Also on PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is out over there as well, as well

52:37.760 --> 52:40.800
as X-Edge or Cross Edge.

52:40.800 --> 52:45.320
Of course, next week is Final Fantasy 13, and I know a lot of you over here in America

52:45.320 --> 52:48.600
are going to be importing that, although if you just wait 4 more months, you'll have it

52:48.600 --> 52:50.240
here soon enough.

52:50.240 --> 52:55.600
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Tales of Graces, and it's also, I guess, a big enough game

52:55.600 --> 53:00.820
where it's getting a bundle release as well, because it's a Tales of game, but now it's

53:00.820 --> 53:01.820
on the Wii.

53:01.820 --> 53:04.840
Like, you know, Tales of Symphonia and all these other titles, now it's Tales of Graces

53:04.840 --> 53:06.800
coming out on the Wii this week in Japan.

53:06.800 --> 53:10.760
Also Toushinden coming out in Japan this week as well.

53:10.760 --> 53:11.760
On the Nintendo Wii.

53:11.760 --> 53:12.760
No way.

53:12.760 --> 53:13.760
Way.

53:13.760 --> 53:18.840
Man, I remember playing Toushinden 3 on PlayStation.

53:18.840 --> 53:19.840
There it is.

53:19.840 --> 53:20.840
Now you get a version on the Nintendo Wii.

53:20.840 --> 53:23.200
I don't know if it's a ported version of the game or what it is.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.200
Oh no, it's a redo.

53:24.200 --> 53:27.320
Actually, you know, I remembered seeing the trailer for it.

53:27.320 --> 53:28.320
Yeah?

53:28.320 --> 53:29.960
Yeah, and it looked just as crappy as all the other ones, which means I have to play

53:29.960 --> 53:30.960
it.

53:30.960 --> 53:34.520
Um, PlayStation 2, you know, the releases are dying down over there in Japan just like

53:34.520 --> 53:38.520
they are over here, but I do want to point out World Soccer winning 11 2010 is coming

53:38.520 --> 53:40.680
out in Japan for you soccer fans.

53:40.680 --> 53:48.560
Nintendo DS, Luminous Arc 3 comes out on the DS this week, and lastly on the PSP, Bleach

53:48.560 --> 53:54.600
Soul Carnival 2 makes its way out in Japan as well as yet another Naruto game, Naruto

53:54.600 --> 53:59.200
Shippuden Narutamit Excel 3.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.200
And World Soccer winning 11.

54:00.200 --> 54:01.200
Woohoo.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.200
On PSP.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.680
There you have it for Japanese releases.

54:03.680 --> 54:08.000
Well, we've got just a few notable ones for the UK.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.920
On the 10th, Pixel Junk Shooter on PlayStation 3, and then on the 11th we have Tekken 6 on

54:13.920 --> 54:18.720
PSP and The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on DS.

54:18.720 --> 54:19.720
Very cool.

54:19.720 --> 54:24.680
All right, so, back to some more gaming news then, and then we're going to get into the

54:24.680 --> 54:28.400
Classic Game of the Week before too long here, and of course our Part B in just a little

54:28.400 --> 54:29.400
while.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.400
Mm-hmm.

54:30.400 --> 54:33.480
Um, this is kind of cool.

54:33.480 --> 54:39.560
They've got, you may remember we talked a little bit about this before, kind of the

54:39.560 --> 54:45.760
whole play, create, share games that they've got now on the PlayStation 3.

54:45.760 --> 54:50.760
Well, the second one in the series is ModNation Racers, and of course it's kind of like Build

54:50.760 --> 54:56.600
Your Own Mario Kart type game, but they are, just like they did with LittleBigPlanet, they're

54:56.600 --> 55:01.600
going to be having a beta, and it actually starts this month, and there's a few ways

55:01.600 --> 55:03.660
you could be in that beta.

55:03.660 --> 55:06.680
One is of course if you bought- Blowing someone at Sony.

55:06.680 --> 55:07.680
That's one way you can do it.

55:07.680 --> 55:09.360
That might, that might work.

55:09.360 --> 55:12.720
One is if you bought the LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year Edition, which have a code that

55:12.720 --> 55:19.120
came inside the box, and then of course you can also sign up online for a chance to participate

55:19.120 --> 55:26.500
as well, and that of course can be done at us.playstation.com slash ModNation slash online

55:26.500 --> 55:31.240
beta, and you can go ahead and sign up there.

55:31.240 --> 55:37.000
Also you can be an existing subscriber to CORE, or subscribe on or before December 15th,

55:37.000 --> 55:43.840
receive a voucher as well, and you can check out the pretty awesome game, which still no

55:43.840 --> 55:48.580
one has announced that it's going to be on PSP, but it is going to be on PSP.

55:48.580 --> 55:50.360
You heard it here first.

55:50.360 --> 55:53.840
Well, it also doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

55:53.840 --> 55:54.840
Of course.

55:54.840 --> 56:00.080
I mean, to be fair, but it would be nice to have that confirmed by Sony at some point,

56:00.080 --> 56:03.240
but you know, someday they'll decide to say it, and it'll be a big surprise, except not

56:03.240 --> 56:04.240
really.

56:04.240 --> 56:06.040
But I'm actually very much looking forward to ModNation's Racer.

56:06.040 --> 56:10.240
I think this does look like another game that's going to be like a must-have on the PS3, so

56:10.240 --> 56:13.960
I'm very excited to see that.

56:13.960 --> 56:14.960
So we'll see.

56:14.960 --> 56:15.960
Yeah.

56:15.960 --> 56:16.960
I was just reading in chat.

56:16.960 --> 56:17.960
What's that?

56:17.960 --> 56:23.000
Bond 006 said, I think the gay marriage bill was just passed here in New York.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
On a Sunday night?

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Well, I...

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Well, checking the news.

56:26.000 --> 56:33.200
Yeah, I was going to say, careful, there was one that failed a couple days ago in the New

56:33.200 --> 56:37.000
York Senate, I think it was.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
So...

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Let us know as you find out.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Yeah.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
I'd be curious, too.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
You know, it'll be about time.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
I mean, live in the now, people.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Yeah.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
All right.

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
Also, coming to the now, which I'm very excited about, Sunsoft, rise from your grave.

56:54.000 --> 56:58.080
Okay, I mean, that wasn't a Sunsoft game, but still, you might remember Sunsoft.

56:58.080 --> 57:02.160
They made some cool 8-bit games back in the day, one of which, of course, near and dear

57:02.160 --> 57:04.320
to all of our hearts, Fester's Quest.

57:04.320 --> 57:05.640
No, I'm kidding.

57:05.640 --> 57:06.640
Blaster Master.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.120
Well, Fester's Quest wasn't that bad.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.880
But Blaster Master was made by Sunsoft.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.560
Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.480
For me to poop on.

57:13.480 --> 57:18.200
Hey, I got that game for Christmas, one Christmas, and I played it for like a week straight.

57:18.200 --> 57:20.200
It wasn't terrible, except it was very strange.

57:20.200 --> 57:24.560
Like, aliens land in the Addams Family back, forget it.

57:24.560 --> 57:26.280
Blaster Master, fuck everything else.

57:26.280 --> 57:27.720
You have Blaster Master.

57:27.720 --> 57:29.280
Who cares what else Sunsoft did?

57:29.280 --> 57:31.060
They did Blaster Master.

57:31.060 --> 57:35.160
And sure enough, that is the first thing they are planning to release now on the NES Virtual

57:35.160 --> 57:37.600
Console, is Blaster Master.

57:37.600 --> 57:42.000
Unfortunately, it's not like a WiiWare souped-up version or anything like that, but the Wii

57:42.000 --> 57:46.480
Virtual Console release of Blaster Master, 500 Wii points, apparently coming out this

57:46.480 --> 57:47.840
month.

57:47.840 --> 57:51.680
By the way, the whole reason this is happening is because Sunsoft is actually resuming operations

57:51.680 --> 57:52.680
in North America.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.960
They're having a little help from a company called Gaijin Works.

57:55.960 --> 57:59.260
And Gaijin Works made Miami Law for the Nintendo DS.

57:59.260 --> 58:02.240
It was part of Working Designs.

58:02.240 --> 58:05.320
Victor Ireland left them and kind of made this, and so forth.

58:05.320 --> 58:08.760
When Working Designs closed, da-da-da-da-da, one thing led to another.

58:08.760 --> 58:11.600
So now we have Sunsoft.

58:11.600 --> 58:17.280
Quote coming from Ireland, in the, Victor Ireland, that is, in the official announcement.

58:17.280 --> 58:21.120
The first Wii release is a great start, but there is one upcoming announcement in particular

58:21.120 --> 58:26.320
that will demonstrate just how serious Yoshida-san is about rebuilding the Sunsoft console gaming

58:26.320 --> 58:27.520
brand here.

58:27.520 --> 58:29.640
Game fans are going to be pretty happy when they hear about it.

58:29.640 --> 58:31.520
I know I was.

58:31.520 --> 58:33.440
So I'm kind of curious, what other big games did Sunsoft do?

58:33.440 --> 58:36.840
I'm trying to think what their other big franchises were, because I know they had more than that.

58:36.840 --> 58:38.400
Did you say Victor Ireland?

58:38.400 --> 58:39.400
Yes, from Working Designs.

58:39.400 --> 58:40.400
From Working Designs.

58:40.400 --> 58:41.400
Yeah.

58:41.400 --> 58:42.400
We have his Twilight Zone.

58:42.400 --> 58:43.400
Really?

58:43.400 --> 58:44.400
Yes.

58:44.400 --> 58:47.200
Well, he's the guy you can thank for bringing Sunsoft back to life.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.200
Thank you.

58:48.200 --> 58:49.200
And thank you for your pinball table.

58:49.200 --> 58:51.800
Wait, do you have his contact information then?

58:51.800 --> 58:53.520
Dan might.

58:53.520 --> 58:55.200
Could we get him on the show possibly, maybe?

58:55.200 --> 58:56.200
That would be kind of nice.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.200
Let me see if Dan still has it.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.200
Yeah, try to make that happen.

58:58.200 --> 59:01.560
But no, Dan actually bought his Twilight Zone.

59:01.560 --> 59:06.240
And so he gave us, you know that Goemon doll that I have?

59:06.240 --> 59:08.880
He gave us a Goemon doll, because they had a whole bunch of them, because they were supposed

59:08.880 --> 59:12.880
to be for pre-ordering the Goemon game that they never brought out.

59:12.880 --> 59:17.320
Let's see, here's some of the other big things that Sunsoft did.

59:17.320 --> 59:19.240
Arrow the Acrobat.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.280
They did the Blaster Master series, of course.

59:21.280 --> 59:24.640
They did some of the Batman games, like the original Batman on the NES, which was not

59:24.640 --> 59:25.640
too bad.

59:25.640 --> 59:30.040
Let's see, they did Fester's Quest, of course.

59:30.040 --> 59:34.980
Some of the Final Fantasy Legend, I guess, games were translated by them, or localized

59:34.980 --> 59:37.560
or whatever you want to say by them.

59:37.560 --> 59:40.520
Freedom Force, lol.

59:40.520 --> 59:41.600
Lemmings on the NES.

59:41.600 --> 59:44.680
They did a lot of NES ports of games that were big on other systems.

59:44.680 --> 59:48.920
Like Fantasy Zone on the NES was Sunsoft.

59:48.920 --> 59:50.640
You remember how they had like a version of that?

59:50.640 --> 59:52.520
That was done by Sunsoft.

59:52.520 --> 59:55.040
So hmm, very interesting.

59:55.040 --> 59:59.680
Spy Hunter on the NES was them, as well as Super Spy Hunter.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.480
I'd be very curious to see what they have planned.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480
We'll see.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.280
Hope, I would love for some type of like sequel to Blaster Master, because clearly that's

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:12.080
their huge, huge franchise, and something better than the one that was on Genesis, because

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.400
the one that was on Genesis, not so great.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.520
Anyhow, speaking of stuff worthy of the Virtual Console, we're going to take a trip down

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:24.220
memory lane in a segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.640
And every week in the Classic Video Game of the Week segment, Dark Sakura takes a trip

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.480
to the video game vault and pulls out a game that she thinks, dammit, you ought to be playing

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.480
this game.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:39.520
Super Snappers, you need to dust off your NES, or SNES, or as in the case of a lot of

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.520
these games, Sega related systems, and play this game.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.360
So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.360
Final Fight!

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.920
Ah, a topically inspired game, I see.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.920
Yep.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:55.160
I got inspired by last week, although actually it was also when I went and picked up my box

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.160
of Final Fight Guy.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.420
I was like, oh yeah, I should do this.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.420
Because I found the box.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.080
Hold on for a second, play some music.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.080
All right, sure.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:10.160
This is the final boss fight in Final Fight Guy, which really would be the same as regular

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.760
Final Fight 2, but Fighting Belger.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:22.000
Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to get the box, because we're going to take a picture of it.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Wow.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.680
It is, you'll have to put that on the picture site.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.680
I will.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.120
Blockbuster exclusive direct from Japan, Final Fantasy Guy.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.120
Final Fight Guy.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120
I'm sorry, Final Fight Guy.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.440
That was, I got that when I had- Who's going to say Fatal Fury Guy?

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440
I've done that before, too.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.320
I had my, uh, this one I had my whole little obsession with getting everything Final Fight

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.560
until they put out a Final Fight that sucks, but I've got Final Fight CD and Mighty Final

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.640
Fight, which was the SD version that came out on Nintendo, but yeah, let me get, actually

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.640
get back to the game.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.200
Um, Final Fight was an arcade game put out by Capcom, and it was designed by Nishitani

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.760
Akira, who you will see as Nin Nin, and characters were designed by Yasuda Akira, which you'll

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:05.480
see as Akiman, so some of those things should definitely be familiar, all this Capcom-tastic

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.480
music.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:13.320
So yeah, you gotta go rescue, uh, uh, the mayor's daughter, who happens to be, uh, Cody's,

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:19.480
uh, chick, and the mayor is also a former wrestler named Mike Hagar, who showed up in,

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.720
what, Saturday Night Slam Masters, right?

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.320
Yes, Saturday Night Slam Masters, which is also amazing.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:31.420
So when this game, though, came out on the, um, the sneeze, or the SNES, sorry, um, you

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:35.960
only could play as Cody or Hagar, so they brought out Final Fight Guy, so we could play

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960
Guy.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:43.760
Um, he's, though, super fast and was, like, super awesome to play with, so never mind.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.240
Um, Cody was the balanced guy, Hagar was the strong guy.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.960
He's also ranked third in EGM's list of Top 10 Video Game Politicians.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:03:00.920
So there were, um, so this game is actually way ahead of, uh, of its time, because it

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.080
actually had pre-op transgender women in it.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.080
Whatever.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:12.420
Anyway, yeah, there are actually two, um, women in the game called Poison and Roxy,

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:19.040
but they, um, turned them into men named Billy and Sid, for the American version.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.260
So there were.

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.080
So that you're not hitting women.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.080
I guess.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.760
Or hoochie women with really short skirts, and, you know, where you can see underboobs.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760
I see.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760
Um, there was a- Underboobs.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:36.200
You know what I mean, when the shirts- I know, I know what you're talking about, it's just,

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.040
I haven't heard it phrased quite so eloquently before.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:43.480
There was also the Andore family that were all based off of Andre the Giant.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480
Yeah.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:51.280
Um, also, um, a character named 2P that was based, um, off of, uh, Player 2 character

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.280
from Forgotten Worlds.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.280
Did you ever play that game, Rob?

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.280
Mmm, don't think so.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.280
It had, like, the special controller.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.400
It was one of Capcom's kind of interesting weird games, but, um, since he looked like

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.480
the second player, he was called 2P.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.480
So anyway.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.840
Um, and then you had your bosses.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.360
You had Damned, who in the US was Thrasher.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:16.840
Um, you had, uh, Sodom, who was, um, called Katana in the US version.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.960
But, um, he came out, and he was one of the ones that was brought back for Street Fighter

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.960
Alpha series.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.840
Um, in fact, that's the other video that I linked you up, was the fight with him.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.640
Let me play that one real quick.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.240
There's also, uh, Eddie E, and Rolento, who's another one who came in for Street Fighter

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.560
Alpha.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:40.920
And then Abigail, who's actually a dude, but if I was named Abigail, I'd probably be frustrated

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.380
and I'm a chick.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.960
And then Belger, the final guy, who's actually kind of interesting.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:51.180
You actually start fighting him while he's holding the girl in his lap, and she ducks

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:56.760
and screams, and finally he just, you know, she falls over with her butt in the air.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.760
Seriously.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.460
Like, that's not wrong.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.460
So what is this guy?

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.460
You're fighting a guy named Sodom?

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.460
Yeah.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:05.840
You have a twin brother named Gamora?

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.840
What is this?

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.200
I, well, you know, that's part of why they changed his name.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.280
They called him Katana when they came out in the US, but I mean, he's called Sodom in

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.200
Street Fighter Alpha series.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:22.920
He's like some guy who, like, some huge, he's like the uber crazy violent otaku guy who's

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:27.200
like so obsessed with Japanese culture that he, like, wears a samurai hat and football

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.200
armor.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200
Or football padding.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.200
That's stupid.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200
But yeah.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:42.640
But they said that the basis for Final Fight is actually off Double Dragon 2, the revenge

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:49.600
in the arcade, so they brought it up and they actually were saying that some of the characters

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.440
were former Street Fighters.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.440
So it's kind of neat.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:56.780
So yeah, there was the whole issue with the ports, and I'm actually going to take a link

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:04.960
off of the, well, you can actually see pictures up, and I'm going to link them in the chat

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:14.200
room, of the changes to the characters, to the poison character.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:21.400
And then, but now for other versions, there's Sega CD, the Sega CD version, which I have,

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.580
I love Final Fight CD.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.540
It's got a range soundtrack and a time attack mode.

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.200
It's super fun.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.680
I've got Final Fight 1 somewhere for GBA.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:39.680
There was, when it came out in the US, actually there was an Amiga Atari ST, Commodore 64,

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:46.200
ZX Spectrum, well that was in Europe, and Amstrad CPC version.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:50.480
There was a Sharp X68000 version that came out.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:54.880
There was the one I mentioned, Mighty Final Fight, which was the 8-bit version for NES

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.360
that had the super deformed, and it's actually super fun.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.920
It is really fun and really cute.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.920
Cheap and Final Fight.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.920
Yeah.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:07.760
Final, well, no, it's super deformed because they are like the really squished up book

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.760
embodies.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.040
Yeah, I've seen it.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.760
Also Final Fight came out on the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 for PlayStation 2 and

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:21.240
Xbox and a portable version, Capcom Classics Collection Remix for PSP.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:26.440
And it had the emulated CPS music, so that was pretty cool.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:33.600
There was also Final Fight Streetwise, which I pretend not to exist because it sucks.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:38.800
Or maybe it was the Final Fight Double Imp.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800
Nope.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.840
It was the new one that they tried to do.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.840
Yeah.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.840
Whatever.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.840
Damn, I only knew the Final Fight that was at the local pizza place.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.840
Oh, there's also sequels.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.840
There was Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.840
I've got those.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.840
They were actually fun.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:08:02.440
Now, there's also an American Street Fighter animated series, and I know it sucks, but

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.600
they actually had Cody and Guy teaming up with Ken and Ryu.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.000
It was really weird.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.960
There are also, of course, my KGARs in Saturday Night Slam Masters and Muscle Bomber Duo in

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.480
Slam Masters 2 The Ring of Destruction.

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:22.120
Street Fighter games, you had Guy and Sodom, then Rolento and Cody in Street Fighter Alpha

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.120
3.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.840
And then you had in Street Fighter 3 Second Impact, you had the character that was modeled

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.920
after Andori, and his manager is Poison.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.840
I don't know if you ever played Street Fighter 3.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.320
Just a couple times.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.040
That was kind of during that phase where I was out of touch with gaming for a little

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040
bit.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.160
And Guy and Guy are actually going to be in Super Street Fighter 4.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.360
Yeah, and I remember that was the story last week that kind of probably got you thinking

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.360
about this.

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360
I think that's pretty cool.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:52.720
Yeah, there was also another 3D fighting game version, Final Fight Revenge.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:56.640
And then, you know, meh.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.720
But also, now it sort of seems that they used the same format, though, for a lot of the

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.400
other games that came out afterwards, like King of Dragons and Knights of the Round.

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:10.040
Captain Commando, Warriors of Fate, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The Punisher, D&D Tower of

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:14.800
Doom, and then Alien vs. Predator, though, I think is one of the best games to come after

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.800
that.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.560
But yeah, a lot of that came through.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.560
So yeah, Final Fight.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.560
Win.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.560
Alright.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.960
There it is, your classic game of the week, Final Fight, available on lots and lots of

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960
systems.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.960
I'll post those pictures.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.960
The arcade was one of the most memorable.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.920
Alright, that's going to do it for part A here of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:39.240
anywhere because we've got plenty more to come in part B, including your Twitter topics,

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.680
which I haven't put a call out for on Twitter yet, but we'll get those.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.280
And I haven't seen any emails this week.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.760
I don't even know if we'll have any of those, but we'll get to those.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.800
But we do have some news, if nothing else, talking about Red Box expanding to Game Rental,

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.280
which I think has come up on the show before, but now it's going to the next step.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.080
Somebody beat World of Warcraft.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.080
Yes, somebody beat it.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.640
More things to waste money on your Xbox Live avatars with, and of course, it wouldn't be

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.840
Lolsy if we didn't talk about an adult game, so we'll be talking about that all in the

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.840
next segment.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.840
So stay tuned.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:16.480
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.560
Hello everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening,

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:26.280
December the 6th of 2009, where we're eagerly anticipating snow tomorrow here in Sacramento,

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.840
where Orange Lounge Radio is based, when we never, and this is a big deal, I realize some

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.200
of you live in the East Coast and even in other countries where snow is probably no

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:34.200
big deal.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.280
In fact, you probably hate it.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.600
But we never see snow here, so even the fact that it's just going to even sprinkle a little

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.480
white tomorrow is going to be amazing.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.480
I'm excited.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.160
Too bad it's not Christmas tomorrow.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.440
That would make it even better, but oh well.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.040
So we're all excited about that.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:52.760
Anyhow, we've got plenty more news to get into tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:57.120
Of course, we always tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio at 6 o'clock Pacific,

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.160
9 o'clock Eastern Time, right at the close of the Bobby Black Wolf Show, which is on

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.840
one hour before we start at 5 or 8, depending on where you live.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.960
We're going to get into some rapid fire news, and then we'll get into your Twitter topics

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.160
in just a little bit.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.160
Send them on Twitter if you have anything you want to send us.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.160
Yes.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.400
So one of the games that's coming out this week, The Saboteur, is getting some day one

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.160
DLC.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:27.880
And this is to entice you to buy the game new, because if you don't buy it new, then

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.080
you'll have to purchase this separately.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.520
But what you get with the game is a code to download The Midnight Show.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:40.040
And what The Midnight Show is, well, it's the nudity that's in The Saboteur.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:47.720
Lots of naked chicks that do little dances for you, and contains new hiding spots, a

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.080
new minigame, and of course, it's an option to unlock the nudity, so if you really don't

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.540
want to see naked women, then you don't have to.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.840
And once again, if you do pick up the game used, you will be able to get the download

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.840
content.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:07.720
It's going to cost you $3 or 240 Microsoft points.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.720
Let's see.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.000
Dante's Inferno, the God of War-esque type game, will be coming to the PlayStation Network

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.400
and Xbox Live Marketplace in the form of a demo soon.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.920
The PlayStation Network will get it a few weeks early, in fact, you'll be able to pick

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.080
it up next week on Thursday, December 10th.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.600
The Xbox Live Marketplace will be getting it on December 24th.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:35.920
And the game itself is not scheduled to come out until, I believe, February, so got a ways

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.920
there.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.640
And then finally, Santa Claus is coming to PlayStation Home.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:49.360
And you will be able to interact with Santa Claus and the elves and whatnot, and they

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.440
also have different minigames as well.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:59.120
And of course, there's also a photo elf that you can take pictures with or get some decorated

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.400
pictures for your home.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.600
When I ask for a BB gun, will he tell me you'll shoot your eye out?

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.600
Perhaps.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.840
You know what's funny is my character is still dressed like Santa from last year.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.480
Nice.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.840
And that's how it's gonna stay.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.840
Now you need to change it.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.600
You need to change it to like a Halloween outfit or something now that it's Christmas.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.600
Nope.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.600
Still gonna be Santa.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.600
You'll be like Jack Skellington.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.880
Cause my guy is like a hobo.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.560
Cause you actually paid money for the Santa costume, right?

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.560
Hobo Santa?

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.200
Yeah, well that's the only costume I'm wearing.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:35.720
Did you ever log into home, like during June or anything?

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.960
We still have that club in home.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.600
I haven't checked in like a week to see if there's any new people, so sorry if I haven't

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600
gone to.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.760
But yeah, we still have that little clubhouse in home.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.480
Don't know what to do with it.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:48.360
It's been suggested maybe we should have a OLR home meetup.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.360
So maybe someday.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.360
We'll see.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:53.460
Anyhow, going into some other rapid fire news.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.460
Big sale at Walmart.

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:59.900
If you still do not have a Wii, now might be the time to do that because for one week

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:04.840
from December 5th to 12th, every Wii will come with a $50 gift card.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:12.840
So you take $199 for the Wii, eliminate $50, that's basically give or take $150 for a Wii.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.760
Which you could use the $50 gift card to buy games or whatever else you need at Walmart.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.840
Also there's some big price dips in games.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.220
I wouldn't be surprised if those Wiis were already sold out, sadly, by the time you hear

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.600
this show.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.600
But you never know.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.000
Check your Walmart because that deal is supposed to be good for all this week.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.700
They might get more shipments during the week.

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:30.880
You never know what might happen.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.600
But keep an eye out for those cheap deals.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.200
It's not just Black Friday.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:39.480
Well I didn't think this game could be possibly ported anywhere else, but I was proven wrong.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.020
Dragon's Lair is coming out for the iPhone.

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:46.720
That's right, the old school 1983 laser disc game Dragon's Lair that's been released on

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:54.240
every single console ever, it seems like anyway, is now coming to the iPhone thanks to Electronic

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.300
Arts who is doing the port.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.720
Not sure exactly how they're doing it.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.200
It looks like you have little up, down, left, right arrows on the screen.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.280
Right, except the corners of the screen.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.000
Basically a big button on the other side for the sword button there.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.120
It is coming out for five bucks, I think?

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.000
Because that's what Space Ace is priced at.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.600
So they don't have a final price yet, but Space Ace is five bucks.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.720
They also had Cobra Command as well, which is very similar.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.720
I might need to get Dragon's Lair, except you know what I just found while I was cleaning

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.720
off my desk?

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.720
Dragon's Lair?

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.920
Dragon's Lair HD.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.880
Oh, the HD kind of different one they did a while ago.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:32.880
Yeah, I remember that.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.760
Hidden under a layer of stuff.

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:35.760
Wow.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.520
I tell you, I sneeze and find games, Rob.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.000
I still need to take a picture of Final Fight Guy, don't I?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Yes you do.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.320
Yeah, so I don't know.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.960
I will always be partial to the Dragon's Lair that was on the Commodore 64.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.120
It was way different.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.640
It was like a completely different game.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.980
Harder than hell, but a lot of fun, I have to admit.

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.520
That's the one I'll always be partial to.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.880
Anyhow, how about some news about Rock Band?

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:03.040
Of course, it wouldn't be a week here at OLR if we didn't have news about upcoming Rock

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.280
Band releases.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.720
More Green Day coming out for Rock Band.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.840
Apparently Christian's Inferno, Last of the American Girls, and Viva La Gloria, which

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.600
I believe are all off the latest CD, 21st Century Breakdown, are on their way on December

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:21.680
15th or December 17th, depending on what system you're on.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.360
But also to look forward to in Rock Band, some songs coming out within the next couple

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.360
of weeks.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:29.400
This week, actually, December 8th or December 10th.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.800
Slipknot songs, Duality, Psychosocial, and Sulphur.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.600
And then some individual tracks, a track by Lights Resolve called Dreaming of Love, which

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.160
is free, by the way, so you can check that out for free.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.080
And this is kind of awesome in a real dorky sort of way, Simon and Garfunkel are getting

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.880
some songs in Rock Band.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.860
I Am A Rock and The Sounds of Silence, because when you want to rock, I know the first thing

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.120
you think of is Simon and Garfunkel.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.960
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us tonight?

01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.700
Just a few things, actually, and it isn't actually the page I was looking at about the

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:12.360
land of make-believe, Gearbox actually trademarked border worlds, so the rumor is that Borderlands

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:19.480
could be extended into an actual universe of games, and Borderlands is pretty fun from

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.720
what I've seen, so I could see, and you know, everyone I've actually talked to that's played

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.080
it says that it's a fantastic game.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:31.080
So I can actually see the expansion happening, you know, I think it'd be a good thing.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.400
Lots of, you know, shooting midgets.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.760
And then the UK has a date for Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker, it will be the 28th of

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:51.520
May, and of course that's going to be on, sorry, PSP, and actually in Japan it's going

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.420
to be coming out on March 18th.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:59.900
So four-player co-op, it can be Snake, Snake-oo!

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:08.120
And then Squeenix put out a song, a game, a song summoner for iPhone, it's actually

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:16.080
called Song Summoner The Unsung Heroes for iPhone and iPod Touch, and that it's got touchscreen

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:23.120
controls of course, and characters in different scenarios, and it's supposed to be out, there's

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:30.000
a demo for it out actually, and for UK customers it'll be £5.99, so.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.760
I've heard that Song Summoner is kind of anth though, because it was out on the old-school

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:40.480
iPod, you know, well, in other words the iPods a lot of people still have really, they came

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.040
out on those a while ago, and I think it was kind of under the radar because the iPhones

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.960
and iTouches had already come out and a lot of those releases got missed, but.

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.280
I'd like to see what they've actually managed to do with it.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:53.640
Yeah, you never know, they might have like kind of changed some things and done some

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:57.800
upgrades too, so it would be kind of cool to see what is going on.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:01.280
What I'd like to see what's going on with right now is the Twitter topic, so let's open

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:05.680
up ye old Twitter, and see what you guys have to say, a very fast night with the Twitter

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.360
topics by the way, I'm quite impressed.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.040
SEG starting us off tonight, of course with another plug for OOMLOUD, because that's happening

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:15.520
this week, SEG wants to know, are y'all going to OOMLOUD?

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.240
I'm going for sure, but I think the fact that it's on a weeknight is kind of screwing with

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.640
everyone else because it is a couple hours away.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.520
Everyone has to usually work at six in the morning.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.640
Yeah, I'm able to kind of swing it where I'm getting off work a little early so I can make

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.080
it, but it might, I might be the sole representation there.

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:34.640
Sorry, but I'm going to have three times the fun, so meh.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.560
Hope to see some of you listeners there that are local to San Francisco.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.960
Alex Carson says, I'm going to make a PSP app for your show if that's okay with you

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:42.960
guys.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:50.400
Actually, we do have a PSP website, olrpsp.com, and you can download a PSP radio tuner there,

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.800
I forgot about that in the earlier part of the show, because Loki hasn't updated it in

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.160
a couple years, so whereas you might have some broken graphics and things, I think it

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.160
still works, right?

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.920
Loki, I don't know, have you checked that out in a while?

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.440
I think it still sort of works.

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.440
Yeah.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.440
So you might want to check that out.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.120
If you can make it better, hey, we are not going to complain.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.440
I got to tell you, we would be very excited about that.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.000
Spazinator going off on us a little bit, no offense, but Californians don't know squat

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
about snow.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Try sending many winters in Buffalo, then you'll know about snow.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
No, I agree.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.520
The one-eighth of an inch of snow you're getting pales in comparison to what we usually get,

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.400
six inches to as much as two feet.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.600
I do want to say, though, careful, because when you say Californians, you're talking

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:33.880
about the entire state of California, we do have actually a lot of snowy places in California.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:39.000
I don't live in one, but we have Lake Tahoe, for example, they get a lot of snow up there,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.680
so careful, California is not all beaches and surfers.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:45.680
Let's see.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:52.560
Dark Tetsuya says, Arcade Heroes is picking the best arcade game of the past decade, 2000

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.240
to 2009.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.240
Thoughts?

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:59.720
My thought is, I'm kind of sad because this was the decade that arcades kind of died and

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.680
got replaced with ticket redemption machines, so I don't know if I have an easy answer.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:11.200
Anyone have an answer for what the best arcade game of the past 10 years would be?

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.200
Strider 2.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.240
I mean, obviously, DDR was somewhat impactful for us.

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.240
Strider 2?

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:26.200
I would say also maybe like, what was it, oh gosh, oh, I know, Final Furlong, horsey

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.200
riding game.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.200
Final Furlong.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.200
Horsey Humping!

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.200
Yes, and Derby Owner's Club.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.200
Derby was pretty good.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.240
I would say Derby Owner's Club just because it's so fucking epic, like when you see it.

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:41.080
I mean, it's like, it's the size of an arcade, amazing.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.200
So there you go, those would be some of my picks.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.600
And if none of those work, then eh, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is pretty fucking sweet, I gotta

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.600
say.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:54.160
Let's see, other topics here.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:59.440
Fernando says on the Twitter, Sky, I love you, let's repeal Prop 8 and get married.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:04.880
Hey, I'm all about repealing Prop 8, which is some major bullshit, but I think you might

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.900
need to take me to dinner first before I agree to get married, just saying.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:13.560
Alex Carson wants to know, how many of you are phone freakers?

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.560
What is that?

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.200
I don't even, like it's like hacking your phone, right?

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.200
Yeah, I'm not.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.800
Is that like, back in the day, like people used to modify like those Captain Crunch whistles

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:26.040
to be able to like, dial the phones, when back in the day it was the rotary pulse dials?

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.320
Like is that the kind of stuff we're talking about?

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.160
Like old school hacking stuff?

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:35.680
I find that stuff interesting, but I don't do it myself.

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.640
Plus it's all like cell phones now.

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:44.400
I've decided what I'm going to do when I get my new iPhone, is take my old one and pimp

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:48.320
it out to look all steampunk, which I'm probably going to do with my new one, because even

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.360
though yes, it's a great design, a lot of work went into the design of it, I bought

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:57.160
it, I want to change it up a bit, so I'm going to, but I've decided that I'm going to release

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:03.960
it as the limited edition Dark Sakura old school iPhone, and sell it for 700 bucks.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:09.960
Let's see, Javier Altman on Twitter says, OLR, pick your topic, the platypus is made

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:15.400
out of other animal spare parts, or the Saboteur Boobies DLC with love footy.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:20.500
Well, we already talked about the Saboteur Boobies DLC, so the platypus is made out of

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.800
other animal spare parts.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.360
Isn't that like a hot dog, actually, you're talking about?

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.840
I think that the platypus is God going, see?

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.200
Blue Swim says, what do you think of the Best Buy giving DSI buyers a free copy of Tony

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:40.320
Hawk's Motion, a game which requires a GBA port to play?

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.200
This is where if I had the Price is Right losing horn queued up, I'd play it right now.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:46.480
That's kind of humorous, actually, in a sick way.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480
That's hilarious.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:48.480
That's a Best Buy movie.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.680
I didn't hear about that at all, actually, so thank you for bringing that to my attention,

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.880
because it's pretty lolsy.

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:59.920
Master of the Claw sent us a YouTube link to some people having fun jamming.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:03.320
Look at that, they're getting down.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.200
Oh my God, they're dancing to Bird is the Word.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.320
It reminds me of that Family Guy episode.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:10.400
They're playing a game called Just Dance on the Wii.

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.400
Bird is the Word.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.160
Bird, bird, bird.

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.520
Did you hear?

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.160
Bird is the Word.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:22.120
The fact that it's in that game, that makes the game 100% good.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.360
Yeah, I heard of this game and it looked ridiculous, but now that I know that it's tongue-in-cheek

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:32.400
ridiculous, I'm far more interested, so thank you for bringing it to my attention.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.640
That guy is just getting down in that chick.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.800
I don't think that chick would be getting down like this, though, if you weren't paying

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.800
her to do it.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.960
She looks a little bit emo.

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.140
That's awesome.

01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:46.760
That game does kind of look like fun, actually.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.160
Thank you, Just Dance on the Wii.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.880
I am assuming that's out now?

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:50.880
I don't know.

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:51.880
Yes, that's out now.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:52.880
I don't know, Loki.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.880
Been out for a few weeks.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.680
Loki, we might have to play that and YouTube it.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.680
No, we don't.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.280
No, we don't.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.720
But Loki, didn't you hear?

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.000
Bird is the Word.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.220
Yes, and granted, I love that song, but I'm not going to play that game.

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:08.800
They want a link in chat here.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:09.800
Here you go, chatters.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:10.800
There's the link.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:17.920
It's a bit L-Y link I got from Master of the Claw on Twitter, so you win Twitter tonight,

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.560
Master of the Claw for getting the bird as the word, and that dancing.

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.560
Did you notice?

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.080
They were actually walking around, clucking like chickens.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.920
Granted, they were Ubisoft employees, but they tend to go over, yeah.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.600
That could be the game of the year right there, if we didn't have President Cat this year.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.840
Speaking of President Cat, I got to get this out here real quick.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.560
Did you know there's still no word about President Cat getting a release over here in the US?

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:42.560
Just so you know.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:48.200
There's still no word on that, but do you know what game is coming out on WiiWare in

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.520
a couple months?

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.520
Is that Muscle March?

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.040
Muscle March is coming out.

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.880
Do you know what Muscle March is?

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:59.440
If you don't know what Muscle March is, you need to YouTube this game immediately, because

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:08.060
it's like, it's awesome, but it's like, imagine Cho Aniki meets that game, meets that game

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:13.080
show where you have to twist your body to not fall through the wall or whatever, meets

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:19.780
crack, pure adulterated crack.

01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:23.360
I can't believe that game is coming out and yet no word on President Cat, I'm just saying.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:30.400
And all this bullshit about President Cat only sold a hundred copies, source please!

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.160
I mean, I know probably like a hundred people over here that imported it.

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.120
Apparently it got a shout out on the 1UP show this week.

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.120
I don't listen to that show.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.880
Yeah, they discovered the game, and so therefore they're informing the internet of the game

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.040
and they should come over here, and they're the first ones that ever discovered the game.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.040
Clearly, yes, they just-

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.880
Um, how about they're full of shit?

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.440
Everybody, send letters!

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.240
Well, to be fair, they didn't call it President Cat.

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:54.000
If they had called it President Cat, I would say something.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
But we referred to it by name.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Yeah, I know.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I'm just...

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
It doesn't matter.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.640
It matters to me!

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.280
How dare they steal our thunder!

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.400
I don't, I don't care.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.400
I care!

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.640
I'm all about spreading the word about the game, and if it gets it out there, then whatever.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.160
We, it's time, no, no, that's why we don't get recognized, Rob.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.160
We need to pimp ourselves.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.160
You can't prove it.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.160
You can't prove it.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.160
I've got the internet.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.160
I have the days to post.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.160
Alright.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.160
I've got to go on a joystick, and, you know.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:24.080
You've got Joystick and Destructoid backing us up, so nah.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.320
I just don't care enough.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.320
I'm sorry.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.960
I don't care enough.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.760
I don't want to become the President Cat show, okay?

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:31.760
And to be fair-

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.760
It had its moment.

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.760
I'm over it.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.520
I listened to a little bit of, you know, that, the podcast, and they're like, yeah, we heard

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.160
it sold, like, 80 copies, so, because there's 81, yo-ho!

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.760
Ah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:50.000
They're firing on all cylinders over there.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.640
Let's see, um, where was I?

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:59.880
Matt Ostrowski tweeted us, by the way, one more tweet here that the OLR listeners will

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:00.880
want to know.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.720
OLR Evolution's second mix will be coming out December 24th for everyone.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.100
Oh, that's cool, like a little Christmas present, or Hanukkah present, if you will, whatever

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:11.600
it is you're into, or Kwanzaa, I don't care.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.880
Whatever you celebrate, Solstice, or, you know, what do Pastafarians celebrate on Christmas,

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.880
I guess?

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.320
They, uh, celebrate, uh, Nokimas.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.760
I guess that's what it is, a pirate day.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.120
Um, anyhow, whatever it is you celebrate this winter, OLR Evolution's second mix is coming

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.440
out, and if you don't know what that is, it's like a DDR clone type thing, or, they take

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.080
one of those DDR sims, and they completely reskin it with OLR-related songs, and I think

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:39.200
they even, like, take clips of our voice, and now we're, like, the announcers in the

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.200
game.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.160
So, it's a lot of great fan work.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.160
It's, you know what-

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.680
I mean, I definitely need to check this out.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.640
I take it as a big compliment.

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.640
It's amazing.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.400
So thank you very much, fans, for putting that together.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.400
You guys rock.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.360
That Just Dance game looks interesting.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.640
Doesn't Just Dance kind of look like fun?

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.080
It's just, it's only because that song's in there, if it's any other song, I wouldn't

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.080
give it to it.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.620
I will admit, to the tweeter who asked why the hell we hadn't talked about it before,

01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:04.200
when I saw the box art in, like, the songs they were advertising, I was like, eh, this

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.800
is, like, gonna be Weech here, or something.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:10.840
I just, I did dismiss it very quickly, but it looks like it could be ridiculous fun.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:11.840
Who knows?

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.040
If it was called Just Dance featuring the bird, Surfing Bird, you know, a hundred thousand

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.120
more copies sold right there.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:24.760
All right, let's move on to some more gaming news and Loki.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:35.780
Yes, um, so Red Box, the DVD kiosk rental place that's been popularized by all its locations

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:43.200
and Walmarts and various supermarkets and everywhere else in between, they are now test

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:51.160
marketing, well, they have been test marketing game rentals in Reno, Nevada and Wilmington,

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:55.640
North Carolina, and they're testing them out at two dollars a piece.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.640
Yeah, I've been well aware of this.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:02.920
Something we deal with, actually, so.

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:06.600
And hopefully it's something that will launch full scale at some point.

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:11.840
They're also testing some higher price points, too, for DVD rentals, but that's another story.

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:15.260
That's a whole thing, because I hear the movie studios are pissed that they're only charging

01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:21.800
a dollar for DVD rentals, because it devalues the movie, as in, as if ending up in the five

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.760
dollar bin at Walmart isn't devaluing your movie.

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.760
I mean, please get over yourself.

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:30.560
I could talk for a long time about how retarded that whole comment of them saying that it

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.560
devalues movies and stuff, because they're worried that people are going to go to these

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.720
movies and say, well, I don't have to buy your movies, you know, sell through, I'm just

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:41.000
going to go rent it from this kiosk for a dollar.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.880
And they figure, oh, if we take that away, then they'll go buy the DVD.

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:48.080
No, they'll actually just go rent it from someplace else for less.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:52.400
You know, they're not going to just go, oh, well, I guess I have to go buy the DVD now

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:53.960
to watch it.

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.360
Or they're going to go, oh, well, I'm just going to...

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:59.240
What about Netflix, where I get it for free, pretty much, with a subscription?

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.000
I mean, it's retarded.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.400
There are some that have jumped on board.

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.960
There's some, though, that they realize that they've made a mistake, but they're stubborn,

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.880
so they're going to stick to their guns, and that's unfortunately the case.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:13.440
This actually, I believe, is unrelated to all that.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:18.560
The reason why I think they're raising their rentals to two dollars is because they're

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:23.800
starting to carry more Blu-rays in there, and you can't rent a Blu-ray for a buck a

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.560
day and expect to make a return on your investment.

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:30.480
Yeah, that's true, too, is that they're going to lose money at that rate.

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:33.360
But still, I think it's kind of cool, though, two dollar rentals for games, I mean, that's

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.360
not bad.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.360
That's not bad at all.

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:39.000
No, I mean, I don't rent games, really, anymore, but if I did...

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.920
I don't either, but I should.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.140
I would save a lot of money if I were smart enough to rent the games.

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:47.400
My only issue is that the nearest red box machine I can think of is at Wal-Mart, and

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.700
I ain't setting foot in that place.

01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.760
But it's just like a few feet into Wal-Mart, I mean, it's like...

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:55.840
I have to get through the parking lot and all the people asking me for money.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.560
Seriously, the Wal-Mart by where I live is sick.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.560
You know why they also Safeway?

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.560
Check it out.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:01.560
They need to nuke it.

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.120
I found a secret entrance into the Wal-Mart near where I live.

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:06.920
There's actually a side one by where they push the carts in that no one uses.

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:07.920
Really?

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.320
So I actually bypass the front door completely.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.360
They don't have one like that here.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.360
Just go to Safeway.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.360
I'll go to Safeway.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.360
Safeway's nice.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360
Yeah.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.740
Which is funny, Safeway is next door to Wal-Mart, yet Safeway doesn't have that problem, because

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:22.240
Safeway hires security guards.

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:27.160
Safeway probably also doesn't want people loitering out front selling shit too, so...

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:31.360
I had people knock at my door today, two different people trying to sell me shit.

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.040
I hate that shit.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.560
You know, someone trying to sell me the Sac B so they can get their thousand dollar scholarship.

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.560
I don't give a shit!

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.360
Do you know how many of those kids have come to my door in like the past couple weeks?

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:43.840
Because when I was home sick with the swine flu, I swear to God, like three of those people

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.840
came by the house.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:48.600
I'm like, I'm gonna cough on you, and then you're really gonna have something to fundraise

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.600
for.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.600
And then like, do you have any cans?

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.600
No!

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.600
I don't have any cans!

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.000
Go away!

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.400
People dig through the recycle bin at my house.

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:02.520
It's kinda, like, I gotta watch what I throw in there.

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.520
It's kinda freaky.

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.520
People suck.

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:09.360
Anyhow, Toa Gak in our chat says, threaten to shoot them if they don't get off your property.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.520
Sadly, it's not that easy.

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:16.860
DarkTattooia is pointing me to the PeopleOfWalmart.com website, which, by the way, love.

01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:17.860
Love that site.

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.860
Hilarity.

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:19.860
Great time waster.

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:20.860
Yes, great time waster.

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:23.000
The other person wants to know, is Walmart that bad in California?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.440
Depends where you are.

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.560
There's some really nice ones.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:27.680
There's some really nice Walmarts I will go to.

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.600
I like the, well, Walmart for me also, when I first moved out here, I could not find a

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.600
Walmart.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.360
We had to go to, like, Elberta to find a Walmart.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.560
Yeah, they're only new as of the past, you know, ten years, as long as you've been here.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.120
Well, now we have the supercenters now.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.120
Yeah, and honestly, that makes the difference to me.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.800
If it's a supercenter, it's usually really nice.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:43.800
If it's not, they'll go there.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.040
Well, for the longest time, we couldn't have them out here because of actually zoning laws

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.640
regarding grocery stores, where you could have a certain number of grocery stores within

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.880
a certain radius of each other.

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:56.760
But I think they since lived through that, because I saw them building the one on Antelope

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:01.800
way back, well, here near where I live, when I would come home from work, and now it's

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:02.800
here, and I love it.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.760
And whenever, actually, it's kind of funny, I just stayed in there for two hours when

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:10.200
they first opened it, because I was so homesick.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.680
When I get homesick, I go to Walmart.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:17.000
Honestly though, why would I ever go to Walmart when there's a Target just a couple blocks

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.320
away that's brand spanking new, and nice, and even has groceries now?

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.280
It's Uber Target, and I love it.

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:28.440
Actually, Walmart does have better prices for certain things, like, okay, I know you're

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.320
not a chick, but...

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.320
Tampons?

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.320
No, actually, the hair dye that I buy actually get cheaper.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:40.240
A lot of the stuff that I get actually, I tend to get a whole lot cheaper than action

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:44.360
figures.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:49.880
Where else can I go to get, you know, a bag of baby spinach, and then run it over and

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:55.560
buy some Equate brand NyQuil stuff?

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.280
Hitstun is mentioning Costco.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.000
Actually, it was Marissa that first said it.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.440
Screw Sam's Club, Costco for the win.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:06.360
Costco's pretty awesome if you need, like, 15 of something.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:10.600
Because seriously, like, I think a great arrangement would be to have, like, a really good friend

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.600
that you can go, like, shopping at Costco with for your necessities, and then split

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.400
what you buy in half.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:16.400
You know what?

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.400
It would be a smart arrangement.

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.400
You know what?

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.400
We do.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.400
Well, we actually did just get a Costco membership, but we had a friend.

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.760
Actually, our landlord, but he's a buddy of ours, has a Costco membership, and then Dan

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.640
is our friend Julie's complimentary spouse.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.640
Nice.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.720
I actually got pissed off over that the first time, though.

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.440
But I think we have our own membership now, but still.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:39.560
I like Costco quite a bit, actually.

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.360
All joking aside about the bulk items, they do have really good deals on, like, TVs and,

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.520
you know, the high-end stuff.

01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:46.200
Like, I got my TV at Costco.

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:49.080
Well, I told you about what happened with ours, right?

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:55.040
Well, keep in mind, with Costco, you can return anything anytime without your receipt.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.040
You can just go.

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:57.600
It'll be on your membership card.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:58.600
Yeah.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:04.180
So we took, we had our old 50-inch widescreen TV, and we actually took it back to exchange

01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:07.880
it for, you know, something that was equivalent.

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:11.440
And we actually now have a 52-inch LCD widescreen.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.960
So because we could exchange it for anything equivalent, and it was the only equivalent

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.780
they had, our old model is not made anymore.

01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:21.840
They do have a great return policy at Target, or not Target, at Costco.

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:24.520
I did have a TV break, and I took it back, and they took it back.

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:25.520
Amazing.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.840
Anyhow, I don't know how we got from Redbox to Costco, but we did.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.840
So there you go.

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:33.960
World of Warcraft, moving on to this crack of a game, World of Warcraft, World of War

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:34.960
crack.

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:35.960
I'm addicted.

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:36.960
What can I say?

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:37.960
It's fun.

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:38.960
But did you hear that it got beaten?

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.760
Yes, somebody beat the World of Warcraft.

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.520
And of course, they live in Taiwan, and the character's name is Little Gray, if you translate

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:47.520
the name.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.320
They've beat the World of Warcraft.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.480
What do I mean by beat?

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:53.720
No, I don't mean they beat the final raid in the game, because then a lot of people

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.080
have beat it, if that's the case.

01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:02.680
No, they have gotten every single achievement in World of Warcraft, all 986.

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.680
Someone has no fucking life.

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.680
Here's my thought.

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.320
I bet multiple people are splitting this account.

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.160
I bet multiple people contributed to this.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.000
It probably wasn't just one person.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.600
It's still an impressive achievement, though, but at the same time, time to go outside,

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.280
because there's some achievements in there that are crazy.

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:22.720
One of them is that you have to get exalted with Aldor, and then you have to go all the

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:27.360
way down to Hated and get exalted with Scryer.

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.240
That means nothing to people that don't play WoW.

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.680
It means nothing to me.

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.680
It takes a lot.

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:32.680
It's a lot of fucking grinding.

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:33.680
Let's just leave it like that.

01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:34.680
You know what?

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.120
It's like trying to gain one level in Final Fantasy XI.

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:38.400
It's a lot of fucking grinding.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.760
That's a great analogy.

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.360
That's a fantastic analogy.

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.520
Yes, and it's accurate, too.

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:50.960
Because, I mean, for me, I can't stand to play with more than two people at a time,

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.040
because I'm like, you're going too fast!

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:59.120
So just doing all of that would be like, eeee, wince.

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:03.740
I will say, though, despite all the crap I give Final Fantasy XI years out, I am super,

01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:06.240
super excited for Final Fantasy XIV.

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.960
Like I'm already seeing that 2010 will be the year I finally quit WoW, because we'll

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.880
have Final Fantasy XIV and we'll have Star Trek Online.

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:16.040
Star Trek Online is going to completely murder any free time I have.

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.040
I know.

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.040
That's what I'm looking at, too.

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:19.040
I'm going to command a fucking ship.

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:21.920
Did you see what they did to the Borg?

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.280
I've been very good about not looking at any previews for it, because I want to poop my

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:31.080
pants from shock and awe the first day I play it.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:37.320
I think that I farted a little bit.

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:42.800
To use your analogy, Rob.

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.280
Don't pin that analogy on me.

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.280
That's all you.

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.720
No, you're the one who said you were going to poop your pants.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.520
I just used your same analogy.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.920
Alright, fine.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.840
They did cool stuff.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:56.520
So the Borg made you shard a little bit.

01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:02.360
Anyway, like some of the stuff that they were talking about is like they were trying to

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:06.120
make it to where you could not go back from assimilation, that like they replace your

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.120
stomach.

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.120
Wow.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:11.560
Because you don't really need to eat when you have a regeneration cycle.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.760
I'm like, wow, these people are geeky on a level that is far beyond my comprehension.

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.700
So the Borg won't sh- never mind.

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.320
They can't shit.

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:21.320
I wasn't going to go there.

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.160
Unless they're going to throw up some energy at you or something.

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.800
They're going to fart sparks.

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.800
Resistance is futile.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.600
Pooped!

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.720
This was the moment when OLR got flushed down the toilet.

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.600
That's the moment when the episode literally and figuratively went down the-

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:45.600
Hey, I see a shark.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.600
Let's jump it.

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:47.600
Hey!

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:52.880
Rest in peace, Orange Launch Radio, 2002-2009.

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.760
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:59.520
Jamie, can you take us in a non-poopy direction, please?

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:04.200
Um, sorry, I'm still laughing my ass off.

01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.320
I'm laughing my ass off, so no more pooping.

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:08.480
Are you laughing at what Salacious Pop is saying in chat?

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.480
I'm not looking.

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:15.000
They poop Sound Blaster cards from 1998 and laugh at you when they crash your Win 95.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.640
I lolled.

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.400
That's pretty, pretty damn funny.

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.200
Oh, anyway, okay, so, how about some Tatsunoko vs. Capcom news?

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:24.200
Yes, please.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.640
Because Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is sexy.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:36.640
Um, so yeah, actually, um, there is something on one of the Mad Cat's, um, employees' flicker

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:45.440
that is a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fighting stick, so that you can actually, uh, play fighting

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:50.560
games without having to contort your fingers to actually use the damn Wii controller, even

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.560
the classic controller.

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.560
I was going to say, the classic controller is not terrible.

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.280
But it's not great.

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:59.880
It's like trying to play fighting games on the SNES, unless you were dealing with something

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:00.880
with only four buttons.

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.240
But I actually, I was quite fond of Street Fighter II on the SNES, you know?

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:07.920
So it was like, well, keep in mind, when I bought my SNES, the first game I went out

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:12.080
and got, well, besides Kirby's Avalanche, was Super Street Fighter II.

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.320
Now, I'm with Dark Tetsuya, though, that would be awesome to have even for virtual console

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.200
games or a few arcade games.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:25.680
Well, anyway, the theory is that it could be possible that it's going to, uh, be a bundle,

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:31.040
like a normal and then arcade bundle, um, like, uh, Street Fighter IV had.

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.320
So, and it looks, it looks really nice.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.320
I hope so.

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.160
I mean, because honestly, you know what's funny is that playing fighting games at home,

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:44.280
I actually do prefer to play on a good controller over playing it on a joystick just because

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:47.760
of, um, some of my hand problems.

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.080
But I would, I would seriously, I would seriously get this.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.080
It's sexy.

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.160
There's a, everybody else's face is covered except for, you know, that crack coach in

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.160
Lee.

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.880
But right at the very top of it is Owashi no Ken, and he, he is so cool.

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:09.080
I'm kind of surprised at all the love that Tatsunoko versus Capcom is getting, um, getting

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.240
from Capcom.

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.040
I kind of assumed that they were going to release this, like they were kind of throwing

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:17.680
us a fricking bone, but it really seems like they're giving this an Uber release here.

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:18.680
Like they're really trying.

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:24.160
Keep in mind, I mean, yeah, maybe not many people over here in the US have heard of Kagaki

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.160
Ninja Taigajamon, right?

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:31.040
But they've heard of Battle of the Planets, they've heard of G-Force, they've heard of

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.120
even Eagle Riders.

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:39.200
I mean, for all the anime fans, Gatchaman, the OAVs got a release, um, Kashan got an

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:45.920
OAV release, um, Hurricane Polymer, uh, Tekkaman, all of those, I mean, these are names that

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:51.840
are known in a lot of the, the, uh, anime slash video game industry, I guess, or, you

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:52.840
know, fan base.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.840
I'll give you that.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.560
I mean, this is definitely is catered to the anime convention going crowd, but there's

01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:00.680
a damn lot of anime convention going people, you know what I mean?

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:03.400
And there's enough people that would take interest in a game like this.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.800
Do you see this evil book?

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:05.800
Um, Amano.

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:08.000
I have the giant book of Amano.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.880
He did the character designs for Gatchaman and a lot of the early Tachinoko characters.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.560
So I'll find it and put the picture up.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.120
All right.

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:18.120
Sounds good.

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.120
Oh, here we go.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.120
I opened right to it.

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.120
What'd you open to?

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.120
What are you showing me?

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.120
Oh, those are, those are pretty.

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.120
Oh, some of the characters.

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:25.120
I see.

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:26.120
Here.

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.120
Oh, okay.

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.120
Very cool.

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:29.120
This makes for great radio, by the way.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.120
Can I just point out?

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.120
Okay.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.120
Very cool.

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.120
Take a picture.

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:34.120
I'm gonna put a picture up.

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:35.120
All right.

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:36.120
Meanwhile, Loki, let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:37.120
Yes.

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:41.240
There's a new Xbox Live Arcade game going to be coming out March 2010.

01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:45.840
It's called Scourge Project, and it's a third person shooter game.

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:50.060
It will be coming out on Steam, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network.

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:53.420
And what's kind of notable about it is it actually looks really good.

01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:56.560
And it's being powered by the Unreal 3 engine.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:00.860
It's kind of a co-op shooter game where they've got four different storylines with each player,

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:05.740
you know, being able to, in the team, you can play as four different players, and then

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:10.000
you can have a unique perspective on the story with each player that you play as.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.560
And they've also got online deathmatch for up to 16 players as well.

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:18.720
And I don't know, it looks pretty awesome.

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.240
Really high quality for even, like, an Xbox Live Arcade game.

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.280
You know, kind of almost something that I would expect from a console, just a standard

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.860
disc release.

01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:31.680
But something to definitely look forward to.

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:35.640
It was actually announced back in 2007, but I guess it took them this long to actually

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.000
get it finished.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.400
But eh, whatever.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:44.960
And like I said, it's scheduled to arrive March 2010, so it's going to be pretty awesome.

01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:45.960
All right.

01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:51.600
Well, something you can get much sooner than March 2010 is some more crap for your Xbox

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:52.600
Live avatar.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.600
That's right.

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.420
If you love dressing up your virtual Barbie with, you know, spending nickels and dimes

01:44:57.420 --> 01:45:01.520
here and there on new outfits and things like that, guess what you can get now very soon?

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.520
Animals!

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:05.200
Cute fuzzy widow animals!

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:06.200
That's right.

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.000
You can get a dog or a pug dog or a dog in a bag.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.680
I'm assuming that's like a Paris Hilton dog.

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:11.680
Bag dog.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.680
Yeah, bag dog.

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:16.920
You can get a cat, a Siamese cat, a long haired cat, or if you're not a cat or dog person,

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:23.000
you can get a goldfish, a guinea pig, monkey, bird, snake, or you can get a pony.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
That's right.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.520
If you've always wanted a pony, you can now have one for the low, low cost of 240 Microsoft

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:28.700
points.

01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.920
In the real world, that's $3.

01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:33.520
$3 for a virtual pet.

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:34.680
That's your thing.

01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:35.680
Have fun.

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:37.400
What can I do with this virtual pet?

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:38.400
Um,

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.400
Or is it just going to be like a handbag, like, you know, I have the dog.

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:48.760
Well you can see a little picture of the avatar with the dog and I guess they, they pet it.

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:49.760
Um,

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:50.760
Can I have multiple animals?

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.600
The dog probably barks, but not really because I don't think the avatars make sound.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600
They should allow you to have multiple animals.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:59.280
Like, I want to be a virtual cat woman in the game and have like 800 cats.

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:01.440
Did you just say you want to be a virtual cat woman?

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.560
Did I hear that correctly?

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.560
Cat lady.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.400
Not cat woman as in like, you know.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:09.960
Just hearing you talking about your dream of being a cat lady is kind of amusing to

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:10.960
me.

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.920
It's like an avatar because you like, you flip over and see what your friends are doing

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:22.080
and all of a sudden it's like, what the fuck is, is there a person under all those cats?

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:23.080
Oh, I want to see.

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:24.080
I see.

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:25.080
You don't want to be like Michelle Pfeiffer.

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:26.080
No, no, no.

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:27.080
God.

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.200
You want to be the lady that lives in the shoe that has 500 cats that you hear about.

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.200
What's in the shoe?

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:33.200
You hear about.

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:34.200
She has so many cats.

01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.200
She didn't know what to do.

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:39.440
I've maybe combined a couple of things there, but she's the lady you see on the news that,

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:44.360
you know, she died in the house and all the cats like, you know, ate her and then, you

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:47.520
know, suddenly the SPCA doesn't know what to do with all these cats, so they're trying

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:50.200
to find home, homes for 500 cats.

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:52.240
500 human eating cats.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.240
Exactly.

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.840
I can find a home for them.

01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:00.160
Our prison system.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.160
But they're adorable.

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:07.560
By the way, I just want to point out, people are actually going to spend money on this.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.560
That's right.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.000
People will spend $3 so that they can have a cutesy little pet.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Here's my problem.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
It just goes to you.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
I want to make a point.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
This is very important.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.320
This just proves my point, and I've said this before on the show.

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:26.880
This will make money because America loves cats.

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:29.040
But the cat they have is the Siamese cat.

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.040
That's unacceptable.

01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.040
There's more.

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.040
There's other cats, too.

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.040
No, there's just the Siamese cat.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.040
There's the long-haired cat.

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.620
Oh, well, I don't have a long-haired cat.

01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:37.440
I want a cat that looks like my cat.

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:41.240
I have Shermie that sheds enough for 50 cats.

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:46.880
By the way, the Final Fight Guy pictures are up at the Orange Zones Radio Gallery.

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:52.020
I want a guy cat that wears an orange jumpsuit and karate kicks intruders.

01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:54.080
That's what I want.

01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:57.320
That I might pay $3 for.

01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.200
Whatever.

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:00.200
It's your money.

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:01.720
Spend it on whatever makes you happy.

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:02.720
That's what I say.

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.720
Hey, now's the part of the show that we're going to get to the mailbag, and we're going

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:10.080
to open up the old mailbag and see what's in there and read some emails.

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.080
Although, I don't know if we...

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.760
At last, I went in there before the show started.

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:13.760
We didn't have a damn thing.

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:14.760
We got two things, Rob.

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:15.760
Woo!

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:16.760
Jack and shit.

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:17.760
Oh, I thought we actually had an email.

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:18.760
Nope.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.080
Well, part of that probably has to do with the fact that we didn't get a show last week

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.700
up because of internal problems, so big whoops.

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:29.520
This will serve as a reminder, though, that you can always email our show mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:35.000
Funny how that works, that sometimes we get like 100 Twitters like we got tonight, and

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
then no emails.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.360
And then some nights we'll have like 50 emails and no Twitters or something else.

01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:41.800
All right, so we'll roll over.

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:42.800
And don't email us now.

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:43.800
It's going to do no good.

01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:44.800
You missed your chance.

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:45.800
So we'll roll them over to next week.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.440
So there you go.

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:50.320
But there's always time for ranting.

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:53.920
And usually right after the mailbag, we take a moment to rant about something, and this

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:54.920
week's no different.

01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:12.760
We had the FUs of the Week.

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:17.520
We have a story tonight to inspire the FUs, just to get your ranting warmed up a little

01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:18.520
bit.

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:27.240
And that is that a Florida father apparently was arrested and thrown in a slammer for getting

01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:34.360
high, gaming all night long, and then falling asleep on his seven-month-old daughter, which

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:36.880
suffocated the poor thing to death.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:40.080
His name, Emanuel Lawrence, 30.

01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.200
And he finished a marathon game session at 6 a.m., and he laid her on the bed next to

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:47.440
him, rolled over, and dot, dot, dot.

01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:50.120
I don't need to describe what else happened.

01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:52.120
This makes me angry for two reasons.

01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:56.240
One, I think it's pretty obvious he was an idiot.

01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:01.320
Two, I'm seeing this on game blogs, and with all due respect to the lovely people that

01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:05.400
work very hard on game blogs, this story has nothing to do with gaming, and it shouldn't

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.240
... This guy's an idiot.

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:09.240
That's the problem.

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:13.320
I mean, the fact that he was gaming all night long, he could have just been easily watching

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.240
movies or doing something else.

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:18.520
It has nothing to do with games, so don't run it on the game blogs, because it just

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:23.400
supports that notion that somehow it was connected to the games, when we all know it wasn't.

01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:25.800
He was just a stupid, stupid head.

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.740
A stupid, stupid head.

01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:31.120
And for that, he can go live with the 500 human-eating cats, for all I care.

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.560
Dark Soccer, your FUs of the Week, please.

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:38.520
FU to the wimpy California people.

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.760
It's just a little snow.

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.880
If you really don't... I'm excited.

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:44.920
I'm not really excited either.

01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:47.240
I actually feel really indifferent about the whole thing.

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:52.600
I'm just like... Well, I suppose it's novel, but at the same time, I'm like, dude, if you're

01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:55.720
afraid of people on the road, don't go out.

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.840
If you have to go to work, drive safely.

01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:58.840
Stick to the slow lane.

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.840
I'm going to call in snow to work tomorrow.

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.280
Well, they also sent us that warning.

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:07.100
And by the way, thank you for sending me the warning while I'm in the middle of doing really

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:08.100
good stitches.

01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:09.800
And also, fuck this hat.

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:11.200
Hi, husband!

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.240
Low-key, your FUs of the Week, please.

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:14.240
My husband just arrived.

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:18.360
Um, FU to people trying to sell me shit at my house.

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:22.840
I hate hearing the doorbell ring and going to the door and not recognizing the person.

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:26.200
I always assume that maybe it's a kid that threw a ball into our backyard or something

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:30.820
like that, and the dumb me answers the door, and it's always someone trying to sell shit

01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:34.600
or someone that wants cams for me to donate to them for shit.

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:37.480
I don't have your fucking... Are you sure you don't want a subscription to the SACB?

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:38.480
No, I don't want a subscription.

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.480
Because if you don't subscribe, I'm going to die.

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:42.480
You're like, well, you... I'm not going to be able to go on my trip.

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:47.800
I'm going to get my $1,000 scholarship, I'm going to be stupid!

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:48.800
I don't give a fuck.

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.840
You're an idiot already if you think that you're going to get a $1,000 scholarship from

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:57.160
the SACB for walking door-to-door to sell their fucking subscription.

01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:58.600
You're an idiot.

01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:03.120
Maybe you should have been smarter in the first place, and you wouldn't have to walk

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:09.320
door-to-door selling subscriptions to newspapers and said you'd be earning a scholarship from,

01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:14.200
I don't know, someone that celebrates academic excellence.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:15.200
You're an idiot.

01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.000
And I don't want your fucking SACB subscriptions.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.520
I don't care how you give them to me.

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:21.520
Get the fuck out!

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:27.400
Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm in a pretty good mood today, so I don't really have a lot of FUs.

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.360
I guess FU to traffic.

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:33.280
Like people driving to San Francisco don't know what they're doing and need to stop.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.280
Get off my bridge.

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:37.840
FU, FU to the S-curve on the bridge, too, for slowing everything down.

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:41.080
Well, you know, a lot of people, a lot of trucks have been running off of it.

01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:42.080
Did you hear about that?

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:43.080
Yeah, I've heard about that.

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:48.280
Then drive carefully, but don't, you know, it's just, it's not that that slows things

01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:49.280
down.

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:50.760
It's people cutting in and out of lanes.

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:51.760
That's what slows things down.

01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:52.760
I agree.

01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.920
That shit needs to be illegal at a certain point.

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:57.960
And like they need to do the thing where they put the bumps in the road that are so high,

01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:00.160
you can't cross them.

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:04.600
And Kate, unless it's like a real emergency or something, you know, it's just ridiculous.

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:09.040
And they should have a way that if you do happen to be stupid enough to drive off the

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.560
edge that you die.

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:15.400
There should be grinders and explosions at the bottom of the hill.

01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:19.920
And most importantly, human-eating cats living in the bay.

01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:22.320
That's what they did at Alcatraz, actually.

01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.820
That's how people didn't escape Alcatraz.

01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:25.360
They had human-eating cats in the water.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.360
Cat sharks.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.360
That's right.

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:28.360
Cat sharks.

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:29.360
True story.

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.360
Look it up.

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:31.360
That's right.

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:32.360
It's on Wikipedia.

01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:33.360
Quick, put it on Wikipedia.

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.360
We've got some good stories for you guys and then we're going to get to your stories on

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.800
our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:39.440
But first, some Skype stories.

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:41.080
Some Skype stories?

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.080
What the hell?

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:45.160
The Skype line, then some last stories before we get to the Skype line.

01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.160
Say what?

01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:47.160
I'm dyslexic today.

01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:48.160
It's crazy.

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:53.460
I'm putting up the last of the Amano pictures right now.

01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:54.460
So they should be up.

01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.460
Run.

01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:56.460
Go look.

01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:57.460
Quick.

01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:02.960
Well, if you're in Japan, there's definitely your share of adult games available out there.

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:12.160
And yes, one of these adult games, which features women with extremely large breasts, very unnaturally

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:19.000
large breasts, but more power to them for that, and comes from Willowsoft.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:26.600
Well, this game you can also get with a collector's edition that's bundled with a special manga,

01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:29.720
an audio CD, and a personal assistant.

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:34.840
No, that's not a person that takes down notation for you and brings you coffee.

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:37.480
It is a pocket pussy.

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:39.840
It is a rubber thing that you put your penis in.

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:42.360
A fleshlight, basically?

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.360
Without the fleshlight.

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.360
No, no.

01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:45.360
They're called ona cups.

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.360
As in woman cup.

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:48.360
Wow.

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:50.960
Just go to Jlist and look at all this stuff.

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:51.960
I seriously sell all this stuff.

01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:52.960
I really don't need to.

01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:53.960
I just don't.

01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:54.960
They have commercials for them.

01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:55.960
It's hilarious.

01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:57.440
My life will be fine without it, actually.

01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.260
I think it's funny looking at the commercials.

01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:03.800
And it will be released during Christmas on the 25th.

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:05.480
Just in time for the holidays.

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:06.480
Just what I always wanted.

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.920
A pocket pussy to take with me.

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:12.920
I did love, though, you gotta share the artwork for the game with our chatters, because I

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:17.640
love the unnaturally large breasts that the women had.

01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:22.800
They were larger than Springer Large, like Jerry Springer's show, when he has the women

01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.460
with the unnaturally large titties.

01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:25.520
That's gonna cause some back pain.

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.720
That's a Z cup.

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:27.720
That's some back pain.

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:30.120
I can't believe she doesn't walk over with a hunch.

01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:35.240
I mean, that is just amazing.

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:41.200
That is some serious, seriously large boobies there.

01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.560
Hey, and you know, and I kinda laugh at some of the stuff that I've seen, you know, like

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:55.840
they've got the booby pillows or the booby mouse pads and stuff like that, but that's

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.520
just a little much, I mean.

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.280
Sorry I'm laughing at a comment in chat.

01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.480
Salacious Pop comments, I'd carry a pocket pussy with me, but only to give friends sudden

01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:09.400
nose kisses.

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:13.660
Oh my god, if someone did that to me, I think I'd slap them.

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:15.880
Although the mental image is really funny.

01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:19.160
Can you imagine walking up to someone, I kiss you!

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:21.920
Wow, their website is sure detailed.

01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:22.920
What?

01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:27.480
Oh, and I guess they have different ones depending on which woman that you want to, you know.

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:30.080
Oh well, whoopee!

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.200
Like different depths and widths and everything?

01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:33.200
No, differently.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:34.200
Are they all loose?

01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.200
They're all different.

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:36.200
The women in this game, clearly.

01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:40.120
They've got different patterns in there, see, you know, you've got the one chick there,

01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:44.600
the blue, and it's got like, looks like nubs and ribs and then something else.

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:48.720
That looks like, okay, that looks like a diagram that you see in a geology book about what

01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:51.480
it would look like if you drilled to the center of the earth.

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.240
That's what that looks like to me.

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.040
Oh, well you're drilling to the center of the earth, alright.

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.040
Shut up, you ass.

01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:01.480
And then that one right there looks like a spine and a screw at the top there.

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.120
It does, it looks like an MRI picture.

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:09.720
And that one's got kind of like, you know, some sort of DNA helix thing going on there.

01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:12.320
Wait a minute, is this radio really happening right now?

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:14.400
We're describing pocket pussies on our radio program?

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.240
You're right, that's not going to help our chat room, I gotta link this into the chat

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.240
room.

01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:19.240
Yes you do.

01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:21.240
The commercials, the commercials are hilarious.

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:23.240
No, thank you.

01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:27.520
Well, you know, Rob, they do make vibrators.

01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:35.080
Oh, it was funny, the other day we were watching and I, you know, this is the perfect use of

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:36.080
our PS3.

01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:42.320
Oh, and then of course in the one that looks like they're underage of course is in there.

01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:43.320
You gotta love that.

01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:44.320
Yay.

01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:50.600
No, there is like, they had like an interactive device or whatever that you would buy for

01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.760
your PC that's 4.0 use or whatever, but it's interactive, you see, because it's synced

01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.760
up with whatever's on the computer.

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:02.480
Technology, gotta love it.

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:04.480
Holy moly.

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:09.680
I just got a picture of Marissa and she said, were the boobies bigger than mine?

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:11.740
Not by much.

01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:12.740
Not by much.

01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:13.740
That's an impressive picture.

01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:15.040
Marissa has the best rack ever.

01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:18.220
That is an impressive picture.

01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:22.960
I just want to, like, I am, I am completely secure in my homosexuality, okay?

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.400
I am 100% secure in my, my fagness, but I want to like bury my face in that.

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.880
Like, I can't explain it.

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:36.840
That's because you have something that's built into male DNA, whether you're gay or not,

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:39.000
that boobies are important.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.560
Were you breastfed, Rob?

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:41.800
I know.

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:42.800
That could be part of it.

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:43.800
I don't know.

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:44.800
I do.

01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:46.400
Quit trying to make it sound like it's like a psychological thing.

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.480
It's much more basic than that.

01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:50.680
Yeah, it looks like they do have multiple box sets.

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:52.720
Rob, Rob, it's because boobies are fun.

01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:53.720
The boobies are fun.

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:56.240
That's what it boils down to.

01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.920
You guys are going to have to get her to post the link if you want to see it, because now

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:06.440
all the chat is like, link, link, link, link, please, please link, link, please.

01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:08.640
And Marissa says gay man motorboat me all the time.

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:13.320
I tell you, if you post that link in chat, it's going to get really quiet and chat for

01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:16.720
about the next five minutes.

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:20.440
Anyhow, one more story for you guys.

01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:25.120
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, and we're going to travel

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:27.880
the world here a little bit and go to Brazil.

01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:31.200
And it sounds like Brazil is following in the footsteps of some other places around

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.400
the world.

01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:40.000
It's the home of a recently proposed bill coming from Senator Vladir Raup, and this

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:44.240
bill was recently passed by the Education Commission of the Brazilian Senate and is

01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:48.080
now about to be voted on by the Committee of Constitution and Justice.

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:52.720
And what they're trying to do, they're trying to, quote, curb the manufacture, distribution,

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:57.840
importation, distribution, yes, it's in there twice, trading in custody, storage of the

01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:02.620
video games that affect the customs and traditions of the people, their worship, creeds, religions

02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:03.620
and symbols.

02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:08.120
In other words, they're basically trying to eliminate video games in bad taste, which

02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:13.960
could be violent video games and, you know, lots of things among that route.

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:14.960
You know what?

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:17.600
They've tried to do that many places and it never works.

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:22.620
Of course, Brazil isn't this country, but, you know, I just, it would be sad to hear

02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:27.480
about that, so.

02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:32.640
Just learn from, you can't stop freedom of expression.

02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:38.360
I mean, as much as this, like, fleshlight pocket pussy thing is ridiculous, I love the

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:40.360
fact that it can be made.

02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.500
You know what I mean?

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:44.560
The fact that it exists brings me lols.

02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:47.080
So, all right.

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:53.960
Anyhow, we're going to go to the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype

02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:54.960
is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:58.920
If you want to give us a call, we're going to take some calls right now.

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:02.280
The Skype line is open for business, taking your calls.

02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:05.920
In the meantime, some last-minute stories while we wait for the little delay there.

02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:06.920
Loki, I don't know if you have anything to say.

02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:07.920
I have one.

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:08.920
Oh, yes.

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:09.920
Dark Sakura.

02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:10.920
Boobs are great.

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:11.920
The end.

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:12.920
And we're getting a call, so let's take the phone.

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:13.920
Hello.

02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:14.920
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:15.920
Who's this?

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:16.920
Hi.

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:17.920
This is Spazinator.

02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:18.920
Hi, Spazinator.

02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:19.920
What's on your mind tonight?

02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:20.920
Two things.

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:30.840
You know, first, so far, this episode has kind of been the best episode of OLR so far.

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.680
Well, thank you very much.

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:34.920
Is it because it's very porn-tastic tonight?

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:35.920
I'm sorry.

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:41.000
You know, with my ear infection, it's kind of hard to hear you.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.240
Could you repeat that for me?

02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:43.240
That's all right.

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.560
Is it because we're porn-tastic tonight?

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:45.560
Oh, yeah.

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:48.300
I mean, you know, not too sad.

02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:49.800
You cover your what?

02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:53.120
Boobs, vaginas, and bodily functions.

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:57.440
I mean, yeah, there's probably stuff for you.

02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.200
Nothing, but you can't think of it off the top of my head.

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:02.640
The gay man in me is ashamed tonight.

02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:05.880
I feel like I need to go blow someone after the show, but anyhow.

02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:15.640
Well, yeah, to get to the main point of my call, yeah, I kind of wanted to touch on something

02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:19.360
that you were mentioning towards the beginning of the show.

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:20.360
Yeah.

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:28.360
Well, you know, I mean, with the whole rumor of the PSP Go add-on, and it can relate to

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:35.280
the whole, you know, I don't know what you want to call it, flunkers in town, and the

02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:41.520
motion controller for the PSP, you know, PS3 as well in the sense, it's probably a good

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:49.640
idea that the PSP add-on doesn't come out, simply because of one simple reason.

02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:58.120
Traditionally speaking, add-ons, for instance, do really, really horrible in terms of sales

02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:59.120
and whatnot.

02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:13.320
Classic examples are the Sega CD, the 32X, and more recently, the 360 HD DVD add-on,

02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:16.640
and the PlayStation 2's hard drive.

02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:19.840
You know, that did loudly.

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:27.840
The simple reason for that is that, you know, add-ons, you know, kind of like, flunk through

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:40.440
the market a little bit, and game manufacturers can't rely on people buying these add-ons,

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:47.720
and therefore, you know, they tend to shy away from catering to these add-ons.

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.620
There's a lot of add-ons that don't do very well, because they're not very well supported.

02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:53.920
They're made for, like, one game, and then that's it.

02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:56.600
You know, you can go back through gaming's history, and there's just tons of stuff that

02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:59.120
just wasn't very well supported.

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:05.280
The Super Scope 6, but some were also very good on the other side, because they got a

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:09.800
lot of support for them, like DDR mats did very well, because the games that, you know,

02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:10.800
came out with them.

02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.320
There was a ton of them, and, you know, folks got use out of them, and the guitar peripherals

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:15.320
do very well, too.

02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:19.480
But don't forget, too, the biggest difference here, when you're talking about the PSP, and

02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:22.160
what we're talking about at the beginning of the show, is that you're having an add-on

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:23.880
for something that should have been there in the first place.

02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:28.240
It's ridiculous that, you know, you would get this add-on if you, what, just go buy

02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:30.520
the PSP 3000 if you want a UMD.

02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:32.520
It makes no sense at all.

02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:33.520
Yeah.

02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:45.560
Yeah, you definitely got a point there, in both cases, and also, you know, like you mentioned,

02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:54.840
the DDR mats and Rock Band, Guitar Hero stuff, you know, does so well, but you gotta be reminded

02:04:54.840 --> 02:05:01.520
that that kind of stuff is kind of being a minority, in a sense, and the companies that

02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:07.720
put those stuff out are taking, like, a really, really major risk with that stuff.

02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:16.360
And in terms of, like, Project Metal and Sony's motion controller, sure, I'm willing to bet

02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:22.320
that there will be some early adopters that will probably get it for the novelty of it,

02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:28.720
and probably wouldn't use that stuff for a while, up until the novelty wears off.

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:29.720
Well, you know what?

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:30.720
Peripherals?

02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:34.960
I understand peripherals give sometimes developers, I think right now, a false sense of security

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:40.200
because DDR's done so well, because Guitar Hero's done so well, but I think Tony Hawk

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:43.920
at the right is gonna bring him right back to reminding folks that peripherals don't

02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:47.840
always make the game, that's for sure, and especially the amount that folks spend on

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:48.840
it.

02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:49.840
Yeah, true.

02:05:49.840 --> 02:06:02.040
Yeah, the only reason the Wii remote did well is because, in a sense, Nintendo got it right

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:04.520
where they packed the stuff in.

02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:06.520
Right, and that was the system.

02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:10.120
Every single game has to support it, therefore there's plenty of games out there that support

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:11.120
it.

02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:14.240
But it's very interesting, isn't it, that sometimes folks' complaints about the Wii

02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:18.240
is that they should make some games that don't support it, you know, that don't overdo it

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:19.880
with the motion controls.

02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:21.600
The Wii's been very interesting.

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:22.600
Very interesting.

02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:27.080
Spaznator, I gotta wrap up and let you go here so we can get some more calls.

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:29.360
Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners?

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:32.160
Uh, no, not that I can go.

02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:33.440
Alright, well thank you.

02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:34.440
Have a good one.

02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:38.000
Yeah, thanks as always for the call, Spaznator, and I hope you were able to dig yourself out

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.760
of the snow that you get there, just like we'll have to dig ourselves out tomorrow morning.

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:42.760
Alright.

02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:43.760
Alright.

02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:44.760
Take care.

02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:50.920
Um, we're gonna get some more calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,

02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:52.680
and we'll get to calls in just a moment.

02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:56.120
I don't know if, uh, Loki had any last minute stories you wanted to do real quick?

02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:57.120
Yeah, sure.

02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:00.200
Um, Mirror's Edge is gonna be coming to the iPhone soon.

02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:02.360
It's a little bit different than normal Mirror's Edge.

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:07.440
It's actually kind of more of a side-scroll game, but it's, uh, still 3D, and it looks

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:08.440
neat.

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:11.080
Uh, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:12.320
It's Ranma one more time.

02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:13.320
Hi, Ranma, what's on your mind?

02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:15.320
Lucky you, getting through two weeks in a row.

02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:16.320
Not too much.

02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:21.240
Um, couple of quick things, I'll be on my merry little way, um, first thing is, I don't

02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:26.760
know if you saw, but I had made a retweet about President Katz coming to the US.

02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:27.760
Uh huh.

02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:28.760
Did you see that?

02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:30.760
No, wait, like, for real?

02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:36.800
Well, someone on Twitter goes, going by the name of smap454, his name is Matt Cox, made

02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:40.520
a tweet to Ranma Wee saying that President Katz coming to the US.

02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:41.520
Uh huh.

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:46.360
And I retweeted it, but it just kind of fell right in the water, so I don't know if you

02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:47.360
guys had heard about it.

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:48.360
When was it?

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.360
Was it today?

02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:51.760
No, actually, this was about three days ago.

02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:55.360
No, I didn't see it, I've been bad on keeping current on Twitter.

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:57.040
Would I see it on Ranma Wee's Twitter?

02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:01.480
Yes, and I actually have, I actually have the Twitter, um, page up, I can put it in

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:07.360
the chat room, and even though it makes for great radio, it's Twitter.com slash smat454.

02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:11.960
Well, wait, now they're saying President Katz, the revolution is coming to the US, that's

02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:16.200
just, they're just talking about the, the, the fever, President Katz fever, I don't think

02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:17.200
they mean a game.

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.960
Because, like, yeah, if you look at a couple tweets before that, they're saying President

02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:24.880
Katz for the win, we need President Katz, I don't think they're talking about the actual

02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:25.880
game.

02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:26.880
I wish.

02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:27.880
It's probably a listener to this program.

02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:32.040
Probably so, but when it came across to my feed, I'm automatically, assuming, so I picked

02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:36.000
up the rights to the game, it's coming over, you know?

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
I wish.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.840
If these stories about the fact that it only sold 100 copies are true, maybe it won't happen,

02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:44.600
but, you know, again, I gotta be careful, I don't want to make this the President Katz

02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:48.680
show, but my point still stands, this game would sell if it came out here, and it will

02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:50.920
sell much more than 100 copies.

02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:53.400
I mean, hell, they made a sequel to We Cheer.

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:54.400
I know, right?

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:57.920
Like, get their, and muscle, hello, Muscle March.

02:08:57.920 --> 02:08:58.920
End of argument.

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:03.120
Yeah, yeah, you, yeah, you got a valid point on that one, yeah.

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:04.120
Exactly.

02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:07.600
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, DJ Rama?

02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:08.600
Something interesting.

02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:14.560
Saturday, I called Best Buy, I had an issue about my TV set, but at the same time, my

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:19.280
360s acted kind of odd, so then I called them to see if I could get it replaced, which is

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:20.280
not a problem.

02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:24.360
So I asked them another question, because it seems that another one of my coworkers,

02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:30.040
he has a 360 with a two-year coverage by Best Buy, and they're refusing to take his 360

02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:33.300
because it's the Red Ring of Death, so I asked them about that.

02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:38.520
It seems that now, when you buy your Xbox 360 from Best Buy, you know you get the two-year

02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:39.880
black type protection?

02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:41.640
It does not cover the Red Ring of Death.

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:46.040
Now, if you already have the coverage, you're good, provided that you bought your console

02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:49.520
before, I believe, September of 2008.

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:53.460
I'd actually, I want to say I've heard of this before, and it's because the Red Rings

02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:56.220
are covered under Microsoft's warranty, and Best Buy don't want to have anything to do

02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:57.220
with it anymore.

02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:00.120
Well, it looks like I got lucky with my Red Ring.

02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.400
Well, the thing is also, I mean, if there are anything like what we have to deal with,

02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:09.360
Microsoft is telling us to tell our customers that they need to go through Microsoft to

02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:11.120
get that system fixed.

02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:14.540
So there's no point in returning it back to the place you bought it.

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:18.400
You need to go send it to Microsoft, because all they're going to end up doing is having

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:25.840
to send it back to Microsoft anyways, and really, it's the way you need to do it anyways.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:26.840
True.

02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:31.360
So the funny thing is, I mean, I used to work for them, and under this coverage, if someone

02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:35.320
brought the console back, whatever console it was, Best Buy would still get the full

02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:38.120
credit on it anyway, back from the manufacturer.

02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:41.080
So that's the part that kind of threw me off for a long time.

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:42.080
Maybe I'm not anymore, though.

02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:43.080
I don't know.

02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:44.080
I don't think.

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.080
Strange.

02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:49.480
All right, well, Rama, thank you so much for the call, and thanks for the heads up on Best

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:50.880
Buy, if folks didn't already know.

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:53.680
It's something to think about, especially this holiday season, as you're buying people

02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:54.680
Xboxes.

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:58.520
The thing to think of possibly as a reason why they wouldn't take it back, too, is they

02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:03.320
could just say, oh yeah, Red Ringed, and in reality, their console got banned.

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:04.320
Don't.

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:08.320
Yeah, because the thing is, they're supposed to pop open the consoles and test it out and

02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:12.520
make sure Red Ringed or whatever, because that's what I did when I worked at Geeksfella,

02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:15.120
so I brought back defective PS2s and Xboxes.

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:19.680
When I showed my 360 in the box, they took it, grabbed me another one off the shelf,

02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:22.240
and I'm like, here you go.

02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:24.960
And it was a slow day, too.

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:25.960
Hmm.

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:26.960
All right.

02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:30.040
Well, we're going to let you go, Rama, so we can get some more calls, but thank you

02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:31.040
guys.

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.040
No problem.

02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:33.520
Thank you so much, as always, for calling in, OK?

02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:34.520
And upon you.

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:35.520
Have a good week.

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.520
Have a good week.

02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:37.520
You too.

02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:38.520
All right.

02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:39.520
877-GAME-OLR.

02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:42.840
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and that's the place to get in on the Skype

02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:46.120
line if you have anything you want to talk about tonight on the program.

02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:47.560
Other last minute stories we have, Logan?

02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:48.560
Yeah, sure.

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:54.120
This is a PlayStation Network game that's going to be nearly 10 gigabytes in size, and

02:11:54.120 --> 02:12:01.880
it's the PlayStation Network title Record of Argressed War, and apparently it's a strategy

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:09.120
RPG, and it's coming to North America by Axis Games localization.

02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:13.600
One of the companies I said to send the President and Cat emails to, because they localize all

02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:18.640
sorts of weird stuff, including this game that has apparently anime chicks seductively

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.320
eating sausages.

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:23.920
Oh, joy and rapture.

02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:25.640
This picture here.

02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:27.040
Too much porn tonight.

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:28.040
Yeah.

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.680
I mean, I know there's no such thing as too much porn, but tonight might be pushing the

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:33.680
limit.

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:34.680
I'm just saying.

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:37.440
I might have to put the explicit tag on tonight's show for once.

02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:38.880
Anyhow, we got another call.

02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:39.880
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:40.880
Who's this?

02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:41.880
Hey, this is X-Link.

02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:42.880
Hey, X-Link.

02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.880
Hey, X-Link.

02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:44.880
Hey, Lauren.

02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:45.880
What are you talking about?

02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:46.880
Clearly I'm smoking crack.

02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:47.880
That means we're Orange Lounge Pornio.

02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:50.920
X-Link, I'm sorry to make you wait there for a little bit, but what's in your mind?

02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:51.920
Hey, no, no problem.

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:52.920
Not at all.

02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:57.760
This has been a great show, everything from snow to boobs to flashlights.

02:12:57.760 --> 02:12:58.760
To snowboob flashlights.

02:12:58.760 --> 02:12:59.760
I know.

02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:00.760
And food.

02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:01.840
It's been an amazing night.

02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:04.600
Well, I found a little bit of information, it was interesting.

02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:07.360
I ran you about this before, and I told you to look this up.

02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:10.420
I don't know if you did or not, but they were talking about Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep,

02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:16.940
of course, is going to be hitting over in Japan on January 9th, but Jesse McCarthy on

02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:22.860
his tweet back about November 30th put up a tweet and says, recording yet another Kingdom

02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:27.140
Hearts game. All you gamers eat your heart out. Man, what a process, though. The first

02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:32.260
recording was in 2005 for game one, which I think they said that actually the first

02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:38.560
game came out in the U.S. in 2002, which then they said part two came out in 2005, but none

02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:42.580
of the last, though, which they're talking about, hopefully that means that we will be

02:13:42.580 --> 02:13:47.900
getting Birth by Sleep here come sometime maybe either middle of next year or possibly

02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:50.780
the year after, so I'm definitely looking forward to that.

02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:54.860
I'm kind of not surprised that, you know, it's making its way over here.

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:58.780
No, not at all, but I'm looking forward to it because it's going to add a lot of

02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:02.740
information to the storyline, especially since it's supposed to be the prequel to what

02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:07.540
all happened for the story, so. And it's supposedly rumors are claiming that it might

02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:12.300
have, like, of course, all the games at the end have that little sneak peek of what's

02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:16.180
going on. It supposedly could possibly have something for maybe, you know, part three.

02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:17.180
So.

02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:20.820
Let's hope. You know I'm all about the Kingdom Hearts part three, but it also makes

02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:24.260
sense, you know, and I think this point got brought up a couple episodes ago is that that

02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:28.820
team has been hard at work on Versus 13, which we've had very little information about,

02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:33.060
so you know that that game is still heavy under development. I think once Versus 13

02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:36.420
finally looks like it's nearing gold status and it's on its way out, which, honestly,

02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:40.700
at this point, I don't think it's going to happen until 2011. I think we'll, I think

02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:45.180
we'll have more. Because, you know, I think, here's my thought, actually, Versus 13, I

02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:49.700
think is going to be a big thing at E3 2010 for Square. Because at that point, Final Fantasy

02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:54.380
13, non-versus, the regular one, will be out. You know, now that we know the release date

02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:59.200
for 13, it'll be out in Japan, it'll be out here in the U.S., that's done now. So,

02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:03.760
I think Versus 13 will be big, and maybe they'll make a Kingdom Hearts announcement, but I

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:08.180
think that that's what's going to be their big thing at E3 this year, is finding more

02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:09.180
on Versus.

02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:13.180
I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. I'm sorry. My prediction would be that the Kingdom

02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:17.900
Hearts, and also there was, they've been showing teasers, especially over in Japan

02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:25.060
for it, but the Parasite Eve, the third birthday, was also, been teased over in Japan, which,

02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:29.500
of course, did very well. The first two did very well over here, I believe, in the U.S.

02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:32.100
Yeah, surprising they never did a third one.

02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:36.180
Well, they're supposed to, and it's supposed to be for PSP, and they already said that

02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:40.060
it was going to come out, but there has been no release dates or anything of the, yeah,

02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:43.980
they're just showing teasers, they had a little teaser, one or two teasers out for

02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:44.980
that, but I'm hoping...

02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:46.740
I still wish they'd translate the book.

02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:51.100
I remember Parasite Eve, I remember a story that we covered on the show, like, it was

02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:53.620
a while ago, probably about a year and a half ago, but I remember this has come up on the

02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:58.100
show before. You know, it's, it's, it's being done, it's just, yeah, and I seem

02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:02.620
to recall it was on the PSP, too, but it's a little weird that that's the direction

02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:06.620
they're going with it, when they could do something, you know, epic on the PS3, but,

02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:12.140
you know, whatever, or 360, whatever they want to do. I, I, I imagine that's something

02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:15.260
they're going to pull out of their hat at E3. I'd be with you there.

02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:18.180
I just, I'm just surprised to see what they will do. I mean, they're just going to try

02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:22.780
to, you know, go for it, you know, so, if they do, that's great, if not, then...

02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:26.900
So, alright, well, excellent, thank you so much for the call, and we're going to let

02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:30.260
you go, so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much, as always, and have a good night,

02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:31.260
okay?

02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:32.260
Of course, thanks.

02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:33.260
Later.

02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:34.260
See you.

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:36.020
That's going to do it for tonight's Skypline. Thank you so much to our callers tonight.

02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:40.140
We really appreciate it. Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight, but it's

02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:45.020
weird. Tonight's show's been moving very fast. We're actually probably going to end a little

02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:48.080
bit earlier than usual, but you know what? It's also that time of year where the games

02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:52.660
are out now, so there's not a whole lot of, you know, people are going to be sleeping

02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:56.100
through December, and we'll get more game news come January, especially with all of

02:16:56.100 --> 02:17:00.380
these postponements. I think first and second quarter 2010 are going to be very interesting.

02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:02.020
First quarter is pretty interesting.

02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:06.140
All these games that got delayed are finally going to come out. It's going to be very interesting.

02:17:06.140 --> 02:17:09.020
But anyhow, we still have some last minute stories, right, Loki?

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:13.960
Yeah, and then, other than Mirror's Edge, there's also some other decent games coming

02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:24.220
to the iPhone, including iPhone, the iPhone version of Ace Combat 11, or XI, I guess.

02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:29.940
It's coming from Namco, of course. It looks pretty awesome. And they're also updating,

02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:35.420
I guess, Guarders and Ghouls, no relation to Ghosts and Goblins.

02:17:35.420 --> 02:17:38.540
I was going to say, that's what it sounds like. Is that like Ghosts and Goblins?

02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:43.860
It's a zombie killing game, and it allows you, they're going to have GPS support now,

02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:48.380
so you can move your iPhone around to turn your player in the game.

02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:54.380
Deft wants to point out that's Ace Combat She, not XI, because Ace Combat 6 was the

02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:56.060
last one, so they wouldn't jump right to XI.

02:17:56.060 --> 02:18:01.780
Yeah, but you never. Okay, so She. And let's see, what else? So Serious Sam, the second

02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:05.420
encounter, is also getting the HD treatment as well. And if I remember correctly, the

02:18:05.420 --> 02:18:13.740
first one still hasn't come out yet, but still, that's kind of neat. So I'm assuming coming

02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:21.340
to the same places as the first game, probably Steam, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live

02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:23.340
Arcade.

02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:33.860
And then finally, Lips Party Classics will be coming out on the Xbox 360 in 2010, apparently

02:18:33.860 --> 02:18:41.820
in the spring. It will feature 40 new tracks, including the Love Shack by the B-52s, Tub

02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:47.820
Thumping by Chubba Wumba, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, Rock and Roll All Night by

02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:54.420
KISS, Wannabe by Spice Girls, I Think We're Alone Now by Tiffany, and YMCA by the Village

02:18:54.420 --> 02:19:03.420
People. And of course, you know, your typical karaoke game.

02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:10.600
And then finally, to kind of elaborate a little bit more on what the Record of Argos War was,

02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:15.620
it's a game that had that soul breed function in there. Basically, you find these women

02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:21.620
and you breed with them to create a new hero.

02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:22.980
Okay.

02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:23.980
I'm bringing it back around.

02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:25.980
I see, yes.

02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:26.980
I see.

02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:27.980
Yeah.

02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.980
Uh-huh.

02:19:28.980 --> 02:19:33.980
That's why she was seductively eating the sausage. It all makes sense now.

02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:39.140
Dot dot dot.

02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:41.140
That's all I've got.

02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:48.300
All right. Anyhow, we're going to wrap up here at Orange Lawns Radio and say goodnight

02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:53.860
and all that fun stuff. DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:54.860
My hands hurt.

02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:55.860
Sorry to hear that.

02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:57.500
Damn hat.

02:19:57.500 --> 02:20:00.580
My hands don't hurt.

02:20:00.580 --> 02:20:04.340
My final thought is, I want a taco. That's my final thought. I think that was my final

02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:07.940
thought last week, but I again want a taco, just so you know. That's going to do it for

02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:10.580
another episode of Orange Lawns Radio. Believe it or not, we're coming to a close. I know

02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:13.740
it's a little early tonight, but like I said, it's a little bit of a slower news week. Not

02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:17.200
as much to discuss as usual. Live listeners though, stay tuned because we have a little

02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:20.380
extra something after the show as usual. For those of you guys listening on the podcast

02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:23.500
though, that's going to do it. Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting our

02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:27.180
program. We really appreciate it. Again, all we ask, we do this stuff for free, so please

02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:30.860
tell two people about the show. I know especially ever since the launch of the Facebook page,

02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:34.460
a lot of you guys have really been selling the show to your friends. We really appreciate

02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:39.220
that and the word of mouth goes a very long way. Just want to let you guys know it's really

02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:43.460
appreciated because we don't really have advertising dollars. We don't have a big magazine supporting

02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:48.740
us. We're not on TV or anything fancy like that. Word of mouth is all we got, so we really

02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:53.660
appreciate it. If you didn't like our program, that's okay. We don't hate you that much,

02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:56.760
but do check out some of the other programs on AllGames.com, some other great independent

02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:00.640
podcasts that talk about other things. If you don't like us because we don't talk enough

02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:04.420
modern warfare, there's a show on there that talks much more about first person shooters

02:21:04.420 --> 02:21:09.900
or whatever might be up your alley. So thank you guys, of course, as always, and we'll

02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:14.700
do it all again next week. Except remember guys, next week, sadly, not live, but it will

02:21:14.700 --> 02:21:19.700
be pre-taped. If we can pre-tape it live, stay tuned to the Twitter and the Facebook

02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:23.420
for all that information. Meanwhile, that's going to do it for another additional Orange

02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:30.420
Lounge Radio. Till next week, I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out!

02:21:53.420 --> 02:22:00.420
See you next week!
