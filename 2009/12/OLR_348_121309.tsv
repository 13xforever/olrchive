13902	24126	Tonight, December 13th, 2009, a retrotastic Mega Man 10 is announced, LittleBigPlanet is about to give Captain Sackboy what famous video game has been adapted for the stage.
31499	35460	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35500	41562	We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41582	48485	And of course we tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
48585	48985	Except...
49525	50445	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
77172	79794	and I think she said something about a pinball party that she's going to.
80375	81936	It's Dan's turn to host the pinball party.
82096	82416	I see.
82817	89402	So I will be probably running away from it tomorrow night to go probably watch Star Trek with Becky.
89702	89942	I see.
89962	91563	We're going to have a special guest next week though.
91643	92624	So it just seems to work out.
92664	92904	Really?
92964	93945	We have a special guest next week?
93985	94305	Who's that?
94486	94786	Who dat?
96190	97571	I'm wondering if I should spoil the surprise.
98132	98733	Oh, okay.
99294	100595	We are going to have Tiara.
101156	101396	Really?
101416	102297	She's going to be here next week?
102438	102598	Yes.
102938	103859	I'm very excited.
104340	105581	So am I. Awesome, awesome.
106182	108765	Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
108946	109306	Hello.
109326	110027	How are you doing, Loki?
110367	110808	Doing fine.
110888	111709	Dingo Digital A320
141071	142172	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
157027	180421	Um, but you can actually run, uh, you know, different emulators including, uh, CPS 1 and 2, which are the Capcom Arcade games, uh, MVS, which is the Neo Geo Arcade games, uh, NES, I wanna say Mega Drive, um, I think Game Boy Advance, those are all the default emulators that are, um, actually in the, uh, system itself, but you can load more stuff on later on.
180722	182883	I was gonna say it doesn't look like an Australian canine.
184344	185746	It doesn't look like it ate a baby either.
186086	187308	It did not eat a baby.
187408	188970	You can also tune in radio on it.
189491	192194	Can you listen to Orange Lounge radio?
192214	194617	You can listen to podcasts because it plays MP3s.
194657	195278	And it has Linux.
196238	197599	I think it's based off Linux.
197699	198539	I'm not positive.
199059	200579	Actually, no, it's not based off Linux.
200719	201840	You can install Linux on it.
201860	203600	I'm sure someone's put Linux on it.
203700	207262	If they can install Linux on a freaking toaster oven, they can install Linux on that thing.
207282	208102	You can install Linux on it.
208202	209762	It actually is not based on Linux.
210543	216084	I thought it may have been because I know that GP2X, it's another homebrew device.
216985	217465	You can do that.
217625	219745	And it also outputs to TV, so that's kind of cool.
219925	220406	That's pretty cool.
220606	221926	Now, how much did one of those suckers cost you?
221946	221926	$80.
222826	223627	Wow, that's not bad.
223727	224307	And where'd you get it from?
224887	226288	and DarkSakura.com.
250749	251630	and you can put themes on it.
251710	253671	In fact, I have a Legend of Zelda theme on mine.
254572	258995	It's hard to see, Rob, but you'll have to take a look at it.
259375	260516	This is great radio, by the way.
262458	265860	It kind of has a crossbar thing going on like a PSP.
267281	267781	That's cool.
268642	269062	I like that.
269463	269883	It's pretty neat.
270188	272249	and Jamie is super gluing her fingers together apparently.
272269	273369	What the hell is she doing over there?
273389	274850	Is she doing arts and crafts during the show?
274890	276290	Like I know last week she was crocheting.
276570	277271	Now she's gluing.
277971	278751	She's trying to fix something.
278771	279391	Oh, and I forgot.
279411	283853	The other thing you can do, it has a built-in microphone so you can actually do dictation or whatever, record yourself.
284141	285402	That's kind of interesting.
285742	286062	All right.
286222	288224	Well, there you go.
288804	292646	Hey, guys, if you are listening to us live on this Saturday, you can join us in our chat room.
292706	295188	Chat dot Orange Lounge Radio dot com is the place to be.
295568	300872	Or if you're on the Game Surge Network on IRC, you just want to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
301452	301912	All one word.
302012	303133	And that is our chat room.
303433	305675	We do use a different room than the all games chatters.
306515	306915	I don't know why.
306975	307616	We just always have.
308136	309397	It's a history thing at this point.
309597	310658	Kind of tradition, I guess you could say.
311498	312059	How was your gaming week?
333757	337739	Alright, anyhow, now that we're taking care of business live on air, let's get into our gaming weeks.
337819	340981	And if DarkSakura's unglued her fingers, I'm going to ask her how her gaming week was.
341001	342221	I've got glue all over my fingers still.
342321	353407	I was fixing, my cell phone case broke, and the little thing that clips it to my belt snapped off, so I just super glued it back on.
354147	356248	Because rubber cement clearly isn't working.
356808	360150	And now I've just super glued my fingers, so I'm going to have to go run you some nail polish remover on them.
361994	362494	What about gaming?
362815	364396	I glued soap to my fingers.
365296	366517	She's too busy gluing her fingers together.
366537	368679	Apparently she's too busy gluing her fingers together to play games.
368959	373322	So I played some World of Warcraft yesterday for like an hour.
374223	375623	You've got to like level 10 now, huh?
376564	377885	I have a second character at 10 now.
378105	378646	I have a character at 15.
380027	380527	Moving on up.
380987	381968	My goat girl.
382449	383009	Fire, Frost, Arcane
407944	411465	I'm playing Dark Elf Druid.
412126	412466	Dark Elf?
412486	412806	What am I saying?
412826	413006	Blood Elf.
413026	414026	It's not fucking D&D.
414286	414627	Or Night Elf.
414647	415227	No, Night Elf.
415287	415847	Okay, gotcha.
415887	416927	I'm like, D&D!
416967	419148	It's okay, WoW ripped a lot off from D&D, so it works.
419248	421029	Now I'm gonna go pour acetone on my fingers.
421269	421929	Alright, have fun.
422409	424750	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week, besides the dingo?
425510	426251	Besides the dingo.
426531	430512	I actually played on my arcade cabinet a little bit, because I finally got... It's almost done.
430852	433313	The front end's working now.
434380	440746	The problem is I have too many games listed on there because I have every single game that's been pretty much ever put on MAME on that cabinet.
440946	442628	It makes it really hard to find stuff.
442728	447612	So I have to go back now and remove stuff off the list that I don't really want to play.
448093	449835	And that's going to be a process in itself.
450035	452357	So, yeah, fun.
452877	454079	But I did play a little bit of...
455031	455711	What did I play on there?
455731	457292	I was testing it out.
457792	459873	Oh, just some random Neo Geo games and stuff.
460214	460814	It works really well.
462055	464936	And then I've been playing Bayonetta.
465236	469939	I finally broke out my Japanese 360 and that game is all sorts of awesome.
471380	472461	I love it because it's...
489242	495126	It's not quality, it's quantity, and he starts throwing tons of pistols at her, and it's just absolutely ridiculous.
495246	496227	Wait, is it dubbed in English?
496647	497608	It's all in English.
497668	497928	Oh, nice.
497948	498869	The entire game is in English.
498889	507014	So you didn't play, I just played the demo, which was a selected stage from the game apparently, but you actually have the full Japanese one.
507034	508055	Yeah, I have the full game.
508115	509535	It's absolutely all in English.
511130	512792	and DarkSakura.com
536091	539072	I love the Joe Pesci type character.
539172	541173	It's Joe Pesci, but not Joe Pesci.
542694	544094	My favorite character in the game.
545895	548136	Just everything about the game is so over the top, though.
548276	552577	Seriously, it gives her new red pistols or whatever that are in the game.
553017	559540	And there's this sequence where the guy's mixing a drink and she's putting on the pistols in the most...
561540	562961	I hate Devil May Cry.
563201	563761	I hate it.
563801	565722	But this game is awesome.
566363	566703	It's just...
587976	590157	This is totally one of those games I never thought I would like.
590597	594118	Just kind of looking at screenshots where you don't really see the game in motion, you're kind of like, oh, yeah.
594158	595579	Okay, I have a proposal for you then.
596179	603282	Sometime in the next weeks or so, you should totally just bring it over and the three of us should just play through it.
603842	604382	That'd be fun.
604402	605162	Maybe tape it or something.
605182	606243	I have it in my car.
606463	606983	Do you really?
607043	608023	Yeah, I have it in my car.
608164	612865	In fact, I got to order pizza, or not pizza, but Pizza Hut pasta after the show.
612905	614846	And since we're going to be wrapped up, you know,
616024	618945	We have to be done before 5 Pacific because I think the next All Games program is at 5.
619405	624487	So since we're going to be done before then, what I thought, we might have a chance to play it for a few minutes.
625607	627608	Might be something we do after the show.
627668	629128	Too bad I don't have my video camera.
629148	630009	We'll figure something out.
630049	632669	I'm trying to think what else I played this week.
633009	637431	Still no Borderlands yet, but I'm hoping to break into that tomorrow night.
637831	640212	Unfortunately I got distracted by Bayonetta.
640612	643893	And then of course more Grand Theft Auto because that's what we play every day.
644113	644293	So
646427	674172	it's really sad though there's not a lot of people online playing Grand Theft Auto at least not the Ballad of Gay Tony multiplayer man there's like times where we'll be playing ranked matches where we can't get more than four people in and those four people are us it's so slow that we can get into the same ranked game easy now but I don't know talk to Dan at some point while he's off work I'm sure he'll play with you guys
675862	677463	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
697802	705005	Umlaut happened this Wednesday, and I actually trekked out over to the Bay Area to check it out, and it was cool.
705065	706566	It was a fun little event.
706886	710528	It wasn't super crowded, but it definitely wasn't a bad turnout.
710848	717891	It was tolerable, the amount of people in what is a much smaller club than you'd probably think if you're looking at some of those videos online of some of the bands.
718211	723213	Of course, the whole catch was that people would pay money to get up on stage and play rock band in a
723794	724695	and DarkSakura.com.
739062	739782	Great charity.
739862	742704	So it's kind of hard to say no to something like that.
742724	743624	In fact, I wanted to do it.
743644	747646	I just didn't have – with Jamie and Loki not being able to go, I just didn't have enough people to do the band.
747666	749526	I completely forgot about it until I saw the tweet on it.
749586	750947	Damn you.
751087	752568	That was today, wasn't it?
752708	753128	That's all right.
753368	754849	We still wouldn't have had enough people.
756189	756950	and DarkSakura.com.
772839	773980	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
800654	805978	I think it was his sister or niece and like her friends or something.
806899	807399	It was fun.
807880	809521	I think his niece used to do freestyle with him too.
809963	811444	Yeah, it was cool.
812305	823134	So, you know, they didn't have a lot set up as far as games because you just had the stage, which you had to pay to be on, or in the back, they had Beatles Rock Band, which actually had the new content.
823354	825035	But they had a lot of support from Harmonix.
825856	829239	And, you know, they had tons and tons of just loot.
829739	836905	Like, you know, you pay $10 to get in the door, which technically you don't have to do because it's a $10 suggested donation.
836965	838886	But since the whole thing's charity, if you don't pay $10...
839887	840788	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
867168	871850	And they had all sorts of just random shit on these loot tables.
872190	877252	Like PlayStation 1 games, Super Nintendo games I saw on there.
877532	879793	Like a calendar for Bayonetta I was looking at.
880073	882775	Like a lot of those promo type things you would see at E3.
883175	886396	Like the types of E3 swag all like dumped out on the table.
886716	887997	So I walked out of there with a...
888697	891879	Plug and Play Intellivision Part 2.
892960	893920	It's a little controller.
894301	898964	The second one they've released, apparently, with 10 Intellivision games, I guarantee you've never heard of.
899684	900985	Well, except Jamie, because she's crazy.
901265	901726	Yeah, I know.
902726	904908	But, you know, I walked out of there with that.
904948	910051	My friend, who I went with, Alan, he walked out of there with a copy of Advance Force 2 for Game Boy Advance.
910291	913413	So just all this, like, cool stuff on the loot table, it was kind of rad.
913834	916175	So, I mean, it was all donated to a great cause.
916395	918037	And then they had a silent auction going on.
918957	924162	which I know they gave away a very limited edition signed like
926953	930035	Space Invaders thing of which I think only 180 exist.
930475	933338	I think that thing went for like several thousand dollars.
934098	935820	They gave away like a stuffed thing from Lost Planet.
936580	938322	I won one of the silent auctions.
939002	946028	I don't want to talk about it on the show because part of it's going to be a Christmas present for someone and even though I don't think they listen I just don't want to talk about it on the show.
946608	951111	And if you figure it out please don't spread word out because it's somebody's Christmas present.
951972	954094	But I did win one of the auctions and you know what's funny?
955305	956045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
979476	981376	This guy named SHDragon left a comment.
981777	982697	Other fun things.
982937	987678	I lost the blank auction because the guy I was bid warring against was camping the clipboard.
988098	988418	Boo.
988758	989998	I can't believe that went for only $100.
990038	992919	Oh well, I didn't really have the money to spend anyway.
993399	994319	It's just kind of funny.
994419	996700	First off, I wasn't camping the clipboard.
996860	1001701	We just happened to be sitting in that back corner right by where the silent auction was, me and Alan and a couple guys.
1001941	1007422	But I did think, I will admit, yeah, I was going to go up there at $10.29 and make sure I was the highest bidder come $10.30, of course.
1007442	1007522	What?
1008442	1008482	A.B.
1008522	1008763	Tactics A.B.
1008803	1008963	Tactics
1018693	1046448	and it worked out and actually I got it for $90 not $100 so and it really it was a steal it was it was absolutely a steal and it should have gone for much more especially for such a good cause however $100 was about the most I was going to spend on this because I just you know even though it's for a good cause look I got to live too and got money and everything so you know that was probably about the most I was going to bid on it and I'm in turn giving half of it to somebody else so and I'll explain more about what that is after it gets given to the individual so
1048256	1049276	That was my experience at Umlaut.
1049316	1050097	Overall, very good.
1050437	1051718	I wish I could have stayed for more of it.
1051738	1052919	I wish I could have got up on stage.
1053559	1054240	But maybe next year.
1054260	1056722	I have heard it is confirmed again for next year.
1056882	1058423	I'm not sure if it's the same venue or what have you.
1058743	1061205	But honestly, if you guys haven't already...
1062806	1063607	I haven't played that yet.
1079363	1080083	Yeah, I downloaded it.
1080123	1088066	Sexy Bitch, or no, it's Sexy Chick, I think they renamed it, and When Love Takes Over, which is weird because that's download pack.
1088226	1089207	The songs aren't mixed.
1089567	1097070	It's just the one song, but they're like remixes of the song, I'm sure, that are available on a CD, remix CD somewhere, I'm sure, or vinyl.
1097590	1098350	But it was cool.
1098830	1101391	One of them has a crap ton of crossfading in it.
1101832	1103492	And I have to admit, I actually kind of like the songs.
1103832	1107814	So even though one of them had dudes from the Black Eyed Peas, which usually is one of those bands you're like, ugh.
1108294	1110615	They're so played out.
1110715	1115758	If I hear that goddamn song at the club one more time, I got a feeling.
1117079	1119761	Like, oh my god, if I hear that at the club one more time, I'm going to poke my eye out.
1120141	1121942	But I got to admit, that one song was pretty cool.
1121962	1123763	Do it on camera so we can put it on YouTube.
1123823	1124503	Yeah, fine.
1124924	1128306	All right, anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1128406	1129486	Again, we're pre-taping.
1129526	1135850	If you're just joining us on All Games Radio on Saturday, that's because we're pre-taping or pre-recording, whatever you want to call it,
1136110	1138632	We're doing a pre-thing for our Sunday, the 13th.
1138733	1140634	This will rebroadcast again on Sunday.
1140914	1148701	If you're listening live on Sunday, sorry we are not live, but we do hope you'll send us an email or a tweet or something to tell us what you thought about tonight's show.
1148742	1151604	And of course, the podcasters, well, you're used to getting this on the feed anyway.
1152985	1159091	Also, join our Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1159131	1162414	We always post little updates, especially if there is going to be weird things like
1163995	1166517	All right, gaming news.
1166777	1170720	Believe it or not, even though we're only a couple weeks out before Christmas, there's been quite a little bit of it.
1170780	1172001	So let's get into some gaming news.
1172441	1173742	Oh, oh, Loki.
1174503	1176664	Loki wants to do this during housekeeping tonight.
1176804	1177365	Real quick.
1177565	1177885	All right.
1177965	1183990	Loki has brought Christmas presents or Hanukkah presents, I suppose, if you will, at an appropriate time.
1184370	1190955	I had to bring him over because the cat was starting to eye him up because she likes ribbons and paper and stuff and she'll start ripping into it.
1191035	1195376	And don't I feel like a douchebag because, like, you know, Loki's brought this so early and I don't have his present here.
1195476	1197237	No, I don't do my shopping until Christmas Eve.
1197277	1197797	I really don't.
1197877	1199898	I did my shopping all this week pretty much.
1199938	1200178	All right.
1200438	1202679	I do my shopping afterwards so I get it all on sale.
1203059	1203239	All right.
1203259	1204539	Well, ladies first.
1204579	1205879	DarkSakura, you can open your gift.
1206160	1208600	So, DarkSakura, this is great radio.
1208700	1209381	They're wrapped in gold.
1209501	1210701	Surely the wife must have done this.
1211021	1211801	The wife was wrapped in gold.
1211861	1213422	I'm like, there's no way.
1213842	1216163	There's no way Loki did this wrapping himself.
1216183	1217223	I did no wrapping of that.
1217583	1225390	Going to our chat room at chat.orangelongeradio.com Toagak says, If you ever lose an episode of OLR, I'm archiving the live editions for you.
1225530	1226471	Oh, manga!
1227031	1227491	What'd you get?
1227932	1229513	Return to Labyrinth manga.
1229533	1230234	That's awesome.
1230514	1231535	Sweet!
1231635	1232916	Oh my god, that's super cool.
1232936	1234357	I'm gonna read the hell out of this.
1234437	1235038	That's great.
1235458	1239101	And dude, it's like... You gotta open the big one first.
1239121	1240783	I gotta open the big one first before the little one.
1240803	1241783	Okay, you got it.
1242104	1243545	So I'm gonna open the big one first.
1244726	1245667	This is a big...
1246775	1247596	Thank you for watching!
1269087	1270748	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1301052	1301712	Fuck yeah!
1301813	1303614	Guardian Legend, motherfucker!
1303634	1304674	There he goes.
1304915	1305375	Batteries.
1305495	1306215	Oh my god.
1306636	1307076	Awesome.
1307176	1308157	Okay, hold on.
1308677	1309337	This is great radio.
1309358	1310398	So, awesome.
1310418	1311059	Loki, you're the best.
1311079	1311559	Don't worry about it.
1311579	1313400	Take the Guardian Legends wherever you go.
1313420	1316162	Okay, so DarkSakura's gonna put these on the website or on the Twitter?
1316182	1317003	On the website.
1317043	1317523	On the website.
1317583	1318323	Okay, whoa.
1318444	1318984	Batteries fell.
1319004	1319584	Oh, the batteries.
1319604	1320125	But here you go.
1320625	1321606	Taking a picture live there.
1321626	1324788	There's my FC Mobile and copy of Guardian Legend.
1324808	1325348	Did you get that?
1325788	1325988	Yep.
1326129	1326549	Alright, cool.
1327489	1328530	I don't even know how I found those.
1328570	1332813	I don't even remember what I was looking for, but I somehow came across them.
1332873	1333554	Like, hey...
1351843	1355165	No, yeah, DarkSakura would... Oh my god, if I'd found those, I would have bought them for her too.
1355185	1356345	Remember what the movie's called?
1357085	1359747	It's, you know, Labyrinth guest star David Bowie's package.
1360587	1364749	And I'm sorry, this is prettier than David Bowie has ever been, and David Bowie is pretty.
1365458	1372680	Alright, well now that I'm in a super duper happy mood, part of me wants to turn this on during the break or something.
1372940	1374000	I want to get this up and going.
1374240	1375381	Dude, FC Mobile, yeah.
1375421	1377621	I'm going to go out and buy NES games like crazy.
1377921	1381982	Anyhow, now I can support portable gaming with this.
1382262	1382643	Do you really?
1383203	1384703	I can support portable games with this.
1385583	1387044	The hell with the DS and the PSP.
1387084	1388424	I got an FC Mobile, y'all.
1389024	1391045	Alright, getting into some gaming news tonight.
1391085	1391825	Loki, start us off.
1392957	1406389	So you may remember that a little bit ago, no doubt, and I believe Courtney Love tried suing Activision for the likenesses of Kurt Cobain and, of course, no doubt, in Band Hero more recently.
1408030	1414274	However, Activision has responded to No Doubt's claim by countersuing them.
1415214	1425920	Basically, their main response is that the band's request that their likenesses be limited to performing only the band's own songs in-game was made.
1426020	1430923	However, it was requested only after the band hero programming was finalized.
1431912	1436335	This is a gigantic bitch slap to one of the biggest bans in the last few years.
1436355	1436495	This...
1455232	1459156	You know, for me, I think it's just kind of retarded that Activision's doing it.
1459196	1465602	I mean, I understand that, you know, they had an agreement in place and apparently, you know, somebody didn't read the contract close enough or whatever.
1466223	1470487	And so, you know, they want their money back or they want, you know, the patch to this game.
1470527	1475311	But they can't, at least they can't on, you know, Wii and PlayStation 2 and that kind of stuff.
1475371	1476592	But, um...
1477293	1484776	And at the same time, now I'm wondering if this is going to prevent them from having other bands in the game going forward.
1484896	1485836	I have a theory about this.
1486176	1486457	Go ahead.
1486717	1497881	I think that the logic behind this would be, okay, well, we countersue you to where, you know, if we've got to make all this content change, then we want our money back, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1498421	1502523	I think it's actually going to end up in some kind of closed-doors deal.
1502543	1503183	Okay.
1503343	1506186	I'm sure it will, but they can't make the content change.
1506246	1510350	I mean, you can't just... And I've seen this going around on Twitter, is that why don't they just patch it in?
1510390	1511892	Well, you can't patch to the Wii.
1512212	1515535	They have no system of patching on the Wii, and you can't patch to the PS2.
1516116	1519159	So you would have games... The damage is done, period.
1519239	1520200	You can't go back and fix it.
1520320	1524845	And you would have people complaining, hey, you're removing content from the game, you know, what the hell...
1526645	1531569	Maybe I want, no doubt, to sing some stupid song because it's funny and I enjoy that.
1531749	1534712	And you're removing that ability for a game that I paid for.
1535192	1539636	To me, the countersuit just seems like a we fucking mean it kind of thing.
1539716	1541818	Like, you guys are wrong and we fucking mean it.
1542258	1544700	To me, this seems like they want to recoup their legal fees.
1544920	1545240	That's it.
1545320	1550385	I don't think they honestly would expect to win the whole thing, but I would think it's just legal fees.
1550745	1553387	That they see this as a quote-unquote frivolous lawsuit.
1553407	1564596	And I do see them winning this, actually, because the reason why is if they have them signed to a contract that agrees that their likenesses can be used in this fashion, there's not really much they can do.
1564676	1568078	They can bitch and moan about it, saying, well, I didn't realize it was going to be this.
1568659	1571001	Well, maybe you should have fucking read the contract closer then.
1571721	1573322	Same with the whole Kurt Cobain thing.
1573362	1581529	Yeah, it's tragic, but maybe you shouldn't have, I don't know, first off, licensed his likeness to be in the game, and maybe you should have read your contract.
1581874	1582935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1601150	1611575	I think I kind of said this then, and that is that when they showed this to Courtney Love or when they showed this to No Doubt, they probably didn't show them all this other stuff because of course they're not going to like that.
1611895	1616137	They wanted to show people having a good time, No Doubt singing No Doubt songs.
1616157	1620439	You're not going to win No Doubt over by showing them in the band playing Taylor Swift songs.
1620459	1623281	That's not going to be how you get them to sign on the dotted line.
1623581	1627983	And it's not like the band is going to take the time to sit down for four hours and play this game extensively.
1628263	1628724	Thanks for watching!
1646136	1651359	The only thing it's going to do is hurt their chances now to have these people in their games next time.
1651499	1652220	That's true.
1652780	1659804	But the thing is, though, the majority of the artists in the game, they're not the only ones that were in the game, aren't really bitching about it.
1659925	1662066	I don't think they really care.
1663121	1664683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1679801	1680622	Thanks for watching!
1703297	1704958	So does Courtney Love, believe it or not.
1705278	1708720	She got friends, and bands are going to think twice.
1708840	1717925	And maybe they'll think twice, and they'll also realize that, hey, this is what's going to happen if you get involved with Activision.
1719005	1722447	They'll see, based on this, if that's something they don't want, then they won't get involved.
1722887	1727570	Or they'll just, for the next one, they'll just lock it so that these characters can only sing their songs or something like that.
1728835	1746791	regardless of how this all goes down I would really like to see it settled on Judge Judy personally I would like to see Judge Judy settle this whole thing because I'll tell you what if you ever watch that show awesome and I'd like to just see her yell at the people from Activision don't talk when I'm not talking to you
1749389	1752792	Anyhow, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
1752832	1755535	Moving on to completely different news and quickly.
1756195	1758057	Mega Man 10 has been announced.
1758638	1761000	Mega Man 10, I think a lot of us kind of saw this coming.
1761080	1762902	Mega Man 9 was obviously very well received.
1763262	1764643	So Mega Man 10 is coming out.
1764964	1766885	Not to be confused with Mega Man X.
1767586	1768386	Thank you for watching!
1783411	1785994	Because Capcom likes to multi-platform their stuff.
1786294	1789438	But Nintendo Power is getting the first announcement on this.
1789838	1792281	Of course they're not going to tell you it's available on 360 and PS3.
1792541	1794923	Didn't it come out on WiiWare first before with 9?
1795584	1798127	Or was there a slight delay or something like that?
1798307	1801791	It's probably going to be on all the platforms.
1801811	1803452	It's probably like a week delay or something like that.
1803873	1804774	It'll be on all the platforms.
1805134	1805354	All right.
1806094	1807915	So Mega Man 10 has been announced.
1807975	1808395	It's coming out.
1808435	1811176	It's retrotastic again, the whole NES style.
1811556	1814577	And one of the new bosses has been announced, Sheep Man.
1815857	1816917	Yes, I'm not joking.
1817237	1817718	Sheep Man.
1817738	1821859	There's even some artwork out there that just looks kind of funny.
1825120	1831921	Anyhow, also there's supposed to be Proto Man as a playable character again, and there will be a third mystery character.
1832182	1833602	Dude, it better be Forte.
1834758	1836199	Dr. Wily is always the villain at the end of the day.
1836239	1842324	Did you notice in that little screenshot there that they have the dragon shooting guns out of its nipples, which is kind of...
1855274	1856755	Oh my god, that is a little strange.
1857175	1861216	Well, that's just the awkward artwork that Capcom has learned to embrace.
1861296	1863517	Their terrible, terrible box art for Mega Man 1 and 2.
1863617	1865298	There will be dragons with nipple guns.
1866078	1866598	I see it now.
1866638	1867358	Nipple Man!
1869939	1871400	It should be Nipple Woman.
1873720	1875261	Sadly, I don't see that happening.
1875301	1877722	I think this is supposed to be a friendly family game going on.
1878082	1881583	But Sheep Man, that's... If we have Sheep Man, we should have Cock Man.
1881703	1883364	What would be Sheep Man's weapon?
1883644	1883884	Like...
1885876	1886637	A woolly gun?
1886877	1890079	A sleep gun.
1891960	1893462	Allergies!
1893482	1894562	The allergy blaster.
1894802	1896584	Like he shoots at Mega Man and Mega Man gets a rash.
1897324	1905250	Also supposed to be in the game in easy mode, which for those folks that were struggling a little bit in Mega Man 9, I'm sure in easy mode will be welcomed for the game.
1906271	1907452	Including me, I'm sorry.
1907492	1911855	Mega Man 9, I think I got past like three bosses and that's as far as I could get, so yeah.
1912964	1914626	DarkSakura, what do you got for us tonight?
1927358	1931680	Well, it's a particular, actually, it's a bit of fine culture, Rob.
1932000	1932761	A bit of fine culture.
1933341	1934781	It's a stage production, actually.
1935282	1935962	Oh, awesome.
1936202	1936822	So culture.
1937102	1937323	Yes.
1937363	1938483	Going up and singing.
1938603	1943806	Is it like the fabulous news I found out last night that Sister Act, the movie, is being adapted for Broadway next year?
1943826	1944886	I thought it had already been done.
1945066	1945786	It had been done.
1945846	1946287	It's in London.
1946307	1946707	They did Xanadu.
1946847	1947727	It's in London right now.
1948048	1949448	And it's going to be on Broadway next year.
1949468	1950269	They did Xanadu.
1950949	1951289	I know.
1951509	1952149	Xanadu.
1952169	1953670	It did pretty well, actually.
1953690	1955391	I think it finally closed, but it did very well.
1955919	1961223	Well, this is about another fine stage production, but actually it's being done in Sweden.
1962924	1965146	It's a Silent Hill stage production.
1965166	1966307	Okay.
1966807	1982138	So, I mean, imagine you step out onto the, you know, the curtain pulls back and you see a man wandering around wearing a car suit, swerving off the road, and then getting out of the car suit to go chase a
1983529	1985530	A 30-year-old dressed as a 5-year-old girl.
1985630	1988212	And the production takes like 50 fog machines.
1988693	1989834	Yeah, 50 fog machines.
1991175	1994257	But they're going to be posting the whole play on YouTube.
1995538	1995798	Nice.
1995878	1997980	So keep an eye out for that.
1999081	2000122	It's done by a bunch of fans.
2000562	2004405	I would say that this play would get shut down immediately for copyright infringement issues.
2004425	2005186	Oh, it's based on Silent Hill 2.
2005802	2029976	but seeing as this is in another country I don't know if that's as easy to do plus I mean I don't know if I were Konami I'd be kind of flattered like I wouldn't want to shut it down I think if I were Konami I'd be like oh shit how are they gonna pull this off one of my friends on LiveJournal they did like a Star Wars play they did a play out of Star Wars the movie and I think they were afraid they were gonna get shut down but it turned out like Lucas embraced it and it was ended up being like officially endorsed by them
2030430	2031871	Josh Whedon is my lord and master now.
2058038	2060699	Anyhow, Silent Hill the play, yes or no?
2060879	2064820	I would love to watch it, except the whole thing's going to be in Swedish, which you know what this means.
2065661	2068802	We need Ake Ripper to go out and observe the play for us.
2068822	2071603	Ake Ripper, you are now our theater reviewer?
2072728	2075169	Congratulations, you've just been promoted to OLR.
2075189	2078549	He's not even listening right now, I'm sure, because we're on at a completely different time.
2078589	2084230	But, you know, if you're listening on Sunday, Aki Ripper, you are now our official Broadway correspondent.
2084871	2086191	This counts for Swedish Broadway.
2086291	2086511	Rob.
2086791	2086951	What?
2087111	2089432	MXT, by the way, going back to the Mega Man story.
2089752	2090892	Oh, yeah.
2090952	2094753	So Sheet Man's weapon, according to Wikipedia, is thunder wool.
2095373	2096193	Thank you, chatters.
2096253	2097533	Chat.orangelandry.com.
2097613	2098013	Thunder wool.
2098033	2098714	Thunder wool.
2099174	2100374	Was it just using static?
2100394	2100614	Yeah.
2101910	2104893	Do you just rub the wool against your body a whole lot and generate the static?
2104933	2105894	Aki Ripper is in chat.
2106374	2106554	Is he?
2106714	2106854	Oh!
2106974	2109096	You are now our theater correspondent.
2109156	2109977	Oh, Aki Ripper's here.
2110057	2111218	Congratulations, Aki Ripper.
2111258	2111938	You've been promoted.
2111979	2113200	Now go see the Silent Hill play.
2114400	2115181	Thunderwool.
2115481	2117963	It's probably playing on the complete other side of Sweden.
2118023	2120666	It's like hours and hours away from where Aki Ripper's at.
2120686	2122327	Well, how long does it take to get across Sweden?
2122847	2123328	I don't know.
2125149	2126951	By foot or by car or by plane?
2127011	2128592	It depends, I guess, which direction you're going to.
2128692	2129293	I'm going to be the...
2130197	2133719	The ignorant Americans say, Sweden's not that big, come on.
2133959	2136741	Well, keep in mind... I think it's about the size of California.
2136761	2138262	I don't think it's much bigger than California.
2138822	2142805	Keep in mind, our states are technically little small countries.
2143465	2146607	We just happen to be under one big federation.
2147087	2151250	Sort of like, I guess, the European Union without having to... Or like Star Trek.
2152530	2153071	Yes, Rob.
2153991	2158554	Someone linked me to a Star Trek menorah, by the way, that someone made out of action figures and LED lights.
2159451	2159791	Beautiful.
2160031	2160191	Yeah.
2160471	2161512	All right.
2161612	2164512	Aki Ripper says it's 14 hours away from where he is.
2164632	2165553	That's not that far.
2165573	2166113	That's not that far.
2166133	2166553	Get on a plane.
2166573	2167373	We'll send you gas money.
2167733	2168233	Get on a plane.
2168794	2169114	All right.
2171074	2172375	Loki, what do you have for us?
2172955	2173195	Okay.
2173335	2173715	Well, wait.
2173735	2175255	Before you get there, then fine.
2175315	2185398	If Aki Ripper is going to boo-hoo about 14 hours away, even though he's closer than any of the rest of us, then we need a Swede who's listening to the show who can go, who lives next door to this.
2185458	2187679	Maybe that was answering if it was...
2188559	2191381	You know, 14 hours to get from one end of the country to the other.
2191662	2191782	Oh.
2193323	2193623	Maybe.
2194144	2194684	I don't know.
2194704	2195525	I don't know.
2195545	2195905	I give up.
2195985	2196846	Or by sheep.
2196866	2198827	We'll just wait for the damn thing to get on YouTube.
2198847	2200349	DarkTetsuya said, no, by sheep.
2201690	2203691	By ThunderWool Airlines.
2203771	2204652	ThunderWool.
2204932	2206033	ThunderWool.
2206574	2208855	That sounds like... This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
2209216	2210697	Live at the Monster Truck Rally.
2210817	2214220	See the big trucks take on ThunderWool.
2216081	2216942	Under 18, not admitted.
2217082	2217983	Without parental consent.
2219991	2221353	Candy Cane Jojo's
2233670	2236151	You thought we forgot Orange Lounge Foodio tonight, ladies and gentlemen.
2236971	2242453	So, remember that story that we talked about the PSP minis being playable on the PS3?
2242533	2243514	How was the rumor and everything?
2243754	2249516	Well, this week, update 3.15 came out, allowing you to play PSP minis on your PS3.
2250456	2251456	So hooray!
2251476	2260139	If you were very envious of your PSP minis and you possibly didn't own a PSP, well now you can play them on your PS3.
2260880	2269843	And the best part about that is too, that one purchase of the PSP mini obviously will allow you to play it both on the PS3 and on the PSP.
2271343	2279246	And you'll also be able to connect the two systems via LAN to transfer data from one system to the next.
2280131	2282273	Not all the games will work right away.
2301530	2302350	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2330043	2331403	Well, here's what I want to know.
2332184	2341306	If you're able to play these PSP minis on your PS3, is that going to lead way to playing PSP games on your PS3?
2342586	2344266	And then we won't need the PSP anymore?
2344346	2346867	You can just buy your game and play the systems?
2346987	2348307	I would like that.
2348447	2350488	I don't know if that's something they would do.
2353035	2353956	I don't know.
2353976	2354036	But...
2379520	2380140	It'd be a good idea.
2380601	2383563	It's the next step to getting to the PlayStation 2 on the PS3.
2384424	2385064	I don't know, chatters.
2385084	2385564	What do you think?
2386085	2393290	Chat.OrangeLinesRadio.com Do you think that having PSP games playable on the PS3 is a good idea for Sony?
2393590	2394711	If it was technically possible.
2395051	2396573	Let's assume that it's technically possible.
2397475	2398896	I don't know.
2399376	2406139	Do you remember the early, early rumors of the PlayStation 3 and some of the trademarks actually showed a UMD drive on the PS3?
2406499	2406999	Do you remember that?
2407800	2411741	I remember that vaguely, years and years ago, before this thing came out.
2412302	2415723	Some of the early trademarks, I think we reported on this show, had a UMD drive in it.
2416623	2418784	So maybe this is something they were thinking of at one time.
2420165	2420425	Maybe.
2421866	2422286	Maybe neat.
2423615	2430040	All right, well, one game that isn't on the PSP, well, it is on the PSP, but the PS3 game is amazing, is LittleBigPlanet.
2430521	2439228	And, you know, this game has kind of gotten coverage a lot in the past few weeks on our show, which is amazing for a game that's been out a year, again, continuing to be supported.
2439748	2448936	And one way that is continuing is through an alliance with Disney for Pirates of the Caribbean content to be added to LittleBigPlanet.
2448956	2451378	That's right, you'll soon get to play Captain Sack.
2452455	2453516	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2464162	2467585	Water is going to be the next big thing they add in LittleBigPlanet.
2467805	2471709	Because, you know, the last big mechanic they added was a year ago in the Metal Gear Solid content.
2471729	2475212	They added the gun, the paint gun, and that changed the way you build levels.
2475512	2476794	Well, now they're going to have water.
2476854	2478335	The Sackboys can swim in water.
2478715	2482058	That's going to be huge for developmental levels, and whole new ideas will be there.
2483379	2489325	But, of course, this is a great tie-in to have water-based content, because, obviously, Pirates of the Caribbean, they sail on water.
2489765	2489885	So...
2490786	2492107	This is all supposed to come out, by the way.
2492147	2498089	The rumor is all of this is hitting before Christmas, which would mean probably next week, if this is true.
2498409	2502431	Keep in mind, LittleBigPlanet has not had any major expansion like this.
2502471	2509014	I mean, granted, they've kept the game fresh with the levels, the costumes, and some of those things, the stickers and somewhat.
2509214	2514316	But this is the first major game-changing thing they've done since the Metal Gear Solid.
2515726	2523224	I think it's awesome I will probably buy it And I haven't played LittleBigPlanet in quite some time So this is something that I guess you could say could get me back I don't know
2524883	2532868	Hey, going into our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Some of the comments from my earlier question about Do you think PSP games should be on the PS3?
2534109	2545696	Toagak says, only if they give us our fucking UMD drive back Well, technically they never took it away The PSP 3000 is still being made, still being sold, yes And much better than the PSP Go
2546218	2547779	Alpha Cananagram says, sure, why not?
2547839	2551460	PS1 games are allowed on PS3 and they look shitty, so why not PSP games?
2551800	2552421	Well, now, hold on.
2552461	2554862	The PS1 games only look shitty because you're spoiled.
2555502	2559083	And those games were made for a different time when we didn't have HD TVs.
2559584	2562525	Even though I'm only talking like 10 years ago, technology was different back then.
2562765	2563605	We're all spoiled now.
2563825	2565306	They look shitty because we have better TVs.
2566018	2567498	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2585183	2587587	may be coming soon due to a leak in update trophies
2597984	2606132	And one other thing from chat, TigerClaw says, who knows, perhaps Sony is secretly working on a PSP 4000, which would probably be a hybrid of the Go or something.
2606873	2608214	You never know what Sony might be doing.
2608715	2610597	I don't know so much about another PSP revision.
2611017	2613359	I think, honestly, the next thing we're going to get is like a PSP 2.
2614460	2616422	But I've been wrong before.
2616603	2616963	Who knows?
2617984	2619505	Anyhow, DarkSakura, what's up next for us?
2620266	2620647	Stuff.
2621407	2621948	And such.
2622495	2628360	Yeah, there's actually been an announcement by SNK for some Xbox Live Arcade games.
2628821	2636068	We actually have Metal Slug 7 isn't coming out.
2636908	2647338	But Metal Slug XX or maybe XX is the PSP remixed version of the DS one is going to be coming out in 2010 instead.
2648739	2657444	and as far as Xbox Live Arcade fighting games, there's going to be King of Fighters 2002 Ultimate Match and Neo Geo Battle Coliseum.
2657784	2660725	There also will be the King of Fighters Sky Stage.
2661025	2661966	That looks stupid.
2662486	2665247	It looks incredibly stupid, but I think I want to play it just for lols.
2667889	2669189	So hey, more Metal Slug for me.
2671010	2672251	And that's never quite a bad thing?
2672331	2677434	Or more Flying Iori shooting things in the sky with his big Orochi self.
2677674	2678014	And how.
2678854	2680636	Twin Sector on PC
2696969	2700391	I remember Reader Rabbit on the Apple IIe.
2700431	2700711	Yeah.
2700731	2700811	Wow.
2712397	2712678	All right.
2739983	2767523	and then also more stuff for little kids Playmobil Pirates and Playmobil Circus Pirates for the DS and Circus for the Wii and that's it that still sounds like a lot considering where we're at that's sad there's actually some better stuff well next week's even lighter but it's really like two games but they're decent games well I wish excuse me I wish I could say it's a slow week in Japan but it's really not it's actually still a pretty big week over there
2768496	2768816	Gundam Musou 2
2785436	2786217	I believe so.
2786297	2787877	It looks very much like it.
2787937	2789798	The whole combo meter in the corner and everything.
2789818	2790899	Probably the re-release of it.
2791239	2793140	Yeah, and the graphics are very, very pretty.
2794061	2798223	But, of course, this week is epic week in Japan and actually for a lot of people here in the U.S.
2798283	2798463	too.
2798803	2800144	I know a lot of people are going to be importing.
2800304	2800564	Not me.
2800604	2803325	Final Fantasy XIII does come out on the PlayStation 3.
2803926	2813411	Seeing as the PlayStation 3 is region free, if you want to pay $100, yes, that's right, that's what some importers are charging for this, $100, you can import this game.
2813988	2815708	Death Connection Not the Love Connection
2849759	2853682	Amelia was entrusted to the priest when she was a baby.
2854002	2856924	Growing up in the small town church, the girl became a gentle beauty.
2857284	2861327	Along with the priest and Joshua, a boy she sees as a brother, she lived a peaceful life.
2861707	2866731	However, everything changed the night mafia members charged into the church seeking to end Amelia's life.
2869221	2870181	So it's got everything.
2870241	2874402	It's got the mafia, church, religion things.
2874862	2877343	It's all in the Death Connection coming out on the PlayStation 2.
2878863	2887285	And on the Nintendo DS, Dear Girl Stories, Hibiki, Tokokun Daisakusen comes out in regular and limited edition.
2887705	2890726	Deka Sports DS also making its way to the Nintendo DS.
2890906	2895587	And Loki, I know, has already probably pre-ordered Jewel Pet 2 comes out on the DS.
2896207	2898828	As well as a game I first read as PP Girl.
2899008	2899248	P-O-U-P-E-E
2924475	2928117	and a total of 8 people can play Poopy Girl all at once.
2928197	2929919	Isn't it like Poupée or something?
2930299	2931179	Like French or something?
2931339	2932380	The chatroom is yelling at me.
2932400	2934702	It's like Po-Pay, just the way it's pronounced.
2935062	2940365	But I'm sorry, when I read it in my honky American way, P-O-U-P-E-E, Poopy Girl.
2945508	2949131	To which all the Japanese purists are screaming at me in chatroom.
2951556	2954138	on the PSP Dice Dice Fantasia.
2955138	2956139	Dice Dice Baby.
2956359	2957199	Do you even care?
2957660	2960281	Do you even care when Poopy Girl's out this week?
2961542	2962402	That, no.
2964644	2966285	Anyhow, moving on.
2966325	2968266	DarkSakura, what's coming out in the UK?
2968726	2969727	Well, not a busy week.
2971636	2976779	We have, for our buddies overseas, we have on the 15th, EverQuest Underfoot.
2978000	2980262	Does anyone still play EverQuest?
2980322	2982783	A lot of people, they wouldn't be doing these expansions.
2982964	2983424	I guess.
2984364	2987046	On the 16th, we have Alien Breed Evolution.
2987867	2991689	17th, we have Blue Toad Murder Files, whatever the fuck that is.
2995091	2997653	On the 18th, we have Buzz Quiz World.
2998414	3000335	And 19th, we have Nicky Rock and Ball.
3002244	3002524	That's it.
3003585	3006466	I'm laughing over here from this comment in chat about Poopie Girl.
3006866	3007867	Sorry, Po-Pay Girl.
3008227	3013290	Salacious Pop says, She spends the entire game walking funny and looking upset.
3014270	3015271	That is excellent.
3019813	3023155	Alpha Cananigram says, Sky, y'all are trying to kill me by making me laugh to death.
3023215	3024596	Well, we try to be funny once in a while.
3025556	3025856	All right.
3025916	3028498	Anyhow, moving on to some more news.
3028838	3030659	Our classic game of the week just a few minutes away.
3032779	3032999	Yes.
3034921	3048371	So, apparently, I didn't even realize there was a whole lawsuit against Divino, but there was, apparently, by Nintendo, trying to prevent the company from selling DS flashcards.
3049312	3059700	Apparently, they won, I believe, their injunction in Hong Kong, but in France, and why they're trying to...
3061221	3062102	Winning in France as well.
3062822	3065083	Apparently, they lost.
3065943	3069045	Actually, Divino won that suit.
3069585	3073547	And now, of course, Nintendo is appealing the ruling.
3074228	3080331	And finally, I guess another lawsuit against them to try to prevent them from selling DS flashcards.
3080371	3088875	Because it enables people to... Apparently, they call it a game copying device.
3090424	3092323	Honestly though, that's a little...
3094457	3094857	I don't know.
3095398	3099480	The device doesn't allow you to copy games, but it allows you to play copied games, I guess.
3099681	3100021	Okay, wait.
3100041	3106305	Somebody's got to break this down for me, because I seem to remember talking about this when the whole appeal was won in Hong Kong.
3106645	3107966	So now they're going to France.
3108246	3110087	Is there a production of this going on there, too?
3110107	3111128	They didn't win in Hong Kong.
3111148	3112529	They actually lost in Hong Kong.
3112909	3117372	It shows you how much I was paying attention that night.
3117532	3124177	Yeah, Nintendo made a statement that Divino still owes the company damages from a ruling made in Nintendo's favor in Hong Kong last year.
3125078	3125659	And it says... So...
3139870	3140631	Don't you own this device?
3162117	3162737	The R4?
3162757	3164357	I own two in my life.
3164377	3166638	I have a Ninja Pass, too.
3166658	3167418	I have an R4.
3168058	3170259	Okay, have you ever used the R4 to pirate a game?
3170699	3171399	To pirate a game?
3171579	3171739	No.
3171819	3173439	I've used it to play pirated games, yes.
3175720	3176360	Tricky, tricky.
3176420	3177240	I see what you did there.
3177320	3177600	Okay.
3179760	3179980	Fine.
3180360	3185301	And I can't order from Divino because my bank doesn't like me ordering from countries across the sea.
3185761	3187762	Malaysia, I think, is where they're out of.
3188762	3188922	Yeah.
3190137	3191979	Alright, well, I don't know.
3191999	3198187	I mean, I think if it's being used for bad things, Nintendo has a right to some extent, but at the same time...
3199619	3206121	There are legitimate purposes for these, I suppose, and you can't go after the people that are doing this for legitimate reasons.
3206141	3211163	You have to go after the people that are dumping the games and putting them on the web.
3211183	3213364	That's who they need to go after is the people dumping the games.
3213444	3226669	It's just like with BitTorrent and stuff like that, a lot of times they're going after the release groups that are dumping the titles because the downloading of the titles isn't really...
3228255	3230298	They're not really stealing anything.
3230318	3230698	I don't know.
3230799	3234363	It's kind of tough with digital media and stuff because you're not technically stealing something.
3234403	3235665	You're just making a copy of it.
3237501	3243823	And they're kind of going after more like real piracy, like people actually making bootlegs and selling them on the street type stuff.
3245043	3247944	Well, moving on to one more story before we get to the classic game of the week tonight.
3248564	3252185	We were actually linked to this story on our Twitter and it was suggested that we talk about this.
3252425	3258786	And Kotaku ran a feature this week about who they're calling – well, it says – I guess the name of the story is Achievement Chore.
3259146	3261347	She plays for Gamerscore whether it's fun or not.
3261587	3262948	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3281764	3282424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3301431	3302853	Toshiba, anyway, nobody cares.
3303193	3305516	But anyhow, they ran this little story on her.
3305596	3308459	She's a 24-year-old stay-at-home mom in northwest Indiana.
3308759	3313925	She got started on this whole thing when I guess it became like a friendly race between her and her friend about gamerscore.
3314425	3317388	And it was a race to see who could get 20,000 first.
3317428	3318970	And now I guess it's just become an obsession.
3319331	3320392	The girl has, I guess...
3322133	3339105	a Japanese Xbox 360 and a regular Xbox 360 she has mad respect in the community for I guess being nice she says quote once I found sites that had guides on which were the easy games I beat 20,000 in like a month and a half it got me hooked and it was like a drug a bad drug a bad habit
3339665	3340686	So it's kind of interesting.
3340726	3343307	I mean, we joke a lot about achievement whores here on the show.
3343347	3345409	And I know we've called Loki an achievement whore many times.
3345789	3347410	But it's kind of like... I just don't care anymore.
3347450	3348651	Well, now you stop caring.
3348671	3350152	And I did too to some extent.
3350192	3352953	But it's kind of interesting to see what makes them tick.
3353654	3354574	And I thought this story was...
3355885	3358226	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3383979	3386560	And she does have a six-year-old girl that she's raising, too.
3387040	3388460	So, there you go.
3388540	3390281	Rob, I'm playing with poopies.
3391321	3392401	Did you go onto the website?
3392481	3393201	Yes, I did.
3393701	3396322	Was Tiger Claw linked us to the... I love these things.
3396342	3397442	...Pope Girl website?
3397902	3399343	Or is it renamed Poopy Girl?
3399743	3403604	I've been playing... Well, keep in mind, I used to play with the candy bar doll maker thing.
3403964	3405384	So, this is actually... And I've got my big dolls.
3405524	3406624	So, this is actually kind of fun for me.
3407164	3410845	Even though, like, you know... So, you like Poopy Girls?
3413326	3413466	Um...
3413954	3414735	Thank you for watching!
3428300	3428700	Why is that?
3428940	3433003	It's the top ten reasons, you know, to play Sims, according to them.
3433283	3436605	They're all, your friends can throw a rockin' party, and then burn the house down.
3436745	3445270	And so they show that, and then there's like another one, it's like, you know, these two women, oh, because learning a new language is sexy, is number nine.
3445290	3447712	They have like the teacher wearing just lingerie and stuff.
3448292	3451794	So it's like all the really wrong things people do with the Sims.
3451814	3456117	Your sister can flirt with death, which is awesome, instead of your boyfriend.
3457117	3479698	or her boyfriend I guess um and then they also had like uh your kids can finally learn to get along and they show the girl like laughing maniacally and her brother's on fire and it's awesome your grandma can still spy on the neighbors and not get arrested and they have like her peeping on like some naked guy which is kind of funny um
3481055	3483537	Your brother and sister, oh, your brother can finally get lucky.
3483797	3486598	And they have, like, some chick staring him down.
3489320	3490201	Killing your boss.
3490321	3492582	And then they have, like, what are some of the other ones?
3494043	3494943	Experimenting.
3494963	3495904	They have, like, two chicks.
3496064	3497105	One dressed up like a cheerleader.
3497165	3501347	One dressed up like, oh, God, I don't remember what else the other one was.
3502488	3503108	Making out.
3503469	3507231	It's just all sex, violence, all the stuff he got.
3507251	3508712	All the great things about The Sims.
3509799	3510259	DarkSakura.com
3539167	3541673	and pick a game from yesteryear that she says, you know what?
3542455	3544860	You bitches should be checking this game out.
3546825	3547245	Yeah.
3547266	3547346	Yeah.
3548283	3552145	and I closed the link to whatever she sent me earlier for the game, but that's alright.
3552165	3554105	If you don't have it again, that's okay, I'll find it.
3554125	3555746	No, I can get it.
3557847	3559728	Well, the game is Einhander.
3559888	3560928	Yay, Einhander!
3561408	3563689	Which is a pretty cool shooting game.
3564870	3566890	It's pretty rare.
3567371	3570752	You know, not as in it was made by Rare, but it's pretty rare of a game.
3571712	3575193	Anyway, it's a side-scrolling shooter.
3575473	3580514	It was done by Square, and it came out on PlayStation in 1997.
3580594	3584635	It did get a re-release for PSN on June 25th.
3585775	3593636	It means single-handed, because the ship that you use has a single manipulator arm.
3594717	3595837	That was the one that I thought sucked.
3596764	3597845	Sorry, it's just the first one I found.
3597865	3599446	There's one on there for like stage 7 or stage 5.
3599627	3600247	Okay, I'll find it.
3600387	3602529	I'll try and help Rob find the right thing.
3602929	3606493	But yeah, it's about a war between the Earth and the Moon.
3606593	3611777	It has a really cool soundtrack done by Fukui Kenichiro.
3612077	3621105	So yeah, you play through the game, and it's sort of a 2.5D, so it's got shifting camera angles, and everything in the game is 3D, but you mostly play...
3622927	3624188	in a two-dimensional method.
3624488	3625389	You've got different multiples.
3626690	3629252	You've got different difficulty settings, multiples of those.
3630553	3634956	You do have a free mode that gives you unlimited continues, but you cannot have a score.
3636578	3640340	You can get different speeds, and you have...
3641550	3651874	You start off with a machine gun and you can collect gun pods that will give you different enemy missions or cannons or guided missile launchers or even a lightsaber type of thing.
3654435	3659117	There's also... You have to throw away your gun pods when you run out of ammo.
3659697	3661198	So there's that.
3663217	3683523	Also, you have a multiplier bar and a hit gauge counter, so as you destroy the cores of the enemies, your hit counter increases, and you get multiplied points by that, but when you stop shooting things, your counter decreases.
3683963	3685944	So basically, this is helping you for your score.
3688075	3689435	It's a pretty neat game.
3690056	3692317	It's actually the first 3D shooter that Square did.
3697680	3705564	They actually said that Square used some of what they learned from making Final Fantasy VII into Einhander.
3708482	3719027	And, uh... It actually... One cool thing about it is that, um... There was another game that came out in Japan that was, um... Chocobo no Fushigi na Dungeon, which is, you know, Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon.
3719827	3726110	And it had a bonus Mystery Data Disk, which actually was memory card data for a lot of games, including Einhander.
3726870	3729471	Um... Working Designs wanted to bring it out.
3730732	3735434	Um... But, um... Square just actually did it anyway.
3735714	3735854	So...
3736434	3738737	Really cool game, really cool, really fun game.
3738797	3743082	And you have to understand, really fucking hot for this era on the PlayStation 1.
3743542	3745064	The graphics were just outstanding.
3745505	3748308	Oh yeah, and it's a pretty difficult game too.
3749449	3755776	Yeah, I'd have to say that the play in it is really tight.
3757074	3761476	And also, the music that goes with the stages, I always thought was spot on.
3765397	3770579	The only thing that actually has a problem with it, I think, is that you can't play two-player.
3771680	3773040	Oh, that's a bummer.
3773360	3775281	So you can't be, I guess, Zweihander.
3776501	3778562	If they did a sequel, I think they should do Zweihander.
3779703	3781243	And, like, have two different gun arms.
3782584	3783124	It's possible.
3784665	3785025	That's it.
3785265	3785605	Einhander.
3786522	3793927	Alright, there you go kids, your classic game of the week this week is Einhander, available on the PlayStation numero uno.
3794627	3804773	Alright, that's going to do it for part A tonight, we're going to take a quick break though, we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, our little special Saturday edition that we'll also play again on Sunday, and also play again on the podcast.
3805174	3806955	So stay tuned, we'll be right back with plenty more.
3813322	3819525	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Saturday afternoon, December the 12th of 2009.
3819565	3819945	That's right.
3820285	3823667	We are taping a little bit early for tomorrow night's show.
3823707	3826649	So you'll hear this again on Sunday, December 13th, of course, at our usual time.
3827049	3831331	And then, of course, on our podcast feed available at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3831651	3836534	Now, during the break there, I had to get my new toy all out of the box and unpacked.
3836814	3837294	Check this out.
3844605	3845906	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3874758	3882662	Yes, there is a game that's out there on Microsoft's community game service that will help you talk to girls.
3883723	3884183	That's right.
3884403	3885464	In case you don't know how.
3885824	3902613	It's an indie game called Don't Be Nervous Talking to Girls, and it allows you to, I guess, practice by talking to a picture of a woman with some interactive dialogue that allows you to choose from a few different...
3904864	3905565	Thanks for watching!
3924920	3928802	I would like to see DarkSakura play this game on how to talk to girls and see how it goes.
3928962	3929843	I am a girl!
3930643	3932924	And I like being told I am from outer space.
3933505	3934365	It's only a dollar.
3934545	3936286	A whole dollar?
3936306	3937147	A whole dollar.
3937847	3940609	I may pick this up just for shits and giggles.
3940729	3944771	Leo Shen in our chatroom, chat.orangelandre.com says, will they have a choice to put it in?
3947852	3948453	Stick it in!
3950056	3950456	Ah, yes.
3951397	3952077	Maybe in the sequel.
3952317	3953157	Maybe in the sequel.
3954678	3958680	Well, Yakuza 3 is making its way over to the U.S.
3958940	3959360	as well.
3959620	3969744	It's going to be heading over here March 2010, and will feature the wonderful gameplay that the Japanese have already been able to check out for a while now.
3970444	3974326	It's also actually coming to Europe and Australia around that same time frame as well, so that's kind of cool.
3975964	3981389	Also, 505 Games announced a brand new series that they're going to be putting out called Naughty Bear.
3982191	3986935	And I have to admit, their bear rendering ability is quite amazing.
3987075	3988597	You've been a very naughty bear.
3989357	3992620	Of course, in gay culture, naughty bear means a whole other thing.
3993601	3995583	Yeah, yeah.
3995783	4000307	Apparently, the game is actually a violent action game starring an animated stuffed bear.
4000948	4006552	Specifically, a stuffed bear who swears revenge on other jerk bears for failing to invite him to a party.
4007333	4016837	and so your goal is to scare and irritate and of course hurt other bears racking up naughty points as you do using weapons during about the game's 30 stages.
4016877	4019818	Wait, so you play a bear encouraged to rape other bears?
4020338	4021519	Well, they never said rape.
4021639	4022639	They said hurt.
4022879	4023640	In the face.
4025740	4026341	That's kind of cool.
4027661	4029262	They're calling it Manhunt for Teddy Bears.
4030942	4031982	That's really what it is.
4032002	4032863	This is about violence.
4032983	4033903	This is just teddy bears.
4033923	4034383	It's okay.
4035564	4037764	You can tear Teddy Ruxpin limb from limb.
4037804	4038264	It doesn't matter.
4038304	4038844	He's just a bear.
4038884	4040405	It's coming from the developer, actually.
4041125	4042986	It's the same developer that put out Wet.
4044646	4048767	Looking in our chatroom, of course, they are still hung up on the talking to girl game.
4049247	4052668	TigerClaw says they probably have a version for the girls on how to talk to guys.
4053169	4054009	I don't think they need one.
4054069	4055309	It's just with your tits.
4055529	4057010	That's basically how they do it.
4057050	4057650	Right, DarkSakura?
4060342	4062763	It's just two buttons, giggle, flash, tits.
4064604	4066245	It's just two buttons, giggle and tits.
4067385	4072047	Bauer CTU in our chatroom says, are one of the choices, are you poopy girl?
4073648	4073868	Lol.
4074861	4075421	See, I like that.
4075461	4077882	Taking it back to a previous topic in the show.
4078282	4078682	Good job.
4079322	4081282	Anyhow, going on to some other stories.
4081362	4082603	Brutal Legend, of course.
4083203	4084563	How has Brutal Legend sales been?
4084743	4085763	They've been like okay, right?
4085783	4087024	They've been alright.
4087284	4089404	Well, hopefully this will invigorate sales a little bit.
4089464	4094485	A new download content piece called The Hammer of Infinite Fate is coming out this week on December 17th.
4095525	4102387	It is a chance for you getting to, I guess, carve a giant disembodied head into Mount Rockmore.
4103127	4106069	of Tim Schafer, the developer of Brutal Legend.
4106289	4107469	I guess that's what you get.
4107549	4107850	I don't know.
4108610	4118575	You also get an upgrade that shows every collectible that's on the map and some new outfits for Eddie and what's probably a highlight for a lot of people, four new multiplayer maps.
4118635	4127800	It's going to cost you $4.99 on PS3, yet $6 on the Xbox 360, but that might be an error because usually those things are the same.
4128520	4132964	Hey, if you still haven't picked up DJ Hero, a place you could probably grab it is the Guitar Hero store.
4133304	4134565	It got knocked down to $79.
4135245	4141130	From what I understand, though, this thing got sold out very soon, so I don't think you can actually get this anymore.
4141470	4148935	But it is still telling and worthy of reporting on that the price is already coming down, meaning that maybe it's just a matter of time before this ends up in the bargain bins.
4149016	4149436	I don't know.
4149676	4157021	And as I tweeted earlier this week, the MPD numbers came out and it's sold 303,000 units total.
4157061	4158082	Well, now that's not bad.
4158523	4158943	In two months?
4158963	4159543	No, it's not bad.
4159583	4160284	That's not bad at all.
4160324	4162405	Or actually, technically one month, about.
4162445	4163406	One month and a week or so.
4163426	4165308	It'll probably still sell a little more before Christmas.
4165328	4167189	Do you think it's worthy enough of getting a sequel then?
4167731	4169652	Oh yeah.
4169812	4171312	And Guitar Hero rocks the 80s?
4171552	4172272	Or spins the 80s?
4172332	4172732	I'm sorry.
4173813	4174193	I forget.
4174213	4175733	Joke gone wrong.
4175933	4176794	I would be all over that.
4176814	4177694	That'd be pretty awesome.
4177734	4185356	But no, my problem with DJ Hero, and it's the same problem that I have with the Guitar Hero series, is there's not enough download content.
4185396	4187877	We've had two so far.
4188297	4189377	I mean, come on, man.
4189397	4191378	Both have been pretty good for what it's worth.
4191418	4196299	But if this was a Harmonix game, I'd be getting download content every fucking week.
4198348	4199369	Rock Band 2, The Best Buy Demo
4217827	4218287	Street Fighter Alpha
4235020	4262471	as well as the arcade version of Shinobi and Rayman for the DSi which I thought was kind of interesting is now out so that's a big title on DSi lots of other stuff available on DSi including Ball Fighter, Pop Island, Army Defender and My Notebook not a lot of exciting stuff on WiiWare but of course the Virtual Console got the arcade version of Shinobi and Street Fighter Alpha for the Super Nintendo so if you were a fan of Alpha back in the day you might want to go grab that
4263191	4263674	DarkSakura
4267645	4272847	Well, in other news, we have something that actually I'm pretty considering trying out.
4273287	4277748	It's a Voltron game on the iPhone and apparently has the best unpause feature.
4279809	4283850	It's actually being put out for the 25th anniversary of the series.
4284470	4296254	So you've got 30 levels, 6 acts total, where you go, you play as the lions going through the galaxy to stop Zarkon and everybody and, you know, all the weapons and everything.
4298917	4325258	and um it's actually uh supposed to be i think pretty neat but um there's a video up here actually that i can um i haven't watched it yet but apparently the the unpause sound effect is supposed to be amazing are they i imagine they're like rips from voltron or something probably i'm gonna check this out all right because i'm i oh there's stupid ads
4326707	4327507	So now let's go back to Voltron.
4357151	4358732	Yeah, someone talking about it.
4363056	4363997	Blah, blah, blah, blah.
4364057	4364537	Oh, there we go.
4366939	4368440	See, no one can hear any of this.
4369561	4370822	I'm trying to find the unpause.
4375286	4376427	So, it's the sound effects.
4379409	4384513	It sounds like the music in the game is actually from... Dude, you have Sven when you start off.
4384533	4384993	That's cool.
4385494	4385714	Anyway...
4386846	4389728	Moving forward, how about some rock band stuff?
4390388	4390828	Rock band.
4391789	4392509	Rubber Soul!
4392790	4393330	Finally!
4393870	4395291	Finally, finally, finally.
4395431	4397732	Very happy, because that's my favorite Beatles album.
4398693	4403376	So, we are going to be getting Rubber Soul next week for a Beatles rock band.
4405637	4406858	Because we already got Sgt.
4406898	4408839	Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road.
4409479	4409800	And then...
4411801	4415563	We are also going to be for the other Rock Band.
4415583	4419224	We'll be getting All-American Rejects, 30 Seconds to Mars, and more Green Day.
4420244	4427728	And Rock Band unplugged download content is... I'm not sure.
4430028	4434410	It actually isn't going to be getting any more download content from what it seems.
4434950	4436051	So, that's it.
4437199	4440721	By the way, some late-breaking news, I believe, speaking of the whole Rock Band thing.
4440761	4448645	Apparently, there's this teaser going on on MTV.com about this whole, I guess, Green Day Rock Band game.
4448705	4451627	Is there possibly a Rock Band game going on with Green Day in it?
4451647	4454069	I don't think it's going to be as big as, like, Beatles Rock Band.
4454109	4455829	It may be, like, an add-on content thing.
4456470	4460792	And we've speculated this before, like the ACDC game was.
4461112	4461333	Yeah.
4461473	4461653	Yeah.
4463595	4468840	This might be something that actually shows up during the VGAs, which I guess are happening later tonight.
4468920	4473545	Green Day is okay, but do you really think they're popular enough to warrant their own game?
4474326	4476568	You've got to live up to the Beatles.
4476989	4477189	That's...
4478359	4479180	VGA's are on tonight
4513766	4514386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4537493	4541494	I find it odd that I host this show and I know really very little about what's going on here.
4541554	4543955	So I'm very curious to see it.
4543995	4544515	So there you go.
4546375	4546815	Let's see.
4549756	4553497	Some people talking about listening to the show or not listening to the show tonight.
4553957	4554497	Let's see.
4554617	4560279	Going to Leo Shen on Twitter says, Any songs from a recent game that you can't get out of your head?
4560699	4564060	For me it's Bayonetta's Fly Me to the Moon Climax Mix.
4565498	4566439	I thought that was kind of funny.
4567420	4570263	My friend's like, hey, isn't this from Neo Genesis?
4570623	4574207	Yeah, and a bunch of other stuff.
4574227	4577250	Awesome game.
4580058	4583221	I don't know if I have a song stuck in my head, especially not one from a video game.
4583481	4589788	For the longest time, though, I had that mix of Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige from the download of DJ Hero.
4589808	4591470	That would get stuck in my head so easily.
4591510	4596535	A lot of the stuff from DJ Hero is stuck in my head because I played in my car on repeat, basically.
4596775	4601060	A lot of bus moves around the world, you know?
4601684	4602525	That's a good mix.
4602545	4604786	That's a game I haven't played in forever that I really need to.
4606228	4608629	Old school, bust a move, groove, whatever you want to call it.
4609850	4610271	Let's see.
4610391	4621159	Also, SSJ100Matt on Twitter is saying, Target is having some nice game deals starting this Sunday, including DJ Hero $88 and Zelda Spirit Tracks $25.
4621219	4625162	That was another game I forgot to mention that I was playing this week.
4626143	4628765	It's alright, but my thing is...
4630498	4638282	It's not the same as the other games where the method of travel by boat was kind of a necessity.
4638982	4643944	The fact that they're like, oh no, we can't go to these parts of the land because the tracks have disappeared.
4644245	4647966	That's just to me saying, I'm lazy and I don't want to walk there.
4648987	4653569	It's like fucking walking was all you did in Zelda, Zelda 2, Zelda 3 even.
4656226	4660231	But now I'm too good for walking, I need to take a train everywhere.
4671508	4672549	I want another Wind Waker
4693484	4695005	I mean, they keep putting out these DS games.
4695065	4698448	Let's do another GameCube-style game or whatever, because Wind Waker is awesome.
4698468	4699568	I need to go back and actually play it.
4699588	4702811	A lot of people disagree with you, but... Well... They can suck it, right?
4703111	4704412	They can suck it, because guess what?
4704792	4708935	How many games have we seen that have been emulating the Wind Waker style being released?
4709035	4710056	Well, at least two of them.
4710376	4715000	How many games have we seen emulating the style of the Marie Lissig Zelda?
4715960	4716060	One.
4717641	4718242	So tough.
4719011	4719972	Alright, well we'll see.
4720052	4721813	Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight.
4722073	4724254	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to give us a follow.
4724655	4728077	Meanwhile, back to some more gaming news and then our mailbag before too long.
4729636	4740238	Yes, there's a new patent that's been put out for the Sony motion controller and it's showing a new feature including swappable buttons or like some sort of connector.
4740658	4750440	Basically, at the top of the controller or possibly even the bottom, I don't know, they show this kind of like upside down with the cosmic ice cream cone facing down.
4751480	4756921	Apparently, there is a little spot that you could possibly put in either a D-pad, they have like the...
4759039	4760480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4788311	4791813	But honestly, I don't see what the point is in adding face buttons to it.
4791913	4799076	I mean, when you just have some generic buttons and if you want to use them... I don't know, it gives some more diversity for the developers.
4799197	4801658	I would just worry about losing that shit.
4801758	4802798	Those things look small.
4802918	4805260	I would think losing them would be the problem.
4805680	4807100	These little convertible things.
4807301	4817045	Well, not only that, but I would think, though, that the directional pad or whatever could be easily done with just four buttons like the face buttons, so there's no need to double up on that.
4817106	4817866	And the jog dial...
4819864	4821585	I don't really see why they would need that.
4824386	4826968	To spin the wheel in a Wheel of Fortune game, I don't know.
4827548	4830350	But they make the movement with the whole motion controller.
4831690	4841016	This is about, like, I don't know if you saw the article about Ubisoft with their crappy camera that they put out with that Your Self Fitness thing or whatever.
4841536	4842616	Your Shape, actually.
4843777	4849160	And they have a new racquetball game coming out to kind of compete with Wii Sports, Tennis, or whatever.
4849561	4852322	And it uses, as an option, it uses the camera.
4852663	4856205	Well, all the previews I've seen using this camera have been crap.
4857025	4859947	Toagak in chat says, Have you ever dealt with a DS game card before?
4860027	4861068	Those are easy to lose.
4861608	4865050	Like saying that, you know, well, these things aren't much bigger than a DS card, probably.
4865150	4868552	So if you can keep track of a DS game card, you can probably keep track of these little things.
4869313	4869573	Maybe.
4870373	4872735	Maybe, but like, there's got to be an easier way to do this.
4874639	4876983	Well, and it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be true.
4877264	4883154	You know, it's just generally patents so that no patent whores try to get in there and, you know, patent it first.
4883534	4885097	I will just sue them 10 years down the road.
4885177	4886600	You know, they always seem to do that.
4887828	4898538	Star Trek Online is coming out next year, and of course there's quite a few people excited about that, including our very own DarkSakura, and I gotta admit, I am pretty excited about it too, even though I'm a big WoW whore, and I gotta say, lovin' the new patch 3.3.
4899179	4900440	I didn't say this during my gaming week.
4900560	4902022	Actually, I like it too.
4902102	4908288	Well, I've noticed that it flashes red now when you're being attacked, and it's sort of like, what the hell?
4908588	4909869	Oh, I'm being attacked!
4910249	4911711	Instead of just random roar...
4912111	4915913	And the quest tracking thing, if you didn't have a mod for that before, is pretty awesome.
4916273	4918094	I used a quest helper mod, so I already had that.
4918214	4922276	And I gotta say, this whole dungeon finder is awesome.
4922696	4923577	Yeah!
4923657	4925938	All the looking for group stuff is gone now.
4926258	4927059	It's crazy.
4927439	4931941	And I gotta be honest, all the groups I've gotten through the system have been really good.
4932401	4935843	Like, I have yet to get a group full of douchebags like I used to get before.
4935943	4936723	I don't know what it is.
4937184	4941466	It's not like they have a filter on what kind of players get to use the group system, but...
4941966	4943567	I've just gotten a lot of really good players.
4943907	4947069	Maybe that it requires a little bit more intelligence to use it?
4947549	4947929	I don't know.
4948290	4948590	I don't know.
4948630	4949390	Very, very exciting.
4949450	4951631	Anyway, but we want to get back to Star Trek Online.
4952132	4956994	Star Trek Online, of course, is coming out soon and a whole shitload of pre-order bonuses.
4957074	4960716	But of course, it depends on where you pre-order it.
4960756	4961257	That's right.
4962097	4965718	And depending on where you pre-order, Star Trek Online will change the bonus that you get.
4966098	4971099	So, for example, if you pre-order the game at GameStop, you can have the classic USS Enterprise.
4971359	4973040	You can only get the classic Enterprise at GameStop.
4973440	4976320	So there's going to be everybody riding around the USS Enterprise.
4976840	4977220	I guess.
4977360	4977681	I don't know.
4978661	4982562	At the Best Buy, you can get a Pet Tribble or a Targ, depending on what your faction is.
4982622	4983762	Dude, totally want a Targ.
4985026	5007249	and everybody knows when you get one pet tribble it's actually hundreds of pet tribbles if you pre-order on Amazon you get a liberated Borg bridge officer with unique nanotechnology augmentation so in other words you can have sex of nine as your bridge officer there whose name is Poopy I actually totally think that I'm going to get mine on Amazon now because I've actually got a gift card for Amazon do you really?
5010294	5014480	Direct2Drive, a multi-spatial personal shield.
5014801	5016784	It regenerates itself and the player health.
5020034	5021616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5042237	5044341	Those are all game-changing items.
5044361	5049932	That's a little weird to me that depending on where you buy the game can kind of change up the game for you.
5051311	5056273	I mean, I imagine even these little items they talk about aren't like the best things in the game.
5056614	5059875	It seems to me, I gotta be honest, it sounds, the Walmart one sounds good.
5059935	5066378	If you get extra skill points that you can't get any other way, that seems like the best deal right there.
5066418	5069820	But it seems to me, though, that, well, are they completely unique?
5069840	5071141	I mean, does it say specific?
5071601	5076143	Because, I mean, if you can get skill points as you keep going, you know, as you level, then what's the point?
5076503	5079205	What kind of skills can you get from Walmart anyways?
5079305	5079465	I mean...
5081346	5082486	Out of Dress.
5082646	5087609	Which one had the, what was it, the transphasic shield?
5088950	5091992	Direct to Drive has the shield that regenerates itself in your health.
5093072	5094833	I mean, I can imagine a Walmart bonus being like,
5096089	5102257	You know, you get to command the Enterprise, except the Enterprise has a new paint job with a Confederate flag on it.
5104080	5110248	Honestly, I think I wouldn't really want the classic Enterprise anyway, because given when the game is set, it's like driving...
5113706	5114246	A hooptie.
5114346	5117688	I gotta be honest, the GameStop pre-order sounds the least interesting to me.
5117728	5118388	I've gotta be honest.
5118648	5121770	This is Star Trek Online, not remake Star Trek The Next Generation.
5122030	5128974	Well, it'd be the equivalent of everyone driving around in a brand new Bugatti, right?
5129494	5132715	And you're driving a 1983 Ford Escort.
5134556	5134796	Nice.
5135117	5135637	Seriously.
5136737	5137678	A Geo Metro.
5138311	5142954	I'm a pet whore though, and wow, so I'm almost down for this Best Buy pet Tribble.
5143094	5143934	That sounds kind of awesome.
5144095	5146316	Is that the only way you're going to be able to get this pet Tribble?
5146356	5149598	I mean, is there going to be a Tribble wearing a Best Buy shirt or something like that?
5149977	5150458	Don't know.
5150478	5157366	You can't get a... And besides that, the whole... You can... Although I'm sure the Tribbles are actually 90% reproductive organs.
5159348	5162472	You can just feed them very little and they won't have enough energy to breed.
5162632	5165415	A few comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.com on this story.
5165635	5168639	Vanis Lux says, Exclusive Walmart greeter class.
5168959	5169919	Maybe that's what you get at Walmart.
5170540	5179704	SalaciousPop says, you're not going to know how or what to min to max if you're just starting, and 99% of the MMOs nerf a lot of stuff within the first 90 days.
5180564	5185567	SSJ100Matt says, you can probably buy those devices and armor bonuses in some sort of store in the game.
5186267	5188448	And BauerCTU says, I want the Classic Enterprise.
5190307	5191907	So, you know, screw what I think.
5192348	5200470	No, obviously there will be a lot of people that want it, and there'll probably be a lot of them in-game, because GameStop is obviously still a very, very big retailer where a lot of people are going to get this.
5201090	5207772	But just so you know, there's choices, so if Star Trek Online is really important to you, you might want to think around about where you pre-order the game.
5208752	5212073	I'll probably end up getting it on Steam, so I don't have to go outside the house, but we'll see.
5212333	5212653	DarkSakura
5231912	5259037	well in other stuff yay other stuff thanks Rob PS3 actually won Metacritic's console of the year they did a big survey on it and actually the higher rated games came out higher rated games were on Xbox 360 than PS3 but the winner overall though was still the PS3
5260948	5262389	Which is kind of crap.
5262409	5265471	But then again, Uncharted 2, you know, meh.
5267193	5269635	And the Wii did okay on the thing too.
5269755	5277881	But I mean, and also to keep going further into the list though, the best rated Xbox game was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
5278881	5280943	And Metroid Prime Trilogy was on Wii.
5281023	5283465	Street Fighter 4 scored the best for PC.
5283925	5286847	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was number one on PSP and DS.
5287508	5287588	So.
5289702	5301289	This seems like one of those stories that's just there to start a controversy, to get the Sony fanboys and the Microsoft fanboys all riled up.
5301970	5304211	But it's been a good year for Sony.
5304271	5310495	The price drop was what they needed to do three years ago, and it's finally bringing a lot of people on board.
5310515	5312036	And I've heard a lot of people talk about...
5312416	5315977	How they're probably going to take the plunge and get the PS3 now, you know, with Blu-ray and so forth.
5316617	5318477	I think they're going to have a really good Christmas season.
5318517	5319858	I mean, we'll see when the numbers come out.
5320418	5321978	Certainly Microsoft's not out.
5322498	5322998	Hell no.
5323659	5325439	They've already sold millions of consoles.
5325479	5329640	I think this is going to be, I think there's going to be a lot of people that just simply have more than one console in this day and age.
5330040	5330240	You know?
5331260	5331400	So.
5332540	5332801	Alright.
5333721	5334341	Um, let's see.
5334501	5337542	We'll move on to some more news stories and then we'll get to the mailbag in just a minute here.
5338142	5338342	Yes.
5339222	5339342	Um.
5340396	5341217	So this is kind of neat.
5341617	5351705	We had a game that just came out, Avatar, that supported 3D with, you know, actually stereoscopic 3D with TVs that supported, you know, 3D gaming.
5352806	5354787	Some of the 120 megahertz TVs.
5355028	5356469	Is that because movies are supposed to be in 3D too?
5356869	5357970	Yes, it is.
5358731	5364017	It's kind of neat, though, because Avatar, actually, it was... It's dependent on which TV it is.
5364037	5374307	They had a bunch of different options that you could do, including Real D was one of those, which you find in a lot of the cinemas nowadays, which is the polarized glasses.
5374788	5375008	Well...
5376104	5376865	Soul Calibur V
5395051	5396471	I don't know, but it's neat.
5396792	5398552	I mean, and I think this is the way games are going to go.
5398592	5400793	Yeah, but how many TVs are fitted for this?
5400873	5401593	I mean... Not many.
5402113	5405794	And the thing is, not only do you have to have these TVs, you have to have those glasses, too.
5405954	5408235	So, the Real D wouldn't be bad.
5408355	5414177	If you could do the Real D stuff, like, on your TV, I mean, because that's just a... It's polarized glasses.
5414197	5416717	I mean, those glasses cost, like, five bucks.
5416777	5418618	I mean, that would be, I think, the way to go.
5418938	5421919	When you get the more expensive, like, shutter glasses, you know, they're actual...
5422816	5425018	Hardware that have timing and everything.
5425918	5430722	That might be a little bit difficult, but I think it's almost like pushing the technology too quick.
5430762	5433844	I mean, we just got people sort of adopted to HDTVs.
5434004	5435506	Not everybody's kind of on board with that.
5435666	5438067	I can't believe this Avatar game's already supporting it.
5438087	5439188	It seems so early.
5440109	5441590	I hear it's good, though.
5441610	5446434	I hear that Avatar's whole thing is really pushing what they do with cinema now, but...
5446974	5447214	Man.
5447535	5459724	And by the way, Tigerclaws, Lincoln and Chad, apparently, even though I was bagging on the movie a little bit last week about how I kind of don't look interested in it, Avatar the movie apparently has an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.
5460324	5463006	So, I guess some people are being pretty wowed by it.
5463587	5464167	By the game?
5464808	5465508	No, the movie.
5465528	5465748	The movie?
5466349	5467029	It's not out yet.
5467710	5471533	Well, it had its premiere in London, so some critics were probably there.
5471813	5472914	It's probably had its critics screening.
5474054	5474235	Well...
5475103	5481687	I'm going to go see it, and in 3D, because that's the way it's meant to be seen, but if it's crap, then I'll call it.
5481947	5482868	Are you going to see it by Sunday?
5482888	5485289	Review it on next week's show?
5486229	5486630	I don't know.
5486950	5491232	I want to go see it with my dad, because the wife does not want to see that movie.
5491452	5492253	I see.
5493314	5495355	And I think he's gone, so I may not be able to see it.
5495855	5497036	She may go see it, though.
5497056	5499897	I'm sure some of our chatters will let us know next week, if nothing else.
5499917	5500918	We're definitely going to see it next week.
5501626	5503729	I will give you a review of Princess and the Frog next week.
5503769	5504610	I'm going to see that tomorrow.
5504630	5505512	I want to see that too.
5506033	5507936	Maybe you'll see that tomorrow.
5507976	5509839	That you could probably get the wife to see.
5511101	5514386	I do remember now she does want to see Avatar because she said it looked neat.
5514987	5515468	Oh, there you go.
5517372	5523478	Alright, let's see, moving on to another story here about something probably the wife wouldn't be interested in at all.
5523598	5525180	I don't know, Loki, maybe she would be.
5525580	5535750	Bible Adventures is a new game that's coming out from Left Behind Games, which I want to say I remember reporting on the fact that the studio was developed quite some time ago.
5536711	5538132	Do the Left Behind Game.
5538352	5538553	Mm-hmm.
5539628	5542192	So now they're doing Bible Adventures as their new game.
5542573	5549163	It's going to educate young children by teaching them academic lessons vital to early childhood development through Bible stories.
5549604	5553651	So in other words, it's gonna be throwing the Bible at them at an early age.
5554019	5558021	You know, I could see this maybe being more of like a downloadable game.
5558242	5560383	I mean, that would be a little bit more popular, I think.
5560483	5562324	No, it's coming out as an actual game.
5562344	5563285	I don't want to sell this.
5563985	5570089	Not that I don't like selling, you know, not to have anything against the Bible or anything, but I don't want to sell that.
5570169	5572831	I mean, just like, you need this because people love the Bible.
5573752	5576435	Anyway, it's based on the Charlie Churchmouse stories.
5576495	5583983	It's going to span both of the Old and the New Testament, and it will teach mathematics, spelling, and I love this, reasoning skills.
5585665	5586626	WWJD.
5589329	5591332	I prefer WWTF.
5591812	5593394	IDGAF.
5594762	5595883	WWGD.
5597064	5608814	Anyhow, the CEO of Left Behind has said that they expect their financial projections to grow exponentially as they transition from a PC game developer to a Wii and Xbox developer.
5608854	5609255	That's right.
5609595	5612618	Bible Adventures apparently is coming out for the Wii and the Xbox 360.
5613398	5614099	And I love this.
5614819	5620845	Joystick, who ran this story, one of the many sites who ran the story this week, said, but what about PS3 owners?
5621245	5622066	Well, they can go to hell.
5622754	5623695	And then the link, though.
5623775	5625037	The link is for Dante's Inferno.
5625057	5625217	I know.
5625237	5625617	I love it.
5626318	5626979	It's funny.
5627059	5627479	I lulled.
5629041	5629722	You know what, though?
5631263	5633306	Like it or not, there's a market for this stuff.
5635568	5637270	They'll sell these in those Christian bookstores.
5637310	5641775	I just want to know when we're getting dance praise or whatever the guitar hero equivalent was.
5641815	5642456	Guitar praise?
5642476	5642876	Yeah, I remember that.
5642896	5643537	Guitar praise or...
5644944	5646224	DJ Praise.
5646244	5647245	Where's DJ Praise?
5647685	5647865	What?
5648205	5648945	DJ Praise.
5648965	5649505	DJ Praise?
5650605	5651786	Maybe you should make that game, Loki.
5651846	5652626	No, I shouldn't.
5654926	5655226	All right.
5655266	5655966	Anyhow, forget it.
5656327	5657607	Let's move on to the mailbag.
5657647	5663048	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelawnradio.com and DarkSakura jumps into the mailbag head first.
5663128	5663688	And deletes them.
5663848	5665529	And instantly deletes them.
5666149	5671330	But not before she picks out a few of her favorites to read here on the air in a segment we call The Mailbag.
5674694	5675996	Starting with an awful joke.
5676316	5677658	So it's from AZHP.
5678278	5683444	Hi OLR crew, AZHP here celebrating the release of the new Silent Hill Wii game with a crude joke for everyone.
5683965	5685426	Yay!
5686187	5690392	What do you call what happens to your boobs after Pyramid Head rapes you?
5690992	5692294	Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
5694861	5700644	Now that we've got that out of the way, have you guys heard about the Silent Hill stage play planned for Sweden?
5700684	5701444	Yes, we already did that.
5702385	5712270	If it's as good as the last Konami spinoff play I wrote into the show about DDR the musical, then I'm sure we can all say that we're extremely excited to see what comes out of this.
5712670	5718693	There aren't any details besides the flyer, which has been making the rounds on gaming blogs, but it's Silent Hill, so it's plenty enough to get excited about.
5718733	5719174	Am I right?
5720154	5722335	TTFN, ta-ta for now, is EHP.
5722956	5723676	Yeah, we covered that.
5724605	5727986	By the way, AZHP, I got this for you for your joke.
5729427	5729647	Oh, wait.
5731608	5732488	Sound cue fail.
5732869	5734589	Now this is for me and AZHP.
5739331	5742033	We just need to get one of those fancy mixing boards with the buttons.
5742053	5742473	Yes, we do.
5742513	5744054	We need a fancy mixing board with buttons.
5744094	5744694	Let's get on that.
5745254	5748095	I will get on that because you already told me what to do.
5750837	5752457	Next up comes from Gray Fox.
5753698	5753958	Dear...
5754679	5755139	OLR.
5755880	5756741	I need your help.
5757541	5757721	No.
5758442	5758982	Give me a dollar.
5759222	5760924	You're not cheating enough then.
5779657	5789760	Now with so much of my time being taken up by other interests, I find myself having less time for games and I'm finding myself remembering my relentless quests across Hyrule or summoning some ridiculously large beast in Final Fantasy.
5790280	5794101	So I've asked myself if other people have encountered the same thing.
5795162	5795382	Yes.
5797522	5797742	Yes.
5798383	5799823	I don't have patience anymore.
5800954	5802335	I also have life.
5802795	5803956	I have gamer ADD.
5804056	5805897	I have told this on the show many, many times.
5806018	5809540	I have the worst case of gamer ADD and it's not helping my wallet.
5809620	5810981	I will buy $60 games.
5811041	5813142	I swear to God I play them once and then never play them again.
5813222	5814683	It's a disgusting, filthy habit.
5814723	5815384	I need to stop.
5815524	5817205	I have a game right over here that I haven't played yet, Rob.
5817225	5818486	You should stay and play it with me sometime.
5819266	5819687	Sometime, yeah.
5819707	5820507	I have Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
5820547	5821848	You still haven't played that?
5821868	5822869	You've had that for like two months.
5823169	5824590	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5847792	5857295	To be honest, I've taken a liking to independent games like Bit.Trip Beat and World of Goo because I can usually beat the games within a few weeks.
5857736	5861097	Which makes me wonder if I'm no different from when I first started playing games like Mario Bros.
5861137	5861657	or Duck Hunt.
5861997	5863538	So this brings me back to my original question.
5863638	5864298	Am I crazy?
5864338	5865238	Am I thinking too much?
5865298	5866459	Help me out, Gray Fox.
5866479	5869340	Dude, just play whatever's fun.
5869400	5870480	If it's not fun, don't play it.
5871000	5872621	Don't force yourself into a mold you don't fit in.
5872941	5874642	And I think tastes change with time.
5874983	5877404	And maybe it does have something to do with age.
5877484	5879786	I don't know, because I had much more patience when I was little.
5880287	5885290	Because I play some of those 8-bit games now, and I don't have the patience to collect everything like I used to when I was a kid.
5885310	5890935	And there's also a lot of peer pressure out there to be playing certain games, like the popular ones, like you'd be in the crowd.
5891035	5892356	Like Smoking Crack, the game.
5892396	5896999	Yet, yet, I spend hours upon hours upon hours on World of Warcrack.
5897420	5897940	Go figure.
5898440	5900181	I mean, some of those are just good, though.
5900521	5912126	But I think part of it with an MMO is that because it is something that you can just pick up, play for a little bit, and put away, it has that casual aspect on it unless you're, like, I guess one of those freaks that goes raiding.
5915367	5915907	Hey.
5915927	5916808	I don't go like I used to.
5916888	5918768	Raiding kind of ruined WoW for a little while for me.
5919049	5921850	But keep in mind, for that, that's also a social aspect.
5922290	5922590	It is.
5922750	5922950	It is.
5922990	5923470	It really is.
5923610	5927232	For me, when I play, I play with, like...
5929133	5936857	I've described World of Warcraft to friends that I have that don't get the Warcraft obsession or just are curious about it.
5937217	5941599	I will say it's like a chat room with fireballs is World of Warcraft for me.
5943345	5948148	And it's kind of neat because friends I have who might live across the country, it gives us a chance.
5948208	5949929	I know this is going to sound so dorky and nerdy.
5950190	5950430	I know.
5950510	5951110	I agree with that.
5951230	5956674	It gives us a chance to hang out and do something, even though, yes, I understand it's not real life.
5956714	5960176	But keep in mind, I'm talking about friends that live states and states and thousands of miles away.
5960476	5964719	We get to kind of do something together, even if it's not, you know, going outside.
5965300	5966080	So take that as you will.
5966100	5967001	No, I completely agree with that.
5967021	5969522	I have the same logic about it, actually.
5970143	5973145	So we've got one more email from Jim Sally.
5974026	5974446	DeadPixelLive.com
5994831	6002794	Um, that last week was, uh, we got a lot of compliments on last week's show, which is weird because I didn't think we did anything special, but talk about more porn than usual.
6002874	6004154	So I guess the chatters like porn.
6004174	6004454	I don't know.
6005094	6010256	Um, as far as I remember what we did, um, I don't know the latest update from last week.
6010436	6015718	My thought is they are, they had a epilogue, but they're still on the schedule.
6015798	6017858	So they might, they're still doing something.
6018238	6019639	So keep an eye on all games.com.
6019659	6023480	I think they have their own website at dead pixel live.com.
6023940	6026081	and you can check out what's going on there.
6026201	6033343	I have not heard that they have left the network or anything like that so I don't know if they're just going through some changes over there or what's going on.
6034103	6036764	But usually when shows change and stuff I'm like the last to hear about it.
6037204	6040285	On Sunday night people are kind of self-sufficient I suppose.
6040305	6042786	They don't keep us in the loop on what's going on the rest of the week.
6042846	6043166	I don't know.
6043606	6045887	I still have glue on my fingers.
6048348	6048768	F.U.s of the week
6087669	6089830	F you to the situation with my mother.
6090491	6093412	That's all I'm going to say.
6093552	6095393	Not to my mother, just with the situation.
6101016	6102277	F you to having a cold.
6105999	6108500	Rob, I'm just going to take this moment to say, there's a...
6108936	6111919	There's a couple arcade cabinets in Rancho Cordova for $25 each.
6112439	6114641	Missing a monitor, but they'll sell you a monitor for $50.
6115002	6118906	You can get a Street Fighter 2 cabinet working for $75.
6120247	6121148	God, that's tempting.
6122349	6122609	Arrgh!
6123948	6126169	And they're in ranches, so maybe they'll deliver to you, huh?
6126189	6126929	Maybe, I don't know.
6127969	6128130	Sorry.
6129010	6130510	Um, I don't really have a lot of FUs of the week.
6130550	6134032	I actually had, like, a really good week, all things considered.
6134152	6140774	So, um, I don't really have a lot of angsty stuff, except maybe FU to being exhausted after work on Friday.
6140834	6142094	Like, I just wanted to go home and die.
6142154	6143135	And I did, I slept for an hour.
6143515	6144135	So, there you go.
6145316	6148677	And FU to the rain causing people to drive like crazy.
6148717	6150998	It took twice as long to get here as it usually does.
6151918	6152158	Rawr.
6153373	6154774	All right, that's going to do it for the FU's of the week.
6155515	6156836	No story to inspire it tonight.
6157236	6159178	Everybody's been fairly well behaved out in the world.
6159478	6163741	Just a couple more stories and then we'll get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6164322	6167044	But first, some more stories, Loki.
6167244	6173389	Yes, they had an interesting, or there's going to be an interesting update coming to Team Fortress 2.
6174070	6179274	But what's more interesting than the update itself is how they're deciding who will get the update.
6179734	6181215	And I guess during the week, you will be able to...
6203737	6207279	Get the update for the Soldier by becoming the Soldier and killing the Demoman.
6208079	6212421	And if you want the Demoman to get the update, you need to go kill the Soldier as the Demoman.
6213301	6214842	So, that's kind of neat.
6216303	6219964	And it's apparently the, of course, the update's called The War.
6222746	6223366	That's kind of cool.
6223726	6230629	You know, Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that they've done a very good job supporting for quite some time since its release.
6231109	6231950	So, there you go.
6234112	6239397	Also, it says the update will award three new weapons to both the Soldier and Demoman classes.
6239897	6243660	Weapons will be revealed piecemeal over the course of next week.
6243780	6248705	However, two classes will be fighting during the week to unlock a secret fourth weapon for their profession.
6251226	6252787	Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot Mad Max
6281742	6288004	What the game will do there is it's actually adding some new Riot Mode arenas for single player and co-op.
6288044	6296886	There's going to be a bank where you can store your weapons and the whole thing's going to cost you 800 Microsoft points or that would be 10 real dollars and that's how much they're charging on the PS3.
6297946	6300907	They're saying also it's an entirely new game mode.
6301427	6307049	They're comparing it to Smash TV in co-op first person shooter in the Borderlands.
6307129	6308089	That does sound kind of awesome.
6308869	6310190	So there you go.
6310570	6314273	SalaciousPop in our chatroom at chat.orangehauntsradio.com calls it a first-person looter.
6315134	6315654	So there you go.
6317776	6324521	All right, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR where we will take your calls right now if you want to go ahead and give us a call.
6324862	6327243	By the way, I just want to say I followed up in chat.
6328206	6354983	to one of the emails because I noticed that Derek from Dead Pixel Live was in the All Games chat while we were getting asked that question on the mailbag and he said that it is coming back at 7.30 on Monday after a brief cancellation so there you go so stay tuned to All Games Radio and check that out and I'm assuming 7.30 is Eastern because I know that show used to come on at like 3.30 Pacific it was kind of early for us over here so I think it's just going to be on at a slightly different time so check that out
6356092	6361475	Alright, and of course, for all the ladies, you can always check allgames.com for the latest goings on at All Games Radio.
6361535	6362955	Hey, we are getting some calls, believe it or not.
6362995	6364116	Let's go to the phones and take them.
6364456	6365476	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6365496	6365897	Who's this?
6367237	6368098	Hi, guys.
6368118	6369338	This is Spazinator.
6369378	6370059	Hi, Spazinator.
6370079	6370699	What's on your mind, buddy?
6372425	6382448	Yeah, I just want to comment on the little story that you guys said a little while ago about firmware update 3.15 for PS3.
6382688	6384949	Yeah, the latest update on PlayStation 3.
6385009	6385829	Have you checked it out?
6385849	6386289	You used it?
6386309	6386649	What's up?
6389050	6393091	There's a slight hitch with the update.
6393891	6397713	Even though the update on the PlayStation 3 is in place...
6399585	6407206	You can't exactly take full use of playing the minis on your PlayStation 3 just yet.
6407366	6412067	Yeah, we did note earlier when we were covering it that not all the games are playable.
6412147	6417528	Like, I guess some of the newer ones and a sprinkling of the old ones you can do, but not all of the new ones.
6417548	6419929	Like, I guess they're going to, like, patch that in later or something, right?
6421249	6422369	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
6422749	6428210	Yeah, in fact, you know, I talked to you guys, a few other sites made note of this, and
6430124	6452994	I guess that I don't have all the details in place just yet, so I don't want to give out any bad information, but I'm guessing that they're going to arrange stuff in such a way on the PSN store that will make it easier to figure out.
6453720	6459582	which ones you can play on your PlayStation 3 as opposed to which ones that still haven't been updated.
6459682	6462863	Well, I'm hoping that they get them all playable before too long.
6463223	6464384	I guess that's the idea, right?
6465704	6466345	Oh, yeah, really.
6466545	6471486	Yeah, the one thing I definitely want to get in the play is Tetris.
6471526	6475528	Yeah, I know it's available on virtually every console known to man.
6476246	6479787	But, you know, Tetris is pretty much a classic game.
6506318	6508741	Let's imagine that technically it's possible.
6509202	6510923	Let's just throw the technical aspect out of it.
6510963	6511604	Technically it's possible.
6511925	6512846	Should Sony do it?
6514547	6519193	From a consumer standpoint, I'd say hell yeah.
6519233	6522416	However, from a strictly business standpoint...
6528933	6539522	I don't think it would make sense, because I would imagine from Sony's standpoint they would probably lose money, so it's all a matter of how you want to look at it.
6540142	6554774	I'm all for playing your games, the PSD games on the PS3, but unless things really come to a push, come to a shove, I really don't see it happening, though.
6555514	6557275	I don't see it happening either, but it's too bad.
6557315	6564560	Because I can also see the business standpoint of the fact that where it might not then motivate the sale of systems, what it will motivate the sale of is the games.
6564740	6568223	I mean, you know, and all the games that are available right there on the store for digital download.
6568503	6571785	There's some stuff I would freaking love to play on the PS3.
6572125	6575187	Like the Final Fantasy remakes, even though I don't think those are in the store yet.
6575227	6577849	But maybe like the Castlevania game that came out by Konami.
6578129	6580711	You know, there's a lot of games I would love to play on the TV.
6581051	6584213	Although, I know, I could use a video out cable if I want to do that.
6585254	6587996	Maybe I want the convenience of not having to do all that.
6589337	6606952	You know, on a somewhat related note, you know, one thing that I think virtually every time you can hear a replacement of Damage would like to see is, you know, somehow they really bring back PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility.
6607172	6614138	You know, I know the early models, you know, PlayStation 3 had it, and they kind of weeded it out.
6615330	6627610	and, you know, they're trying to tinker with the look and with the God of War collection and Call of Duty Classic, but, you know, I would love to be able to
6628206	6631088	Play all my old PlayStation 2 games all over again.
6658486	6660608	Nothing to think of, but thanks for taking my call, Will.
6675508	6676268	Thank you for watching!
6698717	6699478	I'll just have to create Loki.
6699498	6701079	And I'll kick anybody who doesn't show up.
6701239	6702700	I'll just have to create Loki's porn hut.
6703200	6703440	You do.
6703500	6704541	You need to make Loki's porn hut.
6704841	6705842	But for now, we've got another call.
6705882	6706803	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6706823	6707143	Who's this?
6707803	6708784	Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
6708864	6709585	Hey, hey, what's up?
6710305	6711086	Not too much.
6711506	6712346	A couple of things.
6712386	6713507	I'll be on my merry little way.
6713687	6717210	Number one, I just had my 360 replaced yet again.
6717810	6718231	Again?
6718271	6718731	What happened?
6720047	6729192	Um, I got the dreaded disk read error, and because Best Buy screwed up the first time around when exchanging my console, I got it replaced yet again.
6729872	6736376	I seem to remember something like this coming up a couple weeks ago about the whole Best Buy shenanigans, so they didn't put up too much of a fight in replacing it for you?
6738171	6738451	Wow.
6763895	6791054	so the guy says he had some Geek Squad blow it out with compressed air which is something I already did he says take it home if it works it works if not bring it back and exchange it so I now have an Elite sitting on my counter how does blowing out a console fix a DVD drive well it works on Nintendo I don't know you tell me wow alright well I guess there you go they finally got you one though right
6791653	6794375	Yeah, I had to swap out the hard drive.
6794436	6800581	I'm sitting there like, well, I could take the 120 gig hard drive, come home with it, and my roommate would kill me because of all the saves.
6800701	6803083	Or I could just take the 60 gig, which I did.
6805145	6806626	What else is going on in your gaming world, Ranma?
6807807	6808268	Not too much.
6808308	6814553	I started back into playing Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass because I forgot where I left off at, so I'm starting from scratch.
6815995	6817296	Well, sometimes that's what you got to do.
6817316	6818317	You got to start all over.
6819302	6820042	Don't just hate that.
6820082	6823303	You pick up an RPG after you haven't played it for a long time.
6823323	6825024	You're like, where the hell was I?
6825344	6826764	Damn it, I have to start all over.
6826924	6828405	Yeah, I did that with Lost Odyssey.
6829245	6833186	I was on the second disc or something, and then I went back and played it again.
6833226	6836587	I got all the way to the third disc, and now it's been a few months since I played.
6836627	6838748	If I wanted to go back, I'd probably have to start from the beginning again.
6839088	6848711	I will say, though, what little I've played of Dragon Age Origins, I do like, though, that whenever on the loading screen of Dragon Age Origins, it gives you a one-paragraph summary of where you are in the story.
6849871	6852792	I thought that was a really smart feature, kind of remind you what's going on.
6853013	6853773	I thought that was pretty cool.
6855934	6858715	Well, Ranma, if there's nothing else on your mind, then I'll let you go so we can get some more calls.
6858735	6859955	But thanks so much for your call, okay, buddy?
6860555	6861856	I have one thing, and I'll be on my way.
6862076	6863757	I talked about Avatar earlier.
6863997	6872840	I want to let everyone know that a friend of mine, Kyle Hebert, who's a voice actor, he's doing the playable character, Ryuk, for Avatar the Game for the Wii.
6873833	6883959	maybe we'll have to get him on the show I know there's another voice actor we're trying to get on the show hopefully in the next couple weeks I will let him know and let's see what happens with it awesome take care buddy
6886471	6890796	877-GAME-OLR if you want to get through or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
6890836	6892799	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6893199	6894100	Toll-free in the U.S.
6894160	6903952	and Canada, but if you're in another country besides those two, I would really urge you to use Skype because it's free, whereas you get charged for using toll-free numbers in non-North America countries.
6905353	6906834	Do we have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?
6906874	6911699	Real quick, a few things on the Xbox 360 hacking scene.
6912059	6920246	The two newer light-on drives that were unhackable before are now able to be dumped through a new method that they've figured out.
6920847	6922529	And also they found out a way to...
6923601	6930563	Hack, Xbox Live Arcade Games, and now they can register any game that they have a demo for.
6930883	6932043	Thanks to Yaris!
6932783	6933863	Yaris made it possible.
6934263	6936064	So there was some good for that game after all.
6936184	6936744	Interesting.
6937564	6939485	So Yaris had some good come out of it after all.
6939505	6948547	Of course, it does require that you have a modded homebrew-enabled system, which requires a certain mod chip and a firmware prior to...
6949707	6951609	Beat Raiders coming to the iPhone, that's kind of neat, I guess.
6969540	6970961	Oh, that's the Timbaland game, right?
6971161	6971501	Yeah.
6972842	6976443	Did you hear he collaborated with Miley Cyrus on the new album?
6977003	6978344	That's an odd pairing, isn't it?
6978624	6980145	Timbaland and Miley Cyrus?
6980465	6980905	For real?
6981305	6983506	Well, she's trying to become more edgy, I guess.
6983526	6986988	I don't know if I can believe that, but all right.
6990286	6990887	Is that it?
6991007	6991527	That's all you got?
6991707	6993148	Yeah, that's all I got.
6993168	6996070	When all is said and done, it wasn't a super busy news week.
6996911	7002015	DarkSakura, I'm going to ask you if you have anything last minute, but usually you speak up if you do.
7004193	7005234	I'm not feeling well, Rob.
7005294	7005754	I'm sorry.
7006495	7007055	Sorry to hear that.
7007536	7008196	I hope you feel better.
7008436	7009177	I'm feeling lightheaded.
7009497	7009838	Oh, no.
7010358	7011719	Well, maybe you need to go lie down and take a nap.
7012380	7012620	Maybe.
7012840	7016924	Well, the good news is, then I suppose for you, is that the show is just about done here.
7016944	7020608	It doesn't look like we're getting any more calls, which there's a lot of shy chatters tonight.
7020628	7022389	We got some people going, should I call in?
7022429	7023030	I don't know.
7023050	7026033	And I'm like, well, call in if you have something to say, but the phone's not going off.
7026073	7027034	The good news is... What?
7028058	7031602	I ordered my pasta for you.
7032283	7033104	Is that for you and the wife?
7033525	7036088	It's for us and our guests.
7036128	7038611	We have a friend that just had their baby.
7038651	7039152	We'll back in.
7039921	7041142	I don't hate Utada's first US album.
7066121	7071007	I don't think it's like OMG greatest thing ever, but it's not bad as a piece of pop music.
7071067	7071527	It's fine.
7071807	7073970	I think it was underrated, I think, by a lot of people.
7074390	7078775	But yeah, if you're a fan of Timbaland, Utada's first US album, I'm looking forward to seeing her live.
7078955	7081018	That's going to be a rare opportunity in January.
7081118	7081678	So woohoo!
7082880	7084481	Anyhow, we're going to go around and wrap it up.
7084521	7087764	I know it's a little bit of a short show tonight, but it's been kind of a weird week.
7087904	7090767	Also, right before Christmas, not a lot going on.
7090807	7095511	People are just getting ready for the holidays and all that stuff, which actually already started with Hanukkah.
7095531	7097073	It kind of kicks off the holiday season.
7097573	7099214	Of course, you have all the other stuff.
7099234	7100516	It really goes on through New Year's
7100936	7101156	I'm tired.
7101176	7101977	Sorry to hear that.
7102017	7102097	Loki.
7121092	7122173	I can't wait to eat the pasta
7144713	7145513	That's my final thought.
7145553	7148134	Hail Godga, because it's the whole reason the show's getting screwed up tonight.
7148254	7149295	So, appreciate it.
7150575	7150995	That's it.
7151396	7153976	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
7153996	7154877	We really appreciate it.
7155137	7159799	You know, we do the show for free, and all we ask, if you enjoy what you've heard, tell a friend or two about the show.
7160059	7161059	Help us spread the word.
7161119	7162080	Word of mouth's all we got.
7162140	7164981	We don't have a big, big magazine or anything that backs us up.
7165341	7165881	It's just us.
7165941	7167422	We do accept donations.
7168042	7169622	We will be back, though, next year.
7169682	7171383	Donations of money and food.
7172583	7173224	Cookies are good.
7173284	7173744	Macroons.
7174386	7176129	I just gave Rob the last of my macaroons.
7176891	7177812	They were delicious, by the way.
7178293	7179195	Anyhow, that's going to do it.
7179255	7179956	Thank you guys so much.
7180597	7182721	We'll do it all again next week on the 19th.
7182941	7187329	So, until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're gone!
