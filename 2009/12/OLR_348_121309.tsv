0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.
14000	24000	Tonight, December 13th, 2009, a retro-tastic Mega Man 10 is announced, LittleBigPlanet is about to get Captain Sackboy, and what famous video game has been adapted for the stage?
24000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	41000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41000	53000	Of course, we tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, except this week. This week is kind of special. It's very special right now actually.
54000	64000	We're on take two of trying to tape live on Saturday. We're actually live the day before, and if you want to know why things are all kind of awkward this week, well, you can blame Lady Gaga. It's all Lady Gaga's fault.
64000	76000	No, I know people like to blame her for a lot of things, but I'm going to the concert in San Francisco tomorrow night, as mentioned a couple weeks back, and so it just works out because the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, is here.
77000	78000	Hi.
79000	80000	And I think she said something about a pinball party that she's going to.
81000	82000	It's Dan's turn to host the pinball party.
83000	84000	I see.
85000	89000	So we'll be probably running away from it tomorrow night to go probably watch Star Trek with Becky.
90000	91000	I see.
91000	93000	We'll have a special guest next week though.
94000	95000	So it just seems to work out. Really, we have a special guest next week? Who's that? Who dat?
96000	98000	I'm wondering if I should spoil the surprise.
99000	100000	Oh, okay.
101000	102000	We are going to have Tiara.
103000	104000	Really? Is she going to be here next week?
105000	106000	Yes.
107000	108000	I'm very excited.
109000	110000	So am I.
111000	112000	Awesome, awesome. Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
113000	114000	Hello.
115000	116000	How you doing, Loki?
117000	118000	Doing fine.
118000	121000	Our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, if you want to join us.
122000	124000	Now, we're going to get into our gaming weeks pretty soon here.
125000	130000	But before we do that, I want to ask Loki, what the heck is this thing that you brought with you to the studio tonight?
131000	135000	It looks like kind of like a Game Boy Advance, like one of the mini ones they release later on, but it's a little bit bigger actually.
136000	137000	No, it's cooler than Game Boy Micro.
138000	143000	It's a Dingo Digital A320, also I think called like a Game King or something like that.
144000	145000	Of course, made in China.
145000	150000	And what it is, is it's a device that only runs emulators.
151000	154000	Well, emulators and I guess different homebrew applications.
155000	156000	I think it's based off Linux.
157000	164000	But you can actually run, you know, different emulators including CPS 1 and 2, which are the Capcom arcade games.
165000	167000	MVS, which is the Neo Geo arcade games.
168000	171000	NES, I want to say Mega Drive.
171000	180000	I think Game Boy Advance, those are all the default emulators that are actually in the system itself, but you can load more stuff on later on.
181000	183000	I was going to say it doesn't look like an Australian canine.
184000	185000	It doesn't look like it ate a baby either.
186000	187000	It did not eat a baby.
188000	189000	You can also tune in radio on it.
190000	192000	Can you listen to Orange Lounge Radio?
193000	194000	You can listen to podcasts because it plays MP3.
195000	196000	And it has Linux?
197000	198000	I think it's based off Linux. I'm not positive.
198000	201000	Actually, no. It's not based off Linux. You can install Linux on it.
202000	203000	I'm sure someone's put Linux on it.
204000	207000	If they can install Linux on a freaking toaster oven, they can install Linux on that thing.
208000	209000	You can install Linux on it. It's actually not based on Linux.
210000	217000	I thought it may have been because I know that GP2X, it's another homebrew device, you can do that.
218000	219000	And it also outputs the TV, so that's kind of cool.
220000	221000	That's pretty cool. Now how much did one of those suckers cost you?
222000	222000	Eighty bucks.
223000	224000	Wow, that's not bad. And where did you get it from?
225000	225000	eBay.
226000	226000	Okay.
226000	227000	Who makes them?
228000	230000	I don't remember the company's name.
231000	234000	Does it come from another country? Surely the legality of those things is questionable.
235000	238000	Well, there you go. All the good piracy stuff comes from China.
239000	245000	It's kind of cool though. It charges via USB. It takes mini SD cards, so I actually don't have a card for it.
246000	249000	But it has four gigs of internal memory you can store crap to, so that's kind of cool.
250000	253000	And you can put themes on it. In fact, I have a Legend of Zelda theme on mine.
253000	257000	Which, it's hard to see, Rob, but you'll have to take a look at it.
258000	260000	Alright, I'm looking at the, this is great radio, by the way.
261000	264000	Oh, okay. It kind of has like a crossbar thing going on, like a PSP.
265000	266000	Yeah, it's got like a crossbar thing going on there.
267000	269000	That's cool. I like that. That's pretty neat.
270000	272000	And Jamie is super gluing her fingers together, apparently.
273000	274000	What the hell is she doing over there? Is she doing arts and crafts during the show?
275000	277000	Like, I know last week she was crocheting. Now she's gluing.
277000	283000	Oh, and I forgot. The other thing you can do, it has a built-in microphone, so you can actually do dictation or whatever, record yourself.
284000	286000	That's kind of interesting. Alright, well.
287000	288000	There you go.
289000	292000	Hey guys, if you are listening to us live on this Saturday, you can join us in our chat room.
293000	295000	chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
296000	300000	Or if you're on the Game Surge Network on IRC, you just want to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
301000	303000	All one word, and that is our chat room.
304000	305000	We do use a different room than the all-games chatters.
305000	309000	I don't know why, we just always have. It's a history thing at this point.
310000	311000	Kind of tradition, I guess you could say.
312000	314000	Anyhow, we are going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week, somewhat shortly here.
315000	321000	If you're listening to us on Sunday, sorry that you're not able to interact with us live this week, but we will be back on Sunday the 19th.
322000	326000	That should be an interesting show, by the way, because I'm going to be running back from Disneyland that morning.
327000	329000	So I'm going to run right in here.
330000	332000	I'm going to need you to do the show next week, Loki. Just so you know.
332000	334000	Alright, super. Alright, anyhow.
335000	337000	Now that we're taking care of business live on air, let's get into our gaming weeks.
338000	341000	And if DarkSakura has unglued her fingers, I'm going to ask her how her gaming week was.
342000	344000	No, I've got glue all over my fingers still. I was fixing, my cell phone case broke.
345000	353000	And the little thing that clips it to my belt snapped off, so I just super glued it back on.
354000	356000	Because rubber cement clearly isn't working.
356000	361000	And now I've just super glued my fingers, so I'm going to have to go run and use some nail polish remover on them.
362000	363000	What about gaming?
364000	365000	I glued soap to my fingers.
366000	368000	Apparently she's too busy gluing her fingers together to play games.
369000	373000	So I played some World of Warcraft yesterday for like an hour.
374000	375000	You've got to level 10 now, huh?
376000	379000	I have a second character at 10 now. I have a character at 15.
380000	381000	Moving on up.
381000	385000	My goat girl.
386000	387000	She's a mage.
388000	391000	So now you get to spend talent points at 15. So are you fire, frost, or arcane?
392000	394000	No idea. Probably going to be fire because I like burning shit.
395000	396000	Yeah, fire's fun.
397000	401000	I'm also playing a hunter every so often. I play with Tiara.
402000	407000	And then I'm actually playing on another server just because people ask me to.
407000	411000	I'm playing a dark elf druid.
412000	414000	Dark elf? When did I say dark elf? It's not fucking D&D.
415000	416000	No, night elf.
417000	419000	It's okay. WoW ripped a lot off from D&D, so it works.
420000	421000	Now I'm going to go pour acetone on my fingers.
422000	423000	Alright, have fun.
424000	425000	Loki, how was your gaming week besides the dingo?
426000	429000	Besides the dingo? I actually played on my arcade cabinet a little bit because I finally got...
430000	433000	It's almost done. The front end's working now.
433000	440000	The problem is I have too many games listed on there because I have every single game that's been pretty much ever put on MAME on that cabinet.
441000	447000	It makes it really hard to find stuff, so I have to go back now and remove stuff off the list that I don't really want to play.
448000	450000	And that's going to be a process in itself.
451000	452000	Yeah, fun.
453000	457000	But I did play a little bit of... What did I play on there? I was testing it out.
458000	461000	Oh, just some random Neo Geo games and stuff. It works really well.
461000	470000	And then I've been playing Bayonetta. I finally broke out my Japanese 360 and that game is all sorts of awesome.
471000	478000	Totally reiterating what Rob said last week about the game. It's so over the top. Every single bit is over the top.
479000	487000	One of the main characters in the game gives Bayonetta some new guns because in the very beginning it's just these stupid little pistols or whatever.
487000	495000	But I love it because it's not quality, it's quantity and he starts throwing tons of pistols at her and it's just absolutely ridiculous.
496000	497000	Wait, is it dubbed in English?
498000	499000	It's all in English. The entire game is in English.
500000	507000	So you didn't play... I just played the demo, which was a selected stage from the game apparently, but you actually have the full Japanese one.
508000	510000	Yeah, I have the full game. It's absolutely all in English.
510000	515000	So it's just ridiculous.
516000	520000	Have you done the trick where she gets on the ground and starts shooting people with her feet with the guns in her heels?
521000	522000	Yeah.
523000	528000	You can do that or like the one where it zooms around her really fast and stuff, shooting different things. That's crazy.
529000	535000	But they also have these mini games or whatever. You earn these coins or whatever and they have a shooting gallery mini game that you earn items and stuff.
535000	541000	It's in between levels. I love the Joe Pesci type character. It's Joe Pesci but not Joe Pesci.
542000	544000	My favorite character in the game.
545000	552000	Just everything about the game is so over the top though. Seriously, it gives her new red pistols or whatever that are in the game.
552000	565000	And there's this sequence where the guy's mixing a drink and she's putting on the pistols in the most ridiculous over the top choreographed scene I've ever seen.
566000	569000	It's just really out there, but it's awesome.
570000	574000	This is definitely my most anticipated game of 2010, no question. This is going to be amazing.
575000	577000	I kind of want to come over and play the one that you have.
577000	584000	It wasn't even really on my radar, but man, after picking up and playing it, and I hate Devil May Cry. I hate it.
585000	587000	But this game is awesome.
588000	593000	This is totally one of those games I never thought I would like. Just looking at screenshots where you don't really see the game in motion.
594000	603000	I have a proposal for you then. Sometime in the next weeks or so, you should totally just bring it over and the three of us should just play through it.
604000	605000	Maybe tape it or something.
605000	606000	I have it in my car.
607000	608000	Do you really?
609000	616000	Yeah, I have it in my car. In fact, I have to order Pizza Hut pasta after the show, and since we're going to be wrapped up sooner than I thought.
617000	619000	We have to be done before 5 Pacific because I think the next All Games program is at 5.
620000	624000	So since we're going to be done before what I thought, we might have a chance to play it for a few minutes.
625000	629000	Hey, hey, alright. Might be something we do after the show. Too bad I don't have my video camera. Oh well, we'll figure something out.
629000	637000	That's alright. I'm trying to think of what else I play this week also. Still no Borderlands yet, but I'm hoping to break into that tomorrow night.
638000	644000	Unfortunately I got distracted by Bayonetta. And then of course more Grand Theft Auto because that's what we play every day.
644000	661000	It's really sad though, there's not a lot of people online playing Grand Theft Auto, at least not the Ballad of the Gay Tony multiplayer, man. There's times where we'll be playing ranked matches where we can't get more than 4 people in, and those 4 people are us.
662000	669000	It's so slow that we can get into the same ranked game easy now, but I don't know.
669000	674000	Talk to Dan at some point, because while he's off work I'm sure he'll play with you guys.
675000	686000	Sure. Alright, moving into my gaming week then. Not a whole lot of new stuff. I'm also trying to think of anything new I played this week and I'm drawing a blank, but just celebrating some old stuff.
687000	694000	In fact, one big thing I did this week that I will talk about is that you might have heard around the internet that there was a big fundraiser for Child's Play in the Bay Area.
694000	702000	In fact, we had SEG, one of the organizers on the show a couple weeks ago, UMLOUD, happen this Wednesday, and I actually trekked out over to the Bay Area to check it out.
703000	710000	It was cool. It was a fun little event. It wasn't super crowded, but it definitely wasn't a bad turnout.
711000	717000	It was tolerable, the amount of people in what is a much smaller club than you'd probably think if you're looking at some of those videos online of some of the bands.
717000	725000	Of course, the whole catch was that people would pay money to get up on stage and play rock band in a karaoke bar gone wild thing.
726000	733000	They had fog machines, professional lighting, and everything. They went out. They treated this like it was a normal concert for these bands that paid.
734000	742000	I think the ultimate band was $120 to get on stage, but it's a great, great charity, so it's kind of hard to say no to something like that.
742000	747000	In fact, I wanted to do it. I just didn't have, with Jamie and Loki not being able to go, I just didn't have enough people to do the band.
748000	750000	I completely forgot about it until I saw the tweet on it.
751000	752000	That was today, wasn't it?
753000	755000	That's alright. We still wouldn't have had enough people.
756000	760000	Some of the bands just really went all out, and you probably saw some of the pictures around the internet.
761000	766000	There was one band that had this chick dressed in blue that was wearing this outfit that was really over the top and awesome.
766000	772000	They had a band come out that was dressed up like Lego rock band. They actually had yellow buckets on their heads, and they put the little thingies.
773000	777000	You know how Lego has that little nub on the top of it? They actually had those as buckets and sang.
778000	780000	There's all these videos around the internet, and it was great.
781000	786000	I had a good time. I ran into some friends I haven't seen in a long time. A couple of my friends from high school were randomly there.
787000	793000	People from the DDR scene years ago that used to come on this program years and years ago, and we were exclusively about music games.
793000	800000	Like Wendell and Islander and some of these people that were big into freestyle and Perfect Attack and stuff were there, randomly.
801000	807000	Wendell had a band with his, I think it was his sister or niece and her friends or something. It was fun.
808000	809000	I think it was easy to do freestyle with them, too.
810000	811000	Yeah, it was cool.
812000	819000	They didn't have a lot set up as far as games because you just had the stage, which you had to pay to be on.
819000	822000	Or in the back, they had Beatles Rock Band, which actually had the new content.
823000	829000	But they had a lot of support from Harmonix. They had tons and tons of just loot.
830000	836000	You pay $10 to get in the door, which technically you don't have to do because it's a $10 suggested donation.
837000	840000	But since the whole thing is charity, if you don't pay $10, you're kind of a douche.
841000	843000	Unless you're a starving student or whatever, you know, the economy.
844000	846000	Then you don't need to go outside and you need to be studying.
846000	851000	But, you know, obviously I'm sure everybody paid their fair share, if not more, to get in.
852000	853000	And it all worked out to about $10 a person.
854000	855000	They actually gave you a little ticket.
856000	859000	Well, they gave you raffle tickets, which sadly we weren't able to stay long enough to get all the raffles.
860000	862000	So I don't know if we ever would have won the raffles. I don't think so.
863000	864000	But you also got a ticket to go to a loot table.
865000	866000	And it's like you got one free gift.
867000	871000	And they had all sorts of just random shit on these loot tables.
871000	879000	Like PlayStation 1 games, Super Nintendo games I saw on there, like a calendar for Bayonetta I was looking at.
880000	886000	Like a lot of those promo type things you would see at E3, like the types of E3 swag, all like dumped out on the table.
887000	891000	So I walked out of there with a plug and play Intellivision Part 2.
892000	893000	It's a little controller.
894000	898000	The second one they've released apparently with 10 Intellivision games I guarantee you've never heard of.
898000	900000	Well, except Jamie because she's crazy.
901000	902000	Yeah, I know.
903000	904000	But I walked out of there with that.
905000	909000	My friend who I went with, Alan, he walked out of there with a copy of Advance Force 2 for Game Boy Advance.
910000	913000	So just all this cool stuff on the loot table, it was kind of rad.
914000	915000	It was all donated to a great cause.
916000	922000	And then they had a silent auction going on, which I know they gave away a very limited edition,
922000	929000	signed like a Space Invaders thing of which I think only 180 exist.
930000	933000	I think that thing went for like several thousand dollars.
934000	935000	They gave away like a stuffed thing from Lost Planet.
936000	938000	I won one of the silent auctions.
939000	942000	I don't want to talk about it on the show because part of it's going to be a Christmas present for someone
943000	946000	and even though I don't think they listen, I just don't want to talk about it on the show.
947000	950000	And if you figure it out, please don't spread word out because it's somebody's Christmas present.
950000	952000	But I did win one of the auctions.
953000	954000	And you know what's funny?
955000	959000	Have you ever had the experience of reading on the internet on a forum,
960000	962000	like someone talking smack about you when they didn't know who you were?
963000	964000	Have you ever had that happen?
965000	967000	Like you read this story and someone's talking smack about a person they saw somewhere and it was you?
968000	969000	All the time.
970000	971000	Like I had that happen, okay?
972000	976000	And it's funny because Dark Tetsuya on our Twitter linked me to this story on Kotaku about Um Loud and kind of a wrap up.
976000	980000	And in the comments, get this, this guy named S.H. Dragon left a comment.
981000	982000	Other fun things.
983000	987000	I lost the blank auction because the guy I was bid warring against was camping the clipboard.
988000	990000	Boo. I can't believe that went for only $100.
991000	992000	Oh well, I didn't really have the money to spend anyway.
993000	994000	It's just kind of funny.
995000	996000	First off, I wasn't camping the clipboard.
997000	999000	We just happened to be sitting in that back corner right by where the silent auction was,
1000000	1001000	me and Alan and a couple of guys.
1001000	1007000	But I will admit, yeah, I was going to go up there at 1029 and make sure I was the highest bidder come 1030, of course.
1008000	1009000	Call it what you will.
1010000	1012000	It just means that you didn't really want it as badly as...
1013000	1014000	Yes, that's right, that's right.
1015000	1016000	It just means dude didn't want it as bad as I did.
1017000	1020000	And it worked out and actually I got it for $90, not $100.
1021000	1022000	And really it was a steal.
1023000	1027000	It was absolutely a steal and it should have gone for much more, especially for such a good cause.
1027000	1030000	However, $100 was about the most I was going to spend on this.
1031000	1034000	Because even though it's for a good cause, look, I got to live too and got money and everything.
1035000	1038000	So that was probably about the most I was going to bid on it.
1039000	1041000	And I'm in turn giving half of it to somebody else.
1042000	1045000	And I'll explain more about what that is after it gets given to the individual.
1046000	1048000	So yeah, that was my experience at UmLoud.
1049000	1050000	Overall, very good.
1051000	1052000	I wish I could have stayed for more of it.
1053000	1054000	I wish I could have got up on stage.
1054000	1056000	Next year. I have heard it is confirmed again for next year.
1057000	1058000	I'm not sure if it's the same venue or what have you.
1059000	1063000	But honestly, if you guys haven't already or didn't go this year,
1064000	1065000	and I didn't really run into a lot of OLR listeners,
1066000	1068000	definitely make plans to go next year because it was quite a bit of fun.
1069000	1070000	That's pretty much it for my gaming week.
1071000	1073000	I didn't play a whole lot of video games I haven't talked about on the show before otherwise.
1074000	1076000	DJ Hero, I played some more of this week.
1077000	1078000	I played that track pack, the David Guetta track pack.
1079000	1080000	I haven't played that yet. I downloaded it.
1080000	1084000	Sexy Bitch, or no, it's Sexy Chick, I think they renamed it.
1085000	1088000	And When Love Takes Over, which is weird because that's download pack.
1089000	1092000	The songs aren't mixed. It's just the one song, but they're like remixes of the song.
1093000	1097000	I'm sure that are available on a remix CD somewhere, I'm sure, or vinyl.
1098000	1101000	But it was cool. One of them has a crap ton of crossfading in it.
1102000	1103000	And I have to admit, I actually kind of like the songs.
1104000	1106000	So even though one of them had Dudes for the Black Eyed Peas,
1107000	1108000	which usually is one of those bands you're like,
1108000	1109000	they're so played out.
1110000	1115000	If I hear that goddamn song at the club one more time, I gotta feel it.
1116000	1119000	Like, oh my god, if I hear that at the club one more time, I'm gonna poke my eye out.
1120000	1121000	But I gotta admit, that one song is pretty cool.
1122000	1123000	Do it on camera so we can put it on YouTube.
1124000	1125000	Yeah, fine.
1126000	1128000	Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1129000	1132000	Again, we're pre-taping. If you're just joining us on All Games Radio on Saturday,
1133000	1135000	that's because we're pre-taping, or pre-recording, whatever you want to call it.
1135000	1138000	We're doing a pre-thing for our Sunday, the 13th.
1139000	1140000	This will rebroadcast again on Sunday.
1141000	1142000	If you're listening live on Sunday, sorry we are not live,
1143000	1145000	but we do hope you'll send us an email or a tweet or something
1146000	1148000	to tell us what you thought about tonight's show.
1149000	1151000	And of course, the podcasters, well, you're used to getting this on the feed anyway.
1152000	1156000	Also, join our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio,
1157000	1158000	or our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
1159000	1161000	We always post little updates, especially if there is gonna be weird things
1161000	1164000	like pre-recorded shows and all that stuff going on.
1165000	1166000	All right, gaming news.
1167000	1169000	Believe it or not, even though we're only a couple weeks out before Christmas,
1170000	1172000	there's been quite a little bit of it, so let's get into some gaming news.
1173000	1176000	Oh, Loki. Loki wants to do this during housekeeping tonight.
1177000	1177000	Just real quick.
1178000	1180000	All right, Loki has brought Christmas presents, or Hanukkah presents,
1181000	1183000	I suppose, if you will, at an appropriate time.
1184000	1186000	I had to bring him over because the cat was starting to eye him up
1187000	1189000	because she likes ribbons and paper and stuff,
1189000	1190000	and she'll start ripping into it.
1191000	1193000	And don't I feel like a douchebag because Loki's brought this so early
1194000	1195000	and I don't have his present here.
1196000	1197000	I don't do my shopping until Christmas Eve.
1198000	1199000	I do my shopping all this week.
1200000	1202000	I do my shopping afterwards so I get it all on sale.
1203000	1206000	Ladies first, Dark Sakura, you can open your gift.
1207000	1208000	This is great radio.
1209000	1210000	Surely the wife must have done this.
1211000	1212000	The wife did the wrapping.
1213000	1215000	There's no way Loki did this wrapping himself.
1216000	1217000	I did no wrapping of that.
1217000	1219000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradi.com,
1220000	1223000	ToaGak says, if you ever lose an episode of OLR,
1224000	1225000	I'm archiving the live editions for you.
1226000	1227000	What did you get?
1228000	1230000	Return to Labyrinth manga. That's awesome.
1231000	1231000	Sweet.
1232000	1233000	Oh my god, that's super cool.
1234000	1234000	I'm gonna read the hell out of this.
1235000	1235000	That's great.
1236000	1237000	And dude, it's like...
1238000	1239000	You gotta open the big one first.
1240000	1241000	I gotta open the big one first before the little one.
1242000	1243000	Okay, you got it. So I'm gonna open the big one first.
1243000	1246000	This is a big...
1247000	1248000	What a big package you have, Loki.
1249000	1250000	That's your package, Rob.
1251000	1252000	Oh, sorry. Well, you gave me your package.
1253000	1255000	FC... Oh my god.
1256000	1257000	Oh, what a cool...
1258000	1259000	Oh my god, rad!
1260000	1262000	Dude, it's an FC Mobile.
1264000	1265000	Yes!
1266000	1268000	Oh, Loki, you're the best. That's awesome.
1269000	1271000	Look at that. It's like a portable Nintendo.
1271000	1272000	Those are fun.
1273000	1274000	You have one of these too, right?
1275000	1275000	Yes, I do.
1276000	1277000	Oh my god, awesome.
1278000	1279000	You can plug it into your TV and the light gun's a wireless light gun.
1280000	1282000	Yeah, the controllers are wireless and the light gun's wireless.
1283000	1284000	Holy fucking crap, I'm so excited.
1285000	1286000	Dude, I'm gonna play this right away.
1287000	1288000	Oh my god, this must be a game over here in the gold.
1289000	1290000	And I got you batteries.
1291000	1292000	Oh, sweet, okay. Cool, cool.
1293000	1294000	I didn't wrap the batteries.
1295000	1296000	I can only guess what game this is.
1296000	1300000	I bet you could.
1301000	1303000	Fuck yeah, Guardian Legend, motherfucker!
1304000	1305000	There you go, batteries.
1306000	1307000	Oh my god, awesome.
1308000	1309000	Hold on, this is great right here.
1310000	1311000	Awesome, Loki, you're the best.
1312000	1313000	Take the Guardian Legends wherever you go.
1314000	1315000	Darkstalkers gonna put these on the website or on the Twitter?
1316000	1317000	On the website.
1318000	1319000	Batteries fell, but here you go.
1320000	1321000	Taking a picture live there.
1322000	1324000	There's my FC Mobile and copy of Guardian Legend.
1324000	1325000	Did you get that?
1326000	1326000	Yep.
1327000	1328000	Alright, cool. Very cool.
1329000	1330000	I'm taking a picture of my mom.
1331000	1332000	Kitsune's asking, where's our presents?
1333000	1334000	Dude, I'm not that rich.
1335000	1336000	I can't buy everybody gifts.
1337000	1338000	We've been taping this show for free for the past seven years.
1339000	1340000	We don't run ads or nothing.
1341000	1343000	I didn't even know these came out, so this is like super cool.
1344000	1345000	That's awesome.
1346000	1347000	I don't even know how I found those.
1348000	1349000	I don't even remember what I was looking for,
1350000	1351000	but I somehow came across them like, hey.
1351000	1354000	No, yeah. Oh my god, if I had found those, I would have bought a fort too.
1355000	1356000	You remember what the movie's called?
1357000	1359000	It's, you know, Labyrinth guest star David Bowie's package.
1360000	1362000	And I'm sorry, this is prettier than David Bowie has ever been,
1363000	1364000	and David Bowie is pretty.
1365000	1367000	Alright. Well, now that I'm in a super duper happy mood,
1368000	1371000	part of me wants to turn this on during the break or something.
1372000	1373000	I want to get this up and going.
1374000	1375000	Dude, FC Mobile, yeah.
1376000	1377000	I'm gonna go out and buy NES games like crazy.
1377000	1381000	Anyhow, now, this, I can support portable gaming with this.
1382000	1383000	Do you really?
1384000	1385000	I can support portable games with this.
1386000	1387000	The hell with the DS and the PSP.
1388000	1389000	I got an FC Mobile, y'all.
1390000	1391000	Alright, getting into some gaming news tonight.
1392000	1393000	Loki, start us off.
1394000	1396000	So you may remember that a little bit ago, no doubt,
1397000	1400000	and I believe Courtney Love tried suing Activision for the likenesses
1400000	1406000	of Kurt Cobain and, of course, No Doubt in Band Hero more recently.
1407000	1414000	However, Activision has responded to No Doubt's claim by counter-suing them.
1415000	1418000	Basically, they're made in responses that the band requests
1419000	1424000	that their likenesses be limited to performing only the band's own songs in game
1424000	1430000	was made, however, it was requested only after the band hero programming was finalized.
1431000	1437000	Activision is basically seeking an unspecified amount for damages and interest from the band,
1438000	1442000	as well as court and attorney fees and return of all payment dispersed to the band for their involvement.
1443000	1447000	So basically, they want their money back for their involvement in the game.
1447000	1453000	This is a gigantic bitch-slap to one of the biggest bands of the last few years.
1454000	1458000	For me, I think this is kind of retarded that Activision is doing.
1459000	1461000	I mean, I understand that they had an agreement in place,
1462000	1465000	and apparently somebody didn't read the contract close enough or whatever,
1466000	1470000	and so they want their money back, or they want the patch to this game,
1471000	1475000	but they can't, at least they can on Wii and PlayStation 2 and that kind of stuff.
1475000	1484000	But at the same time, now I'm wondering if this is going to prevent them from having other bands in the game going forward.
1485000	1486000	I have a theory about this.
1487000	1489000	I think that the logic behind this would be,
1490000	1494000	well, we counter-sue you to where if we've got to make all this content change,
1495000	1497000	then we want our money back, blah, blah, blah.
1498000	1502000	I think it's actually going to end up in some kind of closed-doors deal.
1502000	1505000	I'm sure it will, but they can't make the content change.
1506000	1508000	I mean, you can't just, and I've seen this going around on Twitter,
1509000	1510000	is that why don't they just patch it in?
1511000	1512000	Well, you can't patch to the Wii.
1513000	1515000	They have no system of patching on the Wii, and you can't patch to the PS2.
1516000	1518000	So you would have games, the damage is done, period.
1519000	1520000	You can't go back and fix it.
1521000	1523000	And you would have people complaining, hey, you're removing content from the game.
1524000	1525000	What the hell?
1525000	1531000	Well, maybe I want, no doubt, to sing some stupid song, because it's funny, and I enjoy that.
1532000	1534000	And you're removing that ability for a game that I paid for.
1535000	1539000	To me, the counter-suit just seems like a, we fucking mean it, kind of thing.
1540000	1541000	Like, you guys are wrong, and we fucking mean it.
1542000	1544000	To me, this seems like they want to recoup their legal fees.
1545000	1548000	That's it. I don't think they honestly would expect to win the whole thing,
1549000	1553000	but I would think it's just legal fees that they see this as a, quote, unquote, frivolous lawsuit.
1553000	1556000	And I do see them winning this, actually, because the reason why is,
1557000	1562000	if they have them sign to a contract that agrees, you know, that their likenesses can be used in this fashion,
1563000	1564000	there's not really much they can do.
1565000	1568000	They can bitch and moan about it, saying, well, I didn't realize it was going to be this.
1569000	1571000	Well, maybe you should have fucking read the contract closer then.
1572000	1573000	You know, same with the whole Kurt Cobain thing.
1574000	1579000	Yeah, it's tragic, but maybe you shouldn't have, I don't know, first off, licensed his, you know, likeness to be in the game,
1580000	1581000	and maybe you should have read your contract.
1581000	1584000	Well, my thought is, though, maybe they were shady about it,
1585000	1589000	and that's the only way I could see, no doubt, winning this thing, hands down,
1590000	1594000	is that if they were shady, like if they were able to prove that Activision kind of lied to them about it,
1595000	1598000	like, you know, and I think when this topic first came up with the Courtney Love thing a few months ago,
1599000	1602000	where it kind of started this whole thing, I think I kind of said this then,
1603000	1606000	and that is that, you know, when they showed this to Courtney Love,
1606000	1610000	or when they showed this to No Doubt, they probably didn't show them all this other stuff,
1611000	1612000	because of course they're not going to like that.
1613000	1616000	They wanted to show people having a good time, no doubt, singing No Doubt songs.
1617000	1620000	You're not going to win No Doubt over by showing them in the band playing Taylor Swift songs.
1621000	1623000	That's not going to be how you get them to sign on the dotted line,
1624000	1628000	and it's not like the band is going to take the time to sit down for four hours and play this game extensively.
1629000	1630000	Maybe that's the real problem before they sign on the dotted line.
1631000	1633000	Maybe somebody from their band should have played through the thing,
1633000	1639000	or kind of known what was going to happen based off of characters previously in Guitar Hero 3, right?
1640000	1641000	Because we had Slash and stuff in Guitar Hero 3.
1642000	1646000	I just think, I mean, you know, the only thing it's going to do is,
1647000	1650000	I think, hurt their chances now to have these people in their games next time.
1651000	1652000	That's true, yeah.
1653000	1655000	But the thing is, though, the majority of the artists in the game,
1656000	1659000	I mean, they're not the only ones that were in the game, aren't really bitching about it.
1659000	1662000	I mean, I don't think they really care.
1663000	1664000	It's only No Doubt.
1665000	1668000	I could, you know what, to be fair, I mean, I'm a fan of No Doubt.
1669000	1670000	Do I think they're overreacting? Yeah, a little bit.
1671000	1673000	But I gotta be honest, I would be a little pissed off, too,
1674000	1675000	if I didn't know that this was going to happen.
1676000	1679000	And if you had me in a video game singing a fucking Taylor Swift song,
1680000	1682000	oh my god, that bitch was like nails on a chalkboard to me.
1683000	1685000	I would not want to be associated with that, personally.
1685000	1688000	So I would be mad if I was an artist, you know, like that.
1689000	1690000	But at the same time, I would have to realize that,
1691000	1694000	oh, fuck, I should have maybe thought about that before I agreed to be in this video game.
1695000	1698000	But I think you're right, I think this is going to really screw their chances in the future
1699000	1701000	of being able to land some really big names, because, you know, No Doubt,
1702000	1705000	they got friends, so does Courtney Love, believe it or not.
1706000	1709000	She got friends, and, you know, bands are going to think twice.
1710000	1713000	And maybe they'll think twice, and they'll also realize that,
1713000	1717000	hey, you know, this is what's going to happen if you get involved with Activision.
1718000	1721000	You know, they'll see based on this, you know, if that's something they don't want,
1722000	1724000	then they won't get involved. Or they'll just, for the next one,
1725000	1727000	they'll just lock it so that these characters can only sing their songs or something like that.
1728000	1732000	Regardless of how this all goes down, I would really like to see it settled on Judge Judy, personally.
1733000	1735000	I would like to see Judge Judy settle this whole thing,
1736000	1740000	because, tell you what, if you ever watch that show, awesome.
1740000	1744000	And I'd like to just see her yell at the people from Activision,
1745000	1747000	Don't talk when I'm not talking to you!
1748000	1752000	Anyhow, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
1753000	1755000	Moving on to completely different news, and quickly.
1756000	1760000	Mega Man X has been announced. Mega Man X, I think a lot of us kind of saw this coming.
1761000	1762000	Mega Man 9 was obviously very well received.
1763000	1766000	So Mega Man X is coming out, not to be confused with Mega Man X.
1766000	1773000	So this is actually Mega Man X, not a roman numeral or anything, or a completely different series as X was.
1774000	1776000	Mega Man X is on its way, and it's coming out for WiiWare.
1777000	1778000	At least that's all that's announced right now.
1779000	1782000	But I wouldn't take that to mean that it's not coming out for 360 and PS3,
1783000	1785000	because Capcom likes to multi-platform their stuff.
1786000	1789000	But Nintendo Power is getting the first announcement on this.
1790000	1792000	Of course they're not going to tell you it's available on 360 and PS3.
1792000	1795000	Wait, didn't it come out on WiiWare first before with 9?
1796000	1798000	Or was that when there was a slight delay or something like that?
1799000	1801000	It's probably going to be on all platforms.
1802000	1803000	It was probably like a weak delay or something like that.
1804000	1805000	It'll be on all platforms.
1806000	1809000	So Mega Man X has been announced. It's coming out. It's retro-tastic again.
1810000	1811000	The whole NES style.
1812000	1813000	And one of the new bosses has been announced.
1814000	1815000	Sheep Man!
1816000	1819000	Yes, I'm not joking. Sheep Man. There's even some artwork out there.
1819000	1822000	It just looks kind of funny.
1825000	1828000	Anyhow, also there's supposed to be Proto Man as a playable character again.
1829000	1831000	And there will be a third mystery character.
1832000	1833000	It better be Forte.
1834000	1837000	It could be a variety of things. It could be Roll. Who knows?
1838000	1840000	Maybe it's Dr. Wily in a strange twist.
1841000	1843000	Because apparently Dr. Wily is not the villain this time.
1844000	1846000	Although, come on. Dr. Wily is always the villain at the end of the day.
1846000	1848000	It was Dr. Cossack, though.
1849000	1853000	Did you notice in that little screenshot there that they have the dragon shooting guns out of its nipples?
1854000	1855000	Which is kind of disturbing.
1856000	1857000	Ew, that is a little strange.
1858000	1861000	Well, that's just the awkward artwork that Capcom has learned to embrace.
1862000	1863000	They're terrible, terrible box art for Mega Man 1 and 2.
1864000	1866000	There will be dragons with nipple guns. I see it now.
1867000	1868000	Nipple Man!
1869000	1872000	That would... It should be Nipple Woman.
1872000	1877000	Sadly, I don't see that happening. I think this is supposed to be a friendly family game going on.
1878000	1879000	But, Sheep Man, that's...
1880000	1881000	If we have Sheep Man, we should have Cock Man.
1882000	1883000	What would be Sheep Man's weapon?
1884000	1888000	Like, a wooly gun? I don't know what it is.
1889000	1890000	A sleep gun.
1891000	1893000	Allergies! The allergy blaster.
1894000	1894000	The allergy blaster.
1895000	1896000	Like, he shoots at Mega Man and Mega Man gets a rash.
1897000	1899000	Also supposed to be in the game an easy mode.
1899000	1902000	Which, for those folks that were struggling a little bit in Mega Man 9,
1903000	1905000	I'm sure an easy mode will be welcomed for the game.
1906000	1907000	Including me, I'm sorry.
1908000	1910000	Mega Man 9, I think I got past like three bosses and that's as far as I could get.
1911000	1912000	So, yeah.
1913000	1916000	I would like to see Mega Man a little bit easier.
1917000	1918000	Just a little bit for us wussies.
1919000	1920000	Mega Man 2 kind of had an easy mode.
1921000	1922000	Or as it was called in America, normal mode.
1924000	1925000	Anyhow.
1926000	1927000	Dark Sakura, what do you got for us tonight?
1927000	1931000	Well, it's a particular, actually, it's a bit of fine culture, Rob.
1932000	1933000	A bit of fine culture.
1934000	1935000	It's a stage production, actually.
1936000	1937000	Oh, awesome.
1938000	1939000	So, culture.
1940000	1941000	Is it like the fabulous news I found out last night that Sister Act, the movie,
1942000	1943000	is being adapted for Broadway next year?
1944000	1945000	I thought it had already been done.
1946000	1947000	It had been done. It's in London right now.
1948000	1949000	And it's going to be on Broadway next year.
1950000	1951000	They did Xanadu.
1952000	1953000	I know. It did pretty well, actually.
1954000	1955000	I think it finally closed, but it did very well.
1955000	1958000	Well, this is about another fine stage production,
1959000	1961000	but actually it's being done in Sweden.
1962000	1964000	It's a Silent Hill stage production.
1965000	1966000	Okay.
1967000	1972000	So, imagine you step out onto the, you know, the curtain pulls back,
1973000	1977000	and you see a man wandering around wearing a car suit,
1978000	1981000	swerving off the road, and then getting out of the car suit to go chase
1981000	1984000	a 30-year-old dressed as a 5-year-old girl.
1985000	1987000	And the production takes like 50 fog machines.
1988000	1989000	Yeah, 50 fog machines.
1990000	1991000	So, but yeah, really.
1992000	1993000	But they're going to be posting the whole play on YouTube.
1994000	1995000	Nice.
1996000	1997000	So, keep an eye out for that.
1998000	1999000	It's done by a bunch of fans.
2000000	2001000	I would say that this play would get shut down immediately
2002000	2003000	for copyright infringement issues.
2004000	2005000	Oh, it's based on Silent Hill 2.
2006000	2007000	But, seeing as this is in another country,
2008000	2009000	I don't know if that's as easy to do.
2009000	2010000	Plus, I mean, I don't know.
2011000	2012000	If I were Konami, I'd be kind of flattered.
2013000	2014000	Like, I wouldn't want to shut it down.
2015000	2016000	I think if I were Konami, I'd be like,
2017000	2018000	oh shit, how are they going to pull this off?
2019000	2021000	One of my friends on LiveJournal, they did like a Star Wars play.
2022000	2023000	They did a play out of Star Wars, the movie,
2024000	2025000	and I think they were afraid they were going to get shut down.
2026000	2027000	But it turned out, like, Lucas embraced it,
2028000	2030000	and it ended up being, like, officially endorsed by them.
2031000	2032000	I have a theory about George Lucas, Rob.
2033000	2034000	What's that?
2035000	2036000	I think he really just likes pissing people off.
2036000	2038000	No, this is a good thing. It was impressive.
2039000	2040000	But I think that he likes doing the things that no one expects him to do.
2041000	2042000	I see.
2043000	2045000	Which is, you know, I was like, oh, so this is what you think happens to the story.
2046000	2047000	Well, I'm changing it!
2048000	2049000	And then I'm going to put in a character that annoys you all.
2050000	2051000	So this is who you thought shot first.
2052000	2053000	Well, you was wrong.
2054000	2056000	That's okay, Joss Whedon is my Lord and Master now.
2057000	2060000	Anyhow, Silent Hill the play, yes or no?
2061000	2063000	Well, I would love to watch it, except the whole thing is going to be in Swedish.
2063000	2068000	Which, you know what this means. We need Aki Ripper to go out and observe the play for us.
2069000	2071000	Aki Ripper, you are now our theater reviewer?
2072000	2074000	Congratulations, you just promoted to OLR.
2075000	2078000	He's not even listening right now, I'm sure, because we're on it at a completely different time.
2079000	2084000	But, you know, if you're listening on Sunday, Aki Ripper, you are now our official Broadway correspondent.
2085000	2086000	This counts for Swedish Broadway.
2087000	2089000	Rob, MXT, by the way, going back to the Mega Man story.
2089000	2094000	Oh yeah. So according to Wiki, so Sheep Man's weapon, according to Wikipedia, is thunder wool.
2095000	2097000	Thank you, chatters, chat.orangelaundry.com.
2098000	2099000	Thunder wool.
2100000	2101000	Was it just using static?
2102000	2104000	Do you just rub the wool against your body a whole lot and generate the static?
2105000	2106000	Aki Ripper isn't chat!
2107000	2108000	Is he? Oh!
2109000	2110000	You are now our theater correspondent.
2111000	2113000	Oh, Aki Ripper's here. Congratulations, Aki Ripper, you've been promoted. Now go see the Silent Hill play.
2114000	2115000	Thunder wool.
2115000	2120000	Thunder wool. It's probably playing on the complete other side of Sweden. It's like hours and hours away from where Aki Ripper's at.
2121000	2122000	Well, how long does it take to get across Sweden?
2123000	2126000	I don't know. By foot or by car or by plane.
2127000	2128000	It depends, I guess, which direction you're going to.
2129000	2133000	I'm going to be the ignorant American and say, Sweden's not that big. Come on.
2134000	2135000	Well, keep in mind...
2136000	2137000	I think it's about the size of California. I don't think it's much bigger than California.
2137000	2146000	Yeah, keep in mind, our states are technically little small countries. We just happen to be under one big federation.
2147000	2149000	Sort of like, I guess, the European Union without having to...
2150000	2151000	Or like Star Trek.
2152000	2158000	Yes, Rob. Someone linked me to a Star Trek menorah, by the way, that someone made out of action figures and LED lights.
2159000	2160000	Beautiful.
2161000	2164000	Aki Ripper says he's 14 hours away from where he is.
2164000	2166000	That's not that far. Get on a plane.
2167000	2168000	We'll send you gas money.
2169000	2170000	Get on a plane.
2171000	2172000	Loki, what do you have for us?
2173000	2174000	Wait, before you get there.
2175000	2180000	Fine, if Aki Ripper is going to boohoo about 14 hours away, even though he's closer than any of the rest of us,
2181000	2185000	then we need a Swede who's listening to the show who can go, who lives next door to this.
2186000	2191000	Maybe that was answering if it was 14 hours to get from one end of the country to the other.
2191000	2193000	Oh.
2194000	2195000	I don't know. I give up.
2196000	2197000	Or by sheep.
2198000	2199000	We'll just wait for the damn thing to get on YouTube.
2200000	2201000	It's like Dark Tetsuya said no, by sheep.
2202000	2203000	By Thunderwool Airlines.
2204000	2206000	Thunderwool! Thunderwool!
2207000	2208000	This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
2209000	2214000	Live at the Monster Truck Rally, see the big trucks take on Thunderwool!
2214000	2219000	Under 18, not emitted. Without parental consent.
2220000	2221000	Brain hurt. I need another cookie.
2222000	2223000	Loki, we need another story.
2224000	2225000	Aren't these cookies epic?
2226000	2227000	Those cookies are epic. They have little crushed candy canes in them.
2228000	2229000	They're Oreos, but with candy canes in them.
2230000	2233000	They're the Trader Joe's version of Oreos, but they're called Candy Cane Jojos.
2234000	2236000	Aw, and you thought we forgot Orange Lounge Fudio tonight, ladies and gentlemen.
2236000	2243000	So, remember that story that we talked about, the PSP Minis being playable on the PS3, how it was a rumor and everything?
2244000	2249000	Well, this week, update 3.15 came out, allowing you to play PSP Minis on your PS3.
2250000	2251000	So, hooray!
2252000	2260000	You know, if you were very envious of your PSP Minis, and you possibly didn't own a PSP, well, now you can play them on your PS3.
2260000	2270000	And the best part about that is, too, that one purchase of the PSP Mini obviously will allow you to play it both on the PS3 and on the PSP.
2271000	2279000	And you'll also be able to connect the two systems via LAN to transfer data from one system to the next.
2280000	2281000	So that's kind of neat.
2281000	2296000	Oh, that was the other add-on from 3.15. It'll allow you to transfer data. In case you bought a new PS3 system when they slimmed down a bit, you can actually transfer data from one to the other using an ethernet cable.
2297000	2300000	By the way, did you hear about that not all the games will work right away?
2301000	2308000	Because I was kind of excited about this. I was like, oh, cool! I really like the idea of something I can play on my PSP I can also play on the PS3.
2308000	2315000	You know, I kind of like that idea. Like the PS1 games, you can kind of already do that with, but I like the idea of newer games.
2316000	2322000	Of course, then when I looked at what Minis were available, I was kind of like, none of this sounds interesting to me without having seen the demo or anything.
2323000	2329000	But did you hear, most of them don't work right now. They're going to have to patch it in later, even though they did this big upgrade.
2329000	2341000	Well, here's what I want to know. If you're able to play these PSP Minis on your PS3, is that going to lead way to playing PSP games on your PS3?
2342000	2347000	And then we won't need the PSP anymore? You can just buy your game and play the systems?
2348000	2351000	I would like that. I don't know if that's something they would do.
2352000	2353000	They could.
2353000	2363000	I guess they could. Oh man, could you imagine the game library, how much that would expand? Actually, there are a lot of things on PSP I would be very excited to play on my television, but of course that's why they have video out.
2364000	2376000	Well, can you imagine? That would be a good selling point for the PSP Go, I would think. If you had, you know, you could download it on your PSP Go and transfer it to your PS3 and play it both places or whatever and take it on the road with you or something.
2376000	2383000	I don't know, but it'd be a good idea. It's the next step to getting to the PlayStation 2 on the PS3.
2384000	2396000	I don't know, chatters, what do you think? chat.orangelandsradio.com, do you think that having PSP games playable on the PS3 is a good idea for Sony, if it was technically possible? Let's assume that it's technically possible.
2396000	2406000	I don't know, do you remember the early, early rumors of the PlayStation 3 and some of the trademarks actually showed a UMD drive on the PS3? Do you remember that?
2407000	2415000	I remember that vaguely, years and years ago, before this thing came out. Some of the early trademarks, I think we reported on the show, had a UMD drive in it.
2416000	2418000	So maybe this is something they were thinking of at one time.
2419000	2420000	Maybe.
2421000	2422000	Maybe neat.
2422000	2429000	Alright, well one game that isn't on the PS3, well it is on the PS3, but the PS3 game is amazing, is LittleBigPlanet.
2430000	2439000	This game has kind of gotten coverage a lot in the past few weeks on our show, which is amazing for a game that's been out a year, again continuing to be supported.
2440000	2448000	One way that is continuing is through an alliance with Disney for Pirates of the Caribbean content to be added to LittleBigPlanet.
2448000	2454000	LittleBigPlanet, that's right, you will soon get to play Captain Sack, who looks a lot like Captain Jack Sparrow.
2455000	2459000	And I gotta say, he is adorable looking, if you see the little Sackboy with the Captain Jack outfit on, he's awesome.
2460000	2467000	And this is really in line with the fact that they have already announced that water is going to be the next big thing they add in LittleBigPlanet.
2468000	2475000	Because you know, the last big mechanic they added was a year ago in the Metal Gear Solid content, they added the gun, the paint gun, and that changed the way you build levels.
2475000	2482000	Well now they're going to have water, the Sackboys can swim in water, that's going to be huge for developmental levels, and whole new ideas will be there.
2483000	2489000	But of course, this is a great tie-in to have water-based content, because obviously, Pirates of the Caribbean, they sail on water.
2490000	2498000	This is all supposed to come out, by the way, the rumor is, all of this is hitting before Christmas, which would mean probably next week, if this is true.
2498000	2508000	Keep in mind, LittleBigPlanet has not had any major expansion like this, I mean, granted they've kept the game fresh with the levels, the costumes, and some of those things, the stickers and somewhat,
2509000	2515000	but this is the first major game-changing thing they've done since the Metal Gear Solid content.
2516000	2523000	And I think it's awesome, I will probably buy it, and I haven't played LittleBigPlanet in quite some time, so this is something that I guess you could say could get me back, I don't know.
2523000	2532000	So, hey, going into our chatroom, chat.orangelandradio.com, some of the comments from my earlier question about, do you think PSP games should be on the PS3?
2533000	2541000	ToaGak says, only if they give us our fucking UMD drive back. Well, technically they never took it away. The PSP 3000 still being made, still being sold, yes?
2542000	2545000	And much better than the PSP Go.
2545000	2554000	AlphaKananagram says, sure, why not? PS1 games are allowed on PS3 and they look shitty, so why not PSP games? Well, now hold on, the PS1 games only look shitty because you're spoiled.
2555000	2562000	And those games were made for a different time when we didn't have HD TVs, even though I'm only talking like 10 years ago, technology was different back then.
2563000	2566000	We're all spoiled now. They look shitty because we have better TVs, right?
2566000	2575000	Yeah. Let's see, BowerCTU says it's no different than the Super Game Boy. I guess that's true, you know, we put Game Boys on our TVs a long time ago.
2576000	2587000	Let's see, also going into the LittleBigPlanet story, AlphaKananagram says, Sky, also, you heard that the water expansion pack for LittleBigPlanet may be coming soon due to a leak in update trophies.
2587000	2597000	Yeah, I honestly think these two are probably tied together, and it's like, just like the Metal Gear Solid brought us the gun, pirates will probably bring us the water. That's my thought.
2598000	2606000	And one other thing from chat, Tigerclaw says, who knows, perhaps Sony is secretly working on a PSP 4000, which will probably be a hybrid of the Go or something.
2606000	2616000	You never know what Sony might be doing. I don't know so much about another PSP revision, I think honestly the next thing we're going to get is like a PSP 2, but I've been wrong before, who knows.
2617000	2619000	Anyhow, DarkSakura, what's up next for us?
2620000	2620000	Stuff.
2621000	2621000	And such?
2621000	2647000	Yeah, there's actually been an announcement by SNK for some Xbox Live Arcade games. We actually have Metal Slug 7 isn't coming out, but Metal Slug XX or maybe XX is, you know, the PSP remixed version of the DS one is going to be coming out in 2010 instead.
2647000	2660000	And as far as Xbox Live Arcade fighting games, there's going to be King of Fighters 2002 Ultimate Match and Neo Geo Battle Colosseum. There also will be the King of Fighters Sky Stage.
2661000	2662000	That looks stupid.
2663000	2665000	It looks incredibly stupid, but I think I want to play it just for lulz.
2666000	2669000	So hey, more Metal Slug for me.
2670000	2672000	And that's never quite a bad thing?
2672000	2677000	More flying Iori shooting things in the sky with his big Orochi self.
2678000	2679000	And how?
2680000	2692000	Well something you don't have to wait too long for would be this week's releases. And unfortunately, being that we're so close to Christmas, it is very light.
2693000	2700000	This week we have Twin Sector on PC. You have little kids, Reader Rabbit Kindergarten on the Nintendo DS.
2700000	2702000	They are still cranking out Reader Rabbit games?
2703000	2708000	Dude, you do not even have any idea. There is like four or five Reader Rabbit games coming out.
2709000	2710000	I remember Reader Rabbit on the Apple IIe.
2711000	2712000	Yeah.
2713000	2716000	They have four Wii games and four DS games coming out. Of course, all the same.
2716000	2732000	Konami Classics Vol. 1 and 2 this week. Vol. 1, of course, contains Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Frogger, and Super Contra, whereas Vol. 2 includes Russian Attack, Track and Field, and the regular Contra.
2733000	2737000	Both of those for 20 bucks and out on 360. They're basically just the Xbox Live arcade games.
2737000	2750000	And then also, more stuff for little kids. Playmobil Pirates and Playmobil Circus. Pirates for the DS and Circus for the Wii. And that's it.
2751000	2754000	That still sounds like a lot, considering where we're at.
2755000	2760000	That's sad. There's actually some better stuff. Well, next week's even lighter, but it's really like two games, but they're decent games.
2760000	2767000	Well, I wish I could say it's a slow week in Japan, but it's really not. It's actually still a pretty big week over there.
2768000	2780000	Going to the Japanese releases, on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, there is a 30th anniversary collection for Gundam. It's Gundam Musou 2. It comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
2781000	2784000	But Gundam Musou 2, isn't that Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2?
2784000	2789000	I believe so. It looks very much like it. The whole combo meter in the corner and everything.
2790000	2791000	Probably the re-release.
2792000	2800000	Yeah, and the graphics look very pretty. But, of course, this week is epic week in Japan, and actually for a lot of people here in the U.S. too, I know a lot of people are going to be importing.
2800000	2813000	Final Fantasy XIII does come out on the PlayStation 3. Seeing as the PlayStation 3 is region free, if you want to pay $100, yes, that's right, that's what some importers are charging for this, $100, you can import this game.
2814000	2816000	It's all Japanese. I don't feel like translating.
2817000	2822000	Yeah, but for some people that know it light or know enough and just can't wait until March, hey, there you go.
2823000	2824000	I did that with 8 and would never do it again.
2824000	2834000	The Wii has not been forgotten. There are some releases over there. Of course, they get the Gundam game too, as well as Need for Speed Nitro comes out in Japan and F1 2009, so a couple of racers there in Japan.
2835000	2842000	On the PlayStation 2, this game has a lulsy title, Death Connection comes out on the PlayStation 2. Not the Love Connection.
2843000	2844000	It's the Death Connection.
2845000	2850000	That's what comes after the Love Connection, the Death Connection. I've got to read this description. Can I read this here?
2850000	2856000	Amelia was entrusted to the priest when she was a baby. Growing up in the small town church, the girl became a gentle beauty.
2857000	2866000	Along with the priest and Joshua, a boy she sees as a brother, she lived a peaceful life. However, everything changed the night mafia members charged into the church seeking to end Amelia's life.
2869000	2877000	So it's got everything. It's got the mafia, church, religion, things. It's all in the Death Connection coming out on the PlayStation 2.
2877000	2887000	And on the Nintendo DS, Dear Girl Stories Hibiki Tokukun Daisaku Sen comes out in regular and limited edition.
2888000	2895000	Deca Sports DS also making its way to the Nintendo DS, and Loki I know has already probably pre-ordered Jewel Pet 2 comes out on the DS.
2895000	2907000	As well as a game I first read as Pee Pee Girl, but it's actually Poopy Girl. That's P-O-U-P-E-E Girl DS. That's right, a game called Poopy Girl.
2908000	2911000	I don't want to really know what this game is about, yet I am intrigued.
2912000	2921000	It's actually a game where you develop good fashion sense. You do hairstyle, eye color, shape of the face, and then you take her out and shop for her in Poopy Town.
2921000	2928000	And a total of eight people can play Poopy Girl all at once.
2929000	2931000	It's just not like po-pay or something? Like French or something?
2932000	2940000	The chat room is yelling at me. It's like po-pay, just the way it's pronounced. But I'm sorry when I read it in my honky American way. P-O-U-P-E-E Poopy Girl.
2940000	2954000	To which all the Japanese purists are screaming at me in chat room. On the PSP, Dice Dice Fantasia.
2955000	2956000	Dice Dice Baby?
2957000	2960000	Do you even care? Do you even care when Poopy Girl's out this week?
2961000	2962000	That... no.
2964000	2968000	Anyhow, moving on. Dark Sakura, what's coming out in the UK?
2968000	2979000	Well, not a busy week. We have, for our buddies overseas, we have on the 15th EverQuest Underfoot. Does anyone still play EverQuest?
2980000	2982000	A lot of people wouldn't be doing these expansions.
2983000	2991000	I guess. On the 16th we have Alien Breed Evolution. On the 17th we have Blue Toad Murder Files, whatever the fuck that is.
2991000	3002000	On the 18th we have Buzz Quiz World, and on the 19th we have Nicky Rockin' Ball. That's it.
3003000	3007000	I'm laughing over here from this comment in chat about Poopy Girl. Sorry, Po-Pay Girl.
3008000	3013000	Salacious Pop says, she spends the entire game walking funny and looking upset.
3014000	3015000	That is excellent.
3015000	3024000	AlphaKananagram says, Sky, y'all are trying to kill me by making me laugh to death. Well, we try to be funny once in a while.
3025000	3030000	Anyhow, moving on to some more news. Our classic game of the week, just a few minutes away.
3030000	3048000	Yes. So, apparently, I didn't even realize there was a whole lawsuit against Divino, but there was, apparently by Nintendo, trying to prevent the company from selling DS flash carts.
3048000	3065000	Apparently they won, I believe, their injunction in Hong Kong, but in France, and why they're trying to win it in France as well, apparently they lost.
3065000	3089000	Actually, Divino won that suit, and now, of course, Nintendo is appealing the ruling, and finally, I guess, another lawsuit against them to try to prevent them from selling DS flash carts because it enables people to, apparently they call it a game copying device.
3089000	3099000	Honestly, though, that's a little, I don't know, the device doesn't allow you to copy games, but it allows you to play copied games, I guess.
3100000	3106000	Okay, wait, somebody's gotta break this down for me, because I seem to remember talking about this when it was banned, or when the whole appeal was won in Hong Kong.
3107000	3110000	So now they're going to France. Is there a production of this going on there, too?
3111000	3112000	Well, it didn't win in Hong Kong. They actually lost in Hong Kong.
3113000	3113000	Oh.
3114000	3115000	They, actually, they still owe...
3116000	3117000	Shows you how much I was paying attention that night.
3117000	3124000	Yeah, Nintendo made a statement that Divino still owes the company damages from a ruling made in Nintendo's favor in Hong Kong last year.
3125000	3137000	And it says, last month, a Spanish criminal case was dismissed against a company selling DS flash carts, with the judge in the case ruling that the carts are not illegal since they can be used for many non-infringing purposes.
3137000	3151000	So, it's kind of a gray area. I think if they're claiming that they're distributing game copying devices, I think right there, that would, they would lose that, because the device cannot be used.
3152000	3159000	Well, I mean, I guess it could be used, I don't know if there's a device on there to copy games from that, but it's not really used in copying games.
3160000	3161000	Don't you own this device?
3162000	3162000	The R4?
3163000	3163000	Yeah.
3164000	3164000	I own two in my life.
3164000	3166000	I have a, I have a Ninja Pass too.
3167000	3168000	I have an R4 and a, um...
3169000	3170000	Okay, have you ever used the R4 to pirate a game?
3171000	3173000	To pirate a game? No, I've used it to play pirate games, yes.
3174000	3177000	Okay, I see, I, tricky, tricky, I see what you did there, okay.
3178000	3179000	Fine.
3180000	3185000	And I can't order from Divino because my bank doesn't like me ordering from countries across the sea.
3186000	3187000	Malaysia, I think, is where they're out of.
3188000	3189000	Yeah.
3189000	3205000	Alright, well, I, I don't know, I mean, I think if it's, uh, if it's being used for bad things, Nintendo has a right to some extent, but at the same time, there are legitimate purposes for these, I suppose, and you can't go after the, the people that are doing this for legitimate reasons.
3206000	3211000	You have to go after the people that are using it, you know, that are putting the, that are dumping the games and putting them on the web.
3212000	3213000	That's who they need to go after, is the people dumping the games.
3213000	3236000	It's just like, um, you know, with, like, BitTorrent and stuff like that, a lot of times they're going after the people that, the release groups that are dumping the titles because the downloading of the titles isn't really, you know, they're not really stealing any, I don't know, it's kind of tough with digital media and stuff, because you're not technically stealing something, you're just making a copy of it.
3236000	3244000	And they're kind of going after more, like, real piracy, like, people actually making bootlegs and selling them on the street type stuff.
3245000	3259000	Well, moving on to one more story before we get to the classic game of the week tonight, um, we were actually linked to this story on our Twitter and it was suggested that we talk about this and, uh, Kotaku ran a feature this week about who they're calling, uh, well, it says, I guess the name of the story is Achievement Chore.
3259000	3266000	She plays for Gamerscore whether it's fun for not, fun or not, and it spotlights this girl and her name is Kristen and I guess, uh, her last name was redacted, obviously.
3267000	3286000	Um, I guess the author at Kotaku ran into this gal playing a game and exchanging scores and I guess she is the, according to this story, the number four ranking woman worldwide in Gamerscore and if you want to know how big you gotta get your Gamerscore to get that high, it's something like, um, of course now I lost, oh, there it is, 165,000 is her current Gamerscore.
3286000	3296000	And they actually take a picture of her and I gotta, you know, she's, she's a very attractive woman, I gotta say. I guess she's a stay-at-home mom and, uh, this is part of what she does.
3297000	3302000	By the way, she also has, it almost looks like the exact same laptop I do. She has a little Toshiba, anyway, nobody cares.
3303000	3308000	But anyhow, they ran this little story on her, uh, she's a 24-year-old stay-at-home mom in Northwest Indiana.
3308000	3318000	She got started on this whole thing when it, I guess it became like a friendly race between her and her friend about Gamerscore and, um, it was a race to see who could get 20,000 first and now I guess it's just become an obsession.
3319000	3328000	The girl has, I guess, um, a Japanese Xbox 360 and a regular Xbox 360. She has mad respect in the community for, I guess, being nice.
3328000	3339000	Uh, she says, quote, once I found sites that had guides on which were the easy games, I beat 20,000 in like a month and a half. It got me hooked and it was like a drug. A bad drug, a bad habit.
3340000	3346000	So it's kind of interesting, I mean, we joke a lot about achievement whores here on the show and I know we've called Loki an achievement whore many times, but it's kind of like...
3347000	3348000	I just don't care anymore.
3348000	3363000	I stopped caring and I did too to some extent, but it's kind of interesting to see what makes them tick, you know, and I thought this story was kind of interesting to give some insight as to what makes the achievement whore want to go after all those scores.
3363000	3377000	Um, by the way, you might like this too. There is stuff that she does besides the Xbox 360, obviously she's a stay at home mom, but she also says, I'm an avid paintball player. I have my own gun, although that's another expensive hobby.
3378000	3386000	But yeah, I'd much rather go out to a bar, go bowling, play darts or pool than sit at home and boost games all night. I'm still young. And she does have a six year old girl that she's raising too.
3387000	3388000	So, there you go.
3389000	3390000	Rob, I'm playing with poopies.
3390000	3392000	Alright. Did you go onto the website?
3393000	3394000	Yes, I did.
3395000	3396000	Was it Tiger Claw? Linked us to the...
3397000	3398000	I love these things.
3399000	3409000	I've been playing, well, keep in mind, I used to play with the candy bar doll maker thing, and I've got my big dolls, so this is actually kind of fun for me, even though like, you know...
3410000	3411000	So you like poopy girls?
3412000	3415000	Don't make me shoot you in the face, Rob.
3415000	3427000	Since we were just talking about something we saw on Kotaku, I was just going to mention it real quick. There's a trailer I saw for The Sims 3, it was like a Happy Holidays trailer, that makes me want to play the game, actually.
3428000	3429000	Why is that?
3429000	3445000	It's the top ten reasons to play Sims, according to them. Your friends can throw rock and party, and then burn the house down, and so they show that, and then there's like another one, it's like, you know, these two women, oh, because learning a new language is sexy is number nine.
3446000	3448000	They have like the teacher wearing just lingerie and stuff.
3449000	3451000	So it's like all the really wrong things people do with The Sims.
3451000	3458000	Yeah, your sister can flirt with death, which is awesome, instead of your boyfriend, or her boyfriend, I guess.
3459000	3470000	And then they also have like, your kids can finally learn to get along, and they show the girl laughing maniacally, and her brother's on fire, and it's awesome.
3471000	3478000	Your grandma can still spy on the neighbors and not get arrested, and they have her peeping on some naked guy, which is kind of funny.
3478000	3486000	Your brother and sister, oh, your brother can finally get lucky, and they have like some chick staring them down.
3487000	3491000	Killing your boss, and then they have like, what are some of the other ones?
3492000	3501000	Experimenting, they have like two chicks, one dressed up like a cheerleader, one dressed up like, oh god, I don't remember what else the other one was.
3502000	3506000	Making out, and it's just all sex, violence, all the stuff you got.
3506000	3512000	All the great things about The Sims, right DarkSakura? Setting people on fire, it's your favorite thing about The Sims.
3513000	3514000	Actually, I like drowning him.
3515000	3516000	Nice.
3517000	3518000	That's funny, he's dying.
3519000	3525000	Alright, lol dying. Alright, well anyhow, if you're giving it to your best friend's mom, that was number two.
3525000	3544000	Oh my gosh. Alright, if Loki's done with his ideas on what he's gonna do horrifically in The Sims, then it's time for a segment we like to call the classic game of the week. A chance for DarkSakura to go through the gaming archives and pick a game from yesteryear that she says, you know what? You bitches should be checking this game out.
3546000	3547000	Yeah.
3547000	3554000	And I closed the link to whatever she sent me earlier for the game, but that's alright. If you don't have a game, again, that's okay, I'll find it.
3555000	3570000	No, I can get it. Well the game is Einhonder, which is a pretty cool shooting game. It's pretty rare. Not as in it was made by Rare, but it's pretty rare of a game.
3570000	3584000	But anyway, it's a side-scrolling shooter, it was done by Square, and it came out on PlayStation in 1997. It did get a re-release for PSN on June 25th.
3585000	3593000	It means single-handed, because the ship that you use has a single manipulator arm.
3594000	3595000	That was the one that I thought sucked.
3596000	3597000	Sorry, it's just the first one I found.
3597000	3599000	There's one on there for stage 7 or stage 5.
3600000	3601000	Okay, I'll find it.
3602000	3610000	I'll find the right thing. But yeah, it's about a war between the Earth and the Moon, and it has a little cool soundtrack done by Fukui Kenichiro.
3611000	3624000	So yeah, you play through the game, and it's sort of a 2.5D, so it's got shifting camera angles, and everything in the game is 3D, but you mostly play in a two-dimensional method.
3624000	3629000	You've got different multiples, you've got different difficulty settings, multiples of those.
3630000	3635000	You do have a free mode that gives you unlimited continues, but you cannot have a score.
3636000	3652000	You can get at different speeds, and you start off with a machine gun, and you can collect gun pods that will give you different enemy missions, or cannons, or guided missile launchers, or even a lightsaber type of thing.
3652000	3661000	There's also, you have to throw away your gun pods when you run out of ammo, so there's that.
3661000	3683000	Also, you have a multiplier bar and a hit gauge counter, so as you destroy the corners of the enemies, your hit counter increases, and you get multiplied points by that, but when you stop shooting things, your counter decreases.
3684000	3686000	So basically this is helping you for your score.
3686000	3693000	It's a pretty neat game. It's actually the first 3D shooter that Square did.
3693000	3719000	And they actually, it said that Square used some of what they learned from making Final Fantasy VII into Einhonder. And it actually, one cool thing about it is that there was another game that came out in Japan that was Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon, which is, you know, Chocobo's mystery dungeon.
3719000	3726000	And it had a bonus mystery data disk, which actually was memory card data for a lot of games, including Einhonder.
3727000	3738000	Working Designs wanted to bring it out, but Square just actually did it anyway. So, really cool game, really cool, really fun game.
3739000	3745000	And you have to understand, really fucking hot for this era on the Playstation 1, like the graphics were just outstanding.
3745000	3756000	Oh yeah, and it's a pretty difficult game too. But yeah, I'd have to say that the play in it is really tight.
3757000	3762000	And also, the music that goes with the stages, I always thought was spot on.
3765000	3771000	The only thing that actually has a problem with it, I think, is that you can't play two player.
3771000	3775000	Oh, that's a bummer. She can't be, I guess, Zweihonder.
3776000	3781000	Dude, if they did a sequel, I think they should do Zweihonder, and like, have two different gun arms.
3782000	3783000	It's possible.
3784000	3785000	That's it, Einhonder.
3786000	3793000	Alright, there you go kids, your classic game of the week this week is Einhonder, available on the Playstation numero uno.
3793000	3804000	Alright, that's going to do it for part 8 tonight, we're going to take a quick break though, we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, our little special Saturday edition that will also play again on Sunday, and also play again on the podcast.
3805000	3807000	So stay tuned, we'll be right back with plenty more.
3813000	3819000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Saturday afternoon, December the 12th of 2009.
3819000	3826000	That's right, we are taping a little bit early for tomorrow night's show, so you'll hear this again on Sunday, December 13th, of course, at our usual time.
3827000	3831000	And then of course on our podcast feed, available at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3832000	3837000	Now, during the break there, I had to get my new toy all out of the box and unpacked, and check this out.
3837000	3850000	Awesome. That's right, my FC Mobile, I have Guardian Legend running on it. It took a little bit to get it jammed in there just the right way.
3851000	3854000	I even blew on the cartridge just to make sure, you know, the old school way to get that stuff to work.
3855000	3858000	But it works! So awesome. So very, very happy.
3859000	3863000	Anyhow, we have plenty more show to get to tonight, including our calls as usual.
3863000	3867000	I know there's less people listening than usual because of our special time, but hopefully we'll still get a few calls.
3868000	3873000	And of course we've got Twitter topics coming up in just a moment, but first we have some rapid fire stories.
3874000	3882000	Yes, there is a game that's out there on Microsoft's community game service that will help you talk to girls.
3883000	3888000	That's right, it's an indie game called Don't Be Nervous Talking to Girls.
3888000	3905000	And it allows you to, I guess, practice by talking to a picture of a woman with some interactive dialogue that allows you to choose from a few different choices.
3906000	3912000	And if you don't, I guess, pick the right choice, she'll call the police.
3913000	3914000	Nice.
3914000	3922000	But there's some retarded choices, like there's one right here, it's all, that's one tall rollercoaster and greetings from planet Earth.
3923000	3928000	I would like to see DarkSakura play this game on how to talk to girls and see how it goes.
3929000	3933000	It's like, I am a girl! And I like being told I am from outer space!
3934000	3935000	It's only a dollar and 80 microseconds.
3936000	3936000	A whole dollar?
3937000	3940000	A whole dollar. I may pick this up just for shits and giggles.
3940000	3944000	Leo Shen in our chat room, chat.orangemantraded.com says, will they have a choice to put it in?
3947000	3948000	Stick it in!
3949000	3950000	Ah, yes.
3951000	3952000	Maybe in the sequel.
3953000	3959000	Maybe in the sequel. Well, Yakuza 3 is making its way over to the US as well.
3959000	3969000	It's going to be heading over here March 2010, and will feature the wonderful gameplay that the Japanese have already been able to check out for a while now.
3970000	3974000	And it's also actually coming to Europe and Australia around that same time frame as well, so that's kind of cool.
3975000	3981000	Also, 505 Games announced a brand new series that they're going to be putting out called Naughty Bear.
3982000	3986000	And I have to admit, their bear rendering ability is quite amazing.
3986000	3988000	You've been a very naughty bear.
3989000	3992000	Of course, in gay culture, naughty bear means a whole other thing.
3993000	4000000	Yeah, yeah. Apparently, the game is actually a violent action game starring an animated stuffed bear.
4001000	4006000	Specifically, a stuffed bear who swears revenge on other jerk bears for failing to invite them to a party.
4006000	4016000	And so, your goal is to scare and irritate and of course hurt other bears, racking up naughty points as you do, using weapons strewn about the game's 30 stages.
4017000	4019000	Wait, so you play a bear encouraged to rape other bears?
4020000	4022000	Well, they never said rape. They said hurt.
4023000	4024000	In the face.
4025000	4026000	That's kind of cool.
4027000	4029000	They're calling it Manhunt for Teddy Bears.
4029000	4038000	That's really what it is. This is about violence. This is just teddy bears. It's okay. You can tear Teddy Ruxpin limb from limb. It doesn't matter. He's just a bear.
4039000	4043000	And it's coming from the developer, actually. It's the same developer that put out Wet.
4044000	4048000	Looking in our chatroom, of course, they are still hung up on the talking to girl game.
4049000	4052000	Tigerclaw says they probably have a version for the girls on how to talk to guys.
4053000	4057000	I don't think they need one. It's just with your tits. That's basically how they do it, right, DarkSagra?
4057000	4062000	It's just two buttons. Giggle, flash, tits.
4063000	4066000	It's just two buttons. Giggle and tits.
4067000	4072000	BowerCTU in our chatroom says, are one of the choices Are You Poopy Girl?
4073000	4074000	Lol.
4075000	4078000	See, I like that. Taking it back to a previous topic in the show. Good job.
4079000	4085000	Anyhow, going on to some other stories. Brutal Legend, of course. How has Brutal Legend sales been? They've been okay, right?
4085000	4086000	It's been alright.
4087000	4094000	Well, hopefully this will integrate sales a little bit. A new download content piece called The Hammer of Infinite Fate is coming out this week on December 17th.
4095000	4105000	It is a chance for you getting to, I guess, carve a giant disembodied head into Mount Rockmore of Tim Schafer, the developer of Brutal Legend.
4106000	4107000	I guess that's what you get. I don't know.
4107000	4118000	You also get an upgrade that shows every collectible that's on the map and some new outfits for Eddie and, what's probably a highlight for a lot of people, four new multiplayer maps.
4119000	4127000	It's going to cost you $4.99 on PS3, yet $6 on the Xbox 360, but that might be an error because usually those things are the same.
4128000	4134000	Hey, if you still haven't picked up DJ Hero, a place you could probably grab it is the Guitar Hero store. It got knocked down to $79.
4134000	4145000	From what I understand, though, this thing got sold out very soon, so I don't think you can actually get this anymore, but it is still telling and worthy of reporting on that the price is already coming down,
4146000	4149000	meaning that maybe it's just a matter of time before this ends up in the bargain bins. I don't know.
4150000	4156000	As I tweeted earlier this week, the MPD numbers came out, and it's sold 333,000 units total.
4157000	4158000	Well, that's not bad.
4159000	4160000	In two months? No, that's not bad.
4161000	4162000	That's not bad at all.
4162000	4167000	It'll probably still sell a little more for Christmas. Do you think it's worthy enough of getting a sequel, then?
4168000	4169000	Oh yeah.
4170000	4177000	If Guitar Hero rocks the 80s or spins the 80s, I would be all over that. That'd be pretty awesome.
4178000	4187000	My problem with DJ Hero, and it's the same problem that I have with the Guitar Hero series, is there's not enough download content. We've had two so far.
4187000	4191000	I mean, come on, man. Both have been pretty good, for what it's worth.
4192000	4196000	But if this was a harmonics game, I'd be getting download content every fucking week.
4198000	4203000	Until they decide to discontinue it, which has finally happened on the PSP one, which is strange.
4204000	4210000	Well, that's fine, because that probably didn't sell that well, but Rock Band 2, you know, come on. Tons of shit out there.
4210000	4217000	Did you notice, by the way, that the Best Buy demo stations now are like a Rock Band 2 slash Beatles Rock Band hybrid game?
4218000	4220000	Oh, it's kind of interesting that the demo demos both games.
4221000	4223000	It's both games? Yeah. It's kind of interesting.
4224000	4230000	But it makes sense. Hey, also in Rapid Fire Tonight, the Nintendo Virtual Console has released some new stuff.
4231000	4232000	A lot, a lot of stuff this week.
4232000	4242000	Street Fighter Alpha apparently came out, as well as the arcade version of Shinobi, and Rayman for the DSi, which I thought was kind of interesting, is now out.
4243000	4244000	So that's a big title on DSi.
4245000	4250000	Lots of other stuff available on DSi, including Ball Fighter, Pop Island, Army Defender, and My Notebook.
4251000	4258000	Not a lot of exciting stuff on WiiWare, but of course the Virtual Console got the arcade version of Shinobi and Street Fighter Alpha for the Super Nintendo.
4258000	4262000	So if you were a fan of Alpha back in the day, you might want to go grab that.
4263000	4265000	That is now available on the Virtual Console.
4266000	4267000	Dr. Sakura?
4268000	4272000	Well, in other news, we have something that actually I'm pretty considering trying out.
4273000	4277000	It's a Voltron game on iPhone, and apparently has the best unpause feature.
4277000	4296000	It's actually being put out for the 25th anniversary of the series, so you've got 30 levels, 6 acts total, where you play as the lions going through the galaxy to stop Zarkon and everybody, and all the weapons and everything.
4296000	4314000	And it's actually supposed to be, I think, pretty neat, but there's a video up here actually that I haven't watched yet, but apparently the unpause sound effect is supposed to be amazing.
4315000	4318000	I imagine they're like rips from Voltron or something, probably?
4319000	4320000	I'm going to check this out.
4320000	4325000	Oh, there's stupid ads.
4326000	4328000	Are you trying to play a little video over there?
4329000	4330000	Yeah, and now the ad won't stop.
4331000	4332000	Stupid Google!
4332000	4352000	Continuing on with this music over the background, Pac-Man Championship Edition is on the iPhone as well for $3, and that's the revamped Xbox Live Arcade one with all the fun mode, but this is a limited starting price.
4353000	4354000	So now let's go back to Voltron.
4355000	4356000	So Voltron came to the iPhone today?
4357000	4358000	Oh yeah, someone talking about it.
4358000	4364000	Blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, there we go.
4365000	4368000	See, I don't know if anyone can hear any of this.
4369000	4370000	I'm trying to find the unpause.
4371000	4375000	So it's the sound effects.
4376000	4377000	I'm assuming it's what it is.
4378000	4384000	And it sounds like the music in the game is actually from, dude, you have Sven when you start off, that's cool.
4384000	4389000	Anyway, moving forward, how about some Rock Band stuff?
4390000	4391000	Rock Band!
4392000	4397000	Rubber Soul! Finally! Finally, finally, finally! Very happy, because that's my favorite Beatles album.
4398000	4408000	So we are going to be getting Rubber Soul next week for a Beatles Rock Band, because we already got Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road.
4408000	4419000	And then we are also going to be, for the other Rock Band, we're going to be getting All American Rejects, 30 Seconds to Mars, and more Green Day.
4420000	4428000	And Rock Band unplugged download content is, I'm not sure.
4429000	4436000	It actually isn't going to be getting any more download content from what it seems. So, that's it.
4436000	4440000	By the way, some late-breaking news, I believe, speaking of the whole Rock Band thing.
4441000	4448000	Apparently, there's this teaser going on on MTV.com about this whole, I guess, Green Day Rock Band game.
4449000	4451000	Is there possibly a Rock Band game going on with Green Day in it?
4452000	4455000	I don't think it's going to be as big as, like, Beatles Rock Band. It may be an add-on content thing.
4456000	4460000	And we've speculated this before, like the ACDC game was.
4461000	4462000	Yeah.
4462000	4468000	Perhaps. This might be something that actually shows up during the VGAs later on, which I guess are happening later tonight.
4469000	4473000	I don't think, I mean, Green Day is okay, but do you really think they're popular enough to warrant their own game?
4474000	4477000	You know, I mean, you've got to live up to the Beatles.
4478000	4485000	And I realize the VGAs are on tonight, but come on. You're going to see all the winners later on, and all the clips will be on YouTube, any of the game trailers.
4485000	4492000	Yeah, well, but we also have some great programming on All Games Radio tonight. We have Undersedation Live at, I believe, 8 o'clock Pacific.
4493000	4498000	And Travis Is Always a Lolsie Time. That's the show I grew up on years ago. Video Game Show is on tonight, too, right after us.
4499000	4505000	Well, not right after, but about 7 o'clock, too. So stay tuned for both of those shows coming up on All Games Radio if you are listening live on Saturday.
4506000	4508000	Meanwhile, we've got some Twitter topics to get into.
4508000	4518000	Going over to the Twitter at twitter.com slash o-l-r. We asked for some questions before the show.
4519000	4525000	Some folks talking about Orange Lounge Radio Revolution's second mix, which I guess has some unlocks.
4526000	4535000	Of course, this is the DDR game that they've made that apparently, by the way, hosts, check your emails later on, because apparently the creators have sent us a sneak peek to check out.
4535000	4544000	I'm very curious. I find it odd that I host this show and I know really very little about what's going on here, so I'm very curious to see it, so there you go.
4545000	4553000	Let's see. Just some people talking about listening to the show or not listening to the show tonight.
4554000	4560000	Let's see. Going to Leo Shan on Twitter says, any songs from a recent game that you can't get out of your head?
4560000	4564000	For me, it's Bayonetta's Fly Me to the Moon climax mix.
4565000	4578000	I thought that was kind of funny. My friend's like, hey, isn't this from, like, Neon Genesis? You know, like, yeah, and a bunch of other stuff, but it's an awesome game.
4578000	4591000	I don't know if I have, like, a song stuck in my head, especially not one from a video game. For the longest time, though, I had that mix of Radio Gaga and Mary J. Blige from the download of DJ Hero that would get stuck in my head so easily.
4592000	4596000	A lot of the stuff from DJ Hero's stuck in my head, because I played in my car on repeat, basically, so.
4597000	4601000	Yeah. A lot of, like, Bust a Move with Around the World, you know?
4602000	4605000	That's a good mix. That's a game I haven't played in forever that I really need to.
4605000	4608000	Old school Bust a Move groove, whatever you want to call it.
4609000	4621000	Let's see, also, SSJ100Matt on Twitter is saying, Target is having some nice game deals starting this Sunday, including DJ Hero $88 and Zelda Spirit Tracks $25.
4621000	4638000	That was another game I forgot to mention that I was playing this week, and it's alright, but my thing is, it's not the same as, like, you know, the other games where the method of travel by boat was kind of a necessity.
4639000	4648000	The fact that they're like, oh no, we can't go to these parts of the lands because the tracks have disappeared, that's just to me saying, I'm lazy and I don't want to walk there.
4648000	4655000	It's like fucking walking was all you did in Zelda, you know, Zelda 2, you know, Zelda 3, even.
4656000	4660000	But now I'm too good for walking, I need to take a train everywhere.
4661000	4662000	Waaaaaaah.
4663000	4665000	It's really, you know, obnoxious.
4666000	4672000	But yeah, it's still as fun as the original, well, I'd say, you know, the last game that they had.
4673000	4676000	How does Zelda translate as, like, a rail shooter, though? That seems so odd to me.
4676000	4677000	It's not, I thought that's what it was.
4678000	4689000	No, it's just, they have these parts where you're riding a train, and that's kind of like the boat, you know, you get a cannon on the back, and there's evil trains on the tracks, which is retarded, but whatever.
4690000	4692000	I want another Wind Waker.
4693000	4699000	I mean, they keep putting out these DS games, so let's do another, like, GameCube style game or whatever, because Wind Waker is awesome. I need to go back and actually play that.
4700000	4702000	A lot of people disagree with you, but they can suck it, right?
4702000	4709000	They can suck it, because guess what? How many games have we seen that have been emulating, you know, the Wind Waker style being released? Well, at least two of them.
4710000	4716000	How many games have we seen, you know, emulating the, you know, style of the Marie Lizzick Zelda? One.
4717000	4718000	So tough.
4719000	4724000	Alright, well, we'll see. Alright, listen, that's it for Twitter topics tonight. Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to give us a follow.
4725000	4728000	Meanwhile, back to some more gaming news, and then our mailbag before too long.
4728000	4740000	Yes, there's a new patent that's been put out for the Sony Motion Controller, and it's showing a new feature, including swappable buttons, or like some sort of connector.
4741000	4750000	Basically, at the top of the controller, or possibly even the bottom, I don't know, they show this kind of, like, upside down, with the Cosmic Ice Cream Cone facing down.
4750000	4772000	Apparently, there is a little spot that you could possibly put in, either a D-pad, they have, like, the face buttons, you know, the X circle, square, triangle, and then what looks like a spinner, or some sort of spinning knob of some sort, maybe like the jog dial, I guess, on an iPod or something like that.
4772000	4787000	And that's kind of part of this little thing, so maybe instead of, like, add-ons that you might see with, you know, the nunchuck and stuff like that, and the Wii, they're just going to have these replaceable control buttons.
4788000	4796000	But honestly, I don't see what the point is in adding face buttons to it. I mean, when, you just have some generic buttons, and if you want to use them-
4796000	4806000	I don't know, it gives some more diversity for the developers. I would just worry about losing that shit. Those things look small, like, I would think losing them would be the problem. These little convertible things.
4807000	4821000	Well, not only that, but, like, I would think, though, that, you know, the directional pad or whatever could be easily, you know, done with just four buttons, like the face buttons, so there's no need to double up on that, and the jog dial... I don't really see why they would need that.
4821000	4827000	To spin the wheel in a Wheel of Fortune game, I don't know. I don't know.
4828000	4840000	But to make the movement, then, with the whole motion controller. It's like, this is about, like, I don't know if you saw the article about Ubisoft with their, you know, crappy camera that they put out with that, you know, your self-fitness thing or whatever.
4840000	4856000	Your shape, actually. And they have a new racquetball game coming out to kind of compete with Wii Sports Tennis or whatever, and it uses, as an option, it uses the camera. Well, all the previews I've seen using this camera have been crap.
4856000	4869000	Toagak in Chat says, Have you ever dealt with a DS game card before? Those are easy to lose. Like, saying that, you know, well, these things aren't much bigger than a DS card, probably, so if you can keep track of a DS game card, you can probably keep track of these little things. Maybe.
4870000	4873000	Maybe, but, like, there's got to be an easier way to do this.
4874000	4883000	Well, and it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be true. You know, it's just, generally, patents, so that no patent whores try to get in there and, you know, patent it first.
4883000	4886000	I'll just assume ten years down the road, you know, they always seem to do that.
4887000	4900000	Well, Star Trek Online is coming out next year, and, of course, there's quite a few people excited about that, including our very own Dark Soccer, and I've got to admit, I am pretty excited about it, too, even though I'm a big wow-whore, and I've got to say, lovin' the new Patch 3-3. I didn't say this during my gaming week.
4901000	4911000	Actually, I like it, too. Well, I've noticed that it flashes red now when you're being attacked, and it's sort of like, what the hell? Oh, I'm being attacked, instead of just random roar.
4911000	4922000	And the quest tracking thing, if you didn't have a mod for that before, is pretty awesome. I used a quest helper mod, so I already had that, and I've got to say, this whole Dungeon Finder is awesome.
4923000	4931000	All the looking for group stuff is gone now. It's crazy, and I've got to be honest, all the groups I've gotten through the system have been really good.
4931000	4943000	Like, I have yet to get a group full of douchebags like I used to get before. I don't know what it is. It's not like they have a filter on what kind of players get to use the group system, but I've just gotten a lot of really good players.
4944000	4946000	So, I don't know if there's anybody excited or what.
4947000	4951000	I don't know. I don't know. Very, very exciting. Anyway, but we want to get back to Star Trek Online.
4951000	4961000	Star Trek Online, of course, is coming out soon, and a whole shitload of pre-order bonuses, but of course, it depends on where you pre-order it. That's right.
4962000	4965000	And depending on where you pre-order, Star Trek Online will change the bonus that you get.
4966000	4973000	So, for example, if you pre-order the game at GameStop, you can have the classic USS Enterprise. You can only get the classic Enterprise at GameStop.
4973000	4982000	So, there's going to be everybody riding around the USS Enterprise. I guess. I don't know. At the Best Buy, you can get a pet Tribble or a Targ, depending on what your faction is.
4983000	4984000	Dude, totally want a Targ.
4985000	4988000	And everybody knows when you get one pet Tribble. It's actually hundreds of pet Tribbles.
4989000	5000000	If you pre-order on Amazon, you get a liberated Borg bridge officer with unique nanotechnology augmentation. So, in other words, you can have sex of nine as your bridge officer there.
5000000	5006000	Dude, I actually totally think that I'm going to get mine on Amazon now, because I've actually got a gift card for Amazon.
5007000	5007000	Do you really?
5008000	5008000	Yeah, I do.
5009000	5017000	Very cool. Let's see. Also, direct-to-drive, a multi-spatial personal shield. It regenerates itself and the player health. That's from direct-to-drive.
5018000	5019000	Okay, that's actually really cool.
5019000	5033000	At Walmart, you get bonus skill points. You'll be able to bestow additional skill points. At Target, you get a TR-116 ground weapon. That's a micro transporter that beams projectiles to the Target. No line of sight is required.
5034000	5041000	And lastly, if you do it on Steam, you get chromodynamic armor. It improves your critical hits and damage of energy weapons.
5041000	5050000	So, I mean, those are all like game-changing items. That's a little weird to me, that depending on where you buy the game can kind of change up the game for you.
5051000	5059000	I mean, I imagine even these little items they talk about aren't like the best things in the game. It seems to me, I gotta be honest, the Walmart one sounds good.
5060000	5066000	If you get extra skill points that you can't get any other way, that seems like the best deal right there.
5066000	5076000	But it seems to me, though, that, well, are they completely unique? I mean, does it say specific? Because, I mean, if you can get skill points as you keep going, you know, as you level, then what's the point?
5077000	5082000	What kind of skills can you get from Walmart anyways? I mean, how to dress?
5083000	5087000	Which one had the, um, the, the, what was it, the transphasic shield?
5088000	5092000	Um, direct-to-drive has the shield that regenerates itself and your health.
5092000	5102000	I mean, I can imagine a Walmart bonus as being like, you know, you get to command the Enterprise, except the Enterprise has a new paint job with a Confederate flag on it.
5103000	5112000	Honestly, I think, I wouldn't really want the classic Enterprise anyway, because given when the game is set, you'd like, it's like, it's like driving, um...
5113000	5114000	A hoopty.
5114000	5121000	I gotta be honest, the GameStop pre-order sounds the least interesting to me. I've gotta be honest, you know, this is Star Trek Online, not remake Star Trek The Next Generation.
5122000	5132000	Well, it'd be the equivalent of everyone driving around in, like, a brand new Bugatti, right? And you're driving a 1983 Ford Escort.
5134000	5134000	Nice.
5135000	5135000	Seriously.
5136000	5137000	A Geo Metro.
5137000	5143000	I'm a pet whore, though, in WoW, so I'm almost, uh, down for this Best Buy pet tribble. That sounds kinda awesome.
5144000	5145000	Is that the only way you're gonna be able to get this pet tribble?
5146000	5146000	Don't know.
5147000	5149000	I mean, is there gonna be a tribble wearing a Best Buy shirt or something like that?
5150000	5150000	Don't know.
5151000	5162000	And besides that, the whole, the, you can, although I'm sure the tribbles are actually 90% reproductive organs, um, you can just feed them very little and they won't have enough energy to breed.
5162000	5170000	A few comments from our chatroom at chat.orensonshooter.com on this story. VaniceLux says, exclusive Walmart greeter class. Maybe that's what you get at Walmart.
5171000	5179000	SalaciousPop says, you're not gonna know how or what to min to max if you're just starting, and 99% of the MMOs nerf a lot of stuff within the first 90 days.
5180000	5185000	SSJ100Matt says, you can probably buy those devices and armor bonuses in some sort of store in the game.
5185000	5195000	And BowerCTU says, I want the classic Enterprise. So, you know, screw what I think. No, that's, obviously there will be a lot of people that want it and there'll probably be a lot of them in game.
5196000	5200000	Because, you know, GameStop is obviously still a very, very big retailer where a lot of people are gonna get this.
5201000	5207000	But just so you know, there's choices, so if Star Trek Online is really important to you, you might want to think around about where you pre-order the game.
5208000	5211000	I'll probably end up getting it on Steam so I don't have to go outside the house, but we'll see.
5211000	5219000	Well, I'm probably gonna get mine on Amazon because I have, thanks to Becky who's already given me one of my presents, I have a $40 gift card.
5220000	5222000	Woo! Poor GameCrazy though, I didn't see them on the list.
5223000	5224000	Well...
5225000	5226000	Maybe they'll get something else, who knows.
5227000	5228000	No comment.
5229000	5230000	Alright, moving on to another story, DarkSakura.
5231000	5233000	Well, in OtherStuff...
5234000	5235000	Yay, OtherStuff!
5235000	5259000	Thanks, Rob. PS3 actually won Metacritic's console of the year. They did a big survey on it and actually the higher rated games came out, higher rated games were on Xbox 360 than PS3, but the winner overall was still the PS3.
5259000	5265000	Which is kind of crap. But then again, Uncharted 2, you know, meh.
5266000	5287000	The Wii did okay on the thing too, but I mean, and also though, to keep going further into the list though, the best rated Xbox game was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, and Metroid Prime Trilogy was on Wii, Street Fighter IV scored the best for PC, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was number one on PSP and DS.
5287000	5288000	So...
5289000	5301000	Ah, this seems like one of those stories that's just there to start a controversy, you know, to get the PSP fanboys and the... I'm sorry, not PSP, the Sony fanboys and the Microsoft fanboys all riled up.
5301000	5316000	But you know, it's been a good year for Sony. They've, you know, the price drop was what they needed to do three years ago and it's finally bringing a lot of people on board and I've heard a lot of people talk about how they're probably going to take the plunge and get the PS3 now, you know, with Blu-ray and so forth.
5317000	5323000	I think they're going to have a really good Christmas season. I mean, we'll see when the numbers come out. Certainly Microsoft's not out. Hell no.
5323000	5330000	They've already sold millions of consoles. I think there's going to be a lot of people who just simply have more than one console in this day and age, you know?
5331000	5337000	So, alright. Let's see, we'll move on to some more news stories and then we'll get to the mailbag in just a minute here.
5337000	5354000	Yes. So this is kind of neat. We had a game that just came out, Avatar, that supported 3D with, you know, actually stereoscopic 3D with TVs that supported, you know, 3D gaming. Some of the 120 MHz TVs.
5355000	5356000	Is that because a movie is supposed to be in 3D too?
5356000	5374000	Yes, it is. And it's kind of neat though because Avatar actually, it was, it's dependent on which TV it is. They had a bunch of different options that you could do, you know, including Reel-D was one of those, which you find in a lot of the cinemas nowadays, which is the polarized glasses.
5374000	5392000	Well, now Namco is adopting stereoscopic 3D as well for, they've gotten some 3D development tools and you're going to see these in an upcoming game. An upcoming as yet unannounced Namco Bandai title.
5393000	5394000	Soulcalibur V.
5395000	5398000	I don't know, but it's neat. I mean, I think this is the way games are going to go.
5399000	5400000	Yeah, but how many TVs are fitted for this?
5400000	5418000	Not many. And the thing is, not only do you have to have these TVs, you have to have those glasses too. So, the Reel-D wouldn't be bad. If you could do the Reel-D stuff, like, on your TV, I mean, because that's just a, it's polarized glasses. I mean, that's, those glasses cost like five bucks. I mean, that would be, I think, the way to go.
5418000	5435000	When you get the more expensive, like, shutter glasses, you know, their actual hardware, they have, you know, timing and everything, that might be a little bit difficult. But, I think it's almost like pushing the technology too quick. I mean, we just got people sort of adopted to HDTVs, not everybody's kind of on board with that.
5436000	5440000	I can't believe this Avatar game's already supporting it. It seems so early. You know, I realize...
5441000	5441000	I hear it's good though.
5441000	5463000	I mean, I hear that Avatar's whole thing is, you know, really pushing what they do with cinema now, but, man. And by the way, TigerClaws, Lincoln, and Chad, apparently, even though I was bagging on the game a little, or on the movie a little bit last week about how I kind of don't look interested in it, Avatar the movie apparently has an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes right now. So, I guess some people are being pretty wowed by it.
5464000	5464000	By the game?
5465000	5465000	No, the movie.
5466000	5467000	The movie? It's not out yet.
5467000	5473000	Well, it had its premiere in London, so some critics were probably there. It's probably had its critics screening.
5474000	5481000	Well, I'm going to go see it, and in 3D, because that's the way it's meant to be seen, but if it's crap, then I'll call it.
5482000	5485000	Are you going to see it by Sunday? Review it on next week's show?
5486000	5491000	I don't know. I want to go see it with my dad, because the wife does not want to see that movie.
5491000	5497000	I see. I see. And I think he's gone, so I might not be able to see it. She may go see it, though.
5498000	5500000	I'm sure some of our chatters will let us know next week, if nothing else.
5501000	5501000	We're definitely going to see it next week.
5502000	5504000	I will give you a review of Princess and the Frog next week. I'm going to see that tomorrow.
5505000	5507000	I want to see that, too. Maybe I'll see that tomorrow.
5508000	5509000	That you could probably get the wife to see.
5510000	5514000	She actually, I do remember now, she does want to see Avatar, because she said it looked neat.
5515000	5516000	Oh, there you go.
5516000	5523000	All right. Let's see. Moving on to another story here about something probably the wife wouldn't be interested in at all.
5524000	5525000	I don't know, Loki. Maybe she would be.
5526000	5535000	Bible Adventures is a new game that's coming out from Left Behind Games, which I want to say I remember reporting on the fact that the studio was developed quite some time ago.
5536000	5538000	And do the Left Behind Game.
5538000	5549000	So now they're doing Bible Adventures is their new game. It's going to educate young children by teaching them academic lessons vital to early childhood development through Bible stories.
5550000	5553000	So in other words, it's going to be throwing the Bible at them at an early age.
5554000	5560000	You know, I could see this maybe being more of like a downloadable game. I mean, that would be a little bit more popular, I think.
5561000	5562000	No, it's coming out as an actual game.
5562000	5573000	I don't want to sell this. It's not that I don't like selling, you know, not that I have anything against the Bible or anything, but I don't want to sell that. I mean, it's like, you need this because people love the Bible.
5574000	5584000	Anyway, it's based on the Charlie Churchmouse stories. It's going to span both the Old and the New Testament, and it will teach mathematics, spelling, and I love this, reasoning skills.
5585000	5587000	WWJD.
5587000	5591000	I prefer WWTF.
5592000	5596000	IDGAF. WWJD.
5597000	5608000	Anyhow, the CEO of Left Behind has said that they expect their financial projections to grow exponentially as they transition from a PC game developer to a Wii and Xbox developer.
5608000	5619000	That's right. Bible Adventures apparently is coming out for the Wii and the Xbox 360, and I love this. Joystiq, who ran this story, one of the many sites who ran the story this week, said,
5620000	5622000	But what about PS3 owners? Well, they can go to hell.
5623000	5624000	And then the link, though.
5625000	5627000	The link is for Dante's Inferno. I know. I love it. It's funny. I lolled.
5627000	5637000	You know what, though? Like it or not, there's a market for this stuff. They'll sell these in those Christian bookstores.
5638000	5641000	I just want to know when we're getting dance praise or whatever the Guitar Hero equivalent was.
5642000	5643000	Guitar praise? Yeah, I remember that.
5644000	5646000	Do I get to hold my hand up like I feel Jesus?
5647000	5648000	Where's DJ Praise?
5649000	5651000	DJ Praise? Maybe you should make that game, Loki.
5652000	5653000	No, I shouldn't.
5653000	5660000	Alright, anyhow, forget it. Let's move on to the mailbag. Every week, you guys send us e-mails at Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com,
5661000	5665000	and DarkSakura jumps into the mailbag head first and instantly deletes them.
5666000	5671000	But not before she picks out a few of her favorites to read here on the air in a segment we call The Mailbag.
5672000	5674000	Who's e-mailed us this week?
5674000	5683000	Starting with an awful joke. So it's from AZHP. Hi, OLR crew. AZHP here celebrating the release of the new Silent Hill Wii game with a crude joke for everyone.
5684000	5685000	Yay! Yay! Joke!
5686000	5689000	What do you call what happens to your boobs after Pyramid Head rapes you?
5690000	5692000	What? Silent Hill shattered mammaries.
5694000	5700000	Now that we've got that out of the way, have you guys heard about the Silent Hill stage play plan for Sweden?
5700000	5707000	Yes, we already did that. If it's as good as the last Konami spinoff play I wrote into the show about DDR the Musical,
5708000	5712000	then I'm sure we can all say that we're extremely excited to see what comes out of this.
5713000	5719000	There aren't any details besides the flyer which has been making the rounds on gaming blogs, but it's Silent Hill, so it's plenty enough to get excited about. Am I right?
5720000	5723000	TTFN, ta-ta for now. AZHP. Yeah, we covered that.
5724000	5728000	By the way, AZHP, I got this for you for your joke.
5728000	5734000	Oh, wait. Sound cue fail. Now this is for me and AZHP.
5739000	5741000	We just need to get one of those fancy mixing boards with the buttons.
5742000	5744000	Yes, we do. We need a fancy mixing board with buttons. Let's get on that.
5745000	5748000	I will get on that because you already told me what to do.
5749000	5750000	Yay.
5751000	5752000	Next up comes from Gray Fox.
5753000	5756000	Dear O.L.R., I need your help.
5756000	5758000	No. Give me a dollar.
5759000	5763000	All of my life I have been in love with Zelda and Final Fantasy series.
5764000	5771000	Up to this point I have played almost every game in the series, but due to how long it takes to beat those types of games, I find that it seems more like a chore than fun anymore.
5772000	5779000	I remember the days where I would play these games all day and not think twice.
5779000	5789000	Now with so much of my time being taken up by other interests, I find myself having less time for games than finding myself remembering my relentless quests across Hyrule or summoning some ridiculously large beast in Final Fantasy.
5790000	5794000	So I have asked myself if other people have encountered the same thing.
5795000	5796000	Yes.
5797000	5799000	Yes. I don't have patience anymore.
5800000	5802000	I also have life.
5802000	5809000	I have Gamer ADD. I have told this on the show many, many times. I have the worst case of Gamer ADD and it's not helping my wallet.
5810000	5815000	I will buy $60 games and I swear to God I play them once and then never play them again. It's a disgusting, filthy habit. I need to stop.
5816000	5818000	I have a game right over here that I haven't played yet. Rob, you should stay and play it with me sometime.
5819000	5820000	Sometime, yeah.
5821000	5822000	I have Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
5823000	5824000	You still haven't played that? You've had that for like two months.
5825000	5826000	Well, now my hand works.
5827000	5828000	Oh yeah, that's right. You got it when you had your hand, drama.
5828000	5833000	But yeah, actually I was playing through Blue Dragon and put that aside.
5834000	5835000	You got pretty far in that too.
5836000	5841000	Lost Odyssey. I've tried Lost Odyssey twice. Although I will blame the second time on my Xbox 360 borking.
5842000	5846000	I will also blame though that the last time I quit playing Grandia was because I got tired of reading that much Japanese.
5846000	5857000	To be honest, I've taken a liking to independent games like Bit.Trip Beat and World of Goo because I can usually beat the games within a few weeks.
5858000	5861000	Which makes me wonder if I'm no different from when I first started playing games like Mario Brothers or Duck Hunt.
5862000	5866000	So this brings me back to my original question. Am I crazy? Am I thinking too much? Help me out, Gray Fox.
5867000	5872000	Dude, just play whatever's fun. If it's not fun, don't play it. Don't force yourself into a mold you don't fit in.
5872000	5879000	And I think tastes change with time. You know, and maybe it does have something to do with age. I don't know because I had much more patience when I was little.
5880000	5885000	Because I play some of those 8-bit games now and I don't have the patience to collect everything like I used to when I was a kid.
5886000	5890000	And there's also a lot of peer pressure out there to be playing certain games, you know, like the popular ones. Like you'd be in the new crowd.
5891000	5892000	Like smoking crack the game.
5893000	5897000	Yet, yet I spend hours upon hours upon hours on World of War crack. Go figure.
5898000	5900000	Well there's, I mean some of those are just good though.
5900000	5907000	But for, I think part of it with an MMO is that because it is something that you can just pick up, play for a little bit and put away.
5908000	5912000	It has that casual aspect on it unless you're like I guess one of those freaks that goes raiding.
5913000	5918000	Hey. I don't go like I used to. Raiding kind of ruined WoW for a little while for me.
5919000	5921000	But keep in mind for that, that's also a social aspect.
5922000	5923000	It is. It is. It really is.
5923000	5930000	And for me when I play, I play with like one person.
5931000	5936000	I've described World of Warcraft to friends that I have that don't get the Warcraft obsession or you know just are curious about it.
5937000	5941000	I will say it's like a chat room with fireballs is World of Warcraft for me.
5942000	5949000	Yeah. And it's kind of neat because friends I have who might live across the country, it gives us a chance, I know this is going to sound so dorky and nerdy.
5950000	5951000	I know. I agree with that.
5951000	5956000	It gives us a chance to hang out and do something even though yes I understand it's not real life.
5957000	5960000	But keep in mind I'm talking about friends that live states and states and thousands of miles away.
5961000	5964000	We get to kind of do something together even if it's not you know going outside.
5965000	5966000	So take that as you will.
5967000	5969000	No. I completely agree with that. I have the same logic about it actually.
5970000	5974000	So we've got one more email from Jim Sally. What's this? Jim Sally?
5975000	5976000	Wait. Jim Sally?
5977000	5978000	Jim Sally.
5978000	5983000	I actually ran home to try to catch the end of it tonight.
5984000	5986000	He actually said this is the best show ever so I guess he's talking about last week.
5987000	5989000	I actually ran home to try to catch the end of it tonight.
5990000	5993000	Any idea what happened to Dead Pixel Live? Later JS.
5994000	6004000	Last week was, we got a lot of compliments on last week's show which is weird because I didn't think we did anything special but talk about more porn than usual so I guess the chatters like porn I don't know.
6005000	6006000	I don't even remember what we did.
6006000	6017000	I don't know the latest update from last week. My thought is they had an epilogue but they're still on the schedule so they're still doing something.
6018000	6025000	So keep an eye on AllGames.com. I think they have their own website at DeadPixelLive.com and you can check out what's going on there.
6026000	6033000	I have not heard that they have left the network or anything like that so I don't know if they're just going through some changes over there or what's going on.
6033000	6036000	But usually when shows change and stuff I'm like the last to hear about it.
6037000	6043000	A Sunday night people are kind of self-sufficient I suppose. They don't keep us in the loop on what's going on the rest of the week. I don't know.
6044000	6046000	In other news Rob? I still have glue on my fingers.
6047000	6057000	I'm sure if something is going on Tigerclaw in our chat will give us an update because he's very good about jumping in with what's going on at AllGames Radio when I'm not as in the loop.
6057000	6067000	So there you go. Is that it for emails? Alright so if you have emails you want to send us mailbag at OrangeloungeRadio.com.
6068000	6070000	Let's get into the FUs of the week.
6070000	6087000	Music
6088000	6091000	FU to the situation with my mother. That's all I'm gonna say.
6092000	6095000	Not to my mother just with the situation.
6095000	6100000	Music
6101000	6107000	FU to having a cold and Rob I'm just gonna take this moment to say.
6108000	6111000	There's a couple arcade cabinets and a ranch recorded open for $25 each.
6112000	6119000	Missing a monitor but they'll sell you a monitor for $50. You can get a Street Fighter 2 cabinet working for $75.
6120000	6121000	God that's tempting.
6122000	6123000	Argh!
6123000	6125000	And they're in ranches so maybe they'll deliver it to you.
6126000	6127000	Maybe I don't know. Sorry.
6128000	6133000	I don't really have a lot of FUs of the week. I actually had like a really good week all things considered.
6134000	6140000	So I don't really have a lot of angsty stuff except maybe FU to being exhausted after work on Friday.
6141000	6144000	Like I just wanted to go home and die and I did. I slept for an hour so there you go.
6145000	6151000	And FU to the rain causing people to drive like crazy. It took twice as long to get here as it usually does.
6151000	6152000	Rawr!
6153000	6156000	Alright that's gonna do it for the FUs of the week. No story to inspire it tonight.
6157000	6159000	Everybody's been fairly well behaved out in the world.
6160000	6163000	Just a couple more stories and then we'll get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6164000	6166000	But first, some more stories. Loki.
6167000	6173000	Yes. They had an interesting, or there's gonna be an interesting update coming to Team Fortress 2.
6174000	6179000	But what's more interesting than the update itself is how they're deciding who will get the update.
6179000	6183000	Apparently the update is either gonna be for the Demoman or the Soldier.
6184000	6192000	And the way you get to choose, or at least have an impact on who gets the update, is by killing the other class.
6193000	6200000	That's right. So starting now, and I forget how long this is running, but I guess during the week,
6201000	6207000	you will be able to get the update for the Soldier by becoming the Soldier and killing the Demoman.
6207000	6212000	And if you want the Demoman to get the update, you need to go kill the Soldier as the Demoman.
6213000	6215000	So, that's kinda neat.
6216000	6220000	And it's apparently the, of course, the update's called The War.
6222000	6223000	That's kinda cool.
6224000	6230000	You know, Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that they have done a very good job supporting for quite some time since its release.
6231000	6232000	So, there you go.
6232000	6239000	Yeah, it says, also it says the update will award three new weapons to both the Soldier and Demoman classes.
6240000	6243000	Weapons will be revealed piecemeal over the course of next week.
6244000	6248000	However, two classes will be fighting during the week to unlock a secret fourth weapon for their profession.
6251000	6255000	Alright, moving on to one more story and then we'll get to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6255000	6262000	Hey, this has to do with Borderlands. Of course, this is kinda one of those games, I don't wanna say it's flying under the radar, so to speak,
6263000	6264000	but I think it fell off a lot of people's radars.
6265000	6266000	It's really sweet. I'm gonna play it this weekend.
6267000	6269000	It's doing very good, kinda like, you know, word of mouth and so forth.
6270000	6274000	And it's getting a second download content. It's called Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot.
6275000	6277000	And you can probably just even tell by the name.
6278000	6280000	It sounds a lot like it's inspired by Mad Max.
6280000	6287000	But what the game will do there is it's actually adding some new Riot mode arenas for single player and co-op.
6288000	6293000	There's gonna be a bank where you can store your weapons and the whole thing's gonna cost you 800 Microsoft points,
6294000	6296000	or that would be 10 real dollars and that's how much they're charging on the PS3.
6297000	6300000	They're saying also it's an entirely new game mode.
6301000	6306000	They're comparing it to Smash TV in co-op first person shooter in the Borderlands.
6307000	6308000	That does sound kind of awesome.
6308000	6309000	So there you go.
6310000	6312000	I like that. It's a salacious pop in our chatroom at chat.orangetonshooter.com.
6313000	6314000	Calls it a first person looter.
6315000	6316000	So there you go.
6317000	6321000	Alright, so we're gonna go ahead and open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR
6322000	6324000	where we will take your calls right now if you want to go ahead and give us a call.
6325000	6329000	By the way, I just want to say I followed up in chat to one of the emails
6330000	6333000	because I noticed that Derek from Dead Pixel Live was in the all games chat
6334000	6335000	while we were getting asked that question on the mailbag.
6335000	6340000	And he said that it is coming back at 7.30 on Monday after a brief cancellation.
6341000	6342000	So there you go.
6343000	6344000	So stay tuned to All Games Radio and check that out.
6345000	6350000	And I'm assuming 7.30 is Eastern because I know that show used to come on at like 3.30 Pacific.
6351000	6354000	It was kind of early for us over here so I think it's just going to be on at a slightly different time.
6355000	6356000	So check that out.
6357000	6359000	Alright, and of course for all the ladies you can always check allgames.com
6360000	6361000	for the latest goings on at All Games Radio.
6362000	6363000	Hey, we are getting some calls believe it or not.
6363000	6364000	Let's go to the phones and take them.
6365000	6366000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
6367000	6369000	Hi, guys. This is Spazinator.
6370000	6371000	Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind, buddy?
6372000	6382000	Yeah, I just want to comment on the little story that this guy said a little while ago about firmware update 3.15 for PS3.
6383000	6387000	Yeah, the latest update on PlayStation 3. Have you checked it out? Have you used it? What's up?
6387000	6398000	There's a slight pitch with the update. Even though the update on the PlayStation 3 is in place,
6399000	6407000	you can't use it for the full use of playing the minis on your PlayStation 3 just yet.
6408000	6412000	Yeah, we did note earlier when we were covering it that not all the games are playable.
6412000	6417000	I guess some of the newer ones and the sprinkling of the old ones you can do, but not all of the new ones.
6418000	6420000	I guess they're going to patch that in later or something, right?
6421000	6427000	Yeah, exactly. In fact, apart from you guys, a few of all the sites made note of this.
6428000	6439000	I guess that I don't have all the details in place just yet, so I didn't want to give out any bad information.
6439000	6449000	But I'm guessing that they're going to arrange stuff in such a way on the PlayStation Store
6450000	6459000	that make it easier to figure out which ones you keep playing on your PlayStation 3 as opposed to which ones that still haven't been updated.
6460000	6464000	Well, I'm hoping that they get them all playable before too long. I guess that's the idea, right?
6464000	6471000	Oh, yeah, really. The one thing I definitely want to get and play is Tetris.
6472000	6479000	I know it's available on virtually every console known to man, but Tetris is a classic game.
6480000	6485000	You buy Pac-Man lots of times for different consoles. It's just one of those classic games you have to have. I understand that.
6486000	6488000	Spaznier, let me ask you this, though, because this came up earlier in the show.
6488000	6493000	And I'm curious because I know you're a Sony fan and you follow a lot of their stuff. You've been very loyal to them throughout the years.
6494000	6499000	A question came up earlier in the show about, you know, PS1 games are playable on your PSP and your PlayStation 3.
6500000	6505000	Why aren't PSP games playable on your PlayStation 3? Do you think this is something that Sony should move towards?
6506000	6513000	Let's imagine that technically it's possible. Let's just throw the technical aspect out of it. Technically it's possible. Should Sony do it?
6513000	6530000	From a consumer standpoint, I'd say hell yeah. However, from a strictly business standpoint, I don't think it would make sense.
6531000	6539000	Because I would imagine from a Sony standpoint they would probably lose money, so it doesn't matter how you want to look at it.
6539000	6549000	I'm all for playing your games, you know, the PSP games on the PS3, but I, you know, I love things really, you know,
6550000	6554000	come through push, come through shove, you know. I really don't see it happening though.
6555000	6562000	I don't see it happening either, but it's too bad because I can also see the business standpoint of the fact that where it might not then motivate the sale of systems,
6562000	6568000	what it will motivate the sale of is the games. I mean, you know, and all the games that are available right there on the store for digital download,
6569000	6575000	there's some stuff I would freaking love to play on the PS3, like the Final Fantasy remakes, even though I don't think those are in the store yet,
6576000	6580000	but maybe like the Castlevania game that came out by Konami. You know, there's a lot of games I would love to play on the TV.
6581000	6588000	Although, you know, I know I could use a video out cable if I want to do that, but maybe I want the convenience of not having to do all that.
6588000	6600000	But, you know, on a somewhat related note, you know, one thing that I think virtually every time you can hear replacer demos would like to see is, you know,
6601000	6611000	somehow they really bring back PlayStation 2 back with compatibility. You know, I know the early models, you know, PlayStation 3 had it,
6611000	6624000	and they kind of reaped it out, and, you know, yeah, they're trying to tinker with it a little bit with the God of War collection and Call of Duty classics,
6625000	6631000	but, you know, I would love to be able to play all my old PlayStation 2 games all over again.
6632000	6636000	You know, it's interesting because that rumor kind of comes around every so often about the PlayStation 2 games, you know, being playable on PS3,
6636000	6642000	and I seem to remember not that long ago, maybe four or five months ago, we had that Sega leaked memo, remember that,
6643000	6648000	that had talked about not just the PlayStation 2 games but the Dreamcast games. Like, whatever happened with that, you know?
6649000	6653000	I thought that was something that was supposedly rumored for the end of the year. Maybe, you know, things change, obviously.
6654000	6660000	But, I mean, this PlayStation 2 being playable on PS3, this is not the first or the last time this rumor is going to come up.
6660000	6665000	It seems like it's just a matter of time before software backwards compatibility makes it possible.
6666000	6669000	But, anyway, Spaznator, we've got to let you go and get to some more calls, but any quick final thoughts for us?
6670000	6674000	Um, nothing. I can't think of. But, you know, thanks for taking my call, though.
6675000	6678000	All right, well, thank you. Of course. As always, Spaznator, you take care, buddy.
6679000	6684000	And, by the way, speaking of Spaznator, I know he's a big fan of the OLR Club on home, which filled up.
6684000	6689000	We maxed it out. 25 people's all you can have, so we got all the invites and that's it. We got a full club out there.
6690000	6691000	I can even join.
6692000	6693000	I know. Some of you guys didn't even join.
6694000	6695000	I don't go home.
6696000	6698000	Well, yeah, and sadly, not a lot of people do. We do need to set up a time to actually go on home and have a meeting, so maybe one of these days.
6699000	6700000	I'll just have to create Loki's porn hut.
6701000	6702000	And I'll kick anybody who doesn't show up.
6703000	6704000	I'll just have to create Loki's porn hut.
6705000	6707000	You do. You need to make Loki's porn hut. But, for now, we've got another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
6708000	6709000	Hey, hey, it's Ronma.
6710000	6711000	Hey, hey, what's up?
6711000	6717000	Thanks so much. Couple of things. I'll be on my merry little way. Number one, I just had my 360 replaced yet again.
6718000	6719000	Again? What happened?
6720000	6729000	I got the dreaded disk read error, and because Best Buy screwed up the first time around when exchanging my console, I got it replaced yet again.
6730000	6736000	I seem to remember something like this coming up a couple weeks ago about the whole Best Buy shenanigans, so they didn't put up too much of a fight in replacing it for you?
6736000	6743000	At first, the woman at the counter kept telling me that, um, it's out of warranty, you've got to send it in.
6744000	6750000	I'm having an argument with the telly app, two-year coverage. It was replaced once. I went replaced again. I still have time on it.
6751000	6761000	The customer service manager comes over. After she tells security, I attempted to jump over the counter and smack the living daylights out of her, which I'm just standing there looking at her like, what is your problem?
6762000	6763000	Wow.
6763000	6777000	So the customer service manager says, he had his whole Geek Squad blow it out with compressed air, which is something I already did. He says, take it home. If it works, it works. If not, bring it back and exchange it. So, I now have an Elite sitting on my counter.
6778000	6780000	How does blowing out a console fix a DVD drive?
6781000	6782000	Well, it works on Nintendo, I don't know.
6783000	6784000	I don't know, you tell me.
6785000	6791000	Wow. Alright, well, I guess, there you go. They finally got you one though, right?
6791000	6803000	Yeah, only thing, yeah. I had to swap out the hard drive. I'm sitting there like, well, I could take the 120-gig hard drive, come home with it, and my roommate would kill me because of all the saves, or I could just take the 60-gig, which I did.
6804000	6806000	What else is going on in your gaming world, Rama?
6807000	6814000	Not too much. I started back into playing Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass because I forgot where I left off at, so I'm starting from scratch.
6815000	6818000	Well, sometimes that's what you got to do. You got to start all over.
6818000	6826000	Yeah, but don't just hate that. You pick up an RPG after you haven't played it for a long time, and you're like, where the hell was I? Damn it, I have to go all over.
6827000	6838000	Yeah, I did that with Lost Odyssey. I was on the second disc or something, and then I went back and played it again. I got all the way to the third disc, and now it's been a few months since I played. If I wanted to go back, I'd probably have to start from the beginning again.
6838000	6848000	I will say, though, what little I've played of Dragon Age Origins, I do like, though, that whenever on the loading screen of Dragon Age Origins, it gives you a one-paragraph summary of where you are in the story.
6849000	6854000	I thought that was a really smart feature. It kind of reminds you of what's going on. I thought that was pretty cool.
6855000	6859000	Well, Rama, if there's nothing else on your mind, then I'll let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks so much for your call. Okay, buddy?
6859000	6872000	I have one thing, and I'll be on my way. I talked about Avatar earlier. I want to let everyone know that a friend of mine, Kyle Hebert, who's a voice actor, he's doing the playable character Ryuk for Avatar the Game for the Wii.
6873000	6878000	Well, maybe we'll have to get him on the show. I know there's another voice actor we're trying to get on the show, hopefully in the next couple weeks.
6879000	6881000	I will let him know, and let's see what happens with it.
6881000	6892000	Awesome. All right, take care, buddy. Later. 877-GAME-OLR, if you want to get through, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6893000	6904000	Toll-free in the U.S. and Canada, but if you're in another country besides those two, I would really urge you to use Skype because it's free, whereas you get charged for using toll-free numbers in non-North America countries.
6905000	6906000	Do we have any last-minute stories tonight, Loki?
6906000	6920000	Real quick, a few things on the Xbox 360 hacking scene. The two newer light-on drives that were unhackable before are now able to be dumped through a new method that they've figured out.
6920000	6936000	And also, they found out a way to hack Xbox Live Arcade games, and now they can register any game that they have a demo for, thanks to Yaris! Yaris made it possible, so there was some good for that game after all.
6937000	6939000	Interesting. So Yaris had some good come out of it after all.
6939000	6956000	Of course, it does require that you have a modded homebrew-enabled system, which requires a certain mod chip and a firmware prior to...well, you had to add previously a firmware prior to June of 09, and then you can upgrade it to a modified firmware.
6957000	6962000	But of course, that firmware you don't want to go on live with, but it can be possible.
6963000	6965000	Interesting. Anything else?
6965000	6968000	Uh, Beat Raiders coming to the iPhone. That's kinda neat, I guess.
6969000	6970000	Oh, that's the Timbaland game, right?
6971000	6972000	Yeah. And, uh...
6973000	6980000	Did you hear he collaborated with Miley Cyrus on the new album? Like, that's an odd pairing, isn't it? Timbaland and Miley Cyrus, for real?
6981000	6982000	Well, she's trying to become more edgy, I guess.
6983000	6986000	I guess. I don't know if I can believe that, but alright.
6989000	6990000	Is that it? That's all you got?
6991000	6992000	Yeah, that's all I got.
6992000	6996000	It was. I mean, when all was said and done, it wasn't a super busy Newsweek, so...
6997000	7002000	Dark Soccer, I'm gonna ask you if you have anything last minute, but usually you speak up if you do.
7003000	7004000	Ah! I'm not feeling well, Rob.
7005000	7007000	I'm sorry. Sorry to hear that. Hope you feel better.
7008000	7009000	I'm feeling lightheaded.
7010000	7011000	Oh, no. Well, maybe you need to go lie down and take a nap.
7012000	7012000	Maybe.
7013000	7018000	Well, the good news is, then I suppose for you, is that the show is just about done here. It doesn't look like we're getting any more calls, which...
7018000	7022000	There's a lot of shy chatters tonight. We got some people going, should I call in? I don't know.
7023000	7025000	And I'm like, well, call in if you have something to say, but the phone's not going off, so...
7026000	7031000	Well, the good news is, cause I ordered my pasta for, you know, cause I gotta go on the way home.
7032000	7033000	Is that for you and the wife?
7034000	7039000	It's for us and our guests that we have. We have our friend that just had their baby back in May.
7040000	7041000	Oh, very cool.
7041000	7050000	And so, I gotta go over there, but the pasta's not due to be done until 5.20, so that gives us 20 minutes if we want to break out some bayonetta.
7051000	7052000	Works for me.
7053000	7060000	I have to do that. But we're gonna go ahead and wrap up the show for now. Rama's pointing out in chat, by the way, Sky, Timbaland worked with Utada's first US album.
7061000	7065000	I actually know that. I don't hate Utada's first US album.
7065000	7071000	Like, I don't think it's like, OMG, greatest thing ever, but it's not bad as a piece of pop music. It's fine.
7072000	7078000	I think it was underrated, I think, by a lot of people. But yeah, if you're a fan of Timbaland, Utada's first US album, I'm looking forward to seeing her live.
7079000	7081000	That's gonna be a rare opportunity in January, so woohoo!
7082000	7090000	Anyhow, we're gonna go around and wrap it up. I know it's a little bit of a short show tonight, but it's been kind of a weird week, and also, right before Christmas, not a lot going on.
7090000	7095000	You know, people are just getting ready for the holidays and all that stuff, you know, which actually already started with Hanukkah.
7096000	7101000	It kind of kicks off the holiday season, and of course you have all the other stuff, so it really goes on through New Year's Day.
7102000	7106000	So things will pick up again as we get into next year and all the crazy releases. Doesn't mean we're going anywhere, though.
7107000	7113000	We will be back, of course, live on the 19th next Sunday right after Bobby, our usual time slot. We'll be there doing all that we usually do.
7114000	7116000	So now we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts. DarkSakura?
7117000	7118000	I'm tired.
7118000	7120000	Sorry to hear that. Loki?
7121000	7133000	I can't wait to eat the pasta. We got the meaty pasta, and this is a shock, but I'm proud to be married to my wife. She wanted the bacon macaroni and cheese.
7134000	7135000	I'm like, yes!
7136000	7138000	Yeah, wish your wife a happy Hanukkah for me, by the way. If you wouldn't mind doing that.
7138000	7148000	And I guess I don't really have much of a final thought, but hail Godga. That's my final thought. Hail Godga, because it's the whole reason the show's getting screwed up tonight, so appreciate it.
7149000	7154000	That's it. Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio. We really appreciate it.
7155000	7160000	You know, we do the show for free, and all we ask, if you enjoy what you've heard, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word.
7161000	7165000	Word of mouth's all we got. We don't have a big, big magazine or anything that backs us up. It's just us.
7165000	7167000	We do accept donations.
7168000	7173000	We will be back, though, next. Yes, donations of money and food. Cookies are good. Macaroons.
7174000	7176000	I just gave Rob the last of my macaroons.
7177000	7182000	They were delicious, by the way. Anyhow, that's going to do it. Thank you guys so much. We'll do it all again next week on the 19th.
7183000	7187000	So, until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're gone!
