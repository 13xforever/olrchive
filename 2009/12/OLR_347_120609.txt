December 6, 2009.
Steam is about to get some more competition.
Could you soon play PSP Minis on your PS3?
And a long-lasting video game rumor is revealed to be true this week.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that video game talk show dedicated to, of course, video games.
Video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and food!
Lots and lots of food!
And crushing!
Nom nom nom.
and Yarn.
A third crocheting because I don't have the patience for that stuff.
And you've crocheted, by the way, of course, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers and I'm Rob Roberts.
I'm making a hat.
And he's Techmaster Loki.
Why not just introduce him too?
How you doing, Techmaster Loki?
I'm doing fine.
Amazing.
Okay, so crocheting.
I don't have the patience for that.
Okay.
Just saying.
I didn't think I did either, but it's actually fairly therapeutic.
I sit in front of my computer and chat with Becky or whoever else is on.
And watch random YouTubage?
No.
Well, sometimes I'll watch other people crocheting while I crochet.
It's sort of like eating food while you're watching the Food Network or watching porn while you fuck.
Or in my case, watching The Biggest Loser while eating a giant pizza.
That's what I like to do.
It makes me feel good about myself.
Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?
How's your week going?
It's okay.
Arcade Cabinet, I guess.
Sort of.
Bartop Cabinet.
That looks ghetto.
There's pictures of it at OrangeLawnRadio.com.
It's awesome, though.
No, it's ghetto awesome.
Yes.
So there's something... I don't know what happened with it.
It was something because I had wired up the analog stick to the directional...
Joystick that I had.
And there's a way you can do it.
It's pretty easy.
And the contact points are a lot bigger than trying to solder to the small, really tiny ribbon cable solder points that are for the actual digital directional pad.
So I figured, okay, I'll just solder to that.
Well, something happened, and I'm not sure what.
I thought I bridged something, but apparently that wasn't the case.
And for whatever reason, it just... The PSP seemed like it was only pressing down.
And it just consistently held down, down.
So that made it hard to kind of select games, play anything, because, you know, it'd be always pressing down.
So I figured, okay, I'm gonna look at and see what I did solder-wise, and I...
Thanks for watching!
I'm just going to kind of take a break from it right now because there's not much I can really do with it.
Well, it's got to be frustrating that you build this whole machine and then it just, oops.
Well, yeah, it was all ready to go.
I had some trouble like earlier in the week.
I couldn't get it to stay powered on and that I realized was a mistake because I had hooked up a push button backwards so it was hooked to the normally open instead of the normally closed.
and you know that causes it to basically when the button's not being pressed to be the button is pressed and then when you push the button the button isn't pressed so it's kind of backwards and once I fixed that it worked just fine powered up you know everything was hunky-dory and then you know I tested what buttons worked and what didn't and apparently my
R button didn't really work, which I'm guessing is because the solder point was super tiny, so I probably missed it when I was soldering.
And my triangle button wasn't working, which I didn't really even get to the point to fix that yet.
And then the constantly pressing down thing, which was kind of annoying.
Thanks for watching!
Not quite everything yet, but there's a lot of it that's salvageable.
And honestly, if I want to try again, I mean, PSPs are dirt cheap.
If I look on Craigslist, I can get one sub 50 bucks.
Nice.
You know, if I want to do that.
And at the same time, I actually figured out a way requiring an extra device to be purchased.
But there is a way that's actually super easy to do that.
And not only will I be able to use the PSP in the arcade cabinet...
Wow.
It doesn't matter anyways, because I will have a working bar top cabinet.
I love that you just haven't totally given up.
It'll come back stronger.
PSP Cabinet 2.0.
Bigger and better.
At the same time, it was kind of a learning experience, because now I know how to solder slightly better.
Not enough to where I need to solder these...
Really small wires onto these contacts, and it was just, it was a mess.
It was super delicate, I mean, there was so much that could have gone wrong, and a lot of it did, and it was just, it wasn't pretty.
So, the second time around will be a lot better, and a lot cleaner, and should work.
But, when I actually get around to that, I don't know, because I have a lot of things I gotta work on, so.
It will not be forgotten.
It will be taken care of at some point.
Plus, it's just a busy time of year.
This isn't the best time to start a big project.
Well, I have other projects.
I tend to start projects when I have other projects going and don't finish things.
I have my arcade cabinet, the actual arcade cabinet, that I've got everything almost ready for that.
I was just working on the front end to get some of the themes I had for a hyper-spin to work correctly.
Otherwise, it's ready to go.
So I may just play around with that, actually enjoy the fruits of my labor.
and then later on, you know, tackle this stuff.
Actually, for whatever reason on Impulse Buy, I purchased what they call a Dingo A320, which, you know, it's not an actual Dingo, but it's a little...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I probably could turn that into a cabinet as well if I wanted to in place of this because I could hook up the video out to an old PS1 LCD monitor that I have still, so maybe.
But then again, you know, it's pretty nice and I don't want to kind of mess that up, so I'll just probably get another PSP and just do it.
I'll fix it this time.
But other than that, you know, that's pretty much what I've been doing other than, you know, grant the thought and stuff.
Alright.
Well, I was going to get into Gaming Weeks, but you pretty much took the cake with that one.
That's alright.
Let's go over to Jamie.
How was your Gaming Week, DarkSakura?
I played World of Warcraft and knitted.
Or crocheted.
Watch Dan play Borderlands.
I watched a little bit of that.
I'm not super familiar with Borderlands, although I've heard a lot of good things about it.
And I was watching Dan play a little bit of it as I was walking in tonight.
I like the Crazy Mutant Midgets.
Is that what they're actually called?
Yes, the Crazy Mutant Midgets or something like that.
Amazing.
Loki, was there anything else for your gaming week?
I know you're talking about hacks, but other games you've been playing?
Just Grand Theft Auto.
That's pretty much it.
All the opportunity that I had to play games this weekend, I was just too busy working on that stupid box cabinet thing.
Nice.
Let's see, My Gaming Week.
Two new games.
One, just a demo, so I can't really tell you about the game.
But the demo I played was Bayonetta.
And didn't know a whole lot about the game.
I kind of knew it was like a Devil May Cry-ish game with a hot chick as the main character.
It's awesome.
But I didn't know a whole lot about it.
But one of my friends was like, no, you really, really need to play this demo.
It's quite astounding.
And I was like, okay, I'll check it out.
What have I got to lose?
I'm not paying anything for it.
So...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's so over the top.
I was laughing and laughing and laughing.
And just this move where you spin the controller like 360 degrees and hit one of the buttons and then she'll get on the ground and start... Her high heels are guns.
So she starts shooting from her high heels and you can actually aim at the monsters.
It is insanity and I loved every minute of it.
So I am so excited for the full version of the game because it was just so over the top.
And some of the boss fights were extremely silly.
I...
I can't believe how much I enjoyed this game because it's not usually the type of game I'm all into, but just the absurdness and over-the-topness and the design of the characters.
I can see why now this game is getting all the praise it is.
I had a good time.
And by the way, did you notice she's wearing her hair?
Her hair is like her weapon.
Yes.
And she turns her hair into demons that will bite the heads off of monsters.
She has witch hair.
Which conveniently leaves her with a naked booty.
Or a thong or something.
Who would win in a fight, Bayonetta or the Baroness?
I would have to say Bayonetta is going to just kick her into a guillotine and snap her fingers and it's over.
So, you know, with all due respect to the Baroness.
I guess they're saying in chat room, TigerClaw says, Bayonetta looks like the Baroness.
And if you want to join us in our chat, chat.orangelawntrader.com, of course, is always a place you can do that.
And I really do need to play that game because I have my...
My Japanese 360 now.
And I actually do have the game.
I just haven't played it yet because I've been working on Crapply.
You really need to play it and seriously call me when you do because I want to hear your initial impressions before next week's show.
You need to bring it over.
Yeah, I want to play the full one.
Looks like fun.
Alright, anyhow, also my gaming week.
Not a demo, but a full game, and one I've been intending to play for a while.
New Super Mario Bros.
Wii, which was a game I played at E3, and I was kind of like, yeah, it's okay.
I played it with one of the nice booth babes there who was trying to show me the parts of the game and obviously I was getting into the multiplayer experience and I was like, yeah, it's okay.
But I wish that they would go back.
And I said this on the show a couple weeks ago.
I said, I really want them to go back and make like Super Mario Bros.
4 or something like that.
Like a game like the old Mario Bros.
that kind of, without all this extra frilly stuff that they've kind of done in some of the more recent Mario releases and 3D and all that stuff.
And
I have to admit, I was wrong.
This is that game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And as I heard Bobby mention on his show, of course, Bobby Blackwolf's always on before we are at All Games Radio when we broadcast live on Sunday nights.
He was kind of talking about how there wasn't really a tutorial mode.
So if you've never played a Mario game before, there's a lot of stuff you miss.
And I kind of agree with that.
Like if the game has one flaw, it was that I didn't know you could hit the A button to avoid death in multiplayer mode until...
A little ways into it, playing with friends.
And I suppose the discovery of it was okay.
But yeah, I would have liked, since this is supposed to be something for everyone, there to be a little more of a basic tutorial mode.
But honestly, that's a very minor flaw in what is otherwise a stellar game and just a really fun multiplayer experience with a lot of variety.
There's some new suits, like the propeller suit and the penguin suit.
And now you have ice balls as well as fireballs.
And
Thanks for watching!
Really happy for this game.
Reading some comments from chat.
Zappy says, I guess Sky never played New Super Mario Bros.
on the DS.
Actually, that's not true.
I did play it on the DS.
But you have to kind of go back and remember that I have an extreme bias against handheld games.
Especially when they are porting over games that I remember from consoles.
And I am the first to admit, it's completely irrational and stupid.
But I don't like games I remember from my television playing big on my big sound speaker, larger than life.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Let's see, trying to look for some other questions from chat.
Let's see.
Again, if you want to join our chat, chat.orangelongeradio.com.
And I think they're talking about some other games.
They're talking about Tekken and stuff in chat right now, which I did not play during my gaming week.
But between those couple games and a little bit of other things here and there, not a whole lot of other major games this week, but I really enjoyed Super Mario Bros.
Wii.
And you know what's weird?
Because...
Every time... I know we've given Nintendo a hard time on this show.
And we've come on here and we've said, you know, Nintendo is so out of touch with gaming, they don't, you know, they're not getting it, and Microsoft and Sony are doing all these things online that are, you know, miles ahead of what the Wii is doing.
But then, damn, they always release a game like this that really reminds you they do know how to do fun.
It's just that, unfortunately, it's...
You only get a couple of these releases a year that kind of remind you of that fact.
But I do recommend the game, especially if you played Mario 1 growing up.
If you have that same desire I have, God, I wish they'd make a game like Mario 3 or Mario World again.
This is that game.
And then there's multiplayer in it to boot that's actually kind of fun.
Except for the fact that the princess isn't in it, but she got kidnapped again.
What can you do?
DarkSakura.com
Let's see.
Comment from chat.
Ricky Go Max says, I would play that.
Peach's Quest.
You know, there was a game like that on DS.
Speaking of DS and everything.
There was a Princess Peach game.
Super Princess Peach, wasn't it called?
It was different, though.
It wasn't really a Mario game.
See, that was one of those Nintendo trying to take a Mario thing.
It was okay, but it wasn't Mario Brothers.
It was Super PMS.
Yeah, she used her emotions.
I remember the emotions was a big part of that game.
A little silly.
So anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
Some housekeeping I wanted to state.
We will not be live next week.
We will not have a live show next week, and that's completely my fault.
I'm going to be out of town next Sunday.
It's really no secret I'm going to see Lady Gaga in concert, and I couldn't be more excited.
So sorry, guys.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Ask All Games if we can go live.
So stay tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook.
Twitter.com slash OLR and Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
And of course our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com for the details on when that pre-taping will happen.
So again, if you are used to coming here Sunday nights and listening, you're still going to get a new show next week.
You will hear a new show Sunday night.
It just won't be live.
And, you know...
Thank you for watching!
So starting things off, this is kind of interesting, but not too surprising.
Games for Windows Live, they've decided to add Games on Demand.
You may remember that's a service that's been available right now on Xbox Live as their kind of digital download service.
And of course, trying to compete with Steam a little bit, I think, they're going to start doing their Games on Demand service starting the beginning of December 15th.
and apparently some of the games that they're talking about adding for the initial lineup is going to be Resident Evil 5, Red Faction Guerrilla, Battle Stations Pacific, as well as some Game for Windows Live enabled versions of World of Goo and Osmos.
Hmm.
And...
I don't know, that's kind of interesting.
They haven't really said any prices yet on what the games will cost.
Well, I imagine a lot of it's going to be competitively priced or similar to what you see on store shelves.
That's pretty much what we've come to expect from Steam.
But I think a large reason people really like Steam is that they do sales all the freaking time.
And if I remember correctly, I believe, isn't Games for Windows Live kind of tied in with Windows 7 a little bit?
Because I remember when they were showing us some of the stuff for Windows 7, there was kind of that game marketplace or whatever that you could download, like a bunch of casual stuff and whatnot.
I just upgraded to 7 a week ago.
Well...
I've been running it on my laptop because remember we got the release candidate at E3 like many of you out there on the internet downloaded so I've been running that on my laptop for some time ever since I got it in July and that's what made me decide that I like Windows 7 I like it much more than the jump from XP to Vista because what I liked about 7 is it takes the best parts of Vista and what you remember liking about XP kind of puts it together the one thing I don't like about 7 is I cannot stand these administrator privileges things I want to freaking get them removed
It's the one thing I didn't... It's in Vista too.
Yeah, I know.
I didn't like it in Vista either.
There should be a way I can disable that crap.
You can't disable it.
Can you?
Well, in Vista, all you have to do is make yourself full administrator and then just do...
It took me a while to change it, to find where to change it, but it is there.
It should be there.
To be fair, I haven't looked hard enough, and I'm sure our chat room is going to light up with comments on things I could be doing better in a minute here.
And I'll have to look into that in the next week.
But I was just having problems because it was not letting me delete World of Warcraft folders because it said I didn't create them.
And I had to go in this really – like I had to right-click on the folder, go into properties, make myself the new owner.
It was ridiculous.
I should just be able to hit the delete key and nuke the fucking folder.
I should not have to jump hurdles to delete my own goddamn game.
You know?
It's stupid.
That's the one drawback.
Otherwise, I love Windows 7.
And to be fair, Vista has a lot of that administrative... So, you know what?
Just run Linux Mint, Rob.
I'm not going to run Linux Mint on a desktop.
I'd run it on my laptop, but running that stuff on my desktop, I can't do it.
It will run more efficiently...
On a laptop?
No.
I can't.
It runs more efficiently.
Why don't you run it on your desktop then?
Because I actually have to have programs that use a Windows environment.
Well, I use a lot of movie makers and stuff like that that's Windows environment.
So, you know, that's where I'm coming from.
You know, for a laptop though, like, you know, I kind of like... Mint 8's out now.
I know you're not a big fan of Google Chrome, but I like where that's headed as far as a laptop OS goes.
That it's just the internet, the documents, the stuff you want to do on the go.
But I could never... God, Google Chrome, I could never run on a desktop.
I don't think that it's actually meant for desktop use though.
I don't think so either.
But Mint is fairly versatile.
In fact, actually the other thing that I was going to be doing with my computer when the semester's over is actually doing a second install for Mint 8 because I was going to run some of the Windows emulated environments because apparently they actually run pretty well using less system resource than Vista or Windows 7 does.
Hmm.
So, actually, all those 5 gigs of RAM, I can actually use it for my graphics programs.
You know, I might give it a try.
I am not a fan of Windows.
I use it out of necessity.
And lately, I've been even less of a fan of macOS.
Yeah, there's things I really, really like about the Mac, and there's things I really, really don't like about the Mac.
Me too.
Well, it's one thing that I've actually been pretty happy that finally Adobe has gotten their crap together and made CS4 actually really, really wonderfully compatible with a PC environment.
It's got everything optimized for your graphics cards.
I can run Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Corel Painter and the internet and AIM and all this other crap at the same time without my system just farting.
Nice.
So...
All right.
And just another quick note, because I see a lot of chatter saying that they're hearing a lot of typing.
I think something's up with Jamie's mic tonight, and it's more sensitive than usual, which is strange, because we didn't change any of the dials.
But, you know, things happen when things get shifted around.
So I think it's just ultra sensitive tonight.
And I've been typing on the microphone.
No.
So I'm just saying, we know you guys are hearing it, we just don't know why.
So one of the beauties of live radio is that sometimes we have to figure things out on the fly.
It's the whole newsroom vibe, okay?
Yes.
It's the typewriters.
Live for the OLR newsroom.
Yeah, we just totally need to have the Morse code ticker going in the background.
Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow.
Anyhow, sorry, going back to games for Windows Live, because damn, we got on a whole tangent about Windows 7.
The point I was trying to get to earlier, I've been running Windows 7 for months now and I haven't seen it.
There was the point I was trying to make seven minutes ago.
Anyway, the other thing I wanted to say, though, about this, Loki, I don't think you really use any of this stuff.
Do you even have a Steam account?
No.
Nope.
No, I figured.
Why would you have a Steam account?
Why would I pay for software?
I don't know.
Call it supporting developers, maybe?
I don't know.
Call me crazy.
Honestly, I don't play enough PC games to have that.
Final Fantasy XI is the last PC game I remember you actually playing more than an hour of.
I played Crysis and Spore.
Actually, the last Games for Windows live game that I purchased was Grand Theft Auto 4 for the PC.
Oh, okay.
And I actually stopped playing that because I got tired of trying to monkey with stuff to get it to... I don't know why games nowadays, some of them don't support multiple graphics cards.
And it's really sad that they don't.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You don't buy computers.
You build computers.
No, I should have built the goddamn computer.
It was $800, and I was like, oh, this is a great deal.
It's got like six gigs of RAM.
I'm like, I can't build one that cheap.
I was stupid.
You can.
Bad judgment.
I admit it.
How dare I doubt the great and mighty Loki, and I pay for it every day of my life.
I just built...
Lesson learned.
I just built a PC for my mom, actually.
It's sadly almost, well, not quite up to spec to what mine is, because mine was built for gaming, but $350.
It gets incredibly cheap to do it nowadays.
If you actually go piece by piece of what they actually include in there, you can see where they're cutting corners.
Well, I need a new video card, because Dragon Age kind of runs like balls on my computer, but then I watched my friend play it on his computer this weekend, and it's like, oh, beautiful.
And you can do rotating and things that you can't do on the console.
So I'm like, must play Dragon Age.
This game is beautiful.
And I can't.
Because my video card is balls because I didn't trust Loki.
Anyhow.
Well, that'll be the last time they do that.
Akira Yamaoka Akira Yamaoka
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
OutSourced it, or well, not outsourced it, but had a US developer do Homecoming or what have you.
And I don't know, maybe that's part of what ticked him off.
I have no idea.
Or maybe, you know, after 16 years he wanted a new job.
That he just doesn't get along with people from what I understand.
Really?
Well... He was nice at E3 that one year we randomly met him.
Yeah, he was pretty cool.
And I mean, I was like, ha ha ha.
But anyway... In your pants.
But seriously, I just, you know, maybe he just got tired of dealing with all the crap going on.
And we don't know.
We can speculate until the cows come home, but we don't know.
There's been no official statement made.
But you also look at it and go, okay, he was there for, what, 16 years?
I mean, that's a long time to be at any job.
And sometimes people just want to change.
Maybe he's doing that whole thing where it's like, okay, I've been with this band, and now I want to split off and make a solo album.
And...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And he scored things even all the way back to the 8-bit days.
I know he did the Contra game that was on... He did some of Super Contra's soundtrack, I think.
He's just done a lot of stuff over the years.
I'm sure the wiki has the whole list about that.
We wish him the best.
Good luck to Akira Yamaoka.
And again, we would really like to see you form a new studio and make some more scary games.
He should hire me.
He should.
He should.
He should hire me, too.
I am particularly crazy enough to be able to help with the whole Silent Hill... Anyway.
You just want to be raped by Pyramid Head.
No.
No.
Not just no, but no.
Ew.
One does not just ask Pyramid Head to rape them.
Besides that, he has... You have to be chosen by Pyramid Head.
Besides that, he only bones the monsters.
Ah, I see.
I'm not a nurse.
Sorry.
Well, how about some game banning?
or not.
This is stupid.
Yeah, so the Australian classification board says that Sega can't have it for Aliens vs. Predators.
That means that they actually cannot sell it in Australia the way it is now.
It's...
They're saying that because you've got human beings being tortured and violated and decapitated and dismembered and lots of stabbing through different parts of the body that no.
They said no.
And Sega Australia is like, we're going to still appeal it.
because this is kind of stupid.
Well, and that's just what you do when your game gets a bad rating.
I mean, have we ever heard a game company ever in the history of this show, you know, XY game gets banned and the company says, ah, okay, well, you know, these things happen.
Well, we try it.
That's right.
Nope, cancel it.
Merry Christmas to you now.
Oh well.
Oh well.
Happy Christmas.
That's a ballsy thing to do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, one thing I got to see this week was the Left 4 Dead.
You know, it's on YouTube.
If you go look for the Left 4 Dead 2, you can look at the censored version in Australia and kind of compare it to the regular one.
And, man, you guys in Australia got shafted on Left 4 Dead 2.
It's like the zombies, like, disappear.
Like, I was waiting for the bodies to flicker before they disappear, like it was Double Dragon or something.
I mean, it was not pleasant how desanitized they had to make that game.
It's unfortunate.
Do you still want to...
It's like the dingo ate my decapitation scenes.
Do you still want to go over there?
What, to Australia?
Yeah.
Well, I want to go visit.
But you don't want to live there.
That's because I have an unhealthy obsession with a lot of Australian movies over the years.
And I want to see somebody play a didgeridoo.
Did I tell you I saw someone play a didgeridoo at school?
It's not authentic if it's not in Australia.
Just like if you have a pineapple here, it's not the same as having a pineapple in Hawaii.
I'm sorry.
But he built it out of PVC pipe.
That's not a didgeridoo.
But it sounded right and the guy was sitting outside at school.
That's a PVC redo or something.
PVC redo.
Didgeridoo.
I took a picture of it too.
It was funny.
Wow, wow, wow.
Well, look, people, you know what?
If this game comes out on PC, which almost all these games do nowadays, what's going to stop them from just importing the PC version of the game?
I mean, do they region lock out PC games?
I don't think that's a very easy thing to do.
No, you can't.
There is no regions.
You can if it runs on a DVD.
Oh, I guess that makes sense.
But isn't Australia... Australia's in the same region as Britain though, right?
But you can't... No, if it's on DVD, DVD video only has regions.
DVD software does not have regions at all.
So there's no way to lock out anything.
I guess maybe because we're thinking like PS2 would do the region lockouts, but of course that's different.
Interesting.
Yeah, and even if they did, it would just get bypassed so easy it's not even worth it.
Somebody in the chat room, of course, made the reference to Didgeridoo Techno.
I was an inside joke on this show from like a year and a half ago, but maybe we'll have to play that on break tonight.
It's been a little while.
And don't forget the references to Kylie.
We haven't had Didgeridoo Techno in a while.
We should play some Kylie during the break.
We'll see.
I had an old school chiptune song all picked out, but we'll see.
We'll see.
Anyhow, we're going to move on with more news.
Sorry, Australia.
You should write your legislators and tell them they're crap.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So there's a rumor that by the end of the year actually, or I guess near future, you're going to be able to play your PSP minis on your PlayStation 3.
So there's basically kind of...
I don't know, you can look at it two ways.
One, they're allowing you more customers, I guess, to purchase these PSP minis, which is neat that they would allow you to be able to play it.
Two, they don't have very much confidence in the PlayStation portable platform in order to...
PSP Minis are not up to expectations right now.
Um, maybe because the PlayStation Portable, I mean, the PSP Go's, I mean, obviously are all digital.
Most people with PSPs probably aren't really interested in download games, whereas, you know, they're more interested in kind of the retail stuff, because that way if they don't like it, they can send it back, or they can rent it, or they can try it out, and that kind of stuff.
And maybe just some of these games, like, you know,
Tetris they put out there.
I mean, who hasn't played Tetris and really do it?
Here's one reason why the PSP minis.
Here's my proof on why the PSP minis is doing well.
And here's a game you can play along with at home.
You ready?
Okay.
Quick.
Name one PSP minigame that's been released that wasn't Sudoku or Tetris.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know.
Oh, that's why they're not doing well.
Because there's nothing of note.
XNA Lacrosse Game PSP Minis
I've got to mention this that's come up in our chat because it's not on the show roll tonight but it's something I have to bring up because I really want to hear what Loki has to say to this.
Salacious Poppin Chat says there was some sort of Logitech rumor this week about them considering making a UMD add-on for the Go.
And they already denied it.
Have they denied it?
Yeah.
Let's imagine.
Let's go to the land of make-believe with King Friday and everybody for a minute and imagine that this rumor were true.
What would you be saying?
That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.
Yes, let me buy a more expensive system that's like almost $100 more expensive than the actual normal system, which includes this peripheral.
And then buy an additional peripheral to be able to have the same features as the cheaper system.
So you're asking me to spend more money for the system initially and more money on top of that to buy a feature that should have been there in the first place.
Sure, sign me up.
My reply to that would be, but meow meow this.
I see what you did there.
Yes, you did.
And like half of our listeners aren't even going to get it because they didn't watch Mr. Rogers Neighborhood.
No, plenty more are not going to understand what you just did, but I laughed very hard.
Rob, that was for your benefit.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
And Rob, I think that's so meow meow stupid.
I think this show should simply exist to amuse me.
Otherwise, what the hell are we doing?
We're just wasting our goddamn time.
We do this show every week so you can bring me coffee.
I was hoping that Logitech rumor was true, because it would just be the nice bullet point to the failure of the PSP Go.
It's like, and there's the ribbon for the package of failure right there.
And that's what they should call the add-on, Logitech package of failure for the PSP Go.
Well, you already spent the money already, so apparently you're going to buy extra crap for it as well.
I didn't know how to respond to that.
What were you going to say?
or you could just, I don't know give up on the UMD format as a format for movies since they've stopped making them anyways
I don't know, I never really saw any reason to... Because I already have that on Laserdisc somewhere.
And you know what?
You know why the PSP minis suck?
It's because they've already had the PSP download games already.
There was absolutely no need to add PSP minis as another form of download games.
Well, I like the idea of cheaper games, just so we don't have anything of note.
Now, to be fair...
Thanks for watching!
I got nothing.
There's just nothing very of note.
And I do feel bad for the Sony fans.
Well, no, I don't.
But we habitually bash the PSP Go on this show.
But honestly, Sony, it's just time to give the PSP Go an abortion.
I realize it's already out of the womb, but just stuff it in the face with a pillow and end the PSP Go.
Because the PSP is a great system.
Go back to the 3.
It's great.
PSP's great, it's all it's internet, mp3s, movies all right there, it's great just stop it with the go stop it and it wouldn't have been that hard to I mean seriously all they would have had to do is make a PSP 4000 or whatever and have internal storage built into it so okay look we've got an internal drive and all the same features that you liked before and that would have been just fine
Brad from PopCulture asked an interesting question in chat.
How is the add-on any different than a cart adapter for the GameCube or SNES?
Well, in both those cases, you were taking portable systems and putting them on your TV.
And I think that was the point of those.
Whereas this Logitech adapter is taking something that they took away and putting it back because you realized it never should have been gone in the first place.
If that makes any sense, I don't know I think that's the difference to me To be fair, those other adapters on the GameCube were a little silly as well Although the Super Game Boy did let you tweak the colors Silly, superficial things that weren't there to begin with At least something But at least, I don't know It's sort of like the HD DVD add-on to the Xbox 360
Something that they could have put in at launch, but they didn't.
And no one's missing it now.
We'll see.
I mean, maybe, again, in a year's time, we'll be singing a different tune, but I still think the PSP Go by that time will be... I think if they literally put this out, first off, it would have been Sony putting this out, not Logitech, although I can see why they do Logitech, so that way they wouldn't look as bad.
It would still be bad enough.
And right there, it's just like, oh, look, you don't have confidence in your system.
And how the hell would they manage to hack that?
And let's just say, for argument's sake, they were able to, I don't know...
Make that device and have it connect to their memory card slot or something like that to read UMDs.
It would be hacked in seconds and it would be a big old backdoor to the whole PSP Go.
It's not going to end up pretty for them.
Which is why they need to do it.
So that people can hack the Go even easier.
DarkSakura had a game of the week once.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
And I know Jamie's probably all over that, assuming it doesn't suck.
Although it looks like it might be fun.
It looks like it's like four players.
That could be kind of chaotic.
If four players are going at the grid all at once, that could be interesting.
That could be.
That's probably its big thing.
It probably has online, everybody kind of attacks it all at once.
Could be cool.
Well, how about something that we kind of already knew?
Hmm.
Yeah, so you know the rumor was going on for a long time that a lot of the music in Sonic 3 had been done by Michael Jackson?
Yes, I've heard that rumor before because the credits music sounds like Stranger in Moscow, right?
And Casino Night from Scream, the same thing.
Ah, that's right.
Yeah, the little triplet part.
But anyway, yeah.
So it was confirmed that he did it, but he was not happy with it.
So he wanted himself uncredited and the music altered.
But he, of course, kept a lot of the same elements to use in his own music.
That's kind of a bummer for Sega, because imagine if they could have marketed that Sonic 3 had a Michael freaking Jackson soundtrack.
I mean, that would have been huge for them.
I mean, it's not like Sonic 3 was a little game anyway, but there'd be a lot of people that would have taken a huge interest in this game knowing that Michael Jackson had been involved.
There's also, I actually remember there being interviews ahead of time that they said that they were getting Michael Jackson's involvement for the musical direction on one of the games.
Because, I mean, that was in a magazine back when.
Yeah.
but the whole point was that, and this is a quote from actually an interview with Michael Jackson's composer Brad Buxer saying that at the time, this is a quote, at the time game consoles did not allow optimal sound reproduction and Michael found it frustrating he did not want to be associated with a product that devalued his music so what about Moonwalker, huh?
Well, Moonwalker was kind of a rat in the arcades.
I mean, at the time.
Now you look back and go, this is something better left in my memory.
It came out on Genesis?
That's true.
I thought it was a pretty good rendition of Smooth Criminal.
Now, Salacious Pop was thinking what I was thinking.
At least there's always Space Channel 5 with Space Michael.
Space Channel 5.
By the way, have you ever heard this?
And I think this is the right YouTube.
I came across this earlier this week when I was reading about the story.
I've actually got one that I can link you.
Do you?
Okay.
Have you heard this hybrid one that's actually the credits and Michael Jackson, Stranger in Moscow over each other?
I'll play a little clip of this here.
Yes, I have heard that.
By the way, I do think the Sonic 3 credit music is some of the best video game music from that era.
So it is pretty neat to know that Michael Jackson indeed had something to do with that.
Oh yeah, the Ice Cap Zone thing, huh?
I'm going to link it to you right now.
Alright, let's try to get this played here and then we'll move on with another story.
In fact, while I load that up, maybe we'll start moving into release dates this week.
Loki, why don't you start off with the US releases and then we'll come back to this.
This week's not a lot coming out.
Pretty much your big game is going to be The Saboteur, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
Also this week, though, we do have one, I guess, well, apparently now one of the last Akira Yamaoka Silent Hill games, Silent Hill Shattered Memories, coming out on the Wii this week.
I have to pick that up.
I really like that at E3.
I hope it doesn't disappoint.
No, it looks freaking awesome.
Yeah, well, Nintendogs looked awesome too.
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah, but Nintendogs was awesome.
It's just, unfortunately, we didn't get to play it longer than five minutes at E3.
So, you know...
We thought it was good for longer than five, but really it was only good for five.
Of course, this week, Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on the DS.
And then there's some small crap that's littering the rest of the week.
Rec Room for the Wii, Puzzler World for the DS, which is a puzzle minigame compilation.
James Cameron's Avatar The Game out on PSP because I believe it's delayed from the rest of them and and that's about it actually alright let me go back to those YouTubes real quick before I get into the Japanese releases let's see this is the Who Is It mixed with Ice Cap Zone music?
yeah oops I still have my wave muted live radio fail
Carameldansen
Dude, I like this.
It's kind of neat.
It's so cool now that that game just has so much added value.
Even though this is kind of one of those things everybody always suspected anyway, but I think a lot of people were like, did Michael Jackson rip off Sonic because it was one of his favorite?
But now it's like, no, he fucking wrote it.
He just took the stuff he already did.
I think it's amazing.
A couple more things I was going to mention real quick for release dates, even though it's not next week, but...
There's a couple of the Konami Classic volumes that are coming out on Xbox 360 for $20 each.
And actually, there's a couple that are pretty good deals.
The first one is... Are these just like the live arcade games?
These are live arcade games.
Like what PopCap does.
That's pretty sweet.
They've got Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Frogger, and Super Contra.
That's for $20.
The other one that they have is Track and Field, Russian Attack, and Contra.
so Russian Attack by the way I bet is one of those arcade games you probably didn't play growing up at least I didn't but it was actually a lot of fun on Xbox Live Arcade for five bucks wasn't a bad deal anyhow so that's what they're available for now I'm not sure if they've dropped in price enough to where that's actually not a good deal anymore but three games for 20 bucks
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Samurai Spirits Zen Samurai Shodown
It's from SNK, so that is getting released on the 360 this week.
Some fighting game fans are going to be very happy about that.
I know that series has its fans.
Also on PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is out over there as well, as well as X-Edge or Cross-Edge.
Of course, next week is Final Fantasy XIII, and I know a lot of you over here in America are going to be importing that.
Tales of Graces Tales of Sinfonia Tales of Graces
Man, I remember playing Deshinden 3 on PlayStation.
There it is.
Now you get a version on the Nintendo Wii.
I don't know if it's a ported version of the game or what it is.
Oh, no, it's a redo.
Actually, I remember seeing the trailer for it.
Yeah?
Yeah, and it looked just as crappy as all the other ones, which means I have to play it.
PlayStation 2 you know the releases are dying down over there in Japan just like they are over here but I do want to point out World Soccer winning 11 2010 is coming out in Japan for you soccer fans Nintendo DS Luminous Arc 3 comes out on the DS this week and lastly on the PSP Bleach Soul Carnival 2 makes its way out in Japan as well as yet another Naruto game Naruto Shippuden Narutomit Excel 3
and WorldSoccerWinning11 on PSP.
There you have it for Japanese releases.
Well, we've got just a few notable ones for the UK.
On the 10th, Pixel Junk Shooter on PlayStation 3 and then on the 11th we have Tekken 6 on PSP and The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks on DS.
Very cool.
Alright, so back to some more gaming news then and then we're going to get into the Classic Game of the Week before too long here and of course our Part B in just a little while.
This is kind of cool.
You may remember we talked a little bit about this before.
Kind of the whole play, create, share games that they've got now on the PlayStation 3.
Well, the second one in the series is Mod Nation Racers.
And, of course, it's kind of like build your own Mario Kart type game.
But they are, just like they did with LittleBigPlanet, they're going to be having a beta.
And it actually starts this month.
And there's a few ways you could be in that beta.
One is, of course, if you bought... Blowing someone at Sony.
That's one way you can do it.
That might work.
One is if you bought the LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year Edition, which have a code that came inside the box.
And then, of course, you can also sign up online for a chance to participate as well.
and that of course can be done at us.playstation.com slash modnation slash online beta and you can go ahead and sign up there also you can be an existing subscriber to core or subscribe on or before December 15th to receive a voucher as well and you can check out the pretty awesome game which still no one has announced that it's going to be on PSP but it is going to be on PSP you heard it here first
Well, it also doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.
I mean, to be fair.
But it would be nice to have that confirmed by Sony at some point.
But you know, someday they'll decide to say it and it'll be a big surprise, except not really.
But I'm actually very much looking forward to Mod Nation's Racer.
I think this does look like another game that's going to be like a must-have on the PS3, so I'm very excited to see that.
So we'll see.
I was just reading in chat.
What's that?
Bon006 said, I think the gay marriage bill was just passed here in New York.
On a Sunday night?
Well, I... Well, checking the news.
There was one that failed a couple days ago in the New York Senate, I think it was.
Let us know if you find out.
Yeah, I'd be curious too.
You know, it'd be about time.
Live in the now, people.
Also, coming to the now, which I'm very excited about, Sunsoft!
Rise from your grave!
Okay, that wasn't a Sunsoft game, but still.
You might remember Sunsoft.
They made some cool 8-bit games back in the day, one of which, of course, near and dear to all of our hearts, Fester's Quest.
No, I'm kidding.
Blaster Master.
Although Fester's Quest wasn't that bad.
But Blaster Master was made by Sunsoft.
Yeah, it wasn't that bad.
For me to poop on...
Hey, I got that game for Christmas, one Christmas, and I played it for like a week straight.
It wasn't terrible, except it was very strange.
Like, aliens land in the Addams Family back... forget it.
Blaster Master!
Fuck everything else!
You have Blaster Master!
Who cares what else Sunsoft did?
They did Blaster Master.
And sure enough, that is the first thing they are planning to release now on the NES Virtual Console is Blaster Master.
Unfortunately, it's not like a WiiWare souped-up version or anything like that, but the Wii Virtual Console release of Blaster Master, 500 Wii Points, apparently coming out this month.
By the way, the whole reason this is happening is because Sunsoft is actually resuming operations in North America.
They're having a little help from a company called Gaijin Works.
And Gaijin Works made Miami Law for the Nintendo DS.
It was part of Working Designs.
Victor Ireland left them and kind of made this and so forth.
When Working Designs closed, da-da-da-da-da, one thing led to another.
So now we have Sunsoft.
Quote coming from Ireland...
Did you say Victor Ireland?
Yes, from Working Designs We have his Twilight Zone
Really?
Yes.
Well, he's the guy you can thank for bringing Sunsoft back to life.
Thank you.
And thank you for your pinball table.
Wait, do you have his contact information then?
Um, Dan might.
Dan actually bought his Twilight Zone and so he gave us you know that Goemon doll that I have?
He gave us a Goemon doll because they had a whole bunch of them because they were supposed to be for pre-ordering the Goemon game that they never brought out.
Let's see, here's some of the other big things that Sunsoft did.
Arrow the Acrobat.
They did the Blaster Master series, of course.
They did some of the Batman games, like the original Batman on the NES, which was not too bad.
Let's see, they did Fester's Quest, of course.
Some of the Final Fantasy Legend, I guess, games were translated by them, or localized, or whatever you want to say, by them.
Freedom Force, lol.
Lemmings on the NES they did a lot of NES ports of games that were big on other systems like Fantasy Zone on the NES was Sunsoft you remember how they had like a version of that that was done by Sunsoft so hmm very interesting Spy Hunter on the NES was them as well as Super Spy Hunter hmm I'd be very curious to see what they have planned
We'll see.
I would love for some type of sequel to Blaster Master because clearly that's their huge, huge franchise and something better than the one that was on Genesis because the one that was on Genesis, not so great.
Anyhow, speaking of stuff worthy of the virtual console, we're going to take a trip down memory lane in a segment we like to call the Classic Game of the Week.
and every week in the Classic Video Game of the Week segment, DarkSakura takes a trip to the video game vault and pulls out a game that she thinks, damn it, you ought to be playing this game.
You young whippersnappers need to dust off your NES or SNES or, as in the case of a lot of these games, Sega-related systems and play this game.
So, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
Final Fight.
Ah, a topically inspired game, I see.
Yep, I got inspired by last week.
Although, actually, it was also when I went and picked up my box of Final Fight Guy.
I was like, oh yeah, I should do this.
Because I found the box.
Hold on for a second, play some music.
Alright, sure.
This is the final boss fight in Final Fight Guy, which really would be the same as the regular Final Fight 2, but fighting Belger.
I'm sorry, I had to get the box because we're going to take a picture of it.
Wow.
You'll have to put that on the picture site.
I will.
Blockbuster exclusive, direct from Japan, Final Fantasy Guy.
Final Fight Guy.
I'm sorry, Final Fight Guy.
I wish I didn't say Fatal Fury Guy.
I've done that before, too.
This one I had my whole little obsession with getting everything Final Fight until they put out a Final Fight that sucked.
But I've got Final Fight CD and Mighty Final Fight, which was the SD version.
That came out on Nintendo.
But yeah, let me actually get back to the game.
Final Fight was an arcade game put out by Capcom.
And it was designed by Nishitani Akira, who you will see as Nin Nin.
And characters were designed by Yasuda Akira, which you'll see as Akiman.
So some of those names should definitely be familiar.
All this Capcom-tastic music.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
He's super fast and was super awesome to play with, so never mind.
Cody was the balanced guy, Hagar was the strong guy.
He's also ranked third in EGM's list of top ten video game politicians.
So there were... Hello, Random.
So this game is actually way ahead of its time, because it actually had pre-op transgendered women in it.
Whatever.
Anyway, yeah, there are actually two women in the game called Poison and Roxy, but they turned them into men named Billy and Sid for the American version.
So they were... So you're not hitting women.
I guess.
Or hoochie women with really short skirts and, you know, where you can see under boobs.
I see.
Under boobs.
Under boobs.
You know what I mean.
I know what you're talking about.
I haven't heard it phrased quite so eloquently before.
There was also the Andore family that were all based off of Andre the Giant.
Yeah.
Also, a character named 2P that was based off of Player 2 character from Forgotten Worlds.
Did you ever play that game, Rob?
I have like the special controller.
It was one of Capcom's kind of interesting weird games.
But since he looked like the second player, he was called 2P.
So anyway.
And then you had your bosses.
You had Damned, who in the U.S.
was Thrasher.
You had Sodom, who was called Katana in the U.S.
version.
But he came out and he was one of the ones that was brought back for Street Fighter Alpha series.
In fact, that's the other video version.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
He's like the uber crazy violent otaku guy who's so obsessed with Japanese culture that he wears a samurai hat and football padding.
It's stupid.
But yeah, um, but they said that the, um, the, uh, basis for, uh, Final Fight is actually off Double Dragon 2, The Revenge and the Arcade.
So, uh, they, uh, brought it up and they, um, actually were saying that, uh, some of the characters were former Street Fighters.
So, it's kind of neat.
Um, so yeah, there was the whole issue with the ports.
And I'm actually gonna, um, take a link off of the, uh, uh,
You can actually see pictures up, and I'm going to link them in the chat room, of the changes to the characters, to the Poison character.
But now for other versions, there's Sega CD, the Sega CD version, which...
I have, I love Final Fight CD.
It's got an arranged soundtrack in a time attack mode.
It's super fun.
I've got Final Fight 1 somewhere for GBA.
There was, when it came out in the US, actually there was an Amiga Atari ST, Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum, well that was in Europe, and Armstead CPC version.
There was a Sharp X68000 version that came out.
There was the one I mentioned, Mighty Final Fight, which was the 8-bit version for NES that had the super deformed.
And it's actually super fun.
It is really fun and really cute.
Cheap and Final Fight.
Yeah.
Final, well, no, super deformed because they are like the really squished up looking bodies.
Yeah, I've seen it.
Yeah.
also Final Fight came out on the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox and a portable version Capcom Classics Collection Remix for PSP and it had the emulated CPS music so that was pretty cool there was also Final Fight Streetwise which I pretend not to exist because it sucks um
or maybe it was the Final Fight Double Imp.
Nope.
It was the new one that they tried to do.
Yeah, whatever.
Damn, I only knew the Final Fight that was at the local pizza place.
Well, there's also sequels.
There was Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3.
I've got those.
They're actually fun.
Now, there's also...
An American Street Fighter animated series, and I know it sucks, but they actually had Cody and Guy teaming up with Ken and Ryu.
It was really weird.
They're also, of course, Mike Hagar's and Saturday Night Slam Masters, and Muscle Bomber Duo and Slam Masters 2, The Ring of Destruction.
Street Fighter games you had Guy in Sodom then Rolento and Cody in Street Fighter Alpha 3 and then you had in Street Fighter 3 Second Impact you had a character that was modeled after Andori and his manager is Poison I don't know if you ever played Street Fighter 3 just a couple times that was kind of during that phase where I was out of touch with gaming for a little bit but Cody and Guy are actually going to be in Super Street Fighter 4 yeah and I remember that was a story last week that kind of probably got you thinking about this I think that's pretty cool
Yeah, there was also another 3D fighting game version, Final Fight Revenge.
And then, you know, meh.
But also, it sort of seems that they used the same format, though, for a lot of the other games that came out afterwards, like King of Dragons and Knights of the Round, Captain Commando, Warriors of Fate, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The Punisher, D&D Tower of Doom, and then Alien vs. Predator, though, I think is one of the best games to come after that.
But yeah, a lot of that came through.
So yeah, Final Fight, win.
Alright.
There it is, your classic game of the week, Final Fight, available on lots and lots of systems.
I'll post those pictures.
The arcade was one of the most memorable.
All right, that's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere because we've got plenty more to come in Part B, including your Twitter topics, which I haven't put a call out for on Twitter yet, but we'll get those.
And I haven't seen any emails this week.
I don't even know if we'll have any of those, but we'll get to those.
But we do have some news, if nothing else, of talking about Redbox expanding to game rental, which I think has come up on the show before, but now it's going to the next step.
Somebody beat World of Warcraft.
Yes, somebody beat it.
More things to waste money on your Xbox Live avatars with.
And, of course, it wouldn't be lulzy if we didn't talk about an adult game.
So we'll be talking about that all in the next segment.
So stay tuned.
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 6th of 2009, where we're eagerly anticipating snow tomorrow here in Sacramento, where Orange Lounge Radio is based, when we never, and this is a big deal, I realize some of you live in the East Coast and even in other countries where snow is probably no big deal, in fact you probably hate it, but we never see snow here, so even the fact that it's just going to even like sprinkle a little white tomorrow is going to be amazing, I'm excited.
Too bad it's not Christmas tomorrow.
That would make it even better.
But, oh well.
So we're all excited about that.
Anyhow, we've got plenty more news to get into tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Of course, we always tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Time, right at the close of the Bobby Blackwolf Show, which is on one hour before we start at 5 or 8, depending on where you live.
We're going to get into some rapid-fire news, and then we'll get into your Twitter topics in just a little bit.
Thanks for watching!

When I ask for a BB gun, will he tell me you'll shoot your eye out?
Perhaps.
You know what's funny?
Is my character still dressed like Santa from last year.
Nice.
And that's how it's going to stay.
Now you need to change it.
You need to change it to like a Halloween outfit or something now that it's Christmas.
Nope.
You can be like Jack Skellington.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, I didn't think this game could be possibly ported anywhere else, but I was proven wrong.
Dragon's Lair is coming out for the iPhone.
That's right, the old school 1983 Laserdisc game, Dragon's Lair, that's been released on every single console.
Ever, it seems like anyway.
It is now coming to the iPhone, thanks to Electronic Arts, who is doing the port.
Not sure exactly how they're doing it.
It looks like you have little up, down, left, right arrows on the screen.
Right, except the corners of the screen.
Exactly, a big button on the other side for the sword button there.
It is coming out for five bucks, I think, because that's what Space Ace is priced at.
They don't have a final price yet, but Space Ace is five bucks.
They also had Cobra Command as well, which is...
Very similar.
I might need to get Dragon's Lair, except you know what I just found while I was cleaning off my desk?
Dragon's Lair?
Dragon's Lair HD.
Oh, the HD kind of different one they did a while ago.
Yeah, I remember that.
Hidden under a layer of stuff.
Wow.
I tell you, I sneeze and find games, Bob.
I still need to take a picture of Final Fight Guy, don't I?
Yes, you do.
Yeah, so, I don't know.
I will always be partial to the Dragon's Lair that was on the Commodore 64.
It was way different.
It was like a completely different game.
Harder than hell, but a lot of fun, I have to admit.
That's the one I'll always be partial to.
Anyhow, how about some news about Rock Band?
Of course, it wouldn't be a week here at OLR if we didn't have news about upcoming Rock Band releases.
More Green Day coming out for Rock Band.
Apparently, Christian's Inferno, Last of the American Girls, and Viva La Gloria, which I believe are all off the latest CD, 21st Century Breakdown, are on their way on December 15th or December 17th, depending on what system you're on.
Thank you for watching!
This is kind of awesome in a real dorky sort of way.
Simon and Garfunkel are getting some songs in Rock Band.
I am a rock and the sounds of silence because when you want to rock, I know the first thing you think of is Simon and Garfunkel.
DarkSakura, what do you got for us tonight?
Just a few things, actually.
And it isn't actually the page I was looking at about the land of make-believe.
Gearbox actually trademarked Border Worlds, so the rumor is that Borderlands could be extended into...
Thank you for watching!
And then the UK has a date for Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.
It will be the 28th of May.
And, of course, that's going to be on PSP.
And actually, in Japan, it's going to be coming out on March 18th.
So, four-player co-op.
It can be Snake.
Woohoo!
Snakeu!
And then Squeenix put out a song, a song, a game, a song summoner for iPhone.
It's actually called Song Summoner the Unsung Heroes for iPhone and iPod Touch.
And that it's got touchscreen controls, of course, and characters in different scenarios.
And it's supposed to be out, there's a demo for it out actually.
And for UK customers it'll be £5.99.
I've heard that Song Summoner is kind of anth though because it was out on the old school iPod you know well in other words the iPods a lot of people still have really they came out on those a while ago and I think it was kind of under the radar because the iPhones and iTouches already come out and a lot of those releases got missed but I'd like to see what they've actually managed to do with it yeah you never know they might have like kind of changed some things and done some upgrades too so it would be kind of cool to see what is going on
What I'd like to see what's going on with right now is the Twitter topics, so let's open up ye olde Twitter and see what you guys have to say.
Very fast tonight with the Twitter topics, by the way, I'm quite impressed.
Seg starting us off tonight, of course, with another plug for Umlaut, because that's happening this week.
Seg wants to know, are y'all going to Umlaut?
I'm going, for sure, but I think the fact that it's on a weeknight is kind of screwing with everyone else, because it is a couple hours away.
I'm able to kind of swing it where I'm getting off work a little early so I can make it, but I might be the sole representation there.
Sorry, but I'm going to have three times the fun.
So, meh.
Hope to see some of you listeners there that are local to San Francisco.
Alex Carson says I'm going to make a PSP app for your show if that's okay with you guys actually we do have a PSP website olrpsp.com and you can download a PSP radio tuner there I forgot about that in the earlier part of the show because Loki hasn't updated it in a couple years so whereas you might have some broken graphics and things I think it still works right Loki I don't know have you checked that out in a while
I think it still sort of works.
DarkSakura.com
Let's see.
DarkTetsuya says, Arcade Heroes is picking the best arcade game of the past decade, 2000 to 2009.
Thoughts?
My thought is, I'm kind of sad because this was the decade that arcades kind of died and got replaced with Ticket Redemption Machines.
So I don't know if I have an easy answer.
Anyone have an answer for what the best arcade game of the past 10 years would be?
Strider 2 I mean obviously DDR was somewhat impactful for us I would say also maybe like what was it oh gosh oh I know Final Furlong Horsey Riding Game Horsey Humping Derby Owners Club I would say Derby Owners Club just because it's so fucking epic like when you see it it's the size of an arcade amazing
Sky, I love you, let's repeal Prop 8 and get married
But I think you might need to take me to dinner first before I agree to get married, just saying.
Alex Carson wants to know, how many of you are phone freakers?
What is that?
It's like hacking your phone, right?
Yeah, I'm not.
Back in the day, people used to modify those Captain Crunch whistles to be able to dial the phones when back then it was the rotary pulse dials.
Is that this kind of stuff we're talking about?
Old school hacking stuff?
I find that stuff interesting, but I don't do it myself.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
um let's see let's see it was Javier Altman on Twitter says OLR pick your topic the platypus is made out of other animal spare parts or the saboteur boobies DLC with love footy well we already talked about the saboteur boobies DLC so uh the platypus is made out of other animal spare parts uh isn't that like a hot dog actually you're talking about I think that the platypus is god going see
Blue Swim says, what do you think of the Best Buy giving DSi buyers a free copy of Tony Hawk's Motion, a game which requires a GBA port to play?
This is where if I had the Price is Right Losing Horn queued up, I'd play it right now.
That's kind of humorous, actually, in a sick way.
That's hilarious.
That's a Best Buy movie.
I didn't hear about that at all, actually, so thank you for bringing that to my attention because it's pretty lulzy.
Master of the Claw sent us a YouTube link to some people having fun jamming.
Look at that, they're getting down.
Oh my god, they're dancing to Bird is the Word.
It reminds me of that Family Guy episode.
They're playing a game called Just Dance on the Wii.
Bird is the Word.
Did you hear?
Bird is the word.
The fact that that's in that game, that makes the game 100% good.
Actually, yeah, I heard of this game and it looked ridiculous, but now that I know that it's tongue-in-cheek ridiculous, I'm far more interested, so thank you for bringing it to my attention.
That guy is just getting down.
And that chick.
I don't think that chick would be getting down like this, though, if you weren't paying her to do it.
She looks a little bit...
LilBinimo.
That's awesome.
That game does kind of look like fun, actually.
Thank you.
Just Dance on the Wii.
I'm assuming that's out now?
I don't know.
Yes, that's out now.
I don't know, Loki.
Been out for a few weeks.
Loki, we might have to play that and YouTube it.
No, we don't.
No, we don't.
But Loki, didn't you hear?
Bird is the word
That could be the game of the year right there if we didn't have President Cat this year.
Speaking of President Cat, I gotta get this out here real quick.
Did you know...
There's still no word about President Cat getting a release over here in the US.
Just so you know.
There's still no word on that.
But, do you know what game is coming out on WiiWare in a couple months?
Muscle March.
Muscle March is coming out.
Do you know what Muscle March is?
If you don't know what Muscle March is, you need to YouTube this game immediately.
Because it's like... It's awesome, but it's like, imagine Cho Aniki meets...
That game meets that game show where you have to twist your body to not fall through the wall or whatever meets crack.
Pure adulterated crack.
I can't believe that game is coming out and yet no word on President Cat.
I'm just saying.
And all this bullshit about President Cat only sold 100 copies.
Source, please.
I mean, I know probably like a hundred people over here that imported it.
Apparently it got a shout-out on the 1UP show this week.
I don't listen to that show.
Yeah, they discovered the game, and so therefore they're informing the internet of the game.
Gee, I can't.
And they're the first ones that ever discovered the game.
Clearly, yes.
How about they're full of shit?
Everybody...
Send letters.
Well, to be fair, they didn't call it President Cat.
If they had called it President Cat, I would say something.
But we refer to it by name.
Yeah, I know.
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
How dare they steal our thunder?
I don't care.
I care.
I'm all about spreading the word about the game.
And if it gets it out there, then whatever.
That's why we don't get recognized, Rob.
We need to pimp ourselves.
You can't prove it.
I've got the internet.
I have the data post.
It was also on Joystick.
You've got Joystick and Destructoid backing us up, so nah.
I just don't care enough.
I'm sorry.
I don't care enough.
I don't want to become the president cat show, okay?
It had its moment.
I'm over it.
I listened to a little bit of the podcast.
They're like, yeah, we heard it sold like 80 copies.
Because there's 81!
They're firing on all cylinders over there.
Let's see.
Where was I?
Matt Ostrovsky tweeted us, by the way, one more tweet here that the OLR listeners will want to know.
OLR Evolution second mix will be coming out December 24th for everyone.
Oh, that's cool, like a little Christmas present, or Hanukkah present, if you will, whatever it is you're into, or Kwanzaa, I don't care.
Whatever you celebrate, Solstice, or, you know, what do Pastafarians celebrate on Christmas, I guess?
They celebrate Nokimasu.
I guess that's what it is.
A pirate day.
Anyhow, whatever it is you celebrate this winter, OLR Evolution's second mix is coming out.
If you don't know what that is, it's like a DDR clone type thing.
They take one of those DDR sims and they completely reskin it with OLR related songs.
I think they even take clips of our voice and now we're like the announcers in the game.
It's a lot of great fan work.
I definitely need to check this
I take it as a big compliment it's amazing so thank you very much fans for putting that together you guys rock
That Just Dance game looks interesting.
Doesn't Just Dance kind of look like fun?
It's only because that song's in there.
If there's any other song, I wouldn't give it to you.
I will admit, to the tweeter who asked why the hell we hadn't talked about it before, when I saw the box art and the songs they were advertising, I was like, this is going to be Weech here or something.
I did dismiss it very quickly, but it looks like it could be ridiculous fun.
If it was called Just Dance featuring the bird, surfing bird, you know, 100,000 more copies sold right there.
Gaming News and Loki.
Yes.
Um...
Redbox, the DVD kiosk rental place that's been popularized by all its locations and Walmarts and various supermarkets and everywhere else in between.
They are now test marketing.
Well, they have been test marketing game rentals in Reno, Nevada and Wilmington, North Carolina.
They're testing them out at $2 a piece.
Yeah, I've been well aware of this.
It's something we deal with, actually.
And hopefully it's something that will launch full scale at some point.
They're also testing some higher price points too for DVD rentals, but that's another story.
That's a whole thing because I hear the movie studios are pissed that they're only charging a dollar for DVD rentals.
Yeah, but that's... Because it devalues the movie.
As if ending up in the $5 bin at Walmart isn't devaluing your movie.
I mean, please get over yourself.
I could talk for a long time about how retarded that
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and that's unfortunately the case.
This actually, I believe, is unrelated to all that.
The reason why I think they're raising their rentals to $2 is because they're starting to carry more Blu-rays in there and you can't rent a Blu-ray for a buck a day and expect to make a return on your investment.
Yeah, that's true too, is that they're going to lose money at that rate.
But still, I think it's kind of cool though, $2 rentals for games.
I mean, that's not bad.
That's not bad at all.
I don't either, but I should.
I would save a lot of money if I were smart enough to rent the games.
My only issue is that the nearest Redbox machine I can think of is at Walmart, and I ain't setting foot in that place.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Which is funny, Safeway is next door to Walmart, yet Safeway doesn't have that problem.
Because Safeway hires security guards.
Safeway probably also doesn't want people loitering out front selling shit too, so.
I had people knock at my door today.
Two different people trying to sell me shit.
I hate that shit.
Someone trying to sell me the SAC-B so they can get their $1,000 scholarship.
Do you know how many of those kids have come to my door in the past couple weeks?
Because when I was home sick with the swine flu, I swear to God, three of those people came by the house.
I'm like, I'm going to cough on you, and then you're really going to have something to fundraise for.
Do you have any cans?
No, I don't have any cans.
Go away.
People dig through the recycle bin at my house.
I gotta watch what I throw in there.
It's kind of freaky.
People suck.
Anyhow, ToyGak in our chat says threaten to shoot them if they don't get off your property.
Sadly, it's not that easy.
DarkTattooia is pointing me to the peopleofwalmart.com website, which, by the way, love.
Love that site.
Hilarity.
Great time waster.
Yes, great time waster.
Hitstone wants to know, is Walmart that bad in California?
Depends where you are.
There's some really nice ones.
There's some really nice Walmarts I will go to.
I like to... Well...
Walmart for me also, when I first moved out here, I could not find a Walmart.
We had to go to like Alberta to find a Walmart.
Yeah, they're only new as of the past 10 years.
Well, now we have the super centers now.
Yeah, and honestly, that makes the difference to me.
If it's a super center, it's usually really nice.
If it's not...
for the longest time we couldn't have them out here because of actually zoning laws regarding grocery stores where you can have a certain number of grocery stores within a certain radius of each other but I think they since lifted that because I saw them building the one on Antelope way back here near where I live when I would come home from work and now it's here and I love it actually it's kind of funny I just stayed in there for two hours when they first opened it because I was so homesick when I get homesick I go to Walmart
Honestly, though, why would I ever go to Walmart when there's a Target just a couple blocks away that's brand spanking new and nice and even has groceries now?
It's Uber Target, and I love it.
Actually, Walmart does have better prices for certain things.
Okay, I know you're not a chick, but... Tampons?
No, actually, the hair dye that I buy, I actually get cheaper.
A lot of the stuff that I get, actually, I tend to get a whole lot cheaper than action figures.
Mm-hmm.
Where else can I go to get a bag of baby spinach and then run over and buy some Equate brand NyQuil stuff?
HitStun is mentioning Costco.
Actually, it was Marissa that first said it.
Screw Sam's Club, Costco for the win.
Costco's pretty awesome if you need like 15 of something.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
You know what?
It would be a smart arrangement.
You know what we do?
Well, we actually did just get a Costco membership, but we had a friend, actually our landlord, but he's a buddy of ours, has a Costco membership, and then Dan is our friend Julie's complimentary spouse.
Nice.
I actually got pissed off over that the first time, though.
Yeah, yeah.
But I think we have our own membership now, but still.
I like Costco quite a bit, actually.
Yeah.
All joking aside about the bulk items, they do have really good deals on TVs and the high-end stuff.
I got my TV at Costco.
I told you about what happened with ours, right?
Keep in mind, with Costco, you can return anything, anytime, without your receipt.
You can just go.
It'll be on your membership card.
We had our old 50-inch widescreen TV, and we actually took it back to exchange it for
You know, something that was equivalent.
And we actually now have a 52 inch LCD widescreen.
Because we could exchange it for anything equivalent.
And it was the only equivalent they had.
Our old model is not made anymore.
They do have a great return policy at Costco.
I did have a TV break and I took it back and they took it back.
Amazing.
Anyhow, I don't know how we got from Redbox to Costco, but we did.
So there you go.
World of Warcraft.
Moving on to this crack of a game.
World of Warcraft.
World of Warcrack.
I'm addicted.
What can I say?
It's fun.
But did you hear that it got beaten?
Yes, somebody beat the World of Warcraft.
And of course, they live in Taiwan.
And the character's name is Little Grey, if you translate the name.
They've beat the World of Warcraft.
What do I mean by beat?
No, I don't mean they beat the final raid in the game, because then a lot of people have beat it, if that's the case.
No, they have gotten every single achievement in World of Warcraft.
All 986.
Someone has no fucking life.
Here's my thought.
I bet multiple people are splitting this account.
I bet multiple people contributed to this.
It probably wasn't just one person.
It's still an impressive achievement, though, but at the same time, time to go outside!
There are some achievements in there that are crazy.
One of them is that you have to get exalted with Aldor and then you have to go all the way down to Hated and get exalted with Scryer.
That means nothing to people that don't play WoW.
It means nothing to me.
It's a lot of fucking grinding.
Let's just leave it like that.
It's like trying to gain one level in Final Fantasy XI.
It's a lot of fucking grinding.
That's a great analogy.
That's a fantastic analogy.
Yes, and it's accurate too.
Because, I mean, like, for me, I'm like, I can't stand to play with, like, more than two people at a time.
Because I'm like, you're going too fast!
So, just doing all of that would be, like, wince.
I will say though, despite all the crap I give Final Fantasy XI years out, I am super, super excited for Final Fantasy XIV.
I'm already seeing that 2010 will be the year I finally quit WoW because we'll have Final Fantasy XIV and we'll have Star Trek Online.
Star Trek Online is going to completely murder any free time I have.
I know, that's what I'm looking at too.
I'm going to command a fucking ship.
Did you see what they did to the Borg?
I've been very good about not looking at any previews for it because I want to poop my pants from shock and awe the first day I played it.
I'm still going to poop my pants, but I think that I farted a little bit.
To use your analogy, Rob.
Don't pin that analogy on me.
That's all you.
No, you're the one who said you were going to poop your pants.
I just want to use your same analogy.
All right, fine.
They did cool stuff.
So the Borg made you shard a little bit.
Anyway, some of the stuff that they were talking about is they were trying to make it to where you could not go back from assimilation.
They replaced your stomach.
Wow.
Because you don't really need to eat when you have a regeneration cycle.
I'm like, wow, these people are geeky on a level that is far beyond my comprehension.
So the Borg won't sh... Never mind.
They can't shit!
Unless they're going to throw up some energy at you or something.
They're going to fart sparks.
Resistance is futile, poot!
This was the moment when OLR got flushed down the toilet.
That's the moment where the episode literally and figuratively went down the...
Rest in Peace Orange Launch Radio 2002-2009 Alright Let's move on with some more gaming news Jamie, can you take us in a non-poopy direction please?
Sorry, I'm still laughing my ass off I'm laughing my ass off Are you laughing at what Salacious Pop is saying in chat?
I'm not looking They poop Sound Blaster cards from 1998 and laugh at you when they crash your Win 95 I lulled That's pretty damn funny
Oh, anyway, okay, so, how about some Tatsunoko vs. Capcom news?
Yes, please.
Cause Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is sexy.
Um, so yeah, actually, um...
There is something on one of the Mad Catz employees' flicker that is a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fighting stick so that you can actually play fighting games without having to contort your fingers to actually use the damn Wii controller, even the classic controller.
I was going to say, the classic controller's not terrible.
But it's not great.
It's like trying to play fighting games on the SNES.
SuperStreetFighter2
Well, anyway, the theory is that it could be possible that it's going to be a bundle, like a normal and then arcade bundle, like Street Fighter 4 had.
And it looks really nice.
I hope so.
I mean, because honestly, you know what's funny is that playing fighting games at home, I actually do prefer to play on a good controller over playing it on a joystick, just because of some of my hand problems.
But
I would seriously get this.
It's sexy.
Everybody else's face is covered, except for that crack Ho-Chun Lee.
Kogaki Ninja Tai Gatchaman
Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets Battle of the Planets
I'll give you that.
I mean, this definitely is catered to the anime convention going crowd, but there's a damn lot of anime convention going people, you know what I mean?
There's enough people that would take interest in a game like this.
Do you see this evil book?
Amano.
I have the giant book of Amano.
He did character designs for Gatchaman and a lot of the early Tatsunoko characters.
So, I'll find it and put a picture up.
Alright.
Sounds good.
Oh, here we go.
Open right to it.
What are you showing me?
Oh, some of the characters, I see.
Okay, very cool.
This makes for great radio, by the way.
Can I just point out?
Very cool.
Take a picture.
Meanwhile, Loki, let's move on with some more gaming news.
Yes, there's a new Xbox Live Arcade game coming out March 2010.
It's called Scourge Project, and it's a third-person shooter game.
It will be coming out on Steam, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network.
What's kind of notable about it is it actually looks really good.
It's being powered by the Unreal 3 engine.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and I don't know, it looks pretty awesome.
Really high quality for even like an Xbox Live Arcade game.
You know, kind of almost something that I would expect from a console, just a standard disc release.
But something to definitely look forward to.
It was actually announced back in 2007, but I guess it took them this long to actually get it finished, but eh, whatever.
And like I said, it's scheduled to arrive March 2010.
So it's going to be pretty awesome.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and DarkSakura.com.
That's right.
If you've always wanted a pony, you can now have one for the low, low cost of 240 Microsoft points.
In the real world, that's $3.
$3 for a virtual pet.
That's your thing?
Have fun.
What can I do with this virtual pet?
Um...
or is it just going to be like a handbag?
Like, you know, I have the dog.
Well, you can see a little picture of the avatar with the dog and I guess they pet it.
Can I have multiple animals?
The dog probably barks, but not really because I don't think the avatar makes sound.
They should allow you to have multiple animals.
Like, I want to be a virtual catwoman in the game and have like 800 cats.
Did you just say you want to be a virtual catwoman?
Did I hear that correctly?
Cat lady, not catwoman as in, like, you know...
Thanks for watching!
Oh, I want to see.
I see.
You don't want to be like Michelle Pfeiffer or Holly Berry Catwoman.
No, no, no.
God.
You want to be the lady that lives in the shoe that has 500 cats.
Yes.
That you hear about.
Lives in the shoe?
You hear about.
She has so many cats she didn't know what to do.
I maybe combined a couple things there, but she's the lady you see on the news that, you know, she died in the house and all the cats like, you know, ate her.
Ate her.
And then, you know, suddenly the SPCA doesn't know what to do with all these cats, so they're trying to find homes for 500 cats.
500 human eating cats exactly I can find a home for them our prison system but they're adorable by the way, I just want to point out people are actually going to spend money on this
That's right.
People will spend $3 so that they can have a cutesy little pet.
Here's my problem.
I want to make a point.
This is very important.
This just proves my point.
And I've said this before on the show.
This will make money because America loves cats.
But the cat they have is a Siamese cat.
That's unacceptable.
There's other cats, too.
No, there's just a Siamese cat.
There's the long-haired cat.
Oh, well, I don't have a long-haired cat.
I want a cat that looks like my cat.
I have Shermie that sheds enough for 50 cats.
By the way, the Final Fight guy pictures are up at the Orange Zones Radio Gallery.
I want a guy cat that wears an orange jumpsuit and karate kicks intruders.
That's what I want.
That I might pay $3 for.
whatever, it's your money spend it on whatever makes you happy that's what I say
Thanks for watching!
funny how that works that sometimes we get like 100 twitters like we got tonight and then no emails and some nights we'll have like 50 emails and no twitters or something else alright so we'll roll over and don't email us now it's going to do no good you missed your chance so we'll roll them over to next week so there you go but there's always time for ranting and usually right after the mailbag we take a moment to rant about something and this week's no different we have the FUs of the week
We have a story tonight to inspire the FUs, just to get your ranting warmed up a little bit.
And that is that a Florida father apparently was arrested and thrown in the slammer for getting high, gaming all night long, and then falling asleep on his seven-month-old daughter.
which suffocated the poor thing to death.
His name, EmanuelLawrence30, and he finished a marathon game session at 6am, and he laid her on the bed next to him, rolled over, and dot dot dot, I don't need to describe what else happened.
This makes me angry for two reasons.
One, I think it's pretty obvious, he was an idiot.
Two...
I'm seeing this on game blogs, and with all due respect to the lovely people that work very hard on game blogs, this story has nothing to do with gaming, and it shouldn't... This guy's an idiot.
That's the problem.
I mean, the fact that he was gaming all night long, he could have just been easily watching movies or doing something else.
It has nothing to do with games.
So don't run it on the game blogs, because it just supports that notion that somehow it was connected to the games, when we all know it wasn't.
He was just a stupid, stupid head.
Stupid, stupid head.
And for that, he can go live with the 500 human-eating cats for all I care.
DarkSakura, your FU of the week, please.
FU to the wimpy California people.
It's just a little snow.
If you really don't... I'm excited.
I'm not really excited either.
I actually feel really indifferent about the whole thing.
I'm just like... Well, I suppose it's novel.
But at the same time, I'm like, dude, if you're afraid of people on the road, don't go out.
Dude.
If you have to go to work, drive safely.
I'm going to call in Snow to work tomorrow.
Well, they also sent us that warning.
And by the way, thank you for sending me the warning while I'm in the middle of doing really good stitches.
And also, fuck this hat.
My husband just arrived.
F you to people trying to sell me shit at my house.
I hate hearing the doorbell ring and going to the door and not recognizing the person.
I always assume that maybe it's a kid that threw a ball into our backyard or something like that.
Dumb me answers the door and it's always someone trying to sell shit or someone that wants cans for me to donate to them for shit.
I don't have your fucking- Are you sure you don't want a subscription to the SACB?
No, I don't want a subscription.
Because if you don't subscribe, I'm gonna die.
I'm not gonna be able to go on my trip.
I'm not gonna get my $1000 scholarship!
I'm gonna be stupid!
I don't give a fuck.
You're an idiot already if you think that you're going to get a $1,000 scholarship from the SACB for walking door-to-door to sell their fucking subscriptions.
You're an idiot.
Maybe you should have been smarter in the first place and you wouldn't have to walk door-to-door selling subscriptions to newspapers.
Instead, you'd be earning a scholarship from, I don't know, someone that celebrates academic excellence.
You're an idiot.
And I don't want your fucking SACB subscriptions.
I don't care how you give them to me.
Get the fuck out!
I'm in a pretty good mood today, so I don't really have a lot of FUs.
I guess FU to traffic.
Like, people driving to San Francisco don't know what they're doing and need to stop.
Get off my bridge.
FU to the S-curve on the bridge, too, for slowing everything down.
Well, you know a lot of people, a lot of trucks have been running off of it.
Did you hear about that?
Did you hear about that?
There should be grinders and explosions at the bottom of the hill.
And most importantly, human-eating cats.
Human-eating cats.
Living in the bay.
That's what they did at Alcatraz, actually.
That's how people didn't escape Alcatraz.
They had human-eating cats in the water.
Cat sharks.
That's right, cat sharks.
True story.
Look it up.
That's right, it's on Wikipedia.
Quick, put it on Wikipedia.
Couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to your stories on our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
But first, some Skype stories.
Skype stories?
What the hell?
The Skype line, then some last stories before we get to the Skype line.
I'm dyslexic today.
It's crazy.
I'm putting up the last of the Amano pictures right now.
So they should be up.
Run.
Go look.
Quick.
Well, if you're in Japan, there's definitely your share of adult games available out there.
And...
DarkSakura.com
Well, this game you can also get with a collector's edition that's bundled with a special manga, an audio CD, and a personal assistant.
No, that's not a person that takes down notation for you and brings you coffee.
It is a pocket pussy.
It is a rubber thing that you put your penis in.
A fleshlight, basically?
Without the fleshlight.
No, they're called ona cups.
As in, woman cup.
Wow.
Just go to J-List and look at all this stuff.
I really don't need to.
I have commercials for them.
It's hilarious.
My life will be fine without it, actually.
I think it's funny looking at the commercials.
And it will be released in Christmas.
Or during Christmas.
Oh, just in time for the holidays.
Just what I always wanted.
A pocket pussy to take with me.
I did love, though, you gotta share the artwork for the game with our chatters, because I love the unnaturally large breasts that the women had.
They were larger than Springer Large, okay?
Like Jerry Springer's show, when he has the women with the unnaturally large titties.
That's gonna cause some back pain.
That's a Z-cup.
Yeah, that's some back pain.
I can't believe she doesn't walk over with a hunch.
I mean, that is just amazing.
That is some serious...
Seriously large boobies there.
I kind of laugh at some of the stuff that I've seen.
They've got the booby pillows or the booby mouse pads and stuff like that.
That's just a little much.
Sorry, I'm laughing at a comment in chat.
Salacious Pop comments, I'd carry a pocket pussy with me, but only to give friends sudden nose kisses.
Oh my god, if someone did that to me, I think I'd slap them.
Although the mental image is really funny.
Can you imagine walking up to someone?
I kiss you!
Wow, their website is sure detailed.
What?
And I guess they have different ones depending on which woman that you want to... Oh well, whoopee!
Like different depths and widths and everything?
Are they all loose?
They're all different.
The women in this game, clearly.
They've got different patterns in there.
See, you've got the one chick there, the blue, and it looks like nubs and ribs and something else.
That looks like a diagram that you see in a geology book about what it would look like if you drilled to the center of the Earth.
That's what that looks like to me.
Oh, well, you're drilling to the center of the Earth, all right.
Shut up, you ass.
And then that one right there looks like a spine and a screw at the top there.
It does.
It looks like an MRI picture.
And that one's got kind of like some sort of DNA helix thing going on there.
Wait a minute.
Is this radio really happening right now?
We're describing pocket pussies on our radio program?
That's not going to help our chat room.
I've got to link this into the chat room.
Yes, you do.
The commercials.
The commercials are hilarious.
No, thank you.
You know, Rob, they do make vibrators.
Oh, it was funny.
The other day we were watching and this is the perfect use of our PS3.
Oh, and of course, the one that looks like they're underage, of course, is in there.
You gotta love that.
Yay.
No, there is like, they had an interactive device or whatever that you would buy for your PC that's for porno use or whatever, but it's interactive, you see, because it's
I just got a picture of Marissa and she said, were the boobies bigger than mine?
Not by much!
Not by much.
That's an impressive picture.
Marissa has the best rack ever.
That is an impressive picture.
I am completely secure in my homosexuality, okay?
I am 100% secure in my fagness.
But I want to bury my face in that.
I can't explain it.
That's because you have something that's built into male DNA, whether you're gay or not, that boobies are important.
Were you breastfed, Rob?
No.
That could be part of it.
Link, Link, Link, Link, Link, please, please, Link, Link, please
And Marissa says, gay man motorboat me all the time.
I tell you, if you post that link in chat, it's going to get really quiet in chat for about the next five minutes.
Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
And we're going to travel the world here a little bit and go to Brazil.
And it sounds like Brazil is following in the footsteps of some other places around the world.
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Yes, it's in there twice.
Trading and custody, storage of the video games that affect the customs and traditions of the people, their worship, creeds, religions, and symbols.
In other words, they're basically trying to eliminate video games in bad taste, which could be violent video games and lots of things among that route.
You know what?
They've tried to do that many places and it never works.
Of course, Brazil isn't this country, but it would be sad to hear about that.
Just learn from... You can't stop freedom of expression.
I mean, as much as this, like, fleshlight pocket pussy thing is ridiculous, I love the fact that it can be made.
You know what I mean?
The fact that it exists brings me lulz.
So...
Alright, anyhow, we're going to go to the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
If you want to give us a call, we're going to take some calls right now.
The Skype line is open for business, taking your calls.
In the meantime, some last minute stories while we wait for the little delay there.
Loki, I don't know if you have anything to say.
I have one.
Oh, yes, Dark Sakura.
Boobs are great.
The end.
And we're getting a call, so let's take the phone.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Spazinator.
Hi, Spazinator.
What's on your mind tonight?
Two things.
First, so far, this episode's got to be the best episode of all hours so far.
Well, thank you very much.
Is it because it's very porn-tastic tonight?
I'm sorry.
With my ear infections, it's kind of hard to hear you.
Could you repeat that, please?
That's all right.
Is it because we're porn-tastic tonight?
Oh yeah, I mean, well, not just that, you cover your what?
Boobs, vaginas, and bodily functions.
I mean, um, yeah, I, uh, there's probably stuff you're probably missing, but I, you can't think of it off the top of my head.
Uh, well, yeah, to, uh, get into the main point of my call, um,
Yeah, I kind of want to touch on something that you were mentioning towards the beginning of the show.
Yeah.
Well, mainly the whole rumor of the PSP Go add-on.
And it kind of relates to the whole, you know, whatchamacallit, project mentality and the motion controller for the PSP, you know, PS3 as well in a sense.
It's probably a good idea that the PSP add-on doesn't come out, simply because of one simple reason.
Traditionally speaking, add-ons for systems do really, really horrible in terms of sales and whatnot.
Classic examples are the Sega CD, the 32X.
and more recently the 360's HD DVD add-on and the PlayStation 2's hard drive.
That did lousy.
The simple reason for that is that add-ons kind of like splintered the market a little bit and game manufacturers can't rely on
and people buying these add-ons.
And therefore, they tend to shy away from catering to these add-ons.
There's a lot of add-ons that don't do very well because they're not very well supported.
They're made for one game and then that's it.
You can go back through gaming's history and there's just tons of stuff that just wasn't very well supported.
The Super Scope 6...
But some were also very good on the other side because they got a lot of support for them.
Like DDR Mats did very well because the games that came out with them, there was a ton of them and folks got use out of them.
And the guitar peripherals do very well too.
But don't forget too, the biggest difference here when you're talking about the PSP and what we were talking about at the beginning of the show is that you're having an add-on for something that should have been there in the first place.
It's ridiculous that you would get this add-on if you just go buy the PSP 3000 if you want a UMD.
It makes no sense at all.
Yeah, you definitely got a point there in both cases.
And also, like you mentioned, the DDR maps and Rock Band, Guitar Hero stuff does sell well, but you gotta bear in mind that that kind of stuff is kind of in a minority sense, and
The companies that put those stuff out are taking a really, really major risk with that stuff.
And in terms of Project Natal and Sony's motion controller, sure, I'm willing to bet that there will be some early adopters that will probably get it for the novelty of it, and probably would use that stuff for a while, up until the novelty wears off.
Well, you know what, peripherals, I think to some extent peripherals give sometimes developers, I think right now, a false sense of security because DDR's done so well, because Guitar Hero's done so well, but I think Tony Hawk at the right is going to bring them right back to reminding folks that peripherals don't always make the game, that's for sure, and especially the amount that folks spend on it.
Yeah, true.
Yeah, the only reason the Wii's remote and nunchuck did well
is because, in a sense, Nintendo got it right where they packed that stuff in.
Right, and that was the system.
Every single game has to support it.
Therefore, there's plenty of games out there that support it.
But it's very interesting, isn't it, that sometimes folks complain about the Wii is that they should make some games that don't support it.
You know, that don't overdo it with the motion controls.
The Wii's been very interesting.
Very interesting.
No, not that I can't go.
Have a good one.
Yeah, sure.
Mirror's Edge is going to be coming to the iPhone soon.
It's a little bit different than the normal Mirror's Edge.
It's actually kind of more of a side-scroll game, but it's still 3D.
It looks neat.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Ranma, one more time.
Hi, Ranma.
What's on your mind?
Lucky you, getting through two weeks in a row.
Not too much.
A couple of quick things, and I'll be on my merry little way.
First thing is, I don't know if you saw, but I made a retweet about President Cat coming to the U.S.
Did you see that?
No, wait, like for real?
Well, someone on Twitter, going by the name of SMAT454, whose real name is Matt Cokes, made a tweet to Renoise saying that President Cat's coming to the U.S.
Uh-huh.
And I retweeted it, but it just kind of fell right in the water, so I don't know if you guys had heard about it.
When was it?
Was it today?
No, actually, this was about three days ago.
No, I didn't see it.
I've been bad on keeping current on Twitter.
Would I see it on Renoise Twitter?
Yes, and I actually have the Twitter page up.
I can put it in the chat room.
And even though it makes for great radio, it's twitter.com slash smat454.
Well, wait, now they're saying President Cat the Revolution is coming to the U.S.
They're just talking about the fever, President Cat fever.
I don't think they mean a game.
If you look at a couple tweets before that, they're saying President Cat for the win.
We need President Cat.
I don't think they're talking about the actual game.
I wish.
He's probably a listener to this program.
Probably so, but when it came across to my feed, I'm automatically assuming, wait, someone picked up the rights to the game, it's coming over, you know?
I wish, but if these stories about the fact that it only sold 100 copies are true, maybe it won't happen, but, you know, again, I gotta be careful.
I don't want to make this the President and Cat show, but my point still stands.
This game would sell if it came out here, and it will sell much more than 100 copies.
I mean, hell, they made a sequel to We Cheer.
I know, right?
And Muscle, hello, Muscle March.
End of argument.
Yeah, you got a valid point on that one, yeah.
Exactly.
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, DJ Ranma?
Something interesting.
Saturday I called Best Buy.
I had an issue about my TV set.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You're good, provided you bought your console before, I believe, September of 2008.
I've actually, I want to say I've heard of this before, and it's because the red rings are covered under Microsoft's warranty, and Best Buy don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.
Well, it looks like I got lucky when mine red ringed.
It's the way you need to do it anyways.
True, but the funny thing is
I used to work for them, and under this coverage, if someone brought the console back, whatever console it was, Best Buy would still get the full credit on it anyway, back from the manufacturer, so...
That's the part that kind of threw me off.
Maybe it's an administrative thing.
I don't know.
Strange.
All right.
Well, Ranma, thank you so much for the call.
And thanks for the heads up on Best Buy.
If folks didn't already know, it's something to think about, especially this holiday season as you're buying people Xboxes.
And also the other thing to think of possibly as a reason why they wouldn't take it back too is they could just say, oh, yeah, Red Ringed.
And in reality, their console got banned.
Don't.
Yeah, because the thing is, they're supposed to pop open the consoles and test it out and make sure, Red Ring or whatever, because that's what I did when I worked at Geeksville or something and brought back defective PS2s and Xboxes.
When I showed my 360 in the box, they took it, grabbed me another one off the shelf, and I'm like, here you go.
And it was a slow day, too.
All right.
Well, we're going to let you go, Ranma, so we can get some more calls.
But thank you guys.
Thank you so much, as always, for calling in, okay?
And upon you.
Have a good week.
You too.
877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and that's the place to get in on the Skype line if you have anything you want to talk about tonight on the program.
Other last minute stories we have, Loki?
Yeah, sure.
There's a PlayStation Network game that's going to be nearly 10 gigabytes in size and it's the PlayStation Network title Record of Argrist War and apparently it's a strategy RPG
And it's coming to North America by Axis Games localization.
One of the companies I said to send the president cat emails to because they localize all sorts of weird stuff, including this game that has apparently anime chicks seductively eating sausages.
Oh, joy and rapture.
This picture here.
Too much porn tonight.
Yeah.
I know there's no such thing as too much porn, but tonight might be pushing the limit.
I'm just saying.
I might have to put the explicit tag on tonight's show for once.
Anyhow, we got another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is X-Ling.
You never have too much porn.
What are you talking about?
Clearly, I'm smoking crack.
That means we're Orange Lounge Pornio.
X-Ling, I'm sorry to make you wait there for a little bit, but what's on your mind?
Hey, no, no problem.
Not at all.
This has been a great show from everything from snow to boobs to flashlights.
To snow boob flashlights.
I know.
And food.
It's been an amazing night.
Well, I found a little bit of information.
It was interesting.
I ran into you about this before, and I told you to look this up.
I don't know if you did or not, but they were talking about Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep.
Of course, it's going to be hitting over in Japan on January 9th.
But Jesse McCarthy, on his tweet back about November 30th, put up a tweet and says, Recording yet another Kingdom Hearts game.
All you gamers, eat your heart out.
Man, what a process, though.
The first recording was in 2005 for Game 1.
Which I think they said that actually the first game came out in the US in 2002, which then they said Part 2 came out in 2005.
But nonetheless though, which they're talking about, hopefully that means that we will be getting Birth by Sleep here come sometime maybe either middle of next year or possibly the year after.
So I'm definitely looking forward to that.
I'm kind of not surprised that it's making its way over here.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Let's hope.
You know I'm all about the Kingdom Hearts Part 3, but it also makes sense, you know, and I think this point got brought up a couple episodes ago, is that that team has been hard at work on Versus 13, which we've had very little information about, so you know that that game is still heavy under development.
I think once Versus 13 finally looks like it's nearing gold status and it's on its way out, which, honestly, at this point, I don't think is going to happen until 2011, I think we'll have more.
Because, you know, I think...
Here's my thought, actually.
Versus XIII, I think is going to be a big thing at E3 2010 for Square.
Because at that point, Final Fantasy XIII, non-Versus, the regular one, will be out.
Now that we know the release date for XIII, it'll be out in Japan, it'll be out here in the US.
That's done now.
So I think Versus XIII will be big.
And maybe they'll make a Kingdom Hearts announcement?
but I think that's what's going to be their big thing at E3 this year.
I'm sorry.
My prediction would be that the Kingdom Hearts and also they've been showing teasers especially over in Japan for it but the Parasite Eve the third birthday was also been teased over in Japan which of course did very well.
The first two did very well over here I believe in the US.
Yeah, surprising they never did a third one.
I still wish they'd translate the book.
I remember Parasite Eve.
I remember a story that we covered on the show.
It was a while ago, probably about a year and a half ago, but I remember this has come up on the show before.
It's being done.
I seem to recall it was on the PSP, too.
But it's a little weird that that's the direction they're going with it when they could do something, you know, epic on the PS3, but, you know, whatever, or 360, whatever they want to do.
I imagine that's something they're going to pull out of their hat at E3.
I'd be with you there.
I'm just surprised to see what they will do.
I mean, they're just going to try to, you know, go for it, you know, so if they do, that's great.
If not, then...
Alright, well, excellent.
Thank you so much for the call, and we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much as always, and have a good night, okay?
Of course, thanks.
Later.
Later.
That's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
Thank you so much to our callers tonight.
We really appreciate it.
Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.
But it's weird.
Tonight's show's been moving very fast.
We're actually probably going to end a little bit earlier than usual.
But you know what?
It's also that time of year where the games are out now.
So there's not a whole lot of, you know, people are going to be sleeping through December.
And we'll get more game news come January, especially with all of these postponements.
I think first and second quarter 2010 are going to be very interesting.
First quarter's pretty interesting.
All these games that got delayed are finally going to come out.
It's going to be very interesting.
But anyhow, we saw some last-minute stories, right, Loki?
Yeah.
And then other than Mirror's Edge, there's also some other decent games coming to the iPhone, including the iPhone version of Ace Combat 11.
or XI, I guess.
That's coming from Namco, of course.
It looks pretty awesome.
And they're also updating, I guess, Garters and Ghouls in relation to Ghosts and Goblins.
I was going to say, that's what it sounds like.
Is that like Ghosts and Goblins?
It's a zombie killing game.
And it allows you, they're going to have GPS support in it now, so you can move your iPhone around to turn your player in the game.
Actdeft wants to point out that's Ace Combat She, not Eleven.
She.
Because Ace Combat 6 was the last one, so you wouldn't jump right to Eleven.
Yeah, but you never... Okay, so She.
And let's see, what else?
So Sirius Sam, the second encounter, is also getting the HD treatment as well.
And if I remember correctly, the first one still hasn't come out yet, but, you know...
XBOX Live Arcade
Lips Party Classics will be coming out on the Xbox 360 in 2010, apparently in the spring.
It will feature 40 new tracks, including The Love Shack by the B-52s, Tub Thumping by Chubba Wumba, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, Rock and Roll All Night by KISS, Wannabe by Spice Girls, I Think We're Alone Now by Tiffany, and YMCA by The Village People.
and of course, you know, your typical karaoke game.
And then finally, to kind of elaborate a little bit more on what the Record of Argus War was, that's a game that had that soul breed function in there.
Basically, you find these women and you breed with them to create a new hero.
Okay.
Okay.
DarkSakura
Your final thought tonight?
My hands hurt.
Sorry to hear that.
Loki.
My hands don't hurt.
My final thought is I want a taco.
That's my final thought.
I think that was my final thought last week, but I again want a taco, just so you know.
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Believe it or not, we're coming to a close.
I know it's a little early tonight, but like I said, it's a little bit of a slower news week.
Not as much to discuss as usual.
Live listeners, though, stay tuned because we have a little extra something after the show as usual.
for those of you guys listening on the podcast though that's going to do it thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting our program we really appreciate it again all we ask you know we do this stuff for free so please tell two people about the show I know especially ever since the launch of the Facebook page a lot of you guys have really been selling the show to your friends we really appreciate that and the word of mouth goes a very long way and you know just want to let you guys know it's really appreciated because we don't really have advertising dollars we don't have a big magazine supporting us you know we're not on TV or anything fancy like that so word of mouth is all we got
So we really appreciate it.
And if you didn't like our program, that's okay.
We don't hate you that much.
But do check out some of the other programs on allgames.com, some other great independent podcasts that talk about other things.
You know, if you don't like us because we don't talk enough modern warfare, there's a show on there that talks much more about first-person shooters or whatever might be up your alley.
So thank you guys, of course, as always.
And we'll do it all again next week.
Except remember, guys, next week, sadly, not live, but it will be pre-taped.
If we can pre-tape it live, stay tuned to the Twitter and the Facebook for all that information.
Meanwhile, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
Until next week.
I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out.
or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
