19000	22000	Could your portable games soon be banned on airplanes?

25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	43000	We are live with our 350th episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December 27th, 2009.
43000	45000	Yes, we're here for the holidays.
45000	49000	Broadcasting live every Sunday night, www.allgames.com
49000	54000	We're an All Games Radio affiliate and we're very thankful that they let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night
54000	56000	to do our little program.
56000	62000	Joining you over the next few hours, myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only, Jamie Summers, DarkSakura.
62000	64000	Stupid thread isn't working.
64000	67000	How are you doing? Are you posting on the internet? Is that the type of thread you're talking about?
67000	69000	No, I'm crocheting.
69000	70000	I see.
70000	73000	I'm being domestic, dammit. Who wants a hat?
73000	74000	Wow, that's a change.
74000	75000	Who wants a hat?
75000	76000	Me? No.
76000	78000	You'll get a very tiny hat.
78000	81000	Say hello to... I'll put it on my thumb.
81000	83000	Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
83000	84000	Hello.
84000	85000	How you doing?
85000	86000	I'm alright.
86000	87000	Except we can't hear you at all. Is your mic on?
87000	88000	Yes, it is.
88000	90000	I don't know why we're not hearing you at all tonight.
90000	94000	That's the wonders of live radio, is that sometimes you get technical difficulties, things happen.
94000	96000	Sometimes people play with my volume, apparently.
96000	98000	Apparently. I don't know what's up with that.
98000	103000	I think what's going on is that behind our backs, DarkSakura's been secretly taping another show.
103000	105000	No! Not at all.
105000	107000	And he's been screwing with some of the audio settings.
107000	110000	I didn't touch Loki's. I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.
110000	112000	Try again, Loki. I think we'll hear you now.
112000	113000	Alright.
113000	114000	Now we hear you too much.
114000	115000	It's really loud.
115000	116000	We're good now.
116000	118000	How are you doing, Loki? How was your week?
118000	119000	I'm alright.
119000	120000	Did you have a good holiday?
120000	121000	Yeah, sure.
121000	124000	Did Santa bring you lots of good stuff for the holidays?
124000	128000	Pots and stuff to do yard work.
128000	130000	Dude, Santa brought you pot?
130000	132000	No, like pots and pans.
132000	133000	Oh, I see.
133000	136000	Just in time for New Year's, Rob.
136000	138000	Amazing.
138000	143000	Alright, let's go around and talk about our gaming week. So we always start off the show talking about what we've been playing this week.
143000	145000	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
145000	147000	Wow.
147000	148000	I played some.
148000	154000	And I downloaded Braid because it was really cheap for Insert Holiday Here.
154000	160000	And I also picked up World of Goo, which I started and then stopped.
160000	163000	Because I was like, oh wait, I have to do some stuff.
163000	166000	So I've got some new games that I just haven't played yet.
166000	171000	I also pre-ordered... I hate the word pre-order.
171000	176000	So I just ordered my copy in advance of Star Trek Online.
176000	185000	And apparently if you do the order through Amazon, or through I guess any of the others, you'll get like a thing to do the beta.
185000	186000	Nice.
186000	188000	So I'm going to be in the beta.
188000	190000	When's the beta start? I can't remember. There's so many like...
190000	192000	January something... something teeth.
192000	197000	It's like closed beta and open beta and retweet to get into the OMG Right Now betas.
197000	201000	Like there's so many betas going on. I feel like I'm in the 80s all over again.
201000	203000	And VHS is just around the corner.
203000	205000	It's January something teeth.
205000	207000	I see. Alright, thank you. That's so helpful.
207000	212000	But I also got Dan picked up for me.
212000	216000	Oh, by the way, it has to be the collector's edition.
216000	218000	Oh, for you to get in the beta?
218000	219000	To get in the beta.
219000	220000	I see, okay.
220000	221000	Which is what I got.
221000	223000	Which is what I imagine a lot of people are getting anyway.
223000	230000	And Dan picked up for me the Silent Hill game on Wii, so I need people to come over and hold my hand while I play it.
230000	234000	You know, I watched a friend play that game a couple days ago, and it was very strange.
234000	238000	Like I saw the nightmare sequence happen, you know, and it's weird.
238000	241000	It doesn't get all like rusty. It's just like snowy in that game.
241000	247000	And it was just running through doors over and over, running through doors, running through doors, running through doors, trying to avoid zombies.
247000	255000	I was like, you don't really run. I mean, you do run in Silent Hill, but this felt like an action game or something.
255000	258000	It was strange when I watched. I didn't play it, I watched.
258000	261000	It shatters your memories of Silent Hill. How about that?
261000	262000	Clearly.
262000	263000	Clearly.
263000	264000	You have a bug about to crawl into your hair behind you.
264000	265000	Just saying.
265000	268000	Gross! Gross! Our studio's infested!
268000	271000	It is not infested. Here's a tissue, you big baby.
271000	279000	There's bugs in our studio! Is that what you plan to end the decade with? Killer bugs, destroy the host?
279000	282000	Rob, it probably snuck into the window. Don't kill it, you big baby.
282000	286000	Hold on, I'm going to take a picture of it to show the listeners how big this scary bug is.
286000	287000	Oh, fuck.
287000	289000	Make sure to zoom in.
289000	292000	Anything else for your gaming week, DarkSakura?
292000	296000	I played the game where I laugh about Rob being a big baby.
296000	297000	Shut up, this is a big scary bug.
297000	302000	We also played some Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, which was really good.
302000	307000	When I upload this to the feed, it's going to look like a big poop on your curtain.
307000	310000	Just kill it already, Rob. Is it a pincher?
310000	314000	I'm going to kill it. I don't know. If it pinches, I'm going to scream.
314000	317000	Here, give me the napkin. Hold my mic.
317000	320000	DarkSakura saves the day.
320000	323000	I should just let it do its thing.
323000	324000	Not even.
324000	325000	Don't.
325000	327000	It's a scary bug.
327000	329000	It's a pincher, it's fine.
329000	332000	But pinchers pinch. That's why they're called pinchers.
332000	335000	They're not called pinchers. They're called earwigs, I thought.
335000	339000	Now that our show has been sufficiently derailed for the decade, Loki, how was your gaming week?
339000	345000	It was alright. I didn't play a whole lot. I played more Grand Theft Auto this week, what level I could.
345000	346000	It went crunch.
346000	352000	And then I brought my 360 home hoping to play more stuff, but I just didn't because I ended up messing around with other things.
352000	358000	So I played a little big planet of the new Pirates of the Caribbean water stuff.
358000	365000	It's neat. Not as exciting as the paint-neater, but how can you top guns? You just can't.
365000	371000	So it's pretty cool, but I'm just not as excited.
371000	375000	And somewhere along the way, I downloaded some level creator pack or something like that.
375000	380000	They had a bunch of other stuff in there. I honestly don't remember doing that, but I guess I did at some point.
380000	382000	So that's kind of neat.
382000	388000	But I was going to play also Modination Racers, and granted I did all this like an hour before the show.
388000	393000	So I meant to play Modination Racers as well, because I'm in the beta for that.
393000	399000	However, since I haven't played a little big planet in forever, I had to download the updates, which took 15 minutes.
399000	401000	Oh geez, yeah, I can imagine.
401000	407000	You know what? Hey, props to them, because that means they have just been putting update after update after update on that game.
407000	409000	Tons of updates.
409000	416000	I think the last time I downloaded the update was update 1.05, and they're up to 1.23 now.
416000	418000	It's a bummer, though. It's not smart enough to just go,
418000	426000	Okay, I'm going to download the patch that takes you from 1.05 all the way up to, without having to download like five patches in between.
426000	427000	Something like that, yeah.
427000	430000	Sometimes PC games do that, especially like MMOs.
430000	433000	So then, like I said, I played the levels a little bit.
433000	439000	It's kind of neat. The water stuffs are, I mean, you can raise and lower the water. You have air that you can breathe in there.
439000	446000	You can suck up the bubbles much like you would in one of the other games out there that has the water stuff.
446000	447000	Sonic.
447000	449000	Sonic, yes. Perfect example.
449000	452000	And the Pirates of the Caribbean stuff is kind of neat.
452000	457000	The characters, obviously, they don't really have anything that looks too much like the stuff in the movie,
457000	465000	but the same typical plot. They have the two royal guards or whatever, the imperial guards or whoever they are,
465000	468000	from the movie are in there and that kind of thing.
468000	473000	I only got to play the first level, though, before I wanted to move on to other things.
473000	477000	Then I actually played a little bit on the arcade cabinet.
477000	487000	I had a friend over and we were testing out my newly souped up joysticks because I added octagonal restrictors in them now,
487000	491000	and also tighter springs.
491000	497000	So I did everything except take apart the actual pushbuttons to put a little paper in there and stuff.
497000	502000	Honestly, I just don't want to mess with that because I have a feeling it's going to fall apart after a while.
502000	503000	It's enough.
503000	508000	So I played Marvel vs. Capcom 1 and I'm not very good at it.
508000	513000	I like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but I couldn't figure out why I didn't have it yet,
513000	516000	and it's because I don't have any Niomi games yet.
516000	521000	So that's why I basically spent most of the holiday doing was downloading Niomi games
521000	531000	and downloading Sega Model A games and zinc emulation games and all sorts of crap.
531000	539000	Oh, and CPS3 stuff, so I have Street Fighter 3 and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and all that fun stuff.
539000	547000	So anyways, the actual game I did play, we played all the way through Simpsons the arcade game on MAME, so that was fun.
547000	549000	I love playing through there.
549000	554000	Nice. You know there's a Simpsons arcade on iPhone now, but it's not even the same thing.
554000	560000	It's just the same name, and I think it's definitely inspired by the old arcade game, but it's not the old arcade game.
560000	564000	And I think that's because this new one is EA, whereas the old one was Konami, right?
564000	566000	Because it was the same engine as Turtles.
566000	573000	So obviously they probably couldn't borrow the same code, but they did a game that feels very like it.
573000	576000	But instead of trying to save Maggie, I think it's Homer going after Donuts.
576000	578000	I don't know, I haven't played it. I've only read about it.
578000	583000	But I find it interesting that they are trying to cash in on that nostalgia a little bit in the very crowded iPhone market.
583000	585000	It was fun. I love playing the game.
585000	591000	I mean, we had a lot of fun playing it, so that was cool, and I'm trying to think of other stuff.
591000	596000	We were just trying a bunch of random games on there, but I still...
596000	598000	Ms. World Nude 96, my favorite MAME game ever.
598000	603000	Didn't play that, but the problem is, see right now, I'm going through my list of games I have on there.
603000	607000	Because there's a ton of games, first off, clones that I have on there that I need to get rid of.
607000	613000	And I got rid of them on one list, but I need to get rid of them on the list that's for my front end so that they don't display on there.
613000	618000	And then also, I have a whole bunch of Mahjong games and crap I'm not going to play.
618000	623000	So I have to go through and delete all that stuff or stuff that just doesn't work.
623000	631000	You know, delete the Simpsons Arcade 4 player version, because I only have a 2 player cabinet, so that's just completely useless.
631000	636000	So all that stuff. So I have to go through there and do that, because right now I'm trying to find something that's just...
636000	643000	Luckily I can skip via letter, but even still, it's just you're holding it down, scrolling through lists of stuff just to try to find anything.
643000	646000	You sound like me trying to organize my iTunes library.
646000	652000	A friend of mine inspired me to organize my iTunes a little better, and I've been trying to do that.
652000	660000	And it is a mess. Like, I have all these misspelled artists and albums and trying to get the right album art and things from compilations.
660000	665000	It's a pain in the ass. It sounds very similar, just what you're describing is going through that whole process.
665000	670000	Yeah. So it'll be nice when it's done, especially I'm really excited to try some of these new Niomi games.
670000	677000	Because a lot of them don't necessarily work, and you have one emulator for Niomi disc based games and Dreamcast games,
677000	682000	and you have another emulator for Niomi cartridge games, and some of those work and some of them don't.
682000	693000	So some of the ones that will work though, like Ikaruga, Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, there's some I haven't even heard of before.
693000	696000	Like a lot of these really crazy shooter games.
696000	709000	Then just some of the normal ones like Senkei no Rondo in Radio Allergy or Ratagy or whatever.
709000	713000	A lot of the cave shooters and stuff like that.
713000	715000	So that'll be kind of cool to put in there.
715000	725000	Especially now that I have the heavy springs on, the joysticks for really twitchy movements and stuff that'll really come in handy for shooters and stuff.
725000	729000	So yeah, lots of downloading stuff for the cabinet.
729000	732000	That's mainly what I've been doing during the break.
732000	738000	I still haven't played Borderlands. I was like, I'm gonna play Borderlands this break! I'm gonna do it!
738000	740000	I haven't done it yet.
740000	746000	And I even brought home Bayonetta. I was like, oh, I'm gonna play Bayonetta.
746000	755000	What was it? Otomedius Gorgeous, the Konami shooter that has chicks flying around. I was gonna play that.
755000	757000	Just didn't get around to it.
757000	760000	There's just too many games. You have too many games to play.
760000	765000	People sometimes forget. We do this podcasting thing as a hobby. We don't get paid to do it.
765000	769000	We're just gamers that do it for fun, just like many of you who listen to this show.
769000	773000	The folks that review these professionally, that do have the time to play every single game that comes out,
773000	779000	usually teams of several people, that's their jobs. That's what they do for eight hours a day is play video games.
779000	785000	Wish I could do that. But then again, keep in mind, those reviewers, they have to play eight hours of the bad games as well as the good games.
785000	793000	Well, one of my friends actually did some testing for a while. I was so sick of playing soccer.
793000	798000	Testing or reviewing. I mean, sometimes, you know, that's a discussion for a whole other show.
798000	800000	I wasn't even trying to get into strategy guides.
800000	802000	I remember that, yeah.
802000	810000	And they'll have you review. They'll just play through some of the most games. I still want to do that, though.
810000	814000	You should. It'd be fun. Anyhow, sorry, Loki. Anything else you want to say about your gaming week?
814000	825000	That's basically it. It's just lots of downloading stuff, and I'm sure none of that's legal because, you know, they're ROMs and whatever.
825000	832000	But you know what? I'm not going to go buy multi-thousand dollars worth of arcade boards.
832000	835000	Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on the show.
835000	840000	And if you are listening live to us on All Games Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, head on over to our chat room.
840000	843000	Chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com is the easiest way to get there.
843000	849000	Or if you know your IRC, you just want to join the Game Surge Network on IRC gamesurge.net.
849000	854000	And we are in channel pound orange lounge is the name of our chat room.
854000	863000	Anyhow, reading some comments from chat, it went all the way back up here, talking about, I think Tiger Claw had said that it's appropriate.
863000	867000	Oh yes, what a way to start the last show of the new year or decade with a bug.
867000	874000	Going back to the bug. Because you know how sometimes, like, music will sometimes play when it's not supposed to here on the show.
874000	877000	Whoops, live radio! Shit.
877000	880000	It's the joys of live radio.
880000	887000	Also reading some comments from chat, Ray Iyanami in our chat room says, PS, get your asses to SVGL, Sunnyvale Golf Land.
887000	889000	There is a Simpsons machine here.
889000	893000	You know what's interesting? There is Simpsons machines kind of still out there all over.
893000	897000	I saw one randomly. I was at this hotel near Disneyland staying.
897000	899000	They had a game room in the hotel.
899000	904000	I haven't seen a game room in a hotel that wasn't a casino, like, since I was a teenager.
904000	906000	It's been a very long time.
906000	914000	One of the first times we went to Disneyland, there was a hotel that we stayed in that had a game room and I'd go down there.
914000	916000	I wonder if it was the same hotel.
916000	918000	Maybe, who knows. Was it near the convention center?
918000	920000	Well, the convention center wasn't built.
920000	922000	Oh yeah, that's right.
922000	929000	Anyhow, but the Simpsons arcade game, obviously a lot of people really remember this and it's still in arcades and probably still frickin' makes money.
929000	934000	But, you know, this machine at this particular hotel, their game room was in pretty sad shape.
934000	936000	Like, half the machines weren't working.
936000	942000	I think the Simpsons one was, but it was where the monitor was, like, so bright you could not...
942000	944000	Like, it's just faded over time.
944000	946000	But it hasn't faded dark. It's faded light.
946000	948000	I'm not sure what causes that. Maybe sun fading or something?
948000	950000	Even though it's in the dark room.
950000	955000	Well, probably what happened was it burned in and they just turned the brightness up.
955000	958000	Ah, I see. To try and avoid that. I get it.
958000	960000	My gaming week. Some of the things I played this week.
960000	962000	I did play a couple new games.
962000	965000	Obviously Steam is having an obscene sale right now.
965000	967000	As DarkSakura mentioned earlier, she picked up Braid.
967000	972000	I picked up Luminous because the basic and advanced pack were on sale a couple days ago for three bucks.
972000	977000	So I was like, eh, what the hell. I own Luminous on just about every other platform. I'll get it on PC as well.
977000	980000	So, you know, that was cool. It's the same game.
980000	986000	Certainly plays better than the iPhone one, although I still think the most underrated one is still the best one.
986000	988000	And that was Luminous 2 on the PSP.
988000	991000	I actually like the licensed music. Thank you very much.
991000	996000	And it's kind of a pity that it didn't catch on a little more or else maybe we could have had a Luminous 3, a real one,
996000	1002000	instead of just port after port after port of the same old game with some mediocre skins.
1002000	1005000	I mean, the skins that are in the game are okay. Nothing that special.
1005000	1010000	There's no shining. It's not even any Hollaback Girl, just so you know.
1010000	1012000	Other stuff I played this week.
1012000	1016000	Saw a demo for a game called Crayon Physics, which was also on Steam.
1016000	1019000	It was interesting. It was a very DS-inspired game
1019000	1024000	because you would basically have this little ball on your screen that, you know, you had to get the ball to the star.
1024000	1026000	And you did that by drawing ramps.
1026000	1033000	Or it was kind of interesting, like, you might have a little, like, a place where, like, a screw or a bolt is.
1033000	1036000	And so you draw a hammer or something around the screw.
1036000	1039000	And then it makes the hammer swing and, like, knock the ball.
1039000	1042000	Like it's croquet or something knocks the ball across the screen.
1042000	1047000	So kind of inventive, although it's kind of more the game I think I would imagine on the DS.
1047000	1051000	But certainly, you know, not everybody owns a DS, but a lot of people own a PC.
1051000	1054000	So this is a way for you to get into those kinds of games.
1054000	1056000	I felt the game was a little basic.
1056000	1059000	And the music was kind of crack.
1059000	1065000	Like, it was really, like, trippy, scary almost, how happy trippy it was.
1065000	1067000	It was a little bit frightening.
1067000	1069000	Best description ever. Happy trippy.
1069000	1070000	Happy trippy.
1070000	1074000	That's actually going to be 2DX 19th style or whatever they're up to now.
1074000	1076000	Happy trippy.
1076000	1081000	And DarkSakura holds up the thumb hat as she's talking there.
1081000	1085000	So happy trippy thumb hat, 2DX 19th style.
1085000	1087000	Let's see, what are the games I play this week?
1087000	1090000	Tekken 6 I checked out for a little bit.
1090000	1096000	I have to admit, my reaction to Tekken 6 after having spent a little time with it is,
1096000	1098000	lol what?
1098000	1103000	Like, that was honestly pretty much the reaction I had every few minutes we were playing Tekken 6.
1103000	1105000	Lol what?
1105000	1110000	Dude is wearing pink pants and shoots electricity out of his hands while he's standing in water.
1110000	1112000	Lol what?
1112000	1118000	There's a giant transformer guy who shoots laser beams into the floor that makes me fall through and I instantly lose.
1118000	1121000	Lol what?
1121000	1128000	The last boss looks like Zombie Big Bird 8, like, Ra from Stargate and is glowing blue.
1128000	1130000	Lol what is this game?
1130000	1132000	Did we have any Voldo?
1132000	1135000	Mr. Bondage Crotch?
1135000	1140000	There's 40 fucking characters in the game and, you know, Tekken has obviously been lol what for a little while.
1140000	1144000	It had the panda bears and the kangaroos.
1144000	1149000	Voldo was so caliber, but I know that they brought in, like, some of the really weirdo ones.
1149000	1151000	Well, of course, anything with Yoshimitsu in it is going to be...
1151000	1153000	The training dummy.
1153000	1155000	Did you play as Panda?
1155000	1159000	I didn't play as Panda. I played with my favorite tranny bitch, Anna Williams.
1159000	1163000	I'm telling you, in Tekken 6, she is one fierce transsexual.
1163000	1165000	Obviously, I mean, no disrespect.
1165000	1172000	She just looks like your stereotypical, like, wearing all the leopard stuff and the boots and all that.
1172000	1176000	Like, literally, one of her moves, you know how everybody has a throw?
1176000	1181000	One of her moves, she grabs the guy, slaps him three times in the face, and then throws him.
1181000	1182000	And then the other one...
1182000	1184000	She's always had that move.
1184000	1187000	She flips the guy over and, I swear to God, kicks him in the taint.
1187000	1189000	Like, get out of here!
1189000	1191000	Yeah, that's her.
1191000	1193000	Well, you know what?
1193000	1196000	I always thought that she was, like, an extra from Ab Fab.
1196000	1198000	You know?
1198000	1200000	Because we had to break out a cigarette and go,
1200000	1202000	I feel peckish.
1202000	1205000	And TigerClaws is saying about my Twitter earlier this week,
1205000	1208000	Oh, yeah, I read about your reaction. One of the characters is a tranny.
1208000	1212000	Not really. Just kind of has all those, like, stereotypes you would see.
1212000	1215000	I think, honestly, Anna Williams would actually best be described as,
1215000	1221000	if you ever saw the movie Angel from, like, 1981,
1221000	1225000	where she's a prostitute by night and an FBI agent by day,
1225000	1228000	that's the best way I could describe Anna Williams.
1228000	1231000	I know. Lul, what?
1231000	1234000	So that was pretty much my review of Tekken 6. Lul, what?
1234000	1238000	Although, I thought it was interesting that in certain parts of the game,
1238000	1242000	if you're playing offline mode, it kind of simulates an online mode.
1242000	1245000	You'll be playing against people with these fake gamer tags
1245000	1248000	that you're playing for promotions.
1248000	1252000	Like, I was watching my friend play, and he got into one of these battles,
1252000	1254000	and he was like, What the hell? I thought I was playing offline mode.
1254000	1256000	I don't want to fight people online.
1256000	1259000	You know, put the record at stake when you're not really, you know,
1259000	1262000	or just the fact that online players can sometimes be douchebags.
1262000	1264000	You don't really want to play with them.
1264000	1267000	But it simulates this whole thing in offline mode,
1267000	1269000	which is kind of strange but cool.
1269000	1272000	The game is actually a lot more deep than I'm giving it credit for.
1272000	1277000	Keep in mind I only looked at a couple modes on this particular outing with the game.
1277000	1280000	Didn't really get too in-depth with the game, but yeah.
1280000	1282000	Lul, what?
1282000	1283000	That's pretty much it.
1283000	1286000	Also, AlphaCananagram in chat says,
1286000	1288000	Skye, it's ghost data of players.
1288000	1290000	That's kind of strange to me.
1290000	1292000	Like, are they actual real people?
1292000	1295000	Because I saw, like, at signs and other signs
1295000	1300000	that I didn't think you could have in your gamertag as part of the people that we're fighting against.
1300000	1302000	That's weird that you can fight against ghosts.
1302000	1305000	I guess the chatters are sending me straight that those are ghosts.
1305000	1307000	They were around in Tekken 5, says Hitstun.
1307000	1310000	To be fair, I didn't play Tekken 5, so okay.
1310000	1312000	Maybe that's just a new feature I wasn't aware of.
1312000	1314000	Well, that's kind of freaky then.
1314000	1316000	What if I don't want my ghosts to be online?
1316000	1320000	Hitstun says, pretty cool, but they really only copied the user's combos.
1320000	1323000	Which really is what Tekken's all about.
1323000	1325000	There's not...
1325000	1331000	Tekken is not the fighting game with fireballs and all these insane moves.
1331000	1334000	Really, there's only low punch, high punch, low kick, high kick.
1334000	1337000	And those are pretty much all the buttons you use to do everything in Tekken.
1337000	1340000	And you just string all these combos and juggle, et cetera, et cetera.
1342000	1344000	AlphaCananagram also adds in,
1344000	1346000	Tekken 6 has been in arcades for years,
1346000	1348000	so they get data from arcade machines.
1348000	1350000	Okay. Interesting.
1350000	1352000	I guess having that kind of come to light,
1352000	1354000	obviously the game doesn't explain that to you.
1354000	1356000	I find that feature to be very interesting,
1356000	1359000	but it doesn't really change my little what reaction to the game.
1359000	1361000	Anyhow.
1363000	1365000	Let's see, other games I played this week.
1365000	1367000	A lot of World of Warcraft still.
1367000	1369000	I already have a level 80 character.
1369000	1371000	I've had one for a couple years.
1371000	1373000	But now my new character I'm trying to get to 80,
1373000	1375000	my Paladin, my Dwarf Paladin.
1375000	1378000	She is level 78, two bubbles away from 79.
1378000	1380000	Very, very close to level 80.
1380000	1383000	And I'm excited because I'll actually be able to use the new Dungeon Finder with that.
1383000	1385000	Hold on. I've got something for you guys.
1385000	1386000	Oh.
1386000	1387000	Fill time.
1387000	1389000	All right. Fill time.
1389000	1391000	Well, I was going to actually mention something about this.
1391000	1393000	Speaking of Warcraft and all this stuff,
1393000	1395000	I don't usually listen to other podcasts,
1395000	1398000	and I've kind of talked about why on the show before.
1398000	1401000	I mean, obviously I listen to Bobby Black Wolf because he's live before we are.
1401000	1403000	And I listen to most of his show because of that.
1403000	1407000	But I don't want to inadvertently take ideas from other shows or what have you
1407000	1409000	and all this other stuff.
1409000	1411000	Oh, my gosh. Thank you.
1411000	1413000	Dr. Sakura is handing out presents.
1413000	1414000	Yay.
1414000	1415000	Hold on. I'll open that in a minute.
1415000	1420000	But on Christmas Day, Scott Rubin, who is the ringleader of allgames.com,
1420000	1423000	if you weren't already aware, was doing like a marathon live show.
1423000	1425000	He was live for like five or six hours that day.
1425000	1428000	And I actually called him and talked to him for a little while.
1428000	1429000	It was pretty cool.
1429000	1431000	I'm pretty sure it will be archived on All Games Radio's site.
1431000	1433000	You can check that out.
1433000	1435000	We talked a long time about digital distribution.
1435000	1437000	I think he's very pro-digital distribution.
1437000	1440000	We had a little lively debate about that.
1440000	1444000	But I tuned in later on the iPhone app in my car
1444000	1447000	because I was driving to San Francisco Christmas night
1447000	1450000	and I wanted to listen to more talk radio I thought would be good for the drive.
1450000	1451000	But he wasn't on anymore.
1451000	1455000	Instead, this other program was on talking about nothing but World of Warcraft.
1455000	1458000	And it's called the Warcraft Outsiders,
1458000	1460000	which I think is a spinoff of Video Game Outsiders,
1460000	1462000	another All Games Radio program on the network.
1462000	1466000	I have to say, as much as I don't often listen to other podcasts,
1466000	1468000	I thought they did a pretty good job.
1468000	1472000	They knew their stuff talking about Warcraft and I thought it was interesting.
1472000	1475000	Since I play the game all the time,
1475000	1477000	I wasn't hearing a lot of news that I didn't already know,
1477000	1480000	but I kind of liked hearing about their experiences.
1480000	1482000	The gal they have on that show, I think her name is Michelle,
1482000	1484000	was kind of like the ringleader of that show,
1484000	1486000	at least the particular episode I was listening to.
1486000	1488000	She knows her shit on Warcraft.
1488000	1490000	I was very impressed.
1490000	1493000	She's a pretty hardcore raider and all that stuff.
1493000	1496000	It was a good show, so I wanted to give them a shout-out
1496000	1501000	because we don't often give the other All Games Radio shows enough shout-outs here,
1501000	1505000	but we are all about supporting other independent radio and independent podcasts.
1505000	1508000	Just because I say I personally don't listen to a lot of other podcasts
1508000	1509000	doesn't mean you shouldn't.
1509000	1513000	You should go out there and support all the other podcasts out there,
1513000	1516000	especially if you decide Orange Launch Radio is not your cup of tea.
1516000	1518000	I bet there is another show on the network.
1518000	1521000	It is their cup of tea, so check that out.
1521000	1523000	Now.
1523000	1524000	Now.
1524000	1525000	Now what? Open present?
1525000	1526000	Now.
1526000	1527000	Me first or Loki first?
1527000	1530000	You throw your card, so go ahead.
1530000	1532000	La la la card.
1532000	1535000	Crap.
1535000	1537000	It's a card, and on the tree it says,
1537000	1539000	wow, those are some really big balls,
1539000	1541000	and the guy says, thanks.
1541000	1546000	And it says, have a great big merry Christmas.
1546000	1548000	Get it? The tree had big balls on it.
1548000	1550000	I just fucked up my little hat.
1550000	1551000	Now I'm going to open up this box.
1551000	1553000	I don't want to ruin it.
1553000	1555000	It's his box, Rob. It cost a dollar.
1555000	1557000	This is terrible radio, though.
1557000	1563000	Hold on. I'm opening a box, folks.
1563000	1564000	No, it's not a dick in a box.
1564000	1566000	Oh, snap.
1566000	1568000	It is a...
1568000	1571000	Oh, cool. World of Warcraft year of here.
1571000	1574000	It's like a 365-day calendar.
1574000	1575000	I'm assuming like a desk calendar.
1575000	1576000	Yep.
1576000	1578000	That shows little locales in the World of Warcraft.
1578000	1580000	I will totally take this to work, and they'll really think I'm a freak.
1580000	1582000	It'll be awesome.
1582000	1583000	Oh, that's why I bought it.
1583000	1584000	Great. That's cool.
1584000	1585000	It's for people to think you're a freak.
1585000	1587000	Like on Tuesday, the 26th of January,
1587000	1590000	there's a little picture of the Violet Hold.
1590000	1593000	On Thursday, the 8th of July, there's a picture of Icecrown Citadel.
1593000	1596000	They just have all these little pictures from around Warcraft.
1596000	1597000	That's kind of neat.
1597000	1598000	Yeah, I saw it, and I thought you'd appreciate it.
1598000	1599000	There's a vast world in Warcraft.
1599000	1600000	That's one of the reasons to play.
1600000	1601000	Pretty awesome.
1601000	1602000	Okay, so, Loki.
1602000	1604000	Open your box, Loki.
1604000	1605000	Do it.
1605000	1607000	My card says, bacon, how'd you know?
1607000	1613000	And it's a dog jumping up and down because he got a box full of bacon.
1613000	1615000	Hope you get just what you're looking for this Christmas.
1615000	1616000	Is that what you got?
1616000	1617000	A box full of bacon?
1617000	1618000	Well, I don't know.
1618000	1619000	Open your box!
1619000	1620000	What's in the box?
1620000	1621000	What's in the box?
1621000	1622000	Do it!
1622000	1623000	La, la, box.
1623000	1624000	What's in the fucking box?
1624000	1625000	La, la, box.
1625000	1629000	Tell me what's in the box.
1629000	1632000	Loki's opening his box very slowly.
1632000	1636000	So, Rob, did you see the thing that I posted on Facebook earlier?
1636000	1641000	The 30 seconds of Lich King?
1641000	1642000	Uh-uh.
1642000	1646000	I got the worst case scenario daily survival calendar 2010.
1646000	1647000	Nice.
1647000	1651000	Day-to-day guide to surviving a year's worth of peril.
1651000	1655000	Isn't this what inspired your old advice column you used to do?
1655000	1656000	Yes.
1656000	1660000	I used to have this calendar a few years ago, and I remember just cracking up on a daily
1660000	1665000	basis, and I figured that Loki would appreciate some advice, like how to deliver a baby.
1665000	1666000	In a mall.
1666000	1667000	Very nice.
1667000	1670000	How to control a runaway camel.
1670000	1673000	How to navigate a minefield successfully.
1673000	1675000	And how to drive Santa's sleigh.
1675000	1680000	If you can find some old-ass episodes of our to-go show, which I think was around 2005,
1680000	1686000	2006, when we first were getting into podcasting, we would do like a three to four hour live
1686000	1690000	show, then record another hour that was separately podcast.
1690000	1694000	We merged the shows finally, got smart and merged them together finally a couple years
1694000	1698000	later, but if you can find some old episodes of the to-go show, it was really funny, because
1698000	1702000	Dark Sakura had these little advice columns that were like, lol what?
1702000	1708000	They have some pretty appropriate stuff, like for example, New Year's Day, it's an essential
1708000	1712000	survivor knowledge appropriate attire for winter weather.
1712000	1714000	Really this should be the date before.
1714000	1718000	How to carry someone who has passed out.
1718000	1719000	Very useful.
1719000	1725000	I freaking love worst case scenario, so I thought that maybe Loki would too.
1725000	1729000	How to deflect a deflect encounter or a sword blow.
1729000	1733000	Well it was either that or I was trying to decide who I was going to give the bitch a
1733000	1734000	day calendar to.
1734000	1740000	How does it actually have 365 bitches on it or is it like complaints?
1740000	1745000	It's like those magnet that you have the one that says remember when fat butts were in
1745000	1752000	there, or the I'm having screaming PMS with a really happy looking 40's chick on there.
1752000	1754000	That type of thing.
1754000	1756000	It was all stuff like that.
1756000	1759000	How to land a runaway hire balloon.
1759000	1760000	Just in case.
1760000	1761000	You never know, Loki.
1761000	1762000	You never know.
1762000	1763000	You might need it.
1763000	1764000	Rama in chat is bragging.
1764000	1766000	He has all of the OLR to-go podcasts.
1766000	1770000	I thought there was an archive online somewhere, and I know there's like, and Dark Tetsuya is
1770000	1773000	talking about the descriptions on the wiki, and I haven't talked about this a lot on the
1773000	1779000	show, but on Wikia.com, there's actually a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki that you can
1779000	1783000	look up, and it actually has like descriptions of the years and years worth of shows we've
1783000	1786000	done ever since the very first one on June 23rd of 2002.
1786000	1788000	The one that I had the screaming migraine during?
1788000	1789000	Yes.
1789000	1790000	The very first show.
1790000	1791000	Crazy.
1791000	1792000	So.
1792000	1793000	Anyhow.
1793000	1796000	Alright, well we've got to do our 350th show.
1796000	1798000	It's somewhat of a landmark number, yes?
1798000	1799000	Multiple of 50?
1799000	1801000	By the way.
1801000	1802000	Who's the baby on your screen right now on Facebook?
1802000	1804000	That's our friend Megumi's baby.
1804000	1805000	Luke.
1805000	1806000	Aww.
1806000	1807000	That's cute.
1807000	1808000	He's cute.
1808000	1809000	I know, it's great radio, but.
1809000	1813000	Although that reaction is somewhat like, did you ever see Bat Boy on the World News?
1813000	1814000	No.
1814000	1815000	Cover?
1815000	1816000	With a rah!
1816000	1817000	With a face?
1817000	1820000	That's just a cute little baby yawn.
1820000	1821000	Alright.
1821000	1825000	Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1825000	1826000	Of course, we're on Twitter.
1826000	1827000	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1827000	1829000	We also have a Facebook now.
1829000	1831000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1831000	1834000	You should definitely follow us on those sites.
1834000	1838000	We will still be here live next Sunday and the Sunday after.
1838000	1843000	I do not know yet what the plan is for the show on January the...
1843000	1845000	I'm looking at my calendar here.
1845000	1846000	January the 17th.
1846000	1847000	I'm going to be out of town.
1847000	1850000	I'm going to Seattle for the long weekend because that is Martin Luther King weekend.
1850000	1852000	We have that day off of work.
1852000	1855000	When Southwest had an Uber sale, I booked a trip to Seattle.
1855000	1858000	I'll be gone that Sunday, so we'll figure out what we're doing then.
1858000	1862000	I hear there's a best of in the works, so maybe that'll finally be ready by that week.
1862000	1863000	I'm not sure.
1863000	1864000	Just so you know.
1864000	1866000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
1866000	1868000	Believe it or not, we have some gaming news tonight.
1868000	1870000	Tonight in part A, we're going to do kind of our usual thing,
1870000	1871000	talking about the news that happened this week,
1871000	1875000	even though it was a little bit of a slow news week with the holidays in the States and all.
1875000	1879000	And then in part B, we're going to really talk about the year in review and the decade in review,
1879000	1883000	as I'm sure a lot of your favorite shows are doing this week because it was a slow news week.
1883000	1885000	That's kind of what people talk about during the holidays.
1885000	1887000	So, Loki, start us off tonight with some news.
1887000	1888000	Yes.
1888000	1893000	Capcom has decided to pull a few games from their Quarter 1 2010 lineup,
1893000	1900000	including Super Street Fighter IV, Lost Planet 2, and Monster Hunter Tri.
1900000	1907000	And from what I've seen, they haven't really announced yet when they're going to put these games out.
1907000	1915000	My guess would be not far after the first quarter, which ends, of course, April 1, 2010.
1915000	1923000	So, basically, these games are scheduled to come out any time between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011,
1923000	1927000	because they're delayed to their fiscal 2011 year.
1927000	1930000	And they said they're planning on spreading them across all four quarters,
1930000	1936000	which makes sense if you think about it because Capcom usually frontloads the first part of the year with their games,
1936000	1941000	and I'm sure that a lot of the stuff that they put out ends up competing with itself.
1941000	1944000	So, it kind of makes sense that you would want to spread that out.
1944000	1947000	And they still do have some stuff coming out in the first quarter.
1947000	1953000	They have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Ultimate All-Stars, and, of course, Dark Void coming out as well.
1953000	1960000	And that's not even including the other things that they're planning on releasing digital distribution-wise,
1960000	1963000	including Mega Man 10.
1963000	1966000	So, a lot of stuff coming out still.
1966000	1970000	It's still a little bit disappointing, though, because when I read the article, what you say makes a lot of sense.
1970000	1975000	They don't want to load the year too front-heavy, I guess, for lack of a better term.
1975000	1978000	But there were some big, you know, like Super Street Fighter IV,
1978000	1981000	I had the feeling we were going to be playing it come February or March.
1981000	1982000	I still think we may.
1982000	1986000	I still think it may come out in like April or May, not too far from where it was,
1986000	1990000	because originally it was kind of slated around March,
1990000	1994000	and I think now it's just going to be coming out slightly later, maybe in April or something.
1994000	1998000	Same with Monster Hunter Tri and Lost Planet 2.
1998000	2001000	Dead Rising 2 still at some point.
2001000	2004000	But, I mean, they have a pretty big slate of games coming out this year.
2004000	2008000	It's just, you know, not putting them all out at the same time.
2008000	2011000	Well, since tonight is, in some respects, a year in a review show,
2011000	2013000	I mean, God, this news is nothing new.
2013000	2016000	It's like all we've heard over the past four months,
2016000	2020000	or really ever since probably like July when we were talking about games coming out at the end of the year.
2020000	2023000	Delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.
2023000	2026000	Like, I really feel like, you know, we've been doing this show a long time.
2026000	2029000	I really feel like this year especially.
2029000	2031000	I mean, games always get delayed. I get that.
2031000	2035000	But this year especially, I really feel like lots of games got delayed.
2035000	2037000	Well, a lot of it's because of Modern Warfare 2,
2037000	2040000	and a lot of people were afraid to kind of take on Modern Warfare 2,
2040000	2043000	and so they've delayed their games to other parts of the year,
2043000	2045000	which is fine because I think that's good.
2045000	2048000	Normally we get these really dead months where there's nothing coming out,
2048000	2051000	and I'm like, you know, hey, it'd be the perfect time to put this game out
2051000	2053000	because there's really nothing competing with it right now.
2053000	2056000	Like April, I mean, most of April's going to be pretty dead.
2056000	2059000	I mean, you're going to have Red Dead Redemption on the 27th,
2059000	2062000	but as far as I'm aware, there's normally not much coming out in April.
2062000	2064000	It's pretty dead.
2064000	2066000	Isn't that kind of traditional, though, that not much comes out around that time?
2066000	2069000	Because that's when you're starting to get into finals and college,
2069000	2071000	which is your big gaming base and so forth.
2071000	2072000	They don't care about that kind of stuff, though.
2072000	2073000	They're really...
2073000	2074000	You don't think that kind of stuff cuts into sales?
2074000	2075000	No, I don't think it really matters.
2075000	2078000	I think it's just development cycles and really a lot of this stuff,
2078000	2081000	you know, they try to push it out before the end of March because...
2081000	2084000	Wait a minute. Isn't Final Fantasy 13 April, or is that March?
2084000	2085000	That's March.
2085000	2086000	Okay, my bad.
2086000	2089000	Yeah, so Final Fantasy 13's kind of the beginning of March,
2089000	2094000	but that may be another reason, too, why some of these delays are happening
2094000	2097000	because if they're coming out around the same time as Final Fantasy 13,
2097000	2098000	maybe that's another...
2098000	2102000	Yeah, it's not as big as Modern Warfare 2, but it's going to be pretty big.
2102000	2104000	And it's a completely different audience, you know what I mean?
2104000	2106000	Like the kind of people that play Final Fantasy 13
2106000	2108000	aren't going to play these other types of games.
2108000	2110000	Well, you know, there's always somebody that plays both.
2110000	2113000	Well, Monster Hunter, I think, kind of, you know, it's a little similar.
2113000	2115000	Okay, I can see that kind of having some similar crossover.
2115000	2119000	Street Fighter, yeah, not much of a crossover there, but still, though, it's, you know...
2119000	2122000	It's a very similar strategy to how they do movies, right?
2122000	2124000	You hear about movies getting delayed all the time
2124000	2127000	because they don't want to compete against another movie that's too similar,
2127000	2131000	but movies that are completely kind of different is okay.
2131000	2135000	Like, for instance, a lot of weekends you have a big bang-up action movie
2135000	2139000	opening up against a movie targeted at women
2139000	2142000	that's more like, you know, Meryl Streep's vagina, da-da-da.
2142000	2144000	You know, like all these, you know, kind of softer things
2144000	2146000	usually open up kind of together.
2146000	2149000	Like, look at Christmas. We had Sherlock Holmes, Avatar
2149000	2152000	are both kind of, you know, bang-up action-y type things.
2152000	2154000	And then you have the Meryl Streep movie.
2154000	2155000	Oh, yeah.
2155000	2157000	Alvin and the Chipmunks for kids, you know, different audiences.
2157000	2160000	And then look at also, like, you know, some of the releases and stuff on different platforms.
2160000	2162000	You know, the first part of the year so far,
2162000	2166000	there's not really any first-party Microsoft games coming out,
2166000	2167000	at least in the first quarter.
2167000	2170000	I've seen there's nothing coming out from them yet,
2170000	2172000	or it has been announced.
2172000	2174000	You know, I'm kind of surprised there.
2174000	2177000	I would have thought, you know, maybe Crackdown 2 might be coming out.
2177000	2183000	Or, hey, even, you know, maybe...
2183000	2186000	Oh, what was it?
2186000	2188000	I can't remember the name of the game now.
2188000	2190000	Oh, that's all right, because I'm not buying it.
2190000	2193000	The other Microsoft, Alan Wake, that's right.
2193000	2196000	The one that's been delayed forever, you know.
2196000	2198000	It probably won't be that great.
2198000	2200000	Oh, it looks all right.
2200000	2205000	But I guess it's good that they're delaying stuff just a little bit, you know,
2205000	2209000	and it kind of sucks because they have to kind of lower their projections
2209000	2213000	for how they're going to finish up their, you know, 2010 financial year.
2213000	2216000	But in the end, I think it's going to end up being more beneficial to them
2216000	2221000	because they're going to be able to capitalize on these dead parts of, you know, the year
2221000	2225000	and maybe not necessarily competing with these big blockbuster games.
2225000	2228000	But then again, you know, you have these companies that still put out everything in the fourth quarter,
2228000	2230000	like Activision, you know.
2230000	2234000	They put their big games right there in November, October.
2234000	2237000	And, you know, I don't think this year is going to be different.
2237000	2240000	Obviously, you're going to have another Call of Duty game
2240000	2248000	and some more Guitar Hero games and some more, you know, DJ Hero and who knows what.
2248000	2250000	Hmm.
2250000	2252000	It's definitely going to be a busy year next year,
2252000	2253000	but then I wonder how much we're going to hear next year.
2253000	2256000	Delayed again, delayed again, lololol.
2256000	2258000	There's going to be a lot of stuff that's delayed.
2258000	2261000	Natal delayed, Sony Motion delayed, hahaha.
2261000	2262000	That's the other thing too.
2262000	2266000	There's a lot of that stuff coming out, you know, kind of in the,
2266000	2268000	I want to say it was supposed to be the second quarter,
2268000	2272000	and maybe some of these games are going to use some of that.
2272000	2274000	Maybe they're delaying it because of that.
2274000	2276000	Or maybe they're going to delay them to add that kind of stuff.
2276000	2279000	Or maybe, I don't know.
2279000	2281000	Or maybe we're talking out our ass because we don't really know.
2281000	2283000	We don't know. We can only guess.
2283000	2286000	All right. Hey, speaking of talking out your ass about things you may not know about,
2286000	2288000	it's sure fun to speculate what this is all about.
2288000	2292000	Apparently, in Europe, Namco Bandai has made a new trademark.
2292000	2296000	It's called Pac-Man Battle Royale.
2296000	2297000	Don't know what the heck that could be.
2297000	2300000	Could that be a fighting game involving Pac-Man?
2300000	2305000	One of the interesting theories is that it's some type of multiplayer champion edition
2305000	2307000	because obviously Pac-Man Championship Edition, you know,
2307000	2310000	really kind of revitalized the series in a way.
2310000	2313000	Not a lot of previous Pac-Man games have done.
2313000	2315000	I mean, I don't know if you guys know,
2315000	2319000	but there's been lots of Pac-Man games since the original and Ms. Pac-Man
2319000	2321000	and even, like, Junior Pac-Man, some of those things.
2321000	2323000	Like Pac-Mania and all that.
2323000	2327000	But then, gosh, there was a lot of, like, weird Pac-Man platformer games.
2327000	2328000	Pac-Land.
2328000	2331000	Yeah, and all these weird things that were on PlayStation and so forth.
2331000	2334000	Pac-Man Championship Edition kind of took the game back to its roots and energized it,
2334000	2337000	kind of gave it a little bit of a, you know, I don't know,
2337000	2341000	music game infused boost in a way and more fast-paced action.
2341000	2345000	It's kind of thought that maybe a sequel to that could be where this is going.
2345000	2347000	But if I seem to remember right,
2347000	2351000	the guy who originally made Pac-Man was involved with Championship Edition,
2351000	2354000	which might be part of the reason why it was so successful.
2354000	2359000	If he's not involved here, I'm a little worried, but who knows?
2359000	2363000	But could this be just, like, something very similar to that Pac-Man game that they had
2363000	2366000	that was originally supposed to come out on the GameCube and never did
2366000	2367000	or something like that?
2367000	2368000	Like the versus?
2368000	2369000	Yeah, like the versus.
2369000	2371000	It was out, but it was really hard to get, if I remember right,
2371000	2374000	because Dark Soccer was talking about playing it, I remember, years ago.
2374000	2376000	She was talking about, you remember Pac-Man versus?
2376000	2377000	Yeah.
2377000	2379000	Yeah, that was out, but it was kind of hard to find, wasn't it?
2379000	2381000	We had a bunch of copies of it.
2381000	2383000	I don't remember how, maybe a chatter remembers this better.
2383000	2385000	There was something you had to do to get it.
2385000	2386000	We had a stack of them and we're giving them out.
2386000	2388000	Yeah, but you had to get a copy of it somehow.
2388000	2391000	It was, you probably had that because of Game Store connections,
2391000	2393000	but there was a way you were supposed to get it.
2393000	2395000	I don't know if it was, like, a pre-order bonus or what.
2395000	2396000	I think it was.
2396000	2398000	I think it was too.
2398000	2402000	So, anyhow, who knows what this game could be all about,
2402000	2404000	but of course when I hear Pac-Man Battle Royale,
2404000	2408000	I don't know about you guys, but I think about the old Japanese movie
2408000	2411000	where they might strand Pac-Man on a desert island with his peers
2411000	2414000	and give him only a fan to survive.
2414000	2416000	Paper plate.
2416000	2419000	That would be pretty amazing if that was actually the case,
2419000	2420000	but I somehow doubt that.
2420000	2422000	Hey, I've won Paper Plate Battle Royale.
2422000	2425000	I just can't see an M-rated Pac-Man game for the life of me.
2425000	2426000	No.
2426000	2427000	Although it would be funny.
2427000	2431000	Well, how about something that is a little bit more on the mature level,
2431000	2433000	even if it's not M-rated?
2433000	2437000	My single favorite Castlevania game ever,
2437000	2440000	Dracula X Rondo of Blood,
2440000	2442000	is coming to Virtual Console.
2442000	2444000	It's about damn time.
2444000	2446000	But, um, guess where?
2446000	2447000	Hmm.
2447000	2448000	Australia.
2448000	2450000	Hence my comment before the show.
2450000	2455000	Well, which only they heard if you're live tonight, but that's alright.
2455000	2460000	Which is very interesting because Australia has been getting a lot of bad news lately
2460000	2463000	as far as video games go, so this is kind of interesting.
2463000	2470000	Well, the OLFC actually has a rating up for,
2470000	2477000	as is titled Castlevania Rondo of Blood for Virtual Console release.
2477000	2481000	I hope that we get it over here, but I don't know.
2481000	2483000	It's such a fun game.
2483000	2487000	I mean, I hate having to break out the PC Engine every time I want to play it,
2487000	2490000	or try to find the PSP version.
2490000	2493000	Honestly, I still prefer the PC Engine version over the PSP.
2493000	2495000	If this game were to come out on Virtual Console,
2495000	2498000	wouldn't it be the first PC Engine CD game to do so?
2498000	2501000	Didn't we get, um, Ys?
2501000	2502000	No.
2502000	2506000	I'm sorry, I've got Ys Book 1 and 2 on CD.
2506000	2510000	I can't remember. There's so many games on Virtual Console now.
2510000	2512000	I'd have to look at the list.
2512000	2514000	I think Ys has been revived on the DS.
2514000	2516000	I know there's been some newer games there, or PSP,
2516000	2519000	but I don't think the originals ever came to Virtual Console.
2519000	2521000	I could be wrong. Somebody in chat might correct us.
2521000	2522000	We'll have to check.
2522000	2523000	I don't think the originals ever did.
2523000	2526000	Chatters do our dirty work for us. Go check.
2526000	2528000	Well, we're trying to talk about the news here.
2528000	2530000	But the other thing I want to point out, I mean, honestly,
2530000	2533000	if it's coming to Australia and the technology is there
2533000	2535000	and the game is going to be ported to work,
2535000	2538000	don't you think it's going to come out here before too long?
2538000	2540000	I mean, isn't that just kind of a given?
2540000	2541000	The economy still loves us.
2541000	2544000	Very rarely do these games come out in one country
2544000	2546000	and then never come out in another. You know what I mean?
2546000	2548000	Why Australia first?
2548000	2551000	Well, it could just be that maybe that's where the news has leaked.
2551000	2552000	Maybe it's really planned for everywhere,
2552000	2554000	but the news has just happened to leak for Australia.
2554000	2558000	Possibly. Maybe they had to put in their request for rating,
2558000	2559000	like some earlier date.
2559000	2562000	Right, and these ratings requests are how game announcements
2562000	2563000	leak all the freaking time.
2563000	2567000	They've tried to take measures to stop that here with the ESRB in the States,
2567000	2570000	but that doesn't change Australia, Europe, and some of the other countries
2570000	2575000	where we get our titles spoiled from.
2575000	2578000	Well, you know, I'll have that in an instant.
2578000	2580000	I know. I will actually check that out too.
2580000	2582000	It would be finally a way I can actually play this game
2582000	2585000	because I didn't collect all these systems that Dark Sakura did.
2585000	2586000	I told you to come up and play it.
2586000	2588000	I know, but it would be nice to have it in my own house.
2588000	2590000	I mean, not that I don't enjoy spending time with Dark Sakura,
2590000	2592000	but it would be nice to fire it up whenever I want.
2592000	2594000	If I want to play at 2 a.m., I don't have to call you.
2594000	2596000	Wednesday.
2596000	2599000	I don't know yet. I might actually have that day off work,
2599000	2601000	so I'll let you know. Super.
2601000	2602000	The end.
2602000	2604000	Yeah.
2604000	2609000	So Namco, they've got a lot of great games out there,
2609000	2611000	and some of those you may have missed.
2611000	2613000	And some crappy ones too, just for the record.
2613000	2616000	Some crappy ones you may have missed and may not want to play.
2616000	2618000	Would you really miss them if they're crappy?
2618000	2620000	You may not know that you've missed them.
2620000	2622000	You may just want to collect the achievements and or trophies.
2622000	2623000	Exactly.
2623000	2626000	Well, you may get your chance to do that again,
2626000	2630000	because now they're going to actually be launching their back catalog
2630000	2632000	via digital distribution.
2632000	2634000	And this is going to be happening on a few different fronts.
2634000	2636000	Of course, the Xbox 360.
2636000	2641000	They're going to be putting up me and my beautiful Katamari
2641000	2643000	sometime in the first quarter of 2010.
2643000	2645000	And then on the PlayStation Portable,
2645000	2648000	me and my Katamari on December 22nd.
2648000	2651000	So it's already out there if you want to snag that.
2651000	2654000	And of course, you know, that being said,
2654000	2659000	they're also planning on putting out other PlayStation 1 and PSP
2659000	2662000	catalog titles as well on the PlayStation Network.
2662000	2668000	And there are also maybe other titles coming to the Xbox 360 as well,
2668000	2672000	but they haven't really named names yet.
2672000	2673000	So that's kind of neat though.
2673000	2676000	More Katamari or more of the old Katamari.
2676000	2678000	Yeah, but that was like the worst Katamari game in the series.
2678000	2681000	Both of those ones you named were like the low points in the series.
2681000	2683000	Personally, I did not enjoy Beautiful Katamari.
2683000	2690000	I have friends that say I'm totally not being fair to that game and so forth.
2690000	2693000	And maybe they think there's a grudge because of the history our show has
2693000	2695000	with that particular title.
2695000	2698000	But no, I think really you put that side by side with Katamari forever
2698000	2701000	on the PS3, and it just ain't no contest.
2701000	2702000	The PS3 one's better.
2702000	2705000	Even though the PS3 one is a rehash of some of the old stuff,
2705000	2707000	I still say the PS3 one's better.
2707000	2709000	And just wait for the PS3 one to drop down in price,
2709000	2711000	because it will pretty quick.
2711000	2714000	Because it will kind of fade off pretty fast.
2714000	2719000	And you probably will be able to pick up in the new Katamari game
2719000	2722000	for 20 bucks or something.
2722000	2726000	And that's about what you're going to pay for these re-releases.
2726000	2729000	So just be patient.
2729000	2734000	Very interesting how digital distribution is kind of best known for this year.
2734000	2737000	Breathing new life into games that had slipped off the radar,
2737000	2739000	which is exactly what Namco is doing here.
2739000	2743000	But I compare this to, you know how Steam is doing their epic sale right now,
2743000	2748000	where I swear they undercut this shit down to cost just to get people in the door.
2748000	2750000	They might even be taking losses on it.
2750000	2752000	I don't know what they're doing,
2752000	2755000	but they're just trying to get as many Steam subscribers as they can.
2755000	2761000	But some of the games they're selling would have fallen off the radar a long time ago.
2761000	2766000	For example, I think they were selling the LucasArts pack for like 3 bucks,
2766000	2768000	which was the Indiana Jones games,
2768000	2771000	and Loom and all that was on sale for 3 bucks the other day.
2771000	2774000	Well, you know, yeah that might be a steal,
2774000	2777000	but at the same time for the publisher and all the sales people involved,
2777000	2780000	that's 3 bucks they probably weren't going to get,
2780000	2784000	because these games are so freaking old, who buys them anymore?
2784000	2787000	But digital distribution kind of opens it all up.
2787000	2790000	Very interesting.
2790000	2795000	Anyhow, moving on to another story and talking about digital distribution of sorts.
2795000	2801000	There is a new just launched music game store inside the Xbox Live marketplace.
2801000	2805000	This just went live I believe on the 22nd, so it was a little bit earlier this week,
2805000	2809000	but now there is a music game store within Xbox Live.
2809000	2812000	You actually can look at individual stores for Guitar Hero 5,
2812000	2816000	Guitar Hero World Tour, Band Hero, Lips, Lips No. 1 Hits,
2816000	2820000	Lego Rock Band, Beatles Rock Band, whatever rock band there is.
2820000	2824000	They all have these special front end stores where you can actually sample music tracks
2824000	2826000	and download the songs.
2826000	2828000	You might be thinking, well I can already do that in the game.
2828000	2832000	Yeah, you can, but now you can also do it through the Xbox 360 interface,
2832000	2836000	which is kind of cool that you don't have to go find the disc to put it in the drive
2836000	2838000	to sample the latest releases,
2838000	2841000	because sometimes we might be rattling off the releases here on the show,
2841000	2843000	or you read about them on the internet somewhere and you're like,
2843000	2846000	I think I remember that song and I think I remember liking it,
2846000	2847000	but I don't remember what it sounds like.
2847000	2851000	Now you can just go onto your Xbox and look at the little 30 second sample.
2851000	2854000	Interesting how music and the Xbox 360 have been fusing together
2854000	2858000	a little more and more this year, not just with this, but last FM.
2858000	2861000	If you remember from E3 though, a couple years ago,
2861000	2865000	they said that that was one of the things that they wanted to do to begin with,
2865000	2871000	was offer the multimedia interaction with the games.
2871000	2874000	So there you go.
2874000	2877000	Yeah, so I have not checked out that storefront myself,
2877000	2881000	but I'm looking at some of the screenshots and it's nice that every game
2881000	2884000	kind of gets its own little look and logo and so forth,
2884000	2887000	but where's Rock Revolution?
2887000	2889000	Just kidding. I don't care.
2889000	2891000	Where's the dedicated store?
2891000	2894000	Oh yeah, in the clearance bin. That's where it is.
2894000	2896000	$4.99.
2896000	2899000	Xbox Live should have its own little clearance bin of sorts.
2899000	2902000	Here's our dumpster, I mean, clearance bin.
2902000	2905000	It kind of looks like Borderlands. It's like just this wasteland.
2905000	2907000	I've got a great idea for Microsoft.
2907000	2909000	You can do something similar to that with Project Natal,
2909000	2914000	where you actually dig through the clearance bin with your hands,
2914000	2917000	making different gestures using the Natal camera,
2917000	2922000	so you can find the Rock Revolution in there for $4.99.
2922000	2923000	Nice.
2923000	2926000	Yeah, no one would ever get it.
2926000	2929000	Let's talk about some news about a game no one cares about.
2929000	2930000	Okay, what would that be?
2930000	2934000	Champions Online!
2934000	2940000	Actually, there is going to be a new update and an iPhone app
2940000	2944000	and a recruitment initiative.
2944000	2946000	Please play our game.
2946000	2947000	I know, right?
2947000	2950000	There is Champions Companion for the iPhone,
2950000	2955000	which you can use to review your character and see your online status,
2955000	2960000	check your friends list, your mail, read news, it's free.
2960000	2962000	There's also a referral program to where you can invite a friend
2962000	2964000	to play free for 10 days,
2964000	2969000	and you will get a rare in-game action figure, boo,
2969000	2971000	and have some combat buffs.
2971000	2973000	Ooh!
2973000	2979000	And you also get another costume slot and 400 cryptic points,
2979000	2982000	so I guess that's kind of okay.
2982000	2987000	And then they did an Attack of the Misfit Toys event over the weekend
2987000	2993000	with new costume pieces, action figures, perks, that type of stuff.
2993000	2994000	Please come play our game.
2994000	2995000	I know, right?
2995000	2998000	We need people.
2998000	3001000	I think we had a story just like this a couple weeks ago,
3001000	3003000	but it was Age of Conan.
3003000	3005000	Very similar type of thing.
3005000	3007000	They're practically giving the game away to get people to play it.
3007000	3009000	They already know where it's going to come in,
3009000	3013000	and that's going to be with Star Trek.
3013000	3015000	That's what I'm holding out for.
3015000	3017000	Ironically enough, isn't that what got a lot of people to sign up
3017000	3019000	for Champions Online in the first place,
3019000	3022000	was guaranteed access to Star Trek Online's beta or something like that?
3022000	3025000	I remember if you got an Uber subscription to Champions,
3025000	3028000	you could play Star Trek Online early or something.
3028000	3030000	You know what, that wins the whatever award.
3030000	3031000	That should have been a warning sign right there.
3031000	3034000	Because I'm already getting a beta.
3034000	3037000	Our chat room's actually lighting up with comments on the last story
3037000	3039000	because we're a little bit behind.
3039000	3041000	It takes time for what we say to encode
3041000	3043000	and you guys to hear it through the All Games feed and so forth.
3043000	3045000	They're still talking about Rock Revolution a little bit
3045000	3047000	because I was giving it a little shit in chat earlier.
3047000	3048000	Rama in chat says,
3048000	3052000	Sorry, Rock Revolution was well worth the $5 I paid for it.
3052000	3054000	Brad from Pod Culture asks,
3054000	3057000	What sucked more, Rock Revolution or Yaris?
3057000	3059000	To be fair, Yaris probably sucked more.
3059000	3065000	Yaris, but for your suck to money value...
3065000	3066000	Yaris is free.
3066000	3068000	But here's the thing though about Yaris.
3068000	3073000	Yaris led way for a whole bunch of piracy on Xbox Live Arcade.
3073000	3074000	So thank you, Yaris.
3074000	3075000	I will say this too.
3075000	3078000	Rock Revolution was actually way better than Beaten Groovy,
3078000	3082000	which you would also pay, I think, $10 for on Xbox Live Marketplace.
3082000	3084000	That game was disgusting.
3084000	3086000	It was insultingly bad.
3086000	3089000	Whoever allowed that piece of shit to go on Xbox Live Marketplace
3089000	3091000	should be ashamed of themselves
3091000	3093000	and should consider possibly retiring from the industry.
3093000	3094000	It was terrible.
3094000	3099000	It's not that difficult to make a successful music game, Konami.
3099000	3100000	I mean, you've done it in the past.
3100000	3102000	You just kind of have to copy what you did.
3102000	3104000	But somehow you just fuck it up.
3104000	3105000	And I don't know how you do that.
3105000	3106000	It's like,
3106000	3108000	Ah, they won't get it over in America.
3108000	3110000	Let's make it all ghetto looking.
3110000	3111000	Yeah, that's awesome.
3111000	3115000	Way to shit on your fans.
3115000	3118000	And trust me, we're not into that over here.
3118000	3119000	That's other countries.
3119000	3120000	Yep.
3120000	3124000	Alright, we're going to travel around the world and look at some release dates.
3124000	3126000	Hopefully some good things coming out soon.
3126000	3129000	Although, then again, it's that time of year where probably there ain't shit coming out.
3129000	3131000	I don't know, Loki. Is that the story here?
3131000	3133000	I'm pretty sure that's correct.
3133000	3135000	There is nothing coming out.
3135000	3139000	And at least last I checked, there was nothing coming out.
3139000	3142000	And if there is anything coming out this week, it's probably crap.
3142000	3146000	But, I mean, I guess if you count Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles,
3146000	3148000	the Crystal Bears came out today.
3148000	3151000	So that's something, I guess.
3151000	3159000	And supposedly this week, Divinity II Ego Draconis is supposed to be coming out on PC and Xbox 360.
3159000	3162000	I thought that was supposed to be next week, but hey.
3162000	3165000	I could be wrong because they move that stuff around all the time.
3165000	3169000	And also possibly Learn Chess and Learn Geography on the DS from Dreamcatcher,
3169000	3172000	which are probably something you can skip.
3172000	3177000	And then finally, Dreamer Zookeeper on the DS, also from Dreamcatcher.
3177000	3180000	And World Party Games coming to you on the Wii.
3180000	3183000	Yes, it's yet another party game collection.
3183000	3188000	And that's basically it, although don't be surprised if all those move to next week.
3188000	3190000	Really, it's the same story in Japan.
3190000	3192000	Literally not a damn thing coming out.
3192000	3194000	It's very quiet over there right now.
3194000	3199000	A price reduction on Tactics A2 on the DS is about all you got going for you.
3199000	3203000	And honestly, there's really not a lot to look forward to until January 9th
3203000	3206000	when Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep hits the Sony PSP.
3206000	3209000	That's probably the next big, big release over in Japan.
3209000	3212000	Yeah, I didn't find a damn thing for Europe, sorry.
3212000	3215000	It's just that time of year, folks, but we talk about them every week.
3215000	3219000	So this is a good week to go back and play the games you missed this year in 2009, yes?
3219000	3220000	Pretty much.
3220000	3221000	Pretty much.
3221000	3222000	Pretty much.
3222000	3223000	All right, so back to some news then.
3223000	3227000	Yes, so soon, and I'm not sure if this is actually going to happen
3227000	3231000	because I could think a lot of other people would be pissed off for other reasons.
3231000	3236000	But pretty soon, you may not be able to play your PSP or DS on airplanes.
3236000	3245000	Apparently, somebody is trying to consider a ban on all electronic devices aboard planes.
3245000	3253000	And apparently, the US Transport Security Administration is the one kind of doing that.
3253000	3261000	Apparently, there is a guy, Omar, I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name anyways,
3261000	3266000	the guy was arrested after failing to ignite an explosive device on Christmas Day on a plane.
3266000	3268000	Oh God, I heard about that on CNN.
3268000	3270000	So that had to do with electronic devices?
3270000	3274000	Yes, apparently, let's see.
3274000	3277000	One motherfucker always ruins it for everybody else.
3277000	3281000	You know how you can't take in water over a certain size
3281000	3285000	and your shampoo has to be in a clear bottle and in a plastic bag.
3285000	3288000	I'm not mad, I understand that they're doing it for our safety and what have you,
3288000	3292000	but it's because some asshole threatened to use it as a bomb
3292000	3296000	and said that you could use water as a...
3296000	3298000	It's just frustrating.
3298000	3307000	Apparently, it doesn't really say if it was an explosive looking like a device or something like that.
3307000	3310000	They probably don't want to tell you how he did it.
3310000	3313000	Good old fashioned American paranoia has been increased tenfold.
3313000	3318000	Following the incident, international flight passengers weren't allowed any personal items on their laps
3318000	3320000	an hour before the flight.
3320000	3326000	Full bag searches were instigated at the boarding gates and the ban on electronic devices has said,
3326000	3331000	to be a reaction to his ability to smuggle an explosive onto the plane.
3331000	3343000	This would of course mean any DS or PSP would be banned as well as anything from electronic books,
3343000	3346000	iPods, cell phones, other gaming devices, etc.
3346000	3348000	That's going to make flights so incredibly boring.
3348000	3351000	It's not going to fly.
3351000	3353000	Pun intended.
3353000	3360000	Honestly, I'm surprised he was able to do that because they scan all that stuff through...
3360000	3362000	Well, he was on an international flight.
3362000	3364000	He didn't get screened at a US airport.
3364000	3366000	He got screened at a Dutch airport.
3366000	3369000	I don't know what they do over there that's different than what they do over here,
3369000	3371000	but he didn't get in in the US.
3371000	3372000	You have a bomb.
3372000	3373000	No.
3373000	3376000	Okay, you may go.
3376000	3381000	You know, I really don't see them banning all electronics on planes.
3381000	3383000	I think that's a bit much.
3383000	3385000	And it's going to suck because I know a lot of airlines are looking into,
3385000	3387000	like I think Virgin Air or one of them,
3387000	3392000	if they're not already doing it was looking into like free Wi-Fi on flights now.
3392000	3396000	Like that's what the technology has gotten is you can get on the internet on flights,
3396000	3397000	which is pretty amazing.
3397000	3399000	And it would really suck to kind of rip that all away.
3399000	3404000	But at the end of the day, if there is a true threat, I suppose for lack of a better term,
3404000	3407000	to, you know, electronic devices on planes,
3407000	3411000	something that they can't screen for at the airport for God knows whatever reason.
3411000	3412000	Here's something.
3412000	3413000	A safety first.
3413000	3414000	Here's something to...
3414000	3416000	People didn't have laptops 20 years ago, 30 years ago.
3416000	3418000	Flights will still work, you know.
3418000	3424000	Well, what if some dude was to create an EMP bomb using electronic devices?
3424000	3427000	Can't detect that because it's not an explosive.
3427000	3428000	The plane would go down.
3428000	3429000	Exactly.
3429000	3430000	But that's the point.
3430000	3433000	They want it to explode or, you know, something.
3433000	3435000	Someone's probably thought of that.
3435000	3436000	They have something.
3436000	3439000	They don't advertise all their countermeasures.
3439000	3441000	I mean, for obvious reasons.
3441000	3446000	First of all, if anyone was going to actually be able to project an EMP
3446000	3450000	that would make a plane go down, it'd be a bigger device.
3450000	3453000	It wouldn't be something that could be hidden that easily.
3453000	3454000	I don't know.
3454000	3456000	I'm just playing devil's advocate.
3456000	3457000	No, I know.
3457000	3458000	It's just...
3458000	3461000	Although that really would be about the only thing I could think of.
3461000	3463000	SSJ-100 Matt wants to add.
3463000	3467000	Rob, he hid firecrackers in his crotch.
3467000	3471000	The Dutch screeners scanned him, but they wouldn't have found them unless they patted him down.
3471000	3472000	That seems so odd to me.
3472000	3474000	How a fucking firecracker gonna...
3474000	3477000	How many did he have in his crotch?
3477000	3481000	Maybe it was one of those things where, you know, it only takes a spark to ignite
3481000	3483000	if you have something flammable.
3483000	3484000	I don't know.
3484000	3488000	Obviously they're not telling you the details on what he was planning to do for obvious reasons,
3488000	3494000	but I still find it shocking that he was able to hide firecrackers undetected.
3494000	3497000	You know.
3497000	3500000	It sucks.
3500000	3501000	I don't know what else to say.
3501000	3502000	It sucks.
3502000	3503000	Kick dirt mound.
3503000	3506000	Wah.
3506000	3508000	This is a little less suck, although I don't know.
3508000	3510000	We'll see when the first issue comes out.
3510000	3513000	Electronic Gaming Monthly is coming back.
3513000	3516000	You might remember the plug was pulled on Electronic Gaming Monthly a few months ago
3516000	3518000	because, you know, the recession, etc., etc.
3518000	3522000	People don't read video game magazines because of the internet, etc., etc.
3522000	3524000	But Electronic Gaming Monthly apparently is coming back.
3524000	3527000	It's going to be coming back with an April issue that's released in March
3527000	3531000	because, you know, they come out a month before the actual date on the magazine.
3531000	3533000	And that's when it's coming out.
3533000	3537000	There's a press release that came out that announced that it will be coming out
3537000	3541000	and there's also going to be an eGMI, the digital magazine.
3541000	3545000	I guess there's a special code that will be in the issue that allows you to access
3545000	3550000	the digital components for exclusive article extensions and original content.
3550000	3554000	So trying to get you to buy the, you know, try to tie it into the internet.
3554000	3558000	Yeah, if it's anything like Game Informer does, it's kind of useless.
3558000	3560000	And here's my, you know, devil's advocate to this.
3560000	3562000	I applaud them for trying to do something different,
3562000	3566000	but at the same time this exclusive digital content will be reprinted
3566000	3569000	and copy-pasted somewhere else within milliseconds.
3569000	3572000	I mean, this is the age of the internet.
3572000	3577000	You're not going to put a bombshell news thing in there
3577000	3580000	and expect it not to get republished somewhere else, you know what I mean?
3580000	3581000	Yeah.
3581000	3583000	A little silly, but I don't know.
3583000	3585000	Features and things I suppose are a little harder to get.
3585000	3588000	Anyone that doesn't have a subscription to Game Informer
3588000	3592000	and pretty much if you shop at GameStop and you have one of their cards,
3592000	3596000	you have a subscription because you get it for free when you get their stupid card.
3596000	3600000	Anyways, I mean, the online portion of it is kind of useless.
3600000	3604000	I mean, they have some additional screenshots usually
3604000	3610000	or, you know, some articles or interviews or whatever, like extended interviews.
3610000	3614000	But it's nothing really like, oh my god, that's so awesome, you know, that they have on there.
3614000	3620000	It's not like Core or something like that where you get, you know, games or something like that.
3620000	3622000	I miss the old magazines with demo discs.
3622000	3625000	Of course, nowadays, you know, I used to subscribe to the Xbox magazine
3625000	3628000	because you used to get some demos that weren't available on Live,
3628000	3631000	but now they put out demos that are already available on Live.
3631000	3633000	It's like, why the fuck do I even bother?
3633000	3636000	I'm not going to buy your stupid magazine with a demo disc.
3636000	3637000	Because maybe you're still on dial-up.
3637000	3641000	You know, we've got a whole box full of old demo discs.
3641000	3644000	Now occasionally, though, they did have some free download content in there, which is kind of cool.
3644000	3647000	They had a few Oblivion expansions and stuff like that were free.
3647000	3649000	So that's kind of cool. That's a little bit of a value.
3649000	3654000	But, you know, I kind of miss the days like, well, you know, I used to buy PC Gamer too.
3654000	3656000	They used to have a whole bunch of shareware and free shit on there.
3656000	3662000	Well, wouldn't it now just be type in the code and get a demo on PSN or Xbox Live?
3662000	3663000	Yeah, they could do that.
3663000	3666000	Why bother with the cost of discs now? It's all digital.
3666000	3670000	But then again, you could just read it. They can't do that, though, because...
3670000	3672000	Well, I mean, they've done it in the past, so with...
3672000	3674000	I mean, take it a step further. What is CORE?
3674000	3678000	CORE magazine on PlayStation Network is basically just that. It's the demos and everything.
3678000	3681000	Oh, but the magazine's online too. I mean...
3681000	3685000	Yeah. The era of print is kind of going away.
3685000	3687000	Well, Electronic Human Monthly is going to try to make it last.
3687000	3692000	I mean, at the same time, you don't bring your PS3 onto the john with you,
3692000	3696000	so magazines will always at least serve a purpose there.
3696000	3700000	So if you want to pick up your bathroom reader of Electronic Gaming Monthly,
3700000	3709000	it will feature stuff by Dan, Shu, Su, Sean Baby is part of the crew as well, and so on and so on.
3709000	3711000	A lot of names you might recognize from previous years.
3711000	3714000	Oh, he did the comic, the Su and Sean comic.
3714000	3716000	I used to read those, like, all the time.
3716000	3719000	And they had a webcomic, I think, for a little while too.
3719000	3724000	Well, if you want to check that out, it will be coming out soon, so check out the newsstands.
3724000	3726000	Well, here's some other stuff you can spend your money on.
3726000	3727000	What's that?
3727000	3732000	Sackboy plushies. They are now on Amazon.
3732000	3737000	You can get a Sackboy and a Sackgirl for 20 bucks.
3737000	3743000	Ooh. But they won't have any until December 30th. Ooh.
3743000	3747000	I didn't like the look of the Sackgirl on there.
3747000	3751000	No, the Sackgirl looks stupid, but the Sackboy's pretty cute.
3751000	3756000	Yeah, because, I mean, the Sackboy is the one that's actually on the front cover, so that's kind of cool.
3756000	3761000	Yeah, I like, I think, and besides that, you know, can't she wear something other than pink?
3761000	3763000	I don't know. I guess not.
3763000	3765000	Sackboy's adorable.
3765000	3771000	Well, Team Fortress 2, if you don't have enough friends to play the game with you, Valve has the answer for you.
3771000	3774000	They are beta testing right now AI opponents.
3774000	3784000	Yes, you will be able to use some pretty intelligent bots as your opponents to fill in, you know, gaps that you may have on your team.
3784000	3793000	And apparently, I believe this is available now, and they do have some stuff you use in the console,
3793000	3800000	including ways to add people to there or remove AI players and whatnot.
3800000	3808000	But apparently they're pretty cool, and they actually, I don't know, are good replacements for people that may not be there.
3808000	3817000	And I think they've done this in, like, Counter-Strike and stuff like that, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do it here.
3817000	3818000	I don't know.
3818000	3823000	Something to keep the game going with lots of original stuff, I suppose, you know?
3823000	3827000	I'd like an offline version of Team Fortress 2 with bots. That'd be pretty fun.
3827000	3829000	Some people don't like to play online with real people.
3829000	3830000	I hate real people.
3830000	3833000	Real people can sometimes be a pain in the ass, you know?
3833000	3841000	Unless we're playing a Grand Theft Auto, which, by the way, I remember back in the day, listeners complaining that they couldn't play Grand Theft Auto with me.
3841000	3848000	Okay, I've been playing ranked games now almost every day. None of our listeners are playing.
3848000	3850000	What's up with that?
3850000	3859000	It's free to play now. We play 10 AM and 3 PM Pacific around there within probably about half an hour or so.
3859000	3864000	And just a ranked deathmatch in the Ballad of Gay Tony.
3864000	3871000	And feel free to join our game because we want to give out your gamertag to LokiOLR.
3871000	3873000	All one word.
3873000	3880000	Feel free. You can't really be invited into the game. You just have to join a ranked game.
3880000	3884000	Trust me, there's hardly anyone playing right now. It's really easy to join the game.
3884000	3891000	So you can just see if I'm online, most likely playing Grand Theft Auto, join the game, and prepare to get your ass kicked.
3891000	3893000	Nice. It's so modest.
3893000	3897000	Alright, Loki's throwing down the gauntlet here on OLR. Check it out.
3897000	3901000	Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
3901000	3906000	And this has to do with, remember last week it came up that the PSP 4000 was on its way out.
3906000	3918000	This coming from an advertisement that ran in a magazine that showed that this upcoming, I think, LittleBigPlanet thing was going to work on PSP 1000, 2000, 3000, the GO, and the OMG, what is this PSP 4000?
3918000	3924000	Well, by the way, they've come out and said, of course, deny, deny, deny.
3924000	3932000	It's come out, apparently, that the Sony PSP 4000 mention was a mistake on their part.
3932000	3936000	There is no new model of the PSP under construction.
3936000	3938000	Uh huh, sure, whatever you say, dude.
3938000	3954000	Yes, just like they didn't have an icon or whatever like that that was also available on Sony's website as well that someone found by changing the file name or whatever of the PSP 3000 icon on there.
3954000	3956000	The 4000, oh look, it shows up.
3956000	3970000	Also, Sony came out and said, oh yeah, this is not true, and then the company that put out the ad said, oh yeah, this is not true, but come on, if they were really going to put it out, and this company leaked it out, wouldn't they be telling the company, deny everything!
3970000	3979000	Yeah, I know, the response coming here is like, I don't know, I don't know what you're talking about, crazy people, 4000!
3979000	3984000	Whether they do or not, let me put it this way, it's not going to be significant either way, so...
3984000	3991000	Alright, Sony, you're not coming out with a 4000, I will pretend to be surprised when you announce the 4000.
3991000	3993000	Just like with the Go.
3993000	3999000	We're not doing a UMD Listio PSP with a sliding screen, that's preposterous!
3999000	4002000	Oh, by the way, the PSP Go is coming out now.
4002000	4005000	Here comes E3, lol gotcha!
4005000	4009000	Oh, 4000, you didn't see that one coming, no!
4009000	4013000	I think they should name it the 4001 just to spite everybody.
4013000	4017000	Sony, if you're listening, seriously, that is how you could get the last laugh.
4017000	4021000	Because we all know you're doing it now, just suck it up.
4021000	4024000	Name it the PSP 4001.
4024000	4027000	And lol.
4027000	4032000	Alright, we're going to take some time here on the show to respect the classics.
4032000	4038000	It is time for the very last classic game of the week of the decade.
4038000	4041000	No, this segment will be back in 2010, of course it will.
4041000	4047000	But this is a chance for Dark Soccer to dig through the gaming archives and pick a game from Gaming gesture here that she says,
4047000	4053000	Damn it, you ungrateful kids these days in your newfangled 360s and PS3s,
4053000	4057000	you need to go play the games we used to play back in my day.
4057000	4059000	And then she'll run over you with her walker, right?
4059000	4063000	I went, no, I went for Epic Old School Awesome.
4063000	4066000	Alright, so what is the Epic Old School Awesome video game of the week?
4066000	4070000	The video game of the week is Salamander.
4070000	4072000	I'm pretty sure I haven't done Salamander yet.
4072000	4073000	I don't think you have either.
4073000	4074000	Which is a shame.
4074000	4076000	Well, then here is a little clip of Salamander.
4076000	4077000	Let's listen to the intro.
4077000	4086000	Pick it up for multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple.
4086000	4091000	Pick it up for a fourth, pick it up for Ripple Waker.
4091000	4092000	Which is the arcade version.
4092000	4094000	Now what is this Dark Soccer?
4094000	4096000	This is just Life Force, right?
4096000	4101000	Actually, yes, Life Force is the name it came out with in North America.
4101000	4106000	So it's a spinoff from the Gradia series.
4106000	4114000	And it actually switches between horizontal and vertically scrolling areas.
4114000	4116000	So you've got kind of a little bit of both.
4116000	4121000	It also has a more simplified power-up system, too.
4121000	4124000	And you can play two-player co-op, which is great.
4124000	4127000	And that's in all of the stages, by the way.
4127000	4134000	So Player 1 is the Vic Viper, and Player 2 is the Lord British.
4134000	4137000	And actually, did you know that there's a Salamander anime?
4137000	4139000	Wait, they really called one of the ships the Lord British?
4139000	4140000	Yeah.
4140000	4142000	Like the same guy who did Ultima Lord British?
4142000	4145000	I don't know.
4145000	4149000	Yeah, because when I hear Lord British, I think it's the dude who did Ultima back in the day.
4149000	4155000	At any rate, well, you've got the Vic Viper and Lord British.
4155000	4161000	And you play through six stages, and like I said, it alternates between horizontal and vertical.
4161000	4170000	You can actually continue from where you left off upon death instead of the checkpoint version that Gradius has.
4170000	4175000	You do not have any continues in Salamander's mode when you play single,
4175000	4181000	but you have two continues in two-player mode, though you can actually change it in the settings.
4181000	4184000	You also have different power-ups, like I said.
4184000	4194000	And you just pick up the capsule that you want of the power-up instead of selecting it like you do in Gradius.
4194000	4197000	You know, how you can pick a double or let them save up.
4197000	4201000	By the way, this is the most epic beating of this boss ever.
4201000	4206000	I was going to say, whoever's doing this playthrough here off this YouTube, it's user Succula.
4206000	4211000	S-U-C-C-U-L-L-A is the YouTuber we're looking at here in the studio right now where the music's coming from.
4211000	4216000	Epic! This person knows what the fuck they're doing with this game. They know where it's at.
4216000	4220000	Well, on top of that, just like any of the Gradius games, especially with the bosses,
4220000	4229000	there are little hidey places that you can go to and ways to lure the boss or whatever to where you need it to be.
4229000	4235000	And if I'm right, I think this is a one-playthrough beating of this game, which is really freaking difficult.
4235000	4238000	I love the laser. That was my favorite weapon.
4238000	4240000	I just freaking love Life Force on the NES.
4240000	4244000	I mean, I realize it has its roots different places, but I remember it as Life Force on the NES.
4244000	4246000	Well, I've got it.
4246000	4247000	Rob, if you want to play it?
4247000	4250000	Oh yeah, I know. I remember seeing it in the vault.
4250000	4259000	I just kind of, you know, I like the voice in this one, but I miss the double, you know, option and all that.
4259000	4262000	Or speed up, you know, but anyway.
4262000	4270000	So you've got different backgrounds, you have star fields, you've got all kinds of different stuff.
4270000	4279000	There's actually some big differences between the Japanese version and the European version and Life Force.
4279000	4291000	The Japanese and European versions are pretty much the same except the American version changes the plot to the game by having some opening text
4291000	4298000	where you're actually going inside a giant alien life form to fight off bacteria.
4298000	4306000	And so the star fields from Salamander were actually changed to kind of a web background so that it looks more organic.
4306000	4308000	I'm sure you remember that, Rob, don't you?
4308000	4309000	Yes.
4309000	4318000	Power ups have different names. You have speed up becoming hyperspeed, missile becoming struck to missile, the ripple laser becoming pulse laser, and force field becoming shield.
4318000	4320000	OMG, I love the fire level.
4320000	4321000	Yeah.
4321000	4325000	Sorry, they're in stage three right now on their epic play through and oof, I love the fire level.
4325000	4329000	There should be a link to level four, and actually level four, Rob, I wish you would have placed at the beginning of that.
4329000	4330000	There should be this Saturn note.
4330000	4333000	Sure, you want to skip ahead a little bit here? We'll get to the fourth one.
4333000	4337000	Yeah, but this music you'll recognize from B-Mania.
4337000	4346000	Okay.
4346000	4349000	That music right now was in the song under B-crush music.
4349000	4350000	Nice.
4350000	4355000	And actually stage four has my favorite music in the game.
4355000	4376000	But some other differences, your power ups were modified a little bit to where you have the same for life force, the Japanese life force, you actually had the same power up as Gradius.
4376000	4389000	Some music was changed. You can, however, get the original Japanese version and the enhanced life force with the salamander deluxe pack that came out for PlayStation and Saturn and salamander portable on PSP.
4389000	4399000	So yeah, we have the NES version, which actually came out in 87.
4399000	4409000	It actually, though, just took bits from salamander and life force to kind of make it a bit of a new concept in the game.
4409000	4420000	It actually, we got the port for the NES, and it's exactly the same, except it doesn't have multiple endings like the Japanese one does, and it's just called life force.
4420000	4426000	All of these use the Konami code, and the NES version is out on the virtual console.
4426000	4432000	500 Wii points, go get it. There's an MSX version that's pretty different.
4432000	4444000	You have different pilots for each of the ships, which if I do remember correctly, I think that it was from the MSX version that the anime was based off of.
4444000	4448000	It's been a long time since I've watched the anime. We've got it on DVD somewhere.
4448000	4456000	There's also a PC Engine version. You actually have checkpoints in this one, faster anime animations.
4456000	4460000	Actually, they improved some of the music from the arcade version.
4460000	4467000	Ocean Software brought it out for the Spectrum Commodore in Amstrad in 1988.
4467000	4477000	But the Commodore 64 version, Rob, you may be particularly happy to find out, was pretty much considered one of the best of the PC ports.
4477000	4481000	Of course, like I said, it came out on the PlayStation and Saturn.
4481000	4487000	We got the Salamander Deluxe Pack, and also included with that was Salamander 2.
4487000	4490000	So that was Salamander, Life Force, and Salamander 2.
4490000	4500000	PSP, we got Salamander Portable, which had actually a few other kind of rare games in it.
4500000	4509000	It had Salamander, Life Force, Salamander 2, Zexix, I think that's what it's called? Zexix, Zexis? X-E-X-E-X?
4509000	4510000	Yeah, yeah.
4510000	4511000	It's a game I haven't played in a long time.
4511000	4517000	And the MSX version of Gradius 2, which came out, I think, as Nemesis 2.
4517000	4522000	Which has nothing to do with the arcade Gradius 2.
4522000	4526000	And for the record, Gradius 2 on PC Engine? Excellent.
4526000	4530000	Anyway, so yeah, here's actually the thing about the anime in here.
4530000	4538000	There was an OAV, and it had to do with, it had the different characters in it.
4538000	4545000	There was a character named Stephanie, and Lord British's ship was actually named after a character called Lord British.
4545000	4548000	So, it was Lord British's space destroyer.
4548000	4551000	I think it does have to do with the guy behind Ultima.
4551000	4553000	At least some of the folks in chat are indicating too.
4553000	4556000	That's really interesting, because he had nothing to do with Konami, I thought.
4556000	4557000	Yeah.
4557000	4560000	Well, there's also a couple good soundtracks too.
4560000	4562000	There's a Salamander arcade soundtrack.
4562000	4569000	There is the original Sound of Salamander, and Salamander again, Konami Kukeha Club.
4569000	4572000	Which, you know, they did a few games from that series.
4572000	4574000	I mean, a few soundtracks from that series.
4574000	4575000	So there you go.
4575000	4577000	Yummy.
4577000	4580000	Lots of Salamander-y things.
4580000	4584000	And also, I freaking love the cover of the soundtrack.
4584000	4586000	I mean, look at that and tell me that's not awesome.
4586000	4588000	I'm gonna link it in chatroom.
4588000	4591000	Yes, it's like a big demon face thing.
4591000	4592000	Kinda scary, actually, a little bit.
4592000	4594000	It's like an evil snake.
4594000	4595000	Alright.
4595000	4597000	Which really has nothing to do with the Salamander, I guess.
4597000	4601000	Other than being, you know, reptiles, I guess, maybe?
4601000	4604000	Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Salamander.
4604000	4609000	Which is available on a variety of different systems, but if you want to play the original, go play the arcade version.
4609000	4612000	You can find it if you know where to look.
4612000	4615000	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4615000	4616000	We're not done yet.
4616000	4617000	In fact, we're gonna be back.
4617000	4618000	We still have some rapid-fire news.
4618000	4620000	Your Twitter topics.
4620000	4624000	And then we're gonna take a break from the news tonight and talk a little bit about what's happened this year.
4624000	4627000	Talk about our picks for game of the year.
4627000	4628000	And donuts.
4628000	4630000	And you wanna talk about donuts?
4630000	4631000	I just want one.
4631000	4632000	I want a donut, too.
4632000	4633000	I also want a pony.
4633000	4635000	Let's make dang, let's make dang, I have a pony, Rob.
4635000	4636000	Did I tell you that?
4636000	4638000	Okay, I have to share this.
4638000	4639000	Alright, yes.
4639000	4643000	For our team builder, we did our annual present exchange.
4643000	4647000	And we were given these little pieces of paper that says, write down what you want.
4647000	4650000	So I'm like, you know, so that whoever gets our name doesn't buy us crap.
4650000	4655000	And I was like, okay, I want an Amazon gift card, or this gift card, or this gift card, or a pony.
4655000	4659000	So someone, the person who got me, got me a toy pony.
4659000	4661000	That's awesome.
4661000	4663000	And then a gift card to Barnes & Noble, so.
4663000	4664000	Nice.
4664000	4665000	But I finally got my pony.
4665000	4667000	That means I have to stop asking for one at restaurants.
4667000	4669000	When they say, what can I get you tonight?
4669000	4670000	I need a pony.
4670000	4671000	Do you need anything else?
4671000	4673000	Yeah, I'd like a pony, please.
4673000	4677000	I'm going to have to stick with either the llama or the pygmy goat.
4677000	4679000	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys.
4679000	4685000	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in the year and the decade in review in just a few minutes.
4690000	4696000	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, December the 27th of 2009,
4696000	4700000	where we're taping the 350th episode of our show.
4700000	4706000	And, yes, it's the very last Orange Lounge Radio of the decade, but we'll be back next week, as always, to do it all again.
4706000	4710000	And since it is the last OLR of the decade and it's been a little bit of a slow news week,
4710000	4716000	we're going to take some time to reflect on our favorite games of the year and of the decade.
4716000	4722000	But, meanwhile, we do have a few other news stories we want to get to real quick in a segment we call the Rapid Fire News.
4722000	4724000	And, of course, we'll get to your Twitter topics, too.
4724000	4727000	If you haven't sent us your tweets yet, hurry up and do that, because we're going to get to those very soon,
4727000	4730000	as soon as we get out our Rapid Fire News. So, Loki.
4730000	4739000	Yes. Well, if you're looking for something to do shortly after the new year, you can perhaps join the MAG beta,
4739000	4746000	which was previously not available to everybody, but starting January 4th will be.
4746000	4751000	And you will be able to download it on the PlayStation Network.
4751000	4756000	Existing beta members will be able to update their files to prepare for the upcoming trial,
4756000	4761000	which means that you shouldn't delete any of your MAG data if you are already in the beta.
4761000	4769000	And, apparently, the beta is pretty short, though. It is only lasting a week until, well, slightly under a week, until January 10th.
4769000	4778000	But you will be able to play 64-player sabotage matches and also 256-player domination matches.
4778000	4784000	So, that's kind of neat. And then, of course, the end of the game will be coming out shortly after that.
4784000	4787000	So, on the 26th.
4787000	4794000	Also, on the PlayStation Network will be coming Holy Invasion of Privacy Bad Man 2.
4794000	4799000	And what's kind of cool about it, as well, is that you will not only be able to get the sequel,
4799000	4803000	but the first game will be included with it for free.
4803000	4808000	And that is, of course, if you get it via the PlayStation Network.
4808000	4815000	No word, though, if, when they decide to put this out as an actual UMD, if the original game will appear on there, as well.
4815000	4823000	But, at least right now, is kind of a nice bonus for, I guess, people who may own, like, the PSP Go, and that's their only option.
4823000	4825000	So, that's kind of neat.
4825000	4830000	And then, finally, in un-Sony PlayStation News,
4830000	4836000	Crackdown 2 is scheduled to be coming out the first half of 2010, which makes me all sorts of happy.
4836000	4844000	And no word exactly yet when it's going to be coming, but apparently it was revealed on Major Nelson's weekly podcast
4844000	4856000	that Xbox's head, Aaron Greenberg, apparently is saying that Mass Effect 2, Splinter Cell Conviction, and Alan Wake,
4856000	4862000	and apparently also Crackdown 2 are scheduled for the first part of the year.
4862000	4866000	So, I guess Alan Wake isn't coming out later in the year like I had thought.
4866000	4869000	Probably second quarter, if I'd guess correctly.
4869000	4872000	Alright, well, some other games coming out before too long.
4872000	4876000	Resonance of Fate, some folks might be interested in this, is by TriAce.
4876000	4882000	This is already available as a demo on the Japanese PlayStation Network or the Japanese Xbox 360.
4882000	4886000	So, if you have a Japanese PSN account or you have a way of getting onto the...
4886000	4890000	I guess the Xbox is a little better now at blocking the non-Japanese stuff, but...
4890000	4891000	Eh, not very good at that.
4891000	4894000	Whatever you can do to get in there, you can do that to download that demo.
4894000	4898000	If you haven't already heard about this game, it's coming out from SEGA is publishing it.
4898000	4901000	It's kind of like a gunplay style RPG.
4901000	4909000	So, check that out, Resonance of Fate, now available in Japan or for those of you crafty folks over in other countries who know how to get in anyway.
4909000	4913000	LoL, Eye of Judgment, yes, it's coming out on the PSP.
4913000	4920000	But, no camera, no cards, and apparently, I'm not sure the UMD is really going to be there either.
4920000	4923000	Legends is just going to be on the PlayStation Store.
4923000	4925000	It's going to be there in the spring of 2010.
4925000	4929000	It'll have 300 digital cards, 30 that are unique on the PSP.
4929000	4931000	No UMD release expected at this time.
4931000	4933000	It's only going to be a digital download.
4933000	4938000	That doesn't mean it's only playable on the go, because remember, if you have a big enough memory card on the 3000...
4938000	4940000	That's all you need.
4940000	4942000	Is that included in the bet?
4942000	4944000	Ooh, good question.
4944000	4948000	No, and the reason why is because it's not as ridiculous as Eye of Judgment.
4948000	4952000	Whereas this, you know, is an actual game that can be played like a traditional game.
4952000	4957000	It's not something that's, you know, a card game with this extra camera crap that's added on top of it.
4957000	4959000	I will give Loki that. I mean, let's face it.
4959000	4965000	Part of what made the first game so preposterous was the fact that, you know, you're playing this card game with a camera, and I think that's why he took the bet in the first place.
4965000	4968000	PSP's deleting all that weird shit out.
4968000	4979000	Yeah, it's actually a game. It'd be almost like a translation of a Magic the Gathering game, whereas, you know, Eye of Judgment, I can imagine, would be played without the camera and all that extra crap.
4979000	4984000	Fair enough, guys. Let's just face it. Loki's never going to lose that bet. At least not in this decade.
4984000	4987000	It's never going to happen, period. They've stopped making the game.
4987000	4989000	Alright.
4989000	4993000	Silent Night is the name of a new expansion that came out on Quake Live this week.
4993000	4997000	And, as you can imagine, it makes everybody fit for the holidays.
4997000	5001000	Like, I guess if you want to shoot Santa Claus or one of his little helpers, you can kind of do that there.
5001000	5008000	It's going to be there for two weeks, and it's a remake of a Team Arena Distance Screams. They're now calling it Silent Night.
5008000	5013000	So, don't expect any new weapons or any significant changes to gameplay.
5013000	5020000	It's just like, you know, La La La, Winter Wonderland, etc., etc., candy canes and so forth for you to blow your friends away to.
5020000	5022000	Have fun with that.
5022000	5024000	Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?
5024000	5026000	Some stuff.
5026000	5028000	Stuff like and such as?
5028000	5034000	Well, Sega's having like a big sale in their Wii Shop channel.
5034000	5043000	You should have some of the games like Sonic 1, 2, 3, Gunstar Heroes, Streets of Rage 2, PLPO2.
5043000	5047000	Basically, they're going to be five bucks until January 6th.
5047000	5052000	So, each of them are three dollars less than usual, and I think they just want to make some money.
5052000	5055000	So, go buy them.
5055000	5065000	And as far as other stuff going on, there is a New Year's theme for free on Xbox Live, which it's pretty colorful.
5065000	5071000	Dan was using it for a little while. It has a big ball on top of the building. Ooh.
5071000	5084000	Also, they have some other things to go with the New Year that's supposed to, you have to pay for them, like the 2010 Avatar glasses.
5084000	5090000	And there's also the Deal of the Day stuff, like I believe it was the other day, it was Worms 2.
5090000	5092000	Some other stuff.
5092000	5102000	And then, last but not least, and actually this is I think the best news of all, is there is a country pack for Rock Band,
5102000	5108000	but who cares about the country crap because there's also a Paul McCartney set in there as well.
5108000	5117000	So, that's actually, it's actually December 29th is the country pack, which Alan Jackson's Good Time,
5117000	5124000	Cross Canadian Ragweed, Cry Lonely, Jason, Aldi and She's Country, Keith Urban, I Told You So.
5124000	5127000	That seems to be like the only good thing in the whole packet.
5127000	5132000	Kenny Rogers, The Gambler, okay, maybe Kenny Rogers, classic.
5132000	5136000	Martina McBride, this one's for the girls, Shania Twain, Any Man of Mine, blah, blah, blah.
5136000	5142000	But the Paul McCartney pack is going to be out on January 5th or January 7th for PS3 owners.
5142000	5151000	Haha, we'll get it first, Xbox, Xbox. You also get, for that set you get Band on the Run, the live, actually all these are live versions.
5151000	5155000	This is from the Paul McCartney New York City concert.
5155000	5159000	But there's Band on the Run, Jet, and Sing the Changes.
5159000	5169000	All of those are going to be 160, sorry, Xbox points or 200 Wii points each.
5169000	5177000	And these are actually, there's no telling if they're going to be available for Lego Rock Band.
5177000	5179000	Alright.
5179000	5183000	I can't wait until January 5th.
5183000	5187000	We'll start off the year with a bang, or a few guitar strums, whatever the case may be.
5187000	5189000	Let's get into some Twitter topics.
5189000	5195000	We've been taking some of your submissions over Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R for some things we might have missed so far in the show.
5195000	5200000	And some random asked questions such as this first one from Blue Swim who tweets us,
5200000	5208000	If you could bring only one celebrity who died during the O's decade back to life, who would it be and why?
5208000	5216000	He continues on to tweet, I'd bring Heath Ledger back to life so he could reprise his role as the Joker in the new Batman movies again.
5216000	5225000	Gosh, I don't know. To think all the way back throughout the entire decade of the O's, that's a long time.
5225000	5229000	A lot of people die, death just kind of happens, so I'm not sure.
5229000	5232000	If you could bring back only one celebrity, he specifically said a celebrity.
5232000	5235000	Anybody that comes to mind for any of you?
5235000	5237000	I honestly, I'm drawing a blank.
5237000	5239000	I don't care.
5239000	5242000	Yeah, it's kind of a weird thought.
5242000	5255000	What if one of the celebrities that if they were suddenly back, if their very presence, alive, disrupted the entire time space continuum?
5255000	5257000	Or if they got brought back as a zombie.
5257000	5263000	No, Rob. Then we'd have to shoot them in the head and we couldn't remember them in a nice way.
5263000	5271000	I would like to see, um, God, the name escapes me right now, a totally famous guy, the guy that was with the NRA, not from my cold dead hands.
5271000	5276000	Charlton Heston, was that it? I'd like to see him reanimated as a zombie. I think that's the celebrity from the O's.
5276000	5281000	I want to see Brittany Whatcherfuck come back as a zombie so we can shoot her.
5281000	5284000	Rude, rude, rude.
5284000	5295000	You know, this is my whole thing. I understand mourning the loss of, like, someone's contribution, but you didn't know the person, you know?
5295000	5299000	Very good suggestion from chat. We have a couple people yelling out, Phil Hartman.
5299000	5302000	That was a very tragic thing that happened.
5302000	5309000	This is my whole thing. When people die, it's typically when they're supposed to.
5309000	5317000	Even if it might seem stupid, it's just, it happens when it happens, so I don't see any point in wishing for something that's not going to happen.
5317000	5323000	And since then, I really don't want to see anyone reanimated. I mean, just the whole zombie thing totally makes me want to puke.
5323000	5325000	Loki, was there something smartass you wanted to add?
5325000	5330000	No, I just had to see when someone died, so just checking real quick.
5330000	5331000	Dammit!
5331000	5335000	That was in 94. No John Candy, unfortunately.
5335000	5342000	I guess I'm going to have to go with my original thought, which was Michael Jackson, because I'd like to see him do his actual comeback.
5342000	5347000	And, you know, all sorts of fun that would be involved with that.
5347000	5355000	Alright, let's see. SSJ100Matt sent us this on Twitter, which is a link to a story.
5355000	5357000	Police followed an Xbox trail...
5357000	5360000	Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I take that back. I renege that.
5360000	5363000	I would like to see, um...
5363000	5365000	Oh, god, what's his name?
5370000	5373000	The chatroom is correcting themselves, by the way. Phil Hartman died in 98.
5373000	5377000	Yeah, not Phil Hartman.
5377000	5381000	The other guy, the other pitchman.
5381000	5382000	Billy Mays.
5382000	5384000	Hi, Billy Mays here.
5384000	5385000	As a zombie.
5385000	5387000	No, not as a zombie.
5387000	5391000	Did you see that episode of South Park? Brilliant, that show.
5391000	5394000	Anyhow, back to SSJ100Matt's tweet, thank you very much.
5394000	5401000	Sent us to a story from Lohud.com talking about police following an Xbox trail.
5401000	5406000	I guess because this guy in the Bronx was playing with a stolen Xbox 360 game system,
5406000	5412000	it led them to a stash of stolen property, 200 car break-ins, and a couple of burglaries.
5412000	5415000	They were very excited to recover all this.
5415000	5418000	They went to... Oh, I love when they give the address in the story.
5418000	5424000	It was 4064 Laconia Avenue in the Bronx is where all this stuff was hiding, apparently.
5424000	5430000	They got a search warrant. They traced through Microsoft and the ISP where this stolen Xbox was being played from,
5430000	5435000	and it led them to a GPS system, laptop computers, and all this stuff.
5435000	5443000	It looks like all this stuff was retrieved from 22-year-old Jeremiah Gilliam's bedroom.
5443000	5447000	To Jeremiah Gilliam, we say, uh-huh.
5447000	5449000	Next time, don't be stupid.
5449000	5455000	Stealing things is pretty stupid in the first place, but then when you go and play with the stolen goods on the internet,
5455000	5458000	that just makes you stupid or stupid.
5458000	5461000	But let's face it, you're pretty stupid when you're stealing shit in the first place.
5461000	5462000	That makes someone extra stupid.
5462000	5466000	He probably wouldn't think that they would be tracking the system,
5466000	5472000	and it's almost likely that they wouldn't know what the system serial number and that kind of stuff was,
5472000	5476000	but apparently they were able to track that via history and stuff like that.
5476000	5480000	Dedication to them for trying to get it back to the Xbox 360.
5480000	5486000	We got a link from DJ Rama S on Twitter. He's linking us to another local New York thing.
5486000	5489000	This is coming from Gizmodo, which is kind of interesting.
5489000	5493000	It has to do with the iPhone, which some would argue is pretty much a gaming device in this day and age.
5493000	5500000	Apparently, the iPhone is not purchasable on AT&T's website if you use a New York City zip code,
5500000	5506000	because according to a rep at, I guess, online, New York is not ready for the iPhone.
5506000	5510000	You've heard about all these types of complaints where in New York City they can't handle the iPhone bandwidth.
5510000	5515000	Calls are getting dropped left and right and all this crazy stuff, so yikes.
5515000	5523000	But their 3G is better. Their commercials say so. Am I to believe that Luke Wilson is lying to me?
5523000	5532000	I can't handle that. That's shocking that they would misrepresent themselves like that.
5532000	5538000	Just to point out, though, Gizmodo kind of continues to say that, hey, San Francisco also has a lot of problems,
5538000	5543000	and you can still get an iPhone in San Francisco, so why New York is being singled out, who knows.
5543000	5547000	I think it's probably just some type of weird, creepy bug.
5547000	5552000	I don't think AT&T is going to acknowledge that this has any weight to it whatsoever.
5552000	5555000	But apparently, also, Tigerclaw wants to add in our chat room.
5555000	5562000	You can still go into a phone and get a, or, sorry, still go into a phone, still go into a store and get the phone that way.
5562000	5565000	A little strange.
5565000	5569000	Anyhow, also going to some other news stories that were submitted.
5569000	5579000	Ray Ayanami sends us this link to Ketsuie, was announced for the Japanese Xbox 360s at what's called the Cave Festival.
5579000	5581000	So this is a shooting game.
5581000	5588000	Ketsuie Kizuna Jigoku Tachi Extra is coming out on the 360.
5588000	5596000	That'll cost you about $50, and it's another shmup that's coming to the Xbox 360, which has been getting a lot of those.
5596000	5601000	But you can see some screenshots online at this shmups.system11.org web forum,
5601000	5607000	where they actually show people playing at Akihabara at the Cave Festival this new game.
5607000	5610000	And there's even some footage on the internets, but there's a lot of background noise.
5610000	5612000	I don't want to play that for you right now.
5612000	5617000	A couple stories coming to us from Tigerclaw305, who is sending us some stories about, let's see,
5617000	5623000	Timegate has sued South Peak for royalties and breach of contract.
5623000	5627000	Apparently this is the folks who developed Section 8, Timegate Studios.
5627000	5630000	They have sued South Peak because of a breach of contract.
5630000	5639000	Apparently the publisher is withholding royalty payments and violates the deal with a PS3 porting deal with a Russian company.
5639000	5641000	My gosh.
5641000	5646000	Let's see, Timegate wants compensatory damages.
5646000	5651000	According to the report, South Peak says that because they got in 2008 Gamecock,
5651000	5656000	it exempts it from some of the specifics of the original agreement.
5656000	5660000	So yet more legal troubles.
5660000	5662000	It'll be settled out of court. They always are.
5662000	5666000	That's how those things go, yeah?
5666000	5668000	That's what'll happen.
5668000	5675000	Let's see, also what's also very interesting, the CEO of 3D Realms has teased a Duke Nukem resurgence.
5675000	5677000	Oh God, here we go again.
5677000	5681000	Apparently numerous Duke Nukem games are in various stages of development.
5681000	5684000	Gosh, does that include Duke Nukem Forever?
5684000	5690000	Funny that you should mention Duke Nukem because remember there was supposed to be the PSP and DS versions that were coming out in September.
5690000	5692000	Oh, but those have been delayed.
5692000	5693000	Just like Duke Nukem.
5693000	5700000	Now I want to point out the CEO of 3D Realms did go out of his way to point out Duke Nukem Forever was not technically cancelled.
5700000	5706000	Yes, we released the initial team, but that doesn't correlate to the demise of the project.
5706000	5707000	Great.
5707000	5712000	So this will be now what our third decade of Duke Nukem Forever rumors we're going to get into.
5712000	5715000	Goody goody.
5715000	5718000	Our good friend Marin Marvel has tweeted us and said,
5718000	5722000	What do you guys think about the Blizzard Authenticator?
5722000	5725000	I think it's a really good idea. I hate to say it.
5725000	5730000	I had my account hacked and I will never undo the Authenticator because of it.
5730000	5733000	Especially if you're an iPhone or iTouch user, it's free.
5733000	5739000	And to get a free pet out of it, and even if you don't have an iPhone or an iTouch, it's like $6.50 for the keychain.
5739000	5747000	Which, you know, considering they're also charging $10 for a pet, it's not a bad deal and it does keep your account relatively safe.
5747000	5754000	I think it's unfortunate that Blizzard won't do more against these gold spammers and things, but unfortunately what they're doing,
5754000	5762000	they're hacking a lot of American accounts and going into the games and rolling level one characters and doing all the shouts and so forth.
5762000	5763000	How well does the app work?
5763000	5764000	Huh?
5764000	5765000	How well does the app work?
5765000	5770000	Never had a problem with it. Pretty much all you do, you boot it up and it brings you up the code right away.
5770000	5772000	But is that one that you have to pay for?
5772000	5773000	No. It's a free app.
5773000	5774000	Well then I'll just download it right now.
5774000	5778000	Yeah, so I mean, honestly, if you have the iPhone or iTouch, there's no reason not to have it.
5778000	5784000	Except for, you know, if you're away from that device a lot, like especially if you're an iTouch user, you're not always with your iTouch.
5784000	5787000	But if you're with your iPhone, I mean, I have my phone with me pretty much everywhere I go.
5787000	5790000	So, I see no reason not to have it there.
5790000	5798000	But I just think it sucks that the burden is on me to prevent my account from getting hacked.
5798000	5804000	I do think some of the burden, I mean, I am, you know, you can point and laugh at me all you want for having my account hacked.
5804000	5806000	But I like to think I'm a pretty intelligent web user.
5806000	5809000	I know the basics about phishing and websites.
5809000	5813000	And I know, I do not to this day know how my account got hacked.
5813000	5817000	And it kind of freaks me out because I hope they didn't get my email or other things as well.
5817000	5820000	I just, I wish Blizzard would sue people.
5820000	5825000	I wish they would just start blocking IPs from maybe regions that are in America.
5825000	5827000	I mean, I hate to say it, but you know what?
5827000	5829000	There is WoW localized for other regions.
5829000	5834000	So, maybe it's time to start locking players out from certain regions.
5834000	5837000	I hate to say it, but if that's the way we're going to prevent.
5837000	5841000	But, you know, you can always IP spoof and all this other crazy stuff.
5841000	5844000	But I just wish the burden wasn't on us.
5844000	5847000	But hey, it's free.
5847000	5853000	Lastly, one more question from Jazajazz on Twitter.
5853000	5856000	Where do you think games are headed in the new year?
5856000	5860000	Digital distribution is going to be huge in the next decade.
5860000	5865000	I think a lot of these game stores are going to have to change their business model.
5865000	5867000	Or there's a lot to lose in the coming decade.
5867000	5870000	I think digital distribution is going to be huge in the upcoming next few years.
5870000	5872000	I think that's where games are headed, online.
5872000	5875000	Low-key Dark Soccer?
5875000	5878000	I agree. Honestly, we've been seeing it happen more and more.
5878000	5881000	Especially since Sony has been really adopting it.
5881000	5884000	Yeah, probably more digital distribution.
5884000	5886000	But I don't really think things are going to change too much.
5886000	5888000	They're probably going to try to push 3D.
5888000	5890000	Because that's the next big thing.
5890000	5895000	And now with the two...
5895000	5898000	I don't really see...
5898000	5900000	Truly next-gen consoles.
5900000	5903000	I found the Wii's kind of recycled hardware, if you ask me.
5903000	5908000	But now they're coming out with their 3D controllers.
5908000	5911000	So that's really going to be the pushes for 3D.
5911000	5916000	And you're going to see almost a new console generation being formed from this.
5916000	5921000	Yeah, I honestly would not expect to see all new consoles until 2013-14.
5921000	5923000	I mean, it's going to be a ways out.
5923000	5925000	Especially with these motion and stuff.
5925000	5926000	Except for Nintendo.
5926000	5927000	Unless...
5927000	5929000	I think Nintendo will have something very soon.
5929000	5932000	Unless this just flops and dies, you know.
5932000	5936000	And I think from Nintendo, I don't think we're going to see anything really new.
5936000	5940000	You know, it's probably just going to be an upgrade.
5940000	5944000	I want to point out some comments from our chat room on some of those tweets.
5944000	5947000	Misty wants to point out in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchreader.com
5947000	5948000	Fuck that, Rob.
5948000	5951000	I keep my eye touch with me all the damn time and in my pocket at work.
5951000	5954000	Because due to some shit that happened around work last year,
5954000	5956000	I'm paranoid about my eye touch getting jacked.
5956000	5957000	Well, that's unfortunate.
5957000	5960000	F you to those stupid people that caused you to be paranoid.
5960000	5963000	I get some people, yes, they do have their eye touch with them all the time.
5963000	5966000	But I also know some people that, you know, they only have it at home or at work.
5966000	5968000	You know, they don't really carry it with them everywhere.
5968000	5969000	So just...
5969000	5970000	You know what your habits are.
5970000	5974000	If you do have your eye touch with you all the time, then maybe the Blizzard thing is a good idea.
5974000	5976000	SSJ100matt kind of jokes.
5976000	5978000	I don't know if this is a joke or real.
5978000	5981000	But Blizzard banning IPs in Korea is an act of war, Rob.
5981000	5987000	I'm not saying ban Korea or whatever country you want to name from the games.
5987000	5994000	But if you have a game that has US servers that's meant to be played by the US that's localized for the US,
5994000	5996000	Korea gets their own version of the games.
5996000	5998000	WoW's been localized for China.
5998000	5999000	WoW's out another...
5999000	6001000	You know what I mean?
6001000	6009000	Unfortunately, if all the gold farming is coming from China, maybe it's time to put some restrictions down.
6009000	6014000	I think they also need to place some restrictions on, you know, who can do these shouts and chat and so forth.
6014000	6017000	Blizzard's done a really good job over the years, though.
6017000	6018000	I mean, let's face it.
6018000	6022000	Every time they evolve, the gold hackers and the gold farmers have to get a little smarter.
6022000	6026000	I don't want to make it sound like Blizzard's done nothing because they really have done a lot.
6026000	6030000	They've gotten smart about how they do trial accounts and a lot of the various aspects of WoW.
6030000	6036000	It just sucks that they just won't play hardball and start suing the pants off of some of these people that exploit their game.
6036000	6038000	You know what I mean?
6038000	6039000	I just want to see some...
6039000	6044000	I want to see heads roll over my account getting hacked.
6044000	6045000	All right.
6045000	6047000	That's going to do it for the Twitter topics for tonight.
6047000	6051000	Let's talk about some of the year-end news.
6051000	6058000	And we'll start off talking about some of our favorite games of the year and games you might call your game of the year.
6058000	6064000	In chat room, we're taking your submissions as well, and I'll try to keep an eye on the Twitter, too, for those of you that can't be in chat.
6064000	6067000	You know, what were some of your picks for the game of the year and why?
6067000	6073000	Usually, I find these game of the year picks to be a little silly because it's just one person's opinion.
6073000	6077000	So keep that in mind as we talk about our favorite games of the year.
6077000	6078000	We're just gamers.
6078000	6079000	We like what we like.
6079000	6085000	And this is our opinion for the game that you think was the most important game of 2009.
6085000	6086000	I'll start with Loki tonight.
6086000	6087000	What do you think, Loki?
6087000	6088000	What do you think were...
6088000	6090000	And if you have a couple, go ahead.
6090000	6093000	But what do you think overall was probably the biggest game of 2009?
6093000	6094000	Of 2009?
6094000	6097000	Well, probably Call of Duty Tomorrow Warfare 2 was, but I didn't play that game.
6097000	6104000	So the game I liked, or at least just if I was going to vote based on how much I played it, I'd say Grand Theft Auto.
6104000	6108000	Mainly the two expansions because that's what I was ending up playing.
6108000	6116000	And, you know, I think it's kind of neat because, you know, whereas before we wouldn't really see expansions for Grand Theft Auto.
6116000	6121000	We'd just see a couple other games kind of using the same engine, and still we may see that relatively soon.
6121000	6128000	But it was kind of neat to kind of expand upon the story and kind of bring different perspectives to it and whatnot.
6128000	6129000	And it was fun.
6129000	6133000	They kind of brought back some of the old stuff that I thought should have been in there in the first place.
6133000	6137000	A lot of the over-the-top stuff because they want to keep it grounded in reality, whatever.
6137000	6142000	So that was kind of, you know, my favorite of the year.
6142000	6145000	Other important games, I think DJ Hero was pretty big.
6145000	6151000	You know, kind of a different take on the whole music game genre, and I kind of like that.
6151000	6155000	I thought DJ Hero was horrifically underrated, and it's kind of sad.
6155000	6157000	Like, you know, a lot of people were writing it off as a failure.
6157000	6164000	But, you know, in looking at my Twitter and my Facebook, it seems like DJ Hero was a big-time Christmas present that was showing up for a lot of people.
6164000	6170000	So maybe it'll find a second life of sorts as we get in past the holidays.
6170000	6176000	And also some of the other underrated Wii games, you know, more of the mature stuff like Madworld.
6176000	6179000	You know, I love that game. I thought it was pretty fun.
6179000	6184000	And it's just, you know, unfortunately a lot of the mature stuff doesn't do well.
6184000	6186000	Especially when they don't put a lot of press behind it.
6186000	6195000	I mean, there are some commercials and stuff, but I don't think the mature audience is really that big right now on the Wii, which is too bad.
6195000	6199000	Because a lot of people have kind of given up on it and just went elsewhere.
6199000	6201000	So I'd have to, you know, vote that.
6201000	6204000	And really, unfortunately, I didn't play a lot of other stuff.
6204000	6208000	I'm sure Borderlands would be on my list if I had actually played that this year.
6208000	6212000	And there's still time, but, you know, it's unfortunate.
6212000	6215000	But, you know, that was probably a good one.
6215000	6222000	I'm sure a little bit of, I'm sure Infinite would have been on there, because that was supposed to be pretty good.
6222000	6224000	I just didn't get a chance to play it.
6224000	6228000	Prototype was alright, but that was kind of crap.
6228000	6232000	Street Fighter IV was kind of cool.
6232000	6236000	I'm not really huge into the Street Fighter stuff, but that was kind of neat.
6236000	6240000	And, you know, playing Tatsunoko versus Capcom won the import.
6240000	6243000	That was actually pretty sweet, and I'd say that's going to be a good one this year.
6243000	6247000	And of course, you know, just we got to joke and say it.
6247000	6253000	President Cat is very strange and absolutely a weird game to come out.
6253000	6256000	But I think it could do well over here.
6256000	6259000	I mean, seriously, there's so much crap that comes out in the Wii.
6259000	6261000	I don't understand why anybody couldn't take a chance.
6261000	6267000	And, you know, there are companies like this, Graffiti Entertainment, Axis Game Localization.
6267000	6269000	I mean, fuck, they're bringing over Choniki.
6269000	6272000	Come on, man. Take the gamble.
6272000	6275000	Alright, Loki's named about 20 different games for his game of the year.
6275000	6278000	What do you think, DarkSakura? Is your list as long?
6278000	6283000	Probably not, given that, I mean, Sims 3 came out, and that was big for me.
6283000	6287000	Because I actually really enjoy Sims 3.
6287000	6294000	I haven't gotten World Adventures, but that was, you know, especially now they've got the build a world thing for Sims 3.
6294000	6295000	That's actually pretty cool.
6295000	6302000	And the fact that, of course, it didn't take too long for all of the modders to start putting out their own hacks to the game,
6302000	6306000	and their own items and stuff, so it was pretty cool.
6306000	6309000	And of course, I love building houses.
6309000	6316000	Other stuff, yeah, I've really been enjoying Danplay, Borderlands.
6316000	6318000	I can't play it because I get, you know, motion sick.
6318000	6321000	I've got my Silent Hill that I haven't played yet.
6321000	6328000	I'm going to say, though, Street Fighter IV was really big for me, especially getting Sakura in the home release made me happy.
6328000	6331000	Because then I could, you know, kick Dan's butt and be happy about it.
6331000	6336000	Of course, though, we got it, like, right around the time my hand was really in bad shape.
6336000	6342000	And I have to also second Tatsunoko vs Capcom, because, again, big Tatsunoko fan for me.
6342000	6344000	Big Capcom fan.
6344000	6348000	So the two together was just like a squeegasm in the process.
6348000	6359000	And I remember sitting on the couch and being in absolute pain and still insisting on trying to beat the stupid bouncing ball in Tatsunoko vs Capcom.
6359000	6361000	I'm like, look, they're playing the Gachomon music.
6361000	6363000	Look, they're playing the Gachomon music.
6363000	6364000	I'm so happy.
6364000	6368000	You know, big, big, uh, squeegasm for me.
6368000	6370000	Are you looking forward to the localization next year?
6370000	6371000	Are you like, no thanks, Cas.
6371000	6372000	Heck yeah.
6372000	6374000	As long as they leave most of it in Japanese.
6376000	6377000	Alright.
6377000	6378000	I'm sorry, they've got the voice actors.
6378000	6380000	How can you go wrong with that?
6382000	6383000	Um, let's see.
6383000	6389000	I would say there's probably three games I would bestow the Game of the Year honor upon.
6389000	6391000	One of them you'll say, okay, yeah, I see that.
6391000	6393000	Because it's something everybody else named.
6393000	6396000	Uh, one of them you'll say, dammit, Rob, why'd you have to say that?
6396000	6399000	And then the other one you're going to go, LOL, what the fuck?
6399000	6404000	The first one I would say Dark Soccer and Loki also both said Street Fighter IV, I think was one of the best games that came out this year.
6404000	6408000	I think it was an awesome upgrade to Street Fighter II, because we'll just ignore the third one.
6408000	6414000	Uh, but I think, you know, it kind of brought a lot of people back to that series, including myself.
6414000	6417000	And I thought some of the integration they did online was really great.
6417000	6422000	And, uh, you know, it came out kind of early in the year, so I think a lot of people forget it was one of the games this year.
6422000	6425000	But I think it did great, great things for fighting games this year.
6425000	6428000	And, uh, you know, it's just going to continue on to next year when Super Street Fighter IV comes out.
6428000	6433000	Very interesting, it's the one game all three of us named, so maybe you'd want to say that as the collective Game of the Year.
6433000	6434000	I don't know.
6434000	6441000	Um, let's see, also, I would say New Super Mario Bros. Wii is definitely worthy of the praise of Game of the Year.
6441000	6442000	For some of the same reasons.
6442000	6449000	And it pains me when Nintendo does this, because, dammit, I mean, Nintendo...
6449000	6455000	They so rarely are putting out these games that are so appealing to the hardcore, if you will, gamers.
6455000	6461000	But then there's that one diamond in the rough that comes out, and I mean, like, literally sparkling diamond.
6461000	6464000	And New Super Mario Bros. Wii was kind of that game.
6464000	6469000	It had a lot in there for veteran gamers like myself, you know, the nostalgia factor is obviously huge.
6469000	6472000	But that nostalgia factor carries over to the basic gamers.
6472000	6480000	They really did get it right in, you know, a lot of people don't want to touch Mario Galaxy, as great of a game as that is,
6480000	6484000	because it's like, what? 3D Mario? Can't control? Ah, a little weird.
6484000	6487000	But New Super Mario Bros. Wii kind of takes Mario back to its roots.
6487000	6489000	And it's like, oh, jump on Google.
6489000	6491000	That was pretty funny. That was pretty fun.
6491000	6494000	And it's absolute chaos getting a bunch of people together.
6494000	6499000	It is hell in four player mode, but I still kind of applaud Nintendo for making it work, so to speak.
6499000	6503000	So I thought it was an awesome game.
6503000	6507000	It brought a lot of gamers back to gaming.
6507000	6514000	And you know, sometimes you want to hate Nintendo for this, but like I said, it's a diamond in the rough of the Wii software that's out there.
6514000	6518000	Here's my LOL what the fuck pic for game of the year.
6518000	6520000	And I honestly think it's deserving.
6520000	6523000	And a lot of people are forgetting that this game is from this year.
6523000	6528000	But it is absolutely one of the best things to happen to gaming this year.
6528000	6534000	1 versus 100 on Xbox Live, I think, absolutely deserves the accolade of one of the games of the years.
6534000	6537000	It's something new we haven't really seen before-ish.
6537000	6543000	I mean, unless you want to go back to the old days of the Berkley Entertainment on the PC and Acrophobia and all this stuff.
6543000	6546000	You know, we haven't really seen anything quite like it, this whole like game show thing.
6546000	6549000	It's a lot of fun to actually play with friends.
6549000	6553000	It really appeals to a broad base of people.
6553000	6556000	It's kind of neat that you're actually playing for real money.
6556000	6559000	I mean, it's such a different type of game.
6559000	6563000	I give it such props for being new, different, and fun.
6563000	6568000	Best of all, if you happen to be an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, it's free.
6568000	6571000	Or even the silver folks got it free for a little while.
6571000	6574000	So, you know, it's fair to say that this game was free.
6574000	6577000	So, how can you go wrong?
6577000	6581000	I think 1 versus 100 in some ways is the game of the year.
6581000	6586000	And for whoever was asking earlier where our game is going in the future,
6586000	6589000	I'll bet you see some more stuff like this, the interactive stuff.
6589000	6593000	I think it's going to be very cool to see how that plays out in the next decade.
6593000	6595000	So, check that out.
6595000	6597000	So, those were our games of the year.
6597000	6599000	What about you guys in our chat room?
6599000	6604000	Some of you guys were naming some of your things here.
6604000	6606000	GameGuru says, what's wrong with Street Fighter 3?
6606000	6608000	Well, okay, it's pandering to the base.
6608000	6612000	But still, I don't want to buy Street Fighter 4 when Super Street Fighter 4 is coming out.
6612000	6615000	Yeah, that was unfortunate that Super Street Fighter 4 was announced kind of soon
6615000	6618000	because, you know, it devalued the original.
6618000	6620000	But, you know, we had Street Fighter 2 and Super Street Fighter 2,
6620000	6624000	so I guess it's nothing too unheard of there.
6624000	6627000	Let's see.
6627000	6630000	Tigerclaw says, game of the year for me is Batman Arkham Asylum.
6630000	6632000	You know, that did get a lot of props.
6632000	6634000	Very good storytelling in that game.
6634000	6637000	And certainly, panders to fans of Batman like in the comic form.
6637000	6640000	They did a really good job with that game.
6640000	6643000	They really did.
6643000	6648000	You know, I really, really liked Harley in that game.
6648000	6651000	You know, this is actually a game that convinced one of my friends to get an Xbox.
6651000	6653000	It's really good storytelling.
6653000	6654000	It was.
6654000	6657000	Sj100Matt says, from the sports side here, NHL 10.
6657000	6661000	Not only was it great, but it beat out Madden 10 for the best sports game at the VGAs.
6661000	6665000	A hockey game beating out a football game? What?
6665000	6670000	Well, we also got a contribution from Marin, Beatles Rock Band.
6670000	6673000	Which, actually, I'm going to have to go with as well.
6673000	6675000	But, you know, you should say that.
6675000	6676000	Of course.
6676000	6677000	Heart, heart, heart.
6677000	6680000	Beatles Rock Band was an excellent implementation.
6680000	6683000	I'm still opting for DJ Hero as my music game of the year,
6683000	6687000	but I do respect greatly Beatles Rock Band,
6687000	6690000	and I think it was badly needed.
6690000	6692000	I think getting it out was a big achievement.
6692000	6694000	I think so, too.
6694000	6698000	And just to get everybody on stage at E3 to announce it, that was epic.
6698000	6699000	Come on.
6699000	6704000	Having Yoko Ono, George Harrison's wife, McCartney, you know, Ringo Starr,
6704000	6708000	all on stage at once, pretty awesome.
6708000	6711000	Pretty, pretty awesome.
6711000	6713000	Speaking of some of the things that happened this year,
6713000	6715000	just kind of like trekking back,
6715000	6718000	and it's kind of funny to look back sometimes on what happened in previous months,
6718000	6720000	kind of see where that put us this year.
6720000	6722000	Just quickly going through some of the big things that happened this year.
6722000	6725000	If you look at January and some of the things that happened there,
6725000	6728000	a lot of restructuring and layoff news.
6728000	6731000	You know, Sony did some restructuring and announced a 2.9 billion loss.
6731000	6736000	Microsoft at once thought Invisible Company laid off 5,000 people.
6736000	6737000	That both happened in January.
6737000	6740000	Sadly, layoffs were a big thing this year.
6740000	6741000	What do you guys think?
6741000	6744000	Are we past that, or are we going to continue to see more layoffs?
6744000	6747000	What's going to happen to all these people that lost their jobs in 09?
6747000	6750000	It'll slow down, probably, as far as layoffs go,
6750000	6752000	and probably hirings, even.
6752000	6755000	You probably see a lot of these guys that got laid off from these companies
6755000	6757000	forming their own smaller companies.
6757000	6759000	That seems to be the trend.
6759000	6762000	And interesting, because maybe that indie development
6762000	6767000	is going to lead to more digital distribution, as we talked about before.
6767000	6768000	Let's see.
6768000	6771000	Moving on to February, some of the things that happened there,
6771000	6772000	unfortunately, more losses.
6772000	6775000	EA cut back 11% of their workforce.
6775000	6778000	Activision, Blizzard, I don't know how the hell they lost money,
6778000	6779000	but they sure did.
6779000	6783000	And they did not do any huge layoffs, though, at that time.
6783000	6785000	Also, though, what I thought was interesting,
6785000	6790000	Wii Fit sold 777,000 copies in January.
6790000	6793000	That news would then roll over to February.
6793000	6798000	So, you know, Wii Fit was obviously a big piece of gaming in 2009
6798000	6801000	that none of us named in our game of the year.
6801000	6803000	Has Wii Fit been good or bad for gaming?
6803000	6805000	What do you guys think?
6805000	6808000	I wouldn't say in terms of gaming,
6808000	6814000	but it's definitely been good in terms of making exercise enjoyable.
6814000	6817000	Wii Fit is not something that I really consider to be a game.
6817000	6819000	I consider it to be a tool.
6819000	6822000	It's a fun tech demo, is really what it is.
6822000	6826000	And I think a lot of stuff that Nintendo has done
6826000	6828000	could be kind of considered a tech demo.
6828000	6830000	Hell, Wii Sports and Wii Play,
6830000	6832000	a lot of that stuff was just a tech demo for the Wii,
6832000	6835000	and it ended up being pretty successful.
6835000	6840000	I think, if anything, Wii Sports hurt gaming more than Wii Fit did.
6840000	6841000	Wii Fit, eh, who cares?
6841000	6843000	You know, it's an exercise game that comes out.
6843000	6844000	I don't have to play that.
6844000	6846000	Wii Sports, oh, look, it's like a party game.
6846000	6849000	Every fucking game that seems to come out on the Wii nowadays
6849000	6853000	is almost like a party game because Wii's the party console.
6853000	6854000	Yeah, great.
6854000	6856000	You know what, though?
6856000	6858000	I would like some other types of games on there
6858000	6863000	because there's at least one party game coming out every freaking week.
6863000	6866000	Enough is enough.
6866000	6869000	You want to see a party-free 2010?
6869000	6872000	I would like to see them actually go back to what worked before.
6872000	6874000	You don't necessarily need to change.
6874000	6876000	Make some good side-scrolling games.
6876000	6880000	Make some good, you know, just games that utilize the technology.
6880000	6882000	Everything doesn't have to be a party game.
6882000	6884000	Everything doesn't have to be a waggle fest.
6884000	6887000	Just do it what worked.
6887000	6888000	I mean, I don't understand it.
6888000	6891000	We had a lot of games selling back in the day
6891000	6896000	of the Super Nintendo and stuff, and even the NES and whatnot,
6896000	6899000	and they didn't really rely on a lot of gimmicks.
6899000	6903000	Made mode 7, but I mean, come on, it wasn't that bad.
6903000	6906000	Moving into March, some of the big news from March
6906000	6908000	was Game Developers Conference happened in March,
6908000	6910000	and some of the big things that came out of Game Developers Conference
6910000	6913000	was the DS Zelda game that we ended up getting a little later in the year.
6913000	6918000	Also, OnLive and their on-demand game streaming.
6918000	6920000	Do you remember hearing about this, OnLive?
6920000	6922000	Do you think OnLive is something to take seriously,
6922000	6926000	this whole on-demand game streaming in the future?
6926000	6930000	It was supposed to be top-tier games from EA, Take-Two, Ubisoft.
6930000	6934000	They will be on your PC and soon TVs later in the year,
6934000	6936000	although of course that never happened.
6936000	6941000	What do you think about OnLive in the future of that?
6941000	6944000	I think that if it works like they say it is, then it's a good thing.
6944000	6947000	I mean, it'll be pretty popular because everybody's really digging
6947000	6950000	into streaming stuff nowadays, especially with Netflix
6950000	6953000	and other video services out there.
6953000	6957000	Steam as a digital distribution platform has done pretty well,
6957000	6961000	so combining the two is not a bad thing.
6961000	6966000	I think, though, reality is going to be slightly different than what's promised.
6966000	6971000	I mean, it seems very hard to fathom that something like that is going to work.
6971000	6976000	But hey, if it does, whatever the technology may be, then more power to them.
6976000	6978000	And I'm sure if it works out for them,
6978000	6983000	then the big three will probably try to find a way to do it themselves.
6983000	6985000	Some of the news as we moved into April.
6985000	6987000	Will Wright left EA.
6987000	6990000	I kind of forgot that that happened,
6990000	6993000	but that's when an epic designer leaves a big company like that.
6993000	6995000	You always kind of wonder what the heck is going on there.
6995000	6998000	Also, the disappointing sales of Chinatown Wars.
6998000	7001000	Remember how in 2008, Nintendo got up there at E3 and said,
7001000	7004000	hey, we've got a Grand Theft Auto game coming to the DS.
7004000	7009000	It's going to be awesome, and it's going to try to get some of those hardcore players on our unit.
7009000	7013000	It sold under 90,000 units in March, which is considered a disappointment.
7013000	7016000	What happened with Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars?
7016000	7018000	I didn't really care for it that much,
7018000	7021000	and it's mainly because it's kind of going back to the old school game.
7021000	7026000	I think we remember back in the day the old school one was pretty fun.
7026000	7030000	But now that we have the newer ones, it's like,
7030000	7035000	well, it's cool and all, but I would have rather had something more like the PSP.
7035000	7039000	And there seems to be like, oh, well, you can't do that on the Nintendo system.
7039000	7041000	It's just not powerful enough.
7041000	7043000	But then we have Cop the Recruit that comes out.
7043000	7046000	It looks just like the old PSP Grand Theft Auto games.
7046000	7050000	And we have to go back to Rockstar and go, what the fuck?
7050000	7052000	So you can do it, but you just didn't.
7052000	7054000	You didn't really put the effort into it.
7054000	7058000	Instead, you made these little mini games that involved the DS stylus.
7058000	7064000	I guess that's neat and all, but it just really didn't hook me in like the other ones.
7064000	7069000	I guess my standards have gone up since one and two.
7069000	7072000	Well, not a lot happened in May, but then we got into June,
7072000	7075000	and June was, of course, the big E3 expo.
7075000	7078000	And at E3 was when we got a hell of a lot of news,
7078000	7082000	including the unveiling of Project Natal from Microsoft,
7082000	7084000	Sony showing their ice cream cone controller,
7084000	7087000	whatever that thing is supposed to be for their motion sensing,
7087000	7090000	and then Nintendo showing the Wii Vitality sensor.
7090000	7095000	Looking back on E3 this year, any kind of thoughts about how the show went
7095000	7098000	or kind of where we are now six months later?
7098000	7102000	I think everyone was still pooping themselves over Natal.
7102000	7106000	I think that Nintendo disappointed once again, you know,
7106000	7110000	not as bad as the year prior, but this year was kind of pathetic.
7110000	7114000	And I'm sorry, the Wii Vitality sensor.
7114000	7117000	Okay, remember with the Wii Fit Balance Board, it's like,
7117000	7120000	oh, it's going to revolutionize how you do these exercise games and stuff.
7120000	7122000	And great, now we have a bunch of these games
7122000	7125000	that have the Balance Board sensors in there,
7125000	7128000	and we use it, and okay, that's great.
7128000	7134000	Not a real huge step, I guess, but it's neat nonetheless.
7134000	7138000	The Vitality sensor, I'm sorry, I don't see what the point is of this.
7138000	7141000	I just don't get it, and I know they're going to have that stupid game,
7141000	7143000	Wii Relax, come out.
7143000	7147000	Great, you'll sell some copies of that, but I think it's crap.
7147000	7150000	What happened to that Metroid game that Teen Ninja was doing?
7150000	7152000	I mean, we saw a neat little preview of E3,
7152000	7154000	and it's literally not a damn thing since then.
7154000	7158000	Yeah, it's promises of stuff that will come later on, like next year.
7158000	7161000	I'll be surprised if that game comes out this year.
7161000	7162000	I will be surprised.
7162000	7163000	2010, you mean?
7163000	7165000	Yeah, 2010.
7165000	7167000	I'll be surprised if it makes it out in 2010,
7167000	7172000	but I don't know, it's just excuses and delays.
7172000	7174000	A lot of the stuff, and they keep trying,
7174000	7177000	it's almost like they're trying to grasp at, you know,
7177000	7180000	they have like this really boring presentation,
7180000	7183000	and they're trying to grasp at like the hardcore players are going like,
7183000	7184000	fuck this, I'm out of here, you know.
7184000	7186000	I'm done with this new presentation.
7186000	7189000	We got the games that you want.
7189000	7190000	They're coming.
7190000	7192000	Don't worry, just be patient.
7192000	7195000	I got to play devil's advocate here, though, because of what I just said.
7195000	7197000	One of the other things Nintendo revealed at E3 this year,
7197000	7201000	which was not expected by any means, was New Super Mario Brothers Wii,
7201000	7204000	which, I'm sorry, is one of the best games that came out this year.
7204000	7205000	It really was.
7205000	7208000	Yeah, that's pretty sad that that's the best game that came out this year
7208000	7212000	from Nintendo, a company that, you know, had really innovative games in the past.
7212000	7214000	All have been, you know, really great titles,
7214000	7217000	except recently some of their games that they released are kind of,
7217000	7220000	eh, you know, whatever, I don't really care.
7220000	7222000	I mean, seriously, what did they release this year?
7222000	7224000	Let me think here.
7224000	7229000	So we had Wii Fit Plus, which was basically just a port of Wii Fit,
7229000	7231000	now with some added crap on there,
7231000	7235000	and we're going to throw it in for a discount just to capitalize on Wii Fit again,
7235000	7237000	because people may have forgotten about it.
7237000	7239000	We had Wii Sports Resort, which comes with an extra sensor
7239000	7242000	that really should have been in the Wii Remote to begin with,
7242000	7245000	and kind of what they really promised with the Wii from the get-go,
7245000	7247000	but, oh, we just couldn't do it.
7247000	7248000	Right.
7248000	7251000	You just couldn't add that extra sensor in there because it would be too expensive,
7251000	7254000	or you just want to sell some more peripherals later on.
7254000	7255000	Okay, great.
7255000	7258000	So you repackaged Wii Sports, and we threw it back out there again.
7258000	7264000	Okay, then you have, you know, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which is fine.
7264000	7267000	It's your traditional Mario Bros. game, which is really what a lot of people look for,
7267000	7270000	because, you know, God forbid...
7270000	7271000	And it was great!
7271000	7273000	It was a great game that came out this year.
7273000	7276000	Yeah, that, okay, and then Metroid Prime Trilogy,
7276000	7278000	which was just a rehash of some old stuff.
7278000	7281000	Then they added the new Play Control series,
7281000	7286000	which is basically ported GameCube games that they've added some Wii controls to.
7286000	7291000	Great! I'm glad you have the ability to port GameCube games and add Waggle to them.
7291000	7295000	Way to be innovative.
7295000	7299000	I'm sorry, it's just, you know, in looking at the first quarter slate for Nintendo,
7299000	7304000	let's see, we have a remake of a couple Pokemon games.
7304000	7308000	We have another Endless Ocean game, which, you know, the first one was kind of neat,
7308000	7311000	but I don't think it really warranted a sequel.
7311000	7315000	And then we have, let's see here, another cooking sim,
7315000	7321000	which, to be honest, is exactly the same as the last cooking game that they had for Nintendo.
7321000	7324000	I kid you not, the descriptions are almost identical,
7324000	7326000	except they changed the name of the game,
7326000	7330000	you know, because some people might, you know, get fooled by that.
7330000	7335000	And what do they have other than, you know, the Zelda game for the DS, which was kind of cool.
7335000	7339000	Let's see, they had some style simulation games,
7339000	7342000	because God forbid there's not enough of those on the DS,
7342000	7345000	you know, between Ubisoft and Dreamcatcher,
7345000	7348000	there's so many damn games for girls.
7348000	7350000	I mean, it just got lost in the fray right there.
7350000	7352000	And a lot of things that they release,
7352000	7356000	I think Nintendo thinks that their name's going to sell these titles.
7356000	7357000	Well, that's not been the case.
7357000	7359000	Fossil Fighters? Hello.
7359000	7364000	There's been other games that have been put out exactly the same as that.
7364000	7365000	It's just they just don't get it,
7365000	7367000	and I'm sure they're going to promise some more stuff,
7367000	7369000	maybe Pikmin 3, and then everyone will shit their pants,
7369000	7371000	because it's Pikmin 3, and it's going to come out.
7371000	7373000	It's going to be exactly the same as Pikmin 2,
7373000	7375000	which just was some extra shit,
7375000	7380000	and people are going to buy into it because they're fucking cheap.
7380000	7382000	Well, we know Galaxy 2 is on the way, too.
7382000	7384000	And I'm glad that New Super Mario Brothers,
7384000	7385000	a completely original game,
7385000	7390000	God forbid that it was like another New Super Mario Brothers game that came out on,
7390000	7391000	oh, the DS. Oh, that's right.
7391000	7394000	Very similar to that, except now we have four players,
7394000	7395000	because it's a party game.
7395000	7398000	Oh, party, because that's so awesome.
7398000	7402000	You can play a single-player mode, and it's still a rewarding experience, I think.
7402000	7405000	And there are new power-ups and new things they do in it.
7405000	7406000	Oh, new power-ups.
7406000	7410000	That's totally new for a Mario game, you bastard.
7410000	7411000	New power-ups.
7411000	7412000	Oh, my God.
7412000	7415000	Oh, I take everything back that I said about Nintendo.
7415000	7420000	Well, if they have new power-ups in there, then God forbid, Game of the Year.
7420000	7422000	And Super Mario Galaxy 2,
7422000	7425000	yeah, I'm sure that'll be very different than Galaxy 1.
7425000	7427000	Oh, we added some different levels now.
7427000	7428000	Praise us.
7428000	7430000	All the work's been done on the engine before,
7430000	7432000	but now we have new levels and new gimmicks,
7432000	7436000	and you're going to think, oh, my God, it's so awesome.
7436000	7439000	And yell in that same little girly voice.
7439000	7441000	Maybe we'll get Twilight Princess 2.
7441000	7443000	It'll be exactly the same as Twilight Princess 1,
7443000	7444000	but it'll have some slightly new levels in it.
7444000	7445000	You know there's going to be the Zelda...
7445000	7447000	Maybe they'll fuse them and do Majora's Princess.
7447000	7449000	You know there's going to be the Zelda game.
7449000	7451000	That's going to be the big thing they're going to unveil at E3 this year.
7451000	7453000	Mark my words, 2010 predictions.
7453000	7455000	New Zelda will be the thing.
7455000	7457000	Nintendo tries to redeem themselves with this year.
7457000	7459000	You know what's great about Nintendo, though?
7459000	7462000	Their fans are so dumb and so forgiving of everything that they do,
7462000	7464000	they'll sell a million copies no matter what they do.
7464000	7466000	They could shit in a box and call it Metroid
7466000	7469000	and give it to you and you'd buy it because you're fucking stupid.
7469000	7471000	Way to go, folks.
7471000	7474000	You know, anything that you want them to do correctly,
7474000	7476000	they're never going to do anymore because, you know what,
7476000	7477000	you'll buy their shit.
7477000	7479000	I'm sorry, I still stand by it.
7479000	7481000	As much as you're calling it recycled garbage and all this stuff,
7481000	7483000	if it's still a good game,
7483000	7487000	I think Mario Galaxy 2 has the potential to be really awesome
7487000	7490000	because Galaxy 1 was great
7490000	7493000	and if they just improve on that, it's going to get even better.
7493000	7497000	I mean, you can't say that they don't have sequels and rehash shit
7497000	7499000	on the 360 and the PS3 as well.
7499000	7502000	Oh, they do. I call them out for it.
7502000	7506000	We have a game that comes out every year that's a rehash of the last year's game.
7506000	7508000	We call it Madden.
7508000	7510000	And NBA Live.
7510000	7512000	And NBA 2K.
7512000	7514000	And Dance Dance Revolution.
7514000	7516000	And Dance Dance Revolution.
7516000	7519000	And God forbid, you know, Call of Duty.
7519000	7523000	There's a lot of companies that are guilty of that,
7523000	7527000	but the fact that Nintendo has the balls to go,
7527000	7530000	hey, look, we're taking these GameCube games
7530000	7531000	and we're putting them on the Wii.
7531000	7534000	They're new because they're now on the Wii.
7534000	7537000	We didn't really do anything to them other than change the controls.
7537000	7541000	If that's the case, where the fuck is my F-Zero?
7541000	7545000	That is the one GameCube game I have yet to see come over to the Wii.
7545000	7548000	And might I point out, not only is it just a GameCube game,
7548000	7552000	it was the best fucking GameCube game that ever came out.
7552000	7556000	Well, I'm sorry, they have to do Donkey Kong's Jungle Beat first
7556000	7558000	because apparently people like that game.
7558000	7561000	It didn't sell very well with the bongos, but hey, you know.
7561000	7564000	And you know what, we can also do a Donkey Kong racing game
7564000	7566000	that used to be with the bongos,
7566000	7569000	but no, now we're just going to add some sort of wacky controls.
7569000	7571000	Three words. Three words.
7571000	7574000	Fuck Donkey Kong.
7574000	7577000	Donkey Kong is best left to the memory of the Super Nintendo
7577000	7581000	awesomely 3D rendered games Donkey Kong countries that were there.
7581000	7584000	I'm over it. Let's move on.
7584000	7588000	Where's my F-Zero game that I can play online?
7588000	7592000	Dude, where's my good updated Star Fox?
7592000	7596000	And they always manage to take their sequels and fuck them over in some way.
7596000	7601000	Perfect example, Excite Truck, the best racing game on the Wii.
7601000	7605000	Sequel set to come out, Excite Bots Trick Racing.
7605000	7606000	What the fuck did you do there?
7606000	7610000	Oh, people like Transformers.
7610000	7613000	What the fuck does throwing a pie at a clown have anything to do with racing?
7613000	7616000	It doesn't have anything to do with racing.
7616000	7619000	And God forbid they just shit on that sequel.
7619000	7622000	But I was an idiot and bought it because, you know,
7622000	7624000	I had hope that it was going to be as good as the original,
7624000	7627000	but no, it wasn't.
7627000	7629000	Fool me once.
7629000	7632000	You will not fool me twice.
7632000	7635000	I see some chat, and the chat's kind of flying right now.
7635000	7637000	I can't really keep up with it, but I do see Game Guru
7637000	7639000	saying something about the God of War collection.
7639000	7641000	It's God of War 1 and 2 in HD.
7641000	7643000	Rar. I mean, does that fall into-
7643000	7645000	At least it's in HD.
7645000	7648000	If they improve the graphics on the Wii games on those new play control games,
7648000	7650000	hey, that's different, okay?
7650000	7651000	Because that's, you know-
7651000	7653000	Well, would they have widescreen now?
7653000	7655000	Oh.
7655000	7658000	Well, I take it all back.
7658000	7662000	But might I point out, F-Zero, again,
7662000	7665000	which I worship that game's cock because it's amazing,
7665000	7668000	F-Zero on the GameCube had widescreen support.
7668000	7670000	It had, if I remember right, progressive scan support
7670000	7672000	and all that fancy stuff on the GameCube.
7672000	7674000	Same with God of War 2.
7674000	7681000	That also had 720p support through a code.
7681000	7684000	Can we move on past the Nintendo hatred?
7684000	7685000	Yes, we can.
7685000	7686000	And the thousands of subscribers.
7686000	7689000	We just lost all the Nintendo fanboys,
7689000	7690000	crying in the corner.
7690000	7692000	I still stand by, you know what, again,
7692000	7695000	the thing that pisses me off about Nintendo
7695000	7698000	is that it's not that I don't disagree with Loki.
7698000	7701000	Most of what he's saying I pretend to agree with,
7701000	7704000	but then they release that one fucking game
7704000	7707000	that's so fucking great, I have to have it,
7707000	7709000	and it justifies the purchase of a Wii.
7709000	7713000	And you have all this shit out there flooding the market
7713000	7715000	in that one game on the goddamn Wii
7715000	7718000	that you just aren't going to get anywhere else,
7718000	7721000	like New Super Mario Brothers Wii.
7721000	7726000	Just like Mario Kart, Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64,
7726000	7730000	the best fucking deathmatch battle mode ever
7730000	7732000	was in those games.
7732000	7734000	And then the GameCube and the Wii version,
7734000	7739000	they just like, eh, let's just fucking ruin it.
7739000	7742000	We don't know what plays that.
7742000	7743000	Who cares?
7743000	7745000	We'll just fuck it over, because no one.
7745000	7748000	You think that's how the boardroom meetings go?
7748000	7751000	Let's fuck this game up just for fun today.
7751000	7752000	We're in a recession.
7752000	7753000	Let's have fun with it.
7753000	7756000	All they had to do was leave it exactly the same
7756000	7757000	and just make new levels.
7757000	7758000	That's it.
7758000	7759000	No improvement needed.
7759000	7761000	It was perfect the way it was.
7761000	7764000	But somehow they just go, eh, no!
7764000	7766000	Throwing it together!
7766000	7768000	And they just ruined the whole thing
7768000	7770000	because they wanted to improve upon it.
7770000	7772000	Way to go!
7772000	7774000	Have you ever heard the phrase, you know,
7774000	7778000	if it ain't broke, don't fix it?
7778000	7779000	All right, let's move on.
7779000	7780000	Yes, please.
7780000	7781000	All right.
7781000	7782000	How about July?
7782000	7783000	Hey, July.
7783000	7786000	Some publishers went kaput in July.
7786000	7789000	Eidos got retired, because obviously it folded
7789000	7790000	into Square Enix,
7790000	7793000	and so they don't really use the Eidos label anymore.
7793000	7794000	And Midway closed.
7794000	7796000	Remember all this stuff that was going on with Midway
7796000	7799000	and bankruptcy and LOL liquidation
7799000	7801000	and all this stuff that was going on with Midway
7801000	7803000	and all their assets?
7803000	7805000	What happened to Midway?
7805000	7807000	Loki, what happened?
7807000	7809000	Maybe I should go to dark soccer for a little while.
7809000	7810000	I need a little less angst over here.
7810000	7812000	What happened to Midway?
7812000	7815000	It's just decision after decision, I think.
7815000	7819000	It was inevitable, especially given how many...
7819000	7822000	You want to go ahead and open the door?
7822000	7826000	I think that it was just given... what?
7826000	7827000	No, I just would get some cool air in here.
7827000	7829000	It's getting stuffy, that's all.
7829000	7830000	Rob, it's just me.
7830000	7831000	Well, Loki's ranting.
7831000	7833000	Just got the temperature up in here about 10 degrees,
7833000	7835000	so I needed it to cool off a little bit.
7835000	7837000	Sorry, dark soccer.
7837000	7841000	I think that it was just...
7841000	7842000	It was bound to happen.
7842000	7844000	You know, they've been losing money.
7844000	7848000	And, you know, especially given,
7848000	7851000	weren't they still the ones who solely owned
7851000	7854000	the Mortal Kombat franchise for a while?
7854000	7857000	Those games certainly weren't doing much of anything.
7857000	7858000	Yeah, sadly.
7858000	7860000	I mean, they had the DC Universe game, but it was...
7860000	7861000	That was crap.
7861000	7863000	Yeah.
7863000	7865000	I think it was just inevitable.
7865000	7868000	Because apparently Blitz League did not pay the bills.
7868000	7870000	And then their next genius idea,
7870000	7872000	which thankfully never came out,
7872000	7874000	This is Vegas.
7874000	7877000	Yes, the game that simulates going to Vegas.
7877000	7883000	Partying, driving cars, having sex with women, and gambling.
7883000	7886000	What?
7886000	7889000	Let's see, some of the news that came out of August.
7889000	7893000	Apparently Wii Sports Resort was the best-selling game of August.
7893000	7894000	There you go, Loki.
7894000	7896000	I thought I'd mention that just for you.
7896000	7898000	And the PlayStation 3 Slim was unveiled.
7898000	7901000	So let's get away from Nintendo for a minute here
7901000	7903000	and talk about maybe the PlayStation 3,
7903000	7905000	because I think this was probably the smartest thing Sony did all year.
7905000	7907000	It was something they should have done a year ago,
7907000	7910000	was drop the price down to $299.
7910000	7912000	Yes, they were retarded from the get-go,
7912000	7915000	saying, oh yeah, our system's going to be $599.
7915000	7916000	What?
7916000	7917000	Don't you remember that YouTube?
7917000	7919000	Because I know we played it on this show like a million times.
7919000	7922000	It was the press conference in under a minute that would go,
7922000	7926000	$599 US dollars, $599 US dollars.
7926000	7928000	And just like over and over again.
7928000	7930000	Because that really was the moment.
7930000	7932000	Everybody was so jazzed about the PlayStation 3,
7932000	7934000	and then they're like, it's going to be $599.
7934000	7939000	And everybody's like, I remember us watching that on TV.
7939000	7942000	We're like, are you fucking kidding me?
7942000	7944000	Or Africa.
7944000	7946000	Which finally came out this year, didn't it?
7946000	7950000	And it sucked.
7950000	7952000	Well, I'm trying to find that real quick,
7952000	7954000	since we are talking about the decade here.
7954000	7956000	Oh yes, here's one of the highlights of the decade,
7956000	7959000	the 2006 Sony press conference.
7959000	7960000	I love this clip.
7960000	7962000	It's one of my favorite YouTubes of the year.
7962000	7965000	So let's just take a look back at how we got to the slim
7965000	7967000	finally this year at $299.
7967000	7970000	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai.
7970000	7973000	Ridge Racer.
7973000	7976000	The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change,
7976000	7979000	and the consumers are ready.
7979000	7984000	Genji 2 is an Ashen game, which is based on Japanese history.
7984000	7986000	Ridge Racer.
7986000	7990000	Being based on history, the stages of the game
7990000	7993000	can also be based on famous battles,
7993000	7996000	which actually took place in ancient Japan.
7996000	7999000	So here's this giant enemy crab.
7999000	8001000	Ridge Racer.
8001000	8005000	And you attack its weak point for massive damage.
8005000	8007000	It's Ridge Racer.
8007000	8009000	Ridge Racer.
8009000	8013000	PlayStation 3 will retail for $599.
8013000	8015000	$599.
8015000	8017000	$599.
8017000	8019000	Giant enemy crab.
8019000	8020000	$599.
8020000	8021000	$599.
8021000	8023000	$599 US dollars.
8023000	8025000	It's Ridge Racer.
8025000	8027000	Ridge Racer.
8027000	8029000	That is the best thing to come out of the decade,
8029000	8032000	by the way, in gaming, was that little one-minute clip
8032000	8034000	from YouTube user macaw45.
8034000	8039000	Congratulations.
8039000	8040000	Why didn't they do it sooner, Loki?
8040000	8042000	Why didn't Sony figure out,
8042000	8045000	maybe we should have dropped the price a long time ago.
8045000	8048000	Were they just stubborn with the whole Blu-ray thing?
8048000	8050000	If they would have dropped the price sooner,
8050000	8051000	they would have sold more units,
8051000	8053000	but they would have also lost their ass
8053000	8055000	from the cost of the system.
8055000	8057000	And the problem was just building a system
8057000	8061000	with that much in components in the first place,
8061000	8064000	it's tough to justify.
8064000	8066000	So they ended up having to cut some corners and stuff,
8066000	8068000	and once the prices of the components came down,
8068000	8072000	they could actually justify dropping the price of the system.
8072000	8075000	It was a little late, so they have some catching up to do,
8075000	8077000	but we'll see.
8077000	8079000	September, some other companies followed along
8079000	8080000	with some price drops.
8080000	8082000	The Wii dropped to $200.
8082000	8084000	That happened in September.
8084000	8087000	And some of the information came out about the PSP Go
8087000	8090000	that there would be no conversion that happens.
8090000	8093000	Like if you own a UMD and you want to upgrade to the PSP Go,
8093000	8099000	you can rebuy your game because of licensing issues.
8099000	8101000	Licensing issues.
8101000	8104000	But wait, the PSP Go wasn't confirmed yet, was it?
8104000	8106000	I think by September it was.
8106000	8108000	They showed it at E3, dummy.
8108000	8110000	No, it wasn't at E3.
8110000	8112000	Yes it was, it was in that back room, wasn't it?
8112000	8114000	You were wrong.
8114000	8115000	I could have sworn it was there.
8115000	8116000	PSP Go was not at E3.
8116000	8118000	PSP Go was shown at Gamescom.
8118000	8120000	Fine.
8120000	8126000	So by September, Gamescom happened anyway.
8126000	8129000	Let's see, and then moving on into more recent things
8129000	8133000	that happened to sum up 2009.
8133000	8137000	Well, when the PSP Go finally did launch in October,
8137000	8142000	that added 100 PSP games to the PlayStation Network.
8142000	8144000	And that was really some of the biggest stuff that came out.
8144000	8149000	Otherwise, some of the stuff about Modern Warfare 2
8149000	8151000	was coming out pretty soon.
8151000	8153000	And some news about the DSi XL,
8153000	8155000	although that hasn't come out yet.
8155000	8158000	The early news of that came out in October.
8158000	8160000	DSi XL.
8160000	8162000	What do you think?
8162000	8165000	It's just, it's unnecessary.
8165000	8170000	I'm really at the point of all of this that I'm like,
8170000	8173000	whatever, people are gonna buy it, whatever,
8173000	8174000	I'm not getting one.
8174000	8176000	Not yet anyway.
8176000	8178000	It's unnecessary, it really is.
8178000	8179000	Let's keep shrinking down the system.
8179000	8181000	Oh wait, let's make it bigger.
8181000	8184000	Okay, put the Game Boy Advance slot back in it then,
8184000	8185000	if you're gonna make it bigger.
8185000	8187000	Oh no, we can't do that.
8187000	8188000	Alright.
8188000	8190000	What's the point of making the screens bigger?
8190000	8191000	For old people.
8191000	8193000	Because bigger's better.
8193000	8194000	Yeah, it's for old people.
8194000	8196000	But remember, remember with the Game Boy Advance,
8196000	8198000	smaller was better, hence the micro.
8198000	8200000	And then that didn't sell very well,
8200000	8202000	so they must have said, oh, never mind, bigger's better.
8202000	8203000	Right?
8203000	8205000	And it's a spectator system now, remember?
8205000	8212000	Because people want to watch you play DSi games.
8212000	8215000	Then I suggest you put a video out on the system.
8215000	8217000	There's a thought.
8217000	8219000	Play it on your TV.
8219000	8221000	And yes, I understand that wouldn't really make sense,
8221000	8225000	you know, playing a DSi on a TV since it's dual screen,
8225000	8229000	but hey, you could maybe split the video signal or something,
8229000	8234000	or you could just put the top screen on there.
8234000	8236000	Bottom screen, whatever.
8236000	8238000	Just jamming through the last couple months here,
8238000	8239000	because they did just happen.
8239000	8241000	In November, of course, EA cut 1,500 jobs.
8241000	8243000	That was 17% of their games.
8243000	8245000	Canceled a dozen games.
8245000	8247000	Not good year for EA in that department,
8247000	8250000	because that was the second big layoff story we got out of EA in the year.
8250000	8252000	And that was also the month where we had a funny story
8252000	8254000	about how World of Warcraft was closed in China for three months,
8254000	8256000	and we kind of joked about what would happen
8256000	8258000	if you couldn't log into World of Warcraft for three months.
8258000	8261000	There would be some people that just wouldn't know what to do with themselves.
8261000	8263000	People would go outdoors.
8263000	8264000	I know it would be.
8264000	8266000	And then they would take all my oxygen.
8266000	8267000	What can we do about that?
8267000	8270000	And then one of my favorite rumors that came out in December
8270000	8275000	that Logitech apparently is making a UMD add-on for the PSP Go.
8275000	8278000	I mean, how ridiculous is that idea?
8278000	8280000	A, why would it be coming from Logitech,
8280000	8282000	unless I guess they're doing it on behalf of Sony or whatever,
8282000	8284000	but still, just what?
8284000	8285000	It's dumb.
8285000	8287000	Isn't that the point?
8287000	8290000	First off, why would you buy that?
8290000	8294000	I don't understand why you would even pay the money to buy a UMD add-on
8294000	8299000	for a system that was more expensive than the PSP 3000 in the first place.
8299000	8303000	And the PSP 3000 has everything that the Go has,
8303000	8306000	with the exception of the Bluetooth, which is fine.
8306000	8311000	But I also don't understand why you would do that.
8311000	8313000	You'd have to be pretty dumb.
8313000	8317000	Just pull the PSP Go off shelves already and cut your losses
8317000	8319000	and make a PSP 2 or something.
8319000	8320000	I don't know.
8320000	8321000	All right.
8321000	8323000	That does it for kind of our year, a little wrap-up there,
8323000	8325000	kind of walking down memory lane and some of the stories there.
8325000	8327000	We're going to get to the decade in a little bit.
8327000	8330000	I'm going to kind of just open up the Skype line
8330000	8332000	to kind of talk about the decade.
8332000	8333000	We'll get to that in a minute,
8333000	8335000	but of course we do have some segments we like to do here every week
8335000	8336000	on Orange Lounge Radio.
8336000	8338000	And one of them is very important.
8338000	8340000	It's our moments of angst,
8340000	8343000	because there were a lot of stupid people this year
8343000	8346000	and stupid people that robbed things,
8346000	8349000	like that guy who stole the Xbox and then played it
8349000	8351000	so they were able to find who they were.
8351000	8353000	Just a lot of stupidity out there.
8353000	8356000	He who shall not be named, the lawyer that was disbarred,
8356000	8361000	one of my personal highlights of the year 2000 to 2010 and so forth.
8361000	8363000	Anyhow, we're going to call this our FUs of the Week.
8363000	8366000	But in some regards, maybe this is the FUs of the Decade.
8366000	8367000	I don't know.
8367000	8368000	Here they are, the FUs of the Week.
8383000	8385000	I actually do have an FU of the Week,
8385000	8391000	which just goes to the TSA for putting in stricter ticket rules, I guess,
8391000	8394000	where your name has to fully match.
8394000	8398000	And my credit card information, when I buy my ticket,
8398000	8401000	it's going to come up under my name as I have it listed for my billing information,
8401000	8404000	which is not exactly how my name shows on my license.
8404000	8405000	So yeah, annoying.
8405000	8407000	But that's about it.
8407000	8411000	And then as far as the year or the decade, I should say,
8411000	8417000	the biggest FU has actually already happened, Rob.
8417000	8419000	What's got disbarred?
8419000	8425000	If that's not a ginormous FU, I don't know what is.
8425000	8426000	All right, fair enough.
8426000	8429000	Loki, what are your FUs of the Week and the Decade?
8429000	8432000	I don't really know.
8432000	8440000	I guess FU2, I don't really have anything.
8440000	8446000	I guess FU2, myself, for not being able to play a lot of games during the holiday break,
8446000	8450000	I think a lot of time I wasted trying to get games for my main cabinet,
8450000	8453000	which I should just really play on the main cabinet,
8453000	8456000	because I have, what, thousands of games on there already,
8456000	8458000	and I haven't touched most of them.
8458000	8460000	So why do I need more games?
8460000	8462000	I know, because I need more of everything.
8462000	8465000	That's why.
8465000	8470000	And then the FU of the Decade goes to...
8470000	8472000	God, I don't even know.
8472000	8474000	That's tough to just nail down one thing.
8474000	8478000	I guess...
8478000	8482000	To Nintendo for disappointing us on a consistent basis.
8482000	8486000	Hey, God damn it, embrace online!
8486000	8490000	My FU of the Week, I don't know, I'm not super angsty.
8490000	8496000	My FU of the Week goes to selfishness,
8496000	8500000	because I think there's some selfish people out there I'm learning about,
8500000	8502000	and I don't like it.
8502000	8508000	My FU of the Decade goes to people that steal things that aren't theirs.
8508000	8512000	You might remember this decade, my car was broken into a multitude of times.
8512000	8517000	We had these people talking about stealing Xboxes and so forth
8517000	8521000	that stupidly sign on to them online, stealing passwords
8521000	8523000	and using them to hack people's accounts.
8523000	8528000	FU to people that don't have the common decency to not touch shit that isn't theirs.
8528000	8532000	Oh, and FU to Proposition 8, that was pretty fucked up too.
8532000	8534000	Hey, back to the show.
8534000	8537000	How about the segment of the show where we open up ye old mailbag
8537000	8539000	and see what our listeners have to say?
8539000	8551000	That would be at our mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com address.
8551000	8553000	We have two emails.
8553000	8554000	Alrighty.
8554000	8557000	First one, hey, OLR, I was in Spanish class a few days ago
8557000	8559000	and thinking about the new year.
8559000	8561000	We should have been focusing on Spanish.
8561000	8564000	Then I started thinking about really crappy games with peripherals
8564000	8567000	that no one will buy like Band Hero and Tony Hawk Ride.
8567000	8571000	So my question to you is what are your peripheral predictions for the new year?
8571000	8573000	Personally, mine will be a knife and fork and stuff like that
8573000	8576000	for a new Cooking Mama game.
8576000	8579000	They've already done that actually.
8579000	8582000	Well, you know, there's actually a burger flipping ticket game
8582000	8584000	that came out in Japan.
8584000	8587000	I think that we're going to get Boonga Boonga for the home
8587000	8590000	and it comes with a real finger to butt peripheral.
8590000	8593000	Whatever happened to the table flipping game that was out in Japan?
8593000	8594000	I'd like to see that out of here.
8594000	8595000	It's out in Japan. That's about it.
8595000	8596000	What about here?
8596000	8604000	I wonder if Boonga Boonga is actually emulated in MAME yet.
8604000	8606000	Go get it. Go get it, Loki.
8606000	8612000	Because if it is, that would be one hell of a fun game to make a peripheral for.
8612000	8614000	Dot, dot, dot.
8614000	8618000	As far as the rest of the email, what I think next year as far as peripherals go,
8618000	8620000	you already know it's the motion sensing stuff.
8620000	8623000	Natal and the ice cream cones from Sony.
8623000	8625000	Those are going to be the huge things, game changers, that come out next year.
8625000	8629000	They're also going to come out with the, I think,
8629000	8632000	not just necessarily something that reads your motion,
8632000	8636000	but also, you know, I would actually like to see something
8636000	8643000	that doesn't necessarily view your motion as much as
8643000	8646000	checks your coordination, you know what I mean?
8646000	8650000	Like it gives you something like a full motion sensing DDR
8650000	8655000	where it gives you your commands and then you have to mimic exactly.
8655000	8661000	Or even, you know, or even charades online.
8661000	8662000	Could you imagine that?
8662000	8663000	You know what I don't want to see?
8663000	8665000	That would be fun. I like that charades online idea.
8665000	8668000	But what I don't want to see is this whole brain scanning thing.
8668000	8670000	Have you heard about the brain devices?
8670000	8672000	Like the game that you control with your brain and all this stuff?
8672000	8674000	I don't like that idea.
8674000	8676000	I don't like that at all.
8676000	8679000	I hope that isn't where peripherals go next year.
8679000	8681000	I just, I don't like the whole thought reading thing.
8681000	8684000	It's kind of a little freaky to me.
8684000	8686000	Call me a warrior or whatever.
8686000	8689000	I just, you know, just a little weird.
8689000	8691000	Anything else in the mail, Ag?
8691000	8693000	Yes. Well, there's still more to that one.
8693000	8694000	Oh, my bad.
8694000	8696000	Yeah, Rob, duh.
8696000	8698000	Sorry, I have to give you a hard time.
8698000	8700000	As soon as I can find where the crap my thing went to.
8700000	8702000	There we go.
8702000	8705000	Also, I wondered where you guys get your news from.
8705000	8707000	Do you have a set or are you all over the place?
8707000	8712000	My favorite right now is games with a Z traffic dot com.
8712000	8714000	Look it up. Thanks, Mike.
8714000	8716000	I think you just gave somebody a free plug.
8716000	8718000	Why not? I don't mind.
8718000	8719000	Alright.
8719000	8721000	You know, I go Eurogamer for a lot of my stuff.
8721000	8725000	I use Google Reader and I feed several different websites into Google Reader.
8725000	8727000	You know why Google Reader is awesome?
8727000	8732000	Because, like, anybody that tries to firewall access to certain sites at certain places,
8732000	8734000	Google Reader gets around that.
8734000	8736000	Yes.
8736000	8738000	Also, another one.
8738000	8740000	Hi, everyone.
8740000	8742000	This is from Spazinator, by the way.
8742000	8745000	Hi, everyone. Seeing as this is topics and questions may possibly run a little long,
8745000	8748000	I opted to send them via email rather than Twitter.
8748000	8752000	Seeing as it's the end of the year and traditionally everyone seemingly does a top ten list of some sort,
8752000	8755000	why not have the O.L. Army do one?
8755000	8757000	But do one with a twist.
8757000	8763000	What I had in mind was a list of top games that came out this year that you love to have
8763000	8768000	the Hillary Clintons and the Voldemorts of the world be forced to play nonstop for days on end
8768000	8769000	just to drive them all crazy.
8769000	8771000	Well, even crazier than they already happen to be.
8771000	8774000	Also, seeing as the year is virtually over, I have two questions.
8774000	8778000	Compared to 2008, how do you feel about 2009 fared in regards to game releases,
8778000	8782000	sales of both consoles and games, as well as improvements to consoles,
8782000	8786000	and or their online services, both in terms of actual hardware revisions,
8786000	8790000	or as well as firmware updates.
8790000	8794000	I have no opinion. It's about the same.
8794000	8798000	I've got to say, I think 09 has been a lot more disappointing than 08.
8798000	8800000	I think we've had a lot of disappointments this year.
8800000	8804000	Games getting pushed back, quality of games, you know, don't seem to be up there.
8804000	8807000	I mean, there's lots of exceptions to this rule, don't get me wrong.
8807000	8809000	Of course, there's been some real gems that have been released this year,
8809000	8813000	but I think layoffs, et cetera, it's been a lot of disappointment this year.
8813000	8817000	I don't think there's a lot of good that came out of this year.
8817000	8823000	Except for, yeah, I got nothing.
8823000	8826000	President Cat is the good thing that came out this year, that's it.
8826000	8829000	Two, and as far as 2010 is concerned,
8829000	8832000	is there anything in particular that's been announced that you three are eagerly awaiting?
8832000	8835000	Do you have any possible predictions for 2010?
8835000	8837000	Or at least something you hope to see happen?
8837000	8842000	I hope that we get President Cat.
8842000	8847000	To kind of piggyback on what Loki was ranting about earlier,
8847000	8849000	I would really like to see Nintendo come out at E3
8849000	8852000	and do the system they should have done last time.
8852000	8858000	I understand that Wii was their gamble, yay for them, they won.
8858000	8860000	I would like to see them kind of take that up to the next level
8860000	8863000	and catch up finally to where their competitors are at
8863000	8865000	as far as the hardcore gamers are concerned,
8865000	8868000	with the HD and the online and all that fun stuff.
8868000	8874000	It's not going to happen, but you asked what I want to see.
8874000	8877000	And I'm always a big fan of more retro goodness,
8877000	8880000	so I would like to see more retro games coming back,
8880000	8884000	this whole achievements and trophies and cooperative online play.
8884000	8886000	I'm a big fan of all that stuff.
8886000	8891000	I wish the Virtual Console had achievements within it,
8891000	8895000	or ways that I could experience all these old games again with friends.
8895000	8900000	As neat as Virtual Console is for some of the great retro games,
8900000	8902000	it feels very lazy to me.
8902000	8906000	It's just an emulator you're paying for.
8906000	8910000	And to be fair, Xbox 360 has a lot of these games in their arcade, too.
8910000	8912000	I'm not just picking on Nintendo here.
8912000	8914000	A lot of arcade releases on 360,
8914000	8916000	and Microsoft finally put their foot down on this,
8916000	8920000	was just retro stuff that would throw in some achievements.
8920000	8922000	I don't know, I just would like to see retro games.
8922000	8923000	It has been a decent year for retro gaming.
8923000	8926000	I think it has been a decent year, though, for retro gaming already.
8926000	8928000	Because we've gotten certainly a lot of nods,
8928000	8931000	I mean, Bionic Commando, and...
8931000	8935000	You know, I really, though, want to see something really innovative.
8935000	8937000	I want to see something really original.
8937000	8939000	I want to see a game.
8939000	8942000	I want to see working designs come back,
8942000	8944000	and bring out all the cool stuff from Japan.
8944000	8946000	That's what I want.
8946000	8949000	I'm holding my breath.
8949000	8952000	Is that it for that email?
8952000	8953000	Or is there more?
8953000	8955000	I think that's it.
8955000	8956000	All right.
8956000	8957000	Yeah, that's it.
8957000	8960000	Mailbag at Orangelaunchrater.com is the place to send your emails.
8960000	8963000	Now we'll get into the decade a little bit,
8963000	8966000	and I don't want to linger too long on this,
8966000	8969000	but it's interesting that we're getting to the close of another decade here,
8969000	8973000	the O's or whatever we're going to end up calling these in the past.
8973000	8975000	If you think about it, it started.
8975000	8978000	Let me just rewind ten years ago here,
8978000	8984000	and I realize the majority of our listeners are somewhere between 18 and 25,
8984000	8988000	meaning when this decade started, you were between 8 and 15.
8988000	8992000	So, I mean, games have kind of evolved with many of you,
8992000	8994000	and of course, not all of our listeners.
8994000	8997000	Heck, the hosts don't fit into that age bracket.
8997000	9000000	I'm considerably older than that, as we all are,
9000000	9004000	but I realize that that's where a lot of the listener base is,
9004000	9006000	and just how much games have changed.
9006000	9009000	Just to kind of rewind ten years and show you how far we've come.
9009000	9014000	Here are some of the big things that happened in the year 2000.
9014000	9018000	PlayStation 2 was launched in the year 2000.
9018000	9021000	That's when the PlayStation 2 came out.
9021000	9025000	Let's see.
9025000	9030000	Nintendo finally sold its 100th millionth Game Boy handheld console.
9030000	9034000	Sega launched Sega Net into the year 2000,
9034000	9038000	and that's when the Dreamcast Championships took off.
9038000	9041000	Some of the games that came out in the year 2000.
9041000	9044000	The Sims came out January 31st of the year 2000.
9044000	9046000	I think it was almost ten years old.
9046000	9049000	Thief 2 came out in the year 2000.
9049000	9051000	Vagrant Story.
9051000	9054000	EverQuest came out in the year 2000.
9054000	9056000	Deus Ex.
9056000	9059000	Diablo 2 was from the year 2000.
9059000	9061000	That game feels even older.
9061000	9065000	Final Fantasy IX had a release in Japan in the year 2000.
9065000	9067000	Chrono Cross came out in 2000.
9067000	9070000	Dragon Quest VII.
9070000	9074000	American McGee's Alice.
9074000	9078000	The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask was in the year 2000.
9078000	9081000	What else we also had that year?
9081000	9083000	Seaman.
9083000	9085000	Was that really?
9085000	9089000	Seaman, do they have a lot of Dreamcast stuff on there?
9089000	9092000	Yeah, they account for Dreamcast on this list.
9092000	9097000	I think Seaman might have either been 2000 or 2001.
9097000	9100000	But yeah, the Dreamcast stuff was all early.
9100000	9102000	Escape from Monkey Island.
9102000	9104000	Tekken Tag Tournament.
9104000	9107000	Final Fantasy IX got its release over here too.
9107000	9109000	Skies of Arcadia.
9109000	9111000	Banjo-Tooie.
9111000	9112000	Here's some Dreamcast.
9112000	9115000	Grandia 2 came out towards the end of the year 2000.
9115000	9117000	Grandia 2, I played a lot of that.
9117000	9121000	I played through half of it in Japanese and then I was actually...
9121000	9126000	That's one of the games that I found out that my Japanese save file worked on the US one.
9126000	9128000	You know what else game did that?
9128000	9130000	Power Stone.
9130000	9132000	Wow.
9132000	9133000	So, think about it.
9133000	9134000	I mean, just to kind of go all the way back.
9134000	9139000	Ten years ago we were a completely different generation of video games.
9139000	9144000	Because the launch of the new generation, if you will, of games didn't really happen until...
9144000	9146000	What about 2005, 2006?
9146000	9150000	I think E3 is when we started hearing about this new round of consoles.
9150000	9151000	And then you go back.
9151000	9155000	I mean, heck, the GameCube just came out in, what, like 01?
9155000	9156000	Now we have the Wii.
9156000	9160000	I mean, we've gone through many, many different game systems in this generation.
9160000	9164000	So we would have had that all touched this last ten years.
9164000	9171000	We had the Dreamcast, the PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3, the GameCube, the Wii, the Xbox.
9171000	9175000	Microsoft got into gaming in these past few years, or not even ten years ago.
9175000	9177000	And the Xbox 360.
9177000	9180000	And then, of course, I'm not even counting handhelds and the countless amounts of those.
9180000	9184000	And, you know, other one-off systems that came out as well.
9184000	9187000	So it's going to be interesting, you know, in the next ten years, in the next generation,
9187000	9191000	just how far games go will probably be another generation.
9191000	9194000	We'll be talking about the PlayStation 4 and other Xboxes.
9194000	9198000	And maybe other companies that decide to get into gaming.
9198000	9200000	Or maybe one of these companies will buy another.
9200000	9201000	Who knows?
9201000	9203000	It's going to be very interesting to see what happens.
9203000	9207000	Before we open up the phone calls, and yes, some folks in chat want to point out,
9207000	9209000	OLR started in 2002.
9209000	9215000	So while we didn't exist ten years ago, we're getting into our eighth year of broadcasting.
9215000	9216000	That's quite some time.
9216000	9219000	It's pretty impressive.
9219000	9220000	What do you guys think?
9220000	9222000	And I know this is a very difficult question.
9222000	9224000	This is a very difficult question.
9224000	9229000	But what do you guys think were some of the best games to come out of the decade?
9229000	9232000	The best games to come out of all freaking decade.
9232000	9235000	Knowing that you have all of those systems available to you.
9235000	9240000	Not just maybe what was important to you, but what you think was important to gaming in general.
9240000	9242000	The decade.
9242000	9245000	Loki, do you want to start? Do you have anything?
9248000	9251000	DDR Max 2 in the arcade.
9251000	9252000	Why is that?
9252000	9254000	It was fun.
9254000	9258000	It got people back in the arcade because you had stuff that you were working to unlock.
9258000	9259000	I don't know.
9259000	9262000	I like 5th Mix too. That came out around the same.
9262000	9265000	These were also games that brought us together.
9265000	9266000	We wouldn't have OLR.
9266000	9271000	As much shit as we give Konami and their music division now, ten years ago was a different story.
9271000	9273000	We praised them. We loved them.
9273000	9276000	But they made a lot of mistakes, sadly.
9276000	9278000	That it? Anything on consoles you want to mention?
9278000	9279000	Oh yeah, of course.
9279000	9283000	Like Grand Theft Auto, I want to say 3 I think was around that time.
9283000	9286000	I know definitely San Andreas was around that time.
9286000	9290000	And those are pretty significant.
9290000	9294000	Other things I played that were really fun, let me think.
9300000	9304000	I like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but I can't remember when that came out.
9304000	9306000	I think that was around that time.
9309000	9312000	Gosh, I don't know. There's a lot of stuff I played.
9312000	9316000	It's hard to think back ten years. Everything I think about is more recent.
9316000	9319000	Final Fantasy X was pretty good.
9319000	9320000	Yeah, that was important.
9320000	9321000	That was pretty important.
9321000	9323000	11 for you. You spent a lot of time on that one.
9323000	9325000	I spent a lot of time on 11. That was fun.
9325000	9327000	First MMO?
9327000	9332000	Well, I played a little of my jerks online, but that sucked.
9335000	9337000	Gosh, yeah, it's tough.
9337000	9343000	Dark Sakura, anything you want to throw out there as far as your games of the decade?
9343000	9346000	Portal? Definitely Portal.
9346000	9348000	Seaman.
9348000	9350000	DDR?
9350000	9356000	Well, keep in mind, I got DDR for home in 2000 on Dreamcast.
9356000	9359000	Rod Caliber Rob.
9359000	9361000	Rod Caliber is important.
9361000	9363000	You remember Rod Caliber, don't you?
9363000	9366000	Yes, that's when you play Soul Caliber with the rod.
9366000	9369000	Yeah, exactly. Rod Caliber.
9369000	9381000	Also, I'd have to say, probably as far as shooters go, I'd say Ikaruga, getting Gradius 5.
9381000	9385000	There was a lot of good games that came out, though, in the decade.
9385000	9388000	So, I'd really say...
9388000	9394000	Well, if I say Portal, I should say Nurbacular Drop, because that's really the game that gave us Portal.
9394000	9401000	A lot of people thinking in interesting directions, especially with having the Dreamcast come out, the Naomi system, Hikaru after that.
9401000	9405000	Although, I still want Planet Harrier. Where is it?
9405000	9409000	It doesn't work. I tried it during the beginning of the show.
9409000	9410000	Damn!
9410000	9413000	Sorry, it still doesn't work in MAME.
9413000	9420000	As far as my answer to the question, I've answered this on another show, but to kind of repeat it here on Orange Launch Radio, I think I would split it up into a few categories.
9420000	9421000	Me and Skype?
9421000	9423000	No, you left yourself on.
9423000	9424000	Sorry.
9424000	9428000	Jamie's trying to have a sidebar conversation with me while I'm trying to talk on the internet.
9428000	9433000	Anyhow, what was I going to say? Oh yes, the game of the decade. Some things that came up.
9433000	9441000	My personal favorite game of the decade, I think, was probably Animal Crossing, was one I really remember.
9441000	9444000	I loved how you...
9444000	9452000	As much slack as that game got for running around doing nothing, if you really went far with it, where you could go into somebody else's village...
9452000	9456000	You brought your friend over with a memory card, and I remember we used to do this shit all the time.
9456000	9461000	Somebody would come over and we'd visit the town and try to get their townspeople to say dirty words and all this stuff.
9461000	9467000	It was just a lot of fun. And also the fact that it had all the retro Nintendo games in it before Nintendo started gouging the prices for all this stuff.
9467000	9475000	I just loved that game when it first came out, and it kind of sucks that the game's franchise has been milked through the DS and the Wii versions.
9475000	9477000	It's just not really as fun anymore as it used to be.
9477000	9486000	But that very first Animal Crossing that was on the GameCube in America, yes, I realize it's based off a Nintendo 64 game, but I'm not counting that because I didn't have an impact on our culture here in the US.
9486000	9492000	That first Animal Crossing on the GameCube, I think, was probably one of the best gaming experiences I had all decade.
9492000	9503000	As far as on a technical level, I know Loki's gonna kind of hate me for this, but I think Wii Sports, you have to recognize, is one of the best games of the decade because it got people to play games who don't play games.
9503000	9507000	You see Wii Sports in nursing homes, for Christ's sake.
9507000	9509000	But we didn't want those people playing games!
9509000	9515000	You still have to recognize, though, that's still money in the gaming industry that can someday make a game you might want to play.
9515000	9521000	No, it won't, because they'll be catering to these people that don't really care about games, but they like Wii Sports.
9521000	9532000	Okay, okay, hold on. But without Wii Sports, and basically the Wii in general, would we have Project Natal and the Sony ice cream cones, which may bring us the games you want to play, Loki?
9532000	9535000	I'm still skeptical on what they're gonna bring out.
9535000	9540000	I'm skeptical too, but there is a possibility it could be pretty fucking awesome.
9540000	9544000	And we would have Wii Sports to thank for that, like it or not.
9544000	9551000	Let's see, also I would say probably a good combination of both of those, both just personal favorite and I think it did a lot for gaming.
9551000	9560000	World of Warcraft. Haters gonna hate. I know there's a lot of people that are anti-MMOs out there, but I think World of Warcraft did amazing stuff for online games.
9560000	9568000	I think just for all, I think the way Blizzard kind of caters to the different audiences, Blizzard is like the best PC game maker.
9568000	9576000	They are. They don't make, name a bad Blizzard game.
9576000	9589000	I don't think there is one. Like maybe if you want to go back to like the Lost Vikings or shit that was out like years and years ago, but Blizzard, and to be fair, Blizzard doesn't make a lot of games, but World of Warcraft was great.
9589000	9596000	And they continue to make it better and the expansions have been good and I mean 11 million people play this game and sometimes people you wouldn't expect.
9596000	9601000	It's kind of created this whole new culture. It's been parodied on South Park and so forth.
9601000	9603000	Which was a very funny episode.
9603000	9609000	Yes, it was a very funny episode. I saw this list on Yahoo and I actually thought it was not a bad compilation.
9609000	9617000	A lot of times I roll my eyes at these sites when they want to do a top 10 games of the decade, but I actually think Yahoo did a decent job.
9617000	9624000	I wanted to share this with you guys. Again, this is coming from videogames.yahoo.com. This was their picks for the top 10 of the decade.
9624000	9632000	Number 10 from the year 2007, Super Mario Galaxy. I know Loki is a big fan of that, so Super Mario Galaxy from 2007.
9632000	9636000	That's alright. I'm just saying Super Mario Galaxy 2 is not going to be that great.
9636000	9639000	Number 9, Half Life 2.
9639000	9640000	Definitely.
9640000	9648000	I think sometimes I've forgotten about game from all of us console hoarding folks, but the orange box did bring this back to the forefront.
9648000	9651000	Half Life 2 is a hugely important PC game.
9651000	9661000	Just for the way it integrated story into the shooter game and the graphical level and just the fact that the game, you didn't really go from level to level.
9661000	9663000	You were immersed in the game.
9663000	9667000	I think it did a lot for gaming in that regard. That's a pretty good pick.
9667000	9671000	Some folks will probably put that a lot higher on their list. I don't know, but they put it in number 9.
9671000	9676000	Again, this list is coming from Yahoo video games and they write little blurbs with each of these I'm not going to read.
9676000	9680000	Wii Fit they put on their list in the year 2007.
9680000	9683000	This is the only one I take a little bit of issue with. I get why it's here.
9683000	9689000	They're putting this here for the same reason I named Wii Sports earlier because it opened up gaming to people that wouldn't usually play games.
9689000	9696000	But is it a game or is it something that uses a game console to accomplish what it really wants to do? I don't know.
9696000	9703000	I like this entry. I think this is often overlooked. Number 7, Bejeweled from the year 2001. The original Bejeweled.
9703000	9704000	I can see that.
9704000	9711000	I can totally see that too and I think a lot of folks forget what PopCap and casual gaming has done for gaming in this decade.
9711000	9713000	I think that's a very important game to note.
9713000	9717000	Number 6, they put Wii Sports. I don't think I need to say anything else with that.
9717000	9720000	Number 5, they put Halo.
9720000	9724000	I don't think the Xbox would have survived if it wasn't for Halo.
9724000	9728000	I think we'd be looking at the Xbox kind of like we look at the Atari Jaguar, honestly.
9728000	9736000	I think Xbox kind of pushed, and especially Halo 2, kind of pushed the Xbox to what ended up happening on the 360.
9736000	9741000	I think Halo was huge.
9741000	9745000	And certainly Yahoo and their video game related site does too.
9745000	9750000	You know Rob, it's all about Pest Society and Farmville.
9750000	9754000	And number 4 was Guitar Hero they put on the list.
9754000	9761000	And it's very interesting having done this as a music game based show when it was a very niche thing.
9761000	9768000	It's very interesting that we have kind of watched music games explode into the mainstream and a lot of this is because of Guitar Hero.
9768000	9773000	And they finally did what Konami should have thought to do a long fucking time ago.
9773000	9780000	Or excuse me, what Konami of Japan should have taken a risk on a long time ago and stopped being so bullheaded when it comes to releasing stuff in the US.
9780000	9783000	And that is put in the songs that people in the US want to play.
9783000	9791000	And granted, I know those of us here in studio and a lot of our long time listeners were fans of stuff that Konami was putting in those music games a long time ago.
9791000	9795000	But we were a niche audience and those games were never going to break through.
9795000	9798000	Guitar Hero finally broke it through and I think that's important to note.
9798000	9801000	And it debuted in our living room, in my living room.
9801000	9804000	That's right, you guys had like a sneak peek.
9804000	9808000	I wasn't here that day but you and Loki were on the news doing some sneak peek thing with Guitar Hero.
9808000	9809000	I remember that, that was cool.
9809000	9810000	That was pretty fun.
9810000	9817000	Just because I happen to have a big TV that wouldn't, you know, had a better refresh rate.
9817000	9822000	I just want to point out a lot of our chatters because I'm kind of keeping one eye on chat.orangelandrado.com.
9822000	9823000	So some interesting comments.
9823000	9827000	GameGuru, Half Life 2 also introduced Steam onto the world.
9827000	9829000	That was the first one that had Steam in it.
9829000	9833000	And then quite a few folks yelling out PEGAL better than Bejeweled.
9833000	9834000	I love PEGAL.
9834000	9835000	I do love PEGAL too.
9835000	9836000	Especially on iPhone.
9836000	9838000	But I think without Bejeweled you wouldn't have PEGAL.
9838000	9840000	So I can see why they opted to put PEGAL on the list.
9840000	9848000	Well I mean, shoot, without Tetris or Puzzle Bobble we wouldn't have, without Plinko we wouldn't have PEGAL.
9848000	9853000	The number three game on Yahoo's list, The Sims, was the most important game of the decade.
9853000	9856000	And you know what, I think The Sims was pretty fucking awesome.
9856000	9859000	It was the best PC selling game for a long time.
9859000	9862000	It might still be with all those expansions, I'm not sure.
9862000	9868000	But the number two game is another PC game, World of Warcraft, they put on their list for pretty much the same reasons I did.
9868000	9871000	So number one game, any guesses?
9871000	9874000	Big trendy things that haven't been named yet for the game of the decade?
9874000	9876000	Modern Warfare 2.
9876000	9877000	It's game of the decade?
9877000	9879000	Yep, they're going to do that.
9879000	9880000	Okay.
9880000	9884000	Uh, I got nothing.
9884000	9887000	Grand Theft Auto 3 they named as the number one game of the decade, Grand Theft Auto 3.
9887000	9890000	As it rightly should be.
9890000	9891000	From 2001.
9891000	9893000	I thought they would punk out and go.
9893000	9899000	No, I mean, Grand Theft Auto 3 was really the first sandbox-y type of game like that, right?
9899000	9904000	And just opened up this whole new type of video game, practically.
9904000	9912000	I have to admit, usually I look at those lists and roll my eyes, but maybe with the exception of Wii Fit, that was a pretty good list, I gotta say.
9912000	9914000	Let's see what you guys think about there.
9914000	9916000	Some of our folks in chat disagree.
9916000	9923000	I don't know though, I realize Grand Theft Auto 3 might not be the type of game you play, but think about that whole sandbox type of game.
9923000	9928000	I mean, Grand Theft Auto was really kind of the pioneer in that, and I think without Grand Theft Auto 3 you wouldn't have that.
9928000	9936000	Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and open up our Skype line and see what you guys have to say about the year in gaming and the decade in gaming.
9936000	9938000	And honestly, it's just an open forum tonight.
9938000	9944000	Whatever you guys want to talk about, it's our last show of the decade, so please give us a call.
9944000	9954000	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or you can always reach us on Skype at username ORANGELOUNGERADIO is the place to call.
9954000	9959000	Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls to come in, do we have any last minute stories, Loki?
9959000	9962000	I haven't been looking at last minute stories.
9962000	9964000	Yeah, I'm sure we do have some.
9964000	9968000	Oh good, you're saved because we have a call coming in right now, so let's go ahead and take this call.
9968000	9971000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9971000	9972000	Hi, this is HackDeft.
9972000	9974000	Hi HackDeft, how you doing?
9974000	9975000	Pretty good.
9975000	9981000	Well, we're talking about, of course, the year in games, the decade in games, or really whatever you want to talk about tonight. What's on your mind?
9981000	9988000	Well, first of all, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, a late Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.
9988000	9990000	Same to you?
9990000	9991000	Thanks.
9991000	9994000	And I want to talk about my game of the year.
9994000	9995000	Which is?
9995000	9996000	Possibly.
9996000	9998000	Forza Motorsport 3.
9998000	10004000	Ah, okay. That hasn't been mentioned yet on the show, but I can see that as somebody's choice.
10004000	10007000	What is it about this game that makes it the game of the year for you?
10007000	10015000	I can explain it in only one phrase. It's racing simulation for dummies.
10015000	10022000	And why does that make it game of the year? I mean, Mario Kart Wii is kind of racing simulation for dummies, right?
10022000	10038000	Well, Mario Kart Wii is more like an arcade style of racing, while Forza is more of a simulation like Gran Turismo, where if you make a bad turn, you will crash.
10038000	10043000	If you go too fast, you'll crash, and if you do everything wrong, you'll crash.
10043000	10063000	And not like in Gran Turismo or any other racing game, your car has damages, and possibly, well, not possibly, and it will affect your racing.
10063000	10072000	Is it just the realism in that regard that makes this the game of the year for you, or is it like a graphical achievement, or what is it that just makes this game so awesome?
10072000	10084000	Everything. It has the graphics, it has the gameplay, it has the online, it has everything you can ask in a game, it has it in racing form.
10084000	10091000	Like, the online community, I haven't played that much online, but it's good, and it has a lot of options.
10091000	10103000	You can customize your car in tuning, you can paint it, you can make stickers or decals, and make your own car.
10103000	10108000	It's like the teddy bear workshop, but in car form.
10108000	10129000	And like I said, it's a pretty easy game to pick up, because the options let you begin to play, you have a lot of things that help you to race along and complete the challenges and all the tournaments and races you have to compete in.
10129000	10139000	But if you're truly a racing expert, it also has all that other stuff that makes you like the game.
10139000	10142000	It makes a real simulation.
10142000	10149000	Alright, well the only criteria that you really have to use is the type of game that you enjoy, it's just your criteria and no one else's.
10149000	10152000	So if that's your game of the year, then so be it.
10152000	10155000	Well, we appreciate the call and you chiming in on your game of the year.
10155000	10157000	Are there any other quick thoughts you have for us tonight?
10157000	10165000	Well, other than that, I think that also Street Fighter IV is also a candidate for game of the year.
10165000	10168000	A game that will offer you as a studio name.
10168000	10173000	How do you say it? The rebirth of fighting games.
10173000	10177000	It definitely did energize fighting games in kind of a new way this year.
10177000	10183000	And it's interesting, having played Tekken 6 this week, I feel like Street Fighter IV did inspire some things in it.
10183000	10184000	We'll see.
10184000	10185000	Yeah.
10185000	10189000	Alright, well thank you so much ActDeaf for the call. You have a great new year and be safe, okay?
10189000	10190000	Thanks, you too.
10190000	10191000	Alright, later.
10191000	10197000	Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10197000	10199000	We are open and taking some calls.
10199000	10202000	And I know the call, the phones have been ringing.
10202000	10209000	So we're going to wait here and try to get a call when it comes through.
10209000	10213000	Of course, now that I say that, nobody's calling in. It's like everybody's waiting because they still hear ActDeaf on the line.
10213000	10214000	Oh, we got another call coming in.
10214000	10216000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10216000	10219000	This is that one across the ocean, AkiRipper.
10219000	10220000	Hello AkiRipper.
10220000	10221000	Hello.
10221000	10224000	So good to hear from you. How are things in your neck of the woods?
10224000	10232000	It's fun. It's quite fun. We have like, mostly fun, there's like, what is it?
10232000	10236000	We have like a few feet of snow.
10236000	10247000	And we have like, well, what is it? Like 20 minus degrees Celsius for a night like around minus something to something degrees.
10247000	10251000	And, well, yay.
10251000	10259000	Well, we're talking about, of course, by the way, it's been snowing here a little bit too and that was really creepy when that happened because it usually doesn't snow here.
10259000	10266000	But it was kind of funny. You'd be very amused at how people freaked out over here at a little bit of snow when it wasn't even really snow.
10266000	10268000	It was just like an eighth of an inch.
10268000	10270000	It was like hail that stayed.
10270000	10275000	I know, really. Anyhow, well, we're talking about, of course, video games and our games of the year and the decade.
10275000	10277000	Anything you want to bring to this conversation?
10277000	10285000	Game of the year is Sims 3, judging by the amount that I've played it.
10285000	10292000	What makes Sims 3 your game of the year? I'm sure DarkSakura wouldn't argue with that, but what was it for you that made that game for you?
10292000	10305000	Well, I'm new to this whole Sims game, so to say, since Sims 3 was the first Sims game that I really got addicted to.
10305000	10320000	Add to the following fact that I haven't played WoW in almost a year now, so, well, there is that.
10320000	10329000	And then there is the following fact that my computers tend to explode every new MMO release.
10329000	10335000	It happened with Warhammer last year, and it happened with Aion.
10335000	10345000	And, well, once I get to fix my computers, I have no desire to play any of those MMOs, unfortunately.
10345000	10351000	What do you think it is? You know, we heard a lot this year about Aion possibly being the first game that's finally going to really challenge WoW,
10351000	10356000	and then all of a sudden it kind of landed with this big, you know, like it just landed with a thud.
10356000	10361000	You know, why is it that no MMO can take on WoW, you think?
10361000	10377000	In my case, I don't know, since, well, as I said, my computers tend to just die a few weeks after it's been released, or the first week it is released.
10377000	10390000	And, well, there seems to be this unlucky... I have this sudden streak of unlocked, and it's quite annoying.
10390000	10402000	Other mentions, well, Shadow Complex and Dragon Age Origins.
10402000	10417000	Even though Dragon Age Origins has been said before, because of the only games I play is mostly like The Sims 3,
10417000	10423000	so I can't play, haven't played, since Dragon Age Origins that much.
10423000	10427000	You know, I gotta say, I'm having similar problems, I think, to you in regards to my computer just kind of goes,
10427000	10432000	eh, can't do it when trying to play Dragon Age. I probably should have picked it up on the console, but I don't know why,
10432000	10436000	Dragon Age just feels like a game I need to play on the PC, so, you know, and that's where the good deal was.
10436000	10441000	So, but yeah, that's a game that wasn't really mentioned before, it's a possible Game of the Year contender,
10441000	10446000	and I think definitely a lot of big, big fans of that game, so.
10446000	10460000	Other than that, well, this year I actually got a 360, so, well, yay on me. Supposedly so.
10460000	10465000	A lot of people joined in the Xbox 360 Club and the PS3 Club this year, too, with the Slim.
10465000	10469000	Anyway, Acre Reaper, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call,
10469000	10471000	and getting in tonight, alright?
10471000	10472000	Yeah, well, better.
10472000	10474000	Have a good New Year!
10474000	10477000	He gets to see it before we do, because of his time zone, just so you know.
10477000	10480000	So, he'll have to let us know how it is.
10480000	10483000	Alright, we got another call coming in. Phones, we're getting off the hook tonight.
10483000	10484000	Let's go to another call.
10484000	10486000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10486000	10488000	Hello, it's Maren.
10488000	10490000	Hi, Maren, how are you?
10490000	10494000	I'm very good, thank you. How's everybody in the Orange Lounge Radio studio?
10494000	10497000	We are doing good. You should know you were here last week.
10497000	10501000	Yes, I was. I apparently came the wrong weekend.
10501000	10502000	Geez.
10502000	10503000	Why's that?
10503000	10510000	So, anyways, I just wanted to talk about Game of the Year slash Game of the Decade caps.
10510000	10513000	Please, please, yes. What would be your Game of the Year?
10513000	10517000	At first, I just wanted to say I'm glad to hear you got home safe, because I know you drove all the way,
10517000	10518000	and that's not a fun drive.
10518000	10519000	No.
10519000	10521000	But what was your Game of the Year and the Game of the Decade?
10521000	10525000	My Game of the Year definitely was Beatles' rock band.
10525000	10533000	As DarkSakura knows, because she was at my house visiting in the summer, I am a very, very, very big Beatles fan,
10533000	10539000	so it was nice to get a rock band game that had a lot of songs that I know,
10539000	10542000	as opposed to most of them, where I don't know a lot of the songs,
10542000	10545000	because I'm an old fart and I only listen to oldies music.
10545000	10551000	There's a lot of people just like you, though, that do that. They don't understand kids today.
10551000	10555000	No, those kids and their strange music.
10555000	10562000	So, yeah, it was nice to have a rock band game where I could actually sing all of the songs and enjoy myself.
10562000	10566000	It wasn't as hardcore, I don't think, as the other rock band games,
10566000	10570000	but it was fun for me and it was something I really enjoyed.
10570000	10574000	It was put together beautifully, too, I think is one of the great things about it,
10574000	10576000	is just visually it's a cool game.
10576000	10578000	Dude, that bass was awesome.
10578000	10584000	Yeah, it's really great and I still like every time that I play through the game and I play the end,
10584000	10588000	there's like one part where Paul starts to sing end in the end and I'm like,
10588000	10591000	I love you, Paul, it's so great.
10591000	10597000	It's like you're back in the 1960s screaming at the Ed Sullivan Theater at the Beatles on the stage. Amazing.
10597000	10604000	And actually what was funny was that I went to, when I was visiting, we played Beatles Rock Band
10604000	10613000	and Dark Soccer has got the whole woofer sub surround sound, weird, all that crazy stuff.
10613000	10618000	And when you were playing the songs that were live in Shea Stadium,
10618000	10623000	one of the speakers that was behind us was all the girls screaming.
10623000	10629000	And so it was just kind of funny to be playing and hearing girls screaming like crazy behind you.
10629000	10630000	That's funny.
10630000	10634000	What about Game of the Decade? Is this also your Game of the Decade or do you have a different pick?
10634000	10637000	Game of the Decade was kind of more difficult.
10637000	10644000	I decided to go with something that came out actually at the beginning of the decade and that was Diablo II.
10644000	10647000	We mentioned that in our 2000 list, yeah?
10647000	10655000	Yeah, and I think Diablo II definitely paved the way for a lot of the kind of games that we enjoy now,
10655000	10659000	like World of Warcraft, Warcraft III, things like that.
10659000	10665000	And it was just overall a really good game and I still play that.
10665000	10667000	Yeah, there's still a lot of people playing that.
10667000	10670000	There's still no Diablo III. There's still a lot of people playing Diablo II.
10670000	10676000	But it's funny you kind of say that Diablo II paved the way for games like WoW because I really do agree.
10676000	10681000	In fact, I used to kind of joke in World of Warcraft that it really should have just been called World of Diablo
10681000	10683000	because that's kind of how it plays.
10683000	10684000	Yeah, it really does.
10684000	10686000	It plays a little more like Diablo and it is Warcraft.
10686000	10693000	But yeah, there's so many great games that came out of this decade,
10693000	10698000	but I think Diablo II really paved the way for a lot of other games and it was just overall really a good game.
10698000	10705000	Like I said, I still play it, so if it's a game that you can play 10 years later, then that's something worthwhile.
10705000	10709000	I think that's a darn good pick, so I'm not going to argue with you there.
10709000	10714000	Maybe even though I picked something different, I can certainly see where Diablo II, without that we would not have had WoW.
10714000	10716000	So it's a very good pick.
10716000	10720000	And Battle.net and this whole infrastructure they had to build for that too.
10720000	10723000	That's something that's continuing to evolve for them.
10723000	10727000	Well, anything else on your mind tonight before we get to some more calls?
10727000	10732000	No, that's it. I know you guys are ringing off the hook because I've tried calling in a few times before I got through.
10732000	10736000	So I'll go ahead and let you go and it was nice chatting with you guys again.
10736000	10738000	Thank you. It was very good to chat with you too.
10738000	10741000	I think that we should take this opportunity though for a plug.
10741000	10744000	I was actually going to say, yeah, before I let her go, I know you guys.
10744000	10748000	Because this is how I know something's up.
10748000	10753000	I came to the studio tonight and usually by the time I get here, which is about 5.15ish,
10753000	10758000	I'm helping Dark Sakura set up kind of the studio and the mic and get the computer on and everything.
10758000	10760000	Tonight it was already done.
10760000	10763000	And I'm thinking, something's up.
10763000	10766000	Either this is my Christmas present.
10766000	10771000	So something's going on. I'm joking obviously. But what's going on you guys?
10771000	10779000	Well, we've had our long running segment of my blog, which is Monday Comic Mania.
10779000	10783000	And it's just where Dark Sakura and I kind of blog about upcoming comics in the week.
10783000	10790000	And so we decided like last week when I was there to just kind of play around with the idea of doing a podcast of it.
10790000	10792000	And we got a lot of positive feedback.
10792000	10801000	So we are starting to do that on a regular basis and we actually did record our second episode today.
10801000	10803000	It was pretty fun too.
10803000	10805000	So where can they download the podcast if they want to check that out?
10805000	10810000	If they want to check that out, they can go to AvengersTower.com.
10810000	10815000	I see what's going on here. You're trying to ninja Dark Sakura from our show. That's what's going on.
10815000	10818000	Well, to be fair, I've known Dark Sakura longer than you have.
10818000	10820000	Alright. Oh, touche.
10820000	10821000	Yeah, Rob.
10821000	10826000	Touche. Alright, no. I obviously am a big fan of independent podcasting. I think that's great.
10826000	10832000	So she's allowed to have a, I don't want to say a solo project because that's not what it is, but a side project.
10832000	10833000	An affiliate program.
10833000	10834000	That's right.
10834000	10842000	You know, we did want to ask you to be the voice of our introduction for our podcast. So we would love to have you do that.
10842000	10848000	Well, that's a very lovely compliment and I would love to do that. Just let me know what you need me to say and I'll record that for you, okay?
10848000	10850000	I told you beforehand.
10850000	10854000	Oh, yeah. You need, you want me to do it after the show tonight. I'll be happy to do that for you tonight. Sure. Sure.
10854000	10855000	Great. Well, thank you guys.
10855000	10856000	No problem.
10856000	10861000	Alright, ToaGak in our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com wants us to fight over Dark Sakura.
10861000	10867000	So we will have to settle this in a battle of strip poker, clearly, is the only possible answer.
10867000	10871000	Alright, we'll make it a date next time that I'm up in Sacramento.
10871000	10873000	It's going to be one hot date. Yeah.
10873000	10874000	Oh, baby.
10874000	10876000	And no, it will not be broadcast on the internet.
10876000	10880000	Alright. No, Maren, thank you so much for the call. You take care and have a great new year, okay?
10880000	10881000	You too. Thanks.
10881000	10882000	Later.
10883000	10887000	Bochi Kawa in chat says they're just trying to bribe me with the introduction speech.
10887000	10891000	Alright, let's get to another call. I think this is going to be our last call of the night.
10891000	10897000	And from what I understand, the 1877 number is not working and I apologize for that. I don't know what the hell's going on.
10897000	10901000	That would be one of those things I don't find out about until the show starts, so I apologize.
10901000	10904000	Anyhow, Rama, you're on the phone. What's up?
10904000	10907000	Well, you couldn't have an end-of-year show without me, guys.
10907000	10912000	You do seem like a fitting personality to have here at the end of the year. What's on your mind?
10912000	10917000	Not too much. I just want to give what I thought was my game of the year.
10917000	10919000	Well, please, what was your game of the year?
10919000	10922000	Ghostbusters, the video game.
10922000	10923000	That was awesome.
10923000	10926000	You know what's funny? Yes, it was.
10926000	10929000	What was about this game? What made it so goddamn awesome?
10929000	10937000	You know how whenever you do a movie to video game, the video game generally sucks donkey balls.
10937000	10943000	Ghostbusters the video game was one of those shining gems where it came out really good.
10943000	10951000	Granted, it's not really based off the movie. On the same token, it's like a sequel to the first two movies.
10951000	10957000	But you still kind of go through elements of the first two movies as you play the game, which I thought was fun.
10957000	10963000	But game of the year, Rama? Is that enough to make this game of the year?
10963000	10966000	What is it about the game itself that just made you go,
10966000	10969000	you know, above everything else I played this year, I love this the most?
10969000	10973000	Well, number one, I'm not a sports fan.
10973000	10980000	Number two, I am an RPG fan, but I can't sit there and play them enough to say that so-and-so RPG is game of the year.
10980000	10986000	And I'm kind of fed up with all the music, band, games, so on and so forth.
10986000	10991000	Are you still there? Hello?
10991000	10992000	Yeah, I'm right here.
10992000	10994000	Oh, God, it sounded like you cut out for a minute there. I was like, ah!
10994000	10995000	Sorry.
10995000	11002000	No, that's okay. It's just up your genre. It's the genre you want to do and you're just kind of sick of the other saturated genres.
11002000	11003000	Well, that's fair enough.
11003000	11007000	What about the bigger question? I don't know if you gave this any thought, but what about the game of the decade?
11007000	11010000	Game of the decade, wow.
11010000	11011000	I know, this is so much.
11011000	11013000	Wow.
11013000	11021000	I don't think I can really pinpoint a game of the decade. I don't think I really could. I'd actually have to sit there and think about that.
11021000	11029000	You know, I don't think a lot of people could truly, even though we read this list off of Yahoo and so forth and said, you know, they did a pretty good job at least of where to start,
11029000	11035000	I don't think you will truly be able to know what the biggest games of the decade were until about five years from now,
11035000	11041000	when you're really able to look back, accurately look back and say, okay, what games really shaped where we're at now?
11041000	11048000	You can kind of do that a little bit with the earlier games in the decade. For instance, we were having a chat earlier about how Diablo 2 ultimately shaped World of Warcraft.
11048000	11057000	You know, I think it'll be interesting to see, because if some of these things like Natal and the Sony ice cream cone fail,
11057000	11062000	then you can say that maybe Wii Sports wasn't as big as we thought it was. Maybe it really was just a flash in the pan.
11062000	11066000	But if these two things blow up, then it kind of adds value to Wii Sports in a way.
11066000	11075000	Pretty much. I mean, I can't really say on the PC side of things with Diablo, because I grew up mostly doing console gaming.
11075000	11080000	And I had a PC, but nothing worthy of playing half these games that are out there.
11080000	11085000	And when I saw some of these games in the store, I was always drawing towards the console games.
11085000	11091000	Yeah, and that's a lot of people in that same boat. There's a lot of people also the exact opposite.
11091000	11096000	They just can't get into the consoles. They have to play on the PC with the keyboard and the mouse, or it just doesn't work.
11096000	11099000	It's one of the reasons why I don't play Halo.
11099000	11107000	Alright. Well, Rama, you're going to be the last call of the year. Do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
11107000	11114000	Yeah, a couple of things. Number one, a few podcast episodes back, you had mentioned whatever happened to Trade West.
11114000	11115000	Yes.
11115000	11121000	I think a couple of years after they did Double Dragon, they were acquired by Midway.
11121000	11124000	Oh, okay. Alright.
11124000	11128000	So they're pretty much no more, is my assumption.
11128000	11133000	Sure, sure. And that makes sense, because I want to say Midway did some Double Dragon games later on, so that makes total sense.
11133000	11142000	And last thing I'll leave this note on to you, Jamie, Matt, thank you.
11142000	11144000	You're welcome.
11144000	11145000	You're welcome.
11145000	11157000	No, really. I mean, I tune in every Sunday to listen to you guys talk about gaming, and from time to time, you guys move off of gaming, talk about stuff in your personal lives, which do affect all of us.
11157000	11165000	And I like the fact that we can come together as a family and discuss some of these things, like Proposition 8 and so forth.
11165000	11181000	That was something I really appreciate, so it was like that one time, take DV from the gaming, talk about something that's more important, more of an impact in our lives that we need to discuss, and see how we all feel about that.
11181000	11186000	So that's something I appreciate, and you know what, thank you.
11186000	11199000	Well, thank you very much. It makes us feel very good about what we do, certainly, and I know that sometimes I'm kind of joking. Sometimes my role on the show is to try and make sure we get back to the games at some point.
11199000	11212000	Obviously, I've certainly, with some of the things you mentioned, kind of gone astray myself, and I'm really thankful that the audience has let us do that, has come to grow to let us do that, and not expect that we're just going to be all games all the time.
11212000	11219000	But I think it really speaks, especially this time of year. These are the types of things we think about as the family and what's important to us.
11219000	11234000	And I think there is a sense of family in our listenership that is astounding, and it's been something that's kind of grown through this whole decade, and it's going to continue on over the next few...
11234000	11235000	We are the LL Army.
11235000	11236000	That's right.
11236000	11248000	It's like, you know, at first I felt like I should be kind of offended that you're bringing in personal stuff, but then I realized, if you guys don't talk about it and bring it up, who is? I mean, we all listen to you guys.
11248000	11255000	You're like the voice of gaming to us, you know? We're like one giant, happy mafia family.
11255000	11259000	Oh God, don't put that responsibility on us or we might get scared. No, I...
11259000	11262000	I've already got a whole bag full of tattoos now.
11262000	11264000	That's what's up.
11264000	11272000	You know what's funny is that, you know, and I've said this before, and I know I've gotten into this story on the show a million times, but the very first episode of Orange Lawns Radio, there were 12 people listening.
11272000	11277000	And we thought we were fucking rock stars because I was like, whoa, double digits. We fucking rock.
11277000	11281000	You know, like I honestly thought it was like the best thing ever.
11281000	11286000	But, you know, at the end of the day, I think there were seriously some episodes where we had more people at the house during the taping.
11286000	11290000	Remember the house we used to do the show from the very beginning? Then there were people that were listening.
11290000	11297000	But it was just kind of about getting together and having fun and not really caring about the listeners as a number.
11297000	11299000	Not the listener count.
11299000	11303000	Yeah, as a number, as an inanimate object that you couldn't really see.
11303000	11312000	But kind of watching it grow and then kind of get big with the whole podcasting thing into an audience that really interacts with us and so forth has been just really amazing.
11312000	11322000	Well, it's like every single person that listens to us is a person, not a statistic. You know, we may say, oh, well, 90 people tuned in this week. Yay.
11322000	11331000	And, oh, this many people downloaded it. But each and every one of you listening to this, either recorded or live right now, you are a person.
11331000	11337000	And I appreciate that you're all taking time out of your day to dedicate a little time to us.
11337000	11343000	Not just a little time. This show's fucking long. I don't know if you're aware, but like three, it's up four hours sometimes.
11343000	11349000	It's an exchange. We'll dedicate our time to you. You dedicate some time to us and it works.
11349000	11352000	And that really is all we've ever asked. You know, tell people about the show. Help spread the word.
11352000	11355000	And send me donuts. I really like donuts.
11355000	11365000	It's a quick little exchange. I mean, I don't mean to cut you guys off, but through the various jobs I've had, as long as I've been listening to the show, I've made sure that I would arrange my schedule so I would listen to you guys.
11365000	11370000	I stopped what I do on Sundays to come in here and be with you guys, you know?
11370000	11376000	If it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be able to do my own podcast. I mean, I thank you guys for that, you know?
11376000	11381000	I mean, if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be able to do this, you know?
11381000	11383000	We want you to come back and see us too.
11383000	11385000	Because Fannie Mae was a blast.
11385000	11393000	I'm planning on it. And working on bringing Jodea, Misty, I'm working on it one way or another.
11393000	11398000	Even if that means I've got to pack them in boxes and ship them metal here, Solid Snake style.
11398000	11401000	We'll be there for the 4th of July, you know?
11401000	11403000	Alright. I'm holding you to that.
11403000	11409000	Dude, I'm actually wanting to get to New York. I mean, I would love to find my way up there sometime.
11409000	11415000	You know, it's been since I was 17 years old was the last time. The one and only time, I think.
11415000	11419000	No, I went once when I was an infant, so therefore I don't remember it.
11419000	11422000	But that was the last time I went to New York.
11422000	11428000	Look at it this way, Amy. If you come out here, Patty has a room just for you.
11428000	11432000	The bed is ready and everything. It says Dark Soccer Guest Room right there.
11432000	11434000	Really?
11434000	11436000	So who's got $400 I can borrow, huh?
11436000	11440000	Sister Act is supposed to be on Broadway this next year. I'm coming out there to see that, you know that.
11440000	11443000	Alright, anyhow, Rama, this is also going on the longest call of the decade.
11443000	11445000	So I have to say, thank you.
11445000	11446000	I'm sorry.
11446000	11448000	No, it was all worth it. Thank you. Have a wonderful night.
11448000	11451000	And thank you for being a long time supporter of the show. We really appreciate it.
11451000	11454000	And really a lot of people that called in tonight were in that same boat.
11454000	11455000	So thank you, Rama. Take care.
11455000	11457000	Have fun. Take care.
11457000	11460000	Again, apologies to those that didn't get through.
11460000	11464000	And apologies that the 877 number apparently was borked and I was unaware.
11464000	11468000	I didn't do that on purpose. Apologize to you guys who weren't able to get through because of that.
11468000	11472000	But we are going to leave it at that note. Of course we'll be back here next week.
11472000	11477000	We always are. To do it all again. Take more calls. Do more emails. Do it again.
11477000	11481000	Until our lives change and we're just not able to do it anymore.
11481000	11484000	Don't know when that's going to be. I don't want to focus on that right now.
11484000	11487000	Let's just focus on what a great decade it's been for video games.
11487000	11490000	And it's just going to continue to grow and who knows what the future holds.
11490000	11492000	It's going to be crazy.
11492000	11495000	Well, it's that part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
11495000	11499000	Actually, quickly, are there any last minute stories? I forgot to have Loki clear those out.
11499000	11503000	Just really quickly, stupid things. Like I mentioned before, Dark Void.
11503000	11509000	Coming out from Capcom. There is also going to be a DSI game coming out as well for Dark Void.
11509000	11514000	That's being done in the 8-bit retro style. And it's going to be kind of a side-scroller game.
11514000	11518000	So that's going to be pretty awesome. That'll be out in January for five bucks.
11518000	11519000	It does look neat.
11519000	11524000	Aliens vs. Predators getting a special limited edition, including a face-hugger.
11524000	11526000	Yes, that's right. You get your own very...
11526000	11527000	I love you!
11527000	11530000	Your own alien that can hug your face.
11530000	11533000	And then finally, I just thought this was kind of strange.
11533000	11538000	Prinny is getting a sequel on the PSP, Prinny 2.
11538000	11545000	And it's about, apparently, you have to reclaim Aetna's stolen underwear.
11545000	11551000	Yes, the game is actually called Prinny 2 Dawn of the Great Pantsu War.
11551000	11554000	And that'll be out in Japan on March 25th.
11554000	11555000	Pantsu?
11555000	11556000	Yes.
11556000	11562000	That's all I had. Oh, and apparently, and I read this and just said,
11562000	11566000	Eh, that's stupid, but hey, I'll add it to the show roll.
11566000	11573000	Apparently, John Gosselin's Wii was stolen.
11573000	11579000	Who gives a shit about that douchebag?
11579000	11586000	Let him go to the cemetery of news people we just don't care about anymore.
11586000	11590000	He is no longer relevant. Bam. Done.
11590000	11593000	Who cares that he had a Wii that got stolen?
11593000	11594000	Well, sorry.
11594000	11599000	Sorry, there's also a free New Year's theme for Xbox Live, so you can download that.
11599000	11604000	Yippie skippy. But look, who cares about some a-hole in his Wii?
11604000	11606000	Just forget it.
11606000	11610000	Although I don't think people should steal things, even if the guy is a douchebag,
11610000	11612000	but now when you steal it, people just report on it.
11612000	11614000	So now you've done a double bad thing by stealing his Wii.
11614000	11616000	Rawr.
11616000	11620000	Anyhow, I don't mean to end this on a negative note, damn you, Loki.
11620000	11624000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
11624000	11626000	Loki, your final thought?
11626000	11632000	My final thought is I need to install more games on my main cabinet.
11632000	11636000	My final thought is I hope I get enough sleep, because I've got to go back to work tomorrow.
11636000	11638000	Boo.
11638000	11640000	DarkSahara, your final thought?
11640000	11643000	Uh...
11643000	11647000	I only have three words, Rob.
11647000	11649000	Reject false icons.
11649000	11651000	A very lovely thought to end on.
11651000	11653000	Guys, don't forget about Orange Launch Revolution's second mix,
11653000	11658000	the awesome tribute project that's out there that our fans put together.
11658000	11661000	All the information is available on OrangeLaunchReview.com,
11661000	11664000	as well as information on the OLR Madness,
11664000	11666000	what used to be the March Madness.
11666000	11670000	That event is going on right now, taking your top 25 picks of all time,
11670000	11672000	and we'll get into that more in future weeks
11672000	11676000	when we're not so focused on the weeks and the decades and so forth.
11676000	11678000	Check out all that on Orange Launch Radio.
11678000	11682000	Again, if you like the show, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.
11682000	11684000	Thank you guys so much.
11684000	11686000	Here we are 350 episodes later,
11686000	11690000	and we're looking forward to doing episode 351 next week.
11690000	11693000	So we'll be here same time next week to do it all over again,
11693000	11695000	right after Bobby Black Wolf.
11695000	11699000	Until then, have a great and safe new year,
11699000	11702000	and we will see you next decade.
