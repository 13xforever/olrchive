14138	18689	Tonight, December 27th, 2009, Pac-Man might soon fight at Battle Royale.
19010	21396	Could your portable games soon be banned on airplanes?
21737	22599	Can we take a look back
31380	36082	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36162	42506	We are live with our 350th episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 27th of 2009.
43466	44567	Yes, we're here for the holidays.
44927	49069	Broadcasting live every Sunday night, www.allgames.com.
49089	55813	We're an All Games Radio affiliate and we are very thankful that they let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night to do our little program.
56133	60035	Joining you over the next few hours, myself, Rob Roberts, and of course the one and only...
60595	61816	Jamie Summers, DarkSakura
87625	88145	Yes, it is.
88465	90186	I don't know why we're not hearing you at all tonight.
90586	94127	That's the wonders of live radio, is that sometimes you get technical difficulties, things happen.
94147	95787	Sometimes people play with my volume, apparently.
96168	96628	Apparently?
96668	97528	I don't know what's up with that.
98468	103370	I think what's going on is that behind our backs, DarkSakura has been secretly taping another show.
103390	103870	No!
103890	104210	Not at all.
104230	106471	And he's just screwing with some of the audio settings.
107171	108411	I didn't touch Loki's.
108531	110092	I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.
110192	110492	All right.
110632	111252	Try again, Loki.
111292	111952	I think we'll hear you now.
112152	112492	All right.
112892	113613	Oh, now we hear you too much.
113653	114153	No, it's really loud.
114193	114673	Yeah, we're good now.
116514	117214	How are you doing, Loki?
117234	117655	How was your week?
117795	118236	I'm alright.
118316	119036	Did you have a good holiday?
119797	120318	Yeah, sure.
120378	122360	Did Santa bring you lots of good stuff for the holidays?
124082	127606	Pots and stuff to do yard work.
127766	129368	Dude, Santa brought you pot?
130149	131650	No, like pots and pans.
131891	132251	Oh, I see.
133613	135134	It's in time for New Year's, Rob.
136476	136996	Amazing.
138240	139921	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
166881	170584	I also pre-ordered... I hate the word pre-order.
171325	176429	So I just ordered my copy in advance of Star Trek Online.
177850	184776	And apparently if you do the order through Amazon or through I guess any of the others, you'll get like a thing to do the beta.
186106	188188	So I'm going to be in the beta.
188288	189189	When's the beta start?
189229	189609	I can't remember.
189629	192651	There's so many like... January something, something-teenth.
192671	197295	Closed beta and open beta and retweet to get in the OMG right now betas.
197315	199576	There's so many betas going on.
199676	203859	I feel like I'm in the 80s all over again and VHS is just around the corner.
203879	205280	It's January something-teenth.
205701	205981	I see.
206141	206421	All right.
206561	206901	Thank you.
206921	207562	That's so helpful.
208282	212425	But I also got... Dan picked up for me...
214833	216297	Oh, by the way, it has to be the collector's edition.
217920	219023	Oh, for you to get the beta?
219223	219684	To get the beta.
219744	220206	I see, okay.
220226	220867	Which is what I got.
221108	222852	Which is what I imagine a lot of people are getting anyway.
223220	229946	And Dan picked up for me the Silent Hill game on Wii, so I need people to come over and hold my hand while I play it.
230426	234310	You know, I watched a friend play that game a couple days ago, and it was very strange.
234430	238173	I saw the nightmare sequence happen, and it's weird.
238373	241536	It doesn't get all rusty, it's just snowy in that game.
241856	247401	And it was just running through doors, over and over, running through doors, running through doors, running through doors, trying to avoid zombies.
247441	248162	I was like, this is...
248922	249903	You don't really run.
250303	255045	I mean, you do run in Silent Hill, but this felt like an action game or something.
255405	256365	It was strange.
256505	258226	I didn't play it, I watched.
258326	260667	It shatters your memories of Silent Hill.
260727	261448	How about that?
261488	263308	You have a bug about to crawl into your hair behind you.
265469	265909	Gross!
266430	266870	Gross!
267330	268511	Our studio's infested!
268591	269331	It is not infested.
269371	270671	Here's a tissue, you big baby.
272930	274671	There's bugs in our studio!
274911	277673	Oh my god, is that what you plan to end the decade with?
277733	278454	Killer bugs?
278554	279134	Destroy the host?
279154	280615	Rob, it probably snuck in through the window.
280655	281676	No, kill it, you big baby.
282556	285678	Hold on, I'm going to take a picture of it to show the listeners how big this scary bug is.
286299	286619	Fuck.
287740	288600	Make sure to zoom in.
288880	291242	Anything else for your gaming week, DarkSakura?
292503	295645	I played the game where I laugh about Rob being a big baby.
296005	297246	Shut up, it's a big scary bug.
297526	302429	We also played some Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, which was really good.
302589	305811	When I upload this to the feed, it's going to look like a big poop on your curtain.
307732	308872	Just kill it already, Rob.
308892	310193	Is it a pincher?
310313	310853	I'm going to kill it.
310914	311474	I don't know.
311554	312034	It better not.
312334	313715	If it pinches, I'm going to scream.
313915	315176	Oh, here.
315256	316397	Give me the napkin.
316437	317017	Hold my mic.
317197	318678	DarkSakura saves the day.
320439	322020	I should just let it do its thing.
323120	323260	Don't.
326253	327273	It's a scary bug!
329654	331535	But pinchers pinch, that's why they're called pinchers.
334496	339298	Well, now that our show has been sufficiently derailed for the decade, Loki, how was your gaming week?
339830	340290	It was alright.
340711	341511	Didn't play a whole lot.
341891	343993	I played more Grand Theft Auto this week.
344013	344934	You know, what little I could.
344954	345794	It went crunch.
346094	352359	And then I brought my 360 home hoping to play more stuff, but I just didn't because I ended up messing around with other things.
352879	358783	So I played a little bit of Little Big Planet, the new Pirates of the Caribbean water stuff.
360004	360524	It's neat.
360845	364567	Not as exciting as, you know, the Paintnator, but, you know, how can you top guns?
364687	365388	You just can't.
366449	367729	So it's pretty...
368530	368951	Thanks for watching!
379577	408908	I guess I did at some point so that's kind of neat but I was going to play also Mod Nation Racers and granted I did all this like an hour before the show so I meant to play Mod Nation Racers as well because I'm in the beta for that however since I haven't played LittleBigPlanet in forever I had to download the updates which took 15 minutes oh jeez yeah I can imagine so I was just you know what hey props to them because that means they have just been putting update after update after update on that game you know tons of updates yeah
409366	415630	I mean, I think the last time I downloaded the update was update 1.05, and they're up to 1.23 now.
416111	425917	It's a bummer, though, it's not smart enough to just go, okay, I'm going to download the patch that takes you from 1.05 all the way up to, without having to download five patches in between.
426378	427058	Something like that, yeah.
427418	429259	Sometimes PC games do that, especially MMOs.
430898	431078	Sonic!
447737	449099	Sonic, yes, perfect example.
451142	452764	And the Pirates of the Caribbean stuff's kind of neat.
453145	459353	The characters, obviously, they don't really have anything that looks too much like the stuff in the movie, but the same typical plot.
459373	462538	They have the two royal guards or whatever, the
463391	468033	Imperial Guards or whoever they are from the movie are in there and that kind of thing.
468574	472816	I only got to play the first level though before I wanted to move on to other things.
474337	476898	Then I actually played a little bit on the arcade cabinet.
477098	480520	I had a friend over and we were testing out my...
481500	491227	Newly souped up joysticks because I added octagonal restrictors in them now and also tighter springs.
491347	497351	I did everything except for take apart the actual push buttons to put the little paper in there and stuff.
497511	502795	Honestly, I just don't want to mess with that because I have a feeling it's going to fall apart after a while and it's enough.
503255	532161	so uh played Marvel vs. Capcom 1 and uh I'm not very good at it I like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 but I you know I couldn't figure out why I didn't have it yet and it's because I don't have any Naomi games yet and so that's what I basically spent most of the holiday doing was downloading Naomi games and downloading um you know Sega Model A games and you know Zinc Emulation games and all sorts of crap um
533217	534197	to put on the cabinet.
534958	539419	Oh, and CPS3 stuff, so I have Street Fighter 3 and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and all that fun stuff.
542000	543980	So anyways, actual game, though, I did play.
544020	547681	We played all the way through Simpsons, the arcade game on MAME, so that was fun.
547701	548962	I love playing through that.
548982	549322	Nice.
550002	554003	You know there's a Simpsons arcade on iPhone now, but it's not even the same thing.
554223	559445	It's just the same name, and I think it's definitely inspired by the old arcade game, but it's not...
559585	560765	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
582890	584253	It was fun.
584373	585535	I love playing the game.
585836	587198	We had a lot of fun playing it.
588160	588701	That was cool.
589322	590805	I'm trying to think of other stuff.
591006	592869	We were just trying a bunch of random games on there.
595369	622494	MissWorldNude96 didn't play that but the problem is, see right now I'm going through my list of games I have on there because there's a ton of games, first off clones that I have on there that I need to get rid of and I got rid of them on one list but I need to get rid of them on the list that's for my front end so that they don't display on there and then also a whole bunch of Mahjong games and crap I'm not going to play so I have to go through and delete all that stuff or stuff that just doesn't work um
623374	625816	You sound like me trying to organize my iTunes library.
647172	664920	a friend of mine inspired me to organize my iTunes a little better and I've been trying to do that and it is a mess like I have all these misspelled artists and albums and trying to get the right album art and things from compilations and it's a pain in the ass it sounds very similar just what you're describing is going through that whole process
665160	666821	Yeah, so it'll be nice when it's done.
666861	670203	Especially, I'm really excited to try some of these new Naomi games.
670243	672225	Because a lot of them don't necessarily work.
672245	677388	And you have one emulator for Naomi disc-based games and Dreamcast games.
677448	680050	And you have another emulator for Naomi cartridge games.
680470	682491	And some of those work and some of them don't.
684412	688715	Some of the ones that will work, though, like Ikaruga, Marvel vs. Capcom 2...
691308	693210	There's some I haven't even heard of before.
693711	696173	Like a lot of these really crazy shooter games.
696814	703381	Then, you know, just some of the normal ones like Senkei no Ronde or Rondo, I believe, in...
706830	709071	Radio Allergy or Radigy or whatever.
709911	713072	A lot of the cave shooters and stuff like that.
713592	715573	So that would be kind of cool to put in there.
715593	725056	Especially now that I have the heavy springs on the joysticks for really twitchy movements and stuff that will really come in handy for shooters and stuff.
725076	729497	So yeah, just lots of downloading stuff for the cabinet.
729697	732778	That's mainly what I've been doing during the break and a little bit
734266	735527	I still haven't played Borderlands.
735547	737429	I was like, I'm gonna play Borderlands this break!
737489	738169	I'm gonna do it!
739210	740011	I haven't done it yet.
740191	741733	And I even brought home, like, Bayonetta.
741753	743174	I was like, oh, I'm gonna play Bayonetta.
743534	746517	You know, I have, um... What was it?
746597	748679	Oto... Was it Otomedius?
748759	749259	Gorgeous.
749479	752842	The Konami shooter that has, like, chicks flying around.
752922	753843	I was gonna play that.
754023	754244	And, uh...
755663	756543	Just didn't get around to it.
784992	787994	What was it?
788014	790276	One of my friends actually did some testing for a while.
790697	793299	It's like, I'm so sick of playing soccer.
793619	794620	Testing or reviewing.
794660	797982	I mean, sometimes, you know, that, God, that's a discussion for a whole other show.
798002	799924	I was even trying to get into strategy guides.
800244	801605	I remember that, yeah.
802246	807770	And, like, they'll have you review, like, they'll just play through some of the most meh games, so.
808130	808390	Yeah.
808691	809651	I still want to do that, though.
810252	810612	You should.
810632	811193	It'd be fun.
811853	812554	Anyhow, sorry, Loki.
812574	813855	Anything else you wanted to say about your gaming week?
814888	816709	Um, that's basically it.
816789	824471	It's just lots of downloading stuff, and I'm sure none of that's legal because, you know, they're ROMs and, you know, whatever.
824891	825671	But, you know what?
826331	831333	I'm not going to go buy multi-thousand dollar worth of arcade boards.
832812	839715	Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on the show, and if you are listening live to us on All Games Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, head on over to our chat room.
840055	853861	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the easiest way to get there, or if you know your IRC, you just want to join the Game Surge Network on IRCGameSurge.net, and we are in Channel Pound Orange Lounge is the name of our chat room.
854641	859043	Anyhow, reading some comments from chat, it went all the way back up here, talking about...
860023	863224	I think Tigerclaw had said that it's appropriate.
863304	863565	Oh, yes.
863685	866786	What a way to start the last show of the new year or decade with a bug.
867366	868126	Going back to the bug.
868587	873689	Because you know how sometimes music will sometimes play when it's not supposed to here on the show.
873749	875109	And it's, whoops, live radio.
875430	875770	Shit.
877630	878651	It's the joys of live radio.
881188	882489	Also reading some comments from chat.
882989	887290	Ray Iannami in our chatroom says, PS, get your asses to SVGL, Sunnyvale Golf Land.
887570	889071	There is a Simpsons machine here.
889351	890031	You know what's interesting?
890351	893632	There is Simpsons machines kind of still out there all over.
893833	895193	I saw one randomly.
895233	897554	I was at this hotel near Disneyland staying.
897854	899594	They had a game room in the hotel.
899975	904896	I haven't seen a game room in a hotel that wasn't a casino since I was a teenager.
904916	906197	It's been a very long time.
906217	906797	Hello.
907137	913532	One of the first times we went to Disneyland, there was a hotel that we stayed in that had a game room and I'd go down there.
914383	915504	I wonder if it was the same hotel.
915524	916124	It might have been.
916284	916564	Maybe.
916604	916884	Who knows?
916904	917885	It was near the convention center.
917905	918205	Remember?
918225	919005	You probably don't even remember.
919025	920966	Well, the convention center wasn't built when I think.
920986	921226	Oh, yeah.
921246	921626	That's right.
921646	921927	That's right.
921967	922667	Well, anyhow.
923567	926569	But the Simpsons arcade game, obviously, a lot of people really remember this.
926849	929250	And it's still in arcades and probably still freaking makes money.
929590	933612	But, you know, this machine at this particular hotel, their game room was in pretty sad shape.
934472	935813	Like half the machines weren't working.
935873	938995	I think the Simpsons one was, but it was where the monitor was like...
940135	945041	So bright you could not like it's just faded over time, but it hasn't faded dark.
945081	945902	It's faded light.
945962	948925	I'm not sure what causes that maybe sun fading or something.
949085	950727	They probably in the dark room.
950767	954972	Well, it probably what happened was it burned in and they just turned the brightness up.
955592	956874	I see to try and avoid that.
957054	957334	I get it.
958255	960236	My gaming week, some of the things I played this week.
960576	962157	I did play a couple new games.
962557	966539	Obviously Steam is having an obscene sale right now as DarkSakura mentioned earlier.
966579	967259	She picked up Braid.
967619	971101	I picked up Luminous because the basic and advanced pack were on sale a couple days ago for $3.
972301	975623	So I was like, what the hell, I own Luminous on just about every other platform.
975643	976803	I'll get it on PC as well.
977163	978664	So that was cool.
978744	979644	It's the same game.
979984	982986	It certainly plays better than the iPhone one, although I still think...
983726	984786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1010475	1011676	Other stuff I played this week.
1012076	1015920	Saw a demo for a game called Crayon Physics, which was also on Steam.
1015960	1017102	It was interesting.
1017142	1024229	It was a very DS-inspired game because you would basically have this little ball on your screen that you had to get the ball to the star.
1024570	1026252	And you did that by drawing ramps.
1026812	1028074	Or it was kind of interesting.
1028134	1029095	You might have a little...
1030888	1031668	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1047496	1050939	But certainly, you know, not everybody owns a DS, but a lot of people own a PC.
1051059	1053480	So this is a way for you to get into those kinds of games.
1054001	1055942	I felt the game was a little basic.
1056823	1059305	And the music was kind of crack.
1059505	1064869	Like, it was really, like, trippy, scary almost, how happy trippy it was.
1064929	1066029	It was a little bit frightening.
1067090	1068131	Best description ever.
1068171	1068651	Happy trippy.
1068691	1068891	Thank you.
1068911	1069512	Happy trippy.
1069872	1070533	Look.
1070913	1074215	That's actually going to be 2DX 19th style or whatever they're up to now.
1074275	1074896	Happy trippy.
1074916	1074996	Yeah.
1077562	1104281	DarkSakura holds up the thumb hat as she's talking there so happy trippy thumb hat 2DX19 style let's see what other games did I play this week Tekken 6 I checked out for a little bit I have to admit my reaction to Tekken 6 after having spent a little time with it is lol what like that was honestly pretty much the reaction I had every few minutes we were playing Tekken 6 lol what
1105677	1109941	Dude is wearing pink pants and shoots electricity out of his hands while he's standing in water.
1110422	1111062	Lol what?
1112384	1118449	There's a giant transformer guy who shoots laser beams into the floor that makes me fall through and I instantly lose.
1118930	1119611	Lol what?
1121786	1127650	The Last Boss Looks Like Zombie, Big Bird, 8, like Raw from Stargate, and is glowing blue.
1128110	1130132	Lol what is this game?
1130272	1131333	Did we have any Voldo?
1133034	1134295	Mr. Bondage Crotch?
1134315	1136396	There's 40 fucking characters in the game.
1136476	1139698	And you know, Tekken has obviously been lol what for a little while.
1140459	1143361	It's had the panda bears and the kangaroos.
1143601	1146223	Voldo was so caliber, but I know that they brought in...
1146943	1148564	Like some of the really weird ones.
1148584	1151747	Well, of course, anything with Yoshimitsu in it's going to be... The training dummy.
1152387	1153808	Did you play as Panda?
1154408	1155269	I didn't play as Panda.
1155349	1158051	I played with my favorite tranny bitch, Anna Williams.
1158551	1162394	Because I'm telling you, in Tekken 6, she is one fierce transsexual.
1163075	1165036	No dis... Obviously, I mean no disrespect.
1165076	1171681	She just looks like your stereotypical, like, wearing all the leopard stuff and the boots and all that.
1171761	1175484	And she just... Like, literally, one of her moves... You know how everybody has a throw?
1175504	1175584	Yeah.
1176164	1176424	DarkSakura.com
1197375	1198596	Angel, Angel, Angel
1218394	1224857	from like 1981 where she's a prostitute by night and an FBI agent by day.
1225537	1227518	That's the best way I could describe Anna Williams.
1228818	1229119	I know.
1229259	1229779	Lol what?
1231219	1233340	So that was pretty much my review of Tekken 6.
1233440	1233900	Lol what?
1234241	1241744	Although I thought it was interesting that in certain parts of the game if you're playing offline mode it kind of simulates an online mode.
1242104	1247266	You'll be playing against people with these fake gamer tags that you're playing for promotions and
1247697	1249779	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1268700	1271741	The game is actually a lot more deep than I'm giving it credit for.
1271821	1276483	Keep in mind I only looked at a couple modes on this particular outing with the game.
1276863	1279705	Didn't really get too in-depth with the game, but yeah.
1279945	1280525	Lol, what?
1281625	1282326	That's pretty much it.
1283086	1287928	Also, AlphaCanadagram in chat says, Sky, it's ghost data of players.
1288348	1289629	That's kind of strange to me.
1290309	1291789	Like, are they actual real people?
1291829	1297472	Because I saw, like, at signs and other signs I didn't think you could have in your gamer tag as part of the...
1299141	1299722	What if I don't want my...
1315124	1316005	Ghost to be online.
1316546	1319909	Hitstun says, pretty cool, but they really only copy the user's combos.
1320169	1322411	Which really is what Tekken's all about.
1322851	1330558	There's not, you know, Tekken is not the fighting game with fireballs and, you know, all these insane moves.
1330858	1334041	Really, there's only low punch, high punch, low kick, high kick.
1334081	1336863	And those are pretty much all the buttons you use to do everything in Tekken.
1336903	1340046	And you just string all these combos and juggle, etc., etc.
1340587	1340707	So...
1342543	1347847	Alphacanatagram also adds in Tekken 6 has been in arcades for years, so they get data from arcade machines.
1347947	1348307	Okay.
1349108	1349608	Interesting.
1350128	1353931	I guess having that kind of come to light, obviously the game doesn't explain that to you.
1354211	1359475	I find that feature to be very interesting, but it doesn't really change my little what reaction to the game.
1360135	1361276	Anyhow, um...
1363257	1386330	Let's see, other games I played this week A lot of World of Warcraft still I already have a level 80 character I've had one for a couple years But now my new character I'm trying to get to 80 My paladin, my dwarf paladin She is level 78 Two bubbles away from 79 Very, very close to level 80 And I'm excited because I'll actually be able to use the new dungeon finder with that Hold on, I've got something for you guys Oh?
1387230	1388051	Alright, fill time
1389389	1391470	Well, I was going to actually mention something about this.
1392031	1397834	Speaking of Warcraft and all this stuff, I don't usually listen to other podcasts, and I've kind of talked about why on the show before.
1398154	1403557	I mean obviously I listen to Bobby Blackwolf because he's live before we are, and I listen to most of his show because of that.
1403597	1408760	But I don't want to inadvertently take ideas from other shows or what have you and all this other stuff.
1410321	1411022	Oh my gosh, thank you.
1412062	1413202	DarkSakura's handing out presents.
1413222	1413522	Yay!
1413702	1414682	Hold on, I'll open that in a minute.
1415223	1423204	But on Christmas Day, Scott Rubin, who's the ringleader of AllGames.com, if you weren't already aware, was doing like a marathon live show.
1423244	1425204	He was live for like five or six hours that day.
1425744	1428085	And I actually called him and talked to him for a little while.
1428105	1428625	It was pretty cool.
1428845	1431465	I'm pretty sure it'll be archived on AllGamesRadio's site.
1432185	1432826	You can check that out.
1433126	1435046	We talked a long time about digital distribution.
1435086	1436846	I think he's very pro-digital distribution.
1437946	1439467	We had a little lively debate about that.
1441107	1464513	but I tuned in later on the iPhone app in my car because I was driving to San Francisco Christmas night and I wanted to listen to more like talk radio I thought would be good for the drive but he wasn't on anymore instead this other program was on uh talking about nothing but World of Warcraft and uh it's called the Warcraft Outsiders which I think is a spin-off of Video Game Outsiders another um all games radio program on the network I have to say you know I
1465033	1468235	As much as I don't often listen to other podcasts, I thought they did a pretty good job.
1468836	1473119	They knew their stuff talking about Warcraft, and I thought it was interesting.
1473559	1479723	Since I play the game all the time, I wasn't hearing a lot of news that I didn't already know, but I kind of liked hearing about their experiences.
1480523	1486107	The gal they have on that show, I think her name is Michelle, was kind of like the ringleader of that show, at least the particular episode I was listening to.
1486807	1488328	She knows her shit on Warcraft.
1488388	1488609	I was...
1489309	1489989	Very impressed.
1490569	1492730	She's a pretty hardcore raider and all that stuff.
1494130	1505013	It was a good show, so I wanted to give them a shout out because we don't often give the other all games radio shows enough shout outs here, but we are all about supporting other independent radio and independent podcasts.
1505053	1508935	Just because I say I personally don't listen to a lot of other podcasts doesn't mean you shouldn't.
1509695	1512496	You should go out there and support all the other podcasts out there.
1513216	1517177	Especially if you decide Orange Lounge Radio is not your cup of tea, I bet there is another show on the network.
1517737	1519759	It is their cup of tea, so check that out.
1522762	1523202	Now.
1523522	1523882	Now what?
1524403	1525064	Open present?
1525124	1526325	Me first or Loki first?
1528066	1529808	You've got your card, so go ahead.
1529908	1530749	La la la card.
1532910	1533371	Crap.
1535132	1538936	It's a card and on the tree it says, wow, those are some really big balls.
1539056	1540017	And the guy says, thanks.
1540697	1543360	And it says, have a great big Merry Christmas.
1545916	1546156	Get it?
1546176	1547517	The tree had big balls on it.
1547917	1549438	I just fucked up my little hat.
1549918	1551139	Now I'm going to open up this box.
1551179	1551899	I don't want to ruin it.
1553200	1554020	It's a box, Rob.
1554060	1555221	It costs a dollar.
1555241	1556421	This is terrible radio, though.
1557382	1557642	Hold on.
1557682	1558762	I'm opening a box, folks.
1563104	1564245	No, it's not a dick in a box.
1564345	1564785	Oh, snap.
1565846	1568727	It is a... Oh, cool!
1568807	1571208	World of Warcraft Year of Here.
1571308	1571849	It's like a...
1572714	1581437	A 365 day calendar, I'm assuming Like a desk calendar That shows little locales in the world of Warcraft I will totally take this to work and they'll really think I'm a freak It'll be awesome
1582148	1582968	That's why I bought it.
1583449	1584069	Great, that's cool.
1584089	1585090	For people to think you're a freak.
1585330	1589352	Like on Tuesday, the 26th of January, there's a little picture of the Violet Hold.
1590292	1593474	On Thursday, the 8th of July, there's a picture of Icecrown Citadel.
1593494	1596015	They just have all these little pictures from around Warcraft.
1596035	1596575	That's kind of neat.
1596755	1598256	Yeah, I saw it and I thought you'd appreciate it.
1598276	1599216	There's a vast world in Warcraft.
1599236	1600357	That's one of the reasons to play.
1600857	1601357	Pretty awesome.
1601598	1601858	Loki.
1601998	1602798	Open your box, Loki.
1604119	1604379	Do it.
1604579	1605599	My card says bacon.
1605640	1606300	How'd you know?
1607861	1610602	And it's a dog jumping up and down because he got a box full of bacon.
1613120	1615081	Hope you get just what you're looking for this Christmas.
1615221	1615761	Is that what you got?
1615821	1616561	A box full of bacon?
1616681	1617601	Well, I don't know.
1617641	1618441	Open your box!
1618782	1620022	What's in the box?
1620082	1621022	What's in the box?
1621222	1621642	Do it!
1622983	1625543	What's in the fucking box?
1625683	1626704	Tell me what's in the box!
1629464	1631265	Loki's opening his box very slowly.
1632885	1635446	So, Rob, did you see the thing that I posted on Facebook earlier?
1635906	1637006	The 30 seconds of...
1640754	1641274	of Lich King.
1641294	1645995	I got the Worst Case Scenario Daily Survival Calendar 2010.
1646455	1646715	Nice.
1647276	1651337	Day-to-day guide to surviving a year's worth of peril.
1651677	1655518	Isn't this what inspired your old advice column you used to do?
1655598	1663500	Yes, I used to have this calendar a few years ago and I remember just cracking up on a daily basis and I figured that, look, you would appreciate some advice.
1663580	1666520	Like, how to deliver a baby in a mall.
1667080	1667500	Very nice.
1668141	1669441	How to control a runaway camel.
1670782	1672490	How to navigate a minefield successfully.
1673800	1675421	and How to Drive Santa's Sleigh.
1675862	1690772	If you can find some old ass episodes of our To Go show, which I think was around 2005, 2006, when we first were getting into podcasting, we would do like a three to four hour live show, then record another hour that was separately podcast.
1690812	1694235	We merged the shows finally, got smart and merged them together finally a couple years later.
1694555	1700680	But if you can find some old episodes of the To Go show, it was really funny because DarkSakura had these little advice columns that were like,
1701841	1705704	They have some pretty appropriate stuff, like for example, New Year's Day.
1707285	1710908	It's essential survivor knowledge, appropriate attire for winter weather.
1711769	1713670	Really, this should be the date before.
1713950	1715672	How to carry someone who is passed out.
1718034	1718634	Very useful.
1719775	1724619	I freaking love worst case scenario, so I thought that maybe Loki would too.
1724879	1728242	How to deflect encounter or sword blow.
1729471	1733812	Well, it was either that or I was trying to decide who I was going to give the bitch a day calendar to.
1733832	1739513	Does it actually have 365 bitches on it or is it like complaints?
1740613	1751516	It's like those magnets that you have the one that says remember when fat butts were in style or the I'm having screaming PMS with a really happy looking 40s chick on there.
1752576	1753756	You know, that type of thing.
1753796	1755256	It was all stuff like that.
1755597	1757417	How to land a runway hire balloon.
1759082	1759543	Just in case.
1759563	1760303	You never know, Loki.
1760323	1760844	You never know.
1760864	1761224	Might need it.
1762806	1766389	Ranma in chat is bragging he has all of the OLR2GO podcast.
1766629	1768371	I thought there was an archive online somewhere.
1768651	1771995	And I know there's like – and DarkTetsuya is talking about the descriptions on the wiki.
1772255	1779382	And I haven't talked about this a lot on the show, but on wikia.com, there's actually a whole Orange Lounge Radio wiki that you can look up.
1779442	1780983	And it actually has like descriptions of –
1781804	1782425	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1801462	1802943	Who's the baby on your screen right now on Facebook?
1802963	1805324	That's our friend Megumi's baby, Luke.
1805344	1806765	Aww, that's cute.
1806985	1814970	He's cute, and it was great radio, but... Although that reaction is somewhat like, did you ever see Batboy on the World News cover?
1815371	1815571	No.
1816271	1816812	With the face?
1817092	1818873	That's just a cute little baby yawn.
1821536	1821816	All right.
1822256	1825297	Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1825357	1827638	Of course, we're on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1827678	1830759	We also have a Facebook now, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1831080	1832580	You should definitely follow us on those sites.
1833080	1837982	And we will still be here live next Sunday and the Sunday after.
1838182	1845005	I do not know yet what the plan is for the show on January the – I'm looking at my calendar here – January the 17th.
1846065	1849068	I hear there's a best of in the works, so maybe that'll finally be ready by that week.
1849088	1849328	I'm not sure.
1863581	1865162	Loki, start us off tonight with some news.
1887963	1896846	Capcom has decided to pull a few games from their Quarter 1 2010 lineup, including Super Street Fighter 4, Lost Planet 2, and Monster Hunter Tri.
1899986	1904968	And from what I've seen, they haven't really announced yet when they're going to...
1905928	1907290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1927426	1956493	and they said they're planning on spreading them across all four quarters which makes sense if you think about it because Capcom usually front loads the first part of the year with their games and I'm sure that a lot of the stuff that they put out ends up competing with itself so it kind of makes sense that you would want to spread that out and they still do have some stuff coming out in the first quarter they have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Ultimate All-Stars and of course Dark Void coming out as well and that's not even including the
1957373	1963178	Other things that they're planning on releasing digital distribution-wise, including Mega Man 10.
1963979	1966160	A lot of stuff coming out still.
1966501	1970764	It's still a little bit disappointing, though, because when I read the article, what you say makes a lot of sense.
1970824	1975588	They don't want to load the year too front-heavy, I guess, for lack of a better term.
1975948	1981773	But there were some big, like Super Street Fighter 4, I had the feeling we were going to be playing it come February or March.
1981793	1982474	I still think we may.
1982534	1984816	I still think it may come out in April or May, not
1985476	1990879	Dead Rising 2 is still at some point, but they have a pretty big slate of games coming up this year.
1990919	1991359	It's just...
2006484	2009105	Not putting them all out at the same time Lots of games got delayed
2035478	2045147	Well, a lot of it's because of Modern Warfare 2, and a lot of people were afraid to kind of take on Modern Warfare 2, and so they've delayed their games to other parts of the year, which is fine, because I think that's good.
2045847	2053034	Normally, we get these really dead months where there's nothing coming out, and I'm like, you know, hey, it'd be the perfect time to put this game out, because there's really nothing competing with it right now.
2053354	2056717	Like, April, I mean, most of April's gonna be pretty dead.
2056737	2058579	I mean, you're gonna have Red Dead Redemption on the 27th, but...
2060222	2062683	As far as I'm aware, there's normally not much coming out in April.
2062743	2064004	It's pretty dead.
2064244	2066785	Isn't that kind of traditional, though, that not much comes out around that time?
2066805	2070787	Because that's when you're starting to get into finals and college, which is your big gaming base.
2071067	2072528	They don't care about that kind of stuff, though.
2072548	2074329	You don't think that kind of stuff cuts into sales?
2074349	2075469	No, I don't think it really matters.
2075669	2077090	I think it's just development cycles.
2077170	2081372	And really, a lot of the stuff, they try to push it out before the end of March.
2081612	2082172	Wait a minute.
2082192	2083553	Isn't Final Fantasy XIII April?
2083693	2084233	Or is that March?
2084413	2084934	That's March.
2085034	2085574	Okay, my bad.
2086365	2101700	Final Fantasy XIII is the beginning of March, but that may be another reason too why some of these delays are happening, because if they're coming out around the same time as Final Fantasy XIII, maybe that's another... It's not as big as Modern Warfare 2, but it's going to be pretty big.
2101920	2103562	And it's a completely different audience, you know what I mean?
2103602	2108188	Like, the kind of people that play Final Fantasy XIII aren't going to play these other types of games.
2108569	2110211	Or, well, you know, there's always somebody that plays both.
2110231	2112914	Well, Monster Hunter, I think, kind of, you know, it's a little similar.
2113295	2115237	Okay, I could see that kind of having some similar crossover.
2115257	2117440	Street Fighter, yeah, not much of a crossover there.
2117540	2118842	But still, though, it's, you know...
2119082	2122163	It's a very similar strategy to how they do movies, right?
2144013	2144733	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2169847	2173788	Yet, or it has been announced, I'm kind of surprised there.
2173808	2177449	I would have thought maybe Crackdown 2 might be coming out.
2177989	2184391	Or hey, even, you know, maybe, what was it?
2186432	2187572	I can't remember the name of the game now.
2187712	2189632	Oh, that's all right, because I'm not buying it.
2190713	2192573	The other Microsoft, Alan Wake, that's right.
2192933	2195814	The one that's been delayed forever, you know.
2196234	2197254	It probably won't be that great.
2197995	2198695	Well, it looks all right.
2202285	2204788	I guess it's good that they're delaying stuff just a little bit.
2205068	2210936	It kind of sucks because they have to lower their projections for how they're going to finish up their 2010 financial year, but
2214306	2215006	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2234739	2248694	and um you know I don't think this year is going to be different obviously we're going to have another Call of Duty game and some more Guitar Hero games and some more DJ Hero and who knows what hmm
2250243	2253566	It's definitely going to be a busy year next year, but then I wonder how much we're going to hear next year.
2253666	2255568	Delayed again, delayed again, lololol.
2255588	2257889	There's going to be a lot of stuff that's delayed.
2257909	2260992	Natal delayed, Sony Motion delayed, hahaha.
2261252	2271941	That's the other thing too, there's a lot of that stuff coming out, you know, kind of in the, I want to say it was supposed to be the second quarter, and maybe some of these games are going to use some of that.
2272001	2276765	Maybe they're delaying it because of that, or maybe they're going to delay them to add that kind of stuff, or maybe...
2278084	2279185	Pac-Man Battle Royale
2295936	2297317	Don't know what the heck that could be.
2297357	2299659	Could that be a fighting game involving Pac-Man?
2320838	2321798	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2341525	2342166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2357742	2359043	We had a bunch of copies of it.
2380836	2383298	I don't remember how, maybe a chatter remembers this better.
2383699	2386241	We had a stack of them and we're giving them out.
2386301	2387802	Yeah, but you had to get a copy of it somehow.
2389463	2393167	You probably had that because of Game Store connections, but there was a way you were supposed to get it.
2393187	2395008	I don't know if it was like a pre-order bonus or what.
2395288	2396049	I think it was.
2396129	2396770	I think it was too.
2399463	2413571	Anyhow, who knows what this game could be all about, but of course when I hear Pac-Man Battle Royale, I don't know about you guys, but I think about the old Japanese movie where they might strand Pac-Man on a desert island with his peers and give him only a fan to survive.
2415012	2415592	Paper plate.
2417113	2420455	That would be pretty amazing if that was actually the case, but I somehow doubt that.
2420715	2422216	Hey, I've won Paper Plate Battle Royale.
2422296	2425177	I just can't see an M-rated Pac-Man game for the life of me.
2425497	2425637	No.
2425658	2426438	Although it would be funny.
2427719	2432621	Well, how about something that is a little bit more on the mature level, even if it's not M-rated?
2433582	2441646	My single favorite Castlevania game ever, Dracula X Rondo of Blood, is coming to Virtual Console!
2442526	2443427	It's about damn time!
2444007	2445548	But, um, guess where?
2446909	2447389	Australia.
2447989	2449330	Hence my comment before the show.
2451213	2479644	which only they heard if you're live tonight but that's alright which is very interesting because Australia has been getting a lot of bad news lately as far as video games go so this is kind of interesting the OLFC actually has a rating up for as it's titled Castlevania Rondo of Blood for virtual console release I hope that we get it over here but I don't know
2481537	2482437	It's such a fun game.
2482477	2489101	I mean, I hate having to break out the PC Engine every time I want to play it or try to find the PSP version.
2490082	2492423	Honestly, I still prefer the PC Engine version over the PSP.
2492844	2497727	If this game were to come out on Virtual Console, wouldn't it be the first PC Engine CD game to do so?
2498067	2500868	Didn't we get Ys?
2501489	2501729	No.
2502469	2506512	I'm sorry, I've got Ys Book 1 and 2 on CD.
2506812	2507212	I can't.
2507232	2507653	Valus...
2508673	2509434	I can't remember.
2509454	2510956	There's so many games on Virtual Console now.
2510976	2511818	I'd have to look at the list.
2511858	2513760	I think Ys has been revived on the DS.
2514101	2514301	Yeah.
2514321	2519608	Like, I know there's been some newer games there, or PSP, but I don't think the originals ever came to Virtual Console.
2519648	2520269	I could be wrong.
2520449	2521410	Somebody in chat might correct us.
2521431	2521931	We'll have to check.
2521951	2523033	I don't think the originals ever did.
2523914	2525436	Hey, chatters, do our dirty work for us.
2525456	2526097	Go check.
2526457	2527498	If Konami still loves us Why Australia first?
2548359	2550700	Well, it could just be that maybe that's where the news is leaked.
2550860	2554281	Maybe it's really planned for everywhere, but the news has just happened to leak for Australia.
2554541	2554981	Possibly.
2555101	2559542	Maybe they had to put in their request for rating some earlier date.
2559642	2563444	Right, and these ratings requests are how game announcements leak all the freaking time.
2563464	2573607	They've tried to take measures to stop that here with the ESRB and the States, but that doesn't change Australia, Europe, and some of the other countries where we get our titles spoiled from.
2575927	2577308	Well, you know, I'll have that in an instant.
2578038	2579899	I know, I will actually check that out too.
2580760	2584982	Be finally a way I can actually play this game because I didn't collect all these systems that DarkSakura did.
2585042	2586343	I told you to come over and play it.
2586863	2588724	I know, but it would be nice to have it in my own house.
2588784	2592246	I mean, not that I don't enjoy spending time with DarkSakura, but it would be nice to fire it up whenever I want.
2592306	2593907	If I want to play at 2 a.m., I don't have to call you.
2594288	2594688	Wednesday.
2596289	2597409	I don't know yet.
2597490	2599591	I might actually have that day off work, so I'll let you know.
2600551	2600852	Super.
2601432	2601792	The end.
2602653	2602793	Yeah.
2604858	2610862	So Namco, they've got a lot of great games out there and some of those you may have missed.
2611363	2612964	And some crappy ones too, just for the record.
2613004	2616166	Some crappy ones you may have missed and may not want to play.
2616427	2617808	Would you really miss them if they're crappy?
2618897	2622359	You may just want to collect the achievements and or trophies.
2639907	2642288	Beautiful Katamari, sometime in the first quarter of 2010.
2642608	2647709	And then on the PlayStation Portable, me and my Katamari on December 22nd.
2647829	2650510	So it's already out there if you want to snag that.
2651391	2661114	And of course, you know, that being said, they're also planning on putting out other PlayStation 1 and PSP catalog titles as well on the PlayStation Network.
2661854	2661994	And...
2663829	2670533	There also may be other titles coming to the Xbox 360 as well, but they haven't really named names yet.
2672094	2672895	That's kind of neat, though.
2673075	2673855	More Katamari.
2674216	2678078	Yeah, but that was the worst Katamari game in the series.
2678158	2680560	Both of those ones you named were the low points of the series.
2680900	2683041	Personally, I did not enjoy Beautiful Katamari.
2683361	2688645	I have friends that say I'm totally not being fair to that game and so forth.
2690191	2700696	and maybe they think there's a grudge because of the history our show has with that particular title but no, I think really you put that side by side with Katamari Forever on the PS3 and it is staying no contest.
2700716	2701596	The PS3 one's better.
2702416	2706158	Even though the PS3 one is a rehash of some of the old stuff, I still say the PS3 one's better.
2706738	2717903	And just wait for the PS3 one to drop down in price because it will pretty quick because it'll kind of fade off pretty fast and you probably will be able to pick up the new Katamari game um
2719229	2728112	for $20 or something, and that's about what you're going to pay for these re-releases, so just be patient.
2729181	2733464	Very interesting how digital distribution is kind of best known for this year.
2733905	2738628	Breathing new life into games that had slipped off the radar, which is exactly what Namco is doing here.
2738908	2748396	But I compare this to, you know how Steam is doing their epic sale right now, where, I swear, they undercut this shit down to cost just to get people in the door.
2748656	2750297	They might even be taking losses on it.
2750337	2755161	I don't know what they're doing, but they're just trying to get as many Steam subscribers as they can.
2755601	2757362	But, I mean, some of the games they're selling...
2758183	2760644	would have fallen off the radar a long time ago.
2760744	2770090	For example, I think they were selling the LucasArts pack for like three bucks, which was the Indiana Jones games and Loom and all that was on sale for three bucks the other day.
2771170	2782476	Well, you know, yeah, that might be a steal, but at the same time for the publisher and all the salespeople involved, that's three bucks they probably weren't going to get because these games are so freaking old.
2782857	2783917	Who buys them anymore?
2784538	2786559	But digital distribution kind of opens it all up.
2787557	2788198	XBOX Live Marketplace
2812239	2815741	Guitar Hero World Tour, Band Hero, Lips, Lips No.
2815761	2819223	1 Hits, Lego Rock Band, Beatles Rock Band, whatever rock band there is.
2820044	2825627	They all have these special front-end stores where you can actually sample music tracks and download the songs.
2825647	2827669	You might be thinking, well, I can already do that in the game.
2827949	2837615	Yeah, you can, but now you can also do it through the Xbox 360 interface, which is kind of cool that you don't have to go find the disc to put it in the drive to sample the latest releases.
2837875	2838515	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2858328	2869292	If you remember from E3, though, a couple years ago, they said that that was one of the things that they wanted to do to begin with was offer the multimedia interaction with the games.
2871133	2871753	So there you go.
2873854	2885918	Yeah, so I have not checked out that storefront myself, but I'm looking at some of the screenshots, and it definitely seems... It's nice that every game kind of gets its own little look and logo and so forth, but where's Rock Revolution?
2887333	2887813	Just kidding.
2888234	2888654	I don't care.
2889436	2891198	Where's the dedicated store?
2891218	2892400	Oh yeah, in the clearance bin.
2892420	2893081	That's where it is.
2895544	2893081	$4.99.
2895684	2898668	Xbox Live should have its own little clearance bin of sorts.
2899565	2900465	Here's our dumpster.
2900565	2901586	I mean, clearance bin.
2901626	2903086	It kind of looks like Borderlands.
2903406	2904746	It's like just this wasteland.
2904786	2906187	I've got a great idea for Microsoft.
2906207	2906487	What's that?
2906507	2916470	You can do something similar to that with Project Natal, where you actually dig through the clearance bin with your hands, making different gestures using the Natal camera.
2916490	2919991	So you can find the Rock Revolution in there for $4.99.
2920051	2920171	Nice.
2920231	2923672	Yeah, no one would ever get it.
2925612	2928213	So how about some news about a game no one cares about?
2929228	2929932	Champions Online!
2933926	2942092	Actually, there is going to be a new update and an iPhone app and a recruitment initiative.
2942112	2945415	Please play our game.
2945735	2947136	I know, right?
2947437	2958846	There is Champion's Companion for the iPhone, which you can use to review your character and see your online status, check your friends list, your mail, read news.
2958946	2959327	It's free.
2959967	2960808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2979868	2982250	So I guess that's kind of okay.
2982751	2992942	And then they did an Attack of the Misfit Toys event over the weekend with new costume pieces, action figures, perks, that type of stuff.
2992962	2994323	Please come play our game.
2994383	2995084	I know, right?
2995204	2996506	We need people.
2999049	3003856	I think we had a story just like this a couple weeks ago, but it was Age of Conan.
3003916	3004897	Very similar type of thing.
3005037	3007862	They're practically giving the game away to get people to play it.
3007882	3010906	They already know where it's going to come in, and that's going to be with Star Trek.
3011347	3011467	So...
3013339	3015140	That's what I'm holding out for.
3015600	3019282	Ironically enough, isn't that what got a lot of people to sign up for Champions Online in the first place?
3019322	3022223	Was guaranteed access to Star Trek Online's beta or something like that?
3022724	3027986	I remember if you got an Uber subscription to Champions, you could play Star Trek Online early or something.
3028486	3030087	You know what, that wins the whatever award.
3030167	3031528	That should have been a warning sign right there.
3031608	3034029	Because I'm already getting a beta, so...
3035090	3039134	Our chatroom's actually lighting up with comments on the last story because we're a little bit behind.
3039154	3043037	It takes time for what we say to encode and you guys to hear it through the All Games feed and so forth.
3043057	3046960	They're still talking about Rock Revolution a little bit because I was giving a little shit in chat earlier.
3047320	3051844	Ranma in chat says, Sorry, Rock Revolution was well worth the $5 I paid for it.
3052484	3056407	Brad from PodCulture asks, What sucked more, Rock Revolution or Yaris?
3056948	3059150	To be fair, Yaris probably sucked more.
3059570	3062472	Yaris, but for your suck-to-money value...
3065137	3065918	Yaris is free.
3095240	3098942	Not that difficult to make a successful music game, Konami.
3099102	3100582	I mean, you've done it in the past.
3100602	3102163	You just kind of have to copy what you did.
3102243	3103703	But somehow you just fuck it up.
3104324	3105444	And I don't know how you do that.
3105704	3108265	It's like, ah, they won't get it over in America.
3108345	3110086	Let's make it all ghetto looking.
3110606	3111647	Yeah, that's awesome.
3111667	3114108	Way to shit on your fans.
3115888	3117789	And trust me, we're not into that over here.
3118209	3118989	That's other countries.
3119810	3119970	Yep.
3120891	3123975	All right, we're going to travel around the world and look at some release dates.
3124035	3125857	Hopefully some good things coming out soon.
3125917	3129221	Although, then again, it's that time of year where probably there ain't shit coming out.
3129521	3130042	I don't know, Loki.
3130082	3130963	Is that the story here?
3131493	3132874	I'm pretty sure that's correct.
3132914	3134274	There is nothing coming out.
3134894	3138436	And at least last I checked, there was nothing coming out.
3138856	3141637	And if there is anything coming out this week, it's probably crap.
3142397	3147239	But I mean, I guess if you count Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, the Crystal Bears came out today.
3148399	3150480	So that's something, I guess.
3151621	3157403	And supposedly this week, Divinity 2 Ego Draconis is supposed to be coming out on PC and Xbox 360.
3157743	3160824	I thought that was supposed to be next week, but hey.
3162293	3163273	Dreamer, Zookeeper, World Party Games
3188698	3190159	Really, it's the same story in Japan.
3190279	3191920	Literally not a damn thing coming out.
3192000	3193641	It's very quiet over there right now.
3194282	3199125	A price reduction on Tactics A2 on the DS is about all you got going for you.
3200385	3205608	Honestly, there's really not a lot to look forward to until January 9th when Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep hits the Sony PSP.
3205949	3207970	That's probably the next big, big release over in Japan.
3208730	3211172	Yeah, I didn't find a damn thing for Europe.
3211192	3211492	Sorry.
3212423	3214945	It's just that time of year, folks, but we talk about them every week.
3215025	3219268	So this is a good week to go back and play the games you missed this year in 2009, yes?
3219408	3219989	Pretty much.
3220129	3220549	Pretty much.
3220689	3221089	Pretty much.
3221310	3222410	All right, so back to some news then.
3222611	3222791	Yes.
3223851	3235580	So soon, and I'm not sure if this is actually going to happen because I could think a lot of other people would be pissed off for other reasons, but pretty soon you may not be able to play your PSP or DS on airplanes.
3236641	3239243	Apparently somebody is trying to...
3241124	3242086	and DarkSakura.com
3254864	3259666	Apparently, there is a guy, Omar... I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name.
3259706	3266129	Anyways, the guy was arrested after failing to ignite an explosive device on Christmas Day on a plane.
3266209	3268009	Oh, God, I heard about that on CNN.
3268069	3269970	So that had to do with electronic devices?
3270410	3270651	Yes.
3270991	3273912	Apparently... Let's see...
3274652	3276832	One motherfucker always ruins it for everybody else.
3277813	3284834	You know how you can't take in water over a certain size, and your shampoo has to be in a clear bottle and in a plastic bag?
3285334	3285994	I'm not mad.
3286034	3297597	I understand that they're doing it for our safety and what have you, but it's because some asshole threatened to use it as a bomb and said that you could use water as a... It's just frustrating.
3297757	3298837	Apparently, yeah, he...
3300763	3301864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3320716	3331239	Full-bag searches were instigated at the boarding gates, and the ban on electronic devices is said to be a reaction to his ability to smuggle an explosive onto the plane.
3332019	3341642	This would, of course, mean any DS or PSP would be banned, as well as anything from...
3342362	3346067	Electronic Books, iPods, cell phones, other gaming devices, etc.
3346147	3348550	It's going to make flight so incredibly boring.
3348650	3349692	It's not going to fly.
3349712	3350092	Pun intended.
3352950	3362714	I, you know, honestly, I'm surprised he was able to do that, because, I mean, they scan all that stuff through, you know... Well, he was on an international flight.
3362754	3363974	He didn't get screened at a U.S.
3364014	3364394	airport.
3364474	3365895	He got screened at a Dutch airport.
3366035	3371157	Not to... I don't know what they do over there that's different than what they do over here, but he didn't get in the U.S.
3371257	3372077	You have a bomb.
3372337	3372497	No.
3372737	3373558	Okay, you may go.
3376399	3376659	You know...
3378424	3381805	I really don't see them banning all electronics on planes.
3381845	3382725	I think that's a bit much.
3383065	3392648	And it's going to suck because I know a lot of airlines are looking into, like, I think Virgin Air, one of them, if they're not already doing it, was looking into, like, free Wi-Fi on flights now.
3392688	3397189	Like, that's what the technology's gotten, is you can get on the internet on flights, which is pretty amazing.
3397510	3399470	And it would really suck to kind of rip that all away.
3399870	3402011	But at the end of the day, if there is a true...
3402731	3407735	Threat, I suppose, for lack of a better term, to, you know, electronic devices on planes.
3407935	3411058	Something that they can't screen for at the airport for God knows whatever reason.
3411098	3411898	Here's something.
3411978	3412759	Safety first.
3412919	3416402	People didn't have laptops 20 years ago, 30 years ago.
3416842	3418203	Flights will still work, you know.
3418423	3423387	Well, what if some dude was to create an EMP bomb using electronic devices?
3424989	3427050	Can't detect that because it's not an explosive.
3427190	3428091	The plane would go down.
3428551	3429032	Exactly.
3429372	3429972	But that's the point.
3429992	3431874	They wanted to explode or, you know.
3433424	3435405	Someone's probably thought of that.
3435425	3436485	They have something.
3436865	3439046	They don't advertise all their countermeasures.
3439286	3440867	I mean, for obvious reasons.
3441287	3450170	First of all, if anyone was going to actually be able to project an EMP that would make a plane go down, it'd be a bigger device.
3450850	3452471	It wouldn't be something that could be hidden that easily.
3454031	3454392	I don't know.
3454432	3456232	I'm just playing devil's advocate.
3456612	3457193	No, I know.
3457293	3460794	It's just... Although that really would be about the only thing I could think of.
3462026	3466690	SSJ100 Matt wants to add, Rob, he hid firecrackers in his crotch.
3467191	3471214	The Dutch screeners scanned him, but they wouldn't have found them unless they patted him down.
3471534	3473616	That seems so odd to me.
3474737	3476559	How many did he have in his crotch?
3477360	3480763	Maybe it was one of those things where it only takes a spark to ignite...
3481920	3498074	If you have something flammable I don't know Obviously they're not telling you the details On what he was planning to do for obvious reasons But I still find it shocking That he was able to hide firecrackers Undetected You know It sucks
3500069	3502331	Electronic Gaming Monthly is coming back!
3524628	3530871	It's going to be coming back with an April issue that's released in March because, you know, they come out a month before the actual date on the magazine.
3531571	3532492	And that's when it's coming out.
3534393	3537354	There's a press release that came out that announced that it will be coming out.
3537534	3541216	And there's also going to be an EGMI, the digital magazine.
3541776	3550200	I guess there's a special code that will be in the issue that allows you to access the digital components for exclusive article extensions and original content.
3550560	3553842	So trying to get you to buy the, you know, trying to tie it into the Internet.
3554102	3554743	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3581058	3582379	A little silly, but I don't know.
3582519	3584261	Features and things, I suppose.
3584321	3595611	Anyone that doesn't have a subscription to Gameformer, and pretty much if you shop at GameStop and you have one of their cards, you have a subscription because you get it for free when you get their stupid card.
3596112	3599775	Anyways, the online portion of it is kind of useless.
3600036	3604540	They have some additional screenshots, usually, or some...
3606391	3608013	I miss the old magazines with demo discs.
3627386	3627927	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3640882	3644385	Now, occasionally, though, they did have some free download content in there, which is kind of cool.
3644405	3646887	They had a few Oblivion expansions and stuff like that were free.
3647247	3648088	So that's kind of cool.
3648108	3649069	That's a little bit of a value.
3649129	3653752	But, you know, I'm kind of missing the days, like, well, you know, I used to buy PC Gamer, too.
3653812	3656154	They used to have a whole bunch of shareware and free shit on there.
3656274	3661779	Well, wouldn't it now just be type in the code and get a demo on PSN or Xbox Live?
3661899	3662459	Yeah, they could do that.
3662479	3664401	I mean, why bother with the cost of discs now?
3664721	3665142	It's all digital.
3665162	3665282	Yeah.
3665782	3666783	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3696300	3709244	So if you want to pick up your bathroom reader of Electronic Gaming Monthly, it will feature stuff by Dan, Shu, Sue, Sean Baby is part of the crew as well, and so on and so on.
3709704	3711604	A lot of names you probably recognize from previous years.
3711624	3713825	Oh, he did the comic, the Sue and Sean comic.
3714365	3716266	I used to read those like all the time.
3717426	3719167	And they had a webcomic I think for a little while too.
3720967	3724288	Well, if you want to check that out, it will be coming out soon, so check out the newsstands.
3725029	3726790	Here's some other stuff you can spend your money on.
3726990	3727411	What's that?
3728231	3729032	Sackboy plushies.
3730413	3732514	They are now on Amazon.
3733094	3736677	You can get a Sackboy and a Sackgirl for $20.
3737117	3737497	Ooh.
3740399	3742060	But they won't have any until December 30th.
3742440	3742841	Ooh.
3745322	3747143	I didn't like the look of the Sackgirl on there.
3747484	3749445	No, the Sackgirl looks stupid, but the Sackboy's pretty cute.
3751670	3752732	Sackboy is adorable.
3764841	3771186	Well, Team Fortress 2, if you don't have enough friends to play the game with you, Valve has the answer for you.
3771747	3774149	They are beta testing right now AI opponents.
3774369	3784178	Yes, you will be able to use some pretty intelligent bots as your opponents to fill in gaps that you may have on your team.
3784978	3788021	Apparently, I believe this is available now.
3788681	3790523	They do have some...
3791924	3799691	stuff you use in the console, including ways to add people to there or remove AI players and whatnot.
3800892	3808259	But apparently they're pretty cool, and they actually, I don't know, are good replacements for people that may not be there.
3808819	3815065	And I think they've done this in Counter-Strike and stuff like that, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do it here.
3817130	3820833	I've been playing ranked games, you know, now, almost every day.
3846749	3847170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3865882	3869144	Feel free to join our game because... You want to give out your gamer tag?
3869184	3870765	Yeah, LokiOLR.
3872626	3873226	All one word.
3873346	3876488	So that's... Just feel free.
3876528	3878629	You can't really be invited into the game.
3878649	3880310	You just have to kind of join a ranked game.
3880350	3882071	And trust me, there's hardly anyone playing right now.
3882191	3884212	It's really easy to join the game.
3884592	3890816	So you can just see if I'm online, most likely playing Grand Theft Auto, join the game, and prepare to get your ass kicked.
3892210	3893311	Nice, it's so modest
3918604	3923645	Well, by the way, they've come out and said, of course, deny, deny, deny.
3924505	3931627	It's come out apparently that the Sony PSP-4000 mention was a mistake on their part.
3932147	3935668	There is no new model of the PSP under construction.
3936308	3938148	Uh-huh, sure, whatever you say, dude.
3938569	3939689	Yes, just like they...
3941513	3954340	Didn't have an icon or whatever like that that was also available on Sony's website as well that someone found by changing the file name or whatever of like the PSP 3000 icon on there to the 4000.
3954420	3955821	Oh, look, it shows up.
3956862	3960324	Also, you know, Sony came out and said, oh, yeah, this is not true.
3960364	3962765	And then the company that put out the ad said, oh, yeah, this is not true.
3962805	3964166	But come on.
3964662	3970145	If they were really going to put it out and this company leaked it out, wouldn't they be telling the company, deny everything?
3970225	3970586	Yeah, I know.
3970606	3973027	The response coming here is, I don't know.
3973107	3975849	I don't know what you're talking about.
3976569	3978490	Crazy people.
3978510	3978490	$4,000.
3979211	3980812	Whether they do or not, let me put it this way.
3980892	3982673	It's not going to be significant either way.
3984734	3985635	All right, Sony.
3985755	3987456	You're not coming out with a $4,000.
3987956	3990278	I will pretend to be surprised when you announce the $4,000.
3991718	3992539	Just like with the Go.
3993271	3997213	We're not doing a UMD List PSP with a sliding screen.
3997233	3998453	That's preposterous.
3999974	4001955	Oh, by the way, the PSP Go is coming out now.
4002175	4002955	Here comes E3.
4003155	4003976	LOL, gotcha.
4006157	4006577	Oh, 4,000.
4006797	4008118	You didn't see that one coming.
4008598	4008858	No.
4009997	4036532	I think they should name it the 4001 just to spite everybody Sony, if you're listening, seriously that is how you could get the last laugh because we all know you're doing it now just suck it up name it the PSP 4001 and lol alright, we're going to take some time here on the show to respect the classics it is time for the very last classic game of the week of the decade
4038328	4040850	No, this segment will be back in 2010, of course it will.
4041210	4053020	But this is a chance for DarkSakura to dig through the gaming archives and pick a game from Gaming's Yesteryear that she says, Damn it, you ungrateful kids these days and your newfangled 360s and PS3s.
4054021	4057284	You need to go play the games we used to play back in my day.
4057744	4059425	And then she'll run over you with her walker, right?
4059686	4060786	I went, no.
4061487	4063329	I went for Epic Old School Awesome.
4063529	4066091	Alright, so what is the Epic Old School Awesome video game of the week?
4066448	4068809	The video game of the week is Salamander.
4070629	4072250	I'm pretty sure I haven't done Salamander yet.
4072590	4073470	I don't think you have either.
4073490	4074431	Which is a shame.
4074751	4076732	Well, then here is a little clip of Salamander.
4076912	4077652	Let's listen to the intro.
4092847	4094487	Now what is this Dark Sakura?
4094507	4096508	This is just Life Force, right?
4096888	4097928	Actually, yes.
4098808	4101549	Life Force is the name it came out with in North America.
4102289	4106430	So, it's a spin-off from the Gradius series.
4107730	4114211	And it actually switches between horizontal and vertically scrolling areas.
4114932	4116512	So you've got kind of a little bit of both.
4116552	4120813	It also has a more simplified power-up system, too.
4121653	4123998	and you can play two player co-op which is great.
4124459	4126043	And that's in all of the stages by the way.
4127370	4134276	So, player one is the Vic Viper, and player two is the Lord British.
4134977	4137159	And actually, did you know there's a Salamander anime?
4137339	4139461	Wait, they really called one of the ships the Lord British?
4139681	4139901	Yeah.
4140081	4142283	Like, the same guy who did Ultima Lord British?
4143124	4144365	I don't know.
4145886	4148629	Yeah, because when I hear Lord British, I think of the dude who did Ultima back in the day.
4150330	4154134	At any rate, well, you've got the Vic Viper and Lord British.
4155536	4160700	And you play through six stages, and like I said, it alternates between horizontal and vertical.
4161260	4170226	You can actually continue from where you left off upon death, instead of the checkpoint version that Gradius has.
4170786	4177771	You do not have any continues in salamander mode when you play single, but you have two continues in two-player mode.
4178371	4178892	and DarkSakura.com
4201058	4210663	I was going to say, whoever's doing this playthrough here off this YouTube, it's user Succula, S-U-C-C-U-L-L-A is the YouTube we're looking at here in studio right now where the music's coming from.
4211224	4211524	Epic.
4212264	4214245	This person knows what the fuck they're doing with this game.
4214285	4215686	They know where it's at.
4215866	4228333	Well, on top of that, just like any of the Gradius games, especially with the bosses, there are little hidey places that you can go to and ways to lure the boss or whatever to where you need it to be.
4228894	4234536	And if I'm right, I think this is a one playthrough beating of this game, which is really freaking difficult.
4234616	4235296	I love the laser.
4235316	4236477	That was my favorite weapon.
4237757	4239578	I just freaking love Lifeforce on the NES.
4239638	4243739	I mean, I realize, you know, it has its roots different places, but I remember it as Lifeforce on the NES.
4243859	4244939	Well, I got it.
4245700	4246940	Rob, if you want to play it.
4247000	4248000	Oh, yeah, I know.
4248080	4249421	I remember seeing it in the vault.
4249661	4256103	But I just kind of, you know, I like the voice in this one, but I miss the double, you know,
4257417	4257797	Option!
4258058	4258579	And all that.
4259301	4260203	Or Speed Up.
4260744	4261446	You know, but anyway.
4262468	4264112	Um, so you've got different backgrounds.
4264152	4265576	You have Starfields.
4265976	4267179	Um, you've got, uh...
4269062	4269942	All kinds of different stuff.
4269962	4278745	There's actually some big differences between the Japanese version and the European version and Lifeforce.
4279765	4297411	The Japanese and European versions are pretty much the same except the American version changes the plot to the game by having some opening text where you're actually going inside a giant alien lifeform to fight off bacteria.
4298214	4305857	and so the star fields from Salamander were actually changed to kind of a web background so that it looks more organic.
4306617	4307797	I'm sure you remember that, Rob, don't you?
4308298	4308518	Yes.
4309198	4310518	The power-ups have different names.
4310939	4318181	You have Speed Up becoming Hyper Speed, Missile becoming Destruct Missile, the Ripple Laser becoming Pulse Laser, and Force Field becoming Shield.
4318621	4320222	OMG, I love the fire level.
4321027	4321827	Yeah.
4321847	4324029	Sorry, they're in Stage 3 right now on their epic playthrough.
4324069	4325129	I love the fire.
4325149	4326270	There should be a link to Level 4.
4326330	4328771	And actually, Level 4, Rob, I wish you would place at the beginning of that.
4329191	4330652	It should be the Saturn.
4330712	4331993	Sure, you want to skip ahead a little bit here?
4332013	4332993	We'll get to the fourth one.
4333013	4336355	Yeah, but this music you'll recognize from B-Mania.
4337216	4337476	Okay.
4339924	4348827	That music right there was the beginning of the Accelerator B crush mix.
4349447	4350447	Nice.
4350967	4357889	And actually, stage 4 has my favorite music in the game.
4358089	4368232	Some other differences, your power-ups were modified a little bit to where for a
4369966	4373288	You have the same for Life Force, the Japanese Life Force.
4373408	4375789	You actually had the same power-up as Gradius.
4376309	4377430	Some music was changed.
4378210	4389155	You can, however, get the original Japanese version and the Enhanced Life Force with the Salamander Deluxe Pack that came out for PlayStation and Saturn, and Salamander Portable on PSP.
4389815	4395158	So yeah, we have the NES version, which actually came out in 87...
4399207	4407810	It actually, though, just took bits from Salamander and Life Force to kind of make it a bit of a new concept in the game.
4409710	4419254	It actually, we got the port for the NES, and it's exactly the same, except it doesn't have multiple endings like the Japanese one does, and it's just called Life Force.
4420214	4425816	All of these use the Konami code, and the NES version is out on the virtual console.
4426856	4427596	500 Wii Points.
4427616	4428096	Go get it.
4428576	4431377	There's an MSX version that's pretty different.
4432757	4444920	You have different pilots for each of the ships, which if I do remember correctly, I think that it was from the MSX version that the anime was based off of.
4445220	4446521	It's been a long time since I've watched the anime.
4446541	4447561	We've got it on DVD somewhere.
4448181	4449903	There's also a PC Engine version.
4451284	4455527	You actually have checkpoints in this one, faster enemy animations.
4457128	4459951	Actually, they improved some of the music from the arcade version.
4460471	4465976	There's Ocean Software brought it out for the Spectrum Commodore and Amstrad in 1988.
4466396	4473302	But the Commodore 64 version, Rob, you may be particularly happy to find out, was pretty much...
4474562	4477103	considered one of the best of the PC ports.
4477763	4479063	Nice.
4479283	4481524	Of course, like I said, it came out on the PlayStation and Saturn.
4482564	4486905	We got the Salamander Deluxe Pack, and also included with that was Salamander 2.
4486945	4489705	So that was Salamander Life Force and Salamander 2.
4491506	4500508	PSP, we got Salamander Portable, which had actually a few other kind of rare games in it.
4500588	4501028	It had...
4502825	4521711	Salamander, Life Force, Salamander 2, Zexix, I think that's what it's called, Zexix, X-E-X-E-X, that's a game I haven't played in a long time, and the MSX version of Gradius 2, which came out, I think, as Nemesis 2, which has nothing to do with the arcade Gradius 2.
4523604	4525826	and for the record, Gradius 2 on PC Engine.
4526186	4526726	Excellent.
4526987	4527267	Anyway.
4527867	4530630	So, yeah, here's actually the thing about the anime in here.
4530650	4535113	There was an OAV and it had to do with...
4537871	4538572	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4558447	4560588	Well, there's also a couple good soundtracks too.
4560608	4572432	There's the Salamander Arcade soundtrack, there is the original Sound of Salamander, and Salamander again, Konami Kukeiha Club, which, you know, they did a few games from that series.
4572832	4574133	I mean, a few soundtracks from that series.
4574793	4575233	So there you go.
4576074	4576434	Yummy.
4578114	4580235	Lots of Salamander-y things.
4580515	4583736	And also, I freaking love the cover of the soundtrack.
4584677	4586457	I mean, look at that and tell me that's not awesome.
4586878	4587718	I'm gonna link it in chatroom.
4588137	4590639	Yes, it's like a big demon face thing.
4590659	4592601	Kind of scary, actually, a little bit.
4592621	4593422	It's like an evil snake.
4593922	4594223	All right.
4594923	4596925	Which really has nothing to do with the salamander, I guess.
4598226	4600108	Other than being, you know, reptiles, I guess, maybe?
4600128	4609657	All right, well, there it is, your classic game of the week, Salamander, which is available on a variety of different systems, but if you want to play the original, go play the arcade version.
4610438	4611659	You can find it if you know where to look.
4612728	4615992	All right, we're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4616012	4616733	We're not done yet.
4616793	4617594	In fact, we're going to be back.
4617634	4627406	We still have some rapid-fire news, your Twitter topics, and then we're going to take a break from the news tonight and talk a little bit about what's happened this year, talk about our picks for Game of the Year.
4627626	4628147	And donuts.
4628968	4630309	And you want to talk about donuts?
4630550	4631231	I just want one.
4631291	4632132	I want a donut too.
4632904	4634545	I also want a pony.
4634605	4635445	I have a pony, Rob.
4635926	4636606	Did I tell you that?
4636786	4638127	Okay, I have to share this.
4638927	4649833	For our team, Builder, we did our annual present exchange and we were given these little pieces of paper that says write down what you want so that whoever gets our name doesn't buy us crap.
4650633	4654816	And I was like, okay, I want an Amazon gift card or this gift card or that gift card or a pony.
4655676	4659018	So someone, the person who got me, got me a toy pony.
4660182	4660783	That's awesome.
4660863	4662204	And then a gift card to Barnes & Noble.
4662905	4663125	Nice.
4663305	4664266	But I finally got my pony.
4664766	4666548	That means I have to stop asking for one at restaurants.
4667929	4669391	When they say, what can I get you tonight?
4669611	4670152	I need a pony.
4670452	4671053	Do you need anything else?
4671073	4672114	Yeah, I'd like a pony, please.
4674156	4676338	I'm going to have to stick with either the llama or the pygmy goat.
4677539	4677799	All right.
4678079	4679300	We're going to take a quick break, guys.
4679320	4684766	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in the year and the decade in review in just a few minutes.
4690660	4700287	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, December the 27th of 2009, where we're taping the 350th episode of our show.
4700867	4706792	And yes, it's the very last Orange Lounge Radio of the decade, but we'll be back next week as always to do it all again.
4706892	4715618	Since it is the last OLR of the decade and it's been a little bit of a slow news week, we're going to take some time to reflect on our favorite games of the year and of the decade.
4717159	4722228	But meanwhile, we do have a few other news stories we want to get to real quick in a segment we call the Rapid Fire News.
4722488	4723971	And of course, we'll get to your Twitter topics, too.
4723991	4729541	If you haven't sent us your tweets yet, hurry up and do that because we're going to get to those very soon, as soon as we get out our Rapid Fire News.
4729701	4730182	So, Loki.
4731516	4746776	Yes, well, if you're looking for something to do shortly after the new year, you can perhaps join the MAG Beta, which was previously not available to everybody, but starting January 4th will be, and...
4748218	4751199	You will be able to download it on the PlayStation Network.
4751760	4761023	Existing beta members will be able to update their files to prepare for the upcoming trial, which means that you shouldn't delete any of your magdata if you are already in the beta.
4761784	4764005	And apparently the beta is pretty short, though.
4764105	4769207	It is only lasting a week until, well, slightly under a week, until January 10th.
4770177	4777942	But you will be able to play 64 player sabotage matches and also 256 player domination matches.
4779903	4780764	So that's kind of neat.
4781544	4783786	And then of course the end of the game will be coming out shortly after that.
4783986	4785527	On the 26th?
4787772	4815333	Um, also on the PlayStation Network will be coming Holy Invasion of Privacy Badman 2 Um, and what's kind of cool about it as well is that you will not only be able to get the sequel But the first game will be included with it for free Um, and that is of course if you get it via the PlayStation Network No word though if, um, when they decide to put this out as an actual UMD If the original game will appear on there as well
4815973	4822998	But at least right now, it's kind of a nice bonus for people who may own the PSP Go and that's their only option.
4823358	4825040	It's kind of neat.
4826118	4836025	And then finally, in un-Sony PlayStation news, Crackdown 2 is scheduled to be coming out the first half of 2010, which makes me all sorts of happy.
4836865	4855578	And no word exactly yet when it's going to be coming, but apparently it was revealed on Major Nelson's weekly podcast that Xbox's head Aaron Greenberg apparently is saying that Mass Effect 2, Splinter Cell Conviction, and Alan Wake,
4856458	4862281	and apparently also CrackedN2 who are scheduled for the first part of the year.
4862521	4865803	So I guess Alan Wake isn't coming out later in the year like I thought.
4866303	4868204	Probably second quarter if I guessed correctly.
4869488	4871989	All right, well, some other games coming out before too long.
4872169	4875230	Resonance of Fate, some folks might be interested in this, is by TriAce.
4876311	4881913	This is already available as a demo on the Japanese PlayStation Network or the Japanese Xbox 360.
4882494	4889577	So if you have a Japanese PSN account or you have a way of getting onto the – I guess the Xbox is a little better now blocking the non-Japanese stuff.
4889917	4890617	Eh, not very good at that.
4891497	4894318	Whatever you can do to get in there, you can do that to download that demo.
4894978	4898658	If you haven't already heard about this game, it's coming out from Sega's publishing it.
4898738	4901299	It's kind of like a gunplay style RPG.
4902339	4902839	Check that out.
4902879	4903839	Resonance of Fate.
4904039	4908860	Now available in Japan or for those of you crafty folks over in other countries who know how to get in anyway.
4910421	4911541	LOL Eye of Judgment.
4911861	4916882	Yes, it's coming out on the PSP, but no camera, no cards, and apparently...
4917662	4940716	I'm not sure the UMD is really going to be there either Legends is just going to be on the PlayStation Store It's going to be there in the spring of 2010 It'll have 300 digital cards 30 that are unique on the PSP No UMD release expected at this time It's only going to be a digital download That doesn't mean it's only playable on the go Because remember, if you have a big enough memory card on the 3000 That's all you need Is that included in the bet?
4942426	4943287	Ooh, good question.
4944129	4951780	No, and the reason why is because it's not as ridiculous as The Eye of Judgment, whereas this, you know, is an actual game that can play like a traditional game.
4952321	4956948	It's not something that's, you know, a card game with this extra camera crap that's added on top of it.
4957276	4965341	I will give Loki that, I mean, let's face it, part of what made the first game so preposterous was the fact that, you know, you're playing this card game with a camera, and I think that's why he took the bet in the first place.
4965401	4967583	PSP's deleting all that weird shit out.
4968123	4979331	Yeah, it's actually a game, it'd be like almost like a translation of a Magic the Gathering game, whereas, you know, I judgment, I can imagine being played without the camera and all the extra crap.
4979571	4984254	Fair enough, guys, let's just face it, Loki's never going to lose that bet, at least not in this decade.
4985081	4986001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5008807	5012968	So don't expect any new weapons or any significant changes to gameplay.
5013408	5020390	It's just like, you know, la la la, Winter Wonderland, etc, etc, candy canes and so forth for you to blow your friends away to.
5020630	5021411	Have fun with that.
5022331	5023431	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
5024131	5024911	Some stuff.
5025692	5026732	Stuff like and such as?
5027413	5033536	Well, Sega's having a big sale in their Wii Shop channel.
5034216	5039998	You should have some of the games like Sonic 1, 2, 3, Gunstar Heroes, Streets of Rage 2, Pio Pio 2.
5043380	5046221	Basically, they're going to be $5 until January 6th.
5047321	5049082	So each of them are $3 less than usual.
5049322	5051303	And I think they just want to make some money.
5052644	5053364	So go buy them.
5055499	5064750	and as far as other stuff going on, there is a New Year's theme for free on Xbox Live, which it's pretty colorful.
5064910	5066272	Dan was using it for a little while.
5066292	5068154	It has a big ball on top of the building.
5068174	5069035	Also,
5074073	5083566	They have some other things to go with the new year that you have to pay for them, like the 2010 Avatar glasses.
5084988	5089735	And there's also the deal of the day stuff, like I believe it was the other day was Worms 2.
5090656	5091177	Some other stuff.
5092580	5107513	and then last but not least, and actually this is I think the best news of all, is there is a country pack for Rock Band, but who cares about the country crap because there's also a Paul McCartney set in there as well.
5108294	5110536	So that's actually...
5112478	5124107	It's actually December 29th is the Country Pack, which Alan Jackson's Good Time, Cross Canadian Ragweed, Cry Lonely, Jason Aldean, She's Country, Keith Urban, I Told You So.
5124708	5127410	That seems to be the only good thing in the whole packet.
5128651	5129712	Kenny Rogers, A Gambler.
5129792	5131593	Okay, maybe Kenny Rogers is a classic.
5132234	5136117	Martina McBride, This One's for the Girls, Shania Twain, Any Man of Mine, blah, blah, blah.
5136519	5142023	But the Paul McCartney Pack is going to be out on January 5th or January 7th for PS3 owners.
5142063	5143464	Haha, we'll get it first.
5143604	5145485	Xbox, Xbox.
5146005	5150168	For that set you get Band on the Run, the live, actually all these are live versions.
5151449	5154571	This is from the Paul McCartney New York City concert.
5155111	5159333	But there's Band on the Run, Jet, and Sing the Changes.
5159653	5167917	All of those are going to be 160 Xbox points or 200 Wii points each.
5170518	5175820	And these are actually, there's no telling if they're going to be available for Lego Rock Band.
5177741	5178081	Alright.
5180002	5181222	I can't wait until January 5th.
5183223	5184483	It'll start off the year with a bang.
5184803	5186504	Or a few guitar strums, whatever the case may be.
5186964	5188324	Let's get into some Twitter topics.
5189024	5194986	We've been taking some of your submissions over Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR for some things we might have missed so far in the show.
5195406	5207889	And some random-ass questions, such as this first one from Blue Swim, who tweets us, If you could bring only one celebrity who died during the Oz decade back to life, who would it be and why?
5208709	5215430	He continues on to tweet, I'd bring Heath Ledger back to life so he could reprise his role as the Joker in the new Batman movies again.
5216951	5218551	Gosh, I don't know.
5219771	5225212	To think all the way back throughout the entire decade of the O's, that's a long time.
5225252	5226213	A lot of people die.
5226573	5227533	Death just kind of happens.
5227913	5228753	So I'm not sure.
5228913	5232034	If you could bring back only one celebrity, he specifically said a celebrity.
5232674	5234634	Anybody that comes to mind for any of you?
5235394	5236755	I honestly, I'm like drawing a blank.
5236955	5237875	I don't care.
5239738	5244682	Yeah, it's kind of a weird thought.
5244702	5257293	I mean... What if one of those celebrities, if they were suddenly back, if their very presence, alive, disrupted the entire space continuum... Or if they got brought back as a zombie.
5257654	5258554	No, Rob.
5259275	5262698	Then we'd have to shoot them in the head, and we couldn't remember them in a nice way.
5263198	5263959	I would like to see...
5265325	5266726	God, the name escapes me right now.
5266826	5268107	A totally famous guy.
5268127	5269568	The guy that was with the NRA.
5269708	5271050	Not for my cold, dead hands.
5271150	5271990	Charlton Heston, was that it?
5272010	5272491	Charlton Heston, yeah.
5272511	5274552	I'd like to see him reanimated as a zombie.
5274833	5279576	I think that's the celebrity from the... I want to see Brittany What's-Her-Fuck come back as a zombie so we can shoot her.
5281438	5282939	Rude, rude, rude.
5284760	5285761	You know, this is my whole thing.
5286101	5294088	I understand mourning the loss of, like, someone's contribution, but you didn't know the person, you know?
5294844	5296244	Very good suggestion from chat.
5296264	5298265	We have a couple people yelling out Phil Hartman.
5298925	5301286	That was a very tragic thing that happened.
5301866	5303226	This is my whole thing.
5303266	5308348	When people die, it's typically when they're supposed to.
5309628	5313529	Even if it might seem stupid, it happens when it happens.
5313589	5316270	So I don't see any point in wishing for something that's not going to happen.
5317391	5319131	I really don't want to see anyone reanimated.
5319491	5322152	Just the whole zombie thing totally makes me want to puke.
5323061	5325022	Loki, was there something smartass you wanted to add?
5325463	5327384	Uh, no, I just had to see when someone died.
5327724	5329225	So, uh... Yes?
5329385	5330426	Just checking real quick.
5330646	5330806	Uh-huh.
5330826	5331106	Damn it!
5331266	5331907	That was in 94.
5332107	5332247	Oh.
5332908	5334369	No John Candy, unfortunately.
5334729	5334829	Ah.
5335449	5341333	Um, I guess I'm gonna have to go with my original thought, which was Michael Jackson, because I'd like to see him do his actual comeback.
5342974	5346156	And, uh, you know, all sorts of fun that would be involved with that.
5347357	5347657	Alright.
5348338	5349198	Let's see, um...
5350592	5355093	SSJ100 Matt sent us this on Twitter, which is a link to a story.
5355533	5357174	Police followed an Xbox trailer.
5357194	5357874	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
5358134	5358934	I take that back.
5359174	5359955	I renege that.
5360735	5364376	I would like to see... Oh, God, what's his name?
5370238	5371798	The chatroom is correcting themselves, by the way.
5371838	5372578	Phil Hartman died in 98.
5372838	5374639	Yeah, not Phil Hartman.
5377641	5386310	The other guy, the other pitchman Billy Mays Hi, Billy Mays here As a zombie No, not as a zombie
5387654	5388895	Do you see that episode of South Park?
5389775	5391256	Brilliant, that show.
5391636	5393097	Anyhow, back to SSJ100.
5393298	5394318	Matt's tweet, thank you very much.
5394818	5400522	Sent us to a story from LOHUD.com talking about police following an Xbox trail.
5401743	5412409	I guess because this guy in the Bronx was playing with a stolen Xbox 360 game system, it led them to a stash of stolen property, 200 car break-ins, and a couple of burglaries.
5412710	5414711	They were very excited to recover all this.
5415451	5434972	They went to, oh I love when they give the address in the story, it was 4064 Laconia Avenue in the Bronx is where all this stuff was hiding Apparently, they got a search warrant, they traced through Microsoft and the ISP where this stolen Xbox was being played from And it led them to a GPS system, laptop computers and all this stuff
5435618	5442622	So, uh, looks like all this stuff was retrieved from 22-year-old Jeremiah, Jeremiah Gilliam's bedroom.
5443442	5446043	To Jeremiah Gilliam, we say, uh-huh.
5447464	5448685	Next time, don't be stupid.
5449545	5457049	Stealing things is pretty stupid in the first place, but then, like, when you go and, like, play with the stolen goods on the internet, that just makes you stupid or stupid.
5458570	5460491	But let's face it, you're pretty stupid to be stealing shit in the first place.
5460511	5461972	That makes someone extra stupid.
5462529	5475605	Alright, he probably wouldn't think that they would be tracking the system, and it's almost likely that they wouldn't know what the system's serial number and that kind of stuff was, but apparently they were able to track that via history and stuff like that.
5476466	5478509	Dedication to them for trying to get it back to the Xbox 360.
5480117	5485641	Alright, we got a link from DJ Ranma S on Twitter is linking us to another kind of local New York thing.
5486682	5488944	This is coming from Gizmodo, which is kind of interesting.
5489024	5493107	It has to do with the iPhone, which some would argue is pretty much a gaming device in this day and age.
5493527	5500232	Apparently, the iPhone is not purchasable on AT&T's website if you use a New York City zip code.
5500653	5502814	Because according to a rep at...
5503755	5504435	I guess online.
5504776	5506356	New York is not ready for the iPhone.
5506376	5510438	You've heard about all these types of complaints where in New York City, like, they can't handle the iPhone bandwidth.
5510719	5513600	Calls are getting dropped left and right and all this crazy stuff.
5514100	5515201	So, yikes.
5515261	5516842	But their 3G's better!
5517002	5518423	Their commercials say so!
5518783	5521984	Am I to believe that Luke Wilson is lying to me?
5523685	5524966	I can't handle that!
5525946	5527027	That's shocking!
5529338	5532659	I think it's probably just some type of weird, creepy bug.
5532679	5535680	I don't think AT&T is going to acknowledge that this has any weight to it whatsoever.
5552864	5561292	But apparently also Tigerclaw wants to add in our chatroom, you can still go into a phone and get a, or sorry, still go into a phone, still go into a store and get the phone that way.
5562413	5563114	A little strange.
5565342	5568824	Anyhow, also going to some other news stories that were submitted.
5569305	5578871	Ray Ayanami sends us this link to Kitsui was announced for the Japanese Xbox 360s at what's called the Cave Festival.
5579372	5580873	So this is a shooting game.
5581653	5583154	Kitsui Kizuna
5584435	5611381	Jigoku Tachi Extra is coming out on the 360 that'll cost you about $50 and it's another shmup that's coming to the Xbox 360 which has been getting a lot of those but you can see some screenshots online at this shmups.system11.org web forum where they actually show people playing at Akihabara at the Cave Festival this new game and there's even some footage on the internets but there's a lot of background noise I don't want to play that for you right now
5612428	5621916	A couple stories coming to us from TigerClaw305 who is sending us some stories about, let's see, TimeGate has sued South Peak for royalties and breach of contract.
5623358	5627081	Apparently this is the folks who developed Section 8, TimeGate Studios.
5627361	5630324	They have sued South Peak because of a breach of contract.
5630604	5638531	Apparently the publisher is withholding royalty payments and violates the deal with a PS3 porting deal with a Russian company.
5642434	5654981	TimeGate What's Compensatory Damages According to the report, South Peak says that because they got in 2008 Gamecock, it exempts it from some of the specifics of the original agreement.
5656002	5658283	So yet more legal troubles.
5660285	5661345	It'll be settled out of court.
5661385	5661966	They always are.
5662186	5663306	That's how those things go, yeah?
5663326	5666889	That's what'll happen.
5667856	5675267	Let's see, also, what's also very interesting, the CEO of 3D Realms has teased a Duke Nukem resurgence.
5675687	5677149	Oh god, here we go again.
5677650	5681455	Apparently numerous Duke Nukem games are in various stages of development.
5681856	5683779	Gosh, does that include Duke Nukem Forever?
5684099	5713469	funny that you should mention Duke Nukem because remember there was supposed to be the PSP and DS versions that were coming out in September oh but those have been delayed just like Duke Nukem now I want to point out the CEO of 3D Realms did go out of his way to point out Duke Nukem Forever was not technically cancelled yes we released the initial team but that doesn't correlate to the demise of the project great so this will be now what our third decade of Duke Nukem Forever rumors we're going to get into goody goody
5715259	5720746	Our good friend Maren Marvel has tweeted us and said, What do you guys think about the Blizzard Authenticator?
5722828	5724150	I think it's a really good idea.
5724330	5725051	I hate to say it.
5726505	5730806	I had my account hacked, and I will never undo the authenticator because of it.
5730866	5733546	Especially if you're an iPhone or iTouch user, it's free.
5733907	5735287	And you get a free pet out of it.
5735707	5739648	And even if you don't have an iPhone or an iTouch, it's like $6.50 for the keychain.
5739988	5744849	Which, considering they're also charging $10 for a pet, it's not a bad deal.
5744889	5747289	And it does keep your account relatively safe.
5747729	5751030	I think it's unfortunate that Blizzard won't do more.
5751650	5753431	against these gold spammers and things.
5753471	5762155	But unfortunately, what they're doing, they're hacking a lot of American accounts and going into the games and rolling level one characters and doing all the shouts and so forth.
5762395	5763396	How well does the app work?
5763796	5763976	Huh?
5764616	5765497	How well does the app work?
5765517	5766297	Never had a problem with it.
5766357	5770459	Pretty much all you do, you boot it up and it brings you up the code right away.
5770499	5771780	But is that one that you have to pay for?
5772220	5772340	No.
5772820	5773340	It's a free app.
5773560	5774541	Well, then I'll just download it right now.
5774881	5775901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5794076	5794996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
5818764	5847078	I just I wish Blizzard would sue people I wish they would just start blocking IPs from maybe regions that are in America I mean I hate to say it but you know what there is WoW localized for other regions so maybe it's time to start locking players out from certain regions I hate to say it but if that's the way we're going to prevent but you know you can always IP spoof and all this other crazy stuff but I just wish the burden wasn't on us but hey it's free
5849681	5853864	Lastly, one more question from JazayJazz on Twitter.
5854204	5856225	Where do you think games are headed in the new year?
5857926	5860147	Digital distribution is going to be huge in the next decade.
5861028	5867372	I think a lot of these game stores are going to have to change their business model or there's a lot to lose in the coming decade.
5867392	5870734	I think digital distribution is going to be huge in the upcoming next few years.
5870794	5872715	I think that's where games are headed online.
5875281	5875621	I agree.
5875942	5881087	Honestly, we've been seeing it happen more and more, especially since Sony's been really adopting it.
5882208	5885932	Yeah, probably more digital distribution, but I don't really think things are going to change too much.
5885952	5889536	They're going to probably try to push 3D, because that's the next big thing.
5890056	5891197	And now with the two...
5895480	5915507	I don't really see, I guess truly next-gen consoles, because Wii's kind of recycled hardware if you ask me, but now they're coming out with their 3D controllers, so that's really going to be the pushes for 3D, and you're going to see almost like a new console generation kind of being formed from this.
5916047	5919569	Yeah, I honestly would not expect to see all new consoles until, like, 2013, 14.
5920029	5924172	I mean, it's gonna be a ways out, I think, especially with these motion and stuff.
5924732	5925612	Except for Nintendo.
5925852	5928774	Unless... I think Nintendo will have something very soon.
5929254	5931656	Unless it just flops and dies, you know.
5933116	5935738	And I think from Nintendo, I don't think we're gonna see anything really new.
5936979	5939260	You know, it's probably just gonna be an upgrade.
5940760	5943622	I want to point out some comments from our chat room on some of those tweets.
5944162	5948144	Misty wants to point out in our chat room, chat.orangelandrita.com Fuck that, Rob.
5948184	5956169	I keep my eye touch with me all the damn time and in my pocket at work because due to some shit that happened around work last year, I'm paranoid about my eye touch getting jacked.
5956189	5957069	Well, that's unfortunate.
5957249	5959431	F you to those stupid people that cause you to be paranoid.
5960171	5966575	I get some people, yes, they do have their eye touch with them all the time, but I also know some people that, you know, they only have it at home or at work.
5966595	5968036	You know, they don't really carry it with them everywhere.
5968076	5968356	So just...
5969016	5973095	you know what your habits are if you do have your eye touch with you all the time then maybe the blizzard thing is a good idea
5974990	5980831	SSJ100 Matt kind of jokes, I don't know if this is a joke or real, but Blizzard banning IPs in Korea is an act of war, Rob.
5981772	5996295	I'm not saying ban Korea or whatever country you want to name from the games, but if you have a game that has US servers that's meant to be played by the US that's localized for the US, Korea gets their own version of the games.
5996635	5998315	WoW's been localized for China.
5998695	6000096	WoW's out in other countries.
6000136	6000596	You know what I mean?
6001877	6007732	I, I, unfortunately if all the gold farming is coming from China, maybe it's time to put some restrictions down.
6009710	6013932	I think they also need to place some restrictions on who can do these shouts and chat and so forth.
6014652	6016993	Blizzard's done a really good job over the years though.
6017173	6021975	I mean, let's face it, every time they involve the gold hackers and the gold farmers have to get a little smarter.
6022776	6026497	I don't want to make it sound like Blizzard's done nothing because they really have done a lot.
6026977	6030479	They've gotten smart about how they do trial accounts and a lot of the various aspects of WoW.
6030939	6036381	It just sucks that they just won't play hardball and start suing the pants off of some of these people that exploit their game.
6036401	6037342	You know what I mean?
6038550	6042851	I just want to see heads roll over my account getting hacked.
6044491	6047372	Alright, that's going to do it for the Twitter topics for tonight.
6047812	6051552	Let's talk about some of the year-end news.
6051632	6058433	And we'll start off talking about some of our favorite games of the year and games you might call your game of the year.
6058493	6064634	In chatroom, we're taking your submissions as well and I'll try to keep an eye on the Twitter too for those of you that can't be in chat.
6064674	6067575	What were some of your picks for the game of the year and why?
6068275	6073239	Usually I find these Game of the Year picks to be a little silly, because it's just one person's opinion.
6073839	6077222	So keep that in mind as we talk about our favorite games of the year.
6077662	6083967	We're just gamers, we like what we like, and this is our opinion for the game that you think was the most important game of 2009.
6085308	6086469	I'll start with Loki tonight.
6086689	6087550	What do you think, Loki?
6087590	6092373	What do you think were, and if you have a couple, go ahead, but what do you think overall was probably the biggest game of 2009?
6093514	6108842	of 2009, well, probably Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was, but I didn't play that game, so, the game I liked, or at least, just, if I was gonna vote based on how much I played it, I'd say Grand Theft Auto, mainly the two expansions, because that's what I was ending up playing, and, um,
6110366	6129472	I think it's kind of neat because whereas before we wouldn't really see expansions for Grand Theft Auto we'd just see a couple other games kind of using the same engine and still we may see that relatively soon but it was kind of neat to kind of expand upon the story and kind of bring different perspectives to it and what not and it was fun.
6129532	6136914	They kind of brought back some of the old stuff that I thought should have been in there in the first place a lot of the over the top stuff because they wanted to keep it grounded in reality whatever
6139170	6141771	So that was kind of, you know, my favorite of the year.
6142171	6144992	Other important games, I think DJ Hero was pretty big.
6145012	6151254	You know, kind of a different take on the whole music game genre, and I kind of like that.
6151794	6155255	I thought DJ Hero was horrifically underrated, and it's kind of sad.
6155335	6157416	Like, you know, a lot of people were writing it off as a failure.
6157536	6164598	But, you know, in looking at my Twitter and my Facebook, it seems like DJ Hero was a big-time Christmas present that was showing up for a lot of people, so...
6165803	6169825	Maybe it'll find a second life of sorts as we get in past the holidays.
6170046	6176169	And also some of the other underrated Wii games, you know, more of the mature stuff like Mad World.
6176769	6178190	You know, I love that game.
6178230	6179311	I thought it was pretty fun.
6179691	6184614	And it's just, you know, unfortunately a lot of the mature stuff doesn't do well.
6184934	6186735	Especially when they don't put a lot of press behind it.
6186775	6189817	I mean, there is, you know, some commercials and stuff, but I don't think...
6191477	6195259	The mature audience is really that big right now on the Wii, which is too bad.
6195279	6198700	Because a lot of people have kind of given up on it and just went elsewhere.
6199040	6201001	So I'd have to vote that.
6201701	6204102	And really, unfortunately, I didn't play a lot of other stuff.
6204203	6207784	I'm sure Borderlands would be on my list if I had actually played that this year.
6208404	6211986	And there's still time, but it's unfortunate.
6212066	6214387	But that was probably a good one.
6215467	6218409	I'm sure a little bit of, I'm sure, Infamous...
6219309	6220129	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6245376	6256240	Just, we gotta joke and say it, uh, President Cat, very strange and absolutely, uh, weird game to come out, but, uh, I think it could do well over here.
6256440	6259181	I mean, there's, seriously, there's so much crap that comes out in the Wii.
6259661	6261421	I don't understand why anybody couldn't take a chance.
6261802	6268984	And there are companies like this, Graffiti Entertainment, uh, Axis Game Localization, I mean, fuck, they're bringing over Choniki.
6269524	6270224	Come on, man.
6270624	6271985	Take the gamble.
6272921	6275773	Alright, Loki's named about 20 different games for his game of the year.
6275793	6277159	What do you think, DarkSakura?
6277179	6278143	Is your list as long?
6279028	6283530	Probably not, given that I... I mean, Sims 3 came out, and that was big for me.
6283950	6286751	Because I actually really enjoy Sims 3.
6287531	6294054	I haven't gotten World Adventures, but that was... Especially now they've got out the Build a World thing for Sims 3.
6294314	6295254	That's actually pretty cool.
6295414	6304898	And the fact that, of course, it didn't take too long for all of the modders to start putting out their own hacks to the game and their own items and stuff.
6304958	6305878	So it was pretty cool.
6306678	6308139	And, of course, I love building houses.
6310742	6316306	Other stuff... Yeah, I've really been enjoying Dan play Borderlands.
6316366	6318388	I can't play it because I get motion sick.
6318548	6320730	I've got my Silent Hill that I haven't played yet.
6322371	6328135	I'm going to say, though, Street Fighter 4 was really big for me, especially getting Sakura in the home release made me happy.
6328736	6331458	Because then I could kick Dan's butt and be happy about it.
6332239	6336222	Of course, though, we got it right around the time my hand was really in bad shape.
6336762	6339124	I have to also second Tatsunoko vs. Capcom because...
6339733	6342475	Again, big Tatsunoko fan for me.
6342755	6344096	Big Capcom fan.
6344177	6347879	So the two together was just like a squeagasm in the process.
6348620	6358908	And I remember sitting on the couch and being in absolute pain and still insisting on trying to beat the stupid bouncing ball in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
6359248	6361450	I'm like, look, they're playing the Gachapon music!
6361690	6363251	Look, they're playing the Gachapon music!
6363432	6364112	I'm so happy!
6364653	6364933	You know...
6365863	6368326	Big, big squeegasm for me.
6368546	6370448	Are you looking forward to the localization next year?
6370468	6371869	Heck yeah!
6372450	6374332	As long as they leave most of it in Japanese.
6376614	6378516	I'm sorry, they've got the voice actors.
6378836	6380138	How can you go wrong with that?
6382299	6398073	um let's see my I would say there's probably three games I would bestow the game of the year honor upon one of them you'll say okay yeah I see that because it's something everybody else named uh one of them you'll say damn it Rob why'd you have to say that and then the other one you're gonna go lol what the fuck
6399417	6399858	DarkSakura, Loki,
6414397	6414997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6434992	6435332	Let's see.
6435712	6438094	Also, I would say new Super Mario Bros.
6438134	6442478	Wii is definitely worthy of the praise of Game of the Year for some of the same reasons.
6442598	6446742	And it pains me when Nintendo does this because, damn it.
6446862	6447703	I mean, Nintendo...
6449878	6451539	They really did get it right in...
6475411	6481134	A lot of people don't want to touch Mario Galaxy, as great of a game as that is, because it's like, what?
6481414	6482094	3D Mario?
6482174	6483475	Can't control?
6483675	6484315	A little weird.
6484676	6485696	But New Super Mario Bros.
6485756	6487637	Wii kind of takes Mario back to its roots.
6488017	6489778	And it's like, oh, jump on Goomba.
6489798	6490538	That was pretty funny.
6490879	6491719	That was pretty fun.
6491879	6494140	And it's absolute chaos getting a bunch of people together.
6494480	6499343	It is hell in four-player mode, but I still kind of applaud Nintendo for making it work, so to speak.
6501484	6503605	I thought it was an awesome game.
6504445	6507847	It brought a lot of gamers back to gaming.
6507927	6514111	Sometimes you want to hate Nintendo for this, but like I said, it's a diamond in the rough of the Wii software that's out there.
6515427	6518149	Here's my LOL what the fuck pick for game of the year.
6518309	6520050	And I honestly think it's deserving.
6520230	6523332	And a lot of people are forgetting that this game is from this year.
6523712	6527855	But it is absolutely one of the best things to happen to gaming this year.
6528515	6530516	1 versus 100 on Xbox Live.
6530717	6534099	I think absolutely deserves the accolade of one of the games of the years.
6534659	6535339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6553286	6556168	It's kind of neat that you're actually playing for real money.
6556548	6559130	I mean, it's such a different type of game.
6559430	6563493	I give it such props for being new, different, and fun.
6563954	6568377	Best of all, if you happen to be an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, it's free.
6569397	6571759	Or even the Silver folks got it free for a little while.
6571819	6574301	So, you know, it's fair to say that this game was free.
6574801	6577283	So, how can you go wrong?
6577463	6581066	I think 1 versus 100, in some ways, is the game of the year.
6582006	6601558	and for whoever was asking earlier where are games going in the future I'll bet you see some more stuff like this the interactive stuff I think it's going to be very cool to see how that plays out in the next decade so check that out so those were our games of the year what about you guys in our chat room some of you guys were naming some of your things here
6604141	6605902	GameGuru says, what's wrong with Street Fighter 3?
6606483	6611826	Well, okay, it's pandering to the base, but still, I don't want to buy Street Fighter 4 when Super Street Fighter 4 is coming out.
6612187	6617690	Yeah, that was unfortunate that Super Street Fighter 4 was announced kind of soon because, you know, it devalued the original.
6618111	6623674	But, you know, we had Street Fighter 2 and Super Street Fighter 2, so I guess it's nothing too unheard of there.
6624315	6625596	Let's see, um...
6627662	6630524	TigerClaw says Game of the Year for me is Batman Arkham Asylum.
6630544	6631825	You know, that did get a lot of props.
6632686	6634227	Very good storytelling in that game.
6634247	6637670	And certainly panders to fans of Batman in the comic form.
6637950	6639991	They did a really good job with that game.
6640031	6641112	They really did.
6643134	6648378	You know, I really, really liked Harley in that game.
6648778	6650900	You know, that's actually a game that convinced one of my friends to get an Xbox.
6651414	6652375	It's really good storytelling.
6653016	6653236	It was.
6653796	6656359	SJ100Matt says, from the sports side here, NHL 10.
6657219	6661343	Not only was it great, but it beat out Madden 10 for the best sports game at the VGAs.
6661844	6663785	A hockey game beating out a football game?
6663886	6664146	What?
6665353	6674376	Well, we've also got a contribution from Marin, Beatles Rock Band, which actually I'm going to have to go with as well, but he knows she'd say that.
6674956	6675336	Of course.
6675416	6676176	Heart, heart, heart.
6676617	6679257	Beatles Rock Band was an excellent implementation.
6679757	6683839	I'm still opting for DJ Hero as my music game of the year, but I...
6684927	6690008	I do respect greatly Beatles rock band and I think it was badly needed.
6690148	6691829	I think getting it out was a big achievement.
6692169	6693109	I think so too.
6694590	6698211	Just to get everybody on stage at E3 to announce it, that was epic.
6698651	6707753	Come on, having Yoko Ono, George Harrison's wife, McCartney, Ringo Starr, all on stage at once, pretty awesome.
6709014	6709794	Pretty, pretty awesome.
6711860	6719807	Speaking of some of the things that happened this year, just kind of like trekking back, and it's kind of funny to look back sometimes on what happened in previous months, kind of see where that put us this year.
6720107	6722249	Just quickly going through some of the big things that happened this year.
6722289	6728395	If you look at January and some of the things that happened there, a lot of restructuring and layoff news.
6728455	6731557	Sony did some restructuring and announced a $2.9 billion loss.
6731958	6732759	Microsoft...
6733379	6734460	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6759870	6765190	and interesting because maybe that indie development is going to lead to more digital distribution as we talked about before.
6767393	6767713	Let's see.
6768033	6769214	Moving on to February.
6769754	6770975	Some of the things that happened there.
6771375	6772536	Unfortunately, more losses.
6772756	6775217	EA cut back 11% of their workforce.
6775617	6778719	Activision, Blizzard, I don't know how the hell they lost money, but they sure did.
6779399	6782781	And they did not do any huge layoffs, though, at that time.
6783341	6790485	Also, though, what I thought was interesting, Wii Fit sold 777,000 copies in January.
6790545	6792666	That news would then roll over to February.
6793127	6793347	So...
6794447	6799830	WeFit was obviously a big piece of gaming in 2009 that none of us named in our game of the year.
6800810	6803452	Has WeFit been good or bad for gaming?
6803492	6804092	What do you guys think?
6805133	6813677	I wouldn't say in terms of gaming, but it's definitely been good in terms of making exercise enjoyable.
6814137	6816298	WeFit is not something that I really consider to be a game.
6817099	6818299	I consider it to be a tool.
6818799	6819760	It's a fun tech demo.
6820305	6820906	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6837802	6838382	Game Game Game Game
6866295	6868076	You want to see a party-free 2010?
6869257	6872039	I would like to see them actually go back to what worked before.
6872200	6873781	You don't necessarily need the change.
6874942	6876403	Make some good side-scrolling games.
6876503	6879585	Make some good games that utilize the technology.
6880386	6881867	Everything doesn't have to be a party game.
6881887	6884188	Everything doesn't have to be a waggle-fest.
6886380	6887221	Do it what worked!
6887401	6888301	I mean, I don't understand it.
6888362	6898469	We had, you know, a lot of games selling back in the day of, like, the Super Nintendo and stuff, and even the NES and whatnot, and they didn't really rely on a lot of gimmicks.
6899470	6902212	Made Mode 7, but I mean, come on, it wasn't that bad.
6903584	6904685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6931784	6934885	and soon TVs later in the year, although of course that never happened.
6938586	6940327	What do you think about OnLive in the future of that?
6940647	6943668	I think that if it works like they say it is, then it's a good thing.
6943828	6952151	I mean, it'll be pretty popular because everybody's really digging the streaming stuff nowadays, especially with Netflix and other video services out there.
6952711	6958673	And Steam as a digital distribution platform has done pretty well, so kind of combining the two...
6960259	6960819	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6983294	6984895	Some of the news as we moved into April.
6985416	6986997	Will Wright left EA.
6987818	6993122	I kind of forgot that that happened, but that's when an epic designer leaves a big company like that.
6993162	6994904	You always kind of wonder what the heck is going on there.
6995624	6998207	Also, the disappointing sales of Chinatown Wars.
6998247	7003851	Remember how in 2008, Nintendo got up there at E3 and said, hey, we've got a Grand Theft Auto game coming to the DS.
7003871	7005373	It's going to be awesome, and it's going to, you know...
7005993	7006854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7026479	7027740	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7048695	7049176	What the fuck?
7049596	7051638	I mean, so you can do it, but you just didn't.
7051758	7053520	You didn't really put the effort into it.
7053580	7056744	Instead, you made these little mini games that involved the DS stylus.
7058546	7062710	I guess that's neat and all, but it just really didn't hook me in like the other ones.
7064492	7068176	I guess my standards have gone up since 1 and 2.
7069451	7074856	Well, not a lot happened in May, but then we got into June, and June was, of course, the big E3 Expo.
7075696	7089508	And at E3 was when we got a hell of a lot of news, including the unveiling of Project Natal from Microsoft, Sony showing their ice cream cone controller, whatever that thing is supposed to be for their motion sensing, and then Nintendo showing the Wii Vitality Sensor.
7090649	7097715	Looking back on E3 this year, any kind of thoughts about how the show went or kind of where we are now six months later?
7098433	7100594	I think everyone was still pooping themselves over Natal.
7101935	7109859	I think that Nintendo disappointed once again, you know, not as bad as the year prior, but this year was kind of pathetic.
7110059	7120365	And, I'm sorry, the Wii Vitality Sensor... Okay, remember with the Wii Fit Balance Board, it's like, oh, it's going to revolutionize how you do these exercise games and stuff?
7120425	7127089	And great, now we have a bunch of these games that have the Balance Board sensors in there, and we use it, and okay, that's great.
7128183	7134087	Not a real huge step, I guess, but it's neat nonetheless.
7134387	7137910	The Vitality Sensor, I'm sorry, I don't see what the point is of this.
7138670	7139431	I just don't get it.
7139611	7142113	And I know they're gonna have that stupid game, We Relax, come out.
7143074	7146196	Great, you'll sell some copies of that, but I think it's crap.
7147349	7149651	What happened to that Metroid game that Team Ninja was doing?
7149791	7154196	I mean, we saw a neat little preview at E3 and, like, literally not a damn thing since then.
7154216	7157559	Yeah, it's promises of stuff that'll come later on, like, next year.
7157859	7160502	Like, I'll be surprised if that game comes out this year.
7161083	7162324	I will be surprised.
7162504	7162764	2010, you mean?
7163005	7163565	Yeah, 2010.
7164947	7169691	I'll be surprised if it makes it out in 2010, but... I don't know, it's just...
7170854	7171794	Thank you for watching!
7189443	7189943	They're coming!
7190364	7192645	Don't worry, just be patient.
7192665	7194967	I gotta play devil's advocate here, though, because of what I just said.
7195407	7201392	One of the other things Nintendo revealed at E3 this year, which was not expected by any means, was new Super Mario Bros.
7201472	7204474	Wii, which, I'm sorry, is one of the best games that came out this year.
7204654	7205315	It really was.
7205715	7212160	Yeah, that's pretty sad that that's the best game that came out this year from Nintendo, a company that, you know, had really innovative games in the past.
7212440	7217584	All have been, you know, really great titles, except recently some of their games that they released are kind of, eh,
7218024	7218724	You know, whatever.
7218964	7219665	I don't really care.
7220545	7222306	I mean, seriously, what did they release this year?
7222686	7223406	Let me think here.
7224887	7236171	So we had Wii Fit Plus, which was basically just a port of Wii Fit now with some added crap on there, and we're going to throw it in for a discount just to capitalize on Wii Fit again because people may have forgotten about it.
7236691	7239472	We had Wii Sports Resort, which comes with an extra sensor.
7239492	7241853	That really should have been in the Wii Remote to begin with.
7242153	7247035	It's kind of what they really promised with the Wii from the get-go, but, oh, we just couldn't do it.
7247495	7248176	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7270048	7270909	And it was great!
7270989	7272649	It was a great game that came out this year.
7272709	7278192	Yeah, that, okay, and then Metroid Prime Trilogy, which was just a rehash of some old stuff.
7278452	7285695	Then they added the new Play Control series, which is basically ported GameCube games that they've added some Wii controls to.
7286215	7286555	Great!
7286896	7290797	I'm glad you have the ability to port GameCube games and add Waggle to them.
7291237	7292138	Way to be innovative.
7294966	7296327	I'm sorry, it's just, you know...
7320959	7328900	I kid you not, the descriptions are almost identical, except they changed the name of the game, because some people might get fooled by that.
7330279	7334583	And what did they have other than the Zelda game for the DS, which was kind of cool.
7335443	7341668	Let's see, they had some style simulation game, because God forbid there's not enough of those on the DS.
7343450	7347613	Between Ubisoft and Dreamcatcher, there's so many damn games for girls.
7347994	7350035	I mean, it just got lost in the fray right there.
7350476	7355160	And a lot of things that they released, I think Nintendo thinks that their name's going to sell these titles.
7356041	7357202	Well, that's not been the case.
7357582	7361605	Fossil Fighters, hello, there's been other games that have been put out exactly the same as that.
7363987	7365288	It's just they just don't get it.
7365428	7370432	And I'm sure they're going to promise some more stuff, maybe Pikmin 3, and then everyone will shit their pants because it's Pikmin 3.
7370773	7374716	And it's going to come out, it's going to be exactly the same as Pikmin 2, just with some extra shit.
7374936	7377218	And people are going to buy into it because they're fucking cheap.
7380315	7381616	Galaxy 2 is on the way too
7410051	7410931	New power-ups?
7411612	7415293	Oh my god, oh, I take everything back that I said about Nintendo.
7415333	7418314	If they have new power-ups in there, then, god forbid, game of the year.
7420675	7424416	And Super Mario Galaxy 2, yeah, I'm sure that'll be very different than Galaxy 1.
7424616	7426297	Oh, we added some different levels now.
7427097	7427697	Praise us.
7428418	7434620	All the work's been done on the engine before, but now we have new levels and new gimmicks, and you're gonna think, oh my god, it's so awesome!
7437161	7439063	and Yellen, that same little girly voice.
7439383	7441004	Maybe we'll get Twilight Princess 2.
7441064	7444727	It'll be exactly the same as Twilight Princess 1, but it'll have some slightly new levels in it.
7444907	7447149	Maybe they'll fuse them and do Majora's Princess.
7447289	7448870	You know there's going to be the Zelda game.
7449451	7451752	That's going to be the big thing they're going to unveil at E3 this year.
7451792	7453554	Mark my words, 2010 predictions.
7453674	7457357	New Zelda will be the thing that Nintendo tries to redeem themselves with this year.
7457377	7459058	You know what's great about Nintendo, though?
7459158	7459719	DarkSakura.com.
7471860	7477145	You know, anything that you want them to do correctly, they're never going to do anymore because, you know what, you'll buy their shit.
7477646	7479087	I'm sorry, I still stand by it.
7479147	7487796	As much as you're calling it recycled garbage and all this stuff, if it's still a good game, like, I think Mario Galaxy 2 has the potential to be really awesome.
7488097	7492942	Because Galaxy 1 was great, and if they just improve on that, it's going to get even better.
7493996	7499680	I mean, you can't say that they don't have sequels and rehash shit on the 360 and the PS3 as well.
7499780	7501941	Oh, they do, and I call them out for it.
7503422	7506844	We have a game that comes out every year that's a rehash of the last year's game.
7507224	7508005	We call it Madden.
7509265	7510146	And NBA Live.
7511347	7512227	And NBA 2K.
7512748	7513728	And Dance Dance Revolution.
7513748	7514889	And Dance Dance Revolution.
7516070	7517911	And God forbid, you know, Call of Duty.
7518811	7522994	No, um... There's a lot of companies that are guilty of that, but...
7524397	7527309	The fact that Nintendo has the balls To go, hey look
7528220	7530982	We're taking these GameCube games and we're putting them on the Wii.
7531162	7531602	They're new.
7532242	7533583	Because they're now on the Wii.
7534164	7537546	And they have... We didn't really do anything to them other than change the controls.
7537566	7541068	If that's the case, where the fuck is my F-Zero?
7541408	7545531	That is the one GameCube game I have yet to see come over to the Wii.
7545851	7552475	And might I point out, not only is it just a GameCube game, it was the best fucking GameCube game that ever came out.
7552615	7557758	Well, I'm sorry, they have to do Donkey Kong's Jungle Beat first because apparently people like that
7558118	7558418	Game.
7558778	7561419	It didn't sell very well with the bongos, but hey, you know.
7561679	7562220	And you know what?
7562260	7569543	We can also do a Donkey Kong racing game that used to be with the bongos, but uh, no, now we're just gonna add some sort of rival controls.
7569563	7569903	Three words.
7570083	7570583	Three words.
7571063	7573264	Fuck Donkey Kong.
7574064	7580687	Donkey Kong is best left to the memory of the Super Nintendo, awesomely 3D rendered games, Donkey Kong countries that were there.
7581327	7581907	I'm over it.
7582728	7583468	Let's move on.
7584368	7585649	Where's my F-Zero game?
7587247	7591429	Dude, where's my good updated Star Fox?
7592090	7595552	And they always manage to take their sequels and fuck them over in some way.
7595932	7598013	Perfect example, Excite Truck.
7598493	7600334	The best racing game on the Wii.
7601054	7604516	Sequel, set to come out, ExciteBots Trick Racing.
7604816	7606137	What the fuck did you do there?
7606477	7607838	Oh, people like Transformers.
7610239	7613301	What the fuck does throwing a pie at a clown have anything to do with racing?
7613461	7615482	It doesn't have anything to do with racing.
7616454	7618497	and God forbid they just shit on that sequel.
7619258	7625206	But I was an idiot and bought it because, you know, I had hope that it was going to be as good as the original, but no, it wasn't.
7626869	7630594	Fool me once, you will not fool me twice.
7631912	7634734	I see some chat, and the chat's kind of flying right now.
7634794	7639198	I can't really keep up with it, but I do see GameGuru saying something about the God of War collection.
7639618	7641480	It's God of War 1 and 2 in HD.
7641660	7642060	Rawr!
7642141	7644543	I mean, does that fall into... At least it's in HD.
7644923	7650067	If they improve the graphics on the Wii games, on those new play control games, hey, that's different, okay?
7650087	7652249	Because that's, you know... What, would they have widescreen now?
7653510	7653630	Oh.
7654671	7656853	Well, I take it all back.
7659665	7667910	F-Zero on the GameCube had widescreen support.
7668010	7672332	It had, if I remember right, progressive scan support and all that fancy stuff on the GameCube.
7672352	7673092	Same with God of War 2.
7673132	7676554	That also had 720p support through a code.
7680737	7680997	Anyhow.
7682293	7683933	Can we move on past the Nintendo hatred?
7683953	7684433	Yes we can.
7684493	7686534	And the thousands of subscribers we just lost.
7686994	7689834	All the Nintendo fanboys crying in the corner.
7690414	7697816	I still stand by, you know what, again, the thing that pisses me off about Nintendo is that it's not that I don't disagree with Loki.
7698536	7700636	Most of what he's saying I pretend to agree with.
7700976	7706717	But then they release that one fucking game that's so fucking great I have to have it.
7706817	7708458	And it justifies the purchase of a Wii.
7708838	7710738	And then you have all this shit
7711258	7717279	Out there flooding the market in that one game on the goddamn Wii that you just aren't going to get anywhere else.
7718740	7719880	Like new Super Mario Bros.
7719920	7720100	Wii.
7721060	7726021	Just like, okay, like Mario Kart, you know, Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64.
7726441	7731222	The best fucking deathmatch, you know, battle mode ever was in those games.
7731882	7735003	And then the GameCube and the Wii version, they just like...
7736877	7738538	Let's just fucking ruin it.
7739319	7741140	We don't know what plays that.
7742201	7743021	Who cares?
7743441	7744662	We'll just fuck it over.
7744742	7746924	You think that's how the boardroom meetings go?
7748440	7776251	let's fuck this game up just for fun today we're in a recession let's have fun with it all they had to do was leave it exactly the same and just make new levels that's it, no improvement needed it was perfect the way it was but somehow they just go throwing it together and they just ruined the whole thing because they wanted to improve upon it way to go have you ever heard the phrase if it ain't broke don't fix it
7778368	7779389	All right, let's move on.
7803547	7804668	What happened to Midway?
7830662	7834725	Well, Loki's ranting just got the temperature up in here about 10 degrees, so I needed to cool off a little bit.
7835025	7835665	Sorry, DarkSakura.
7837006	7842149	I think that it was just, it was bound to happen.
7842309	7843590	You know, they've been losing money.
7844370	7853675	And, you know, especially given, I think, weren't they still the ones who solely owned the Mortal Kombat franchise for a while?
7855056	7856677	Those games certainly weren't doing much of anything.
7857530	7861092	Yeah, sadly, I mean, they had the DC Universe game, but it was... That was crap.
7861672	7861952	Yeah.
7863933	7865234	I think it was just inevitable.
7865434	7867775	Because apparently Blitz League did not pay the bills.
7868635	7873597	And then their next genius idea, which thankfully never came out, This is Vegas.
7874338	7877439	Yes, the game that simulates going to Vegas.
7878039	7882021	Partying, driving cars, having sex with women, and gambling.
7884202	7884382	What?
7884402	7884482	What?
7886657	7913137	Let's see, some of the news that came out of August Apparently Wii Sports Resort was the best-selling game of August There you go, Loki, I thought I'd mention that just for you And the PlayStation 3 Slim was unveiled So let's get away from Nintendo for a minute here And talk about maybe the PlayStation 3 Because I think this was probably the smartest thing Sony did all year It was something they should have done a year ago Was drop the price down to $2.99 Yes, they were retarded from the get-go Saying, oh yeah, our system's gonna be $5.99
7915199	7915799	What?
7915819	7916760	Don't you remember that YouTube?
7916800	7918861	Because I know we played it on this show like a million times.
7919181	7927846	It was the press conference in under a minute that would go $599 US dollars, $599 US dollars, and just like over and over again.
7928347	7929607	Because that really was the moment.
7929867	7932889	Like everybody was like so jazzed about the PlayStation 3 and then they're like, it's going to be $599.
7933169	7939033	And everybody's like, I remember us watching that on TV.
7939053	7941374	We were like, are you fucking kidding me?
7942114	7942795	Or Africa.
7944793	7947694	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai Ridge Racer
7972839	7977961	The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change and the consumers are ready.
7979201	7983403	Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.
7983943	7985464	Ridge Racer!
7986204	7995187	Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.
7995907	7998208	So here's this giant enemy crab.
7998788	8000189	Ridge Racer!
8001320	8005142	and Mew attack its weak point for massive damage.
8005423	8006363	It's Ridge Racer.
8007544	8008985	Ridge Racer.
8009145	8012147	PlayStation 3 will retail for 599 US dollars, 599 US dollars, 599 US dollars.
8012167	8012487	Giant enemy crab.
8012507	8013067	599, 599, 599 US dollars.
8013087	8013607	It's Ridge Racer.
8025462	8026884	Ridge Racer!
8027385	8033813	That is the best thing to come out of the decade by the way in gaming was that little one minute clip from YouTube user Macaw45.
8033833	8034614	Congratulations.
8039284	8040565	Why didn't they do it sooner, Loki?
8040665	8044689	Why didn't Sony figure out, maybe we should have dropped the price a long time ago?
8045530	8047632	Were they just stubborn with the whole blue rate thing?
8047652	8054738	It was just a matter of if they would have dropped the price sooner, they would have sold more units, but they would have also lost their ass from the cost of the system.
8054878	8059843	And the problem was just building a system with that much in components in the first place.
8061537	8071262	It's just, it's tough to justify, you know, so they end up having to cut some corners and stuff, and once the, you know, prices of the components came down, they could actually justify dropping the price of the system.
8072222	8075684	It was a little late, so they have some catching up to do, but we'll see.
8077119	8080623	September, some other companies followed along with some price drops.
8080723	8081744	The Wii dropped to $200.
8082565	8083667	That happened in September.
8084227	8090174	And some of the information came out about the PSP Go that there would be no conversion that happens.
8090194	8097683	Like if you own a UMD and you want to upgrade to the PSP Go, you can rebuy your game because of licensing issues.
8099750	8100691	licensing issues.
8101432	8104394	But wait, the PSP Go wasn't confirmed yet, was it?
8104815	8106816	I think by September it was.
8106836	8108778	They showed it at E3, dummy.
8108818	8109859	No, it wasn't at E3.
8110440	8110920	Yes, it was.
8110940	8112281	It was in that back room, wasn't it?
8112602	8113482	You were wrong.
8114263	8116425	I could have sworn it was there.
8116465	8118046	PSP Go was shown at Gamescom.
8119067	8119328	Fine.
8120709	8122671	So by September, Gamescom would happen anyway.
8122691	8122971	Yeah.
8126296	8131879	Let's see, and then moving on into kind of more recent things that happened to kind of sum up 2009.
8133379	8140222	Well, when the PSP Go finally did launch in October, that added 100 PSP games to the PlayStation Network.
8142163	8144124	And that was really some of the biggest stuff that came out.
8144164	8146325	Otherwise, some of the stuff about...
8148120	8174991	Modern Warfare 2 was coming out pretty soon and some news about the DSi XL although that hasn't come out yet the news the early news that came out in October DSi XL what do you think it's just it's unnecessary I'm really at the point of all of this that I'm like whatever people are gonna buy it whatever I'm not getting one not yet anyway
8176263	8177564	It's unnecessary, it really is.
8177844	8179185	Let's keep shrinking down the system.
8179286	8180106	Oh wait, let's make it bigger.
8180126	8183469	Okay, put the Game Boy Advance slot back in it then.
8183889	8184750	If you're going to make it bigger.
8184910	8185551	Oh no, we can't do that.
8187733	8188093	Alright.
8188733	8189854	What's the point of making the screens bigger?
8190555	8191496	For old people!
8191616	8192397	Because bigger's better!
8193217	8194298	Yeah, it's for old people.
8194698	8198341	But remember with the Game Boy Advance, smaller was better, hence the micro.
8198762	8201924	And then that didn't sell very well, so they must have said, oh never mind, bigger's better!
8202245	8202405	Right?
8202425	8202525	Right.
8203869	8205610	And it's a spectator system now, remember?
8205990	8208211	Because people want to watch you play DSi games.
8212032	8215053	Then I suggest you put a video out on the system.
8215874	8216654	There's a thought!
8217914	8218755	Play it on your TV.
8219135	8233060	And yes, I understand that that wouldn't really make sense, you know, playing a DSi on a TV since it's dual screen, but hey, you could maybe put, you know, split the video signal or something, or you could just put the top screen on there.
8234884	8235144	All right.
8235164	8236465	Bottom screen, whatever.
8236545	8239106	Just jamming through the last couple months here because they did just happen.
8239146	8241407	In November, of course, EA cut 1,500 jobs.
8241427	8242868	That was 17% of their games.
8243168	8244429	Canceled a dozen games.
8245009	8249692	Not a good year for EA in that department because that was the second big layoff story we got out of EA in the year.
8250552	8258737	And that was also the month where we had a funny story about how World of Warcraft was closed in China for three months, and we kind of joked about what would happen if you couldn't log into World of Warcraft for three months.
8258777	8261378	There would be some people that just wouldn't know what to do with themselves.
8261418	8262699	People would go outdoors.
8264382	8265722	And then they would take all my oxygen.
8266063	8267303	What can we do about that?
8267784	8275109	And then one of my favorite rumors that came out in December, that Logitech apparently is making a UMD add-on for the PSP Go.
8275369	8277710	I mean, how ridiculous is that idea?
8278551	8280172	A, why would that be coming from Logitech?
8280332	8282153	Unless I guess they're doing it on behalf of Sony or whatever.
8282474	8283794	But still, just what?
8284675	8285536	It's dumb.
8285576	8286236	Isn't that the point?
8287197	8288398	Why would you... First off...
8289258	8290079	Why would you buy that?
8290759	8298104	I don't understand why you would even pay the money to buy a UMD add-on for a system that was more expensive than the PSP-3000 in the first place.
8299565	8305809	And the PSP-3000 has everything that the Go has, with the exception of the Bluetooth, which is fine.
8306550	8310453	But I just don't understand why you would do that.
8311553	8312414	You'd have to be pretty dumb.
8313772	8319336	Just pull the PSP, go off shells already and cut your losses and make a PSP 2 or something, I don't know.
8319957	8325141	Alright, that does it for kind of like our year little wrap up there, kind of walking down memory lane and some of the stories there.
8325161	8326882	We're going to get to the decade in a little bit.
8327303	8337711	I'm going to kind of just open up the Skype line to kind of talk about the decade and we'll get to that in a minute, but of course we do have some segments we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio and one of them is very important.
8338171	8338572	It's our...
8339332	8367855	moments of angst because there were a lot of stupid people this year and stupid people that robbed things and you know like that guy who stole the Xbox and then played it so they were able to find who they were just a lot of stupidity out there he who shall not be named the lawyer that was disbarred one of my personal highlights of the year 2000 to 2010 and so forth anyhow we're going to call this our FUs of the week but in some regards maybe this is the FUs of the decade I don't know here they are the FUs of the week
8383415	8393260	I actually do have an FU of the week, and that just goes to the TSA for putting in stricter ticket rules, I guess, where your name has to fully match.
8394600	8403744	And my credit card information, you know, when I buy my ticket, it's going to come up under my name as I have it listed for my billing information, which is not exactly how my name shows on my license.
8404244	8405045	So yeah, annoying.
8405505	8406765	But that's about it.
8406805	8410027	And then as far as the year, or the decade, I should say,
8411605	8415707	Um... The... The biggest FU has actually already happened, Rob.
8417508	8418788	What's-his-fuck-got-disbarred?
8419768	8423350	If that's not a ginormous FU, I don't know what is.
8425251	8426051	Alright, fair enough.
8426131	8428292	Loki, what are your FUs of the week and the decade?
8429452	8431633	Uh... I don't really know.
8432013	8439617	Um... Guess... FU to... I don't really have anything.
8440477	8440517	Um...
8441940	8445783	I guess I feeded myself for not being able to play a lot of games during the holiday break.
8446043	8457251	I think a lot of time I wasted trying to get games for my MAME cabinet, which I should just really play on the MAME cabinet, because I have, what, thousands of games on there already, and I haven't touched most of them.
8457811	8460373	So, uh, why do I need more games?
8460553	8462534	I know, because I need more of everything, that's why.
8462554	8467738	Um, and then the FU of the decade goes to, uh...
8470148	8471049	God, I don't even know.
8471069	8474250	That's tough to just nail down one thing.
8474510	8481855	I guess... To Nintendo for disappointing us on a consistent basis.
8482435	8483976	And goddamn it, Embrace Online!
8486457	8490059	My FU of the week... I don't know, I'm not super angsty.
8490099	8494942	My FU of the week goes to... Selfishness.
8496665	8501555	I think there's some selfish people out there I'm learning about and I don't like it.
8502706	8507910	My FU of the decade goes to people that steal things that aren't theirs.
8508611	8512394	You might remember this decade my car was broken into a multitude of times.
8512754	8519200	We had these people talking about, you know, stealing Xboxes and so forth that stupidly sign on to them online.
8519520	8522422	Stealing passwords and using them to hack people's account.
8522943	8527166	FU to people that don't have the common decency to not touch shit that isn't theirs.
8528647	8529708	Oh, and FU to Proposition 8.
8529888	8530809	That was pretty fucked up too.
8532605	8533465	Hey, back to the show.
8533846	8538227	How about the segment of the show where we open up ye olde mailbag and see what our listeners have to say?
8538848	8543310	That would be at our mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com address.
8551193	8552353	We have two emails.
8552654	8552994	Alrighty.
8553494	8558436	First one, hey, OLR, I was in Spanish class a few days ago and thinking about the new year.
8558876	8560217	We should have been focusing on Spanish.
8561554	8566717	Then I started thinking about really crappy games with peripherals that no one will buy like Band Hero and Tony Hawk Ride.
8567137	8570540	So my question to you is, what are your peripheral predictions for the new year?
8570880	8574502	Personally, mine will be Knife and Fork and stuff like that for a new Cooking Mama game.
8576303	8577544	They've already done that, actually.
8579161	8583485	Well, you know, there's actually a burger flipping ticket game that came out in Japan.
8584786	8590370	I think that we're going to get Bunga Bunga for the home, and it comes with a real finger-to-butt peripheral.
8590490	8592953	Whatever happened to the table flipping game that was out in Japan?
8593013	8593833	I'd like to see that out here.
8593853	8594234	It's out in Japan.
8594414	8594994	That's about it.
8595054	8596175	What about here?
8596195	8601740	I wonder if Bunga Bunga is actually, or Bunga Bunga or whatever, is emulated in MAME yet.
8604090	8604550	Go get it.
8604951	8605631	Go get it, Loki.
8605771	8606052	Go get it.
8606072	8610255	Because if it is, that would be one hell of a fun game to make a peripheral for.
8611956	8613197	Dot, dot, dot.
8614398	8620282	As far as the rest of the email, what I think next year, as far as peripherals go, you already know, it's the motion sensor stuff.
8620503	8622904	Natal and the ice cream cones from Sony.
8622964	8625506	Those are going to be the huge things, game changers, that come out next year.
8625967	8627208	They're also going to come out with the...
8628860	8644634	I think not just necessarily something that reads your motion, but also I would actually like to see something that doesn't necessarily view your motion as much as checks your coordination.
8644774	8645314	You know what I mean?
8646315	8649338	Like it gives you something like a full motion sensing DDR.
8650811	8655096	Where it gives you your commands and then you have to mimic exactly.
8655356	8659280	Or even charades online.
8661122	8661763	Could you imagine that?
8661823	8662844	You know what I don't want to see?
8663104	8663645	That would be fun.
8663685	8665006	I like that charades online idea.
8665026	8668189	But what I don't want to see is this whole brain scanning thing.
8668209	8669651	Have you heard about the brain devices?
8669691	8672073	Like the game that you control with your brain and all this stuff?
8672434	8673235	I don't like that idea.
8674896	8675677	I don't like that at all.
8675717	8677938	I hope that isn't where peripherals go next year.
8678959	8681561	I don't like the whole thought reading thing.
8681641	8683002	It's kind of a little freaky to me.
8684423	8686324	Call me a warrior or whatever.
8686484	8688506	Just a little weird.
8689966	8690746	Anything else in the mail rag?
8691186	8691386	Yes.
8691566	8692587	Well, there's still more to that one.
8692967	8693427	Oh, my bad.
8693887	8695267	Yeah, Rob.
8696068	8697248	Sorry, I have to give you a hard time.
8698368	8700589	As soon as I can find where the crap my thing went to.
8700649	8701089	There we go.
8702529	8704890	Also, I wondered where you guys get your news from.
8704930	8707110	Do you have a set or are you all over the place?
8707750	8711811	My favorite right now is GamesWithAZTraffic.com.
8711871	8712291	Look it up.
8712452	8713012	Thanks, Mike.
8714372	8716192	I think you should give somebody a free plug.
8716773	8717113	Why not?
8717293	8717633	I don't mind.
8718033	8718293	All right.
8719003	8720706	I go to Eurogamer for a lot of my stuff.
8721487	8721607	Yeah.
8737093	8738274	Also, another one.
8738394	8739114	Hi, everyone.
8739134	8741154	This is from Spasmator, by the way.
8741775	8742275	Hi, everyone.
8742315	8747716	Seeing as this is topics and questions may possibly run a little long, I opted to send them via email rather than Twitter.
8748416	8754638	Seeing as it's the end of the year and traditionally everyone seemingly does a top ten list of some sort, why not have OLR and the OLR Army do one?
8755559	8756499	But do one with a twist.
8756899	8760560	What I had in mind was a list of top games that came out this year that you
8761226	8768807	You'd love to have the Hillary Clintons and the Voldemorts of the world be forced to play non-stop for days on end just to drive them all crazy.
8769127	8770828	Well, even crazier than they already happen to be.
8771428	8773888	Also, seeing as the year is virtually over, I have two questions.
8773968	8786831	Compared to 2008, how do you feel about 2009 fared in regards to game releases, sales of both consoles and games, as well as improvements to consoles and or their online services, both in terms of actual hardware revisions or...
8787991	8789872	as well as firmware updates.
8790432	8791593	I have no opinion.
8793294	8794194	It's about the same.
8794394	8795415	I mean, I don't pay.
8795715	8798176	I gotta say, I think 09's been a lot more disappointing than 08.
8798637	8800257	I think we've had a lot of disappointments this year.
8800358	8804740	Games getting pushed back, quality of games, you know, don't seem to be up there.
8804780	8807461	I mean, there's lots of exceptions to this rule, don't get me wrong.
8807481	8813784	Of course, there's been some real gems that have been released this year, but I think layoffs, etc., it's been a lot of disappointment this year.
8813885	8816506	I don't think there's a lot of good that came out of this year.
8818274	8822738	Except for, um, yeah, I got nothing.
8823498	8824199	President Cat.
8824219	8824479	President Cat.
8824499	8826120	That's a good thing that came out this year, that's it.
8826761	8832466	Um, two, and as far as 2010 is concerned, is there anything in particular that's been announced that you three are eagerly awaiting?
8832786	8837049	Do you have any possible predictions for 2010, or at least something you hope to see happen?
8837750	8841493	Um, I hope that, um, we get President Cat.
8843972	8851236	Um, to kind of piggyback on what Loki was ranting about earlier, I would really like to see Nintendo come out at E3 and do the system they should have done last time.
8852537	8855779	I understand that, you know, Wii was, you know, their gamble.
8856079	8857380	Yay for them, they won.
8857960	8868246	I would like to see them kind of take that up to the next level and catch up finally to where their competitors are at as far as the hardcore gamers are concerned, you know, with the HD and the online and all that fun stuff.
8868426	8871487	It's not going to happen, but I'd like, you asked what I want to see.
8872368	8872428	Um,
8875151	8877132	I'm always a big fan of more retro goodness.
8877332	8879972	So I would like to see more retro games coming back.
8880352	8884313	This whole achievements and trophies and cooperative online play.
8884673	8885953	I'm a big fan of all that stuff.
8885993	8894435	I wish the Virtual Console had achievements within it or ways that I could experience all these old games again with friends.
8895995	8901277	As neat as Virtual Console is for some of the great retro games, it feels very lazy to me.
8902097	8903497	It's just an emulator you're paying for.
8906793	8910135	and, to be fair, Xbox 360 has a lot of these games in their arcade, too.
8910175	8911476	I'm not just picking on Nintendo here.
8911876	8921622	A lot of arcade releases on 360, and Microsoft finally put their foot down on this, was just retro stuff that would throw in some achievements and, you know, I just, I don't know, I just would like to see retro games respected.
8921642	8922643	It has been a decent year for retro gaming.
8923283	8925685	I think it has been a decent year, though, for retro gaming already.
8925705	8928006	I mean, because we've gotten certainly a lot of nods.
8928026	8929567	I mean, Bionic Commando and...
8932329	8934931	I really, though, want to see something really innovative.
8935071	8936613	I want to see something really original.
8937834	8939015	I want to see a game.
8939335	8943619	I want to see working designs come back and bring out all the cool stuff from Japan.
8944460	8945020	That's what I want.
8947202	8947883	I'm holding my breath.
8951803	8952523	Is that it for that email?
8952863	8953243	Or is there more?
8954244	8954804	I think that's it.
8955384	8955704	All right.
8955724	8956944	Because, yeah, that's it.
8956964	8960285	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadar.com is the place to send your emails.
8961146	8963686	Now we'll get into the decade a little bit.
8963726	8973109	And I don't want to linger too long on this, but it's interesting that we're getting to the close of another decade here, the O's or whatever we're going to end up calling these in the past.
8973669	8973989	DarkSakura.com
8989716	8991917	Games have kind of evolved with many of you.
8991937	8993538	And of course, not all of our listeners.
8993979	8996840	Heck, the hosts don't fit into that age bracket.
8996860	9000082	I'm considerably older than that, you know, as we all are.
9000142	9003605	But, you know, I realize that that's where a lot of the listener base is.
9004185	9006166	And just how much games have changed.
9006206	9008808	Just to kind of rewind 10 years and show you how far we've come.
9008888	9012050	Here are some of the big things that happened in the year 2000.
9014251	9016653	PlayStation 2 was launched.
9017253	9021759	Nintendo finally sold its 100 millionth Game Boy handheld console.
9030743	9037826	Sega launched SegaNet into the year 2000, and that's when the Dreamcast Championships took off.
9038607	9040168	Some of the games that came out in the year 2000.
9040248	9044110	The Sims came out January 31st of the year 2000.
9044170	9044570	That it did.
9044590	9046131	I think it was almost 10 years old.
9046491	9047911	Thief 2 came out in the year 2000.
9049454	9072069	Vagrant Story, EverQuest came out in the year 2000, Deuce X, Diablo 2 was from the year 2000, that game feels even older, Final Fantasy 9 had a release in Japan in the year 2000, Chrono Cross came out in 2000, Dragon Quest 7, American McGee's Alice,
9073936	9077098	The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask was in the year 2000.
9077198	9080561	What else we also had that year?
9081361	9081942	Seaman.
9082662	9083383	Was that, really?
9083643	9085124	That's not on this list, but probably.
9085665	9087966	Seaman, did they have a lot of Dreamcast stuff on there?
9089607	9091689	Yeah, they account for Dreamcast on this list.
9092262	9096185	I think that, no, Seaman might have either been 2000 or 2001.
9097326	9099989	But yeah, the Dreamcast stuff was all early.
9100509	9113960	Escape from Monkey Island, Tekken Tag Tournament, Final Fantasy 9 got its release over here too, Skies of Arcadia, Banjo-Tooie, here's some Dreamcasts, Grandia 2 came out towards the end of the year 2000.
9114861	9115842	Grandia 2, Power Stone
9137420	9144745	and a completely different generation of video games because the launch of the new generation, if you will, of games didn't really happen until, what about 2005, 2006?
9145286	9149668	I think E3 is when we started hearing about this new round of consoles.
9150169	9154051	And then you go back, I mean, heck, the GameCube just came out in what, like 01?
9154612	9155973	Now we have the Wii.
9156253	9159795	I mean, we've gone through many, many different game systems in this generation.
9159835	9165259	So we would have had that all touched this last 10 years we had the Dreamcast,
9166072	9170894	The PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3, the GameCube, the Wii, the Xbox.
9171094	9174955	Microsoft got into gaming in these past few years, or not even 10 years ago.
9175555	9176756	And the Xbox 360.
9177216	9183518	And then, of course, I'm not even counting handhelds and the countless amounts of those and other one-off systems that came out as well.
9183978	9188840	So it's going to be interesting in the next 10 years, in the next generation, just how far games...
9189620	9191201	Go will probably be another generation.
9191221	9197667	We'll be talking about the PlayStation 4 and other Xboxes and maybe other companies that decide to get into gaming.
9198227	9200269	Or maybe one of these companies will buy another.
9200589	9201030	Who knows?
9201210	9202891	It's going to be very interesting to see what happens.
9203632	9208736	Before we open up the phone calls, and yes, some folks in chat want to point out, OLR started in 2002.
9209597	9214901	So while we didn't exist 10 years ago, we're getting into our 8th year of broadcasting.
9215242	9216243	That's quite some time.
9216283	9217023	It's pretty impressive.
9219232	9220052	What do you guys think?
9220072	9221953	And I know this is a very difficult question.
9221993	9223374	This is a very difficult question.
9223834	9228356	But what do you guys think were some of the best games to come out of the decade?
9228917	9234479	The best games to come out of all freaking decade, knowing that you have all of those systems available to you.
9235020	9239582	Not just maybe what was important to you, but what you think was important to gaming in general.
9240542	9241082	The decade.
9242183	9243163	Loki, want to start?
9243184	9243744	Do you have anything?
9246005	9246105	Um...
9248171	9250892	DDR Max 2 in the arcade.
9251633	9251993	Why is that?
9252793	9253334	It was fun.
9253794	9257236	It got people back in the arcade because you had stuff that you were working to unlock.
9258636	9258977	I don't know.
9259377	9260317	I like Fifth Mix too.
9260597	9263479	That came out around the same time.
9263499	9265140	These were also games that brought us together.
9265220	9266360	We wouldn't have OL Army.
9266540	9270823	As much shit as we give Konami and their music division now, ten years ago was a different story.
9271043	9272343	We praise them.
9272384	9272944	We love them.
9273604	9275005	But they made a lot of mistakes, sadly.
9276587	9277067	Grand Theft Auto 3
9300129	9302371	Marvel vs. Capcom 2 Final Fantasy X Final Fantasy X
9328857	9329438	Only MMO.
9329538	9333621	Well, I played a little Matrix Online, but that sucked.
9335423	9336684	Gosh, yeah, it's tough.
9339006	9343130	DarkSakura, anything you want to throw out there as far as your games of the decade?
9343490	9343870	Portal.
9344791	9345512	Definitely Portal.
9347273	9347714	Seaman.
9349155	9349695	DDR.
9350596	9354219	Well, keep in mind, I got DDR for home in 2000 on Dreamcast.
9357982	9358983	Rod Calibur, Rob.
9359843	9361044	Rod Calibur is important.
9361484	9363866	You remember Rod Calibur, don't you?
9363926	9365627	Yes, that's when you play Soul Calibur with the Rod.
9366028	9366448	Exactly.
9367288	9367909	Rod Calibur.
9370191	9383480	Also, I'd have to say, probably as far as shooters go, I'd say Ikaruga, getting Gradius V. There was a lot of good games that came out, though, in the decade.
9385723	9392824	So, yeah, but I'd really say, well, if I say Portal, I should say Narbacular Drop, because that's really the game that gave us Portal.
9392844	9404447	A lot of people thinking in interesting directions, especially with having the Dreamcast come out, the Naomi system, the Hikaru after that, although I still want Planet Harrier, where is it?
9405927	9409088	It doesn't work, I tried it during the beginning of the show.
9409128	9409548	Damn!
9409808	9411148	Sorry, it still doesn't work in MAME.
9413463	9419666	As far as my answer to the question, I've answered this on another show, but to kind of repeat it here on Orange Lounge Radio, I think I would split it up into a few categories.
9421006	9422387	No, you left yourself on.
9423067	9423307	Sorry.
9424968	9427769	Jamie's trying to have a sidebar conversation with me while I'm trying to talk on the internet.
9428330	9429870	Anyhow, what was I going to say?
9429910	9431231	Oh, yes, the game of the decade.
9431791	9432832	Some things that came up.
9435643	9440966	My personal favorite game of the decade I think was probably Animal Crossing was one I really remember.
9441046	9454214	And I loved how you, you know, as much slack as that game got for running around doing nothing, if you really went far with it where you could like go into somebody else's village, you know, you brought your friend over with a memory card.
9454234	9460858	And I remember we used to do this shit all the time is that somebody would come over and we'd visit the town and try to get their townspeople to say dirty words and all this stuff.
9461198	9462299	It was just a lot of fun.
9462359	9467781	And also the fact that it had all the retro Nintendo games in it before Nintendo started gouging the prices for all this stuff.
9468001	9470282	I just loved that game when it first came out.
9470302	9474904	And it kind of sucks that the game's franchise has been milked through the DS and the Wii versions.
9474924	9476845	It's just not really as fun anymore as it used to be.
9477145	9485529	But that very first Animal Crossing that was on the GameCube in America... Yes, I realize it's based off a Nintendo 64 game, but I'm not counting that because that didn't have an impact on our culture here in the U.S.
9486049	9488871	That first Animal Crossing on the GameCube I think was probably...
9489531	9491433	One of the best gaming experiences I had all decade.
9493535	9502563	As far as on a technical level, I know Loki's going to hate me for this, but I think Wii Sports, you have to recognize, is one of the best games of the decade because it got people to play games who don't play games.
9504065	9506607	You see Wii Sports in nursing homes, for Christ's sake.
9506647	9508729	But we didn't want those people playing games!
9509730	9514975	You still have to recognize, though, that's still money in the gaming industry that can someday make a game you might want to play.
9516058	9521579	No, it won't, because they'll be catering to these people that don't really care about games, but they like Wii Sports.
9521639	9522220	Okay, hold on.
9522680	9531662	But without Wii Sports, and basically the Wii in general, would we have Project Natal and the Sony Ice Cream Cones, which may bring us the games you want to play, Loki?
9532922	9535123	I'm still skeptical on what they're going to bring us.
9535183	9539044	I'm skeptical too, but there is a possibility it could be pretty fucking awesome.
9540302	9540802	World of Warcraft
9553496	9554277	Haters gonna hate.
9554357	9560444	I know there's a lot of people that are anti-MMOs out there, but I think World of Warcraft did amazing stuff for online games.
9560685	9568134	I think the way Blizzard kind of caters to the different audiences, Blizzard is like the best PC game maker.
9568815	9571218	They are.
9571878	9573000	Name a bad Blizzard game.
9577009	9577109	Chirp!
9602408	9602949	Super Mario Galaxy
9629141	9632552	I'm just saying Super Mario Galaxy 2 is not going to be that great.
9636501	9662116	Number 9, Half-Life 2 Definitely I think sometimes a forgotten about game from all of us console hoarding folks but the Orange Box did bring this back to the forefront Half-Life 2 was a hugely important PC game just for the way it integrated story into the shooter game and the graphical level and just the fact that the game you didn't really go from level to level, you were immersed
9662984	9663324	DarkSakura,
9678692	9679213	Thank you for watching!
9697288	9698309	I like this entry.
9698349	9699749	I think this is often overlooked.
9699849	9701670	Number 7, Bejeweled from the year 2001.
9702390	9703431	The original Bejeweled.
9703911	9704491	I can see that.
9704611	9705712	I can totally see that too.
9705752	9711014	And I think a lot of folks forget what PopCap and casual gaming has done for gaming in this decade.
9711054	9712955	I think that's a very important game to note.
9713775	9715696	Number 6, they put Wii Sports.
9715876	9717457	I don't think I need to say anything else with that.
9717977	9719398	Number 5, they put Halo.
9721129	9723750	I don't think the Xbox would have survived if it wasn't for Halo.
9724211	9727672	I think we'd be looking at the Xbox kind of like we look at the Atari Jaguar, honestly.
9728072	9735516	I think Xbox kind of pushed, and especially Halo 2, kind of pushed the Xbox to what ended up happening on the 360.
9736357	9737737	I think Halo was huge.
9741139	9744260	And certainly Yahoo and their video game related site does too.
9744280	9747922	You know, Rob, it's all about Pet Society and Farmville.
9748403	9748803	Yeah.
9750016	9753338	Number four was Guitar Hero, they put on the list.
9753738	9768205	And it's very interesting, having done this as a music game based show, when it was a very niche thing, it's very interesting that we have kind of watched music games explode into the mainstream, and a lot of this is because of Guitar Hero.
9768725	9770106	And they finally did what...
9770526	9783002	Konami should have thought to do a long fucking time ago or excuse me well Konami of Japan should have taken a risk on a long time ago and stopped being so bullheaded when it comes to releasing stuff in the US and that is put in the songs that people in the US want to play
9784091	9791214	and granted, I know those of us here in studio and a lot of our long time listeners were fans of stuff that Konami was putting in those music games a long time ago.
9791594	9795075	But we were a niche audience and those games were never going to break through.
9795115	9798057	Guitar Hero finally broke it through and I think that's important to note.
9798277	9799917	And it debuted in our living room.
9800218	9800838	In my living room.
9801478	9802058	That's right.
9802138	9803879	You guys had like a sneak peek.
9803899	9808321	I wasn't here that day but you and Loki were on the news doing some sneak peek thing with Guitar Hero.
9808361	9808921	I remember that.
9808941	9809541	That was pretty fun.
9809821	9813163	Just because I happen to have a big TV that wouldn't you know
9815324	9816606	had a better refresh rate.
9817306	9821550	I just want to point out a lot of our chatters, because I'm kind of keeping one eye on chat.orangelongerator.com.
9822491	9823252	Some interesting comments.
9823292	9826455	GameGuru, Half-Life 2 also introduced Steam onto the world.
9826835	9828296	That was the first one that had Steam in it.
9828877	9832220	And then quite a few folks yelling out, Pagle, better than Bejeweled.
9833533	9834153	I love Peggle.
9834354	9835154	I do love Peggle too.
9835194	9836175	Especially on iPhone.
9836215	9838056	But I think without Bejeweled, you wouldn't have Peggle.
9838637	9840558	So I can see why they opted to put Peggle on the list.
9840578	9847163	Well, I mean, shoot, without Tetris or Puzzle Bobble, without Plinko, we wouldn't have Peggle.
9848303	9853647	The number three game on Yahoo's list, The Sims, was the most important game of the decade.
9853687	9854328	And you know what?
9854368	9856049	I think The Sims was pretty fucking awesome.
9856089	9858351	It was the best PC-selling game for a long time.
9859412	9860472	Modern Warfare 2 I got nothing
9883988	9886610	Grand Theft Auto 3 was really the first sandbox-y type of game like that, right?
9886750	9889632	And just opened up this whole new type of video game, practically.
9904587	9911070	I have to admit, usually I look at those lists and roll my eyes, but maybe with the exception of Wii Fit, that was a pretty good list, I gotta say.
9911770	9914252	So, see what you guys think about there.
9914972	9916453	Some of our folks in chat disagree.
9916593	9923316	I don't know though, I realize Grand Theft Auto 3 might not be the type of game you play, but think about that whole sandbox type of game.
9923356	9928018	I mean, Grand Theft Auto was really kind of the pioneer in that, and I think without Grand Theft Auto 3, you wouldn't have that.
9929813	9936057	Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and open up our Skype line and see what you guys have to say about the year in gaming and the decade in gaming.
9936397	9938098	And honestly, it's just an open forum tonight.
9938118	9944321	Whatever you guys want to talk about, it's our last show of the decade, so please give us a call.
9944341	9953966	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or you can always reach us on Skype at username OrangeLoungeRadio is the place to call.
9954906	9958388	Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls to come in, do we have any last minute stories, Loki?
9959631	9961512	I haven't been looking at last minute stories.
9962913	9963994	Yeah, I'm sure we do have some.
9964014	9966415	Oh good, you're saved because we have a call coming in right now.
9966435	9967476	So let's go ahead and take this call.
9968156	9969377	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9969417	9969817	Who's this?
9971038	9972158	Hi, this is Actdeft.
9972278	9972859	Hi, Actdeft.
9972879	9973339	How are you doing?
9974660	9975100	Pretty good.
9975500	9979823	Well, we're talking about, of course, the year in games, the decade in games, or really whatever you want to talk about tonight.
9979843	9980283	What's on your mind?
9981618	9988280	Well, first of all, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, a late Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.
9988840	9989480	Same to you.
9990440	9990681	Thanks.
9991501	9993921	And I want to talk about my game of the year.
9994502	9995502	Which is?
9996702	9997762	Forza Motorsport 3.
9999383	10000083	Ah, okay.
10000143	10004344	That hasn't been mentioned yet on the show, but I can see that as somebody's choice.
10004704	10006725	What is it about this game that makes it the game of the year for you?
10009922	10011625	I can explain in only one phrase.
10011705	10014129	It's racing simulation for dummies.
10016332	10018757	And why does that make it game of the year?
10018817	10021842	I mean, Mario Kart Wii is kind of racing simulation for dummies, right?
10023243	10037831	Well, Mario Kart Wii is more like an arcade style of racing, while Forza is more of a simulation like Gran Turismo, where if you make a bad turn, you will crash.
10038491	10043034	If you go too fast, you'll crash, and if you do everything wrong, you'll crash.
10043794	10050458	And not like in Gran Turismo or any other racing game,
10052680	10060843	Your car has damages and possibly, well, not possibly, and it will affect your racing.
10063543	10071866	Is it just the realism in that regard that makes this the game of the year for you or is it like a graphical achievement or what is it that just makes this game so awesome?
10072873	10074154	and many more.
10093993	10103098	in tuning, you can paint it, you can make the stickers or the calls, and make your own car.
10103419	10108501	It's like the teddy bear workshop, but in car form.
10109082	10121349	And like I said, it's a pretty easy game to pick up, because the options let you begin to play, you have a lot of things that help you
10122009	10129152	to race along and complete the challenges and all the tournaments and races you have to compete in.
10129832	10139356	But if you're truly a racing expert, it also has all that other stuff that makes you like the game.
10140456	10142257	It makes a real simulation.
10143973	10147917	All right, well, the only criteria that you really have to use is the type of game that you enjoy.
10148017	10149578	It's just your criteria and no one else's.
10149618	10152141	So if that's your game of the year, then so be it.
10152541	10154943	Well, we appreciate the call and you chiming in on your game of the year.
10154963	10156585	Are there any other quick thoughts you have for us tonight?
10158126	10165373	Well, other than that, I think that also Street Fighter IV is also a candidate for game of the year.
10165914	10167876	A game that offers a studio name, yeah.
10169441	10170622	How do you say it?
10170882	10172863	The rebirth of fighting games.
10174304	10177765	It definitely did energize fighting games in kind of a new way this year.
10177805	10183008	And it's interesting, having played Tekken 6 this week, I feel like Street Fighter 4 did inspire some things in it.
10183468	10183808	We'll see.
10184069	10184589	Yeah.
10185189	10186810	All right, well, thank you so much, Actdeft, for the call.
10186850	10188391	You have a great new year, and be safe, okay?
10189491	10190052	Thanks, you too.
10190192	10190712	All right, later.
10191620	10215993	again if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio we are open and taking some calls and I know the call the phones have been ringing so we're going to wait here and try to get a call when it comes through of course now that I say that nobody's calling in it's like everybody's waiting because they still hear Actdeft on the line oh we got another call coming in hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
10216960	10219681	This is that one across the ocean, Akiripper.
10219941	10221001	Hello, Akiripper!
10221521	10222442	So good to hear from you.
10222482	10223742	How are things in your neck of the woods?
10224822	10225643	It's fun.
10225963	10226903	It's quite fun.
10227243	10230244	We have, like, mostly fun.
10230264	10232505	There's, like, what is it?
10232565	10235426	We have, like, a few feet of snow.
10237126	10239227	And we have, like, well, what is it?
10239807	10246669	Like, 20 minus degrees Celsius for a night, like, around minus something to something degrees.
10248030	10249832	and, well, yay.
10278449	10285093	Game of the year is Sims 3, judging by the amounts that I've played it.
10285854	10287695	What makes Sims 3 your game of the year?
10287735	10292098	I'm sure DarkSakura wouldn't argue with that, but what was it for you that made that game for you?
10294259	10298843	Well, I'm new to this whole Sims game, so to say.
10299083	10305027	Sims 3 was the first Sims game that I really got addicted to.
10306358	10314244	Add to the following fact that I haven't played WoW in almost a year now.
10315245	10320048	So, well, there is that.
10320749	10328655	And then there is the following fact that my computers tend to explode every new MMO release.
10329036	10332759	It happened with Warhammer last year, and it happened with Aeon.
10335101	10343925	and, well, once I get to fix my computers, I have no desire to play any of those MMOs, unfortunately.
10345045	10345745	What do you think it is?
10346166	10355509	You know, we heard a lot this year about ION possibly being the first game that's finally going to really challenge WoW, and then all of a sudden it kind of landed with this big, you know, like it just landed with a thud.
10355889	10359731	You know, why is it that no MMO can take on WoW, you think?
10362057	10376045	In my case, I don't know, since, well, as I said, my computer tends to just die a few weeks after it's been released, or the first week it is released.
10377326	10386711	And, well, there seems to be this unlucky... I have this sudden streak of unluck, and it's quite annoying.
10386731	10387872	Yeah, well.
10390974	10396396	Other mentions, well, on Game of the Year.
10397537	10400658	Shadow Complex and Dragon Age Origins.
10402139	10414645	Even though, Dragon Age Origins, as been said before, because of the only games I play is mostly like The Sims 3,
10417205	10422707	So I can't play, haven't played since Dragon Age Origins that much.
10422927	10427889	Yeah, that's a game that wasn't really mentioned before as a possible Game of the Year contender, and I think definitely a lot of big, big fans of that game, so...
10446887	10457954	Well, other than that, well, other than that, well, on the personal playing, well, this year I actually got a 360, so, well, yay on me.
10458814	10459614	Supposedly so.
10459875	10464357	A lot of people joined in the Xbox 360 Club and the PS3 Club this year, too, with the Slim.
10464857	10470181	Anyway, Akira Ripper, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call and getting in tonight, all right?
10470781	10471721	Yeah, well, later.
10471942	10472502	Have a good new year.
10474482	10475403	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10501471	10504913	Game of the Year Game of the Decade
10521664	10525027	My game of the year definitely was Beatles Rock Band.
10527049	10533435	As DarkSakura knows, because she was at my house visiting in the summer, I am a very, very, very big Beatles fan.
10533455	10545246	So it was nice to get a rock band game that had a lot of songs that I know, as opposed to most of them where I don't know a lot of the songs because I'm an old fart and I only listen to oldies music.
10546479	10546999	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10570871	10574593	It was put together beautifully, too, I think is one of the great things about it.
10574653	10576734	It's just visually, it's a cool game.
10577055	10578315	Dude, that bass was awesome.
10579176	10589722	Yeah, it's really great, and I still like every time that I play through the game and I play the end, there's like one part where Paul starts to sing end in the end, and I'm like, I love you, Paul!
10589802	10590743	It's so great!
10592045	10592385	DarkSakura.com
10607785	10612407	Game of the Decade Game of the Decade Game of the Decade Game of the Decade Game of the Decade
10635042	10637563	Game of the Decade was kind of more difficult.
10637803	10643504	I decided to go with something that came out actually at the beginning of the decade, and that was Diablo 2.
10645045	10646885	We mentioned that in our 2000 list, yeah?
10647425	10659848	Yeah, and I think Diablo 2 definitely paved the way for a lot of the kind of games that we enjoy now, like World of Warcraft, Warcraft 3, things like that.
10660168	10663029	It was just overall a really good game, and
10664585	10665306	I still play that.
10665326	10667547	Yeah, there's still a lot of people playing that.
10667567	10668608	There's still no Diablo 3.
10668948	10670549	There's still a lot of people playing Diablo 2.
10670809	10676112	But it's funny you kind of say that Diablo 2 paved the way for games like WoW because I really do agree.
10676472	10683195	In fact, I used to kind of joke in World of Warcraft that it really should have just been called World of Diablo because that's kind of how it plays.
10684176	10686097	It plays a little more like Diablo than it is Warcraft.
10688174	10704987	but yeah so I mean that was you know like there's so many great games that came out this decade but I think Diablo 2 really paved the way for a lot of other games and it was just overall really you know a good game like I said I still play it so you know if it's a game that you can play 10 years later then that's something worthwhile.
10705752	10708913	I think that's a darn good pick, so I'm not going to argue with you there.
10709633	10713954	Maybe even though I picked something different, I can certainly see where Diablo 2, without that, we would not have had WoW.
10714355	10715935	So it's a very good pick.
10716075	10720176	And Battle.net and this whole infrastructure they had to build for that, too.
10720296	10722317	That's something that's continuing to evolve for them.
10723857	10726358	Well, anything else on your mind tonight before we get to some more calls?
10727227	10727627	I know that's it.
10727647	10732290	I know you guys are ringing off the hook because I've tried calling in a few times before I got through.
10732350	10733791	So I'll go ahead and let you go.
10734192	10736353	And it was nice chatting with you guys again.
10736533	10736853	Thank you.
10736873	10738094	It was very good to chat with you too.
10738194	10740556	I think though that we should take this opportunity though for a plug.
10740985	10741485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10766802	10768228	So something's going on.
10768248	10769674	No, I'm joking, obviously.
10769734	10771040	But what's going on, you guys?
10772432	10783140	Well, we've had our long-running segment of my blog, which is Monday's Comic Mania, and it's just where DarkSakura and I kind of blog about upcoming comics in the week.
10783961	10792487	And so we decided, like last week when I was there, to just kind of play around with the idea of doing a podcast of it, and we got a lot of positive feedback.
10792527	10799132	So we are starting to do that on a regular basis, and we actually did record our second episode today.
10799152	10799232	Okay.
10801232	10802293	It was pretty fun too.
10802994	10805157	So where can they download the podcast if they want to check that out?
10805918	10808862	If they want to check that out, they can go to AvengersTower.com.
10810598	10811398	An Affiliate Program
10833769	10834530	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10850276	10852197	Oh, yeah, you want me to do it after the show tonight.
10852217	10853317	I'll be happy to do that for you tonight.
10853437	10853858	Sure, sure.
10854218	10855038	Well, thank you, guys.
10855178	10855738	No problem.
10856219	10860581	All right, ToaGak in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com, wants us to fight over Dark Sakura.
10860981	10867123	So we will have to settle this in a battle of strip poker, clearly, is the only possible answer.
10867684	10870825	All right, well, we'll make it a date next time that I'm up in Sacramento.
10870845	10872586	That's going to be one hot date, yeah.
10873206	10873746	Maybe.
10874067	10875968	And no, it will not be broadcast on the internet.
10876028	10876249	All right.
10876589	10877930	No, Maren, thank you so much for the call.
10877950	10879551	You take care and have a great new year, okay?
10880112	10880392	You too.
10880432	10880692	Thanks.
10880913	10881153	Later.
10883462	10886863	Bochikawa on chat says they're just trying to bribe me with the introduction speech.
10887303	10888403	All right, let's get to another call.
10888903	10890744	I think this is going to be our last call of the night.
10891184	10895905	And from what I understand, the 1-877 number is not working, and I apologize for that.
10895965	10897125	I don't know what the hell is going on.
10897605	10900886	That would be one of those things I don't find out about until the show starts, so I apologize.
10901326	10903406	Anyhow, Rama, you're on the phone.
10903446	10903766	What's up?
10904686	10907207	Well, you couldn't have an end-of-year show without me, guys.
10908027	10911188	You do seem like a fitting personality to have here at the end of the year.
10911268	10911868	What's on your mind?
10912717	10913397	Not too much.
10913558	10916459	I just wanted to give what I thought was my game of the year.
10917400	10917900	Well, please.
10918020	10918981	What was your game of the year?
10920001	10921802	Ghostbusters, the video game.
10922023	10922963	That was awesome.
10923824	10924764	You know what's funny?
10924784	10925465	Yes, it was.
10926585	10927706	What was it about this game?
10927766	10929107	What made it so goddamn awesome?
10930027	10937031	You know how whenever they do a movie to video game, the video game generally sucks donkey balls.
10937412	10937632	Mm-hmm.
10938544	10957396	Ghostbusters the video game is one of those shining gems where it came out really good granted it's not really based off the movie on the same token it's like a sequel to the first two movies but you still kind of go through elements of the first two movies as you play the game which I thought was fun
10959760	10961962	Game of the Year Game of the Year
10989946	10990367	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
11008828	11009668	Game of the Decade.
11009749	11010669	I know, this is so much.
11012351	11012931	Wow.
11013892	11016774	I don't think I can really pinpoint a Game of the Decade.
11017074	11018255	I don't think I really could.
11018275	11020237	I'd actually have to sit there and think about that.
11021107	11029050	You know, I don't think a lot of people can truly, even though we read this list off of Yahoo and so forth and said, you know, they did a pretty good job, at least of where to start.
11029490	11035053	I don't think you will truly be able to know what the biggest games of the decade were until about five years from now.
11035533	11040635	When you're really able to accurately look back and say, okay, what games really shaped where we're at now?
11040955	11043696	You can kind of do that a little bit with the earlier games in the decade.
11043736	11048298	For instance, we were having a chat earlier about how Diablo 2 ultimately shaped World of Warcraft.
11048618	11049559	You know, I think...
11050659	11051640	It'll be interesting to see.
11052701	11060086	If some of these things like Natal and the Sony ice cream cone fail, then you can say that maybe Wii Sports wasn't as big as we thought it was.
11060126	11061668	Maybe it really was just a flash in the pan.
11061948	11065931	But if these two things blow up, then it kind of adds value to Wii Sports in a way.
11066923	11067463	Pretty much.
11067763	11074606	I mean, I can't really say on the PC side of things with Diablo because I grew up mostly doing console gaming.
11075006	11079488	And I had a PC, but nothing worthy of playing half these games that are out there.
11079528	11084270	And when I saw some of these games in the store, I was always drawn towards the console games.
11086051	11089132	Yeah, and that's a lot of people in that same boat.
11089152	11091013	There's a lot of people also the exact opposite.
11091033	11092434	They just can't get into the consoles.
11092494	11095795	They have to play on the PC with the keyboard and the mouse or it just doesn't work.
11097054	11098815	It's one of the reasons why I don't play Halo.
11101017	11101297	All right.
11101557	11104559	Well, Ranma, you're going to be the last call of the year.
11104979	11106981	Do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
11107341	11108201	Yeah, a couple of things.
11108381	11113785	Number one, a few episodes back, you had mentioned whatever happened to TradeWest.
11114646	11114906	Yes.
11116767	11121330	I think a couple of years after they did Double Dragon, they were acquired by Midway.
11122612	11123233	Oh, okay.
11123473	11123773	Alright.
11123993	11128517	So they're pretty much no more, is my assumption.
11128697	11129378	Sure, sure.
11129458	11133421	And that makes sense, because I want to say Midway did some Double Dragon games later on, so that makes total sense.
11134002	11134222	Yeah.
11135603	11142169	And last thing I'll leave this note on to you, Jamie, Matt, thank you.
11143536	11144177	You're welcome.
11144217	11144737	You're welcome.
11145157	11145838	No, really.
11145958	11150941	I mean, I tune in every Sunday to listen to you guys talk about gaming.
11150981	11157426	And from time to time, you guys move off of gaming, talk about stuff in your personal lives, which do affect all of us.
11157826	11165492	And I like the fact that we can come together as a family and discuss some of these things like Proposition 8 and so forth.
11166072	11168054	That was something I really appreciate.
11168874	11170876	It was like that one time, you know,
11171897	11185734	deviate from the gaming talk about something that's more important more of an impact in our lives that we need to discuss and see how we all feel about that so that's something I appreciate and you know what thank you
11186962	11187623	Thank you very much.
11187723	11192107	It makes us feel very good about what we do, certainly.
11193508	11195429	I know that sometimes I'm kind of joking.
11195569	11198892	Sometimes my role on the show is to try and make sure we get back to the games at some point.
11199353	11203696	Obviously, I've certainly, with some of the things you mentioned, kind of gone astray myself.
11204217	11206538	And I'm really thankful that the audience...
11207359	11208640	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
11226548	11235610	is astounding and it's been something that's kind of grown through this whole decade and it's going to continue on over the next few... We are the LL Army.
11235870	11236310	That's right.
11236970	11246832	It's like, you know, at first I felt like I should be kind of offended that you're bringing in personal stuff but then I realized if you guys don't talk about it and bring it up, who is?
11246972	11248553	I mean, we all listen to you guys.
11248913	11251573	You're like the voice of gaming to us.
11251613	11254874	You know, we're like one giant happy mafia family.
11255819	11259024	Oh God, don't put that responsibility on us or we might get scared.
11260085	11262088	I've already got a whole back full of tattoos now.
11262622	11263823	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11289281	11289781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11312793	11313754	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
11330253	11330833	DarkSakura.com
11354449	11355349	We want you to come back and see us too.
11383600	11408671	Fanime was a blast I'm planning on it and working on bringing Jodea, Misty I'm working on it one way or another even if that means I gotta pack them in boxes and ship them Metal Gear Solid Snake style we'll be there for the 4th of July I'm actually wanting to get to New York I would love to find my way up there sometime
11409791	11413792	You know, it's been since I was 17 years old was the last time.
11414052	11415273	The one and only time, I think.
11415993	11418774	No, I went once when I was an infant, so therefore I don't remember it.
11419154	11421435	But that was the last time I went to New York.
11422735	11424276	Look at it this way, Amy.
11424316	11428097	If you come out here, Patty's has a room just for you.
11428137	11429618	The bed is ready and everything.
11429878	11432238	It says DarkSakura's guest room right there.
11432599	11432739	Really?
11432759	11433559	It's just looking for you.
11434528	11436469	So who's got 400 bucks I can borrow, huh?
11436669	11438670	Sister Act's supposed to be on Broadway this next year.
11438690	11439790	I'm coming out there to see that.
11439830	11440231	You know that.
11440631	11440871	All right.
11440891	11443592	Hey, Ranma, this is also going on the longest call of the decade.
11443612	11445553	So I have to say thank you.
11445673	11446073	I'm sorry.
11446133	11447314	No, it was all worth it.
11447374	11447694	Thank you.
11447734	11448474	Have a wonderful night.
11448514	11450515	And thank you for being a longtime supporter of the show.
11450535	11451316	We really appreciate it.
11451676	11454337	And really a lot of people that called in tonight were in that same boat.
11454397	11455037	So thank you, Ranma.
11455197	11455477	Take care.
11456138	11456498	Take care.
11458215	11459977	Again, apologies to those that didn't get through.
11460418	11464102	And apologies that the 877 number apparently was borked and I was unaware.
11464683	11465644	I didn't do that on purpose.
11465784	11468267	Apologize to you guys who weren't able to get through because of that.
11469048	11470469	But we are going to leave it at that note.
11470549	11472291	Of course we'll be back here next week.
11472912	11473513	We always are.
11473993	11474754	To do it all again.
11474814	11475535	Take more calls.
11475595	11476356	Do more emails.
11476456	11476977	Do it again.
11477898	11478198	Until...
11479324	11481505	Our lives change and we're just not able to do it anymore.
11481945	11482825	Don't know when that's going to be.
11482845	11484106	I don't want to focus on that right now.
11484526	11490829	Let's just focus on what a great decade it's been for video games and it's just going to continue to grow and who knows what the future holds.
11491069	11491769	It's going to be crazy.
11492569	11495511	Well, it's that part of the show where we go around to get everybody's final thoughts.
11495611	11497471	Actually, quickly, are there any last minute stories?
11497511	11499072	I forgot to have Loki clear those out.
11499232	11501154	Just really quickly, stupid things.
11501634	11505518	Like I mentioned before, Dark Void coming out from Capcom.
11505638	11512243	There is also going to be a DSi game coming out as well for Dark Void that's being done in the 8-bit retro style.
11512664	11515586	And it's going to be kind of a side-scroller game, so that's going to be pretty awesome.
11515867	11517228	That'll be out in January for $5.
11518008	11518509	Does look neat.
11519677	11520698	Aliens vs Predators
11534372	11537974	Prinny is getting a sequel on the PSP, Prinny 2.
11539074	11545778	And it's about, apparently, you have to reclaim Etna's stolen underwear.
11545858	11550700	Yes, the game is actually called Prinny 2, Dawn of the Great Pantsu War.
11552901	11554462	And I'll be out in Japan on March 25th.
11554682	11555082	Pantsu?
11555843	11556083	Yes.
11557624	11558244	That's all I had.
11558344	11561806	Oh, and apparently, and I read this and just said...
11563289	11565632	That's stupid, but hey, I'll add it to the show roll.
11567234	11573021	Apparently, John Gosselin's Wii was stolen.
11573982	11578908	Who gives a shit about that douchebag?
11580143	11586168	Let him go to the cemetery of news people we just don't care about anymore.
11586789	11588590	He is no longer relevant.
11588770	11589211	Bam.
11589591	11589972	Done.
11591153	11593334	Who cares that he had a Wii that got stolen?
11593394	11594275	Well, sorry.
11594696	11599019	Sorry, there's also a free New Year's theme for Xbox Live, so you can download that.
11599179	11599720	Yippee skippee.
11600020	11604344	But look, who cares about some a-hole in his Wii?
11604364	11605205	Just forget it.
11606488	11609790	Although I don't think people should steal things even if the guy is a douchebag.
11609830	11612051	But now when you steal it, people just report on it.
11612091	11614713	So now you've done a double bad thing by stealing his Wii.
11616114	11618795	Anyhow, I don't mean to end this on a negative note.
11618855	11619376	Damn you, Loki.
11620296	11622598	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
11624118	11625039	Loki, your final thought.
11625699	11629882	My final thought is I need to install more games on my main cabinet.
11632318	11636102	My final thought is I hope I get enough sleep because I gotta go back to work tomorrow.
11636263	11637244	Boo.
11637404	11637905	Tanaro.
11638606	11639667	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11643572	11646095	I only have three words, Rob.
11647276	11648418	Reject false icons.
11649264	11650385	A very lovely thought to end on.
11651285	11658630	Guys, don't forget about Orange Lounge Revolution's second mix, the awesome tribute project that's out there that our fans put together.
