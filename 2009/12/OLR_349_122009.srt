1
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,366
[SPEAKER_12]: and I, December 20th, 2009.

2
00:00:16,107 --> 00:00:19,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Is a leaked survey hinting at a paid PlayStation Network?

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Home gets assaulted with new content.

4
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:24,542
[SPEAKER_12]: And what video game related show will soon be on PBS?

5
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:32,027
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

6
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:52,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm alright.

7
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:54,582
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little irritated.

8
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:55,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to hear that.

9
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:56,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at me.

10
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:57,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I do something?

11
00:00:57,943 --> 00:01:00,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I was just saying, if I ruffled your feathers, I'm extremely sorry.

12
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:04,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the show hasn't really started yet, so maybe at the end of the show you'll be mad at me.

13
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:05,045
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

14
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:08,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try not to, though.

15
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:11,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and of course, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

16
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:12,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

17
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:13,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's chowing down on wings right now.

18
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:14,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

19
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:15,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Barbecue wings.

20
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:16,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Been craving them all week.

21
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:17,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you really?

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the whole room smells like barbecue, and damn, I am hungry.

23
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:21,171
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

24
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:23,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll get a taco after the show.

25
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:24,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

26
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:26,770
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me feel a lot better to know at least you're having yummy food.

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,950
[SPEAKER_04]: How have you been, Loki?

28
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:28,790
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been fine.

29
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:50,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Game of the Decade Game of the Decade Game of the Decade

30
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,092
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

31
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,163
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is really down with the Call of Duties of the world.

32
00:02:58,669 --> 00:02:59,029
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

33
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:27,218
[SPEAKER_10]: We played Super Mario Wii, which was pretty cool, if annoying, playing multiplayer.

34
00:03:27,798 --> 00:03:30,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I just found the multiplayer aspect to be really irritating.

35
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,180
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wasn't fun for me that way.

36
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,283
[SPEAKER_10]: And a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, which if you ignore the whole Civil War storyline, it's actually a really fun game.

37
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:43,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I hated the Civil War storyline, so...

38
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:51,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad you finally got around to that, because I know we were talking on last week's show, kind of joking, and I still haven't played this game, but I'm glad you finally were able to do it.

39
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we played a decent bit of it.

40
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:53,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

41
00:03:54,083 --> 00:04:11,413
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played, of course, my Peggle a bunch, and some Solitaire, and Dan was showing us the whole zombie thing in Borderlands and doing the brain hunting thing.

42
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:22,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And, like, it's kind of funny because the more... You have to go back... You, like, find this... One of the character's buddies who's been turned into a zombie and he's tied to his chair so you have to bring him brains to eat.

43
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,103
[SPEAKER_10]: And he keeps asking for more brains.

44
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:29,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So as you... You start bringing him, you know, 10 brains and 25 and 50.

45
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:36,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And as it keeps going, the... It goes brains for the name of the thing.

46
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,090
[SPEAKER_10]: And... But I really...

47
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,052
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

48
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:05,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bummer there's not a game like that on the DS where everybody can kind of do their own thing on their own screen, but yet maybe you're still working together.

49
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:09,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's that real element that you're stuck on that screen.

50
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's both a blessing and a curse.

51
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:17,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that is it for your gaming week... Oh yeah, and I played some World of Warcraft.

52
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:18,804
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

53
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Then how about the one and only Techmaster Loki?

54
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:23,567
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't play a whole lot this week.

55
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:27,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Not as much as I'd want to, finishing up Christmas gifts and stuff.

56
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:35,876
[SPEAKER_13]: So I played Grand Theft Auto, Ballet Gay Tony, multiplayer.

57
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:37,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Kicking ass...

58
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:38,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

59
00:05:54,383 --> 00:06:00,246
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you just pretty much just join a, you know, ranked deathmatch game, you're probably going to get into ours.

60
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:09,631
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, it's funny because we laugh at the people that play with us because most of the time they end up dropping because we're just so intense in the game.

61
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:15,255
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, not that we're talking trash to them, we don't have microphones or anything, but we just kick the crap out of everybody.

62
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:22,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Mainly, I kick the crap out of everybody, but, you know, there's a little bit coming my way, but it's funny.

63
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:23,099
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um...

64
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,090
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

65
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, other than that, I've played more Bayonetta, and it's awesome.

66
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:32,673
[SPEAKER_13]: I like some of the stuff later on in the game.

67
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:37,874
[SPEAKER_13]: You can actually buy new techniques and stuff, and one of the techniques I unlocked is like a windmill.

68
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:44,716
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like the breakdancing move, so you spin around with the guns blazing on your feet or whatever, and then she stops and does a freeze pose.

69
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:46,297
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.

70
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:49,018
[SPEAKER_13]: This game is awesome.

71
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm so excited.

72
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:51,819
[SPEAKER_13]: And then...

73
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:54,685
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

74
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:13,203
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't that big a deal to me.

75
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:13,824
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

76
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:24,567
[SPEAKER_13]: I played that game, so it's kind of like a hovercraft action game or something like that where you're blowing up other robotic hovercrafts and stuff, and it was neat for a little bit.

77
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:25,628
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

78
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,129
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's not something I'd consistently play.

79
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:30,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, um...

80
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:54,695
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

81
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,255
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be cool.

82
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:32,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see, my gaming week, obviously, if you were listening to last week's show, I got that awesome FC Mobile as a gift for the holidays.

83
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:37,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went out on a little bit of a binge and I bought some 8B games and I borrowed from the vault.

84
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:45,557
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had NES games galore back at home, including an awesome purchase I made at a local games store.

85
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:48,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to where you suggested, Jamie, and I don't know if I told you what I got there.

86
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I did after last week, but I went to that store we talked about.

87
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it your game?

88
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:52,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

89
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to say it on air or not.

90
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:55,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

91
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I went and got Goonies 2 on the NES.

92
00:08:58,425 --> 00:08:58,885
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fun.

93
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a game I just remember.

94
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:08,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't spectacular, I think, when it came out, but I think it was also underrated because a lot of people said, what the hell does this have to do with a movie?

95
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:09,715
[SPEAKER_04]: But it actually was a pretty cool game.

96
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:12,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I also bought Slipheed for the Sega CD, which I knew...

97
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,060
[SPEAKER_04]: and Sylphid.

98
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:39,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times!

99
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Good 8-bit times

100
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:22,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, as far as my gaming week goes, not a whole lot of other new stuff.

101
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:25,498
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of World of Warcraft, a little bit of DJ Hero.

102
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that earlier in the week and got some trophies.

103
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I really like DJ Hero.

104
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,900
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorite games to have come out this year.

105
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't understand why people are like, why it's cool to hate on DJ Hero all of a sudden.

106
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:42,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Because maybe it's not selling zillions of copies like Guitar Hero and Rock Band do.

107
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:48,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think a lot of this came from those silly VGA awards that happened.

108
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:48,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it last week?

109
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:51,166
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Hero won best music game over the Rock Band Beatles

110
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:11,043
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

111
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have given it to DJ Hero too, and I think a lot of people like

112
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know what I say?

113
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:48,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Haters to the left because you ain't right.

114
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:13,703
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

115
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that pretty much does it for our gaming weeks.

116
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,081
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of housekeeping tonight.

117
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:41,642
[SPEAKER_04]: We have actually some big news in housekeeping.

118
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:44,244
[SPEAKER_04]: First, the little yet important things out of the way.

119
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,426
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not following us on Twitter, please do.

120
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:49,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR is our Twitter feed.

121
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:51,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't have us friended on Facebook...

122
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

123
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio all run together.

124
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:56,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Join our Facebook.

125
00:12:56,854 --> 00:13:00,978
[SPEAKER_04]: We're up to something like 230 friends on Facebook and that's just not even a month.

126
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:01,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much.

127
00:13:02,219 --> 00:13:05,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand people have been spreading the word to friends and all that.

128
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:12,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys so much to everyone who's contributed to that and helping spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because, you know, we do do this show for free.

129
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:16,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of spreading the word, how awesome is this?

130
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:17,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The community.

131
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:22,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself, Jamie, Matt, we have nothing to do with this, honestly.

132
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we didn't help with this.

133
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:26,037
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't contribute to this.

134
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:28,958
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll be damned if we don't love this and support this.

135
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:32,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is this OLR Revolution second mix.

136
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:34,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you guys are familiar with this.

137
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been on the front of our site, and I think it came up last week.

138
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this DDR Stepmania skin mix.

139
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:41,862
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

140
00:13:57,723 --> 00:14:01,688
[SPEAKER_04]: and have put them into this DDR step mania thing.

141
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:09,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess John or DMN from Under Station Live did all the announcer voices because, you know, when Orange Launch Radio was a station, that show was on our station.

142
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's certainly a part of the OLR family too.

143
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:13,924
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just this whole thing that...

144
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:16,026
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

145
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:59,401
[SPEAKER_04]: VGA award winning type of game here I mean it is there's some very silly things in there I've seen some of the videos on the YouTube channel that they have I believe it's OL Revolution some of the YouTubes they have up I have to admit I've been given an advance copy of the game but because I was out of town this weekend I didn't get a chance to check it out so sorry but I did watch the videos and just looking at some of the songs that are in it I'm face palming because they found shit that I did

146
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:04,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Live, where I would sing along to songs because I was that bored.

147
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:08,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what was funny back in 2002 when we were first learning how to broadcast.

148
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:12,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody saved that shit and is now in this game.

149
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:13,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how embarrassing.

150
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:16,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And your karaoke.

151
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Your old karaoke.

152
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I should not be in karaoke.

153
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:20,512
[SPEAKER_04]: God, if Like A Prayer showed up in there, I'm going to die.

154
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:20,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

155
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:21,472
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

156
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:23,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

157
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki is Like A Prayer in there.

158
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:25,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it is.

159
00:15:25,754 --> 00:15:26,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck!

160
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:27,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I found the video for it.

161
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:27,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck!

162
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Like seriously?

163
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I should not be encouraging people to seek this out.

164
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:32,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

165
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:36,800
[SPEAKER_13]: The time that you guys wanted to do the funny stuff again.

166
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember we tried to get me to sing karaoke again?

167
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,064
[SPEAKER_13]: So Oops I Did It Again is in there as well.

168
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:43,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

169
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:46,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm sure we all have a little bit of embarrassment in there.

170
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:48,410
[SPEAKER_04]: But okay, whatever.

171
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I can look past the silliness and the fact that you know what?

172
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:56,317
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing it because somebody thought it was cool as dumb as it was.

173
00:15:57,058 --> 00:15:58,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And they made a game out of it.

174
00:15:58,098 --> 00:15:58,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's awesome.

175
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's such like...

176
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:14,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And as individuals who have been doing this for free for going on eight years now and not really seeing any money out of this, in fact, oftentimes losing a lot of money into this, that's like total reward right there.

177
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:17,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys so much to the community and everybody that put that together.

178
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:22,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand it is coming out Christmas Eve, so stay tuned, 12-24 of 09 to Orange Lounge Radio.

179
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're putting the finishing touches on that right now.

180
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:30,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much to the community for putting that together.

181
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,811
[SPEAKER_04]: We might get some phone calls on that later.

182
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:36,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I got to tell earlier in the show about one of the developers behind it is going to call in and tell us all about it.

183
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:38,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we'll find out some more.

184
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:42,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's all I have for housekeeping.

185
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:43,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.

186
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:47,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get into the news tonight, but first I want to talk about this.

187
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this didn't make the show roll tonight because...

188
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:57,456
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura and Loki really kind of did things because I was out this weekend.

189
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks to everybody for picking up the slack because I wasn't here.

190
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:08,499
[SPEAKER_04]: But I saw something on the internet literally in the 15 minutes I was home between the time I got back from LA and the time I came over to do Orange Lingerie tonight that pissed me off.

191
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,659
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously I didn't make the short roll because the others didn't know about it.

192
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:18,681
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to say something about it because I'm so angry at this that I have to say something about it.

193
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:46,917
[SPEAKER_04]: and it has to do with something I actually saw on Kotaku but it's not Kotaku I'm mad at in fact I think they're great there's lots of great video game blogs out there that I check regularly as I'm sure most of you do and Kotaku's one of them and when I was home for a few minutes I checked the site in my reader and saw that they had just run a story about Out Magazine's Gayest Games Ever list or I think the actual name of the list is the Gayest Video Games that they've put together this list that is running on Out Magazine um

194
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:54,264
[SPEAKER_04]: very little journalistic content to this nobody signed the article so I don't know who did it

195
00:17:55,545 --> 00:18:11,372
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you read it you can pretty much figure out why I really shouldn't be encouraging you to seek this out because this list is not only stupid but it's so stupid it's offensive I am offended by this article you want to know why?

196
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:23,798
[SPEAKER_04]: listen to such gem excerpts such as this the gayest video games obviously I can't read the entire article because it's copyright but for purposes of criticism I can cite certain pieces of it

197
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:26,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Brothers makes the list.

198
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:31,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Which they put a video of Super Mario Brothers 3, but they describe Super Mario Brothers.

199
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleaning pipes and taking names.

200
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:38,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

201
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:42,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Because cleaning pipes is like a euphemism for gay sex?

202
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:43,864
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny.

203
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:46,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

204
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:47,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on with this.

205
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:48,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra.

206
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:54,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Two bare-chested dudes on a mission neither can accomplish without the other.

207
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:59,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Widely thought to have influenced Annie Prolix before she penned this short story to Brokeback Mountain.

208
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's so funny.

209
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:08,436
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, Dan's beaten the game with one guy and no continues.

210
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:09,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So, bullshit.

211
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:10,331
[SPEAKER_04]: BurgerTime

212
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:24,416
[SPEAKER_04]: What?!

213
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, BurgerTime is apparently a gay video game.

214
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:44,990
[SPEAKER_04]: The slap some meat between those buns tagline was jettisoned for the less memorable Let's Get Cooking, but this 1982 arcade title was created as a witty and fun commentary on the closeted state of male-to-male sexuality in the early 1980s.

215
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,411
[SPEAKER_10]: No it wasn't.

216
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,653
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about a fucking hamburger!

217
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:51,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

218
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

219
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:52,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

220
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,132
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

221
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:26,182
[SPEAKER_04]: sets back what we've tried to accomplish by going back to these schoolyard tactics of, well, if X and Y is true, then teehee, you must be gay because so-and-so talks with a lisp.

222
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:27,262
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a faggot.

223
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how many times I had to hear that growing up?

224
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:33,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you're doing in this magazine article, is that any better?

225
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:37,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're bare-chested dudes going on an adventure together.

226
00:20:37,685 --> 00:20:40,126
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes this a gay video game.

227
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I find that to be offensive.

228
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:58,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowhere here in this article does it talk about Dragon Age, a game where you can have a same gender relationship if you want, or not, your choice, or how about what I consider to be one of the most landmark games for homosexual content ever made, The Sims.

229
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,754
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to have a gay relationship, go for it.

230
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:04,416
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't, don't.

231
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,658
[SPEAKER_04]: What you do in your walls is your choice.

232
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that game come up in this article?

233
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,261
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

234
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:15,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to some junior high school graduate here, it's apparently not funny.

235
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:21,694
[SPEAKER_04]: But putting a list of games in a blender that are apparently popular and finding... It's like...

236
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:23,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Jake Gyllenhaal must be gay

237
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:56,505
[SPEAKER_04]: because he bottomed for Heath Ledger or he looks good without a shirt off or whatever reason they pick up.

238
00:21:57,246 --> 00:22:05,254
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that any better from what you've faced as a homosexual man or a bisexual man or somebody in the minority your entire life?

239
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:07,877
[SPEAKER_04]: How is what you're saying any better than that?

240
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:10,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you do one thing, you must be gay.

241
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:12,744
[SPEAKER_04]: This list is stupid.

242
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:16,225
[SPEAKER_04]: This list has nothing to do with gay people.

243
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:18,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It has nothing to do with video games.

244
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:20,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insulting and I denounce it.

245
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:33,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are a gay man listening to this show, which I've been blessed amongst the seven or eight years to meet many gay people that listen to this show and have said many nice things about what we do here and all that stuff, you should be fucking pissed too.

246
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:40,709
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are a straight man who plays video games, you should be fucking pissed at this because they don't know what the hell they're talking about.

247
00:22:41,900 --> 00:23:07,359
[SPEAKER_04]: and Out Magazine if you want to write about video games then hire someone who knows what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to video games and has the balls to sign their articles and has the balls to sign their article and is going to sign a check that they're asking cash no pun intended it's just ridiculous I mean my god if Cho and Niki had been on the list at least I could see that I mean I would think that's a little stupid but come on

248
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:10,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, Loki, am I crazy?

249
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:11,004
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're not crazy.

250
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:15,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that magazine, though, just for men, specifically?

251
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:15,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Out magazine?

252
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:16,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

253
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:17,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't subscribe.

254
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:22,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear it's been around forever, but clearly you can understand why I'm not going to subscribe to these types of magazines.

255
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,433
[SPEAKER_10]: As a woman, I'm actually kind of offended by that, too.

256
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:34,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Out is specifically targeted at gay men, but I'm sure they're not going to say no to a lesbian who wants to buy it.

257
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:44,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I just... I think that that's completely baffling and silly that they could even pass something like that and think that it would be actually funny.

258
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:50,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can't... Now, if the whole list is strictly for parody, it should say parody.

259
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:52,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe it might be remotely funny.

260
00:23:53,826 --> 00:24:00,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It still would be about as funny as... It would be about as funny as World War II.

261
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:01,549
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not funny.

262
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:03,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to play devil's advocate.

263
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

264
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:09,512
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be the only thing that I could remotely see something like that maybe passing to be posted.

265
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:17,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that they go, oh no, this is satire, this is parody, this is us making fun of other people by sort of the Colbert action, you know what I mean?

266
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,955
[SPEAKER_10]: How he makes fun of Republicans by acting like an uber-Republican.

267
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:26,176
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, if there's no type of disclaimer about that, then no.

268
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:26,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that

269
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:31,772
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, actually, I would say don't just post a comment on there.

270
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:35,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, get their address and mail something in.

271
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:36,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see.

272
00:24:37,054 --> 00:24:38,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for sake, real quick.

273
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:41,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're pushed for time tonight, but I just want to read what I said on the article.

274
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:42,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you may not see this.

275
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:45,377
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see this, then they let it run.

276
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,798
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll post it up on our forums, too.

277
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:54,551
[SPEAKER_04]: As a gay man and a long time gaming enthusiast, I find this meat compilation to be not only horribly misinformed but offensive.

278
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:58,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowhere on this list are games mentioned that actually meant anything to gay representation in games.

279
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:00,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Love who you want to love in The Sims.

280
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:02,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Choose to have a same gender night of Passion and Dragon Age.

281
00:25:02,978 --> 00:25:03,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not.

282
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:10,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even a freaking bone-tossed controversial gay content in games such as the hidden kiss in Bully or the lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect.

283
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:11,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

284
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:43,624
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm mad because I'm so disappointed.

285
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:45,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so disappointed.

286
00:25:46,626 --> 00:26:01,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure whoever wrote this article, you know, assuming they're gay, hell, assuming they're straight working in a gay magazine at some point in their life has had a stereotype passed on to them and to just turn around and post this crap in the face of that is disappointing.

287
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:03,180
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's so disappointing that I'm angry.

288
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:08,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Out, do the right thing and renounce this article and apologize.

289
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:09,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I demand it.

290
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,702
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you demand it too, which you should, out.com and I don't know.

291
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I could read the whole... Call for a boycott until you do.

292
00:26:20,063 --> 00:26:23,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to the website and tell someone you're pissed because I know I'm pissed.

293
00:26:24,986 --> 00:26:25,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

294
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:29,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I will send this letter to the editor.

295
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:29,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

296
00:26:29,728 --> 00:26:32,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf says in chat I would send this letter to the editor.

297
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:33,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I should.

298
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:33,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

299
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,890
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens tomorrow.

300
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember...

301
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:50,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I think whether or not it's posted, you should still send it to the editor because keep in mind, what's one of the big things that I personally lead by is that if you don't bring something to the attention of someone who can do something about it, then it's just going to keep going on.

302
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:51,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fair enough.

303
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:52,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what I'll do.

304
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:54,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I will write a letter to the editor.

305
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,682
[SPEAKER_04]: If all of you who are just as pissed off as I am will write a letter to the editor too.

306
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think you should write it despite everything, but I mean, I'll write one.

307
00:27:02,243 --> 00:27:03,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to encourage everyone.

308
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:05,465
[SPEAKER_10]: No, everyone.

309
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:06,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll write one.

310
00:27:07,086 --> 00:27:07,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

311
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:16,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, then we have a cause This is a much more important cause than President Cat, might I add But President Cat's pretty damn important President Cat is pretty damn awesome

312
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:19,232
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

313
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:52,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra being an inspiration for Brokeback Mountain.

314
00:27:52,315 --> 00:27:52,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

315
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:55,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, the book was written?

316
00:27:55,276 --> 00:28:00,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the book was probably written before that game ever came out.

317
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:01,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

318
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to find out.

319
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,980
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it's just ridiculous.

320
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridiculous.

321
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:07,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely ridiculous.

322
00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:13,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I was in band and I played softball for a little while.

323
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,336
[SPEAKER_04]: A question in the chat room.

324
00:28:15,356 --> 00:28:17,918
[SPEAKER_04]: What about bisexuals or pansexuals or asexuals?

325
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who hates stereotypes should be offended by this article.

326
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:28,365
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you hate bisexual stereotypes, you know, like bisexual are just bisexual because they're sluts.

327
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:29,545
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a stereotype.

328
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:30,966
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I get.

329
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:33,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Asexuals are asexual because they can't get any.

330
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:34,629
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a stereotype.

331
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:38,073
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the stuff that I get.

332
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:42,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm married, but I've had girlfriends in the past.

333
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,562
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like, oh, you're married now, so you're not.

334
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,044
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't change.

335
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,067
[SPEAKER_10]: It just means I found someone I fell in love with.

336
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:52,809
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't change anything.

337
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm totally pissed off by that.

338
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,781
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

339
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:12,757
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

340
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:29,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Loki?

341
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:55,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

342
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:57,137
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

343
00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:58,477
[SPEAKER_04]: He has meat.

344
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,378
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was going to let you do gaming news.

345
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to say it.

346
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:01,958
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's fine.

347
00:30:01,978 --> 00:30:04,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just like, I didn't really have anything to contribute.

348
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:06,060
[SPEAKER_13]: It's stupid.

349
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,161
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw the article, you know, when I was looking for stories.

350
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:12,762
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, eh, no list.

351
00:30:12,862 --> 00:30:13,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Boop.

352
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:14,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Skipped right past it.

353
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:15,863
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's pretty much, you know.

354
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:18,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Real Gaming News Real Gaming News Real Gaming News

355
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:52,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, let's start things off with Out Magazine's top gay games list.

356
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh wait, no.

357
00:30:55,222 --> 00:31:07,112
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, as rumored and as we've been talking about before, the water expansion for LittleBigPlanet is going to be hitting the PlayStation Network before Christmas.

358
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:12,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is coming out this week and to kind of tie with it, and I'm surprised I didn't think of it before...

359
00:31:14,144 --> 00:31:14,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Pirates of the Caribbean Level Pack

360
00:31:30,874 --> 00:31:49,579
[SPEAKER_13]: and those will be out on the PlayStation Network on the 22nd including with that will be a six pack of Pirates costumes including Jack Sparrow, Davy Jones, Will Turner and some of the other characters in the actual movie and also you get a free cannibal costume as well if you don't want to buy any of that stuff.

361
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,300
[SPEAKER_13]: At the very least you get a free cannibal costume and I can't wait to buy this.

362
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad after such a sad, angry news item that we have something that makes me happy again.

363
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:03,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And this makes me happy that LittleBigPlanet is still getting some love all this time later.

364
00:32:03,764 --> 00:32:05,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this has been sprinkled throughout the past few shows.

365
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:07,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it weird that this game's a year old?

366
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:13,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And I seriously think LittleBigPlanet has come up every show for like the past month leading up to this, the release of this unpack.

367
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:14,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's going to be awesome.

368
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:18,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to see how water's going to change the game, especially in the fan levels.

369
00:32:18,951 --> 00:32:22,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't get me wrong, the Pirates levels are probably going to be awesome because the Metal Gear Solid levels...

370
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,394
[SPEAKER_04]: That was some of the best bargain DLC.

371
00:32:25,895 --> 00:32:28,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It was almost like playing a new game for seven, eight bucks.

372
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to see what this is going to bring.

373
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:32,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely.

374
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:35,221
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's going to be five pirate theme levels.

375
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:40,324
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to have four new audio tracks in there, new backgrounds, and that kind of stuff.

376
00:32:41,245 --> 00:32:45,428
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just can't wait to play it.

377
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:46,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, this week is going to be awesome.

378
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,672
[SPEAKER_13]: To kind of go with that, real quick,

379
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,126
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit LittleBigPlanet related, but not.

380
00:32:55,727 --> 00:33:00,690
[SPEAKER_13]: There was an advertisement for LittleBigPlanet accessories for the PSP.

381
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:03,252
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is straight from Sony.

382
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:10,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Funny thing about that is that advertisement lists the PSP 4000 on top of the PSP Go.

383
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:12,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh.

384
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:21,686
[SPEAKER_13]: So perhaps they're going to have another reiteration of the PSP coming out.

385
00:33:23,274 --> 00:33:24,035
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

386
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:50,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Much like other Sony rumors, I'm going to say that probably we're going to hear about the PSP-4000 within the next few months.

387
00:33:50,931 --> 00:34:00,633
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really surprising to me because I would think with the Go, as much of a hard time as we've given it on this program, you'd think that if the company really believes in it, they're going to put all their might behind it.

388
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:10,736
[SPEAKER_04]: But to kind of come out and say, oh, well, we're going to go back to the old design and the 4000, which implies by nature that it's like the 3000, but with some changes, just like all the other iterations before it.

389
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:13,418
[SPEAKER_04]: and that they're going to go away.

390
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:16,722
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, this sounds like it's going to be a UMD-enabled machine.

391
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:17,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

392
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:25,893
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't be surprised if it's just something simple like adding onboard storage, because that doesn't take up that much space.

393
00:34:26,794 --> 00:34:29,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And why they couldn't do that in the first place, you know...

394
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:41,282
[SPEAKER_13]: or someone was theorizing that they may go the route where they're going to include a camera built in to compete with the DSi so that you can use the camera support since it does support the camera.

395
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:47,286
[SPEAKER_13]: They just never have released a camera over here for the PSP even though it's built into our firmware.

396
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:50,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading some comments from the chat room.

397
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:53,247
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I want to say this about the water piece of LittleBigPlanet.

398
00:34:53,907 --> 00:34:56,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Ionotropic said, whoops, where was it?

399
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw it.

400
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something about the water.

401
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:58,551
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

402
00:34:58,611 --> 00:34:59,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Water levels always suck.

403
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:00,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not want.

404
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:02,454
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

405
00:35:02,674 --> 00:35:05,697
[SPEAKER_04]: But think about what the water's going to do in the user-created levels.

406
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:06,838
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's most exciting.

407
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:10,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because water means free movement anywhere, right?

408
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:11,401
[SPEAKER_04]: No jumping, whatever.

409
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:12,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free movement.

410
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be very interesting for some of the user-created things, I think.

411
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:17,406
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, though.

412
00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:22,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Toa Gak says in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com, 4,000?

413
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:25,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to remove features again?

414
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the 3,000 lost a feature, the infrared port.

415
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:30,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the Go lost the UMD, so what's this going to lose?

416
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:33,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the infrared port I can understand because they didn't use it for anything.

417
00:35:34,617 --> 00:35:40,461
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, other than homebrew, which enabled use of it, but it didn't really use it for anything.

418
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:43,643
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they were going to possibly use it for a keyboard or something, but never did.

419
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what the PSP 4000 will do.

420
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,535
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to finally stop piracy for good.

421
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:50,497
[SPEAKER_04]: No, for real this time, guys.

422
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:52,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't laugh, don't laugh, come on, for real.

423
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:55,661
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to stop piracy and homebrew on the PSP for good.

424
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:56,662
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the 4000 is all about.

425
00:35:56,682 --> 00:36:08,493
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome that you're going to do that, except that there's all these other versions of the PSP out there that people can still pirate on, and why would they buy a new system that's not going to be able to do what they want to do?

426
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:09,414
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like...

427
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:19,919
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd be the equivalent of them making new currency that has all these counterfeiting preventive measures built into it, but we're going to accept the old currency too.

428
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:22,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Then why would you try to counterfeit the new currency?

429
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,000
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just going to counterfeit the old one.

430
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,141
[SPEAKER_13]: It's stupid.

431
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:26,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this comment in our chatroom.

432
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:29,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Joshi16 says, when will the PSP become over 9,000?

433
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:33,503
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fair question.

434
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:34,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe another five years.

435
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:35,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fair question.

436
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:38,507
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, moving on to other Sony news.

437
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:48,150
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a report out there that apparently there's a survey from an online research company that has been sent out that apparently is looking at interest in a premium subscription to PSN.

438
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:54,293
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Sony's kind of thinking about, you know, if they ask for membership fees, they could do some extra goodies and so forth.

439
00:36:54,593 --> 00:37:03,056
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, hour-long trials for full PS3 titles, access to PS1 classics and cross-game voice chat, etc.

440
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:09,368
[SPEAKER_04]: which apparently is still not, I always thought that was kind of there in PS3 games, but apparently it is still not there.

441
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:22,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, also something called Cloud Storage, which, you know, is similar to what we have with Steam Cloud, which basically could be an online space where you can store saved data and then you can pull your saved games from this cloud.

442
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:26,456
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, this is very good for when you're going over to friends' houses and so forth.

443
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:32,279
[SPEAKER_04]: The survey also drops hints that they're thinking about things like streaming Netflix without a disc.

444
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:32,739
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

445
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:36,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Hulu support, free access to minis, premium things, and so forth.

446
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:40,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I would not read too much into these types of surveys.

447
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:41,948
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, surveys are surveys.

448
00:37:42,288 --> 00:37:47,353
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gauging interest, and they're going to throw all sorts of possibilities out there that might not have been thought up by Sony.

449
00:37:47,493 --> 00:37:49,375
[SPEAKER_04]: They might have been thought up by the marketing company.

450
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:55,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's that old corporate mentality of, let's throw things against the wall and see what sticks.

451
00:37:56,181 --> 00:38:00,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it's not to say that nothing here is ever going to come true.

452
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:06,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone with power is thinking about it, but I don't think there's need to flail and panic just yet.

453
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:09,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, DarkSakura, what do you think?

454
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:10,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Agree?

455
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:10,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Disagree?

456
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:15,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of it will probably come true because all the Sony rumors seem to come true sooner or later.

457
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:17,299
[SPEAKER_10]: They have laser getting leaked.

458
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:18,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

459
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:18,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

460
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:44,740
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

461
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:11,594
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess then at the same time, you can play games for free on Sony's network, and you can't do that on Xbox.

462
00:39:11,614 --> 00:39:14,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So what might be considered a core feature one system might not be for another.

463
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:15,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

464
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:24,141
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think a lot of the problems with the Sony system is that they don't have their own network.

465
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:28,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, they have their own network, but they don't have their dedicated servers, basically.

466
00:39:28,103 --> 00:39:36,328
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just all... Each company has their own servers for PlayStation games, since everything on Xbox Live is basically on the Microsoft servers.

467
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:44,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Cross chat, cross servers is going to be tough because, you know, it's all these different servers you have to go through.

468
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,501
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't know.

469
00:39:46,521 --> 00:39:48,662
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess they could do it if they really wanted to.

470
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:52,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the chat room for some other comments on this story.

471
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:58,469
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru in our chat room says, Doesn't Sony realize that their free service is the only advantage PSN has over Xbox Live?

472
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:01,830
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Tyrant says, I really enjoy Core, to be honest.

473
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I heart Veronica Belmont.

474
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,331
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of Core fans out there.

475
00:40:05,551 --> 00:40:09,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I personally don't subscribe, but I don't think it's a...

476
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:10,412
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

477
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, we have some news regarding SingStar.

478
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:41,008
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite.

479
00:40:42,248 --> 00:40:43,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, of course, I gave you ABBA.

480
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,713
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a SingStar viewer application to be released.

481
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:56,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it doesn't have a date yet, but to be coming out for PS3 that has a different social networking.

482
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:58,880
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do...

483
00:41:00,846 --> 00:41:02,548
[SPEAKER_10]: and different things with the players.

484
00:41:02,648 --> 00:41:06,991
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually called SingStar Viewer, like I said, which would be in your games folder.

485
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,354
[SPEAKER_10]: You can browse and purchase songs from the SingStore.

486
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:15,958
[SPEAKER_10]: You can vote on videos and photos and rate stuff and it's supposed to be free.

487
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:21,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And you also should be able to use it even when you do not have the SingStar disc in the system.

488
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:28,468
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, not a date yet on it, but it says that it should be in the coming weeks.

489
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:31,045
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

490
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,048
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

491
00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:27,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess, you know, and it's also kind of one of those things where I think that's where it ultimately might help drive sales is that people download this and go, oh, this is really funny, but I can do better.

492
00:42:28,018 --> 00:42:35,507
[SPEAKER_04]: My nephew can sing better than this kid, or I got an outfit that outdoes this one, so they're going to go buy the game so they can get on the SingStar channel.

493
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,308
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

494
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:37,009
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

495
00:42:38,163 --> 00:42:44,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly a selling point of the game that Lips doesn't have, or Karaoke Revolution doesn't have, or hell, even Rock Band doesn't have this.

496
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:47,185
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't save your performances from Rock Band.

497
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:51,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you imagine... Oh god, maybe this is something they're going to cook up for Rock Band 3.

498
00:42:52,746 --> 00:42:54,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow, I think I might be onto something.

499
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:57,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially in this whole thing that we're getting into.

500
00:42:57,647 --> 00:43:00,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine if Rock Band 3 had this type of...

501
00:43:02,055 --> 00:43:02,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that might be it.

502
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:04,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet that's where they're going to go with this.

503
00:43:04,698 --> 00:43:08,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Some type of share your performance on the internet type thing.

504
00:43:09,062 --> 00:43:09,783
[SPEAKER_10]: SingStar Idol?

505
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:11,765
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing it the other way right now, aren't they?

506
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:16,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Where if you're a band, put your song in Rock Band for the masses to consume.

507
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, I bet that's what's coming in Rock Band 3.

508
00:43:20,313 --> 00:43:21,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Share your performance with the internet.

509
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:22,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch!

510
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:23,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch!

511
00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:33,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, SingStar's got the leg up on it, but I wonder, if this thing is successful, only a matter of time before the other music games notice.

512
00:43:36,296 --> 00:43:41,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, if there was a Rock Band 3 with internet connectivity, would you consider uploading some of your epic performances to it?

513
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:43,762
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really played it that much, sadly.

514
00:43:43,782 --> 00:43:44,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

515
00:43:44,683 --> 00:43:44,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

516
00:43:45,243 --> 00:43:45,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

517
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:47,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to see you doing the Timmy song.

518
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:50,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Lords of the Underworld.

519
00:43:51,147 --> 00:43:51,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

520
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:54,610
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

521
00:43:56,168 --> 00:44:04,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, another thing that you can kind of share in would be the new Sodium-1, which is kind of an MMO, I guess, on home.

522
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:05,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

523
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:08,537
[SPEAKER_13]: I apparently ignored the whole MMO part of it because...

524
00:44:09,158 --> 00:44:10,458
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually checked it out a little bit.

525
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:16,219
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a self-contained social MMO, they're calling it, within PlayStation Home.

526
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,620
[SPEAKER_13]: And you kind of go through this teleporter that's in the Central Plaza.

527
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:25,561
[SPEAKER_13]: And you go in there and talk to this AI chick called Vicky.

528
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:29,302
[SPEAKER_13]: And she gives you different mini-games and whatnot that you can play.

529
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:33,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Including some different objective-based meta-games.

530
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:38,804
[SPEAKER_13]: And they also have a full arcade-style game to play as well called the Assault Shooter.

531
00:44:39,844 --> 00:45:09,316
[SPEAKER_04]: which I thought was kind of fun but I think as you were saying it's a little bit like Battlezone I think the old Atari game I feel like I've played a game like it on the PC back when I had a 386 and I don't remember what the game was but it was one of those things that you would call up on the modem and play like oh man I distinctly remember a game it was very popular too it was the wire graphics like Battlezone but it was this whole type of thing where you were out in a field and you would shoot tanks you know like I want to say I've played this game before you know

532
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:35,591
[SPEAKER_13]: um and then of course you get different unlocks for you know leveling up in the game apparently the uh salt shooter game that's in there only five levels are available in the game for free and you have to buy more um uh or i guess uh yeah more levels and items are unlockable through micro transactions yeah i think i would have played it up to about level five i played it only through level three before i got you know tired of doing it because i was working on some other stuff um

533
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:38,210
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

534
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:04,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the drink-making game, that was kind of multiplayer.

535
00:46:04,904 --> 00:46:07,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you play as the bartender, someone else is calling the drinks.

536
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're ordering the drinks, someone else has to play the bartender.

537
00:46:10,408 --> 00:46:12,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, there's, I guess, that.

538
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,170
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a bit of a stretch.

539
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'd call it an MMO.

540
00:46:15,011 --> 00:46:19,714
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I thought was interesting about this is the way it kind of fit into the context of home.

541
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:26,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and it kind of showed off these features of home that I didn't realize were there, such as the ability to interact with what's on the web.

542
00:46:27,158 --> 00:46:29,800
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to the website, SodiumOne.com, I think it is,

543
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,724
[SPEAKER_04]: and you actually put in your PlayStation ID and all this stuff, it tracks your mini achievements.

544
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're not actual trophies, but they're like achievements within Sodium.

545
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:39,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It tracks them on the website.

546
00:46:39,669 --> 00:46:40,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It tracks your high scores.

547
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,152
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Facebook app that you can use.

548
00:46:43,192 --> 00:46:52,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, it's just going to... I enabled it, but I didn't enable it to publish it on my wall because I knew every time I did something in the game, all my friends would have to see it and I didn't want to burden people with that.

549
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:54,944
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does have that connectivity.

550
00:46:55,444 --> 00:46:56,165
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

551
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:27,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I also thought it was interesting that you could, you know, the points that you earn in the game could go towards unlocking stuff in the home that you could put, like, if you go to the OLR Clubhouse now, there's a new table, there's some new seats, and a new little statue.

552
00:47:27,393 --> 00:47:29,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I got all that in the Sodium One thing.

553
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:30,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and...

554
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:31,514
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

555
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,763
[SPEAKER_04]: This really feels like what Home was advertised as a year and a half ago.

556
00:47:58,464 --> 00:48:02,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Games and social interaction working seamlessly together.

557
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:11,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a bummer that I feel like the game I'm playing here I played back in 1996 on a modem on my PC, but okay, it's a step forward.

558
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:13,994
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

559
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:15,895
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a neat game, but it's just like...

560
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:18,364
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

561
00:48:35,805 --> 00:48:39,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we still don't have our trophy room with our trophies in it.

562
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:41,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So what else do we have to look forward to at home?

563
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:46,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the game integration and the way that it's going to integrate with the rest of the PlayStation brand.

564
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:49,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see this as a step forward.

565
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:52,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big step forward, but it was neat.

566
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:53,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I was entertained for an hour.

567
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:54,957
[SPEAKER_04]: For free.

568
00:48:55,277 --> 00:49:01,141
[SPEAKER_13]: I did get the water still as my creepy Santa Claus, which this time of year is very relevant.

569
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:01,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

570
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:08,840
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the dollies just passed out from excitement apparently over the snooze.

571
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:09,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.

572
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:12,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't have a very stable place to put her.

573
00:49:12,643 --> 00:49:12,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

574
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:17,535
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, I don't know.

575
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see where this leads in 2010.

576
00:49:19,316 --> 00:49:20,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

577
00:49:21,296 --> 00:49:23,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks in chat are asking about the OLR Clubhouse.

578
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:25,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, on Sony Home we have an OLR Clubhouse.

579
00:49:25,818 --> 00:49:26,938
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be full.

580
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:28,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have 25 members in it now.

581
00:49:28,659 --> 00:49:30,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't even joined yet and it's full already.

582
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:30,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

583
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

584
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to send a request to...

585
00:49:34,986 --> 00:49:35,807
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

586
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:53,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Outro Music

587
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:22,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathwishing is saying requests.

588
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:28,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I approved all the pending requests, so I will go in tonight and make sure it's all approved.

589
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:30,952
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's full, I don't know what to tell you.

590
00:50:30,992 --> 00:50:31,613
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be screwed.

591
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

592
00:50:33,014 --> 00:50:34,775
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least you'll have this to look forward to.

593
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Something on PBS.

594
00:50:37,096 --> 00:50:39,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, PBS, the public broadcast system.

595
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:42,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Most popularly known maybe for the Lawrence Welk show.

596
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

597
00:50:43,701 --> 00:50:44,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Reading Rainbow, Rob.

598
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:46,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Sesame Street.

599
00:50:46,242 --> 00:50:46,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Doctor Who.

600
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:47,583
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

601
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:48,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Early Doctor Who.

602
00:50:48,624 --> 00:50:50,025
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of great British imports.

603
00:50:50,045 --> 00:50:51,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Dwarf.

604
00:50:51,366 --> 00:50:52,948
[SPEAKER_04]: The public broadcasting system.

605
00:50:53,448 --> 00:50:55,850
[SPEAKER_04]: All kidding aside, you know the types of stuff they show on here.

606
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:56,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Masterpiece Theater.

607
00:50:57,011 --> 00:51:03,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times, a lot of orchestral concerts and a lot of things you would see at an opera house and so forth.

608
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:10,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might surprise you to know that PBS is planning to record and air video games live in 2010.

609
00:51:10,962 --> 00:51:12,163
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

610
00:51:12,263 --> 00:51:15,246
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing that was kind of meant to bridge that gap...

611
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:16,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

612
00:51:29,793 --> 00:51:31,394
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

613
00:51:50,609 --> 00:52:15,483
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently also a DVD and Blu-ray because PBS puts out a lot of their programming on DVD Blu-ray to kind of raise money for the stations because you know they're all publicly funded and so forth so you know sales from those will go to help fund PBS so that's kind of cool for those that were looking to you know especially if you live in a place that doesn't get video games live coming there although they've gone to a lot of places you'll have an opportunity to see the show so that's pretty cool

614
00:52:16,997 --> 00:52:19,358
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to dress, though, dress to impress because you might be on TV.

615
00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:20,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something to think about.

616
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, TigerClaw on chat says, that would be cool.

617
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:24,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I get PBS and HD.

618
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,663
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, you know, considering we're talking Blu-ray and PBS.

619
00:52:28,204 --> 00:52:31,425
[SPEAKER_04]: PBS was like the first channel I remember seeing going HD.

620
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:35,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I think PBS was in HD long before NBC and the other folks got on board.

621
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:37,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to look good.

622
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:38,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to look good.

623
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:41,771
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get to see all of Tommy's outfit changes in high definition.

624
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:42,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be quite impressive.

625
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:45,475
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

626
00:53:10,735 --> 00:53:11,576
[SPEAKER_10]: It is for adults.

627
00:53:11,636 --> 00:53:12,778
[SPEAKER_10]: It is bloody and frightening.

628
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:13,959
[SPEAKER_10]: That was our intent.

629
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:26,834
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically they're saying that they're going to leave it to the reasonable expectations of adults to, you know, whether or not they want to get the game or not.

630
00:53:27,222 --> 00:53:42,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to remember talking about this in a previous episode and the fact that the bankers behind that game are very cold and unwilling to budge on this is that we made this game and we are not changing it and if you are not a responsible enough adult to play it, then don't play it.

631
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:44,816
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not changing it because you can't handle it.

632
00:53:46,277 --> 00:53:47,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admire it.

633
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:52,682
[SPEAKER_04]: They might go down in flames, but I have to admire them not wanting to budge.

634
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:54,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Stick to them guns and make them some integrity.

635
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:56,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold star for all of you kids.

636
00:53:56,264 --> 00:53:56,985
[SPEAKER_10]: No selling out.

637
00:53:58,553 --> 00:54:00,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think other places have sold out, Rob?

638
00:54:02,017 --> 00:54:04,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Like other game companies?

639
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:11,488
[SPEAKER_04]: One could claim that Valve and so forth sold out when they made those changes to get the game released in Australia and so forth.

640
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:14,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, let me say this and then I'll go on the tangent.

641
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:23,331
[SPEAKER_04]: is that, you know, but I don't know if that was so much selling out as it was, you know, they did what they had to do to release the game.

642
00:54:23,771 --> 00:54:26,353
[SPEAKER_04]: People in movies do this all the time.

643
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:33,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you think these guys are bad in the other countries, look at what they do right here in America with the Motion Picture Association.

644
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:43,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Heaven forbid you show a vagina or a penis in your movie or you're going to get smacked with an NC-17 rating and no theater house in America is going to show your movie.

645
00:54:43,307 --> 00:54:44,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Life of Brian does not have an NC-17 rating.

646
00:54:45,822 --> 00:54:46,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's got full frontal.

647
00:54:46,903 --> 00:54:51,445
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also a lot older, I think, when movies were fitting into the X category.

648
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:58,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it might have still been R. I don't think that it... It was R. For some reason in the 70s, like Porky's and a lot of these movies somehow got under the radar.

649
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:00,770
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, in this day and age, let's face it.

650
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:04,291
[SPEAKER_04]: A movie like Showgirls got a rating like NC-17.

651
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:07,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Not because it was bad, but because it had a lot of tits and ass.

652
00:55:08,193 --> 00:55:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: But heaven forbid...

653
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:11,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the same thing.

654
00:55:28,418 --> 00:55:37,525
[SPEAKER_04]: and directors and so forth change their movies all the time to get down to the R rating because they know if they release it with an NC-17 rating, they're screwed.

655
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:39,026
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll never make the money back on the movie.

656
00:55:39,066 --> 00:55:40,688
[SPEAKER_04]: The studios force them to do it.

657
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:43,270
[SPEAKER_04]: They are contractually obliged to deliver a certain rating.

658
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:51,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while you get those indie studios that are like, if you were releasing our unrated movie, once in a while you see those slip through the cracks, but unfortunately they don't make money.

659
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:55,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you get the unrated version for a home release.

660
00:55:55,419 --> 00:55:55,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

661
00:55:58,084 --> 00:56:24,762
[SPEAKER_04]: and some folks in chat are saying X movie has full frontal and Y movie has full frontal okay yeah okay fine you know you can show a little peen and a little vag and get away with it but you know usually you have to appeal it to get the rating and let's face it you and I you the listener and I the host can agree that the standards between violence and nudity are way different come on you can't show you can't show penetration in a movie but you can show a bullet going through someone's brain

662
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:26,684
[SPEAKER_04]: You can show that penetration.

663
00:56:29,046 --> 00:56:29,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

664
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:36,813
[SPEAKER_13]: What if you fired a penis instead of a bullet and it penetrated instead of their head or vagina?

665
00:56:37,033 --> 00:56:38,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that still count if it's fired from a gun?

666
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:39,756
[SPEAKER_04]: NC-17.

667
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:41,337
[SPEAKER_04]: A cum shot is always going to get you NC-17.

668
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:41,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.

669
00:56:43,996 --> 00:56:44,977
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

670
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:02,742
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

671
00:57:28,573 --> 00:57:38,595
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have to say he made a pretty damn good movie I wouldn't say you should see it if you're under 17 but if you are of age I really liked that movie I thought it was a great movie too

672
00:57:40,144 --> 00:57:43,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that the lady in it was in Hedwig.

673
00:57:44,607 --> 00:57:46,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Poppin' Chat brings up a good point.

674
00:57:46,788 --> 00:57:49,230
[SPEAKER_04]: They did that in Scary Movie 2, Dick in the Head.

675
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:50,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that.

676
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:51,751
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true.

677
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:53,172
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't see balls, though.

678
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:56,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's not penis people have a problem with, it's balls.

679
00:57:57,275 --> 00:57:58,095
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like breasts.

680
00:57:58,515 --> 00:58:01,217
[SPEAKER_13]: The breast is okay, but the nipple, oh my god, no.

681
00:58:03,004 --> 00:58:03,224
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

682
00:58:03,765 --> 00:58:06,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move around the country and cover some release dates.

683
00:58:07,147 --> 00:58:08,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Things that are okay.

684
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:09,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

685
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:10,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot a tangent.

686
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:15,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of our folks that works for Orange Lingerie would want me to say something about this on air.

687
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:18,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Deekman, because he posted this to the Twitter earlier this week.

688
00:58:18,757 --> 00:58:24,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear about the Australian censorship and the fact that they are looking at – and I don't know if this is somebody running with us.

689
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:31,808
[SPEAKER_04]: They are looking at installing basically China-like restrictions on their internet and filtering out objectionable sites, quote.

690
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:36,126
[SPEAKER_13]: This is really going to hurt your tough man edge, Australia.

691
00:58:36,186 --> 00:58:41,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, seriously, it was all about, you know, crocodile hunters and beer drinking and kangaroos over there.

692
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:43,430
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not an internet.

693
00:58:43,891 --> 00:58:45,632
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't forget the transvestites.

694
00:58:46,832 --> 00:58:50,975
[SPEAKER_13]: But now it's just like, you know, censored internet.

695
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:54,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that just got misconstrued.

696
00:58:54,637 --> 00:58:55,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope.

697
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And Deekman posted it to our Twitter.

698
00:58:58,199 --> 00:58:59,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little disheartening.

699
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:09,018
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that any type of censorship is... The only people who I think should be allowed to censor are parents and people censoring themselves.

700
00:59:09,653 --> 00:59:15,637
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I'm not mistaking, Australia has a parliament-style government, which means they do have elected officials.

701
00:59:15,997 --> 00:59:22,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So Australians, if you're listening and you disagree with this, vote your politicians the fuck out of office immediately.

702
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless, of course, they were the politicians that were against this.

703
00:59:25,323 --> 00:59:32,328
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe in your country, you do vote, and you vote these people the fuck out that are trying to do this.

704
00:59:33,976 --> 00:59:36,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to happier topics.

705
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:38,217
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of angst tonight.

706
00:59:38,577 --> 00:59:41,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear I'm actually in a really good mood, all things considered.

707
00:59:42,739 --> 00:59:44,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is pretty good right now.

708
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't complain, so I don't know why we're having such an angsty show tonight.

709
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,841
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR, quit trying to bring me down.

710
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:55,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, not much coming out this week in the U.S., mainly three games.

711
00:59:56,193 --> 01:00:01,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

712
01:00:01,595 --> 01:00:07,118
[SPEAKER_13]: That is, of course, if you didn't get it free with Guitar Hero 5 during the month of September.

713
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:27,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Twin Sector being released on PC and finally on the Wii we have Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bears coming out on the Wii the first real good Wii Final Fantasy game That's the one that they've been advertising ever since the damn thing launched, right?

714
01:00:28,108 --> 01:00:29,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, that would be the one

715
01:00:31,536 --> 01:00:32,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not one of them.

716
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:50,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So now things are dying down a little bit there, but that's not to say there's nothing coming out.

717
01:00:50,278 --> 01:00:59,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360 is getting a price reduction this week in Japan, as well as Infernal Hell's Vengeance is a new game coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.

718
01:01:00,382 --> 01:01:05,545
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 3, it sounds like a new Hori arcade stick is coming out, but that is really it.

719
01:01:05,565 --> 01:01:11,948
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no new releases on the particular system, which, considering the games usually come out Friday over there, and Friday is Christmas Eve...

720
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:14,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to really see a whole lot, probably.

721
01:01:15,469 --> 01:01:17,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Wii, same story.

722
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Going over to the PlayStation 2.

723
01:01:20,231 --> 01:01:24,472
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a Neo Geo Online Collection Complete Box Volumes 1 and 2.

724
01:01:24,872 --> 01:01:26,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That is something new coming out over there.

725
01:01:26,973 --> 01:01:28,974
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, that's just rehashed old stuff.

726
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:35,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the Nintendo DS, Zelda no Densetsu Taiyou no Kiteki.

727
01:01:35,636 --> 01:01:37,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to guess what that is on the Nintendo DS?

728
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:38,757
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say the train game.

729
01:01:38,857 --> 01:01:39,337
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

730
01:01:39,357 --> 01:01:40,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid candle won't light.

731
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, and I got my days mixed up.

732
01:02:05,106 --> 01:02:06,667
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says Thursday is Christmas Eve.

733
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:07,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Friday is Christmas Day.

734
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:09,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry.

735
01:02:09,988 --> 01:02:11,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, who keeps up with Christmas anymore?

736
01:02:11,868 --> 01:02:15,810
[SPEAKER_04]: The releases are getting all messed up because of the holidays anyway.

737
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:21,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's pretty much dry in the UK.

738
01:02:21,831 --> 01:02:23,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Just one game on the 22nd.

739
01:02:23,992 --> 01:02:26,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, one game came out today, Nicky Rock'n'Ball.

740
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:30,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I should say yesterday now for them because it's the 20th already.

741
01:02:31,724 --> 01:02:34,928
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 22nd is Savage Moon, the Hera campaign on PSP.

742
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,751
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about it.

743
01:02:52,562 --> 01:03:04,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking about Final Fantasy XIII, it did pretty well this week, including 1 million copies sold within, I believe, the first 24 hours.

744
01:03:04,511 --> 01:03:04,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

745
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:05,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

746
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:06,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Over 2 million copies sold.

747
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:10,776
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they shipped 2 million, so probably between 1 and 2 million copies sold.

748
01:03:12,257 --> 01:03:19,482
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, that includes the Lightning Edition PS3 with the silkscreen pink...

749
01:03:21,803 --> 01:03:22,545
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

750
01:03:28,433 --> 01:03:33,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically the equivalent of a Modern Warfare 2 here, which sold what?

751
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:37,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they say it sold like 7 million in the first week or some huge amount?

752
01:03:37,919 --> 01:03:40,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 sold millions.

753
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:45,644
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of the equivalent over there, which surprises probably no one.

754
01:03:47,005 --> 01:03:51,928
[SPEAKER_04]: But the real question is, what will happen when the game comes out here?

755
01:03:52,068 --> 01:03:53,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it move a million in one night here?

756
01:03:53,969 --> 01:03:54,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it will.

757
01:03:55,772 --> 01:03:56,673
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

758
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:16,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Squeenix is now accepting beta applications for Final Fantasy XIV.

759
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:21,058
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're skipping Final Fantasy XIII, maybe you are looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.

760
01:04:21,378 --> 01:04:24,701
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, the applications are now open for the Final Fantasy XIV beta.

761
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:26,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Please note, this is only the Windows edition.

762
01:04:26,983 --> 01:04:35,369
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not doing, it looks like, what they did on the PlayStation 2 for Final Fantasy XI, where they actually were shipping hard drives to people to beta test that, and they could keep them as a thank you gift.

763
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:36,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-uh, not the case here.

764
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:40,253
[SPEAKER_04]: You will have to sign up for only the Windows version, at least for right now.

765
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:45,117
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't know if I'm honestly, I hardly have time to play World of Warcraft and Star Trek Online's coming out

766
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:11,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm in the same boat.

767
01:05:11,218 --> 01:05:16,544
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, I will push World of Warcraft to the side for a little while to focus on this if it's good.

768
01:05:16,924 --> 01:05:23,151
[SPEAKER_04]: If they've learned from their mistakes from XI, which I still think XI was a solid game for its time, it just didn't age well.

769
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:30,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if they really have combined the best parts of that with the best parts of World of Warcraft, this game could be pretty awesome.

770
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:32,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to check it out.

771
01:05:33,877 --> 01:05:38,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow though, just so you know, you need to be 18 years old in order to apply.

772
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:48,110
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be fluent in English, which if you're listening to this show, I'm assuming you are, or you could be fluent in Japanese, French, or German, because I know we do have some listeners in Japan and even some of those other countries there.

773
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:54,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently though, a PS3 one will come out later, it's just that right now you can only sign up for the PC version.

774
01:05:55,336 --> 01:06:19,015
[SPEAKER_04]: also no MMORPG experience required but I will tell you since I did sign up be prepared to fill out a little bit of a questionnaire about your gaming experience which is translated from a Japanese version you can kind of tell but yeah let us know if any of you OLR people get in let me know so I can be jealous especially if I don't get in this would use my play online ID right?

775
01:06:19,095 --> 01:06:21,898
[SPEAKER_04]: no it doesn't I think they're going away from play online

776
01:06:22,642 --> 01:06:23,202
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

777
01:06:50,421 --> 01:06:51,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Great pick.

778
01:06:51,061 --> 01:06:52,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have the music here shortly.

779
01:06:52,462 --> 01:06:54,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Firefox had to reboot, so I'll get the music here in a moment.

780
01:06:55,482 --> 01:07:06,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the game originally came out in Japan in 1987 for the Famicom Disk System, as did the third one, too.

781
01:07:08,486 --> 01:07:09,706
[SPEAKER_10]: It came out in the U.S.

782
01:07:10,366 --> 01:07:11,847
[SPEAKER_10]: in cartridge form in 1988.

783
01:07:12,347 --> 01:07:16,528
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit of a different...

784
01:07:18,018 --> 01:07:18,418
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

785
01:07:40,405 --> 01:07:46,891
[SPEAKER_10]: You do have to buy items, which you'll need to get to different areas.

786
01:07:46,931 --> 01:07:47,792
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to get hearts.

787
01:07:49,694 --> 01:07:51,635
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can also buy new whips as you keep going on.

788
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:55,078
[SPEAKER_10]: You have an experience rating system.

789
01:07:56,019 --> 01:07:59,883
[SPEAKER_10]: So your experience rating increases, of course, as you collect hearts.

790
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:06,649
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's actually something that made it into Dracula X. Not Dracula X, but Symphony of the Night, if you'll remember.

791
01:08:07,185 --> 01:08:35,695
[SPEAKER_04]: and as you can probably hear there a little bit of I did get the music to come up so of course Castlevania 2 who did not love the music in this game now we have some of the music playing in the background that's right but anyway I'll listen to it for a little bit easily one of the 10 best songs ever in a video game easily yeah

792
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:46,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... Anyway, the whole point of the game is that you have to go to different mansions to find different parts of Dracula's corpse and then the magic cross.

793
01:08:46,929 --> 01:08:55,352
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um... You can actually use the different body parts as power-ups, kind of, like the rib bone is a shield.

794
01:08:56,073 --> 01:08:56,913
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, um...

795
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:02,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you get everything, you can clear the blockade to Dracula's Castle and fight!

796
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:11,961
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it was directed by Akamatsu, who also did Castlevania III, and...

797
01:09:14,716 --> 01:09:21,138
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a password system for the US version as opposed to the save system that Famicom Disk System had.

798
01:09:21,178 --> 01:09:22,158
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like, side bike?

799
01:09:22,718 --> 01:09:24,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

800
01:09:25,059 --> 01:09:27,699
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also some pretty crazy English in the game.

801
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, uh, naming Simon Simmon.

802
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:32,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Like with two M's.

803
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:33,861
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um...

804
01:09:37,856 --> 01:09:48,001
[SPEAKER_10]: There's, you know, of course, the music in it was done by Matsubara Kenichi, who did the Castlevania Arcade, the Haunted Castle.

805
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:52,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And they also used some of that for Simon's Quest.

806
01:09:56,045 --> 01:09:57,226
[SPEAKER_10]: It also has...

807
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:05,132
[SPEAKER_10]: The different parts of the game, you know, the statues and things, crying blood.

808
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:08,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So, lots of cool stuff going on.

809
01:10:10,655 --> 01:10:14,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, it actually, the game caused some controversy in the U.S.

810
01:10:14,196 --> 01:10:14,996
[SPEAKER_10]: with Nintendo Power.

811
01:10:16,477 --> 01:10:25,181
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the second issue of Nintendo Power that had the Simon's Quest cover, and it was also with Howard and Nestor, if you remember Howard and Nestor.

812
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:27,302
[SPEAKER_10]: But the...

813
01:10:29,406 --> 01:10:30,967
[SPEAKER_10]: The cover apparently scared children.

814
01:10:32,848 --> 01:10:34,169
[SPEAKER_10]: So, caused a little problem.

815
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:36,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I got in trouble in grade school over this magazine.

816
01:10:37,071 --> 01:10:39,012
[SPEAKER_04]: It had nothing to do with the cover, actually.

817
01:10:39,052 --> 01:10:42,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that I brought it to school one day, and I was trying to show a friend of mine during class.

818
01:10:42,575 --> 01:10:43,696
[SPEAKER_04]: The teacher was pissed at me.

819
01:10:44,396 --> 01:10:47,358
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was so excited, because it was Castlevania II, and it was awesome.

820
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:48,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

821
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, also, uh, with this...

822
01:10:53,868 --> 01:10:54,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

823
01:11:11,408 --> 01:11:18,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly this game was so different from the first Castlevania that you already kind of started splitting up the series in a way at this point.

824
01:11:18,614 --> 01:11:28,282
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just have to say real quick, it was very interesting in the 8-bit era how deviant sequels were of the original.

825
01:11:28,843 --> 01:11:30,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you think about Super Mario Bros.

826
01:11:31,004 --> 01:11:32,446
[SPEAKER_04]: 2, way different than the first one.

827
01:11:32,466 --> 01:11:33,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Bros.

828
01:11:33,026 --> 01:11:34,027
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 was a different game.

829
01:11:34,187 --> 01:11:40,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know, but still, our perception of it as kids, you know, not knowing this whole Japanese stuff, was way different here.

830
01:11:40,749 --> 01:11:42,689
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Castlevania 2 was really different.

831
01:11:43,009 --> 01:11:44,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man 2 was kind of different.

832
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:48,771
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of sequels in the 8-bit era were really different than the original game.

833
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:50,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say that Mega Man 2 was at all different.

834
01:11:51,632 --> 01:12:00,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Each of the Mega Man games on the NES just kept adding different things and changing different, but they all pretty much kept the same formula.

835
01:12:00,154 --> 01:12:02,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Even the X series kept the same formula.

836
01:12:03,996 --> 01:12:13,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't really say that those weren't too different, but in this case, this one is a fairly big departure from how the first one went.

837
01:12:14,241 --> 01:12:21,785
[SPEAKER_04]: But then what was also particularly weird about this and Super Mario Bros., I guess you could say, is that they both went kind of back to the formula of the original in the third game.

838
01:12:22,485 --> 01:12:26,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Super Mario, debatable, but Castlevania definitely went back to kind of the formula of the first game.

839
01:12:26,947 --> 01:12:31,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, Super Mario 2 in Japan was what we got as the lost levels.

840
01:12:31,589 --> 01:12:32,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, sure.

841
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:32,730
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was...

842
01:12:33,214 --> 01:12:35,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like the first one, only harder.

843
01:12:35,576 --> 01:12:37,758
[SPEAKER_10]: And he had the poison mushrooms and stuff.

844
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:38,879
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

845
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:47,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Mario, actually, if you look at it with the actual successors to the original, that one kept the same formula, too.

846
01:12:49,808 --> 01:12:51,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say real quick from chat, because this is a really good point.

847
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:57,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, says, The platformer in Retro Game Challenge was different in all three versions.

848
01:12:58,255 --> 01:13:00,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in that game, they made the sequel so different.

849
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:01,518
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of like an inside joke.

850
01:13:03,516 --> 01:13:27,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at any rate, something that might be interesting to other people, this is from an interview in 2002, is Igarashi Koji, who is like one of my video game heroes and who I got a hug from, I'm so happy, actually was talking about considering a compilation of the NES titles for, I suppose, either Game Boy or PC, so...

851
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:28,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this music right here.

852
01:13:29,002 --> 01:13:31,963
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the very first song you hear when you press start.

853
01:13:55,061 --> 01:14:00,426
[SPEAKER_04]: If nothing else, just like one of the best music game soundtracks you will ever hear.

854
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:03,950
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I do have to say there is a Castlevania game that has a better soundtrack.

855
01:14:05,251 --> 01:14:14,159
[SPEAKER_10]: But in my opinion, it's Dracula X. Not just because it was Red Book Audio, because I actually like the process, the music on the SNES version better in some cases.

856
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,843
[SPEAKER_10]: But it did have some fantastic mixes of the songs.

857
01:14:18,928 --> 01:14:23,810
[SPEAKER_10]: So, but I'd have to put this up there, at least as far as the NES titles go.

858
01:14:24,531 --> 01:14:25,951
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's probably got my favorite music in it.

859
01:14:26,792 --> 01:14:27,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

860
01:14:27,232 --> 01:14:33,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Our other pal, Bress Lowell, in chat, who, of course, is a co-host on Understation Live, says, Simon's Quest is actually my least favorite Castlevania game.

861
01:14:34,115 --> 01:14:38,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if you want to see something really funny about Simon's Quest, just look for the Angry Nintendo Nerd.

862
01:14:39,137 --> 01:14:39,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

863
01:14:40,037 --> 01:14:43,199
[SPEAKER_10]: His version, his description of it was fantastic.

864
01:14:44,482 --> 01:14:51,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say my least favorite Castlevania game, and I know this is one of your favorites, Jamie, but Castlevania V on the SNES was ruined for me.

865
01:14:52,147 --> 01:14:52,227
[SPEAKER_04]: V?

866
01:14:52,427 --> 01:14:53,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, right?

867
01:14:53,588 --> 01:14:59,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was supposed to be the port of Dracula... It came out as Dracula X. Didn't they call it Dracula V?

868
01:14:59,812 --> 01:15:07,977
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they called it Dracula X. I thought in a magazine it was like Castlevania V. I've got the box, it says Dracula X. But I just thought at some point, I remember referring to it as Castlevania V, but...

869
01:15:08,932 --> 01:15:11,673
[SPEAKER_10]: It did come out after Super Castlevania 4.

870
01:15:11,853 --> 01:15:12,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

871
01:15:12,533 --> 01:15:19,936
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was so... Yeah, no, it was really... I would have to say neutered.

872
01:15:20,536 --> 01:15:26,518
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a castrated version of Dracula X. Rob, you're going to have to come over some night and just play through Dracula X with me.

873
01:15:26,858 --> 01:15:27,718
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun.

874
01:15:27,858 --> 01:15:29,018
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Neo Geo.

875
01:15:29,038 --> 01:15:29,899
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to put a feed up.

876
01:15:32,233 --> 01:15:33,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob playing as Maria.

877
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:36,016
[SPEAKER_10]: La la la, la la la la.

878
01:15:36,076 --> 01:15:37,116
[SPEAKER_10]: One of her attacks is singing.

879
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:37,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

880
01:15:38,057 --> 01:15:40,418
[SPEAKER_10]: And she sings badly that it kills like everything around her.

881
01:15:40,558 --> 01:15:42,179
[SPEAKER_10]: And her little thing is la la la, la la la.

882
01:15:44,721 --> 01:15:48,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you're forgetting, I think Breslau might be neglecting a Castlevania Judgment.

883
01:15:49,564 --> 01:15:49,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh, what?

884
01:15:50,424 --> 01:15:51,485
[SPEAKER_04]: The fighting game on Wii.

885
01:15:51,605 --> 01:15:51,825
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

886
01:15:52,265 --> 01:15:52,946
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't, what?

887
01:15:53,146 --> 01:15:53,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

888
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:54,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't exist in your universe.

889
01:15:54,927 --> 01:15:55,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

890
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:58,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe Castlevania 64?

891
01:15:58,967 --> 01:15:59,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap!

892
01:15:59,808 --> 01:16:02,089
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, Breslul, Castlevania 64.

893
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:02,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Loki wins.

894
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:04,571
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty bad.

895
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,633
[SPEAKER_04]: That was definitely a low point in the Castlevania series.

896
01:16:08,093 --> 01:16:11,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.

897
01:16:11,055 --> 01:16:12,096
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break, though.

898
01:16:12,136 --> 01:16:15,678
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so please stay tuned.

899
01:16:15,718 --> 01:16:16,759
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be right back.

900
01:16:22,915 --> 01:16:23,636
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

901
01:16:44,534 --> 01:16:49,916
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had some rants and stuff, and I got angry earlier in the show, but obviously I saved this for later in the show.

902
01:16:50,016 --> 01:16:51,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out I might be wrong.

903
01:16:51,897 --> 01:16:52,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have been wrong.

904
01:16:54,098 --> 01:16:57,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like to admit when I'm wrong, but apparently I was wrong.

905
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to do with Avatar, that movie that came out.

906
01:17:00,981 --> 01:17:04,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember I was coming out here saying, oh, this movie's probably going to bomb.

907
01:17:04,642 --> 01:17:06,363
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's going to fucking care about Avatar.

908
01:17:07,483 --> 01:17:09,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a 70-something million at the box office.

909
01:17:10,837 --> 01:17:11,678
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

910
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:29,541
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

911
01:17:59,372 --> 01:18:00,533
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

912
01:18:22,888 --> 01:18:23,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

913
01:18:45,134 --> 01:18:45,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

914
01:19:06,118 --> 01:19:08,060
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

915
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:25,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Walk over to get my salt, what is there?

916
01:19:25,999 --> 01:19:26,659
[SPEAKER_13]: A butter pump.

917
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you can put as much fucking butter on this popcorn as you want.

918
01:19:31,002 --> 01:19:39,008
[SPEAKER_13]: And, not only that, they have the season, you know, the different season popcorn toppings that normally at the UA would charge you to get a little, like, container of it.

919
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:39,568
[SPEAKER_13]: All free.

920
01:19:41,049 --> 01:19:42,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Unlimited butter on this thing.

921
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,191
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, oh my god, this is the greatest theater ever.

922
01:19:44,411 --> 01:19:46,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, all you can eat butter?

923
01:19:47,494 --> 01:19:47,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

924
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:50,965
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

925
01:20:14,372 --> 01:20:16,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the directions?

926
01:20:16,653 --> 01:20:18,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know how they have directions on how to wash your hands?

927
01:20:18,534 --> 01:20:19,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there was no directions.

928
01:20:19,494 --> 01:20:20,415
[SPEAKER_13]: It just said topping.

929
01:20:20,535 --> 01:20:22,035
[SPEAKER_13]: It did not say butter topping.

930
01:20:22,216 --> 01:20:23,176
[SPEAKER_13]: It just said topping.

931
01:20:23,456 --> 01:20:25,857
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, well, this could be, like, anything.

932
01:20:26,758 --> 01:20:29,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's some people in chat saying, this isn't news, Loki.

933
01:20:29,759 --> 01:20:30,639
[SPEAKER_04]: My theater does that.

934
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, none of ours do, so it's news for me.

935
01:20:34,901 --> 01:20:36,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the ultimate question.

936
01:20:36,642 --> 01:20:38,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there bacon seasoning?

937
01:20:38,883 --> 01:20:40,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that I'm aware of, but, you know...

938
01:20:42,245 --> 01:20:43,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Steps, baby steps.

939
01:20:43,185 --> 01:20:43,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, I see.

940
01:20:43,826 --> 01:20:45,046
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a step in the right direction.

941
01:20:45,647 --> 01:20:47,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not bite off more than we can chew.

942
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:48,908
[SPEAKER_13]: And bacon salt's not that good.

943
01:20:49,008 --> 01:20:49,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Trust me.

944
01:20:50,329 --> 01:20:54,791
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, as cool of a concept as bacon salt is, it does not taste like bacon.

945
01:20:56,127 --> 01:20:56,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

946
01:20:57,687 --> 01:21:01,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more topics tonight, some other news stories.

947
01:21:02,069 --> 01:21:03,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had to say that about Avatar.

948
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:08,571
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can man up and admit when I was wrong, and I may have been wrong about Avatar.

949
01:21:08,591 --> 01:21:12,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say I was wrong about Avatar because I haven't seen it yet, but I may have been wrong about it.

950
01:21:13,732 --> 01:21:14,072
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

951
01:21:14,152 --> 01:21:14,792
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty good.

952
01:21:14,812 --> 01:21:16,513
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd go see it in the theater and in 3D.

953
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:46,338
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to see it in 3D I will see it in 3D I promise but I also have to see Princess and the Frog because I did get to meet Princess Tiana this weekend and she's mighty fierce and I heard some of the songs from Princess and the Frog in the little street show they do I really want to see Princess and the Frog so that's at the top of my list then maybe Avatar if my mom doesn't drag me to see Precious on Christmas which is likely how about some gaming news less movies more games yes

954
01:21:48,042 --> 01:21:51,323
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess we got some rapid fire news to go into here.

955
01:21:51,803 --> 01:21:52,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

956
01:21:53,103 --> 01:21:59,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Starting things off, Dead or Alive is coming to the PSP, but not what you might think.

957
01:21:59,364 --> 01:22:05,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Dead or Alive Paradise, which is Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, minus the volleyball.

958
01:22:05,966 --> 01:22:12,087
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just Dead or Alive giggling girls in bikinis jumping around, watching their boobs move.

959
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,868
[SPEAKER_13]: to music the game.

960
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:18,129
[SPEAKER_13]: So, that's awesome.

961
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:20,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Tecmo.

962
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:23,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they just call it Boob Physics the game?

963
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:25,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that would be offensive.

964
01:22:26,171 --> 01:22:26,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

965
01:22:27,732 --> 01:22:31,553
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, so it'll be coming out Spring 2010 and it's awesome.

966
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:33,794
[SPEAKER_13]: That's innovation right there.

967
01:22:33,974 --> 01:22:34,314
[SPEAKER_13]: PSP 4000?

968
01:22:34,374 --> 01:22:34,554
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

969
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:34,714
[SPEAKER_13]: That.

970
01:22:37,281 --> 01:22:57,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of fake boobs, Playboy has done their annual Girls of Video Games, their 2010 spread, and this year they'll be featuring women from such games as God of War, Crimecraft, The Saboteur, Dante's Inferno, Mafia 2, and Heavy Rain, including some characters I don't know because I haven't played those games yet.

971
01:22:58,651 --> 01:22:59,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Skylar, St.

972
01:22:59,531 --> 01:23:00,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Clair from The Saboteur...

973
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:08,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Madison Page, I guess the main character from Heavy Rain, is new in there as well.

974
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:17,611
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want to see some fake naked boobies, I guess, then pick up the January-February issue of Playboy.

975
01:23:17,631 --> 01:23:19,373
[SPEAKER_13]: So now they're skipping months in Playboy?

976
01:23:19,513 --> 01:23:20,774
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, has it come down to that?

977
01:23:20,794 --> 01:23:21,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it bi-monthly now?

978
01:23:22,235 --> 01:23:22,556
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

979
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:35,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I still don't understand the idea of buying Playboy for video game rendered characters, but I suppose either way you buy the magazine, the girls are fake.

980
01:23:35,314 --> 01:23:40,497
[SPEAKER_13]: They have Tara Reid on the cover, but I bet you she's not topless, even though she's a slut.

981
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:45,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it be bad if I said, yeah, she is topless because I saw the pictures?

982
01:23:46,841 --> 01:23:47,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, awesome.

983
01:23:47,742 --> 01:23:50,824
[SPEAKER_13]: But still, that's not like... I don't know.

984
01:23:51,672 --> 01:23:53,873
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about as real as the video game magazine spread.

985
01:23:53,913 --> 01:23:54,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

986
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:55,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

987
01:23:55,934 --> 01:24:00,357
[SPEAKER_13]: And finally, this Thursday, we're going to be getting some wonderful holiday treats as well.

988
01:24:00,877 --> 01:24:12,703
[SPEAKER_13]: On the 22nd, not only will we be getting the download content for LittleBigPlanet, which is going to be all sorts of awesome, but we'll be getting the Gran Turismo 5 Time Trial Challenge.

989
01:24:12,803 --> 01:24:17,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, if you have a Japanese account, you can download that right now, and it's in English.

990
01:24:18,146 --> 01:24:18,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

991
01:24:18,946 --> 01:24:47,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Puzzle Get In which I think came out last week on the Puzzle to Destroy All Puzzles Puzzle Get In Puzzle Get In Let's see, also there will be of course Guitar Hero 5 songs High Speed Soul by Not A Surf, Sister Jack by Spoon, Cut Your Hair by Pavement and the Indie Rock Track Pack featuring all three of those as well um

992
01:24:49,036 --> 01:24:53,780
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, of course, the download content, which is really the most important thing.

993
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,364
[SPEAKER_13]: The PlayStation 1 Classic, though, this week is going to be Final Fantasy VIII, and that's pretty awesome.

994
01:24:58,724 --> 01:24:59,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Woohoo!

995
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:02,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So, that'll be coming out on... Wait, Final Fantasy VIII?

996
01:25:02,768 --> 01:25:02,948
[SPEAKER_04]: VIII.

997
01:25:03,068 --> 01:25:03,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

998
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:06,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's not Final Fantasy IX.

999
01:25:06,411 --> 01:25:07,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they just skipped ahead to IX.

1000
01:25:08,263 --> 01:25:09,904
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, Final Fantasy IX wasn't that good.

1001
01:25:09,924 --> 01:25:11,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we ignored that VIII happened.

1002
01:25:11,546 --> 01:25:12,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, I liked VIII.

1003
01:25:12,486 --> 01:25:13,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked VIII.

1004
01:25:14,348 --> 01:25:15,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just being dramatic.

1005
01:25:15,369 --> 01:25:18,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Except the last disc bored the crap out of me.

1006
01:25:18,892 --> 01:25:19,912
[SPEAKER_04]: VIII had a good story.

1007
01:25:20,153 --> 01:25:21,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all know how I feel about the battle system.

1008
01:25:21,894 --> 01:25:24,416
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't, I've ranted about it like 50 times in the history of this show.

1009
01:25:24,456 --> 01:25:26,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I got so tired of seeing Mob Bros.

1010
01:25:26,978 --> 01:25:30,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, I was like, they could not have come up with a better name for this stupid, ugly creature.

1011
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:32,383
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, of course, some PSP minis.

1012
01:25:32,443 --> 01:25:37,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Hercules, Chariot Racing, and Spot the Differences is the other game.

1013
01:25:38,823 --> 01:25:40,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

1014
01:25:40,884 --> 01:25:42,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Spot the Differences?

1015
01:25:43,766 --> 01:25:44,646
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the name of the game.

1016
01:25:44,786 --> 01:25:45,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Spot the Differences.

1017
01:25:46,927 --> 01:25:48,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I even need to crack a joke here?

1018
01:25:48,668 --> 01:25:50,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the jokes write themselves.

1019
01:25:50,349 --> 01:25:51,730
[SPEAKER_13]: They have the PSP 2000 and the PSP Go.

1020
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:53,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, what, one's crap?

1021
01:25:53,431 --> 01:25:53,651
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

1022
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:55,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Spot the Differences.

1023
01:25:59,141 --> 01:26:08,387
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be awesome if we could make a game like that and just like completely obvious differences like, you know, one's a puppy, one's a Hindenburg disaster, you know, this ridiculous stuff.

1024
01:26:09,407 --> 01:26:12,249
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be sweet.

1025
01:26:12,269 --> 01:26:13,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy's less violent, right?

1026
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:13,790
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

1027
01:26:18,493 --> 01:26:21,875
[SPEAKER_04]: One's a picture of Brittany Murphy, one's a picture of Heath... Never mind, I better not go there.

1028
01:26:21,995 --> 01:26:22,295
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1029
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:24,170
[SPEAKER_13]: She's a chick.

1030
01:26:25,891 --> 01:26:27,331
[SPEAKER_13]: She didn't die from a drug overdose.

1031
01:26:27,411 --> 01:26:28,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, no.

1032
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:29,292
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not probably it.

1033
01:26:29,672 --> 01:26:30,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on.

1034
01:26:31,552 --> 01:26:32,252
[SPEAKER_13]: She was the Joker.

1035
01:26:34,293 --> 01:26:34,453
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1036
01:26:36,793 --> 01:26:38,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I found something else I was looking for.

1037
01:26:38,974 --> 01:26:41,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought you found the differences we were talking about.

1038
01:26:41,615 --> 01:26:46,456
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I found something for you, Rob, that I wanted you to play during break and you didn't, so you have to play it after the show.

1039
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:47,754
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1040
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:02,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks for her family I don't care The end

1041
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:29,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Does Tara Reid sing any music?

1042
01:27:30,386 --> 01:27:31,087
[SPEAKER_13]: You can put her in there.

1043
01:27:31,467 --> 01:27:31,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1044
01:27:32,888 --> 01:27:33,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1045
01:27:35,911 --> 01:27:36,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1046
01:27:39,855 --> 01:27:42,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like just suddenly the Hindenburg disaster.

1047
01:27:42,678 --> 01:27:43,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on, hold on.

1048
01:27:43,519 --> 01:27:44,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you spot the difference?

1049
01:27:45,621 --> 01:27:49,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's program, Hindenburg disaster.

1050
01:27:50,706 --> 01:27:52,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you spot the difference?

1051
01:27:55,379 --> 01:27:57,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathwishing might have found it in chat.

1052
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:01,103
[SPEAKER_04]: It said, pro tip, Hindenburg powered by puppies with cute kitten pilots.

1053
01:28:04,085 --> 01:28:05,005
[SPEAKER_13]: I want a picture of that.

1054
01:28:05,966 --> 01:28:06,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1055
01:28:07,627 --> 01:28:08,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1056
01:28:09,548 --> 01:28:13,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get in some more last minute, or not last minute.

1057
01:28:13,591 --> 01:28:14,872
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I want the show to be over.

1058
01:28:16,793 --> 01:28:41,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob Rapid Fire Topics Hey, there's a game called Zero Day Attack in Earth Coming to Xbox Live Marketplace on December 23rd That's right, Martians invade the Earth, shoot them up, bang bang, blow up Not the type of game that Square Enix is usually known for But, here's the kicker about the game It uses satellite photography So if you want to blow up real things Have a blast Just don't

1059
01:28:42,281 --> 01:28:43,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1060
01:29:02,011 --> 01:29:06,816
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be... I can just see horrific YouTubes coming of this game.

1061
01:29:06,836 --> 01:29:07,556
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

1062
01:29:07,596 --> 01:29:10,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Horrific YouTubes even worse than the joke I told earlier.

1063
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:11,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow...

1064
01:29:12,972 --> 01:29:18,496
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you were offended by my earlier joke, I have to say to you, well, excuse me, Internet.

1065
01:29:18,996 --> 01:29:26,561
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, that old catchphrase, excuse me, princess coin from the Legend of Zelda cartoons, which used to run as like the Friday special on the Super Mario Bros.

1066
01:29:26,581 --> 01:29:27,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Show.

1067
01:29:27,822 --> 01:29:34,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're kind of younger, you probably don't remember this unless you kind of seen it in a nostalgia post or whatever.

1068
01:29:34,667 --> 01:29:36,448
[SPEAKER_04]: But I certainly remember this from when I was younger.

1069
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:39,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet a lot of our listeners remember this because I think I was around like 10.

1070
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:41,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of our listeners, you know, 5, 6, probably or 10.

1071
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:41,812
[SPEAKER_04]: On Fridays?

1072
01:29:43,348 --> 01:29:48,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they would have the Zelda cartoon on Fridays, because the rest of the week was Mario cartoons, but Friday was Zelda cartoons.

1073
01:29:48,431 --> 01:29:54,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, those came out on DVD a while back, and if you bought those, well, it sucks to be you, because they're all free on Hulu now.

1074
01:29:54,755 --> 01:30:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to see these cartoons and what they're all about, if you just want to see the lols that is this, although I will say this, this was definitely a step above the Phillips CDI cutscenes.

1075
01:30:05,721 --> 01:30:07,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were just...

1076
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:08,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1077
01:30:08,823 --> 01:30:10,304
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like I drew in paint.

1078
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:11,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1079
01:30:11,885 --> 01:30:12,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were wow.

1080
01:30:12,546 --> 01:30:17,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are not available on Hulu, but the Zelda stuff is now on Hulu.

1081
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:22,092
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to relive your youth or have another youth, I don't know.

1082
01:30:22,472 --> 01:30:24,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, also in

1083
01:30:25,774 --> 01:30:26,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1084
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:45,740
[SPEAKER_04]: G.O.G.

1085
01:31:11,218 --> 01:31:12,159
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be something completely different.

1086
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:13,580
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that you said it, I thought you said photography.

1087
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't speak tonight.

1088
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:15,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is.

1089
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:17,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob can speak good.

1090
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:19,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I might need to see a doctor.

1091
01:31:20,284 --> 01:31:23,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, DarkSakura, do you have some rapid-fire news for us?

1092
01:31:24,306 --> 01:31:26,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I do, Rob.

1093
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't make me twist your arm or nothing.

1094
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:31,491
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't bring us cupcakes, by the way.

1095
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, boo-hoo, I'm sorry.

1096
01:31:35,621 --> 01:31:38,983
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, how about some more stuff for the iPhone?

1097
01:31:39,524 --> 01:31:54,574
[SPEAKER_10]: There is Need for Speed Shift coming out for iPhone for $9.99, 20 cars, 18 tracks, tilt functionality, which means lack of functionality, and you can play over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

1098
01:31:55,054 --> 01:31:55,714
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.

1099
01:31:56,895 --> 01:31:57,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I'm kind of...

1100
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:00,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1101
01:32:21,599 --> 01:32:27,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally actually really dug the last Ridge Racer that came out on iPhone, even though I didn't play it too long because I did get a little pissed off.

1102
01:32:28,162 --> 01:32:30,443
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, give it a go, let us know what you think.

1103
01:32:31,003 --> 01:32:31,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, um...

1104
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:40,725
[SPEAKER_10]: One other thing, and this has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with Rock Band because it's about Rock Band.

1105
01:32:41,525 --> 01:32:47,349
[SPEAKER_10]: The holiday lineup for Rock Band Weekly is going to be Weezer.

1106
01:32:49,691 --> 01:32:54,354
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have songs from Limp Bizkit, The Offspring, and Yellow Card.

1107
01:32:55,214 --> 01:32:59,177
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't forget, Rock Band Unplugged download content is on hiatus.

1108
01:33:01,192 --> 01:33:04,835
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's what we're looking at for the Weezer pack.

1109
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:10,579
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Beverly Hills, Let It All Hang Out, and if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.

1110
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,463
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Limp Bizkit, Build a Bridge, The Offspring, A Lot Like Me, and Yellow Card Ocean Avenue.

1111
01:33:16,184 --> 01:33:19,266
[SPEAKER_10]: The latter three will be 160 points.

1112
01:33:19,326 --> 01:33:24,070
[SPEAKER_10]: The pack for Weezer is 440 or 160 for each, again.

1113
01:33:24,951 --> 01:33:27,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And they are also available for LEGO Rock Band.

1114
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:30,295
[SPEAKER_13]: The End!

1115
01:33:30,876 --> 01:33:37,020
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say that Reduce is pretty awesome to be coming to the iPhone, but it's no Daytona.

1116
01:33:43,044 --> 01:33:45,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving right along into other topics tonight.

1117
01:33:45,405 --> 01:33:46,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how about some Twitter topics?

1118
01:33:51,509 --> 01:33:55,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we request your ideas and suggestions for topics over Twitter.

1119
01:33:57,342 --> 01:34:00,005
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw305 sent us this article about Gamers attempt to catch every Pokemon in 72 hours for charity.

1120
01:34:12,919 --> 01:34:16,562
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, some very bored gamers have... No, it's for charity, you can't say that.

1121
01:34:16,862 --> 01:34:23,248
[SPEAKER_04]: But some gamers have decided to catch every Pokemon in existence, 493 of them to be exact, in 72 hours!

1122
01:34:23,988 --> 01:34:24,989
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all for charity.

1123
01:34:25,029 --> 01:34:30,073
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually not for Child's Play, as a lot of these recent marathons have been for, which is obviously a great charity.

1124
01:34:30,374 --> 01:34:32,075
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for a different one, it's called Allie's House.

1125
01:34:32,155 --> 01:34:40,022
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an Oklahoma-based children's cancer foundation that provides support for families with medical expenses, short-term housing, and other types of needs.

1126
01:34:40,523 --> 01:34:42,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a charity that involves killing sims.

1127
01:34:51,088 --> 01:34:52,649
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be an idea for a marathon there.

1128
01:34:53,249 --> 01:34:55,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Put up a proposal, Loki, and bring it to the show.

1129
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:56,310
[SPEAKER_04]: We might do this.

1130
01:34:57,310 --> 01:35:02,872
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw also sent us a quick link to an article that Blizzard will definitely work on a console game at some point.

1131
01:35:03,812 --> 01:35:08,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in other words, not StarCraft Ghost, but like for real this time, some type of console game.

1132
01:35:09,234 --> 01:35:11,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, really, I think the title of this says it all.

1133
01:35:11,215 --> 01:35:12,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they've done so many great PC games.

1134
01:35:13,455 --> 01:35:15,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's about time for them to do a console game.

1135
01:35:17,142 --> 01:35:20,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just wanted to clarify, I don't see the PC market as being bad.

1136
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:22,707
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have 12 million players 10 years ago.

1137
01:35:23,087 --> 01:35:26,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever the format, console or PC, I think if there's a good game, it's going to be played.

1138
01:35:27,171 --> 01:35:29,153
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on PC because it's familiar to us.

1139
01:35:29,793 --> 01:35:32,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Console, we have to worry about those unfamiliar things.

1140
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming to us from Twitter, from Deathwishing, three questions from Deathwishing.

1141
01:35:39,883 --> 01:35:42,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I buy LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year?

1142
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, if you like platformers like Mario Brothers, yes, yes, yes.

1143
01:35:45,993 --> 01:35:46,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great game.

1144
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:48,555
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my game of the year, the year it came out.

1145
01:35:48,956 --> 01:35:54,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus, you get the beta for Mod Nation Racers, so you gotta act quick, because that just started on the 18th.

1146
01:35:55,922 --> 01:35:58,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Socom Confrontation, I guess.

1147
01:35:59,025 --> 01:35:59,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a game?

1148
01:35:59,785 --> 01:36:00,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Confrontation.

1149
01:36:00,486 --> 01:36:01,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Confrontation.

1150
01:36:01,307 --> 01:36:01,947
[SPEAKER_04]: He spelled it wrong then.

1151
01:36:02,008 --> 01:36:02,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Confrontation.

1152
01:36:03,749 --> 01:36:05,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And did you guys try out Dante's Inferno?

1153
01:36:06,091 --> 01:36:07,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not try out Dante's Inferno.

1154
01:36:07,892 --> 01:36:08,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded the demo.

1155
01:36:08,953 --> 01:36:10,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it yet because I was gone all weekend.

1156
01:36:10,734 --> 01:36:12,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard it's pretty terrible.

1157
01:36:12,635 --> 01:36:13,636
[SPEAKER_13]: I've already played God of War.

1158
01:36:13,656 --> 01:36:13,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1159
01:36:15,217 --> 01:36:16,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you checked out the demo?

1160
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:16,998
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I haven't.

1161
01:36:17,658 --> 01:36:18,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard it's pretty bad.

1162
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

1163
01:36:20,821 --> 01:36:23,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I don't like to base games purely off the demo.

1164
01:36:23,883 --> 01:36:28,186
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got a level of... Well, it's going to be good.

1165
01:36:28,766 --> 01:36:29,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll probably play it.

1166
01:36:29,546 --> 01:36:30,107
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know...

1167
01:36:30,936 --> 01:36:32,117
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Conan the Librarian

1168
01:36:55,933 --> 01:36:56,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1169
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:56,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Good deal.

1170
01:36:57,474 --> 01:36:59,175
[SPEAKER_04]: GamerGirl sends us a tweet.

1171
01:36:59,215 --> 01:37:00,896
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your take on Final Fantasy XIII?

1172
01:37:00,996 --> 01:37:01,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Good or not so good?

1173
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:03,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't tell you.

1174
01:37:03,197 --> 01:37:04,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't import the game.

1175
01:37:04,177 --> 01:37:07,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't want to pay those types of fees when the game's coming out here in a few months.

1176
01:37:07,339 --> 01:37:09,140
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like $100 since it's in Japanese only.

1177
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,661
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't justify doing that.

1178
01:37:11,821 --> 01:37:19,625
[SPEAKER_13]: But the demo we played a few months ago and... The demo was fun, but once again, you know, I played the demo a few times and I'm like, why did I buy this?

1179
01:37:20,486 --> 01:37:20,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.

1180
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:21,817
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

1181
01:37:22,018 --> 01:37:23,579
[SPEAKER_04]: But that wasn't anything about the game.

1182
01:37:23,619 --> 01:37:26,602
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just why did you spend so much money on a demo?

1183
01:37:26,662 --> 01:37:31,187
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, okay, I don't know what's really going on here.

1184
01:37:31,267 --> 01:37:31,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1185
01:37:31,627 --> 01:37:32,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at some other tweets.

1186
01:37:32,528 --> 01:37:36,532
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple things of stuff that we did earlier in the show and that is basically it.

1187
01:37:36,592 --> 01:37:38,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys for your tweets.

1188
01:37:38,233 --> 01:37:39,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we'll take some more next week.

1189
01:37:39,655 --> 01:37:43,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.

1190
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:45,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, back to some more news.

1191
01:37:46,516 --> 01:37:49,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Nintendo has some interesting things going on.

1192
01:37:50,178 --> 01:37:56,742
[SPEAKER_13]: They've announced their new titles coming out in the first part of the year.

1193
01:37:56,762 --> 01:38:00,985
[SPEAKER_13]: 2010, of course, they're going to launch their first Wii game.

1194
01:38:01,005 --> 01:38:06,128
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be Endless Ocean 2, the sequel to the Deep Sea Diving Sim.

1195
01:38:06,608 --> 01:38:08,169
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really play a lot of the first one.

1196
01:38:08,209 --> 01:38:13,612
[SPEAKER_13]: It was kind of neat, very pretty, but not something I really want to jump into for the next one.

1197
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:40,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, some DS titles, of course, the newest, I guess, I wouldn't really call them brand new, but, uh, Pokemon Heart, Gold, and SoulSilver, the kind of remix of, uh, Gold and Silver, and, um, there's some other cool things, uh, WiiWare titles, including And Yet It Moves, of course, um, like, you know, Super Meat Boy is kind of cool, they also have some third-party stuff listed as well, um,

1198
01:38:42,153 --> 01:38:43,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing to stand out from Konami.

1199
01:38:43,774 --> 01:38:53,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, for example, we've got Dance Dance Revolution, although I believe that's... No, maybe that is a new title, Dance Dance Revolution.

1200
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:57,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard there is some controversy going on right now because I think that list came out.

1201
01:38:58,504 --> 01:39:05,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now that brand new Dance Dance Revolution is only slated for PS3 and Xbox and wasn't announced for Wii.

1202
01:39:06,409 --> 01:39:09,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like, was this the announcement or what?

1203
01:39:09,411 --> 01:39:22,598
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, the other thing, too, with Dance... I could see it probably coming to the Wii, but, you know, I remember before they were kind of lumping in all those games, you know, before at E3, as Dance Dance Revolution 1, Dance Dance Revolution for the Wii ended up being hot as Party 3, so... Right.

1204
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:29,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then same for the PlayStation 2, it ended up being X2, so... Eh, it might not be entirely accurate, but that's alright.

1205
01:39:30,383 --> 01:39:30,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1206
01:39:31,713 --> 01:39:41,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, as a long time music game fan and someone who's been critical of DDR over the past few years, I am interested in the reboot game that they're doing on Xbox 360 and PS3 because it is a reboot.

1207
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:44,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I've been saying DDR has needed for about five years.

1208
01:39:45,784 --> 01:39:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1209
01:39:46,445 --> 01:39:50,608
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR hasn't just needed a reboot, it's needed a resuscitation and a kick in the ass.

1210
01:39:51,289 --> 01:39:54,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will see if this is it, although I will say the expectations are very low.

1211
01:39:54,992 --> 01:39:57,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So Konami doesn't have to do much to impress me.

1212
01:39:57,453 --> 01:39:57,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

1213
01:39:59,059 --> 01:39:59,940
[SPEAKER_13]: WarioWare DIY WarioWare DIY

1214
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:19,376
[SPEAKER_13]: on different YouTubes.

1215
01:40:19,897 --> 01:40:22,978
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's going to be available as well in March.

1216
01:40:23,699 --> 01:40:37,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally, just in time for Valentine's Day, you're going to be getting pink and blue Wii remotes are going to be released as well I believe just before Valentine's Day.

1217
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:41,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, just as I always wanted a pink Wiimote.

1218
01:40:42,609 --> 01:40:44,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well then remind me to get you one, Rob.

1219
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:45,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, that's what I want for Christmas.

1220
01:40:45,751 --> 01:40:47,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn, they're not out until February.

1221
01:40:47,672 --> 01:40:47,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

1222
01:40:48,632 --> 01:40:49,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe for my birthday.

1223
01:40:49,832 --> 01:40:52,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Now if they put out a pink console, that might sell a little bit.

1224
01:40:53,134 --> 01:40:58,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

1225
01:40:58,616 --> 01:41:01,497
[SPEAKER_07]: The blue one's actually kind of cute.

1226
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:04,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember at E3 when they first showed the Wii?

1227
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:06,399
[SPEAKER_07]: How there were the blue ones?

1228
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:08,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, there were all the different colors.

1229
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:12,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But they didn't need to do that because the system sold like fucking nuts anyway.

1230
01:41:13,202 --> 01:41:16,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And the curse of the white system did not hurt it.

1231
01:41:18,345 --> 01:41:27,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, because the, well, no, the Saturn, well, I don't know what it is, alright, the Saturn in Japan came out in white.

1232
01:41:28,496 --> 01:41:29,577
[SPEAKER_10]: We got it over here in black.

1233
01:41:29,858 --> 01:41:30,338
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened?

1234
01:41:30,879 --> 01:41:31,179
Poop.

1235
01:41:31,599 --> 01:41:31,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead.

1236
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,801
[SPEAKER_10]: So, see, they learned.

1237
01:41:32,821 --> 01:41:33,261
[SPEAKER_10]: They learned.

1238
01:41:33,542 --> 01:41:33,882
[SPEAKER_10]: They learned.

1239
01:41:34,827 --> 01:41:36,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Ziii has been trademarked.

1240
01:41:36,108 --> 01:41:36,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, rumors run rampant.

1241
01:41:36,808 --> 01:41:37,428
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG, the Wii HD is the Ziii!

1242
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,521
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way though, just so you know, Z actually was trademarked in 2006.

1243
01:42:05,442 --> 01:42:15,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Also trademarked, the B, the C, the we, the ye, and the Z. This Sesame Street.

1244
01:42:16,245 --> 01:42:18,065
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought the we was oi.

1245
01:42:18,305 --> 01:42:22,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Oi, oi, oi, like a punk rock system.

1246
01:42:22,786 --> 01:42:25,727
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's like a... It's for the hardcore gamer, the oi, oi.

1247
01:42:26,087 --> 01:42:26,828
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's French.

1248
01:42:27,628 --> 01:42:27,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

1249
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:33,213
[SPEAKER_10]: But, but, you know, also though, keep in mind, it's like, uh, you know, that totally made me think of Clue.

1250
01:42:34,173 --> 01:42:34,373
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1251
01:42:34,553 --> 01:42:35,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Oui, oui, madame?

1252
01:42:35,614 --> 01:42:36,274
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.

1253
01:42:36,294 --> 01:42:37,194
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I know this?

1254
01:42:37,875 --> 01:42:43,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they neglected the V because that's the one that the Chinese knockoff is called the V, isn't it?

1255
01:42:43,297 --> 01:42:43,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1256
01:42:43,757 --> 01:42:44,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops, forgot that one.

1257
01:42:45,157 --> 01:42:52,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and most importantly, uh, you forgot the P. Where's the P?

1258
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:53,641
[SPEAKER_07]: In the toilet!

1259
01:42:54,241 --> 01:42:54,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

1260
01:42:56,152 --> 01:43:00,916
[SPEAKER_04]: and they missed... Now see what's funny, somebody in chat said they forgot She, XII.

1261
01:43:00,996 --> 01:43:02,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that the name of a game on PlayStation?

1262
01:43:03,298 --> 01:43:03,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say.

1263
01:43:03,979 --> 01:43:05,900
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that was XIII.

1264
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:08,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so XII was not taken, but XIII was.

1265
01:43:10,924 --> 01:43:13,306
[SPEAKER_13]: She, though... It sounds familiar.

1266
01:43:13,507 --> 01:43:13,867
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1267
01:43:15,011 --> 01:43:30,148
[SPEAKER_13]: The Z thing though, and unfortunately I don't have the ability to put that clip on our stream right now, but Z reminds me of Charlie the Unicorn, the second one, where they go and they meet Z and they start speaking Spanish to the Z. I remember that.

1268
01:43:30,989 --> 01:43:33,491
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be totally appropriate for this, but...

1269
01:43:35,361 --> 01:44:03,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathwishing in chat says the Nintendo oi with oi circle pit run and mosh your face off see it's for the hardcore gamer that's exactly what it is we're gonna do another story real quick here but I wanted to introduce someone who just walked into studio tonight say hello to Tiara why hello there how are you I'm good thank you thanks for joining us tonight how have you been you're tardy you know we start at 6 o'clock right yeah I know I went on a date wait hold on hold on aren't you just visiting

1270
01:44:03,905 --> 01:44:07,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm visiting Jamie and I went out on a date with not Jamie.

1271
01:44:08,731 --> 01:44:10,033
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a very naughty girl.

1272
01:44:10,293 --> 01:44:10,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have fun?

1273
01:44:11,034 --> 01:44:11,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.

1274
01:44:11,655 --> 01:44:17,322
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw The Blind Side, which I expected to hate, but apparently I like Sandra Bullock when she's not in a funny movie.

1275
01:44:17,802 --> 01:44:18,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1276
01:44:18,403 --> 01:44:19,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she's not funny.

1277
01:44:19,665 --> 01:44:20,045
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1278
01:44:21,158 --> 01:44:23,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I have played the hell out of Final Fantasy IV The After Years.

1279
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:23,961
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is so awesome!

1280
01:44:45,001 --> 01:44:45,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I never finished it.

1281
01:44:45,942 --> 01:44:48,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel bad because it was pretty badass, the parts that I played.

1282
01:44:49,004 --> 01:44:52,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the opening chapter and I think I played a little bit of Rydia's side story.

1283
01:44:52,506 --> 01:44:54,948
[SPEAKER_04]: But lots and lots of side stories to beat in that game.

1284
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:56,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have to be honest.

1285
01:44:56,048 --> 01:44:57,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't buy all of them.

1286
01:44:57,189 --> 01:45:01,592
[SPEAKER_01]: But I played through the opening chapter, which is like the first three.

1287
01:45:01,672 --> 01:45:05,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I played through part of Rydia's chapter before I drove up here.

1288
01:45:05,695 --> 01:45:11,959
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to go home and play that and have the Wii Fit tell me how fat I am because it loves to do that.

1289
01:45:12,772 --> 01:45:17,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's always kind of a downer to get on Wii Fit, and then you watch as your character goes, whoop!

1290
01:45:17,818 --> 01:45:18,859
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh!

1291
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:21,462
[SPEAKER_04]: But surely that hasn't happened for you.

1292
01:45:21,522 --> 01:45:25,547
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually look like you've lost a little bit, so Wii Fit's been working for you.

1293
01:45:25,767 --> 01:45:26,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's fun.

1294
01:45:26,588 --> 01:45:28,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a master of the hula hoop now.

1295
01:45:29,151 --> 01:45:30,232
[SPEAKER_01]: If only in real life.

1296
01:45:30,252 --> 01:45:32,675
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good, useful skill, but no.

1297
01:45:33,311 --> 01:45:33,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Eatsleepgeek.com Cool.

1298
01:45:33,851 --> 01:45:34,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Who runs that?

1299
01:45:34,332 --> 01:45:34,712
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of geeks?

1300
01:45:54,983 --> 01:45:56,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would have to say so.

1301
01:45:56,444 --> 01:45:57,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a clever name.

1302
01:45:57,785 --> 01:45:58,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1303
01:45:59,325 --> 01:46:00,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we ever going to start?

1304
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:05,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I've heard rumors that someday there might be a Giggling Girl comic book show of sorts.

1305
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:09,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Jamie and I had talked about that.

1306
01:46:09,331 --> 01:46:14,914
[SPEAKER_01]: We had talked about doing kind of like a mini podcast for one of our weekly features for my blog.

1307
01:46:15,574 --> 01:46:23,420
[SPEAKER_01]: But we never have time and of course I'm trying to graduate next year so I'm taking like eight classes in the semester.

1308
01:46:23,701 --> 01:46:24,741
[SPEAKER_04]: She's already got a show.

1309
01:46:24,821 --> 01:46:26,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit trying to ninja the hosts.

1310
01:46:27,263 --> 01:46:28,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit trying to ninja them into your show.

1311
01:46:29,585 --> 01:46:30,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1312
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:32,207
[SPEAKER_07]: We're using that computer.

1313
01:46:34,349 --> 01:46:36,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard they're going to borrow the show computer to do a side project.

1314
01:46:36,951 --> 01:46:38,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's awesome.

1315
01:46:38,572 --> 01:46:41,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys are able to find the time but certainly school is school.

1316
01:46:42,095 --> 01:46:42,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed.

1317
01:46:42,995 --> 01:46:43,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1318
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:52,401
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever need a guest who never reads comic books, I will totally come on and be like the gay guy on the show that says witty things.

1319
01:46:53,237 --> 01:46:54,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I will totally book you for that.

1320
01:46:54,578 --> 01:46:54,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

1321
01:46:54,878 --> 01:46:58,461
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be like, comics, I don't know anything about that, but Wolverine is hot.

1322
01:46:58,661 --> 01:47:01,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I need you to call my manager, though.

1323
01:47:01,443 --> 01:47:02,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get that all arranged.

1324
01:47:03,705 --> 01:47:04,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you my card.

1325
01:47:05,567 --> 01:47:06,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't call us.

1326
01:47:06,067 --> 01:47:06,447
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll call you.

1327
01:47:06,888 --> 01:47:07,208
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1328
01:47:08,609 --> 01:47:10,090
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but feel free, please, to pipe in.

1329
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:12,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we don't have a fourth mic in studio because we're a little ghetto.

1330
01:47:13,212 --> 01:47:15,014
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to say something, raise your hand.

1331
01:47:15,034 --> 01:47:16,075
[SPEAKER_04]: A little ghetto?

1332
01:47:16,555 --> 01:47:17,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Just reach your hand out and grab my mic.

1333
01:47:17,956 --> 01:47:18,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Or grab Loki.

1334
01:47:18,576 --> 01:47:19,057
[SPEAKER_04]: He's closest.

1335
01:47:19,777 --> 01:47:20,018
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1336
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:23,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, moving on with some more gaming news, DarkSakura.

1337
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:29,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, for the record, and completely off topic, you know how you're wondering if there was a game called Z?

1338
01:47:30,262 --> 01:47:36,863
[SPEAKER_10]: There was an alternate reality game that came out on the PS3 for PlayStation Home.

1339
01:47:36,883 --> 01:47:38,063
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1340
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:41,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Devil Dice was called Psy, which was spelled X-I.

1341
01:47:42,664 --> 01:47:45,484
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had X-I, X-I-I, and X-I-I-I.

1342
01:47:45,964 --> 01:47:46,684
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had stuff.

1343
01:47:46,804 --> 01:47:49,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would like to create X-I-I-I-I, patent pending.

1344
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:52,631
[SPEAKER_04]: What, 13?

1345
01:47:53,652 --> 01:47:54,834
[SPEAKER_04]: No, X-I-I-I-I, 14.

1346
01:47:54,914 --> 01:47:57,156
[SPEAKER_10]: So should it be X-I-V?

1347
01:47:58,178 --> 01:47:58,878
[SPEAKER_04]: You shut your mouth!

1348
01:48:01,401 --> 01:48:02,342
[SPEAKER_10]: La la la, okay.

1349
01:48:03,043 --> 01:48:04,905
[SPEAKER_10]: So how about my story, huh?

1350
01:48:04,925 --> 01:48:05,606
[SPEAKER_04]: How about your story?

1351
01:48:06,087 --> 01:48:06,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, how about that?

1352
01:48:07,769 --> 01:48:11,373
[SPEAKER_10]: How about a particular rumor about a game I'm particularly looking forward to?

1353
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:31,176
[SPEAKER_10]: For Super Street Fighter 4, the rumors that they're getting 10 new characters total is actually something based off of a clip from the Thummy2 stream that's showing a different list on here.

1354
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:35,820
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me see if I can't find who else might be included on here.

1355
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:48,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know for a fact that they're getting DJ and Feilong and Adon and Guy and Cody, right?

1356
01:48:49,667 --> 01:48:54,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they've announced any new ones, but there's like placeholders here, right?

1357
01:48:55,558 --> 01:49:01,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, see, there's four here that are completely blank, according to this.

1358
01:49:01,842 --> 01:49:06,945
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can actually link the clip to the chat room if they want to look at it.

1359
01:49:08,286 --> 01:49:10,868
[SPEAKER_10]: It definitely, I think, would be worth seeing.

1360
01:49:13,209 --> 01:49:16,811
[SPEAKER_10]: But from what I can tell on here... No, Dan, you can't talk to me right now.

1361
01:49:17,332 --> 01:49:17,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1362
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:20,614
[SPEAKER_10]: What I can tell on here is that...

1363
01:49:23,746 --> 01:49:33,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I recognized about everybody else on here, so I wouldn't think of who they could have put in unless they're adding in, like, Charlie and Rolento and maybe Hagar.

1364
01:49:33,578 --> 01:49:41,187
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting is that the game, we were only supposed to be getting, like, six, I think, in an earlier interview, or maybe it was seven or eight, but now it's up to ten.

1365
01:49:41,227 --> 01:49:42,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's almost like they can't put this down.

1366
01:49:43,229 --> 01:49:43,710
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't...

1367
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Getaway from this project, which is a good thing.

1368
01:49:46,714 --> 01:49:50,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It means that they really love it, but that's a lot of new characters, too.

1369
01:49:50,439 --> 01:49:52,202
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just these four empty slots on here.

1370
01:49:52,222 --> 01:49:55,346
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me wonder what's going to go in.

1371
01:49:55,386 --> 01:49:59,993
[SPEAKER_10]: This has to be from some kind of beta or demo on here.

1372
01:50:00,393 --> 01:50:04,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Hakan equals an Arab oil dude Ono talked about but hasn't been revealed yet

1373
01:50:25,855 --> 01:50:31,256
[SPEAKER_04]: and I've heard that rumor too that there was some type of like oil tycoon fighter in it as well.

1374
01:50:32,077 --> 01:50:34,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, GameGuru, is Charlie really dead or is he Jean Grey dead?

1375
01:50:36,658 --> 01:50:37,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Answer that.

1376
01:50:37,358 --> 01:50:40,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Street Fighter is like Heroes where people die but they don't ever like die.

1377
01:50:41,379 --> 01:50:43,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's like Heroes where they get their brains eaten.

1378
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:49,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe it's like Heroes where it starts to suck by the third season but then gets good again at the fourth season.

1379
01:50:49,621 --> 01:50:52,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I stopped watching it at the fourth season but apparently...

1380
01:50:54,014 --> 01:51:14,746
[SPEAKER_01]: of course you realize all I know about heroes is the brain eating and the cheerleader is like Wolverine look I'm just saying Street Fighter doesn't have Zachary Quinto that's all I'm saying ZQ or GTFO maybe it's like that episode of Heroes where Spock accidentally blows up Romulus and Nero goes back in time to find him

1381
01:51:15,734 --> 01:51:16,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

1382
01:51:16,815 --> 01:51:31,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, in an unrelated story that I don't think we covered yet, but did you hear about that, that ZQ actually announced this week at the Video Game Awards, he's going to be doing the voice for Star Trek Online, I guess like doing the opening narration or whatever, and I'm just like, he can talk to me anytime he wants.

1383
01:51:32,143 --> 01:51:35,224
[SPEAKER_13]: But he will be doing a William Shatner impression.

1384
01:51:35,324 --> 01:51:36,365
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

1385
01:51:36,965 --> 01:51:40,587
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, by the way, I have decided to get the Amazon one, because I want a Borg chick.

1386
01:51:41,567 --> 01:51:42,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fair enough.

1387
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:44,541
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1388
01:52:02,614 --> 01:52:08,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm going to totally out myself as a super nerd, but I read the Star Trek novels.

1389
01:52:08,798 --> 01:52:09,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Nerd!

1390
01:52:09,879 --> 01:52:16,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the novels, there's a half Vulcan who totally rejects her Vulcan side and is kind of sassy.

1391
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:19,426
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you could be sassy.

1392
01:52:20,567 --> 01:52:23,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't play MMOs and not be sassy.

1393
01:52:23,148 --> 01:52:23,909
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my thing.

1394
01:52:24,149 --> 01:52:25,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, we have to make the Olorians.

1395
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:27,972
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, and I'll have one of those.

1396
01:52:27,992 --> 01:52:30,013
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be sassy in the pants.

1397
01:52:30,073 --> 01:52:31,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to have a sassy Vulcan.

1398
01:52:31,581 --> 01:52:32,762
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be sassy in the pants.

1399
01:52:32,802 --> 01:52:33,202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1400
01:52:34,162 --> 01:52:34,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1401
01:52:34,863 --> 01:52:36,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I started playing WoW again, Rob.

1402
01:52:36,303 --> 01:52:36,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see that?

1403
01:52:36,924 --> 01:52:37,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucker.

1404
01:52:37,904 --> 01:52:38,484
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?

1405
01:52:38,825 --> 01:52:39,385
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going good.

1406
01:52:39,445 --> 01:52:41,046
[SPEAKER_01]: My priest is almost 43.

1407
01:52:41,926 --> 01:52:44,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using that dungeon finder thing.

1408
01:52:46,548 --> 01:52:47,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jamie's on the phone with Dan.

1409
01:52:48,329 --> 01:52:49,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be important.

1410
01:52:50,290 --> 01:52:51,511
[SPEAKER_04]: The dungeon finder's great, though.

1411
01:52:51,791 --> 01:52:53,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1412
01:52:53,332 --> 01:52:57,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I leveled from 37 to 42 in two days just doing that.

1413
01:52:57,114 --> 01:52:57,494
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice.

1414
01:52:58,479 --> 01:52:58,999
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't important.

1415
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:03,883
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, I am also getting Star Trek online, obviously, because I'm a big, huge nerd.

1416
01:53:04,484 --> 01:53:06,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV, we talked about earlier in the show.

1417
01:53:07,867 --> 01:53:08,047
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1418
01:53:11,229 --> 01:53:11,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

1419
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:12,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

1420
01:53:13,582 --> 01:53:15,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments in chat about the Sassy Vulcan.

1421
01:53:15,943 --> 01:53:20,326
[SPEAKER_04]: SalaciousPop says, instead of saying that's not logical, she says, so ignorant.

1422
01:53:21,646 --> 01:53:22,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So ignorant.

1423
01:53:22,987 --> 01:53:27,790
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob's character, live long and prosper, betch.

1424
01:53:30,351 --> 01:53:30,911
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.

1425
01:53:30,951 --> 01:53:31,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1426
01:53:32,052 --> 01:53:32,932
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens there.

1427
01:53:33,933 --> 01:53:37,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Tiger Claw is letting me know some specifics on that.

1428
01:53:37,454 --> 01:53:40,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, he's also doing the voice of the emergency medical hologram.

1429
01:53:40,856 --> 01:53:42,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I got to say, come on.

1430
01:53:42,756 --> 01:53:44,737
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who did it, what was his name?

1431
01:53:45,438 --> 01:53:50,140
[SPEAKER_04]: The emergency hologram program, Robert Picardo or whatever his name was in Voyager.

1432
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:54,481
[SPEAKER_04]: When you think emergency medical program, I always think of him.

1433
01:53:54,782 --> 01:53:57,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how they got him a cameo in First Contact?

1434
01:53:57,563 --> 01:53:58,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1435
01:53:58,601 --> 01:53:59,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan Lost My Copy

1436
01:54:26,713 --> 01:54:28,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, sorry, let's get into some other gaming news.

1437
01:54:28,794 --> 01:54:29,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple quick articles.

1438
01:54:29,615 --> 01:54:30,955
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get to the mailbag here very soon.

1439
01:54:31,095 --> 01:54:31,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1440
01:54:31,896 --> 01:54:40,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Nintendo has trademarked what is going to be about equally retarded as the Wii Vitality Sensor, Wii Relax.

1441
01:54:42,601 --> 01:54:45,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's a game about relaxing.

1442
01:54:46,663 --> 01:54:51,246
[SPEAKER_13]: It involves you putting on a vitality sensor so that you can relax.

1443
01:54:51,446 --> 01:54:52,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Relax or die!

1444
01:54:54,361 --> 01:54:55,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1445
01:55:18,737 --> 01:55:24,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that kind of counterintuitive, you know, with the whole Wii Fit?

1446
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I supposed to be moving?

1447
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:26,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know.

1448
01:55:28,241 --> 01:55:28,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no.

1449
01:55:30,542 --> 01:55:37,565
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the only thing I've ever known, like any type of exercise thing I've ever done where you have to keep perfectly still is doing isolation exercises.

1450
01:55:37,865 --> 01:55:39,906
[SPEAKER_10]: So other than that, I don't know.

1451
01:55:41,406 --> 01:55:42,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm grabbing at straws here.

1452
01:55:42,607 --> 01:55:43,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to.

1453
01:55:44,676 --> 01:55:45,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Find some logic in this.

1454
01:55:45,937 --> 01:55:46,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1455
01:55:46,918 --> 01:55:50,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully the game is going to say, you know, relax, but don't touch yourself.

1456
01:55:52,964 --> 01:55:53,564
[SPEAKER_07]: No wanking.

1457
01:55:54,345 --> 01:55:55,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait a second.

1458
01:55:55,346 --> 01:55:59,270
[SPEAKER_13]: The game is going to be like, please put it on your finger.

1459
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:00,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait a second.

1460
01:56:00,471 --> 01:56:01,532
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not your finger.

1461
01:56:02,953 --> 01:56:03,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop that.

1462
01:56:03,754 --> 01:56:04,575
[SPEAKER_13]: That is dirty.

1463
01:56:04,655 --> 01:56:05,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do not be fapping.

1464
01:56:09,946 --> 01:56:11,126
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1465
01:56:38,578 --> 01:56:40,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't get more relaxed than a corpse.

1466
01:56:41,399 --> 01:56:42,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just see it now.

1467
01:56:42,499 --> 01:56:45,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Person dies while playing We Relax and the game never knew.

1468
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,901
[SPEAKER_04]: High score.

1469
01:56:48,341 --> 01:56:50,362
[SPEAKER_04]: World record in We Relax.

1470
01:56:52,443 --> 01:56:54,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's terrible.

1471
01:56:54,483 --> 01:56:55,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, we should do that.

1472
01:56:55,804 --> 01:56:57,824
[SPEAKER_13]: We should try to go for the world record.

1473
01:56:58,184 --> 01:56:59,085
[SPEAKER_04]: In We Relax?

1474
01:56:59,665 --> 01:57:00,625
[SPEAKER_04]: No, then we'll die.

1475
01:57:00,705 --> 01:57:03,766
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way you're going to get the world record is to die while playing We Relax.

1476
01:57:05,267 --> 01:57:05,847
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth it.

1477
01:57:07,473 --> 01:57:07,553
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

1478
01:57:07,873 --> 01:57:08,614
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

1479
01:57:09,034 --> 01:57:09,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1480
01:57:09,534 --> 01:57:11,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the whole living thing, you know?

1481
01:57:11,956 --> 01:57:13,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this idea better.

1482
01:57:13,296 --> 01:57:15,537
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we go kill a million freaking zombies?

1483
01:57:16,558 --> 01:57:17,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be super awesome.

1484
01:57:17,859 --> 01:57:19,079
[SPEAKER_04]: That always makes a good game.

1485
01:57:19,139 --> 01:57:21,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence why Left 4 Dead is so freaking amazing.

1486
01:57:22,601 --> 01:57:31,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, what's going on here is that they're going to get characters from the original Left 4 Dead to now hang out with the...

1487
01:57:32,126 --> 01:57:33,007
[SPEAKER_04]: New characters.

1488
01:57:33,447 --> 01:57:42,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently the old characters and the new characters from Left 4 Dead 2 will meet in a game called The Passing, or a download content piece.

1489
01:57:43,033 --> 01:57:45,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called The Most Important Campaign in the Left 4 Dead Story.

1490
01:57:45,955 --> 01:57:48,857
[SPEAKER_04]: All the survivors are being called together in one campaign.

1491
01:57:49,157 --> 01:57:51,399
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from the Valve VP of Marketing, Doug Lombardi.

1492
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:54,701
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to come out in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PC.

1493
01:57:55,061 --> 01:57:57,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have a co-op campaign in rural Georgia and...

1494
01:57:58,163 --> 01:57:58,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1495
01:58:26,564 --> 01:58:28,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming to you right now is the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

1496
01:58:28,865 --> 01:58:32,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the part of the show every week where we take some emails and read them for you live on air.

1497
01:58:33,126 --> 01:58:33,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1498
01:58:34,547 --> 01:58:37,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, please open up the meal bag.

1499
01:58:37,868 --> 01:58:38,088
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1500
01:58:38,568 --> 01:58:39,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't talk tonight.

1501
01:58:40,729 --> 01:58:41,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm broken.

1502
01:58:41,649 --> 01:58:42,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to be fixed.

1503
01:58:43,669 --> 01:58:44,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in that way.

1504
01:58:44,490 --> 01:58:48,031
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to get us... I need to wee relax is what I need to do.

1505
01:58:48,111 --> 01:58:48,991
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to get us cupcakes.

1506
01:58:50,412 --> 01:58:51,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not need a goddamn cupcake.

1507
01:58:51,932 --> 01:58:53,973
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to get us cupcakes.

1508
01:58:55,472 --> 01:58:57,074
[SPEAKER_13]: How's that gonna help me?

1509
01:58:57,414 --> 01:59:00,577
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be doing a good deed, and it'll make you feel better in your heart.

1510
01:59:00,717 --> 01:59:03,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't We Relax thinking about baseball anyways?

1511
01:59:05,962 --> 01:59:09,005
[SPEAKER_10]: We Relax is mean... Think about it.

1512
01:59:09,265 --> 01:59:13,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Getting through with the... And it makes your Wii relax.

1513
01:59:15,731 --> 01:59:16,992
[SPEAKER_08]: They should do We Irritate.

1514
01:59:17,112 --> 01:59:17,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag!

1515
01:59:19,127 --> 01:59:24,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is sort of a mass email, so I'm going to go ahead and read it.

1516
01:59:24,828 --> 01:59:25,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question.

1517
01:59:25,728 --> 01:59:30,949
[SPEAKER_10]: If a kid has the money to get a console but no games, should the parent get the games for that console?

1518
01:59:30,989 --> 01:59:32,629
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, it is an Xbox 360.

1519
01:59:32,749 --> 01:59:34,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I can only survive on demos for so long.

1520
01:59:35,230 --> 01:59:36,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, DSMaster26.

1521
01:59:37,650 --> 01:59:37,950
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

1522
01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:41,171
[SPEAKER_10]: This is typed on a Wii with Wiimote, and I'm visually impaired, and lawsuits are disgraced.

1523
01:59:41,191 --> 01:59:41,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Shame on him.

1524
01:59:43,151 --> 01:59:43,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1525
01:59:43,831 --> 01:59:44,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1526
01:59:44,451 --> 01:59:47,212
[SPEAKER_01]: McDonald's is an equal opportunity employer.

1527
01:59:48,208 --> 01:59:50,971
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a job and save up and buy yourself some games.

1528
01:59:51,672 --> 01:59:53,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents don't have to buy you shit.

1529
01:59:54,534 --> 02:00:04,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents might reward you with games or consoles or what have you if you've been a good little boy and or girl and you do chores around the house and what have you.

1530
02:00:05,245 --> 02:00:11,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe you're in a household where you're fortunate enough to be spoiled to your heart's content like maybe Paris Hilton was when she was growing up.

1531
02:00:11,631 --> 02:00:14,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that's not the way most of us have it.

1532
02:00:14,393 --> 02:00:18,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, parents don't have to buy anything at all.

1533
02:00:19,377 --> 02:00:26,362
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, keep in mind, in this economy of people losing their jobs and stuff, some parents can't afford to buy games at all.

1534
02:00:26,462 --> 02:00:32,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you might be lucky to be getting a variety puzzle book from Penny Press.

1535
02:00:32,466 --> 02:00:33,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's your game.

1536
02:00:33,827 --> 02:00:38,190
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a Wii and an Xbox 360, you can sell one of them to get games for the other.

1537
02:00:40,032 --> 02:00:40,272
[SPEAKER_10]: You know...

1538
02:00:40,965 --> 02:00:47,667
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason I can get away with having all of these systems is because, well, until I hurt my hand, I had enough money to buy them.

1539
02:00:48,347 --> 02:00:54,389
[SPEAKER_04]: In certain states, if you're like 14, you can get a work permit and go work at certain places.

1540
02:00:54,429 --> 02:00:54,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1541
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:58,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bad idea because work experience goes a long way.

1542
02:00:58,731 --> 02:01:05,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you might not want to work, but if you want a really cushy job in the future, working the crap jobs now help get you there faster.

1543
02:01:07,113 --> 02:01:08,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just something to think about.

1544
02:01:09,508 --> 02:01:11,229
[SPEAKER_10]: MoLons unless you have lethal allergies.

1545
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:13,231
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find something.

1546
02:01:13,812 --> 02:01:26,562
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were skilled enough to type this email on a Wii or whatever, you probably can help old ladies and old men get their computers set up.

1547
02:01:27,363 --> 02:01:30,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet there's a lot of things that you probably can still do.

1548
02:01:30,986 --> 02:01:32,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you just have to look around for it.

1549
02:01:32,747 --> 02:01:36,750
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, it's not like you can't start a change jar.

1550
02:01:38,342 --> 02:01:43,224
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe your parents don't want you to get a job at 14, and that's their prerogative.

1551
02:01:43,524 --> 02:01:46,745
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents didn't want me to have a job that young because they wanted me to focus on studying.

1552
02:01:47,125 --> 02:01:50,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe try to work something out with your parents.

1553
02:01:50,946 --> 02:01:51,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get an allowance?

1554
02:01:52,007 --> 02:01:52,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I want this game.

1555
02:01:53,007 --> 02:01:54,187
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I get this game?

1556
02:01:54,227 --> 02:01:55,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get a job?

1557
02:01:55,528 --> 02:01:57,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I do chores around the house?

1558
02:01:57,748 --> 02:01:58,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get good grades?

1559
02:01:59,449 --> 02:02:01,430
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something I got the answer to.

1560
02:02:01,670 --> 02:02:05,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Your parents will raise you however they want and or can.

1561
02:02:07,151 --> 02:02:22,314
[SPEAKER_04]: or you know and certainly in other cases you know when I say parents I mean whoever is caring for you right now your guardians etc etc just because there's many different types of families out there I just want to point that out the last one is big long email

1562
02:02:23,114 --> 02:02:23,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, OLR Crew!

1563
02:02:23,995 --> 02:02:31,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I probably can't make it to tonight's episode due to finals and such, I thought I'd email my review of the game I'd like to share with everyone.

1564
02:02:32,138 --> 02:02:37,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Mushihime-sama Futari, a 2D bullet hell shooter from awesome folks at Cave.

1565
02:02:38,181 --> 02:02:43,943
[SPEAKER_10]: For those who haven't been caught up on the recent shmup news, the recent Xbox 360 port of Futari is region-free.

1566
02:02:44,483 --> 02:02:48,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Having heard this news, I pre-ordered my copy and received it within a week and a half of it shipping out.

1567
02:02:48,965 --> 02:02:50,365
[SPEAKER_10]: So far, the game is mind-blowing.

1568
02:02:50,825 --> 02:02:54,886
[SPEAKER_10]: After having played Touhou for a few months, Futari is especially pretty in comparison.

1569
02:02:55,446 --> 02:02:57,847
[SPEAKER_10]: The games are very nicely detailed and vivid.

1570
02:02:58,247 --> 02:03:02,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Although there is slowdown, it's implemented on purpose in order to make the game easier at times.

1571
02:03:03,108 --> 02:03:08,289
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as play options and modes go, Futari offers a wide variety of them.

1572
02:03:08,849 --> 02:03:15,451
[SPEAKER_10]: You can customize the game's display to your liking from the rotation of the screen for those dedicated enough to rotate their TVs for vertical shooters,

1573
02:03:15,871 --> 02:03:16,552
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

1574
02:03:34,891 --> 02:03:44,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there's Arrange Mode, a unique and complex twist on the regular gameplay, with the ability to switch characters as well as slow down bullets close to you and reflect them back to crank out tons of points.

1575
02:03:45,436 --> 02:03:53,019
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're looking for stress relief or bad at shooters, there's the Novice Mode, a glorified easy mode that offers the easy versions of Original, Maniac, and Ultra.

1576
02:03:53,499 --> 02:03:57,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried Novice, Ultra, and the bullet patterns are dense enough that you go, uh, wow.

1577
02:03:58,141 --> 02:03:58,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1578
02:04:19,156 --> 02:04:20,296
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1579
02:04:40,914 --> 02:04:47,056
[SPEAKER_10]: It offers revised, original, and maniac modes, as well as a new god mode that is like Ultra Mode, but with somewhat less retardedness.

1580
02:04:47,337 --> 02:04:47,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a word?

1581
02:04:48,477 --> 02:04:49,277
[SPEAKER_10]: And new shot types.

1582
02:04:49,477 --> 02:05:03,143
[SPEAKER_10]: While I like Black Label, I question whether it's worth the 1,200 Microsoft points, especially since I can get Raiden Fighters Aces 3 games in one for $5 more, or one of a handful of standalone shmups for anywhere between $5 and $10.

1583
02:05:04,663 --> 02:05:11,189
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a dedicated Bullet Hell fan or have an Xbox 360 of any region lying around, you owe it to yourself to snap up a copy of Futari for $3.60.

1584
02:05:11,489 --> 02:05:12,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, hey, $70?

1585
02:05:13,550 --> 02:05:15,992
[SPEAKER_10]: At least you're not paying triple digits for the arcade hardware.

1586
02:05:16,353 --> 02:05:18,594
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's from Ray Iannami, slash GS68.

1587
02:05:18,675 --> 02:05:18,995
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

1588
02:05:19,055 --> 02:05:22,818
[SPEAKER_10]: This email is brought to you by San Jose State University, home of the never-ending furlough days.

1589
02:05:23,464 --> 02:05:24,805
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on the list of things to play.

1590
02:05:25,385 --> 02:05:33,850
[SPEAKER_13]: The next one on my list other than Bayonetta for my Japanese region system was Oto Media's Gorgeous was the next one I wanted to play.

1591
02:05:33,950 --> 02:05:36,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Then of course the one he mentioned was...

1592
02:05:38,052 --> 02:05:38,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan's Monitor Rotates

1593
02:05:58,388 --> 02:06:03,050
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, he's actually pulled out the monitor and rotated it to play, um, shmups.

1594
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:07,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think he got, like, uh, Raiden and Raiden 2 to run on MAME.

1595
02:06:08,852 --> 02:06:10,873
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, he's, it works.

1596
02:06:12,494 --> 02:06:12,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1597
02:06:14,195 --> 02:06:15,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, thank you for the review.

1598
02:06:15,395 --> 02:06:16,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

1599
02:06:16,095 --> 02:06:18,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, you can always send in your own game review if you want to.

1600
02:06:18,536 --> 02:06:21,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send emails.

1601
02:06:21,157 --> 02:06:22,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that it for emails tonight?

1602
02:06:22,734 --> 02:06:23,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It was indeed.

1603
02:06:23,354 --> 02:06:24,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then there you go.

1604
02:06:24,415 --> 02:06:26,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's move on to some more stories.

1605
02:06:26,095 --> 02:06:31,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1606
02:06:31,378 --> 02:06:32,338
[SPEAKER_04]: But not just yet.

1607
02:06:32,638 --> 02:06:34,719
[SPEAKER_04]: For now, let's do some last few stories here.

1608
02:06:36,039 --> 02:06:40,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, before we do stories, though... Oh, gosh, that's right.

1609
02:06:40,161 --> 02:06:41,202
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to get to the angst.

1610
02:06:41,222 --> 02:06:43,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not now, because DarkSakura just ran to use the potty.

1611
02:06:43,482 --> 02:06:44,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll do the stories in the angst.

1612
02:06:44,523 --> 02:06:46,204
[SPEAKER_13]: She went through a different type of angst.

1613
02:06:46,244 --> 02:06:46,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1614
02:06:49,282 --> 02:06:53,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, there's a rumor that NHL 2K11 may be cancelled.

1615
02:06:54,830 --> 02:06:58,174
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe 2K Sports is in some sort of financial trouble.

1616
02:06:59,336 --> 02:07:02,700
[SPEAKER_13]: This is coming from the recently released...

1617
02:07:04,851 --> 02:07:07,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Take-Two's Q4 Fiscal 2009 results.

1618
02:07:08,433 --> 02:07:12,935
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a section of games that the publisher is currently planning to ship in 2010.

1619
02:07:13,616 --> 02:07:21,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Both MLB 2K10 and NBA 2K11 are listed on the report, although I would think it's... I can't remember if it's 2K9.

1620
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:22,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I guess that's right there.

1621
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:23,781
[SPEAKER_13]: You're behind or whatever.

1622
02:07:24,441 --> 02:07:24,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

1623
02:07:26,322 --> 02:07:30,384
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, that NHL 2K11 is not on the list.

1624
02:07:33,146 --> 02:07:33,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

1625
02:07:33,567 --> 02:07:42,656
[SPEAKER_13]: And it says, we are currently in the process of evaluating our sports portfolio and have not announced any new NHL titles at this time.

1626
02:07:43,597 --> 02:07:47,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, that's a pretty damning statement they put it.

1627
02:07:48,222 --> 02:07:48,362
[SPEAKER_13]: And

1628
02:07:49,733 --> 02:08:00,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Also saying that if NHL 2K is no more, the franchise appears to be dying the same death as, I guess, College Hoops 2K series.

1629
02:08:00,067 --> 02:08:05,314
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're kind of slimlining, I guess, their portfolio as far as

1630
02:08:07,039 --> 02:08:18,106
[SPEAKER_13]: And honestly, I'm kind of surprised with the NHL stuff, because I always thought the NHL 2K did a lot better than the EA's NHL games.

1631
02:08:18,747 --> 02:08:22,189
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was a better put-together game.

1632
02:08:22,209 --> 02:08:31,194
[SPEAKER_13]: At least my friend at work, who's really huge in the hockey, used to pick up the 2K series quite often, and he seemed to like it a lot better.

1633
02:08:31,274 --> 02:08:32,875
[SPEAKER_13]: But, eh, who knows.

1634
02:08:33,816 --> 02:08:33,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1635
02:08:35,168 --> 02:08:46,603
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, they're wondering that maybe 2K Sports as a publisher might be in some trouble as well, seeing as MLB 2K apparently didn't

1636
02:08:47,867 --> 02:08:49,568
[SPEAKER_13]: All American Football 2K or whatever that sucked.

1637
02:09:16,516 --> 02:09:17,036
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1638
02:09:41,332 --> 02:09:42,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1639
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:03,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Make your way to Champions Online right now

1640
02:10:24,052 --> 02:10:28,194
[SPEAKER_13]: What is Warcraft doing for their holiday event?

1641
02:10:28,434 --> 02:10:32,036
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of do the same thing they do usually during the holiday events.

1642
02:10:32,876 --> 02:10:36,158
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it the festival something.

1643
02:10:36,178 --> 02:10:36,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1644
02:10:37,478 --> 02:10:41,180
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to give everything very generic holiday names because they're not taken from the real world.

1645
02:10:41,540 --> 02:11:00,306
[SPEAKER_04]: but they do holiday events pretty much the same every year but sometimes they add new things like a new boss or this year they added Thanksgiving event was brand new so you know they kind of go back to the calendar and add new things but they do holidays throughout the year all right anyhow um let's get to the FUs of the week because I missed doing it earlier and um but I just wanted to talk about teddy bears

1646
02:11:16,764 --> 02:11:19,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, I've had a really great weekend.

1647
02:11:20,809 --> 02:11:23,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, I can't really say F you to anything.

1648
02:11:24,674 --> 02:11:27,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Except maybe, um, situations regarding a late paycheck.

1649
02:11:28,739 --> 02:11:29,020
[SPEAKER_10]: And EBD.

1650
02:11:30,293 --> 02:11:36,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard that California, like, I don't know about disability, but unemployment especially had some hurdles recently, too.

1651
02:11:36,657 --> 02:11:37,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that affects it all ends of it.

1652
02:11:37,898 --> 02:11:44,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm actually more pissed off at EDD for not sending me certain paperwork that I needed to fill out three weeks ago.

1653
02:11:45,623 --> 02:11:48,545
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm still waiting on three weeks of pay.

1654
02:11:48,825 --> 02:11:49,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Lame.

1655
02:11:49,465 --> 02:11:53,508
[SPEAKER_10]: But starting next week, though, I'm back to getting some of my regular checks.

1656
02:11:54,068 --> 02:11:54,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki!

1657
02:11:56,554 --> 02:12:07,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, a few people that think it's necessary to put inflatable holiday, I don't even know what you'd call them, decorations out on their lawn and or house.

1658
02:12:08,462 --> 02:12:10,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently it is just really prevalent this year.

1659
02:12:11,348 --> 02:12:12,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they're all over the fucking place.

1660
02:12:12,829 --> 02:12:17,272
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, our neighbor's house across the street decided, hey, you know what would be a great idea?

1661
02:12:17,292 --> 02:12:20,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's put Frosty the Snowman on our roof with some presents.

1662
02:12:20,654 --> 02:12:23,796
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like a giant fucking snowman is attacking the house.

1663
02:12:24,236 --> 02:12:26,457
[SPEAKER_13]: It is just retarded.

1664
02:12:26,737 --> 02:12:29,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And people need to... Maybe that's the next Champions Online boss.

1665
02:12:29,499 --> 02:12:29,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1666
02:12:29,879 --> 02:12:30,980
[SPEAKER_13]: They need to cut it back.

1667
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:40,306
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because they've got all sorts of playable things from, you know, giant snow globes to there's a guy in the corner that has Santa riding a Harley.

1668
02:12:40,987 --> 02:12:56,427
[SPEAKER_13]: it's ridiculous and I mean it's just another thing that the holiday can barf onto your house because there's some people that have everything and they just keep adding every year and oh my god one house looks like they threw the lights just over the house and that's it it's sad

1669
02:12:57,376 --> 02:12:59,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I like DarkSakura.

1670
02:12:59,618 --> 02:13:02,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are pretty good for me right now, so I don't have a lot of angst, actually.

1671
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:06,742
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say, F you to mob mentality, especially on the internets.

1672
02:13:07,483 --> 02:13:08,984
[SPEAKER_04]: God, some people are real sheep.

1673
02:13:10,424 --> 02:13:13,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly I'm not talking about any of you, of course, folks listening, what have you.

1674
02:13:13,546 --> 02:13:17,009
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just things I observe as I lurk on the internets.

1675
02:13:18,430 --> 02:13:21,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I do also, though, think there should be an F you directed to that site, too.

1676
02:13:23,269 --> 02:13:24,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, of course.

1677
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:26,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that goes... God, they got 20 minutes of an FU earlier.

1678
02:13:26,771 --> 02:13:28,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to give them any more time.

1679
02:13:28,632 --> 02:13:28,972
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1680
02:13:29,372 --> 02:13:30,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, how could we forget?

1681
02:13:30,993 --> 02:13:31,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiara's here.

1682
02:13:31,733 --> 02:13:33,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe she wants to get in on the angst tonight.

1683
02:13:35,055 --> 02:13:38,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to say FU to people who deny the Holocaust.

1684
02:13:39,977 --> 02:13:41,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how can you do that?

1685
02:13:42,498 --> 02:13:43,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1686
02:13:43,379 --> 02:13:45,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm laughing because it's ridiculous.

1687
02:13:46,148 --> 02:14:00,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a teacher, a PE teacher in Las Vegas was suspended for telling students that the Holocaust didn't exist and that photographs were doctored, textbooks are inaccurate, and that the Nazis lacked the technology to kill so many people.

1688
02:14:00,644 --> 02:14:02,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I hope they fire her.

1689
02:14:02,867 --> 02:14:03,588
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to that lady.

1690
02:14:05,367 --> 02:14:05,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1691
02:14:06,628 --> 02:14:06,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1692
02:14:07,108 --> 02:14:08,189
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I can say is wow.

1693
02:14:09,951 --> 02:14:10,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1694
02:14:10,351 --> 02:14:18,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of put, well, that's really bad, but the whole 9-11 conspiracy theories, like, come on.

1695
02:14:19,198 --> 02:14:19,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1696
02:14:20,439 --> 02:14:26,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, first of all, in both situations, you've got first-person accounts from people who were there.

1697
02:14:27,224 --> 02:14:29,686
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's ridiculous.

1698
02:14:29,706 --> 02:14:29,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Ridiculous.

1699
02:14:30,410 --> 02:14:31,851
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1700
02:14:54,466 --> 02:14:57,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing very well, and sounds like you guys are doing well too.

1701
02:14:57,511 --> 02:14:58,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent, yes, actually we're doing pretty good.

1702
02:14:59,213 --> 02:15:02,839
[SPEAKER_04]: When two of the three hosts have very little to rant about, it's usually a good night.

1703
02:15:03,620 --> 02:15:04,721
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's on your mind?

1704
02:15:05,082 --> 02:15:06,504
[SPEAKER_04]: To what do we owe this phone call tonight?

1705
02:15:07,606 --> 02:15:07,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Well...

1706
02:15:08,835 --> 02:15:14,677
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, as many people have been following, Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix is coming out this week.

1707
02:15:14,937 --> 02:15:25,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we talked about it at the top of the show, of course, but for those that tuned in late, it's like a fan project dedicated to the show, which Loki, myself, and DarkSakura, we didn't do shit for this project.

1708
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:26,000
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't do anything.

1709
02:15:27,261 --> 02:15:28,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not directly.

1710
02:15:28,201 --> 02:15:33,683
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys created the shenanigans that is the show, and we kind of went with it.

1711
02:15:34,203 --> 02:15:34,683
[SPEAKER_00]: So we...

1712
02:15:36,712 --> 02:15:38,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I'm the lead developer, but you know what?

1713
02:15:38,816 --> 02:15:41,260
[SPEAKER_00]: This has all been a group effort.

1714
02:15:41,641 --> 02:15:44,767
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of listeners have contributed.

1715
02:15:45,448 --> 02:15:48,975
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us two years, but I think we made a very great game.

1716
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:51,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, tell us about some of the thank yous.

1717
02:15:52,002 --> 02:15:55,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are some of the people we need to give hugs and kisses to for making this game happen besides you?

1718
02:15:59,508 --> 02:16:04,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, the hardcore listeners like, you know, we have Actdeft who worked on a couple songs.

1719
02:16:04,853 --> 02:16:12,219
[SPEAKER_00]: We have DarkTetsuya, Misty, Breslul, who gave us the amazing announcer pack.

1720
02:16:13,420 --> 02:16:13,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

1721
02:16:14,884 --> 02:16:16,626
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of other people I can't even think of.

1722
02:16:16,686 --> 02:16:19,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you really have to put that guy song in there though?

1723
02:16:19,309 --> 02:16:23,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I saw that YouTube and I was like, what is this?

1724
02:16:25,285 --> 02:16:26,166
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1725
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:56,171
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside joke is, it's just John.

1726
02:16:56,532 --> 02:16:57,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, okay, fair enough.

1727
02:16:58,353 --> 02:17:04,118
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we have a lot of things in there from, you know, back from your old days from USL.

1728
02:17:05,199 --> 02:17:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1729
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:06,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.

1730
02:17:06,640 --> 02:17:08,041
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to talk about embarrassing stuff?

1731
02:17:08,221 --> 02:17:14,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather the Like a Prayer stuff be released on, like, Entertainment Tonight than some of the old USL clips.

1732
02:17:15,387 --> 02:17:18,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, we pretty much have everything that you've sung on there.

1733
02:17:18,930 --> 02:17:19,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1734
02:17:21,052 --> 02:17:23,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Contributed by a certain Mr. Donovan.

1735
02:17:23,784 --> 02:17:24,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.

1736
02:17:25,024 --> 02:17:26,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.

1737
02:17:26,325 --> 02:17:34,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, be glad we didn't know you back then because Travis had a way of getting you to make an ass out of yourself on the radio.

1738
02:17:34,447 --> 02:17:35,687
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless Travis Donovan.

1739
02:17:35,707 --> 02:17:38,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I would probably not be doing internet radio right now still if it were not for him.

1740
02:17:38,788 --> 02:17:42,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I still remember the number one way to make him upset was to drop the C-bomb.

1741
02:17:43,169 --> 02:17:43,909
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1742
02:17:44,029 --> 02:17:45,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And you kept doing it.

1743
02:17:46,590 --> 02:17:48,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was my favorite word at the time.

1744
02:17:49,291 --> 02:17:49,751
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow.

1745
02:17:50,421 --> 02:17:55,622
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, Loki didn't get unscathed on this, so both of his performances are in the game.

1746
02:17:55,962 --> 02:17:56,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God.

1747
02:17:56,803 --> 02:17:59,523
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why I don't do karaoke on the internet.

1748
02:17:59,543 --> 02:18:02,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you able to find anything embarrassing of DarkSakura?

1749
02:18:03,444 --> 02:18:05,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, we haven't been able to.

1750
02:18:05,445 --> 02:18:08,466
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our archivers, but no one was able to find anything.

1751
02:18:08,686 --> 02:18:11,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask Travis for the apology song.

1752
02:18:11,407 --> 02:18:11,807
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

1753
02:18:13,567 --> 02:18:14,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

1754
02:18:14,867 --> 02:18:16,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that would piss me off.

1755
02:18:18,819 --> 02:18:20,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Beyond, piss her off with laughter.

1756
02:18:23,001 --> 02:18:26,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why we have to get the bad stuff.

1757
02:18:26,804 --> 02:18:29,185
[SPEAKER_10]: That's actually something that I'm still upset with him about.

1758
02:18:30,346 --> 02:18:31,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Then don't ask him about that.

1759
02:18:32,308 --> 02:18:35,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask him to hear it, just don't put it in the game.

1760
02:18:37,071 --> 02:18:43,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things that we put in, we kind of made themed non-stop tracks of songs that are

1761
02:18:44,272 --> 02:18:45,773
[SPEAKER_00]: That you guys would enjoy.

1762
02:18:45,813 --> 02:18:48,255
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have a lot of songs from the Cage match.

1763
02:18:48,275 --> 02:18:54,679
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of songs that, you know, you, Jamie, and Matt like.

1764
02:18:54,719 --> 02:18:58,081
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's got pretty much everything in it.

1765
02:18:58,121 --> 02:19:01,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Just an all ABBA course for me, of course.

1766
02:19:01,983 --> 02:19:04,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we don't have a whole lot of ABBA in it.

1767
02:19:04,525 --> 02:19:06,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, fine.

1768
02:19:06,746 --> 02:19:07,347
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Skulk.

1769
02:19:07,367 --> 02:19:08,428
[SPEAKER_00]: We know you like that.

1770
02:19:08,568 --> 02:19:09,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

1771
02:19:09,228 --> 02:19:09,828
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite.

1772
02:19:09,848 --> 02:19:11,369
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Castlevania stuff for Jamie.

1773
02:19:11,389 --> 02:19:11,710
[SPEAKER_00]: We have...

1774
02:19:14,226 --> 02:19:18,508
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of Loki's remixes in there, so it's really got everything in it.

1775
02:19:18,608 --> 02:19:19,149
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?

1776
02:19:19,229 --> 02:19:20,529
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just end here.

1777
02:19:20,589 --> 02:19:24,031
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually are planning on doing DLC for it.

1778
02:19:24,532 --> 02:19:26,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, DLC.

1779
02:19:26,273 --> 02:19:26,653
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

1780
02:19:26,893 --> 02:19:32,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this is all free because it's kind of a ripoff of DDR in the first place, so you can't really charge for it.

1781
02:19:32,796 --> 02:19:35,878
[SPEAKER_04]: But if the listeners want to grab it, how can they get a copy of the game?

1782
02:19:36,769 --> 02:19:42,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the game comes out on Christmas Eve, so this will be a nice Christmas present for all the All Our fans.

1783
02:19:42,371 --> 02:19:49,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be up on the website, in the forums, so you'll be able to download it, spread it out, give it to everyone to your heart's content.

1784
02:19:50,287 --> 02:19:50,667
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1785
02:19:50,787 --> 02:19:52,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Spread it like a badass TD.

1786
02:19:52,328 --> 02:19:55,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go out there and tell all your friends.

1787
02:19:56,149 --> 02:20:08,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I truly think it's awesome that you guys have spent so much time on what some might view as a silly little project, but I kind of go, wow, the show actually people wanted to do that for our show?

1788
02:20:08,392 --> 02:20:13,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't describe for you how neat that feels.

1789
02:20:13,193 --> 02:20:15,234
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't have been able to do it without you guys.

1790
02:20:15,534 --> 02:20:16,694
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys didn't do the show, then...

1791
02:20:18,073 --> 02:20:20,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Nerds Hovering Around a Keyboard

1792
02:20:48,172 --> 02:20:48,453
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1793
02:20:48,933 --> 02:20:54,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, SSJ100 Matt, is there anything else you want to say about the project or anything else going on in your week that you want to tell us about?

1794
02:20:56,296 --> 02:20:56,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing really.

1795
02:20:56,836 --> 02:21:04,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've just been playing the new crack game that I have is Modern Warfare 2 and, you know, plenty of NHL.

1796
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:09,622
[SPEAKER_00]: But aside from that, you know, working on this game so everyone can get it out on Christmas.

1797
02:21:10,202 --> 02:21:11,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So aside from that.

1798
02:21:12,685 --> 02:21:13,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there Iraqi suicide babies?

1799
02:21:38,004 --> 02:21:38,985
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an old joke.

1800
02:21:39,065 --> 02:21:39,625
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

1801
02:21:39,805 --> 02:21:40,806
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say.

1802
02:21:41,966 --> 02:21:43,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be the toasty thing that comes out.

1803
02:21:43,527 --> 02:21:43,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1804
02:21:44,247 --> 02:21:47,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what other really, really old jokes do we have on the show?

1805
02:21:48,049 --> 02:21:49,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to go way back.

1806
02:21:50,430 --> 02:21:51,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Black Cock.

1807
02:21:51,251 --> 02:21:51,791
[SPEAKER_04]: That's old.

1808
02:21:51,831 --> 02:21:54,212
[SPEAKER_10]: The King of Iron Fingering.

1809
02:21:54,392 --> 02:21:55,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a good embarrassing Jamie moment.

1810
02:21:56,253 --> 02:21:58,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but that was old and I don't care anymore.

1811
02:21:58,855 --> 02:22:02,577
[SPEAKER_04]: She's over it now.

1812
02:22:02,917 --> 02:22:05,318
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, definitely check out fans if

1813
02:22:06,445 --> 02:22:10,771
[SPEAKER_00]: In the chat room and everyone, check out the Orange Lines Revolution YouTube channel.

1814
02:22:11,773 --> 02:22:15,919
[SPEAKER_00]: We're posting up previews of everything and eventually we'll post up everything that's on there.

1815
02:22:17,336 --> 02:22:17,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out now.

1816
02:22:44,404 --> 02:22:47,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, they actually had the video of the Like a Prayer thing there?

1817
02:22:48,346 --> 02:22:48,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

1818
02:22:50,607 --> 02:22:51,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was it?

1819
02:22:51,068 --> 02:22:51,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, here it is.

1820
02:22:52,808 --> 02:22:55,050
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the great classics you can play in this game.

1821
02:22:57,671 --> 02:22:58,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for it to buff.

1822
02:23:06,315 --> 02:23:08,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like The Legend of Max, right, basically?

1823
02:23:08,536 --> 02:23:09,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, wait.

1824
02:23:19,244 --> 02:23:22,307
[SPEAKER_04]: or this one, Guyonora Waternal.

1825
02:23:26,231 --> 02:23:26,952
[SPEAKER_04]: If it'll load.

1826
02:23:27,132 --> 02:23:27,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1827
02:23:30,075 --> 02:23:32,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

1828
02:23:32,698 --> 02:23:32,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy.

1829
02:23:33,839 --> 02:23:33,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy.

1830
02:23:34,020 --> 02:23:34,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy.

1831
02:23:47,836 --> 02:23:50,686
[SPEAKER_04]: See, to someone who listens to Under Station Live, that's funny.

1832
02:23:50,746 --> 02:23:53,837
[SPEAKER_04]: To the rest of us, we're like, what is that?

1833
02:23:55,679 --> 02:23:57,360
[SPEAKER_00]: But you all know John, so you know.

1834
02:23:58,100 --> 02:23:58,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1835
02:23:58,881 --> 02:24:00,782
[SPEAKER_04]: John needs to come back and visit.

1836
02:24:01,142 --> 02:24:08,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I have heard rumors, I have heard rumblings, that the one and only Travis Donovan is considering a Sacramento visit.

1837
02:24:08,707 --> 02:24:12,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have Travis Donovan on this very program.

1838
02:24:13,911 --> 02:24:17,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could have sworn at one point he swore he would never come on Orange Floss Radio.

1839
02:24:18,434 --> 02:24:19,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But that might have changed.

1840
02:24:19,675 --> 02:24:23,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It's eight years now, and we may have him on the program.

1841
02:24:23,357 --> 02:24:23,897
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be...

1842
02:24:25,018 --> 02:24:25,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even explain.

1843
02:24:25,779 --> 02:24:27,340
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be like DC and Marvel.

1844
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:31,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, set your TiVos now, kids.

1845
02:24:31,683 --> 02:24:32,743
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be an amazing show.

1846
02:24:35,145 --> 02:24:35,385
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1847
02:24:36,086 --> 02:24:39,548
[SPEAKER_04]: SJ100, Matt, thank you so much for the call, and thank you again for all your hard work in this project.

1848
02:24:39,588 --> 02:24:40,309
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of fun.

1849
02:24:40,349 --> 02:24:40,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.

1850
02:24:41,189 --> 02:24:41,489
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1851
02:24:41,569 --> 02:24:41,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1852
02:24:42,610 --> 02:24:43,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, take care.

1853
02:24:44,171 --> 02:24:44,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love that call.

1854
02:24:44,992 --> 02:24:45,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1855
02:24:45,772 --> 02:24:46,613
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you.

1856
02:24:46,713 --> 02:24:47,093
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1857
02:24:47,253 --> 02:24:47,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1858
02:24:47,894 --> 02:24:48,634
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

1859
02:24:49,035 --> 02:24:49,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1860
02:24:50,301 --> 02:25:13,370
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want to give us a call and say your thanks or let us thank you for calling 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call again that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so you can go ahead and give us a call right now we're taking calls live while we wait for some calls since there is a little bit of a buffer between when we say things here in studio and when you guys hear them on the feed let's get some last minute stories Loki

1861
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:19,752
[SPEAKER_13]: The Sims 3 is releasing a tool to create your own worlds, so you can build your own towns in those said worlds.

1862
02:25:20,432 --> 02:25:24,813
[SPEAKER_13]: And that'll be released soon, although I don't see when.

1863
02:25:25,353 --> 02:25:25,693
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1864
02:25:26,613 --> 02:25:27,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Russell, Russell, Thumble, Thumble.

1865
02:25:27,994 --> 02:25:28,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, caller, are you there?

1866
02:25:28,874 --> 02:25:29,794
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1867
02:25:29,814 --> 02:25:30,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1868
02:25:30,814 --> 02:25:31,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, who is this?

1869
02:25:31,414 --> 02:25:33,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Deathwishing.

1870
02:25:33,415 --> 02:25:34,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Deathwishing.

1871
02:25:34,275 --> 02:25:34,875
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

1872
02:25:36,416 --> 02:25:38,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first off, can I say an F you?

1873
02:25:38,476 --> 02:25:41,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I kind of feel like I probably should have said this instead of what I said.

1874
02:25:41,477 --> 02:25:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1875
02:25:41,737 --> 02:25:41,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1876
02:25:42,728 --> 02:25:45,889
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the Modern Warfare 2 hackers, you've ruined it for me.

1877
02:25:46,209 --> 02:25:46,770
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they do?

1878
02:25:49,451 --> 02:25:56,553
[SPEAKER_02]: The spin lately, I don't know if the patch has addressed it yet, but they've actually made it where certain playlists and stuff will put you into hacked games and stuff.

1879
02:25:56,673 --> 02:26:01,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the third-person playlists on it, and I'm now getting put into 18-player free-for-all.

1880
02:26:04,895 --> 02:26:12,465
[SPEAKER_02]: with unlimited noob tube people like unlimited ammo with noob tubes and then when someone gets an AC-130 it's just rapid fire.

1881
02:26:16,371 --> 02:26:19,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I support hacking and cracking your own game.

1882
02:26:19,631 --> 02:26:30,773
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to go hack Modern Warfare so that you jump to the sun whenever you jump or that you have infinite rockets or whatever, go for it.

1883
02:26:31,013 --> 02:26:37,355
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you go and force that on other people in multiplayer to inflate your EP to make you feel better, that's just messed up.

1884
02:26:37,375 --> 02:26:38,675
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what the rest of us are paying for.

1885
02:26:39,724 --> 02:26:40,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stinks.

1886
02:26:41,365 --> 02:26:42,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Hack it to your heart's content.

1887
02:26:42,405 --> 02:26:43,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't go online with it.

1888
02:26:44,566 --> 02:26:46,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also got a PS3.

1889
02:26:46,607 --> 02:26:47,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, congratulations.

1890
02:26:47,607 --> 02:26:48,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get any games for it?

1891
02:26:49,628 --> 02:26:50,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

1892
02:26:50,349 --> 02:26:50,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

1893
02:26:50,729 --> 02:26:51,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you thinking?

1894
02:26:51,369 --> 02:26:52,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you sent us a tweet earlier.

1895
02:26:52,750 --> 02:26:55,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I rented Killzone 2.

1896
02:26:56,351 --> 02:26:56,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And how was that?

1897
02:26:57,912 --> 02:26:58,472
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.

1898
02:26:59,373 --> 02:27:05,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you thought about... Now, you were asking us about a lot of retail games, but have you thought about any of the download stuff that PlayStation Network offers?

1899
02:27:06,016 --> 02:27:08,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Bat Princess was the first thing that came to mind.

1900
02:27:08,357 --> 02:27:08,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1901
02:27:08,757 --> 02:27:09,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get it?

1902
02:27:10,057 --> 02:27:10,297
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1903
02:27:10,577 --> 02:27:12,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the money.

1904
02:27:12,918 --> 02:27:13,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see then.

1905
02:27:13,678 --> 02:27:17,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe for Christmas you'll get some money or some PSN cards and you can talk about it in a future show.

1906
02:27:18,639 --> 02:27:22,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I found out an old thing you guys didn't think about, an old joke.

1907
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:23,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1908
02:27:23,380 --> 02:27:24,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck exclamation points.

1909
02:27:27,461 --> 02:27:27,681
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1910
02:27:28,542 --> 02:27:29,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you exclamation points?

1911
02:27:29,602 --> 02:27:30,282
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't remember that?

1912
02:27:31,042 --> 02:27:32,603
[SPEAKER_04]: The exclamation points?

1913
02:27:33,343 --> 02:27:33,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1914
02:27:34,903 --> 02:27:35,683
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to explain.

1915
02:27:35,763 --> 02:27:35,943
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1916
02:27:37,184 --> 02:27:38,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's hard to explain.

1917
02:27:39,983 --> 02:27:44,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind Hold on, where's our Price is Right losing horn?

1918
02:27:44,346 --> 02:27:53,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I just died a little bit You don't even want to try and explain what this is?

1919
02:27:53,613 --> 02:28:03,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously you thought it was funny I don't really want to explain because I've been up for 32 hours What have you been up for 32 hours for?

1920
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:04,541
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my party

1921
02:28:05,253 --> 02:28:08,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's your party and you'll make a fail call to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to.

1922
02:28:08,755 --> 02:28:10,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So congratulations.

1923
02:28:11,016 --> 02:28:12,177
[SPEAKER_04]: This fail horn is for you.

1924
02:28:13,437 --> 02:28:16,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to kill myself.

1925
02:28:16,959 --> 02:28:17,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to kill myself.

1926
02:28:19,461 --> 02:28:20,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't kill yourself.

1927
02:28:20,341 --> 02:28:21,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to bed.

1928
02:28:21,562 --> 02:28:25,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Allison, the best thing, it's a 4chan meme.

1929
02:28:26,624 --> 02:28:27,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1930
02:28:28,085 --> 02:28:30,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I really just let that onto this program?

1931
02:28:30,306 --> 02:28:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I suppose it was inevitable at some point.

1932
02:28:31,967 --> 02:28:32,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, whatever.

1933
02:28:33,128 --> 02:28:33,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1934
02:28:36,297 --> 02:28:41,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Where there is a dark corner of the internet to be hiding in, there lies 4chan.

1935
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:42,340
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you know?

1936
02:28:42,761 --> 02:28:44,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hide there because I fail.

1937
02:28:45,762 --> 02:28:47,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well congratulations on failing.

1938
02:28:47,743 --> 02:28:49,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, have a good night, death wishing, and happy birthday.

1939
02:28:50,725 --> 02:28:52,426
[SPEAKER_04]: They want your cupcakes, by the way.

1940
02:28:53,466 --> 02:28:54,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I have 15 of them.

1941
02:28:54,987 --> 02:28:55,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, later.

1942
02:28:56,128 --> 02:29:01,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1943
02:29:01,431 --> 02:29:02,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Try not to have a fail call.

1944
02:29:03,472 --> 02:29:04,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1945
02:29:07,408 --> 02:29:08,869
[SPEAKER_03]: No, okay, I'm done with that.

1946
02:29:08,929 --> 02:29:10,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that really come from 4chan?

1947
02:29:12,231 --> 02:29:17,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that whole thing, this is completely unrelated to why I'm calling, but this is Breslow, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.

1948
02:29:17,813 --> 02:29:18,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi, Breslow, sorry.

1949
02:29:19,334 --> 02:29:23,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume the listeners know that from the screechy voice we heard in guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy.

1950
02:29:24,557 --> 02:29:24,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

1951
02:29:25,617 --> 02:29:26,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate everybody.

1952
02:29:27,378 --> 02:29:31,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I was red in the face when you were playing that, so now everybody thinks of me as this monster.

1953
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:35,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good, now you know how I feel when I saw the like a prayer thing on YouTube.

1954
02:29:36,669 --> 02:29:38,130
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you want?

1955
02:29:38,351 --> 02:29:38,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1956
02:29:38,531 --> 02:29:38,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Because...

1957
02:30:05,230 --> 02:30:08,632
[SPEAKER_03]: We started a tradition two years ago on this very station.

1958
02:30:11,273 --> 02:30:14,835
[SPEAKER_03]: We called it March Madness, but now since we started in January, we just call it Madness.

1959
02:30:15,855 --> 02:30:21,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Best 80 games of all time square off in battle and only one survives.

1960
02:30:21,178 --> 02:30:22,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year it was Super Mario Bros.

1961
02:30:23,038 --> 02:30:28,161
[SPEAKER_03]: 3 and I'm officially opening the boat for nominations.

1962
02:30:28,990 --> 02:30:32,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, so nominations are kicking off tonight, even though it's not 2010 yet.

1963
02:30:32,359 --> 02:30:35,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you kicking off things a little early, DMN?

1964
02:30:36,424 --> 02:30:43,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yes, because I have so much, I'm going to have so much stress in January, I want to get it started now.

1965
02:30:44,148 --> 02:30:47,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's your shtick, you can do whatever the hell you want, DMN, you go.

1966
02:30:47,590 --> 02:31:00,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but we're changing the voting around, so there could be, like, games like Rockman and DDR, now, I know a lot of people who listen to the show are huge Bimani fans, and that's nothing against them, but

1967
02:31:00,976 --> 02:31:07,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a problem when DDR is seated in the top 12 and Rock Band has seated in the top 5 for consecutive years.

1968
02:31:08,084 --> 02:31:20,258
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're changing the formula a little bit to keep it a little bit more fair so we don't see games like Rock Band get all the way to the final four because a lot of people are like, this game doesn't really need to be here.

1969
02:31:22,625 --> 02:31:24,227
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing different?

1970
02:31:24,287 --> 02:31:26,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it a top secret formula?

1971
02:31:27,069 --> 02:31:27,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a secret.

1972
02:31:27,810 --> 02:31:28,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

1973
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:29,891
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the herbs and spices at KFC.

1974
02:31:29,951 --> 02:31:31,753
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to forever remain top secret.

1975
02:31:32,133 --> 02:31:33,034
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a secret to everybody.

1976
02:31:33,054 --> 02:31:36,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So go vote on something that you're not really sure how it works.

1977
02:31:36,577 --> 02:31:39,439
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the end, there will be a winner that will be picked.

1978
02:31:39,620 --> 02:31:40,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And Pi?

1979
02:31:41,261 --> 02:31:45,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I have all the details of submitting your vote on OrangeLinesRadio.com right now.

1980
02:31:45,364 --> 02:31:45,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

1981
02:31:46,345 --> 02:31:50,669
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are any questions, they can also be directed to uslmadness at gmail.com.

1982
02:31:51,873 --> 02:31:55,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be putting bracket details up probably in a couple of weeks.

1983
02:31:55,694 --> 02:32:00,656
[SPEAKER_03]: But votes are open now, so vote early, but don't vote often because you can only vote once.

1984
02:32:01,376 --> 02:32:01,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.

1985
02:32:02,576 --> 02:32:02,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1986
02:32:03,217 --> 02:32:06,718
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is, why don't we just call this whole thing over and Super Metroid wins?

1987
02:32:06,818 --> 02:32:08,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that is what should happen.

1988
02:32:08,578 --> 02:32:10,739
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I agree with you.

1989
02:32:10,919 --> 02:32:12,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Metroid is the greatest game of all time.

1990
02:32:12,819 --> 02:32:17,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you that both years, and I will even tell you this year, it will be my top vote.

1991
02:32:18,584 --> 02:32:21,465
[SPEAKER_03]: but when it gets beaten by crap like Tetris.

1992
02:32:22,325 --> 02:32:25,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Tetris isn't crap, but it's just not Super Metroid.

1993
02:32:26,366 --> 02:32:28,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Super Metroid.

1994
02:32:28,187 --> 02:32:30,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I also had another reason I was calling in.

1995
02:32:31,128 --> 02:32:32,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to promote anything.

1996
02:32:32,128 --> 02:32:43,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a beef with video game marketing and since I've finally called into this show and tuned in for the first time in like five months, my game of the year this year was Borderlands.

1997
02:32:44,732 --> 02:32:45,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Hands down.

1998
02:32:46,550 --> 02:32:53,532
[SPEAKER_03]: But this game didn't get a lot of press because everyone's, you know, staining their pants about Modern Warfare 2.

1999
02:32:53,812 --> 02:32:54,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest with you.

2000
02:32:54,932 --> 02:32:57,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern Warfare 2 is not the best game I've played.

2001
02:32:58,013 --> 02:32:59,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not the best game I've played this year.

2002
02:32:59,493 --> 02:33:01,534
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not the best game I've played in the past five years.

2003
02:33:02,374 --> 02:33:04,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern Warfare 2 is above average.

2004
02:33:05,034 --> 02:33:05,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game.

2005
02:33:06,715 --> 02:33:08,955
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not this amazing thing people make it out to be.

2006
02:33:08,995 --> 02:33:12,016
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why it was this great thing everyone made it out to be is marketing.

2007
02:33:13,556 --> 02:33:15,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish some of these games...

2008
02:33:16,533 --> 02:33:18,694
[SPEAKER_03]: that were great got more marketing.

2009
02:33:19,754 --> 02:33:34,079
[SPEAKER_03]: If Borderlands got the marketing it deserved, I think it would have sold more, people would have liked it more, and the game, from what I noticed, really got popular by a little bit of marketing and a little bit of word of mouth.

2010
02:33:34,639 --> 02:33:40,481
[SPEAKER_03]: But you see games like Katamari Damacy, Psychonauts, gosh, what was the other one I had?

2011
02:33:40,561 --> 02:33:42,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Okami would be a good example.

2012
02:33:43,042 --> 02:33:44,823
[SPEAKER_03]: These games get fantastic reviews.

2013
02:33:46,314 --> 02:33:49,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, in these days, that doesn't mean anything.

2014
02:33:49,275 --> 02:33:50,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's depressing.

2015
02:33:51,096 --> 02:33:51,957
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's weird, though?

2016
02:33:52,077 --> 02:33:52,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it does.

2017
02:33:52,957 --> 02:33:58,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I look at a game like Braid that really did everything based off of that word amount.

2018
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:07,565
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe that's the difference between download title and go into the store and drop $60 because, you know... And one question I usually ask people when they tell me a game's good, I say, well, is it $60 good?

2019
02:34:07,585 --> 02:34:07,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it...

2020
02:34:12,186 --> 02:34:16,227
[SPEAKER_03]: That stems from an old game on my show that Jimmy and I did on our old show way back.

2021
02:34:16,727 --> 02:34:17,888
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I don't even want to remember.

2022
02:34:18,448 --> 02:34:24,649
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had a segment called Actual Retail Price where we would name games that were coming out and we would say what we would actually pay for them.

2023
02:34:25,709 --> 02:34:28,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some cases, I'd pay more than $60 for a game.

2024
02:34:28,450 --> 02:34:31,131
[SPEAKER_03]: In a lot of cases, I'd maybe pay $40 for a game.

2025
02:34:32,051 --> 02:34:33,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at a game like World of Warcraft.

2026
02:34:33,551 --> 02:34:35,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I have paid more than $60 for that game.

2027
02:34:35,692 --> 02:34:37,612
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I've paid more than I care to admit.

2028
02:34:37,632 --> 02:34:37,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2029
02:34:40,612 --> 02:34:43,033
[SPEAKER_03]: But Modern Warfare 2 was not a $60 game.

2030
02:34:44,034 --> 02:34:45,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a $45 game.

2031
02:34:46,155 --> 02:34:54,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to say it, but I needed to get that out because I'm sick... And Nintendo is so guilty of this.

2032
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:57,961
[SPEAKER_03]: All I have to say is Wii Music.

2033
02:34:58,421 --> 02:35:01,643
[SPEAKER_03]: They marketed this as the greatest thing since sliced bread and it was crap.

2034
02:35:01,963 --> 02:35:02,123
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

2035
02:35:03,368 --> 02:35:04,889
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

2036
02:35:28,587 --> 02:35:33,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in this decade alone, we've come to have to pay a lot more for our games.

2037
02:35:33,833 --> 02:35:39,700
[SPEAKER_04]: We're paying now $60 for games, whereas at the beginning of the decade with the whole CD-based thing, we weren't paying so much before.

2038
02:35:40,361 --> 02:35:42,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, the first game I paid $60 for...

2039
02:35:43,604 --> 02:36:09,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter 2 on the Super Nintendo that's true first game I paid $60 for was Killer Instinct on the Super Nintendo I do realize that cartridge based games did raise that expectation earlier but CD was supposed to drop that and now it's come back up again it's very interesting we will talk about a little more of this next week as we start to kind of wrap up the year and the decade because it will be a slow news week you know that so more to come on that next week but thank you so much GMN we appreciate the call as always and keep up the good work with Under Sedation Live

2040
02:36:10,772 --> 02:36:12,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't call it good work, but we'll keep up the work.

2041
02:36:12,953 --> 02:36:13,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the fair work.

2042
02:36:14,434 --> 02:36:15,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy New Year, guys.

2043
02:36:15,895 --> 02:36:18,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if Travis does come out here, you should come with him.

2044
02:36:18,476 --> 02:36:19,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm planning on it.

2045
02:36:19,276 --> 02:36:21,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on synchronizing our trips.

2046
02:36:21,858 --> 02:36:23,498
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have to just make it OLRCon.

2047
02:36:23,598 --> 02:36:24,839
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll rent a hall or something.

2048
02:36:25,099 --> 02:36:30,262
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll rent the Masonic Lodge and just throw ourselves a party.

2049
02:36:30,322 --> 02:36:30,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good, man.

2050
02:36:30,962 --> 02:36:31,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

2051
02:36:31,202 --> 02:36:31,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2052
02:36:33,936 --> 02:36:48,850
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to do it for calls tonight sorry to those who didn't get through but remember you can't always send us an email or you can always give us an offline call or you can always send us an email bag, twitter, whatever you want to do there so sorry to those again who did not get through anyhow

2053
02:36:50,751 --> 02:36:59,097
[SPEAKER_04]: We just... It's about time for us to wrap up the show, but I know Loki might have had some more last-minute stories he wants to get to, but he's too busy laughing over there at the frickin'... I'm not laughing over here.

2054
02:36:59,197 --> 02:37:01,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was laughing at some stuff, but... Oh, okay.

2055
02:37:02,059 --> 02:37:07,242
[SPEAKER_13]: I just... I like how they have I'm on a boat as one of the songs in there, and they have the video for it.

2056
02:37:07,262 --> 02:37:07,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

2057
02:37:11,605 --> 02:37:13,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Other things we'll mention real quick.

2058
02:37:14,107 --> 02:37:24,396
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a game that was originally on the iPhone and the iPod Touch from a French independent developer called Press Start Studios.

2059
02:37:24,556 --> 02:37:28,219
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a hack and slash game called Twin Blades, The Reaping Vanguard.

2060
02:37:29,099 --> 02:37:30,521
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a really awesome looking game.

2061
02:37:30,541 --> 02:37:33,983
[SPEAKER_13]: It's now coming to Xbox Live Indie Games.

2062
02:37:35,705 --> 02:37:39,468
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you should pick it up just because it's incredibly beautiful.

2063
02:37:39,548 --> 02:37:40,549
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all hand-drawn.

2064
02:37:41,950 --> 02:37:43,251
[SPEAKER_13]: The game's coming out for $3.

2065
02:37:45,934 --> 02:37:47,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely worth picking up.

2066
02:37:47,375 --> 02:37:48,516
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like a pretty fun little game.

2067
02:37:49,156 --> 02:37:50,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll have to look for the iPhone one.

2068
02:37:51,513 --> 02:37:58,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the iPhone one is actually already out now and is actually out for 99 cents.

2069
02:37:58,715 --> 02:38:03,157
[SPEAKER_13]: This one will be coming out apparently on Christmas.

2070
02:38:03,857 --> 02:38:04,698
[SPEAKER_13]: So the 25th.

2071
02:38:05,818 --> 02:38:06,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds kind of neat.

2072
02:38:07,178 --> 02:38:19,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Assassin's Creed 2 is getting some download content that's going to kind of bridge the gap between the first and second games and they've added some new abilities including the Spring Jump and that's...

2073
02:38:21,408 --> 02:38:27,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently two different contents between the end of January and the end of February.

2074
02:38:27,614 --> 02:38:33,100
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to have the Battle of Forli and that's going to be for $3.99.

2075
02:38:35,579 --> 02:38:41,044
[SPEAKER_13]: and also, I guess, Bonfire of Vanities, which will run you $4.99.

2076
02:38:42,925 --> 02:38:52,613
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess it's speculated that the two editions will fill in the missing sequence 12 and 13 from the game.

2077
02:38:53,114 --> 02:38:54,295
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's neat.

2078
02:38:55,976 --> 02:39:00,820
[SPEAKER_13]: And lastly, the 3D Blu-ray specs have been finalized.

2079
02:39:01,581 --> 02:39:03,763
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is going to be kind of going forward...

2080
02:39:05,973 --> 02:39:18,020
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if they're going to start this next year, but obviously the big trend in entertainment nowadays is 3D, and they're going to be bringing that to you with Blu-ray.

2081
02:39:19,730 --> 02:39:29,960
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the things that they did include with, of course, the Blu-ray specs is going to be that the 3D will be supported on the PlayStation 3.

2082
02:39:30,420 --> 02:39:35,565
[SPEAKER_13]: So soon you'll be able to, I guess, watch 3D movies on your PlayStation 3.

2083
02:39:35,946 --> 02:39:37,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Makes sense since they have...

2084
02:39:38,468 --> 02:40:08,074
[SPEAKER_13]: similar technology right now available for the Avatar game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 assuming you had the TV to support it and had the glasses that go with it but actually I mean some of those TVs because the Avatar game supported like all sorts of different methods for it one of which is RealD and I didn't even realize that RealD is available for TVs and those glasses are dirt cheap I mean hell you get them you know you go see a 3D movie in the theater you get a free pair of you know those polarized glasses

2085
02:40:08,174 --> 02:40:10,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't you supposed to turn them into the bucket at the end so they can be steamwashed?

2086
02:40:10,675 --> 02:40:10,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that.

2087
02:40:11,055 --> 02:40:14,576
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm paying extra money for, you know, the movie.

2088
02:40:15,216 --> 02:40:16,516
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm keeping those damn glasses.

2089
02:40:17,636 --> 02:40:19,457
[SPEAKER_13]: But yes, for Avatar, I did recycle them.

2090
02:40:19,517 --> 02:40:21,317
[SPEAKER_13]: I did have some before, just in case.

2091
02:40:21,517 --> 02:40:22,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I stole one.

2092
02:40:22,117 --> 02:40:24,378
[SPEAKER_10]: I did have a pair from Disneyland that I accidentally held on to.

2093
02:40:24,398 --> 02:40:28,759
[SPEAKER_13]: If I ever get a TV, though, that does support Real D, I'm keeping those damn glasses.

2094
02:40:29,156 --> 02:40:33,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of 3D and Disneyland, we've got a planned trip in February, y'all.

2095
02:40:33,206 --> 02:40:34,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess who's coming back?

2096
02:40:34,108 --> 02:40:36,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, did you see Princess Tiana?

2097
02:40:36,453 --> 02:40:37,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, I was so excited!

2098
02:40:39,952 --> 02:40:42,473
[SPEAKER_04]: She let me pretend to be the prince, even though the prince was standing right there.

2099
02:40:42,933 --> 02:40:43,454
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

2100
02:40:43,494 --> 02:40:46,915
[SPEAKER_04]: But my female friend that was with me, she posed with the prince, so it worked out.

2101
02:40:46,935 --> 02:40:48,116
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have posed with the prince, too.

2102
02:40:48,556 --> 02:40:50,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have, but there were all these little kids around.

2103
02:40:51,037 --> 02:40:56,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the parents would appreciate those types of questions, so we'll just leave it at that.

2104
02:40:56,680 --> 02:41:04,183
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I obviously had a good time, and I'm excited to go back next year because we've got to see Captain EO.

2105
02:41:04,943 --> 02:41:05,644
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to happen.

2106
02:41:06,104 --> 02:41:08,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you guys, Captain EO is officially coming back in February.

2107
02:41:09,432 --> 02:41:12,093
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2108
02:41:32,839 --> 02:41:34,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about that kind of caught my ear.

2109
02:41:34,401 --> 02:41:37,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, okay, and this Captain EO thing has been announced for a limited run.

2110
02:41:38,146 --> 02:41:40,490
[SPEAKER_04]: What has already been planned for next?

2111
02:41:40,510 --> 02:41:44,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this means something's already been planned for 2011 for that theater.

2112
02:41:44,315 --> 02:41:46,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So Captain EO's going to be there, but only for about a year.

2113
02:41:47,059 --> 02:41:48,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Then something else is coming.

2114
02:41:48,601 --> 02:41:49,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a theory.

2115
02:41:50,049 --> 02:41:50,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a theory.

2116
02:41:50,970 --> 02:41:51,671
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your theory?

2117
02:41:51,751 --> 02:41:52,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Tomorrowland, right?

2118
02:41:53,213 --> 02:41:53,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2119
02:41:53,514 --> 02:41:55,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Pixar is a big thing right now.

2120
02:41:56,218 --> 02:41:59,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess it's a WALL-E movie would take that theater.

2121
02:41:59,823 --> 02:42:01,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a WALL-E movie would be pretty rad.

2122
02:42:01,765 --> 02:42:02,767
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.

2123
02:42:02,887 --> 02:42:04,990
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my bet, is a WALL-E movie replaces Captain Neo.

2124
02:42:06,261 --> 02:42:10,603
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was my way, it'd be Tron, and they'd reopen the monorail and actually make it a good Tron ride.

2125
02:42:10,683 --> 02:42:11,403
[SPEAKER_04]: The PeopleMover?

2126
02:42:11,583 --> 02:42:13,664
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG, yes, please.

2127
02:42:13,864 --> 02:42:14,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So much this.

2128
02:42:15,345 --> 02:42:16,445
[SPEAKER_04]: So much this.

2129
02:42:17,005 --> 02:42:26,769
[SPEAKER_10]: If it wasn't for that stupid guy who decided to dive off the wrong side of it, we would still have us a PeopleMover, and we would still have us the Tron thing, which was the only good part about the PeopleMover.

2130
02:42:27,069 --> 02:42:30,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to make this the Disney show, but we're at the end of the show anyway.

2131
02:42:30,213 --> 02:42:30,954
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot left.

2132
02:42:31,274 --> 02:42:32,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this real quick.

2133
02:42:32,396 --> 02:42:39,644
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I did see at Disneyland that just opened up Friday, reopened up I should say, all new, all completely redone.

2134
02:42:39,684 --> 02:42:40,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very impressed.

2135
02:42:40,565 --> 02:42:42,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln is back.

2136
02:42:42,768 --> 02:42:43,849
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2137
02:43:03,144 --> 02:43:03,745
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna have to do it.

2138
02:43:03,845 --> 02:43:06,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hope that's not Evil Lincoln, who will murder us all.

2139
02:43:06,827 --> 02:43:07,928
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not Evil Lincoln!

2140
02:43:07,988 --> 02:43:14,132
[SPEAKER_13]: I especially love the part when President Lincoln stands up and does his rendition of Lady Gaga's poker face.

2141
02:43:16,614 --> 02:43:18,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Starts mimicking the Bad Romance video, yes.

2142
02:43:18,495 --> 02:43:19,356
[SPEAKER_13]: It really hit me.

2143
02:43:19,816 --> 02:43:21,237
[SPEAKER_01]: In the voice of Christopher Walken.

2144
02:43:22,298 --> 02:43:22,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

2145
02:43:23,899 --> 02:43:26,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, there you go.

2146
02:43:26,881 --> 02:43:32,165
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my little snap Disney review, but they have water back at California Venture.

2147
02:43:33,820 --> 02:43:36,521
[SPEAKER_04]: The main walkway at California Adventure is closed.

2148
02:43:36,561 --> 02:43:37,961
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go all the way around to get anywhere.

2149
02:43:39,341 --> 02:43:41,042
[SPEAKER_04]: California Adventure, I have a cry.

2150
02:43:41,122 --> 02:43:44,503
[SPEAKER_04]: But they really are getting that park ready for 2011.

2151
02:43:45,223 --> 02:43:46,103
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

2152
02:43:46,563 --> 02:43:47,143
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

2153
02:43:47,964 --> 02:43:49,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Aladdin is also closing.

2154
02:43:49,244 --> 02:43:52,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It's announced that the Aladdin show at California Adventure is going to close in August.

2155
02:43:52,845 --> 02:43:54,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably going to Broadway.

2156
02:43:54,465 --> 02:43:55,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't cry too much.

2157
02:43:55,285 --> 02:43:56,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in London's West End right now.

2158
02:43:57,866 --> 02:43:59,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam Anderson is playing the genie.

2159
02:43:59,486 --> 02:44:00,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, what?

2160
02:44:00,627 --> 02:44:01,007
[SPEAKER_04]: But okay.

2161
02:44:01,027 --> 02:44:01,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

2162
02:44:02,307 --> 02:44:04,412
[SPEAKER_04]: but a Toy Story musical is going to replace it.

2163
02:44:04,953 --> 02:44:05,414
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

2164
02:44:05,575 --> 02:44:06,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we'll see.

2165
02:44:06,798 --> 02:44:10,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, Toy Story 3 is in the works.

2166
02:44:11,934 --> 02:44:17,760
[SPEAKER_10]: So... Oh, I'll say about Toy Story 3, they're actually going to be doing an IMAX releases for that.

2167
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:18,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, the 3D.

2168
02:44:18,561 --> 02:44:20,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they did the 3D preview for it.

2169
02:44:20,623 --> 02:44:21,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good times.

2170
02:44:21,344 --> 02:44:23,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, again, how does this relate to video games?

2171
02:44:24,067 --> 02:44:25,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Movie-video game tie-ins.

2172
02:44:25,428 --> 02:44:31,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And the technology, just like Loki's saying about Avatar, you know, this type of technology you're seeing in Avatar is already in the game.

2173
02:44:31,675 --> 02:44:34,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that it's probably too expensive for a lot of you guys to afford.

2174
02:44:34,758 --> 02:44:35,338
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D, Midway Mania

2175
02:44:54,403 --> 02:44:55,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably do a little bit of both.

2176
02:44:55,984 --> 02:44:57,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if we'll have any special guests yet.

2177
02:44:57,564 --> 02:44:58,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to line up some folks.

2178
02:44:58,885 --> 02:45:00,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens over the next week.

2179
02:45:00,266 --> 02:45:05,908
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will be back live again on All Games Radio on the 27th with our last episode of The Decade.

2180
02:45:07,148 --> 02:45:10,770
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can believe it, we've been doing this show most of the decade.

2181
02:45:11,870 --> 02:45:12,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of strange.

2182
02:45:13,976 --> 02:45:15,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've hit seven years.

2183
02:45:16,518 --> 02:45:16,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2184
02:45:16,918 --> 02:45:19,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year will be the eighth year of broadcasting.

2185
02:45:19,580 --> 02:45:23,802
[SPEAKER_04]: 2002 to 2010 and beyond.

2186
02:45:23,962 --> 02:45:24,562
[SPEAKER_11]: We're bored.

2187
02:45:26,043 --> 02:45:31,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, before we close up shop tonight, of course, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts here in studio.

2188
02:45:31,607 --> 02:45:33,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2189
02:45:33,888 --> 02:45:34,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I want cupcakes.

2190
02:45:36,049 --> 02:45:37,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys and cupcakes.

2191
02:45:37,570 --> 02:45:41,672
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, at the grocery store, there's a box that says Betty Crocker on it.

2192
02:45:41,852 --> 02:45:42,453
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll help you out.

2193
02:45:44,333 --> 02:45:45,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought, please.

2194
02:45:47,775 --> 02:45:48,115
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2195
02:45:49,676 --> 02:45:51,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiara, your final thought, please.

2196
02:45:51,277 --> 02:45:52,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being here tonight.

2197
02:45:53,178 --> 02:45:54,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me borrow that top.

2198
02:45:55,319 --> 02:45:55,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Betch.

2199
02:45:56,039 --> 02:45:57,300
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys see the backside.

2200
02:45:57,320 --> 02:45:58,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wearing my Kelly shirt tonight.

2201
02:45:58,740 --> 02:45:59,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a betch.

2202
02:46:00,141 --> 02:46:00,701
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

2203
02:46:01,022 --> 02:46:01,262
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2204
02:46:01,402 --> 02:46:03,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, your final thought tonight.

2205
02:46:04,103 --> 02:46:04,863
[SPEAKER_09]: He just said he didn't know.

2206
02:46:04,903 --> 02:46:05,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought he had a real one.

2207
02:46:05,784 --> 02:46:06,844
[SPEAKER_09]: He forfeited it.

2208
02:46:07,145 --> 02:46:07,985
[SPEAKER_04]: He started to say something.

2209
02:46:08,045 --> 02:46:09,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have anything.

2210
02:46:09,026 --> 02:46:09,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2211
02:46:09,326 --> 02:46:09,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then fine.

2212
02:46:12,128 --> 02:46:12,469
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2213
02:46:12,829 --> 02:46:13,690
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to close up shop.

2214
02:46:14,031 --> 02:46:14,571
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.

2215
02:46:14,612 --> 02:46:15,373
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do it all again.

2216
02:46:15,413 --> 02:46:19,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Our 350th decade end episode.

2217
02:46:19,318 --> 02:46:20,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob better bring cupcakes.

2218
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:25,480
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2219
02:46:26,020 --> 02:46:29,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2220
02:46:29,700 --> 02:46:38,362

2221
02:46:38,842 --> 02:46:50,445

2222
02:46:51,025 --> 02:46:51,825
[SPEAKER_12]: See you next week!
