00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,540
Today, December 20th, 2009, is a leaked survey hinting at a paid Playstation network?

2
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:31,600
What video game related show will soon be on PBS?

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,040
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
Radio.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,200
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
lifestyle.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,720
With you as always over the next few hours here on All Games Radio where we tape live.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,200
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me is the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
How are you?

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm alright.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
You alright?

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Hi.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
A little irritated.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,420
I'm sorry to hear that.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,420
Not at me?

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,420
Did I do something?

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,420
No.

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,420
Okay, I was just saying if I ruffled your feathers I'm extremely sorry.

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,420
No.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,420
Not at you.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,120
Well the show hasn't really started yet so maybe at the end of the show you'll be mad

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
at me.

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
We'll see.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Mom.

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,440
I'll try not to though.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,640
Alright and of course say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Hi.

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,160
Who's chowing down on wings right now.

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Yes.

30
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Alright.

31
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
He's barbecuing.

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
He's been craving them all week.

33
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
Have you really?

34
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
Yeah.

35
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Now the whole room smells like barbecue and damn I am hungry.

36
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
That's alright.

37
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
They're yummy.

38
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
Maybe I'll get a taco after the show.

39
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Well thank you.

40
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
That makes me feel a lot better to know.

41
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
At least you're having yummy food.

42
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
How have you been Loki?

43
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
I've been fine.

44
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Alright.

45
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:38,840
We are back of course on Sunday night taping live at All Games Radio www.allgames.com.

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,060
We tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, or thereabouts right after the Bobby

47
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,440
Black Wolf show.

48
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,160
Our old friend Bobby Black Wolf who does a one man band show right before us at 5 o'clock

49
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,200
Pacific.

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
Although we're starting a little late tonight because we were talking about Game of the

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,040
Decade with Bobby.

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,180
That was kind of the focus of his show tonight because he's got next week off.

53
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,760
And we were talking about Game of the Decade a little bit on his show.

54
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,760
So if you haven't already listened to his show for the week, be sure you do at some

55
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,280
point by checking out thebobbyblackwolfshow.com and downloading his show because we make

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
a cameo.

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
I don't know if you guys know this.

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,200
We make a cameo on his show like every week that we have a show as well.

59
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,800
He's been very good about always kind of having a little toss over to us live.

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,920
So please support our friend Bobby Black Wolf and also the other fabulous programs they

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
have at All Games Radio.

62
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
And I always say this.

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,160
If this is your first time listening to All Games Radio or listening to Orange Lounge

64
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,220
Radio which is a part of that, if this is your first time listening to this show because

65
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,840
maybe a friend sent you over here and you don't know really what the show is about and

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,200
you decide to listen to this show tonight, damn these guys suck.

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,280
They don't talk about anything I really want to hear about and the games they play are

68
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,440
not the games I play.

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
You know what?

70
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,800
Go check out a different show at All Games Radio because there's lots of great independently

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,320
produced shows that do talk about those other games.

72
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm going to admit we're not really going to bring you a lot of chat on Modern Warfare

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
2.

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
It's just not the kind of game I play.

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
I don't think Dark Soccer is really down with the Call of Duty's of the world.

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
I like Call of Duty.

77
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Do you?

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,280
I get motion sick but I like watching Dan play.

79
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Okay well fair enough then.

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,360
But you know we have differing opinions sometimes and I'm not saying that's a bad game.

81
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Heck no.

82
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,160
It's not really a game I have time to play because there's so many other games I try

83
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,840
to squeeze in, both retro and current games.

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,160
Anyhow, speaking of games, let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the games

85
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
that we've been playing this week.

86
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Dark Sakura.

87
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,040
I played Super Mario Wii which is pretty cool if annoying playing multiplayer.

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,440
I don't know I just found the multiplayer aspect to be really irritating so it wasn't

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,120
fun for me that way.

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,680
And a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 which if you ignore the whole Civil War

91
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,120
storyline it's actually a really fun game.

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,520
I hated the Civil War storyline so.

93
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,200
I'm so glad you finally got around to that because I knew we were talking on last week's

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
show kind of joking.

95
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,680
I still haven't played this game but I'm glad you finally were able to do it.

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,280
We played a decent bit of it.

97
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:06,560
And I played of course my peggle a bunch and some solitaire and Dan was showing us the

98
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,920
whole zombie thing in Borderlands and doing the brain hunting thing and like it's kind

99
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,000
of funny because the more you have to go back you like find this the one of the characters

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,160
buddies who's been turned into a zombie and he's tied to his chair so you have to bring

101
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,640
him brains to eat and he keeps asking for more brains.

102
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,040
So as you you start bringing him you know 10 brains and 25 and 50 and as it keeps going

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:42,160
the eh it goes brains for the name of the thing and but I really I don't know I think

104
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,760
I would be happier playing Mario Wii by myself.

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,800
It just.

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
It can get a little frustrating with you know all the chaos going on.

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,480
It gets a lot of frustrating because all I want to do is just to do what I'm doing you

108
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,400
know and it's irritating.

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,440
It's a bummer there's not a game like that on the DS where everybody can kind of do their

110
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,440
own thing on their own screen but yet maybe you're still working together and I think

111
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,480
it's for that real element that you're stuck on that screen.

112
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,280
I mean it's both a blessing and a curse you know.

113
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,640
Well if that is it for your gaming week.

114
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,480
Oh yeah and I played some World of Warcraft.

115
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
There you go.

116
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,160
And how about the one and only Techmaster Loki.

117
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,420
I didn't play a whole lot this week and not as much as I'd want to finishing up Christmas

118
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,580
gifts and stuff.

119
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:39,000
So I played you know Grand Theft Auto, Baligate Tony multiplayer kicking ass constantly in

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that game.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There's.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,800
It's funny because we play with you know we've been playing ranked matches now so anybody

123
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:54,480
can join us is you know play around 10 o'clock you know Pacific and 3 p.m. Pacific each day.

124
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,440
So if you just pretty much just join a you know ranked deathmatch game you're probably

125
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,360
going to get into ours.

126
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,840
And it's funny because we laugh at the people that play with us because most of the time

127
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,040
they end up dropping because we're just so intense in the game.

128
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,800
I mean not that we're talking trash them we don't have microphones or anything but we

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,200
just kick the crap out of everybody.

130
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Mainly I kick the crap out of everybody but you know there's a little bit coming my way

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,620
but it's funny.

132
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,440
And I don't know.

133
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,960
Anyways other than that we've been playing I played more Bayonetta and it's awesome.

134
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,200
I like some of this stuff later on in the game.

135
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,260
You can actually buy new techniques and stuff and one of the techniques I unlocked is like

136
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,880
windmill you know like the breakdancing moves so you spin around with the guns blazing on

137
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,720
your feet or whatever and then she stops and does a freeze pose.

138
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,040
It's awesome.

139
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,120
It's this game is awesome.

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,600
I know I'm so excited.

141
00:06:51,600 --> 00:07:00,080
And then completely off of the Xbox 360 I actually played a little bit of salt which

142
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
is the new game that's in sodium one.

143
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,120
Honestly had no idea what the hell sodium is and to be honest and I know we're going

144
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,320
to talk about this more later on it wasn't that big a deal to me.

145
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
I don't know.

146
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,680
I played that game salt kind of like a hovercraft action game or something like that where you're

147
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,920
blowing up other robotic hovercrafts and stuff and it was neat for a little bit.

148
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,360
You know that's it but it's not something I'd like consistently play.

149
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,440
Well I know we're going to get into it a little later in the show.

150
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,920
I played a little bit of that this week as well and you know although I think the game

151
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,320
itself was a little like I think I played a game like this on the Atari 2600 so this

152
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,840
is a little more souped up you know.

153
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,640
I think technically it's doing some things that we haven't seen home do yet and it's

154
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,040
kind of exciting but we'll get into that a little later.

155
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,080
So yeah that's basically it.

156
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,200
I was going to play some other games on my main cabinet I did try I wanted to play alligator

157
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,160
which is our alligator hunt which I've never heard of the game but it's pretty cool it's

158
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:14,640
kind of like a shooter I guess an on rails shooter thing and it was kind of neat but

159
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,640
I can't get the ROM to work right I'm doing something wrong with my settings or something

160
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,720
but I don't know it'll be cool.

161
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,560
Well let's see my gaming week obviously if you were listening to last week's show I got

162
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,320
that awesome FC Mobile as a gift for the holidays and I went out on a little bit of a binge

163
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I bought some 8-bit games and I borrowed from the vault so I had NES games galore back at

164
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,320
home including an awesome purchase I made at a local games store I went to where you

165
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,040
suggested Jamie and I don't know if I told you what I got there I don't think I did after

166
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,040
last week but I went to that store we talked about and I don't know if you want to say

167
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,900
it on air or not but I went and got Goonies 2 on the NES which is a game I just remember

168
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,520
for you know it wasn't a spectacular I think when it came out but I think it was also underrated

169
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,640
because a lot of people said what the hell does this have to do with the movie but it

170
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,720
actually was a pretty cool game I also bought Slippeed for the Sega CD which I knew which

171
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,800
I knew Dark Sakura would very much approve of I haven't been able to hook that all up

172
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,240
because I don't have the Sega CD hooked up and I've been very lazy on that because I

173
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,680
was out of town this weekend but that's on my to-do list for the week but 8-bit games

174
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,480
yes I've been binging on a lot of those Rygar on the NES I borrowed from the vault Guardian

175
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,960
Legend of course came from Loki with the system and also picked up which I think is Faxanadu

176
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,640
but I think it's actually Fashanadu or something like that I think the X has a different pronunciation

177
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,440
to it which is a game I remember from my childhood also borrowed that from the vault good times

178
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,120
good 8-bit times so I'm like totally reminiscing this week going to our chat room of course

179
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com the always present fourth guest on the show also commenting on

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,480
what's going on tonight start off with Tiger Claw tonight Goonies 2 is a great platform

181
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,400
game but it had those annoying 3D sections yeah especially the front and back thing got

182
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,860
really irritating but you know it wasn't perfect but it still was a game that's out of my memory

183
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,880
but I get what he's saying also as far as my gaming week goes not a whole lot of other

184
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,480
new stuff a little bit of World of Warcraft a little bit of DJ Hero I played that earlier

185
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,640
in the week and got some trophies because I really like DJ Hero it's one of my favorite

186
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,160
games to have come out this year and I don't understand why people are like hating why

187
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,120
it's cool to hate on DJ Hero all of a sudden because maybe it's not selling zillions of

188
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,920
copies like Guitar Hero and Rock Band do I mean I think a lot of this came from those

189
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,520
silly VGA awards that happened was it last week oh yeah that's right because we were

190
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,580
live Saturday not Sunday they happened I guess later Saturday night whatever who cares right

191
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,920
it's just what some people claim to think is the best game of the year when that's an

192
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,160
opinion left to the individual but I guess it created a stir that DJ Hero won best music

193
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,660
game over the Rock Band Beatles I think one can admit they're both really good music games

194
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,700
not to hate on Rock Band Beatles I think it's an amazing game but you know you did have

195
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:28,480
an existing song list granted you know songs of a generation just huge songs in an existing

196
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,720
engine whereas I think DJ Hero did something new and had some pretty awesome songs I mean

197
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm not hating on either game I just think DJ Hero is not as horrible as some of the

198
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
haters are making it out to be all of a sudden I would have given it to DJ Hero too and I

199
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,260
think a lot of people like following you in the negative press or whatever and they like

200
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,600
to be right so you know they try to agree with the majority you know because they don't

201
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,520
want to be challenged and stuff like that so that's a lot of it that's why you hear

202
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,200
a lot of people echoing the same you know thoughts because if none of those stats were

203
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,120
posted online or how the internet didn't exist you know these people probably wouldn't think

204
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,480
too poorly upon the game well you know what I say haters to the left because you ain't

205
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,200
right that's right you can quote me on that too that's really it otherwise I also oh one

206
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,120
other quick thing steam's having a big sale this weekend and torchlight is half off and

207
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,320
I played the demo which I talked about a few weeks ago on the show about three weeks ago

208
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,320
or so and I I indulged and bought the full version of that game and I'm very excited

209
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,320
to play that later when I get home so next week I'm sure I'll be talking about that anyhow

210
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,280
that pretty much does it for our gaming weeks a little bit of housekeeping tonight we have

211
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,840
there's actually some big news in housekeeping first the little yet important things out

have been spreading the word to friends and all that so thank you guys so much to everyone

217
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,880
who's contributed to that and helping spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because

218
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,920
you know we do do this show for free speaking of spreading the word how awesome is this

219
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:23,200
the community myself Jamie Matt we have nothing to do with this honestly I mean we didn't

220
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,000
we didn't help with this we didn't contribute to this but I'll be damned if we don't love

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,840
this and support this and that is this olr revolution second mix I'm sure you guys are

222
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,520
familiar this has been on the front of our site and I think it came up last week it's

223
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,440
this DDR step mania skin that has an orange lounge radio theme to it and they've taken

224
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,800
all these songs from the cage match segment if you've ever listened to the show live you

225
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,080
know what that is or kind of inside jokes like I don't know if like the Daytona theme

226
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,920
is in the game but it probably is you know things that are like jokes on this show and

227
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,880
have put them into this yo DDR step mania thing and I guess John or DMN from understation

228
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,720
live did all the announcer voices because you know when when orange launch radio was

229
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,280
a station that show was on our station so you know that's certainly a part of the oil

230
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,480
our family too it's just this whole thing that we didn't do it I wish I could be sitting

231
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,960
here saying hey you should download this game because dark soccer Loki myself worked very

232
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,600
hard on it and you know it's it's what we do but no no it's all the community and the

233
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,960
people on our forums that did this and I'm gonna tell you right up don't expect a VGA

234
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,320
award-winning type of game here I mean it is there's some very silly things in there

235
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,440
I've seen some of the videos on the YouTube channel that they have I believe it's ol revolution

236
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,040
some of the youtubes they have up I I have to admit I've been given an advance copy of

237
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,300
the game but because I was out of town this weekend I didn't get a chance to check it

238
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,200
out so sorry but I saw that I did watch the videos and just looking at some of the songs

239
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,320
that are in it like I'm just I'm facepalming because like they found shit that I did live

240
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,960
where I would sing along to songs because I was that bored and that's what was funny

241
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,960
back in 2002 when we were first learning how to broadcast somebody saved that shit and

242
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:17,400
is now in this game I mean how embarrassing karaoke I should I should old karaoke I should

243
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:24,000
not be encouraged God if like a prayer showed up in there I'm gonna die Rob what is it Loki

244
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,400
is like a prayer in there I think it is fuck I found the video for it fuck like seriously

245
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,880
I should not be encouraging people to seek this out it's okay the time that you guys

246
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,880
wanted to do you know the funny stuff again remember we tried to yeah give me the sinker

247
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,960
okey again yeah so oops I did it again is in there as well so great so yeah we I'm

248
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,900
sure we all have a little bit of embarrassment in there but okay whatever you know I can

249
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,360
look past the silliness and the fact that you know what they're doing it cuz you know

250
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,440
somebody thought it was cool as as dumb as it was and they made a game out of it I think

251
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,360
it's awesome and it's such like as individuals who have been doing this for free for going

252
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,500
on eight years now and not really seeing any money out of this in fact oftentimes losing

253
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,080
a lot of money into this it's that that's like total reward right there so thank you

254
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,640
guys so much to the community and everybody that put that together I understand it is

255
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:26,200
coming out Christmas Eve so stay tuned 1224 of 09 to orange lounge radio.com I think they're

256
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,400
putting the finishing touches on that right now so thank you so much to the community

257
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,560
for putting that together we might get some phone calls of that later I know I gotta tell

258
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,120
earlier in the show about one of the developers behind it is going to call in and tell us

259
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,840
all about it and so we'll find out some more anyhow that's all I have for housekeeping

260
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:50,160
sorta I want to get into the news tonight but first I want to talk about this because

261
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,080
this didn't make the show world tonight because dark Sakura and Loki really kind of did things

262
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,640
because I was out this weekend so I'm thanks to everybody for picking up the slack because

263
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,120
I wasn't here but I saw something on the internet literally in the 15 minutes I was home between

264
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,960
the time I got back from LA and the time I came over to do orange laundry tonight that

265
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,040
pissed me off and so obviously didn't make the show world because because the others

266
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,400
didn't know about it but I have to say something about it because I'm so angry at this that

267
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,480
I have to say something about it and it has to do with something I actually saw on Kotaku

268
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,040
but it's not Kotaku I'm mad at in fact I think they're great there's lots of great video

269
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,240
game blogs out there that I check regularly as I'm sure most of you do and Kotaku is one

270
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,940
of them and when I was home for a few minutes I checked the site in my reader and saw that

271
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:40,400
they had just run a story about out magazines gayest games ever list or I think the actual

272
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,300
name of the list is the gayest video games that they put together this list that is running

273
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:52,920
on out magazine very little journalistic contents content to this nobody signed the article

274
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,460
so I don't know who did it but and if you read it you can pretty much figure out why

275
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:05,080
I really shouldn't be encouraging you to seek this out because this list is not only stupid

276
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:12,040
but it's so stupid it's offensive I am offended by this article you want to know why listen

277
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,360
to such gem excerpts such as this the gayest video games obviously I can't read the entire

278
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,000
article but it's because it's copyright but for you know purposes of criticism I can cite

279
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,400
certain pieces of it Super Mario Brothers makes the list which they put a video of Super

280
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:38,720
Mario Brothers 3 but they describe Super Mario Brothers cleaning pipes and taking names get

281
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:47,520
it because like cleaning pipes is like a euphemism for gay sex that's so funny let's see moving

282
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,680
on with this Contra two bare-chested dudes on a mission neither can accomplish without

283
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,800
the other widely thought to have influenced any products before she penned the short story

284
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:12,560
to Brokeback Mountain so you don't have to play the game with two people and anyone that

285
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,840
has spent enough time with this game kind of knows that right yeah let's see what else

286
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,080
oh here was my favorite this is the last one I'm gonna read here burger time the yeah burger

287
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:32,000
time is apparently a gay video game the slap some meat between those buns tagline was jettisoned

288
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,900
for the less memorable let's get cooking but this 1982 arcade title was created as a witty

289
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:45,760
and fun commentary on the closeted state of male-to-male sexuality in the early 1980s no

290
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:56,080
it wasn't it's about a fucking hamburger really really you are a gay magazine and you are

291
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,460
reinforcing these stereotypes that we have all come to hate and despise and try to fight

292
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,760
against in the wake of things like proposition 8 in California and proposition 1 in Maine

293
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,620
and I'm sorry I'm getting loud to those in studio but that's how mad I get like the this

294
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:20,360
mentality sets back what we've tried to accomplish by going back to these schoolyard tactics

295
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,300
of well if X&Y is true then teehee you must be gay because so-and-so talks with the lisp

296
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,180
you're a faggot do you know how many times I had to hear that growing up and what you're

297
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,880
doing in this magazine article is that any better because they're bare-chested dudes

298
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,560
going on an adventure together this makes this a gay video game I'm sorry I find that

299
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:49,040
to be offensive nowhere here in this article does it talk about Dragon Age a game where

300
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,060
you can have a same gender relationship if you want or not your choice or how about what

301
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,100
I consider to be one of the most landmark games for homosexual content ever made The

302
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:05,200
Sims yeah if you want to have a gay relationship go for it if you don't don't what you do in

303
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,000
your walls is your choice does that game come up in this article no because to some junior

304
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,400
high school graduate here it's apparently not funny but putting a list of games in a

305
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,760
blender that are apparently popular and finding deal it's like it's like a four-year-old trying

306
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,800
to force and I said this is part of my comment which by the way funny funny hasn't posted

307
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,560
yet because it has to screen for editorial so watch this content won't appear but as

308
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,820
I said in the comment it's like trying to watch a four-year-old jam a square peg into

309
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,760
a round hole you're creating a list of reasons why they're gay you know it's like when you

310
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:47,120
read these piss me off to when these gay rags do this they post a list of oh well Jake Gyllenhaal

311
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,960
must be gay because he bottomed for Heath Ledger or he looks good without a shirt off

312
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:01,200
you know or whatever reason they pick up how is that any better from what you faced as

313
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,000
a homosexual man or a bisexual man or somebody in the minority your entire life how is what

314
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,020
you're saying any better than that because you do one thing you must be gay this list

315
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,780
is stupid this list is has nothing to do with gay people it has nothing to do with video

316
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,800
games it's insulting and I denounce it and if you are a gay man listening to this show

317
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,880
which I've been blessed amongst the seven or eight years to meet many gay people that

318
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,480
listen to the show and have said many nice things about you know what we do here and

319
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,560
all that stuff you should be fucking pissed to hit you are a straight man who plays video

320
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,000
games you should be fucking pissed at this because they don't know what the hell they're

321
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,760
talking about an out magazine if you want to write about video games and hire someone

322
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,880
who knows what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to video games and has the balls

323
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,800
to sign their articles and has the balls to sign their article and has and is going to

324
00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:01,240
sign a check that they're asking cash no pun intended it's just ridiculous I mean my

325
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Oh my God, if Joe and Niki had been on the list, at least I could see that.

326
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,240
I mean, I would think that's a little stupid, but come on.

327
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,240
Jamie, Loki, am I crazy? Do I have a point?

328
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,240
No, you're not crazy. Is that magazine, though, just for men, specifically?

329
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Out Magazine? I don't know. I don't subscribe. I hear it's been around forever.

330
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,240
But clearly you can understand why I'm not going to subscribe to these types of magazines.

331
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,240
As a woman, I'm actually kind of offended by that, too.

332
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:35,240
I believe Out is specifically targeted at gay men, but I'm sure they're not going to say no to a lesbian who wants to buy it.

333
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:44,240
I just think that that's completely baffling and silly that they could even pass something like that and think that it would be actually funny.

334
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:53,240
I mean, if the whole list is strictly for parody, it should say parody, and then maybe. It might be remotely funny.

335
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:01,240
It still would be about as funny as World War II. It's not funny.

336
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
I'm trying to play devil's advocate.

337
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
I understand.

338
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,240
That would be the only thing that I could remotely see something like that maybe passing to be posted.

339
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Oh, no, this is satire. This is parody. This is us making fun of other people by sort of the Colbert action, you know what I mean?

340
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,240
How he makes fun of Republicans by acting like an uber-Republican.

341
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,240
But other than that, if there's no type of disclaimer about that, then no.

342
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,240
In fact, actually, I would say don't just post a comment on there.

343
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Actually get their address and mail something in.

344
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,240
I'm curious to see. Just for sake, real quick, I know we're pushed for time tonight, but I just want to read what I said on the article.

345
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Because you may not see this.

346
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Yeah.

347
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
If you see this, then they let it run.

348
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
We'll post it up on our forums, too.

349
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Here's the comment I made.

350
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,240
As a gay man and a long-time gaming enthusiast, I find this meat compilation to be not only horribly misinformed but offensive.

351
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Nowhere on this list are games mentioned that actually meant anything to gay representation in games.

352
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Love who you want to love in The Sims.

353
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Choose to have a same-gender night of passion in Dragon Age.

354
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
Or not.

355
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Not even a frickin' bone tossed at controversial gay content in games such as the hidden kiss in Bully or the lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect.

356
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,240
This article looks like an extremely casual gamer took a list of games that they actually remembered playing as a child, threw them in a blender,

357
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,240
and like a four-year-old trying to put a square peg in a round hole, invented a reason why the game is gay.

358
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,240
It's the equivalent of saying if X is true, well, then it must be gay.

359
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Such as if so-and-so talks with a lisp and has a six-pack, well, they must be gay.

360
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,240
No one likes a stereotype, so why a magazine like this would sink to such a juvenile level is ridiculous.

361
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Shame on you for the space-filling, attention-grabbing, immature piece of garbage.

362
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
Because that's what it is. It is garbage.

363
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,240
And I'm mad because I'm so disappointed.

364
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
I am so disappointed.

365
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:52,240
I'm sure whoever wrote this article, assuming they're gay, hell, assuming they're straight working in a gay magazine,

366
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,240
at some point in their life has had a stereotype passed on to them.

367
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,240
And to just turn around and post this crap in the face of that is disappointing.

368
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
It's so disappointing that I'm angry.

369
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Out, do the right thing, and renounce this article and apologize.

370
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
I demand it.

371
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,240
And if you demand it too, which you should, out.com.

372
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
And I don't know. I could read the whole-

373
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Call for a boycott until we do.

374
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
Just go to the website and tell someone you're pissed, because I know I'm pissed.

375
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Anyhow.

376
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Maybe I will send us a letter to the editor. I don't know.

377
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Black Wolf says in chat I would send us a letter to the editor.

378
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
Maybe I should. I don't know.

379
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
We'll see what happens tomorrow.

380
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Remember, remember. I think whether or not it's posted, you should still send it to the editor.

381
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Because keep in mind, what's one of the big things that I personally believe by is that if you don't bring something to the attention of someone who can do something about it, then it's just going to keep going on.

382
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Okay, fair enough. Here's what I'll do.

383
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,240
I will write a letter to the editor if all of you who are just as pissed off as I am will write a letter to the editor too.

384
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,240
I still think you should write it despite everything, but I mean, I'll write one.

385
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
I'm trying to encourage everyone.

386
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
No, everyone. I'll write one.

387
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Great. Great. Then we have a cause.

388
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,240
This is a much more important cause than President Cat, might I add.

389
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
But President Cat's pretty damn important.

390
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,240
President Cat is pretty damn awesome.

391
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Honestly, I want to say this again, because I know not everybody who listens to this show is gay. Duh.

392
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,240
I know we have tons of straight guys, straight gals that listen to this program.

393
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Honestly, if you're a straight guy, this list should piss you off too.

394
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Straight guys. I know there's some that listen. Straight guys that do musical theater.

395
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,240
How many times have you been called gay just because you do musical theater and you like music and you like all that stuff?

396
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Honestly, if you think about what's going on here, it's the same thing.

397
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Yeah.

398
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,240
And you should be offended. You might be more pissed off than I am, honestly.

399
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Contra being an inspiration for Brokeback Mountain, please.

400
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,240
The book was written?

401
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,240
I think the book was probably written before that game ever came out. I'm not sure.

402
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,240
I'll have to find out. But yeah, it's just ridiculous.

403
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.

404
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,240
I mean, I was in band and I played softball for a little while.

405
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Question in the chat room. What about bisexuals or pansexuals or asexuals?

406
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Anyone who hates stereotypes should be offended by this article.

407
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,240
So if you hate bisexual stereotypes, you know, like bisexual or just bisexual because they're sluts.

408
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
That's a stereotype.

409
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
No, no, no. This is what I get.

410
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Or asexuals or asexual because they can't get any. That's a stereotype. Just like these.

411
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,240
This is the stuff that I get. I'm married, but I've had girlfriends in the past.

412
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,240
And it's just like, oh, well, you're married now, so you're not. It doesn't change.

413
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,240
It just means I found someone I fell in love with. It doesn't change anything.

414
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,240
So I'm totally pissed off by that.

415
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Just do whatever.

416
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,240
I hate stereotypes. I may bring up a stereotype just to make fun of the fact that it exists.

417
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Because I think that if you can't laugh at something, then you're taking life too seriously.

418
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,240
I laugh at the lack of intelligence on that part of these people.

419
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,240
I laugh because it's sad and pathetic.

420
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,240
But there is a time when things do go too far, I think.

421
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Especially from a, quote, trusted resource.

422
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Just honestly, honestly, and I'll leave it with this.

423
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,240
And I know Loki's sitting over there very quiet, probably waiting to get into gaming news.

424
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
But let me say this.

425
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Honestly, just do whatever the fuck you want to do.

426
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,240
Kids, go do whatever the fuck you want to do.

427
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Except camels.

428
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Just as long as you don't hurt other people.

429
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,240
And this article hurts.

430
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Right, Loki?

431
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Sure.

432
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Alright.

433
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
He has meat.

434
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
No, I was going to let you do gaming news.

435
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,240
No, it's fine. I didn't really have anything to contribute.

436
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Am I right? It's stupid.

437
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,240
I saw the article when I was looking for stories.

438
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
I was like, eh, no list.

439
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Skip right past it.

440
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,240
And that's pretty much, you know...

441
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,240
So you had the journalistic integrity to go, this is stupid, skip. Right?

442
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
I didn't even have to read the list. I just saw the list.

443
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
No, gay is video games.

444
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
That's dumb. Okay, next.

445
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
Well, I clicked it because I was...

446
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,240
Honestly, my curiosity was, oh, I wonder if Dragon Age got really high because it's a new game.

447
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
Because I'm thinking, oh, this is going to be like a...

448
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,240
And then when I read it, I was like, my jaw hit the floor.

449
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
I was like, I can't believe...

450
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to spend 20 minutes of the show ranting about it.

451
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,240
We can talk about real gaming news now. Real gaming news, folks. Real gaming news.

452
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Anyways, let's start things off with Out Magazine's top gay games list.

453
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Oh, wait, no.

454
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,240
So yes, as rumored and as we've been talking about before,

455
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:07,240
the water expansion for LittleBigPlanet is going to be hitting the PlayStation Network before Christmas.

456
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
And it is coming out this week.

457
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,240
And to kind of tie with it, and I'm surprised I didn't think of it before,

458
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,240
you'll be getting the Pirates of the Caribbean content.

459
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Yes, much like they did with the Metal Gear Solid pack in introducing the Painator,

460
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,240
the water pack will be coming with a Pirates of the Caribbean level pack

461
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,240
to kind of introduce all the elements that are with the water.

462
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
And those will be out on the PlayStation Network on the 22nd.

463
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,240
And including with that will be a six-pack of Pirates costumes including Jack Sparrow,

464
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Davy Jones, Will Turner, and some of the other characters in the actual movie.

465
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,240
And also you can get a free cannibal costume as well if you don't want to buy any of that stuff.

466
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,240
At the very least you get a free cannibal costume.

467
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
And I can't wait to buy this.

468
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,240
I'm so glad after such a sad, angry news item that we have something that makes me happy again.

469
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,240
And this makes me happy that LittleBigPlanet is still getting some love all this time later.

470
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
And I know this has been sprinkled throughout the past few shows.

471
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Isn't it weird that this game is a year old

472
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,240
and I seriously think LittleBigPlanet has come up every show for like the past month

473
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,240
leading up to this, the release of this pack, and I think it's going to be awesome.

474
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I'm excited to see how water is going to change the game, especially in the fan levels.

475
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,240
I mean, don't get me wrong, the Pirates levels are probably going to be awesome

476
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,240
because the Metal Gear Solid levels, that was some of the best bargain DLC.

477
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,240
It was almost like playing a new game for seven, eight bucks.

478
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,240
I'm excited to see what this is going to bring.

479
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Definitely. And it's going to be five pirate themed levels.

480
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,240
They're going to have four new audio tracks in there, new backgrounds, and that kind of stuff.

481
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,240
And I just can't wait to play it. Seriously, this week is going to be awesome.

482
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:55,240
To kind of go with that, real quick, a little bit LittleBigPlanet related, but not.

483
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:03,240
There was an advertisement for LittleBigPlanet accessories for the PSP, and this is straight from Sony.

484
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:11,240
Funny thing about that is, that advertisement lists the PSP 4000 on top of the PSP Go.

485
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,240
Huh.

486
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:22,240
So perhaps they're going to have another reiteration of the PSP coming out.

487
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Even though the Go is where it's at now, right?

488
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Even though it's still listed on there, but it's actually separate from the PSP Go.

489
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:41,240
It's the PSP 4000. And I remember back a while ago, they had some graphics for the PSP 4000 as well, a little icon for it, months ago.

490
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:50,240
So, much like other Sony rumors, I'm going to say that probably we're going to hear about the PSP 4000 within the next few months.

491
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,240
That's really surprising to me, because I would think with the Go, as much of a hard time as we've given it on this program,

492
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,240
you'd think that if the company really believes in it, they're going to put all their might behind it.

493
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:07,240
But to kind of come out and say, oh well, we're going to go back to the old design and the 4000, which implies by nature that it's like the 3000,

494
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,240
but with some changes, just like all the other iterations before it, that they're going to go away.

495
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,240
In other words, this sounds like it's going to be a UMD-enabled machine.

496
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if it's just something simple like adding onboard storage, because that doesn't take up that much space,

497
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:37,240
and why they couldn't do that in the first place. Or someone was theorizing that they may go the route where they're going to include a camera built in to compete with the DSI,

498
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,240
so that you can use the camera support, since it does support the camera.

499
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:48,240
They just never have released a camera over here for the PSP, even though it's built into our firmware.

500
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,240
I'm reading some comments from chat room. First, I want to say this about the water piece of LittleBigPlanet.

501
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,240
Ionotropic said, whoops, where was it? I just saw it. It was something about the water. There it is.

502
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Water levels always suck. Do not want. You know what, though?

503
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,240
But think about what the water is going to do in the user-created levels.

504
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,240
That's what's most exciting. I mean, because water means free movement anywhere, right?

505
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,240
No jumping, whatever. It's free movement. That could be very interesting for some of the user-created things.

506
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Yeah. I think. We'll see, though.

507
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,240
ToaGak says in our chat room at chat.orensonsradio.com, 4,000? Are they going to remove features again?

508
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,240
Even the 3,000 lost a feature, the infrared port. Then the Go lost the UMD, so what's this going to lose?

509
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Well, the infrared port, I can understand, because they didn't use it for anything.

510
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,240
I mean, other than Homebrew, which enabled use of it, but it didn't really use it for anything.

511
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,240
I mean, they were going to possibly use it for a keyboard or something, but it never did.

512
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,240
I know what the PSP 4,000 will do. It's going to finally stop piracy for good.

513
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,240
No, wait. For real this time, guys. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. For real.

514
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,240
We're going to stop piracy and Homebrew on the PSP for good. That's what the 4,000 is all about.

515
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,240
That's awesome that you're going to do that, except that there's all these other versions of the PSP out there that people can still pirate on.

516
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,240
Why would they buy a new system that's not going to be able to do what they want to do?

517
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:18,240
It'd be the equivalent of them making new currency that has all these counterfeiting preventive measures built into it.

518
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
But we're going to accept the old currency, too.

519
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,240
Then why would you try to counterfeit the new currency? You're just going to counterfeit the old one. It's stupid.

520
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,240
I like this comment in our chat room. Joshi16 says,

521
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,240
When will the PSP become over 9,000? That's a fair question.

522
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Maybe another five years.

523
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
That's a fair question.

524
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
All right. Well, moving on to other Sony news.

525
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:48,240
There's a report out there that apparently there's a survey from an online research company that has been sent out that apparently is looking at interest in a premium subscription to PSN.

526
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Sony's kind of thinking about if they ask for membership fees, they could do some extra goodies and so forth.

527
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:05,240
For example, hour-long trials for full PS3 titles, access to PS1 classics and cross-game voice chat, which apparently is still not...

528
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,240
I always thought that was kind of there in PS3 games, but apparently it is still not there.

529
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Let's see. Also something called cloud storage, which is similar to what we have with Steam Cloud,

530
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,240
which basically could be an online space where you could store saved data and then you could pull your saved games from this cloud.

531
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,240
So this is very good for when you're going over to friends' houses and so forth.

532
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:36,240
The survey also drops hints that they're thinking about things like streaming Netflix without a disk, Hulu support, free access to minis, premium things and so forth.

533
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,240
Now, I would not read too much into these types of surveys.

534
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
Surveys are surveys.

535
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,240
They're gauging interest and they're going to throw all sorts of possibilities out there that might not have been thought up by Sony.

536
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
They might have been thought up by the marketing company.

537
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I mean, it's that old corporate mentality of let's throw things against the wall and see what sticks.

538
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:00,240
So, I mean, it's not to say that nothing here is ever going to come true.

539
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Someone with power is thinking about it, but I don't think there's need to flail and panic just yet.

540
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Loki? Dark Sakura? What do you think? Agree? Disagree?

541
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Some of it will probably come true because all the Sony rumors seem to come true sooner or later.

542
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,240
They have lasers getting leaked.

543
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:24,240
I think in some ways, if you think about it, Sony is already doing a pay for membership system.

544
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Hello? They already have their core magazine.

545
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,240
That magazine unlocks special demos such as the Mod Nation Racers Beta.

546
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,240
It does all these special things and special access.

547
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Don't you think Sony kind of already has it?

548
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
They're just not calling it what Xbox calls it?

549
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Yeah.

550
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,240
I mean, that's kind of my thought on it is that all these things they're talking about,

551
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,240
things that could possibly get expanded to core.

552
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Although, I don't know, when you talk about such core features, no pun intended,

553
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,240
like cross-game voice chat, that is a little like, wow, they would really charge for that.

554
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,240
I mean, you get that free on the Xbox, don't you at least?

555
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,240
I mean, I know you can't play games, but I guess then at the same time,

556
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,240
you can play games for free on Sony's network and you can't do that on Xbox.

557
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,240
So what might be considered a core feature one system might not be for another.

558
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
I don't know.

559
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:24,240
But I think a lot of the problems with the Sony system is that they don't have their own network.

560
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Well, I mean, they have their own network, but they don't have their dedicated servers basically.

561
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,240
It's just all, you know, each company has their own servers for PlayStation games

562
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,240
since everything on Xbox Live is basically on the Microsoft servers.

563
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,240
Cross chat, cross servers is going to be tough because, you know,

564
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
it's all these different servers you have to go through.

565
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
I mean, I don't know.

566
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,240
I guess they could do it if they really wanted to.

567
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Let's go to the chat room for some other comments on the story.

568
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
GameGuru in our chat room says,

569
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Doesn't Sony realize that their free service is the only advantage PSN has over Xbox Live?

570
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,240
DJ Tyrant says, I really enjoy core to be honest.

571
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
I heart Veronica Belmont.

572
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,240
There are a lot of core fans out there.

573
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,240
I mean, I personally don't subscribe, but I don't think it's a stupid idea.

574
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I think it's actually a pretty decent one for the folks that want to, you know, pay the money to have it.

575
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,240
You know, a lot of folks used, I mean, it's just the modern equivalent of buying the magazine

576
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,240
that came with the demo discs, and you were paying for those.

577
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,240
So, it's kind of the modern equivalent of that, honestly.

578
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,240
So, anyhow, if you have other thoughts on that, of course, our mailbag is always open.

579
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, but for now, some more gaming news.

580
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Yes, DarkSagra?

581
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,240
Yes, we have some news regarding SingStar.

582
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
My favorite.

583
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Well, of course, I gave you ABBA.

584
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,240
There's a SingStar viewer application to be released, well, it doesn't have a date yet,

585
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:57,240
but to be coming out for PS3 that has a different social networking.

586
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,240
You can do different things with the players.

587
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,240
It's actually called SingStar Viewer, like I said, which would be in your games folder.

588
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,240
You can browse and purchase songs from the SingStar.

589
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,240
You can vote on videos and photos and rate stuff, and it's supposed to be free.

590
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,240
And you also should be able to use it even when you do not have the SingStar disc in the system.

591
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:29,240
And again, not a date yet on it, but it says that it should be in the coming weeks.

592
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Well, that's kind of neat, but that was also, like, for me, kind of a selling point of SingStar,

593
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
was that, you know, you had access to this.

594
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Because I don't know if you've ever gone on, for those that own SingStar on the PS3,

595
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
if you've ever gone on there and really, and you can have any of them,

596
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,240
Volume 1, Volume 2, ABBA Queen, doesn't matter which one you have,

597
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,240
go on to there and look at some of the YouTubes people do.

598
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,240
There's actually some pretty funny stuff on there.

599
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,240
A lot of times the stuff that's high-rated is, like, people's kids.

600
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,240
A lot of, like, you know, four-year-old child prodigies that sing get highly ranked.

601
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
But, like, there's just some really funny stuff there.

602
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Like, the guy who dresses up in the Stormtrooper outfit to dance to I Don't Feel Like Dancing.

603
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,240
Like, just dumb stuff.

604
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,240
But it's the same type of dumb stuff we watch on YouTube.

605
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Yeah.

606
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,240
So I guess extra publicity for the game is never a bad thing, right?

607
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Everyone gets their five minutes of fame?

608
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,240
Yeah, I guess, you know, and it's also kind of one of those things where

609
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,240
I think that's where it ultimately might help drive sales,

610
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
is that people download this and go,

611
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,240
oh, this is really funny, but I can do better.

612
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,240
My nephew can sing better than this kid,

613
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
or I got an outfit that outdo's this one,

614
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,240
so they're going to go buy the game so they can get it on the SingStar channel.

615
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
It's interesting.

616
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,240
It's certainly a selling point of the game that Lips doesn't have,

617
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
or Karaoke Revolution doesn't have,

618
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
or hell, even Rock Band doesn't have this.

619
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,240
You can't save your performances from Rock Band.

620
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,240
Could you imagine, and, oh, God,

621
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,240
maybe this is something they're going to cook up for Rock Band 3.

622
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
Oh, wow, I think I might be on to something, can't you?

623
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,240
Especially in this whole thing that we're getting into,

624
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,240
can you imagine if Rock Band 3 had this type of,

625
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,240
I think that might be it.

626
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,240
I bet that's where they're going to go with this.

627
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,240
Some type of share your performance on the internet type thing?

628
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
Probably.

629
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,240
I mean, if they're-

630
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
SingStar Idol?

631
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
They're doing it the other way right now, aren't they?

632
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,240
Where if you're a band, put your song in Rock Band for the masses to consume.

633
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,240
Oh, man, I bet that's what's coming in Rock Band 3.

634
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
Share your performance with the internet.

635
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Watch. Watch.

636
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
Because right now, SingStar's got the leg up on it,

637
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,240
but I wonder, if this thing is successful,

638
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,240
only a matter of time before the other music games notice.

639
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Loki, if there was a Rock Band 3 with internet connectivity,

640
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,240
would you consider uploading some of your epic performances to it?

641
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
I don't really play it that much, sadly.

642
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Really?

643
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,240
Yeah.

644
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,240
Oh my gosh, I would love to see you doing the Timmy song.

645
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,240
Lords of the Underworld.

646
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,240
Maybe.

647
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
Alright.

648
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,240
Well, another thing that you can kind of share in would be the new Sodium 1,

649
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,240
which is kind of an MMO, I guess, on home.

650
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,240
I don't know, I apparently ignored the whole MMO part of it

651
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,240
because I actually checked it out a little bit.

652
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,240
It's a self-contained social MMO, they're calling it,

653
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
within PlayStation Home,

654
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,240
and you kind of go through this teleporter that's in the central plaza,

655
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,240
and you go in there and talk to this AI chick called Vicky,

656
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,240
and she gives you different minigames and whatnot that you can play,

657
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,240
including some different objective-based metagames,

658
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,240
and I also have a full arcade-style game to play as well called the Assault Shooter,

659
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,240
which I thought was kind of fun,

660
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,240
but I think, as you were saying, it's a little bit like Battlezone, I think,

661
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,240
the old Atari game.

662
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,240
I feel like I've played a game like it on the PC back when I had a 386,

663
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
and I don't remember what the game was,

664
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,240
but it was one of those things that you would call up on the modem and play.

665
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
Oh man, I distinctly remember the game.

666
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,240
It was very popular, too.

667
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
There were graphics like Battlezone, but it was this whole type of thing

668
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,240
where you were out in the field and you would shoot tanks.

669
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,240
I want to say I've played this game before, you know?

670
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,240
And then, of course, you get different unlocks for leveling up in the game.

671
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
Apparently, the Assault Shooter game that's in there,

672
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,240
only five levels are available in the game for free,

673
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,240
and you have to buy more.

674
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,240
I guess more levels and items are unlockable through microtransactions.

675
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
Yeah, I think I would have played it up to about level five.

676
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,240
I played it only through level three before I got tired of doing it

677
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,240
because I was working on some other stuff.

678
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,240
But if I had to pay for more levels than that, I don't think I'm going to.

679
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,240
But to me, though, this game didn't seem any different

680
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,240
than the other ones already available in the home,

681
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,240
and I just miss the whole MMO part of it

682
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,240
and how this is even really that innovative.

683
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,240
Well, I don't know if I would call it an MMO

684
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,240
because at least the shooting part of it, that's not multiplayer.

685
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
No.

686
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,240
Now, the drink-making game, that was kind of multiplayer.

687
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,240
If you play as the bartender, someone else is calling the drinks,

688
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,240
and if you're ordering the drinks, someone else has to play the bartender.

689
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,240
There's, I guess, that, but that's a bit of a stretch.

690
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,240
I don't know if I'd call it an MMO.

691
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,240
But what I thought was interesting about this

692
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,240
is the way it kind of fit into the context of home.

693
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,240
And it kind of showed off these features of home

694
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,240
that I didn't realize were there,

695
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,240
such as the ability to interact with what's on the web.

696
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,240
If you go to the website, sodium1.com, I think it is,

697
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
and you actually put in your PlayStation ID and all this stuff,

698
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
it tracks your mini achievements.

699
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
I mean, they're not actual trophies,

700
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
but they're like achievements within sodium.

701
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
It tracks them on the website.

702
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,240
It tracks your high scores.

703
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,240
There's a Facebook app that you can use,

704
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,240
and, of course, it's just going to...

705
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,240
I enabled it, but I didn't enable it to publish it on my wall

706
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,240
because I knew every time I did something in the game,

707
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
all my friends would have to see it,

708
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,240
and I didn't want to burden people with that.

709
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,240
But, you know, it does have that connectivity.

710
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,240
I thought it was interesting that there's a giant screen

711
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,240
within the sodium stadium, or whatever they call it,

712
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
that has their Twitter feed on it.

713
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,240
I don't recall seeing that in home before.

714
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
Yeah, that'd be nice to have in my clubhouse, too.

715
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,240
Right?

716
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:13,240
If that's doable, can I have that in the OLR clubhouse, please?

717
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,240
I also thought it was interesting that you could,

718
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,240
you know, the points that you earn in the game

719
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,240
could go towards unlocking stuff in the home

720
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,240
that you could put, like, if you go to the OLR clubhouse now,

721
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,240
there's a new table, there's some new seats,

722
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,240
and a new little statue.

723
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
I got all that in the sodium one thing.

724
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,240
So, you know, I'm not saying that's really new,

725
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,240
because certainly there's a lot of other, you know,

726
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,240
areas within home that have done that,

727
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,240
but to see that kind of actually integrated with a game

728
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,240
was kind of neat.

729
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,240
And not just a game like how Namco Museum Essentials

730
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
was a game that would unlock stuff in home,

731
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,240
but the game was actually in home,

732
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,240
and that that all worked together very seamlessly.

733
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,240
It kind of made me go, huh,

734
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,240
this really feels like what home was advertised as

735
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,240
a year and a half ago.

736
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,240
Games and social interaction working seamlessly together.

737
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,240
It's just a bummer that I feel like the game I'm playing here

738
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,240
I played back in 1996 on a modem on my PC,

739
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
but, okay, it's a step forward.

740
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,240
You know what I mean?

741
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,240
They were, it was a neat game, but it's just like,

742
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,240
I don't know.

743
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,240
And to be fair, maybe I didn't see enough

744
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,240
in the first few levels that you're able to play.

745
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,240
I was just talking about it, just like it's like this

746
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,240
really revolutionary thing, and I just didn't see it.

747
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,240
I was like, oh great, it's another space in home.

748
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,240
Awesome.

749
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,240
Well, because I think for home, it is doing something new.

750
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,240
For the concept of home, I mean,

751
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,240
we still don't have our trophy room with our trophies in it,

752
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,240
so what else do we have to look forward to in home?

753
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,240
Oh, the game integration and the way that it's going to

754
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
integrate with the rest of the PlayStation brand.

755
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,240
So I see this as a step forward.

756
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,240
It's not a big step forward, but it was neat.

757
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,240
I was entertained for an hour.

758
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,240
For free.

759
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,240
I did get the walk around still as my creepy Santa Claus,

760
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,240
which this time of year is very relevant.

761
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,240
You know, dressed like a Santa Claus.

762
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,240
One of the dollies just passed out from excitement,

763
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,240
apparently, over the snooze.

764
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,240
Ooh, crazy.

765
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,240
I just don't have a very stable place to put her.

766
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,240
Sorry.

767
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,240
But anyhow, I don't know.

768
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,240
I'm curious to see where this leads in 2010.

769
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,240
I don't know.

770
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,240
Some folks in chat are asking about the OLR Clubhouse.

771
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Yes, on Sony Home, we have an OLR Clubhouse.

772
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,240
It might be full.

773
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,240
I think we have 25 members in it now.

774
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,240
I haven't been joined yet, and it's full already.

775
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,240
Is it?

776
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,240
Have you tried?

777
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
I don't know.

778
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,240
Try to send a request to the Orange Lounge Radio.

779
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,240
It's in there if you search for it.

780
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,240
Honestly, I think you type OLRME is like the keyword,

781
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,240
O-L-R-M-Y, and it'll come up.

782
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,240
And you should be able to join it.

783
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,240
And they're saying in chat, make another if it's full.

784
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,240
Dude, I already had to pay for the first one.

785
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,240
And here's my deal.

786
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,240
I will gladly build five clubhouses

787
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,240
if they give me something to do in this clubhouse

788
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,240
that's really unique.

789
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
You know what I mean?

790
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,240
Let me do the Twitter feed on the TV.

791
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
Let me put a custom video.

792
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,240
Let me put down a radio that will play MP3s from this program.

793
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,240
You know, that'll play the rant from earlier tonight

794
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,240
or something.

795
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,240
You know, let me do something with home

796
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,240
other than just have a space to chat in

797
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,240
because that's what the rest of home is, you know?

798
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,240
Exactly.

799
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,240
Deathwishing is saying request.

800
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,240
So I thought I approved all the pending requests.

801
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,240
So I will go in tonight and make sure it's all approved.

802
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,240
But if it's full, I don't know what to tell you.

803
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,240
You might be screwed.

804
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,240
I'm sorry.

805
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
But at least you'll have this to look forward to.

806
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,240
Something on PBS.

807
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,240
That's right, PBS, the Public Broadcast System.

808
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
Most popularly known maybe for the Lawrence Welk show.

809
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,240
I don't know.

810
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,240
Reading Rainbow, Rob.

811
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,240
Of course.

812
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,240
Sesame Street.

813
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,240
Doctor Who.

814
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,240
That's right.

815
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
Early Doctor Who.

816
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,240
And a lot of great British imports.

817
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,240
Obviously, okay.

818
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,240
The Red Dwarf.

819
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,240
The Public Broadcasting System.

820
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,240
All kidding aside, you know the types of stuff

821
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,240
they show on here.

822
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,240
Masterpiece Theater.

823
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,240
And a lot of times, a lot of orchestral concerts

824
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,240
and a lot of like, you know, things you would see

825
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,240
at like an opera house and so forth.

826
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,240
So it might surprise you to know that PBS

827
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,240
is planning to record and air video games live in 2010.

828
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
That's right.

829
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,240
The thing that was kind of meant to bridge that gap

830
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,240
between the video game community and A Night at the Opera,

831
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,240
although, you know, in talking to Tommy Tallarico,

832
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,240
the brains behind this before,

833
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
I don't think he wants people to think video game live

834
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,240
is A Night at the Opera because it's not.

835
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,240
But it definitely kind of, it's an interesting evolution

836
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,240
of that, I suppose you could say, for a new generation.

837
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,240
They're actually going to do this live performance

838
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,240
on February 5th in New Orleans at the Lakefront Arena

839
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,240
and on February 5th of 2010, they're gonna tape this.

840
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,240
You can get tickets now through Ticketmaster.

841
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,240
And it's actually going to air sometime in June.

842
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,240
And apparently also a DVD and Blu-ray

843
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,240
because PBS puts out a lot of their programming

844
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,240
on DVD, Blu-ray to kind of raise money for the stations

845
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,240
because, you know, they're all publicly funded and so forth.

846
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,240
So, you know, sales from those will go to help fund PBS.

847
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
So that's kind of cool for those that were looking to,

848
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
you know, especially if you live in a place

849
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,240
that doesn't get video games live coming there,

850
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,240
although they've gone to a lot of places,

851
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,240
you'll have an opportunity to see the show.

852
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
So that's pretty cool.

853
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,240
If you're going to dress, though, dress to impress

854
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,240
because you might be on TV.

855
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,240
Just something to think about.

856
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,240
Yeah, Tiger Conchat says, that would be cool.

857
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,240
I get PBS and HD.

858
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,240
That's true, you know, considering we're talking Blu-ray

859
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,240
and PBS, PBS was like the first channel

860
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,240
I remember seeing going HD.

861
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,240
I think PBS was in HD long before NBC

862
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,240
and the other folks got on board.

863
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,240
So it's going to look good.

864
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,240
It's going to look good.

865
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,240
You'll get to see all of Tommy's outfit changes

866
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,240
in high definition.

867
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,240
It'll be quite impressive.

868
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,240
But if that doesn't interest you,

869
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,240
maybe Dark Sakura has something that will.

870
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:52,240
Well, you know, we covered the Alien vs. Predator

871
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
not being approved in Australia

872
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,240
and Sega actually appealed it and won.

873
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,240
So it looks like Alien vs. Predator

874
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,240
is going to be released in Australia

875
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,240
with an MA15 Plus title,

876
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,240
which is pretty much the goal they had anyway

877
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,240
because from this quote it says,

878
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,240
It is for adults.

879
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,240
It is bloody and frightening.

880
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
That was our intent.

881
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:20,240
So basically they're saying that they're going to leave it

882
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,240
to the reasonable expectations of adults to,

883
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,240
you know, whether or not they want to get the game or not.

884
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,240
I seem to remember talking about this in a previous episode

885
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,240
and the fact that the makers behind that game

886
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,240
are very cold and unwilling to budge on this

887
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,240
is that we made this game and we are not changing it

888
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,240
and if you are not a responsible enough adult to play it,

889
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
then don't play it.

890
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:45,240
But we're not changing it because you can't handle it.

891
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,240
I have to admire it.

892
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,240
They might go down in flames,

893
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,240
but I have to admire them not wanting to budge.

894
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,240
Stick to them guns and maintain some integrity.

895
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,240
Gold star for all of you kids.

896
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,240
No selling out.

897
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,240
Do you think other places have sold out, Rob?

898
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,240
Like other game companies?

899
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,240
Yeah.

900
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,240
One could claim that Valve and so forth sold out

901
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,240
when they made those changes to get the game released

902
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
in Australia and so forth.

903
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,240
Well, hold on, let me say this and then I'll go on the tangent.

904
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,240
I don't know if that was so much selling out as it was

905
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,240
they did what they had to do to release the game.

906
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,240
People in movies do this all the time.

907
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,240
I mean, if you think these guys are bad in the other countries,

908
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,240
look at what they do right here in America

909
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,240
with the Motion Picture Association.

910
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,240
No, no.

911
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,240
Heaven forbid you show a vagina or a penis in your movie

912
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,240
or you're going to get smacked with an NC-17 rating

913
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,240
and no theater house in America is going to show your movie.

914
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
Life of Brian does not have an NC-17 rating

915
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,240
and it's got full frontal.

916
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,240
But it's also a lot older, I think,

917
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,240
when movies were fitting into the X category

918
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,240
or it might have still been R.

919
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,240
I don't think that it was R.

920
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,240
For some reason in the 70s, like Porky's and a lot of these movies

921
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,240
somehow got under the radar.

922
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,240
But you know, in this day and age, let's face it,

923
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,240
a movie like Showgirls got a rating like NC-17

924
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,240
not because it was bad but because it had a lot of tits and ass.

925
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,240
But heaven forbid they show tits and ass in a movie

926
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,240
but it's okay to show, you know, torture porn.

927
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,240
Movies like Hostel and Saw and all these movies are A-okay.

928
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,240
They play them at the multiplexes across America.

929
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,240
I mean, it's the same thing.

930
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,240
So if you think this type of sensor and directors and so forth

931
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,240
change their movies all the time to get down to the R rating

932
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,240
because they know if they release it with an NC-17 rating,

933
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,240
they're screwed. They'll never make the money back on the movie.

934
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,240
The studios force them to do it.

935
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,240
They are contractually obliged to deliver a certain rating.

936
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,240
Once in a while you get those indie studios.

937
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
They're like, if you are releasing our unrated movie,

938
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,240
you know, once in a while you see those slip through the cracks

939
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,240
but unfortunately they don't make money.

940
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,240
Or you get the unrated version for a home release.

941
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,240
Yeah.

942
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,240
And some folks in chat are saying X movie has Full Frontal

943
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,240
and Y movie has Full Frontal.

944
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,240
Okay, yeah. Okay, fine.

945
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,240
You know, you can show a little peen and a little vag and get away with it

946
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,240
but, you know, usually you have to appeal it to get the rating

947
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,240
and let's face it, you and I, you the listener and I,

948
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:18,240
the hosts can agree that the standards between violence and nudity

949
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,240
are way different. Come on.

950
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,240
You can't show penetration in a movie

951
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,240
but you can show a bullet going through someone's brain.

952
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,240
You can show that penetration.

953
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,240
Just saying.

954
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,240
What if you fired a penis instead of a bullet

955
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,240
and it penetrated instead of their head, a vagina?

956
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Would that still count if it's fired from a gun?

957
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,240
NC-17. A cum shot is always going to get you NC-17.

958
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,240
Always.

959
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,240
No way are they ever going to let that slide in an unrated movie

960
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,240
and I would cite two movies.

961
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,240
Happiness, which was released unreleased.

962
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,240
It's actually a really good movie.

963
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,240
It's by the guy who did Welcome to the Dollhouse.

964
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,240
It's pretty good.

965
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,240
That came out about 10, 12 years ago

966
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,240
and it got an NC-17 rating because

967
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,240
you don't actually see the cum shot.

968
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,240
You just see the cum hit in the wall

969
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,240
but because that's so hideously disgusting, you know,

970
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,240
and immoral, it got an NC-17 rating.

971
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,240
And then there was a movie that came out a couple years ago, Shortbus,

972
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,240
that was just full-on explicit sex in the movie.

973
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,240
It was great.

974
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,240
But the cool thing, it was by the guy who did Headwig and the Angry Inch.

975
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,240
And the interesting thing about it is that he set out to make a movie.

976
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,240
His goal was to make a movie with porn in it

977
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,240
that was not about the sex.

978
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,240
And I have to say, he made a pretty damn good movie.

979
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,240
I wouldn't say you should see it if you're under 17,

980
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,240
but if you are of age, I think it's a fine movie.

981
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,240
I really liked that movie.

982
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,240
I thought it was a great movie too.

983
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,240
I liked The Lady and it was in Hedwig.

984
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
SalaciousPopInChat brings up a good point.

985
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,240
They did that in Scary Movie 2, Dick in the Head.

986
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,240
I forgot about that.

987
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,240
That is true. You didn't see Balls though.

988
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,240
Maybe it's not penis people have a problem with.

989
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,240
It's balls.

990
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,240
It's just like breasts.

991
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,240
You know, the breast is okay, but the nipple, oh my god, no.

992
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,240
Alright.

993
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,240
Anyhow, let's move around the country and cover some release dates.

994
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,240
Things that are okay.

995
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,240
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot a tangent.

996
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,240
And one of our folks that works for Orange Andrea

997
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,240
would want me to say something about this on air.

998
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,240
Dekeman, because he posted this to the Twitter earlier this week.

999
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,240
Did you hear about the Australian censorship

1000
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,240
and the fact that they are looking at,

1001
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,240
and I don't know if this is somebody running with us,

1002
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,240
they are looking at installing basically China-like restrictions on their internet

1003
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,240
and filtering out objectionable sites.

1004
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
Quote,

1005
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,240
This is really going to hurt your tough man edge, Australia.

1006
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,240
I mean, seriously, it was all about crocodile hunters

1007
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,240
and beer drinking and kangaroos over there.

1008
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,240
That's not an internet.

1009
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,240
And, and, don't forget the transvestites.

1010
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,240
But now it's just like, you know, censored internet.

1011
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,240
I hope that just got misconstrued.

1012
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,240
I really hope.

1013
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,240
And Dekeman posted it to our Twitter.

1014
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,240
It was a little disheartening.

1015
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,240
I think that any type of censorship is, you know,

1016
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,240
the only people who I think should be allowed to censor

1017
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,240
are parents and people censoring themselves.

1018
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,240
But if I'm not mistaking, Australia has a parliament-style government,

1019
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,240
which means they do have elected officials.

1020
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,240
So, Australians, if you're listening and you disagree with this,

1021
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,240
vote your politicians the fuck out of office immediately.

1022
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,240
Unless, of course, they were the politicians that were against this.

1023
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,240
But I believe in your country.

1024
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,240
You do vote, and you vote these people the fuck out

1025
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,240
that are trying to do this.

1026
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,240
Anyhow, let's move on to happier topics.

1027
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,240
A lot of angst tonight.

1028
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,240
I swear, I'm actually in a really good mood, all things considered.

1029
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,240
Life is pretty good right now.

1030
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,240
I can't complain.

1031
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,240
So I don't know why we're having such an angsty show tonight.

1032
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,240
OLR, quit trying to bring me down.

1033
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,240
Alright, not much coming up this week in the US.

1034
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,240
Mainly three games.

1035
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,240
Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out on PlayStation 2.

1036
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,240
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

1037
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,240
That is, of course, if you didn't get it free with Guitar Hero 5

1038
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,240
during the month of September.

1039
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,240
Twin Sector being released on PC.

1040
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,240
And finally, on the Wii, we have Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles,

1041
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,240
The Crystal Bears, coming out on the Wii.

1042
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:24,240
The first real good Wii Final Fantasy game.

1043
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,240
That's the one that they've been advertising ever since the damn thing launched, right?

1044
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,240
Yep, that would be the one.

1045
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,240
Well, moving over to Japan, honestly, it's pretty dried up over there, too.

1046
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,240
I mean, you've got your Final Fantasy XIII now,

1047
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,240
which I have seen trophies popping up on my Facebook friend feed,

1048
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,240
so I know I have friends that imported this stuff, and they're playing away on it.

1049
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
Not one of them.

1050
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,240
So now things are dying down a little bit there,

1051
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,240
but that's not to say there's nothing coming out.

1052
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,240
I mean, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360 is getting a price reduction this week in Japan,

1053
01:00:53,240 --> 01:01:00,240
as well as Infernal, Hell's Vengeance is a new game coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.

1054
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,240
On the PlayStation 3, it sounds like a new Hori arcade stick is coming out,

1055
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,240
but that is really it.

1056
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,240
There's no new releases on the particular system,

1057
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,240
which, considering the games usually come out Friday over there,

1058
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:15,240
and Friday is Christmas Eve, not going to really see a whole lot, probably.

1059
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,240
Nintendo Wii, same story.

1060
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,240
Going over to the PlayStation 2,

1061
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,240
there is a Neo Geo Online Collection Complete Box, Volumes 1 and 2.

1062
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,240
That is something new coming out over there,

1063
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,240
but really that's just rehashed old stuff.

1064
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:35,240
And on the Nintendo DS, Zelda no Densetsu Taoyu no Kiteki.

1065
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,240
Anyone want to guess what that is on the Nintendo DS?

1066
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,240
I would say The Train Game.

1067
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,240
It is The Train Game.

1068
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,240
Gets its release this week in Japan,

1069
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,240
so that is probably the big release in Japan this week.

1070
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,240
Quickly looking on the PSP,

1071
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,240
there are actually a few things you might care about on the PSP.

1072
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,240
Assassin's Creed Bloodlines in Japan this week,

1073
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,240
Lucky Star Net Idle Meister,

1074
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,240
and Metal Slug XX all make its way to the PSP.

1075
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,240
So, funny enough,

1076
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,240
the system that seems to be having the biggest week is the PSP.

1077
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,240
Go, Fig.

1078
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,240
There you go.

1079
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,240
Some stupid candle won't light.

1080
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,240
Oops, and I got my days mixed up.

1081
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,240
Tiger Class says Thursday is Christmas Eve,

1082
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,240
actually Friday is Christmas Day, so, sorry.

1083
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,240
Eh, who keeps up with Christmas anymore?

1084
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,240
The releases are getting all messed up because of the holidays, anyway.

1085
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,240
So.

1086
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,240
Well, it's pretty much dry in the UK.

1087
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,240
Just one game on the 22nd.

1088
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
Well, one game came out today,

1089
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,240
Nicky Rock and Ball.

1090
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Well, I should say Yesterday now for them,

1091
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,240
because it's the 20th already.

1092
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,240
On the 22nd is Savage Moon The Hera Campaign on PSP.

1093
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,240
That's about it.

1094
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,240
Couple more news stories for you guys,

1095
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,240
and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week

1096
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,240
here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1097
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,240
It looks like it's going to be a good one tonight.

1098
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,240
I peeked at what DarkSakura picked,

1099
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,240
and it's one that I wholeheartedly endorse.

1100
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,240
Speaking about Final Fantasy XIII,

1101
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,240
it did pretty well this week,

1102
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:02,240
including 1 million copies sold within,

1103
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,240
I believe, the first 24 hours, yes.

1104
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,240
Wow.

1105
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,240
Over 2 million copies sold.

1106
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,240
I know they shipped 2 million,

1107
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,240
so probably between 1 and 2 million copies sold.

1108
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:17,240
Of course, that includes the Lightning Edition PS3

1109
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:24,240
with the silkscreen pink, I guess, portrait of lightning.

1110
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,240
Yeah, we still have to wait a few months.

1111
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,240
So it's basically the equivalent of a Modern Warfare 2 here,

1112
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,240
which sold what?

1113
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,240
Didn't they say it sold like 7 million in the first week,

1114
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,240
or some huge amount?

1115
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,240
A Halo 3 sold millions.

1116
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,240
This is kind of the equivalent over there.

1117
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,240
Heck yeah.

1118
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,240
Which surprises probably no one.

1119
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,240
But the real question is,

1120
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,240
what will happen when the game comes out here?

1121
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,240
Will it move a million in one night here?

1122
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,240
I don't think it will.

1123
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,240
It'll move a million overall,

1124
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,240
but it won't move a million in the first night.

1125
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,240
Oh yeah, it will.

1126
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,240
No way.

1127
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,240
I hope I'm wrong.

1128
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,240
We'll see.

1129
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,240
Anyhow, one other thing.

1130
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,240
And this is something actually new that directly affects me,

1131
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,240
because I participated in it this week.

1132
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,240
Squeenix is now accepting beta applications for Final Fantasy XIV.

1133
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,240
So if you're skipping Final Fantasy XIII,

1134
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,240
maybe you are looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.

1135
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,240
That's right.

1136
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,240
The applications are now open for the Final Fantasy XIV beta.

1137
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,240
Please note, this is only the Windows edition.

1138
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,240
They're not doing, it looks like,

1139
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,240
what they did on the PlayStation 2 for Final Fantasy XI,

1140
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,240
where they actually were shipping hard drives to people

1141
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,240
to beta test that,

1142
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,240
and they could keep them as a thank you gift.

1143
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,240
That's not the case here.

1144
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,240
You will have to sign up for only the Windows version,

1145
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,240
at least for right now.

1146
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,240
They are doing the PS3 version as well,

1147
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,240
but you can sign up for it, but it's not now.

1148
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,240
Maybe I'll sign up for the beta.

1149
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,240
You know, might as well.

1150
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,240
Sign up for it, and then if I don't get in, I'll take yours.

1151
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,240
How's that?

1152
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,240
I already had one friend do that for me.

1153
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,240
I'm trying to find friends to sign up.

1154
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,240
I'm like, if you get in and I don't, I want it.

1155
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,240
But anyhow...

1156
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,240
I just don't know if I'm...

1157
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,240
Honestly, I hardly have time to play World of Warcraft,

1158
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,240
and Star Trek Online's coming out.

1159
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,240
I know, I'm in the same boat, but like, seriously,

1160
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,240
I will push World of Warcraft to the side for a little while

1161
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,240
to focus on this, if it's good.

1162
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,240
If they've learned from their mistakes from XI,

1163
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,240
which I still think XI was a solid game for its time,

1164
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,240
it just didn't age well.

1165
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,240
You know, I think if they really have kind of combined

1166
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,240
the best parts of that with the best parts of World of Warcraft,

1167
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,240
this game could be pretty awesome.

1168
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,240
So I want to check it out.

1169
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,240
Anyhow, though, just so you know,

1170
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,240
you need to be 18 years old in order to apply.

1171
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,240
You have to be fluent in English,

1172
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,240
which, if you're listening to this show, I'm assuming you are.

1173
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,240
Or you could be fluent in Japanese, French, or German,

1174
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,240
because I know we do have some listeners in Japan

1175
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,240
and even some of those other countries there.

1176
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,240
And apparently, though, a PS3 one will come out later.

1177
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,240
It's just that right now you can only sign up for the PC version.

1178
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,240
Also, no MMORPG experience required,

1179
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,240
but I will tell you, since I did sign up,

1180
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,240
I was prepared to fill out a little bit of a questionnaire

1181
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,240
about your gaming experience,

1182
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:09,240
which is translated from a Japanese version, you can kind of tell.

1183
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,240
But yeah, let us know.

1184
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,240
If any of you OLR people get in, let me know so I can be jealous,

1185
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,240
especially if I don't get in.

1186
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,240
This would use my Play Online ID, right?

1187
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,240
No, it doesn't. I think they're going away from Play Online.

1188
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,240
It's a whole new login.

1189
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,240
I tried my Play Online ID and it didn't work.

1190
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,240
Anyhow, moving on, and something you don't need Play Online for

1191
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,240
is to access the Classic Game of the Week.

1192
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,240
That's right, every week here on the show,

1193
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,240
DarkSakura takes a walk through gaming's history

1194
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,240
by stepping into the vault and picking a classic game that she says,

1195
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,240
You know what, darn it?

1196
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,240
You guys ought to be playing this game.

1197
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,240
DarkSakura, what did you pick for the game this week?

1198
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,240
Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.

1199
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,240
Great pick. I'll have the music here shortly.

1200
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,240
Firefox had to reboot, so I'll get the music here in a moment.

1201
01:06:54,240 --> 01:07:00,240
Fun. Well, the game originally came out in Japan in 1987

1202
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:08,240
for the Famicon Disk System, as did the third one, too.

1203
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:14,240
It came out in the US in cartridge form in 1988.

1204
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:21,240
It's a little bit of a different game than the first one.

1205
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,240
It has some RPG elements you can go and of course talk to the townsfolk

1206
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,240
and then have what a horrible night for a curse

1207
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:35,240
when you go and jump in on the zombies

1208
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:40,240
and things that wander around the countryside when nightfall hits, apparently.

1209
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:47,240
You do have to buy items, which you'll need to get to different areas.

1210
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,240
You have to get hearts.

1211
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,240
And you can also buy new whips as you keep going on.

1212
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,240
You have an experience rating system,

1213
01:07:55,240 --> 01:08:00,240
so your experience rating increases, of course, as you collect hearts.

1214
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,240
And that's actually something that made it into Dracula X.

1215
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:07,240
Not Dracula X, but Symphony of the Night, if you'll remember.

1216
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,240
And as you can probably hear there a little bit of, I did get the music to come up.

1217
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,240
So, of course, Castlevania II, who did not love the music in this game?

1218
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,240
Now we have some of the music playing in the background.

1219
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,240
That's right.

1220
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:32,240
But anyway, I'll listen to it for a little bit.

1221
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,240
Easily one of the ten best songs ever in a video game. Easily.

1222
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,240
Yeah.

1223
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:42,240
Anyway, the whole point of the game is that you have to go to different mansions

1224
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,240
to find different parts of Dracula's corpse and then the magic cross.

1225
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:53,240
So, you can actually use the different body parts as power-ups, kind of.

1226
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,240
Like the rib bone is a shield.

1227
01:08:55,240 --> 01:09:03,240
And then, once you get everything, you can clear the blockade to Dracula's castle and fight.

1228
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,240
So, yeah.

1229
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:11,240
It was directed by Akamatsu, who also did Castlevania III.

1230
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:21,240
And it had a password system for the US version as opposed to the save system that the Famicom Disk System had.

1231
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,240
You know, like, side bike? Hello.

1232
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:33,240
There's also some pretty crazy English in the game, like naming Simon Simon, like with two M's.

1233
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:43,240
And there's, you know, of course, the music in it was done by Matsubara Kenichi,

1234
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:49,240
who did the Castlevania Arcade, the Haunted Castle.

1235
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:56,240
And they also used some of that for Simon's Quest.

1236
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:06,240
It also has the different parts of the game, you know, the statues and things, crying blood.

1237
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:10,240
So, lots of cool stuff going on.

1238
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:16,240
Also, it actually, the game caused some controversy in the US with Nintendo Power.

1239
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:22,240
It was the second issue of Nintendo Power that had the Simon's Quest cover,

1240
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:26,240
and it was also in Howard and Nestor, if you remember Howard and Nestor.

1241
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:32,240
But the cover apparently scared children.

1242
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,240
So, caused a little problem.

1243
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,240
I got in trouble in grade school over this magazine.

1244
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,240
And it had nothing to do with the cover, actually.

1245
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,240
It's just that I brought it to school one day and I was trying to show a friend of mine during class.

1246
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,240
The teacher was pissed at me.

1247
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,240
But I was so excited, because it was Castlevania II and it was awesome.

1248
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,240
Yep.

1249
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:58,240
Also, with this particular one, it was actually the first in the series that got away from linear gameplay

1250
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,240
and inspired, actually, Symphony of the Night.

1251
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:05,240
Not necessarily Metroid-inspired, Rob.

1252
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,240
And...

1253
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:11,240
Debatable, but okay.

1254
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:18,240
Certainly this game was so different from the first Castlevania that you already kind of started splitting up the series in a way at this point.

1255
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:28,240
But, I just have to say real quick, it was very interesting in the 8-bit era how deviant sequels were of the original.

1256
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:32,240
Like, you think about Super Mario Bros. 2, way different than the first one.

1257
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,240
Super Mario Bros. 2 was a different game.

1258
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:40,240
I know, I know, but still, our perception of it as kids, you know, not knowing this whole Japanese stuff, was way different here.

1259
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,240
You know, Castlevania II was really different.

1260
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,240
Mega Man 2 was kind of different.

1261
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,240
You know, a lot of sequels in the 8-bit era were really different than the original game.

1262
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,240
I can't say that Mega Man 2 was at all different.

1263
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:59,240
Each of the Mega Man games on the, um, the NES just kept adding different things and changing different, but they all pretty much kept the same formula.

1264
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,240
Even the X series kept the same formula.

1265
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:13,240
I can't really say that those weren't too different, but this, in this case, this one is a fairly big departure from how the first one went.

1266
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:21,240
But then what was also particularly weird about this, and Super Mario Bros., I guess you could say, is that they both went kind of back to the formula of the original in the third game.

1267
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:26,240
Although, Super Mario debatable, but Castlevania definitely went back to kind of the formula of the first game.

1268
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:31,240
Keep in mind, Super Mario 2 in Japan was what we got as, um, the lost levels.

1269
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,240
Sure, sure.

1270
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,240
And it was, just like the first one, only harder.

1271
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,240
Right.

1272
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,240
And it had the, um, the poison mushrooms and stuff.

1273
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:47,240
So, yeah, I think Mario, actually, if you look at it with the actual successors to the original, that one kept the same formula, too.

1274
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,240
But, um...

1275
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:54,240
Okay, I have to say real quick from chat, because this is a really good point, Black Wolf, our good pal Bobby Black Wolf says,

1276
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,240
The platformer in Retro Game Challenge was different in all three versions.

1277
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,240
Even in that game, they made the sequel so different.

1278
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,240
That's kind of like an inside joke.

1279
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:08,240
Well, at any rate, um, something that might be interesting to other people, this is from an interview in 2002,

1280
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:13,240
is Igarashi Koji, who is, like, one of my video game heroes and who I got a hug from.

1281
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,240
I'm so happy.

1282
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:27,240
Um, actually, uh, was talking about considering a compilation of the NES titles for, um, for, uh, I suppose, um, either Game Boy or PC, so...

1283
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:32,240
Well, I seem to recall there was an 8-bit collection that came out that had the...

1284
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,240
Yeah, there was. This was actually in response to the compilation.

1285
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,240
Gotcha.

1286
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,240
So, but anyway, this is a cool game.

1287
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:44,240
Very, very good pick tonight. Uh, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, one of my absolute favorite 8-bit games that ever existed.

1288
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,240
I love this music right here.

1289
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,240
That's the very first song you hear when you press start.

1290
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,240
This isn't Bloody Tears.

1291
01:13:54,240 --> 01:14:00,240
If nothing else, just, like, one of the best music game soundtracks you'll ever hear.

1292
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,240
You know, I do have to say there is a Castlevania game that has a better soundtrack.

1293
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,240
Hmm.

1294
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,240
But in my opinion, it's Dracula X.

1295
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:13,240
Not just because it was Redbook Audio, because I actually like the process, the music on the SNES version better in some cases.

1296
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,240
Mm-hmm.

1297
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:17,240
But it did have some fantastic mixes of the songs.

1298
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:25,240
So, but I'd have to put this up there, at least as far as the, the SNES titles go. That one's probably got my favorite music in it.

1299
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:33,240
Interesting. Our other pal, Bress Lowell in chat, who, uh, of course is a co-host on Understation Live, says, uh, Simon's Quest is actually my least favorite Castlevania game.

1300
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:37,240
Now, if you want to see something really funny about Simon's Quest, just look for the Angry Nintendo Nerd.

1301
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,240
Yeah.

1302
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,240
His version, his description of it was fantastic.

1303
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:51,240
Um, I have to say my least favorite Castlevania game, and I, I know this is one of your favorites, Jamie, but Castlevania V on the SNES was ruined for me.

1304
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,240
Five?

1305
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:56,240
Just, it was, well, right? Because it was, it was supposed to be the port of Dracula.

1306
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,240
It was, it came out as Dracula X.

1307
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,240
Didn't they call it Dracula V?

1308
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,240
No, they called it Dracula X.

1309
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,240
I thought, I thought in a magazine it was like Castlevania V.

1310
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,240
I've got the box, it says Dracula X.

1311
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:09,240
Alright. But I, I just thought at some point I remember referring to it as Castlevania V, but it, well.

1312
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,240
Because it did come out after Super Castlevania IV.

1313
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,240
Right. But it was so...

1314
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:20,240
Yeah, no, it was, it was really, I would have to say neutered.

1315
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,240
It was, it was a castrated version of Dracula X.

1316
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,240
Rob, you're gonna have to come over some night and just play through Dracula X with me.

1317
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,240
It'll be fun.

1318
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,240
On the, um, the NeoGeo. We'll have to put, we'll have to put a feet up.

1319
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,240
Rob, Rob playing as Maria.

1320
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,240
La la la, la la la la.

1321
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,240
One of her attacks is singing.

1322
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,240
Nice.

1323
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,240
She sings badly that it kills, like, everything around her, and her little singing is la la la la la la.

1324
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,240
Like that.

1325
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:49,240
Uh, also you're forgetting, uh, I think Bresloul might be neglecting Castlevania Judgment.

1326
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,240
Huh? What? Who?

1327
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,240
The fighting game on Wii?

1328
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,240
What? I, I don't, what?

1329
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,240
Oh, I see. That doesn't exist in your universe. I see.

1330
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,240
Maybe Castlevania 64?

1331
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:03,240
Oh, snap! That's right! Bresloul! Castlevania 64. I think Loki wins.

1332
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,240
That was pretty bad.

1333
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,240
That was definitely a low point in the Castlevania series.

1334
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,240
Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.

1335
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:15,240
We're going to take a quick break, though, and we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so please stay tuned.

1336
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,240
We will be right back.

1337
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:28,240
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, where we are live with our 349th episode of the show.

1338
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:32,240
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

1339
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:40,240
www.allgames.com, and thanks to the folks there that help let us take over the stream and do our little show every Sunday night.

1340
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,240
We really appreciate it.

1341
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:47,240
So before we get back into some gaming news tonight, we've had some rants and stuff, and I got angry earlier in the show,

1342
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:50,240
but obviously I saved this for later in the show.

1343
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,240
It turns out I might be wrong. I might have been wrong.

1344
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:58,240
And I don't like to admit when I'm wrong, but apparently I was wrong.

1345
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,240
And it has to do with Avatar, that movie that came out.

1346
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,240
I was coming out here saying, oh, this movie's probably going to bomb.

1347
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,240
No one's going to fucking care about Avatar.

1348
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,240
Well, it was a 70-something million at the box office.

1349
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,240
I haven't heard a negative thing about it.

1350
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:16,240
I've heard that the plot is kind of meh, but that this movie is still amazing.

1351
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,240
I have seen lots of people on Facebook, on my friends list.

1352
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:24,240
I don't really trust critics, but I trust my friends that say, OMG, best movie ever.

1353
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,240
Or, OMG, what a great movie.

1354
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,240
So now I'm kind of sitting here going, damn, I might have to go see it.

1355
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:32,240
There's just a lot of people saying such great things about it.

1356
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,240
Loki, did you go?

1357
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,240
I did. I saw it in 3D.

1358
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,240
And?

1359
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,240
It was awesome.

1360
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,240
Was it really?

1361
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,240
It was good. It wasn't.

1362
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:43,240
If you're looking for an absolutely original plot, you're not going to get it with this.

1363
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:47,240
You can see stuff coming before it happens and stuff like that.

1364
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,240
But it was beautiful.

1365
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:53,240
As far as looking at the movie from a CG standpoint,

1366
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,240
a lot of the stuff was really seamless.

1367
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:02,240
The environments and everything completely rendered, so it looks absolutely gorgeous.

1368
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,240
And the 3D was awesome in it.

1369
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:10,240
It wasn't really just no gimmicky stuff where stuff's flying at your face and that kind of stuff.

1370
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,240
This is even better.

1371
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,240
I went to the new theaters that opened up in Folsom.

1372
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:21,240
This Paladio, I've never heard of this brand, but Cinema West.

1373
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:27,240
Other than having a really annoying little pre-show advertisement thing,

1374
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:32,240
because they have before the movies and they have this really creepy looking rapist bee.

1375
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,240
Did you say a rapist bee?

1376
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:38,240
Yeah, he looks like he could be a pedophile or a rapist.

1377
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,240
So they kept playing those advertisements.

1378
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,240
We hated the bee after about a minute.

1379
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:48,240
But they have the greatest innovations in cinema in that theater.

1380
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:54,240
Other than the fact that they're advertising that it's the largest solar-powered cinema in the world,

1381
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,240
and the fact that it's all digital screens,

1382
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:01,240
they have gone innovative in an area that I never thought possible.

1383
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,240
They installed a toilet seat in the seat.

1384
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,240
No, no, no, no. Even better.

1385
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,240
Okay.

1386
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,240
Push a button, get beer.

1387
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,240
No, no, no, no. Even better.

1388
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:13,240
So I bought my popcorn and drink at the concession stand,

1389
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:17,240
and I'm eating the popcorn and I'm like, man, this is really kind of dry.

1390
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,240
There's not a lot of butter on this.

1391
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,240
You know, what the hell?

1392
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,240
I'm like, this new theater kind of sucks.

1393
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,240
Walk over to get my salt.

1394
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,240
What is there?

1395
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,240
A butter pump.

1396
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,240
Yes, you can put as much fucking butter on this popcorn as you want.

1397
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:35,240
And not only that, they have the season, you know, the different season popcorn toppings

1398
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,240
that normally at the UA would charge you to get a little container of it.

1399
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,240
All free.

1400
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,240
Unlimited butter on this thing.

1401
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,240
I was like, oh my god, this is the greatest theater ever.

1402
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,240
Oh my god, all you can eat butter?

1403
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,240
Exactly.

1404
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:55,240
There's only one thing better than butter, Loki, and that's more butter.

1405
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,240
It's just the topping.

1406
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,240
I'm like, I don't know if I should push that button because I think, you know,

1407
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,240
I would assume that butter is coming out of there,

1408
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,240
but it could be like chocolate sauce or something like that.

1409
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:08,240
Usually it's like liquid magma that is kind of butter flavored.

1410
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,240
And so I pushed the button and butter popped out.

1411
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,240
I'm like, awesome.

1412
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,240
Push a button, get butter.

1413
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,240
Is that the directions?

1414
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,240
Like, you know how they have directions on how to wash your hands?

1415
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,240
Oh, there is no directions. It just said topping.

1416
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,240
It did not say butter topping. It just said topping.

1417
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,240
I'm like, well, this could be like anything.

1418
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:29,240
Yeah, there's some people in chat saying, this isn't news, Loki.

1419
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,240
My theater does that.

1420
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:34,240
Well, none of ours do, so it's news for me.

1421
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,240
Now, here's the ultimate question.

1422
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,240
Was there bacon seasoning?

1423
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:43,240
Not that I'm aware of, but, you know, steps, baby steps.

1424
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,240
I see. I see. It's a step in the right direction.

1425
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,240
Let's not bite off more than we can chew.

1426
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,240
And bacon salt's not that good. Trust me.

1427
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:55,240
You know, as cool of a concept as bacon salt is, it does not taste like bacon.

1428
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:00,240
All right. Anyhow, let's move on with some more topics tonight,

1429
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,240
some other news stories.

1430
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,240
I just had to say that about Avatar.

1431
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,240
You know, I can man up and admit when I was wrong,

1432
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,240
and I may have been wrong about Avatar.

1433
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,240
I can't say I was wrong about Avatar because I haven't seen it yet,

1434
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,240
but I may have been wrong about it.

1435
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,240
We'll see.

1436
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,240
It's pretty good. I'd go see it in the theater and in 3D.

1437
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,240
You have to see it in 3D.

1438
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,240
I will see it in 3D, I promise.

1439
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,240
But I also have to see Princess and the Frog,

1440
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,240
because I did get to meet Princess Tiana this weekend,

1441
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,240
and she's mighty fierce.

1442
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,240
And I heard some of the songs from Princess and the Frog

1443
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,240
in the little street show they do.

1444
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,240
I really want to see Princess and the Frog.

1445
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,240
So that's at the top of my list.

1446
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:41,240
And then maybe Avatar if my mom doesn't drag me to see Precious on Christmas,

1447
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,240
which is likely.

1448
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,240
How about some gaming news?

1449
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,240
Less movies, more games.

1450
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,240
Yes.

1451
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:51,240
So I guess we've got some rapid-fire news to go into here.

1452
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,240
Sure.

1453
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:58,240
Starting things off, Dead or Live is coming to the PSP,

1454
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,240
but not what you might think.

1455
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:04,240
Dead or Live Paradise, which is Dead or Live beach volleyball,

1456
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,240
minus the volleyball.

1457
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:10,240
So it's just Dead or Live giggling girls in bikinis jumping around

1458
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:15,240
watching their boobs move to music, the game.

1459
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,240
So that's awesome.

1460
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,240
Thank you, Tecmo.

1461
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:24,240
Why don't they just call it Boob Physics, the game?

1462
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,240
Because that would be offensive.

1463
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

1464
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:32,240
But yeah, so it'll be coming out spring 2010, and it's awesome.

1465
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,240
That's innovation right there.

1466
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,240
PSP 4000.

1467
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,240
No.

1468
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,240
That.

1469
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:42,240
Speaking of fake boobs, Playboy has done their annual girls of video games.

1470
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,240
Their 2010 spread.

1471
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:48,240
And this year they'll be featuring women from such games as God of War,

1472
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,240
Crimecraft, The Saboteur, Dante's Inferno, Mafia 2, and Heavy Rain,

1473
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:58,240
including some characters I don't know because I haven't played those games yet.

1474
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,240
Skylar St. Clair from The Saboteur.

1475
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:08,240
Madison Page, I guess the main character from Heavy Rain is new in there as well.

1476
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,240
So if you want to see some fake naked boobies, I guess,

1477
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:17,240
then pick up the January, February issue of Playboy.

1478
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,240
So now they're skipping months in Playboy.

1479
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,240
I mean, does it come down to that?

1480
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,240
Is it bi-monthly now?

1481
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,240
I don't know.

1482
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:31,240
And then finally, I still don't understand the idea of buying Playboy for video game rendered characters,

1483
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:35,240
but I suppose either way you buy the magazine, the girls are fake.

1484
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,240
So, hey, whatever.

1485
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,240
They have Tara Reid on the cover, but I bet you she's not topless, even though she's a slut.

1486
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,240
Oh, sorry.

1487
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:46,240
Would it be bad if I said, yeah, she is topless because I saw the pictures?

1488
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,240
Okay, well, awesome.

1489
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,240
But still, that's not like, I don't know.

1490
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,240
But I'm saying it's about as real as the video game magazine spread.

1491
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,240
I'm just saying.

1492
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,240
I'm just saying.

1493
01:23:55,240 --> 01:24:00,240
And finally, this Thursday, we're going to be getting some wonderful holiday treats as well.

1494
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:06,240
On the 22nd, not only will we be getting the download content for LittleBigPlanet,

1495
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,240
which is going to be all sorts of awesome,

1496
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,240
but we'll be getting the Gran Turismo 5 Time Trial Challenge.

1497
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:17,240
Of course, if you have a Japanese account, you can download that right now, and it's in English.

1498
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:23,240
Puzzlegeddon, which I think came out last week on the...

1499
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,240
The puzzle to destroy all puzzles.

1500
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,240
Puzzlegeddon.

1501
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,240
Puzzlegeddon.

1502
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,240
Let's see.

1503
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:39,240
Also, there will be, of course, Guitar Hero 5 songs, High Speed Soul by Nada Surf,

1504
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,240
Sister Jack by Spoon, Cut Your Hair by Pavement,

1505
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:48,240
and the Indie Rock Track Pack featuring all three of those as well.

1506
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:53,240
And then, of course, the download content, which is really the most important thing.

1507
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:58,240
The PlayStation 1 classic, though, this week is going to be Final Fantasy VIII, and that's pretty awesome.

1508
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,240
Woohoo!

1509
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,240
So, that'll be coming out on the 26th.

1510
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,240
Wait. Final Fantasy VIII?

1511
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,240
VIII.

1512
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,240
Never mind.

1513
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,240
Hey, it's not Final Fantasy IX.

1514
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,240
I thought they just skipped ahead to IX.

1515
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,240
No, no, no. Final Fantasy IX wasn't that...

1516
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,240
Dude, I thought we ignored that VIII happened.

1517
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,240
Listen, I liked VIII.

1518
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,240
I liked VIII.

1519
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,240
I'm just being dramatic.

1520
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,240
Except the last disc bored the crap out of me.

1521
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,240
VIII had a good story.

1522
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,240
Y'all know how I feel about the battle system.

1523
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,240
If you don't, I've ranted about it like 50 times in the history of this show.

1524
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,240
I got so tired of seeing mob bros.

1525
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:30,240
Seriously, I was like, they could not have come up with a better name for this stupid, ugly creature.

1526
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:37,240
And then, of course, some PSP minis, Hercules, Chariot Racing, and Spot the Differences is the other game.

1527
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:43,240
Wait. Hold on. Spot the Differences is...

1528
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,240
That's the name of the game. Spot the Differences.

1529
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,240
Do I even need to crack a joke here?

1530
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,240
I mean, the jokes write themselves.

1531
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:54,240
They can have the PSP-2000 and the PSP-Go and it's like, what, one's crap? No?

1532
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:58,240
Spot the Differences.

1533
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:03,240
That'd be awesome if we could make a game like that and just like completely obvious differences.

1534
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:09,240
Like, you know, one's a puppy, one's a Hiddenberg disaster, you know, some ridiculous stuff.

1535
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,240
That'd be sweet.

1536
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:18,240
Puppy's less violent, right? No?

1537
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:23,240
One's a picture of Brittany Murphy, one's a picture of Heath... Never mind, I better not go there.

1538
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,240
She's a chick.

1539
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:29,240
She didn't die from a drug overdose. Oh, wait. No, that's not probably it.

1540
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,240
Moving on.

1541
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:34,240
She was a joker.

1542
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,240
No?

1543
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,240
I found something else I was looking for.

1544
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,240
Oh, I thought you found the differences we were talking about.

1545
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:46,240
No, I found something for you, Rob, that I wanted you to play during break and you didn't so you have to play it after the show.

1546
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:48,240
Fine. I have to, huh?

1547
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,240
You have to.

1548
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,240
I have to? Is it your Cage Match pick?

1549
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,240
You know what, Rob? I will put it in Cage Match.

1550
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,240
Will you now?

1551
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:57,240
Just because. Even though what I put in Cage Match was hilarious, you can make...

1552
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,240
Okay, make my Cage Match thing the cookie.

1553
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,240
Alright. Well, fine.

1554
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,240
Okay.

1555
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,240
Alright.

1556
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,240
Actually, no, this is what I put for Cage Match is really damn funny.

1557
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,240
Cage Match should be a Brittany Murphy song.

1558
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,240
Death Wishing in Chat says that...

1559
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,240
Okay, I'm gonna say this right now. Go call Rob.

1560
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,240
Oh, no.

1561
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:18,240
I don't give a shit about Brittany Murphy or whoever the fuck she was.

1562
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,240
Don't care. I didn't know her.

1563
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:24,240
Sucks she's dead. Sucks for her family.

1564
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,240
I don't care. The end.

1565
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:29,240
Does Tara Reid sing any music?

1566
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,240
I'm gonna put her in there.

1567
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,240
I don't know. I don't know.

1568
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,240
Anyhow...

1569
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,240
It's like just suddenly the Hindenburg disaster...

1570
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:45,240
Wait, hold on, hold on. Can you spot the difference?

1571
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,240
Tonight's program...

1572
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,240
Hindenburg disaster.

1573
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,240
Can you spot the difference?

1574
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:57,240
Death Wishing might have found it in chat.

1575
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:01,240
It said, uh, pro tip, Hindenburg powered by puppies with cute kitten pilots.

1576
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,240
I want a picture of that.

1577
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,240
Alright, anyhow.

1578
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,240
Moving on.

1579
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,240
Can we get in some more, um...

1580
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,240
Last minute star. Not last minute star.

1581
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,240
See, I want the show to be over.

1582
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,240
Oh, Rob.

1583
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,240
Rapid fire topics.

1584
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,240
Hey, there's a game called Zero Day Attack in Earth.

1585
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,240
Coming to Xbox Live Marketplace on December 23rd.

1586
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,240
That's right, Martians invade the Earth, shoot them up, bang bang, blow up.

1587
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:30,240
Not the type of game that Square Enix is usually known for.

1588
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,240
But, here's the kicker about the game.

1589
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,240
It uses satellite photography.

1590
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:40,240
So if you want to blow up real things, have a blast.

1591
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:46,240
Just don't blow up certain historical objects that aren't funny.

1592
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,240
You know what I mean?

1593
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,240
Although, I do notice in this picture, I just happen to see the Eiffel Tower.

1594
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,240
And guns going pew pew pew.

1595
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:57,240
But I guess because it's Martians, it's okay.

1596
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,240
It's just a science fiction thing.

1597
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,240
But I'm just saying.

1598
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,240
This might be...

1599
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,240
I can just see horrific YouTubes coming of this game.

1600
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,240
That's all I'm saying.

1601
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,240
Horrific YouTubes even worse than the joke I told earlier.

1602
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,240
Uh, anyhow.

1603
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:16,240
And if you were offended by my earlier joke, I have to say to you,

1604
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,240
Excuse me, internet!

1605
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,240
That's right, that old catchphrase,

1606
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,240
Excuse me, princess coin from the Legend of Zelda cartoons,

1607
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:27,240
which used to run as the Friday special on the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.

1608
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:32,240
And if you're kind of younger, you probably don't remember this,

1609
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,240
unless you've kind of seen it in a nostalgia post or whatever.

1610
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,240
But I certainly remember this from when I was younger.

1611
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,240
I bet a lot of our listeners remember this.

1612
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,240
Because I think I was around like 10.

1613
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,240
So a lot of our listeners, you know, 5, 6, probably, or 10.

1614
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:45,240
Yeah, they would have the Zelda cartoon on Fridays.

1615
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:48,240
Because the rest of the week was Mario cartoons, but Friday was Zelda cartoons.

1616
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:51,240
Well, those came out on DVD a while back, and if you bought those,

1617
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,240
well, it sucks to be you because they're all free on Hulu now.

1618
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,240
So if you want to see these cartoons and what they're all about,

1619
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:00,240
if you just want to see the LOLs that is this,

1620
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:05,240
although I will say this, this was definitely a step above the Philips CDI cutscenes.

1621
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,240
Those were just... wow.

1622
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,240
It's like I drew in paint.

1623
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,240
I know.

1624
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,240
Those were wow.

1625
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:18,240
Those are not available on Hulu, but the Zelda stuff is now on Hulu,

1626
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,240
if you want to relive your youth or have another youth.

1627
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,240
I don't know.

1628
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:28,240
Anyhow, also in tonight's rapid-fire news,

1629
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:35,240
apparently Tex Murphy is a guy who is in this series of vintage adventure games.

1630
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,240
So if you remember those old-school games like, I don't know,

1631
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:41,240
I don't want to say like Loom, but I'm thinking of the stuff like Deja Vu,

1632
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,240
maybe Shadow Gate type of stuff, I don't know, on the PC,

1633
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,240
King's Quest, throw in a little of that.

1634
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,240
If those sound fun to you, you can get new games in the series,

1635
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,240
Mean Streets and Martian Memorandum.

1636
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,240
They're kind of throwback games to that era,

1637
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:57,240
but I notice they mix in photography and a little bit of new stuff.

1638
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:02,240
You can all get these free. GOG.com is the place to get these games.

1639
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,240
Good ol' games.

1640
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:07,240
It's a holiday gift from right now until December 24th.

1641
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,240
Completely off topic, Rob.

1642
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,240
I thought you said fartography.

1643
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,240
That would be something completely different.

1644
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,240
The way that you said it, I thought you said fartography.

1645
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,240
I can't speak tonight. I don't know what it is.

1646
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,240
I've botched so many words on the night show.

1647
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,240
Rob can speak good.

1648
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,240
I might need to see a doctor.

1649
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,240
All right, anyhow.

1650
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,240
Thark Sockra, do you have some rapid-fire news for us?

1651
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:26,240
I guess I do, Rob.

1652
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:29,240
Well, don't make me twist your arm or nothing.

1653
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,240
You didn't bring us cupcakes, by the way.

1654
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:35,240
Well, boo-hoo, I'm sorry.

1655
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:39,240
At any rate, how about some more stuff for the iPhone?

1656
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:46,240
There is Need for Speed Shift coming out for iPhone for $9.99.

1657
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:52,240
20 cars, 18 tracks, tilt functionality, which means lack of functionality.

1658
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,240
And you can play over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

1659
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,240
That's pretty cool.

1660
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:02,240
Although I'm kind of a little uncomfortable to imagine what it might look like.

1661
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:05,240
But hey, it could come out really good.

1662
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:11,240
Also, in other iPhone and racing game-related news, we have a new Ridge Racer.

1663
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:19,240
We have Ridge Racer Accelerated, which will be on iPhone for $2.99.

1664
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:25,240
So I totally actually really dug the last Ridge Racer that came out on iPhone,

1665
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:28,240
even though I didn't play it too long because I did get a little pissed off.

1666
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,240
So give it a go. Let us know what you think.

1667
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:38,240
Also, one other thing, and this has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with Rock Band,

1668
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:41,240
because it's about Rock Band.

1669
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:49,240
The holiday lineup for Rock Band Weekly is going to be Weezer.

1670
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:55,240
We also have Songs from Limp Bizkit, the Offspring and Yellow card.

1671
01:32:55,240 --> 01:33:01,240
And don't forget, Rock Band Unplugged download content is on hiatus.

1672
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:05,240
So here's what we're looking at for the Weezer pack.

1673
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:11,240
We have Beverly Hills, Let It All Hang Out, and If You're Wondering If I Want You To, I Want You To.

1674
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:16,240
And then Limp Bizkit, Build A Bridge, The Offspring, A Lot Like Me, and Yellow Card Ocean Avenue.

1675
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,240
The latter three will be 160 points.

1676
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:24,240
The pack for Weezer is 440, or 160 for each, again.

1677
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:29,240
And they are also available for Lego Rock Band.

1678
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,240
The end!

1679
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:37,240
I was going to say that Riddhiers is pretty awesome to be coming to the iPhone, but it's no daytona.

1680
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:42,240
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo!

1681
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,240
Moving right along into other topics tonight.

1682
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:51,240
Hey, how about some Twitter topics?

1683
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:57,240
Every week we request your ideas and suggestions for topics over Twitter.

1684
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,240
And we like to read some of those right now.

1685
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,240
First, I gotta make sure, because I wasn't here earlier tonight,

1686
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:03,240
I gotta make sure some of these things don't duplicate things we're about to talk about later in the show,

1687
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,240
because that would be a little bit embarrassing.

1688
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:12,240
But TigerCaw305 sent us this article about gamers attempt to catch every Pokemon in 72 hours for charity.

1689
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,240
That's right, some very bored gamers have, no, it's for charity, you can't say that.

1690
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:20,240
But some gamers have decided to catch every Pokemon in existence.

1691
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,240
493 of them, to be exact.

1692
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,240
In 72 hours!

1693
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:25,240
It's all for charity.

1694
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:30,240
It's actually not for child's play, as a lot of these recent marathons have been for, which is obviously a great charity.

1695
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,240
This is for a different one, it's called Allie's House.

1696
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:37,240
It's an Oklahoma-based children's cancer foundation that provides support for families with medical expenses,

1697
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:40,240
short-term housing, and other types of needs.

1698
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:42,240
You can donate to the website.

1699
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,240
The SpeedyGamers are the guys that are doing this.

1700
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:49,240
I want a charity that involves killing Sims.

1701
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:52,240
There might be an idea for a marathon there.

1702
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:56,240
Put up a proposal, Loki, and bring it to the show, we might do this.

1703
01:34:56,240 --> 01:35:03,240
TigerCaw also sent us a quick link to an article that Blizzard will definitely work on a console game at some point.

1704
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:08,240
So, in other words, not Starcraft Ghost, but like, for real this time, some type of console game.

1705
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:11,240
Well, really, I think the title of this says it all.

1706
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:16,240
You know, they've done so many great PC games, maybe it's about time for them to do a console game.

1707
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,240
And they just wanted to clarify, I don't see the PC market as being bad.

1708
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,240
We didn't have 12 million players 10 years ago.

1709
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:26,240
Whatever the format, console or PC, I think if there's a good game, it's going to be played.

1710
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:29,240
We're working on PC because it's familiar to us.

1711
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:33,240
Console, we have to worry about those unfamiliar things.

1712
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:39,240
Also coming to us from Twitter, from Deathwishing, three questions from Deathwishing.

1713
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:42,240
Should I buy LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year?

1714
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:46,240
Yes, if you like platformers like Mario Brothers, yes, yes, yes, I think it's a great game.

1715
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,240
It was my game of the year, the year it came out.

1716
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:55,240
Plus, you get the beta for ModNation Racers, so you've got to act quick because that just started on the 18th.

1717
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:59,240
Socom Confrontation, I guess, is that a game?

1718
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,240
Confrontation.

1719
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:03,240
Confrontation, he spelled it wrong then. Confrontation.

1720
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,240
And did you guys try out Dante's Inferno?

1721
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,240
I did not try out Dante's Inferno.

1722
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:10,240
I downloaded the demo, I haven't played it yet because I was gone all weekend.

1723
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,240
I've heard it's pretty terrible.

1724
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,240
I've already played God of War, thank you.

1725
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,240
Have you checked out the demo?

1726
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,240
No, I haven't.

1727
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,240
I've heard it's pretty bad.

1728
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:24,240
But we'll see. Again, I don't like to base games purely off the demo.

1729
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,240
It's got a level of...

1730
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,240
Well, it's going to be good.

1731
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,240
I'll probably play it.

1732
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:34,240
I'll tell you right now, there's no way it's going to be Bayonetta.

1733
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:36,240
Oh, definitely not going to be Bayonetta.

1734
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:40,240
But if you're looking for a game like Dante's Inferno, it's probably dirt cheap right now.

1735
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:42,240
I'd go for Conan the Barbarian.

1736
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,240
Or just Conan.

1737
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,240
Not Age of Conan.

1738
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,240
Age of Conan, but Conan that came out on consoles last year.

1739
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,240
Conan the Librarian.

1740
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,240
Seriously, it's such a ripoff of God of War, but it's fun.

1741
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,240
And by now, it's probably like 20 bucks.

1742
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:56,240
Less than 20 bucks.

1743
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,240
Fair enough. Good deal.

1744
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,240
Gamergirl sent us a tweet.

1745
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:02,240
What's your take on Final Fantasy 13? Good or not so good?

1746
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:07,240
Couldn't tell you. Didn't import the game. Don't want to pay those types of fees when the game's coming out here in a few months.

1747
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,240
It's like 100 bucks and it's in Japanese only.

1748
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,240
I can't justify doing that.

1749
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,240
But the demo we played a few months ago and...

1750
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:20,240
The demo was fun, but once again, you know, I played the demo a few times and I'm like, why did I buy this?

1751
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,240
Whoops.

1752
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,240
That's right.

1753
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,240
But that wasn't anything about the game.

1754
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,240
It was just, why did you spend so much money on a demo?

1755
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:30,240
It's like, oh okay, I don't know what's really going on here.

1756
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:36,240
Let's see, look at some other tweets, a couple things of stuff that we did earlier in the show, and that is basically it.

1757
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,240
So thank you guys for your tweets.

1758
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,240
Again, we'll take some more next week.

1759
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:44,240
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us on Twitter.

1760
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,240
Meanwhile, back to some more news.

1761
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:50,240
Yes, Nintendo has some interesting things going on.

1762
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:57,240
They've announced their new titles coming out in the first part of the year.

1763
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:01,240
2010, of course, they're going to launch their first Wii game.

1764
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:06,240
It's going to be Endless Ocean 2, the sequel to the Deep Sea Diving Sim.

1765
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,240
I didn't really play a lot of the first one.

1766
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:14,240
It was kind of neat, very pretty, but not something I really want to jump into for the next one.

1767
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,240
Some DS titles, of course.

1768
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:26,240
The newest, I guess I wouldn't really call them brand new, but Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver, the kind of remix of Gold and Silver.

1769
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:29,240
And there's some other cool things.

1770
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:33,240
WiiWare titles, including And Yet It Moves.

1771
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:36,240
Of course, Super Meat Boy is kind of cool.

1772
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:42,240
They also have some third-party stuff listed as well.

1773
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:44,240
Nothing too stand out from Konami.

1774
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:51,240
For example, we've got Dance Dance Revolution, although I believe that's...

1775
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:54,240
No, maybe that is a new title, Dance Dance Revolution.

1776
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:58,240
I've heard there is some controversy going on right now, because I think that list came out.

1777
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:06,240
And right now, that brand new Dance Dance Revolution is only slated for PS3 and Xbox, and wasn't announced for Wii.

1778
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:09,240
So it's kind of like, was this the announcement or what?

1779
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,240
The other thing, too, with Dance Dance Revolution...

1780
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:16,240
I could see it probably coming to the Wii, but I remember before, they were kind of lumping in all those games.

1781
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:22,240
Before, at E3, as Dance Dance Revolution won, Dance Dance Revolution for the Wii ended up being hottest part, E3.

1782
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:27,240
And then, same for the PlayStation 2, it ended up being X2, so...

1783
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:31,240
It might not be entirely accurate, but that's alright.

1784
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:37,240
I have to say, as a long-time music game fan, and someone who's been critical of DDR over the past few years,

1785
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:42,240
I am interested in the reboot game that they're doing on Xbox 360 and PS3, because it is a reboot.

1786
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:46,240
Something I've been saying DDR has needed for about five years. We'll see.

1787
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:51,240
DDR hasn't just needed a reboot, it's needed a resuscitation and a kick in the ass.

1788
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:54,240
And we'll see if this is it, although I will say the expectations are very low.

1789
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:58,240
So Konami doesn't have to do much to impress me, so we'll see.

1790
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:06,240
The other thing that's going to be coming out also for the DS is WarioWare DIY, which is pretty cool.

1791
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:12,240
That's that WarioWare game where you actually create your own mini-games using tools provided in the game,

1792
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:19,240
including all sorts of weird things and some perverted things I've seen before on different YouTubes.

1793
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:23,240
So that's going to be available as well in March.

1794
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:30,240
And then finally, just in time for Valentine's Day, you're going to be getting pink and blue Wii remotes,

1795
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:38,240
are going to be released as well, I believe just before Valentine's Day.

1796
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:42,240
Yay, just as I always wanted a pink Wiimote.

1797
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,240
Oh, well then remind me to get you one, Rob.

1798
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:47,240
Yay, that's what I want for Christmas. Oh, damn, they're not out until February.

1799
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,240
Well...

1800
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,240
Maybe for my birthday.

1801
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:52,240
Now if they put out a pink console, that might sell a little bit. I don't know.

1802
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,240
Possibly.

1803
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,240
So...

1804
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,240
Yeah.

1805
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:58,240
Alright.

1806
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,240
The blue one's actually kind of cute.

1807
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:04,240
But remember, do you remember at E3 when they first showed the Wii?

1808
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:05,240
Mm-hmm.

1809
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,240
How there were the blue ones and the different colors?

1810
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:12,240
Oh yeah, there were all the different colors, but they didn't need to do that because the system sold like fucking nuts anyway, so...

1811
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,240
Five days.

1812
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:17,240
And the curse of the white system did not hurt it.

1813
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:22,240
Remember, because the, well, no, the Saturn...

1814
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:25,240
Well, I don't know what it is. Alright.

1815
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,240
The Saturn in Japan came out in white.

1816
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,240
We got it over here in black. What happened?

1817
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,240
Poop. Dead.

1818
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:34,240
So, see, they learned. They learned.

1819
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,240
Alright.

1820
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:40,240
Well, speaking of Nintendo, I want to get into this story real quick about some new trademarks that Nintendo has recently filed.

1821
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:41,240
That's right.

1822
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:47,240
Could this mean that a sequel to the Wii is imminent because there is a trademark that has been discovered for the Z?

1823
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,240
That's right.

1824
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:51,240
It's better than Wii because it's further in the alphabet.

1825
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,240
It's the Z.

1826
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:55,240
That's Z-I-I has been trademarked.

1827
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,240
Now, of course, rumors run rampant.

1828
01:41:57,240 --> 01:42:00,240
OMG, the Wii HD is the Z!

1829
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:05,240
By the way, though, just so you know, Z actually was trademarked in 2006.

1830
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:14,240
Also trademarked, the B, the C, the Wii, the YI, and the Z.

1831
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,240
This Sesame Street...

1832
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:19,240
I thought the Wii was oi.

1833
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,240
Oi, oi, oi, like a punk rock system.

1834
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:24,240
No, it's like...

1835
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,240
It's for the hardcore gamer, the oi, oi.

1836
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,240
No, it's French.

1837
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:28,240
I see.

1838
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:31,240
But, you know, also, though, keep in mind, it's like a...

1839
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:34,240
You know, that totally made me think of Clue.

1840
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,240
What?

1841
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,240
Wii Wii, madame?

1842
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,240
No, I'm sorry.

1843
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,240
How do I know this?

1844
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:41,240
They neglected the V because that's the one...

1845
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,240
The Chinese knockoff is called the V, isn't it?

1846
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,240
Yeah.

1847
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,240
Whoops, forgot that one.

1848
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:51,240
And, most importantly, you forgot the P.

1849
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,240
Where's the P?

1850
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:54,240
In the toilet!

1851
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:56,240
Ah!

1852
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,240
And they missed...

1853
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:58,240
Someone had to go there.

1854
01:42:58,240 --> 01:42:59,240
Now, see what's funny?

1855
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:00,240
Somebody in chat said they forgot Xii.

1856
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:03,240
Wasn't that the name of a game on PlayStation?

1857
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,240
I want to say.

1858
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:05,240
No, that was 13.

1859
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:10,240
Oh, so Xii was not taken by Xiiii was.

1860
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,240
She, though...

1861
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,240
That sounds familiar.

1862
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,240
I don't know.

1863
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:19,240
The Z thing, though, and, unfortunately, I don't have the ability to put that clip on,

1864
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:24,240
you know, our stream right now, but Z reminds me of Charlie the Unicorn, the second one,

1865
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:28,240
where they go and they meet Z and they start speaking Spanish to the Z.

1866
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:30,240
I remember that.

1867
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:35,240
And that would be totally appropriate for this, but...

1868
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:39,240
Deathwishing in chat says, the Nintendo oi with oi circle pit, run and mosh your face

1869
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,240
off.

1870
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:41,240
See, it's for the hardcore gamer.

1871
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:42,240
That's exactly what it is.

1872
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:46,240
We're going to do another story real quick here, but I wanted to introduce someone who

1873
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,240
just walked into the studio tonight.

1874
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:50,240
Say hello to Tiara.

1875
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,240
Why, hello there.

1876
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:53,240
How are you?

1877
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,240
I'm good, thank you.

1878
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:55,240
Thanks for joining us tonight.

1879
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,240
How have you been?

1880
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,240
You're tardy.

1881
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,240
You know we start at 6 o'clock, right?

1882
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:59,240
Yeah, I know.

1883
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,240
I went out on a date.

1884
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:02,240
Wait, hold on, hold on.

1885
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,240
Aren't you just visiting?

1886
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:08,240
Yeah, I'm visiting Jamie and I went out on a date with not Jamie.

1887
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:10,240
You're a very naughty girl.

1888
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,240
Did you have fun?

1889
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,240
Yes, I did.

1890
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:15,240
We saw The Blind Side, which I expected to hate, but apparently I like Sandra Bullock

1891
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:18,240
when she's not in a funny movie.

1892
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:19,240
Okay.

1893
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:20,240
Because she's not funny.

1894
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,240
There you go.

1895
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,240
Fair enough.

1896
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,240
She's not...

1897
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,240
The Net was not very good either when she...

1898
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:29,240
Well, no, that was unintentionally funny, I think, is the point there.

1899
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:31,240
So how have you been?

1900
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:35,240
I know you've been working on your blog and I see you posting away on the Twitters and

1901
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,240
feel free to plug whatever, but what have you been up to lately?

1902
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:42,240
Dude, I have played the hell out of Final Fantasy IV, the after years.

1903
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,240
That game is so awesome.

1904
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:45,240
I never finished it.

1905
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:48,240
I feel bad because it was pretty badass, the parts that I played.

1906
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:52,240
I played the opening chapter and I think I played a little bit of Rydia's side story,

1907
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:54,240
but lots and lots of side stories to beat in that game.

1908
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:55,240
Yeah, I have to be honest.

1909
01:44:55,240 --> 01:45:01,240
I didn't buy all of them, but I played through the opening chapter, which is the first three,

1910
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:05,240
and then I played through part of Rydia's chapter before I drove up here.

1911
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:10,240
So I'm excited to go home and play that and have the Wii Fit tell me how fat I am because

1912
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:12,240
it loves to do that.

1913
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:13,240
I know.

1914
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:16,240
It's always kind of a downer to get on Wii Fit and then you watch as your character goes

1915
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,240
whoop.

1916
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,240
It's like, oh.

1917
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,240
But surely that hasn't happened for you.

1918
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,240
You actually look like you've lost a little bit.

1919
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,240
Oh, well thank you.

1920
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,240
Wii Fit's been working for you.

1921
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,240
Well, it's fun.

1922
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:28,240
I'm a master of the hula hoop now.

1923
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:30,240
If only in real life.

1924
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,240
That was a good useful skill, but no.

1925
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:34,240
And you're still blogging, right?

1926
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,240
You're still doing your comic book reviews and so forth, right?

1927
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:44,240
Yeah, I still have my blog over at AvengersTower.com and Jamie blogs over there with me occasionally.

1928
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:51,240
Yeah, and I'm also blogging over at EatsleepGeek.com, which is another fun geeky blog.

1929
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,240
Cool.

1930
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,240
Who runs that?

1931
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,240
A bunch of geeks?

1932
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,240
Yes, I would have to say so.

1933
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,240
It's not just a clever name.

1934
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:58,240
Very good.

1935
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:00,240
So are we ever going to start now?

1936
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:06,240
I've heard rumors that someday there might be a giggling girl comic book show of sorts.

1937
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:09,240
Well, Jamie and I had talked about that.

1938
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:14,240
We had talked about doing kind of like a mini podcast for one of our weekly features for

1939
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:21,240
my blog, but we never have time and of course I'm trying to graduate next year, so I'm taking

1940
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:23,240
like eight classes in the semester.

1941
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,240
She's already got a show.

1942
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:27,240
Quit trying to ninja the hosts.

1943
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,240
Quit trying to ninja them into your show.

1944
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:30,240
I'm just kidding.

1945
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:33,240
We're using that computer.

1946
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:38,240
No, I heard they're going to borrow the show computer to do a side project, so that's awesome.

1947
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:41,240
I hope you guys are able to find the time, but certainly school is school.

1948
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:42,240
Yes, indeed.

1949
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:43,240
All right.

1950
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:48,240
If you ever need a guest who never reads comic books, I will totally come on and be like

1951
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:52,240
the gay guy on the show that says witty things.

1952
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:54,240
I will totally book you for that.

1953
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,240
Awesome.

1954
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:58,240
In my comics, I don't know anything about that, but Wolverine is hot.

1955
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:59,240
Exactly.

1956
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:01,240
I need you to call my manager, though.

1957
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,240
Oh, okay.

1958
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:04,240
I'll give you my card.

1959
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,240
Don't call us.

1960
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:06,240
We'll call you.

1961
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,240
All right.

1962
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,240
No, but feel free, please, to pipe in.

1963
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:12,240
Unfortunately, we don't have a fourth mic in the studio because we're a little ghetto,

1964
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,240
but if you want to say something, raise your hand.

1965
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:15,240
A little ghetto?

1966
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:18,240
Just reach your hand out and grab my mic, or grab Loki.

1967
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:19,240
He's closest.

1968
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,240
All right.

1969
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:23,240
Anyhow, moving on with some more gaming news, Dark Sakura.

1970
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:27,240
Oh, for the record, and completely off topic, you know how you're wondering if there was

1971
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:30,240
a game called Z?

1972
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:36,240
There was an alternate reality game that came out on the PS3 for PlayStation Home.

1973
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,240
That's right.

1974
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:42,240
Also, Devil Dice was called Psy, which was spelled X-I.

1975
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:45,240
So, we've had X-I, X-I-I, and X-I-I-I.

1976
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,240
We've had stuff.

1977
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:50,240
Well, I would like to create X-I-I-I-I, patent pending.

1978
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:52,240
Although, I guess that would really be...

1979
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:53,240
What, 13?

1980
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:55,240
No, X-I-I-I-I, 14.

1981
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:57,240
So, should it be X-I-V?

1982
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,240
You shut your mouth!

1983
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,240
La-la-la.

1984
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,240
Okay.

1985
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,240
So, how about my story, huh?

1986
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,240
How about your story?

1987
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,240
Yeah, how about that?

1988
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:11,240
How about a particular rumor about a game I'm particularly looking forward to?

1989
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:18,240
For Super Street Fighter IV, the rumor is that they're getting ten new characters total.

1990
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:31,240
There's actually something based off of a clip from the Thummie stream that's showing a different list on here.

1991
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:34,240
So, let me see if I can't find...

1992
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,240
Who else might be included on here?

1993
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:46,240
Well, I know for a fact that they're getting a DJ in Feilong, and Adon, and...

1994
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:47,240
Guy and Cody, right?

1995
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:49,240
Guy and Cody, and...

1996
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:55,240
I don't think they've announced any new ones, but there's, like, placeholders here, right?

1997
01:48:55,240 --> 01:49:08,240
Yeah, well, see, there's four here that are completely blank according to this, and I can actually link the clip to the chatroom if they want to look at it.

1998
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:13,240
It definitely, I think, would be worth seeing.

1999
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,240
But from what I can tell on here...

2000
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,240
No, Dan, you can't talk to me right now.

2001
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:18,240
Sorry.

2002
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:23,240
What I can tell on here is that...

2003
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:33,240
Yeah, I recognize just about everybody else on here, so I wouldn't think of who they could have put in unless they're adding in, like, Charlie, and Rolando, and maybe Hagar.

2004
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:41,240
What's interesting is that the game, we were only supposed to be getting, like, six, I think, in an earlier review, or maybe it was seven or eight, but now it's up to ten.

2005
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,240
Like, it's almost like they can't put this down.

2006
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:46,240
They can't get away from this project, which is, you know, it's a good thing.

2007
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:50,240
It means that they really love it, but that's a lot of new characters too.

2008
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:55,240
It's just these four empty slots on here, it makes me wonder, you know, what's going to go in.

2009
01:49:55,240 --> 01:50:00,240
This has to be from some kind of beta or demo on here.

2010
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:03,240
Clearly one is going to be for Yoda, and one is going to be for Darth Vader.

2011
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:06,240
Obviously, this is the download content.

2012
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:11,240
I think that it should have the Tatsunoko versus Capcom people thrown in.

2013
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:18,240
Some folks in the chatroom, Leo Shen says it's Ibuki, Dudley, and Makoto from what I heard, and I know the Ibuki rumor has been all around the internet.

2014
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:22,240
And then Bob Coffee says Hakan equals an Arab oil dude.

2015
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,240
Ono talked about but hasn't been revealed yet.

2016
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:31,240
And I've heard that rumor too, that there was some type of, like, oil tycoon fighter in it as well.

2017
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:35,240
Okay, Game Guru, is Charlie really dead or is he Jean Grey dead?

2018
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,240
Answer that.

2019
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:41,240
Maybe Street Fighter is like Heroes, where people die but they don't ever, like, die.

2020
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:43,240
Maybe it's like Heroes where they get their brains eaten.

2021
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:49,240
Or maybe it's like Heroes where it starts to suck by the third season, but then gets good again at the fourth season.

2022
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:54,240
And then I stopped watching it at the fourth season, but apparently, you know.

2023
01:50:54,240 --> 01:51:00,240
Of course you realize all I know about Heroes is the brain eating, and the cheerleader is like Wolverine.

2024
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:04,240
Look, I'm just saying, Street Fighter doesn't have Zachary Quinto, okay? That's all I'm saying.

2025
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:06,240
That's all I'm saying. ZQ or GTFO.

2026
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:15,240
Maybe it's like that episode of Heroes where Spock accidentally blows up Romulus and Nero goes back in time to find him.

2027
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:24,240
Perhaps. Actually, in an unrelated story that I don't think we covered yet, but did you hear about that, that ZQ actually announced this week at the Video Game Awards?

2028
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:26,240
He's going to be doing the voice for Star Trek Online.

2029
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,240
Yes.

2030
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:32,240
I guess, like, doing the opening narration or whatever, and I'm just like, he can talk to me anytime he wants.

2031
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:35,240
But he will be doing a William Shatner impression.

2032
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,240
No.

2033
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:41,240
You know what, by the way, I have decided to get the Amazon one, because I want a Borg chick.

2034
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:42,240
Okay, fair enough.

2035
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,240
She wants a Borg chick.

2036
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,240
I want a really ugly, I want a really ugly Borg chick.

2037
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,240
You want a Borg chick? What? No, I'm just kidding.

2038
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,240
I haven't decided which version of the game I'm getting yet.

2039
01:51:50,240 --> 01:52:02,240
All I know is that I kind of want to play like a sassy Vulcan, which I know is kind of a contradiction, but I think sometimes the only logic is sass.

2040
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:08,240
Okay, I'm going to totally out myself as a super nerd, but I read the Star Trek novels.

2041
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:09,240
Nerd!

2042
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:16,240
And in the novels, there's a half-Vulcan who totally rejects her Vulcan side and is kind of sassy.

2043
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:19,240
So, yeah, you could be sassy.

2044
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:23,240
I can't play MMOs and not be sassy. It's my thing.

2045
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:25,240
Remember, we have to make the O.L. Orient.

2046
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:27,240
That's true, and I'll have one of those.

2047
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,240
You have to be sassy in the pants.

2048
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:31,240
I have to have a sassy Vulcan.

2049
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:33,240
You have to be sassy in the pants.

2050
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:35,240
That's right. Absolutely.

2051
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:37,240
I started playing WoW again, Rob. Did you see that?

2052
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,240
Sucker! How's it going?

2053
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:45,240
It's going good. My priest is almost 43. I've been using that dungeon finder thing.

2054
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:48,240
And Jamie's on the phone with Dan.

2055
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:50,240
That must be important.

2056
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:52,240
The dungeon finder's great, though.

2057
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:58,240
Oh, yeah. I leveled from 37 to 42 in two days just doing that. So nice.

2058
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,240
It wasn't important.

2059
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:04,240
I'm also getting Star Trek Online, obviously, because I'm a big, huge nerd.

2060
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:06,240
Final Fantasy XIV we talked about earlier in the show.

2061
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:08,240
Eh, eh, eh. What?

2062
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:12,240
Probably not.

2063
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,240
All right. Fair enough.

2064
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:15,240
Some comments in chat about the sassy Vulcan.

2065
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:21,240
Salacious Pop says, instead of saying, that's not logical, she says, so ignorant.

2066
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:23,240
So ignorant.

2067
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:28,240
SSG 100 Matt says, Rob's character, live long and prosper, bitch.

2068
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:31,240
That's a good one. I like that.

2069
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:33,240
We'll see what happens there.

2070
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:37,240
Also, Tigerclaw's letting me know some specifics on that.

2071
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:40,240
Apparently, he's also doing the voice of the emergency medical hologram.

2072
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:42,240
Although, I gotta say, come on.

2073
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,240
The guy who did it, what was his name?

2074
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:50,240
The emergency hologram program, Robert Picardo or whatever his name was in Voyager.

2075
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:54,240
When you think emergency medical program, I always think of him.

2076
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:57,240
Remember how they got him a cameo in First Contact?

2077
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:01,240
We watched some of that last night.

2078
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:04,240
Did you really? I was watching through your window.

2079
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:07,240
I wanted to be at your slumber party, but I couldn't and I was jealous.

2080
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:10,240
What was it you were saying? We were going for the whole revenge theme?

2081
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,240
Because we watched Wrath of Khan before that?

2082
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:16,240
We watched Wrath of Khan and then she said, I wanted to watch good Star Trek movies,

2083
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:19,240
but she tried to put in Star Trek 3.

2084
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:21,240
I like Star Trek 3.

2085
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:23,240
I actually like that one.

2086
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:26,240
Dan lost my copy.

2087
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:28,240
Anyhow, sorry, let's get into some other gaming news.

2088
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:31,240
Just a couple quick articles. We're going to get to the mail back here very soon. Loki.

2089
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:39,240
Yes, Nintendo has trademarked what is going to be about equally retarded as the Wii Vitality Sensor.

2090
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:42,240
Wii Relax.

2091
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:46,240
Yes, it's a game about relaxing.

2092
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:51,240
It involves you putting on a Vitality Sensor so that you can relax.

2093
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:54,240
Relax or die.

2094
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:59,240
Actually, wasn't there a mode? I think it's in Wii Fit.

2095
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:02,240
One of the games, I think it's one of the last things you unlock is a

2096
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:07,240
sit on the balance board as still as you possibly can.

2097
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:10,240
If your fat ass moves too much, you're going to blow out the candle.

2098
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:13,240
It's like a relaxed mini-game or something.

2099
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:14,240
I seem to remember.

2100
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:18,240
Now you're telling me that don't move your ass is turning into a full game?

2101
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:24,240
Isn't that kind of counter-intuitive with the whole Wii Fit?

2102
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:28,240
Am I supposed to be moving?

2103
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:33,240
Well, no. The only thing I've ever known, like any type of exercise thing I've ever done

2104
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:38,240
where you have to keep perfectly still is doing isolation exercises.

2105
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:40,240
Other than that, I don't know.

2106
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:45,240
I'm grabbing at straws here. I'm trying to find some logic in this.

2107
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:48,240
I don't know. Hopefully the game is going to say, you know,

2108
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:52,240
relax, but don't touch yourself.

2109
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:54,240
No wanking.

2110
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:59,240
Wait a second. Game's going to be like, please put it on your finger.

2111
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:02,240
Wait a second. That is not your finger.

2112
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,240
Stop that. That is dirty.

2113
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:09,240
Please do not be fapping.

2114
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:13,240
It'll be like Miss Nude World 96 where if it detects something bad going on,

2115
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:17,240
then the image flips to the devil picture.

2116
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:20,240
Honestly, like a whole two people have probably ever played that game in MAME

2117
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:23,240
and get that reference, but Loki's raising his hand.

2118
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:26,240
Somebody out there will understand what I'm talking about, and it's quite funny.

2119
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,240
I promise.

2120
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:30,240
Anyhow.

2121
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,240
Other things.

2122
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:34,240
I like how they show this girl in the picture that they picked.

2123
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:38,240
She looks like either a mannequin or a corpse.

2124
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,240
Can't get more relaxed than a corpse.

2125
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:46,240
I can just see it now. Person dies while playing Wii Relax, and the game never knew.

2126
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:48,240
High score.

2127
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:52,240
World Record and Wii Relax.

2128
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:54,240
Anyhow, that's terrible.

2129
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:58,240
Hey, we should do that. We should try to go for the World Record.

2130
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,240
And Wii Relax? No, then we'll die.

2131
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:05,240
That's the only way you're going to get the World Record is to die while playing Wii Relax.

2132
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,240
It's worth it.

2133
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:09,240
No.

2134
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,240
I like the whole living thing.

2135
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:16,240
I like this idea better. How about we go kill a million freaking zombies?

2136
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:19,240
That would be super awesome. That always makes a good game.

2137
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:22,240
Hence why Left 4 Dead is so freaking amazing.

2138
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:28,240
Apparently, what's going on here is that they're going to get characters from the original Left 4 Dead

2139
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:33,240
to now hang out with the new characters.

2140
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:37,240
So apparently the old characters and the new characters from Left 4 Dead 2

2141
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:42,240
will meet in a game called The Passing, or a download content piece.

2142
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:45,240
It's called The Most Important Campaign in the Left 4 Dead Story.

2143
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:48,240
All the survivors are being called together in one campaign.

2144
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:51,240
That's from the Valve VP of Marketing, Doug Lombardi.

2145
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:54,240
That's going to come out in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PC.

2146
01:57:54,240 --> 01:58:00,240
It's going to have a co-op campaign in rural Georgia and a cooperative challenge mode of play.

2147
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:02,240
There will be survival versus a scavenge mode.

2148
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:08,240
If you play as the Left 4 Dead 2 cast, you get a new melee weapon, firearm, and uncommon common zombie.

2149
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:12,240
That's kind of interesting that they are going to bring the two worlds together.

2150
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:15,240
But kind of cool. I bet fans of the series are going to be very excited about that.

2151
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:19,240
I wonder if that also means that maybe there's going to be an eight player type of mode now.

2152
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:22,240
That sounds like it could be pretty awesome.

2153
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:24,240
So there you go.

2154
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:26,240
Coming soon.

2155
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:28,240
Coming to you right now is the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

2156
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:31,240
It's the part of the show every week where we take some emails and read them for you.

2157
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:33,240
Live on air.

2158
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:37,240
So Dark Sakura, please open up the meal bag.

2159
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:40,240
What? I can't talk tonight.

2160
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:43,240
I'm broken. I need to be fixed.

2161
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,240
Not in that way.

2162
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:47,240
I need to wee relax.

2163
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,240
You need to get us cupcakes.

2164
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:51,240
I do not need a god damn cupcake.

2165
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:54,240
You need to get us cupcakes.

2166
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:56,240
How's that going to help me?

2167
01:58:56,240 --> 01:59:00,240
You'll be doing a good deed and it will make you feel better in your heart.

2168
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:05,240
Isn't wee relax thinking about baseball anyways?

2169
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:08,240
Wee relax is mean...

2170
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:10,240
Think about it.

2171
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:15,240
And it makes your wee relax.

2172
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,240
They should do wee irritate.

2173
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:19,240
Mailbag!

2174
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:24,240
Well this is sort of a mass email so I'm going to go ahead and read it.

2175
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,240
I have a question.

2176
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:28,240
If a kid has the money to get a console but no games,

2177
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:31,240
should the parent get the games for that console?

2178
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,240
For me, it is an Xbox 360.

2179
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:35,240
I can only survive on demos for so long.

2180
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:37,240
Sincerely, DS Master 26.

2181
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:41,240
P.S. This is typed on a wee with wee mode and I'm visually impaired and lawsuits are a disgrace.

2182
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,240
Shame on him.

2183
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:48,240
Okay. McDonald's is an equal opportunity employer.

2184
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:51,240
You can get a job and save up and buy yourself some games.

2185
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:54,240
Parents don't have to buy you shit.

2186
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:59,240
Parents might reward you with games or consoles or what have you

2187
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:01,240
if you've been a good little boy and or girl

2188
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:04,240
and you do chores around the house and what have you.

2189
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:09,240
Or maybe you're in a household where you're fortunate enough to be spoiled to your heart's content

2190
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:11,240
like maybe Paris Hilton was when she was growing up.

2191
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:14,240
Unfortunately, that's not the way most of us have it.

2192
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:19,240
So parents don't have to buy anything at all.

2193
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:22,240
In fact, keep in mind in this economy of people losing their jobs and stuff,

2194
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:26,240
some parents can't afford to buy games at all.

2195
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:32,240
So you might be lucky to be getting a variety puzzle book from Penny Press.

2196
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:38,240
If you've got a Wii and an Xbox 360, you can sell one of them to get games for the other.

2197
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:46,240
The reason I can get away with having all of these systems is because, well, until I hurt my hand,

2198
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:48,240
I had enough money to buy them.

2199
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:54,240
In certain states, if you're like 14, you can get a work permit and go work at certain places.

2200
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:58,240
And you know what? It's not a bad idea because work experience goes a long way.

2201
02:00:58,240 --> 02:01:02,240
I mean, you might not want to work, but if you want a really cushy job in the future,

2202
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:06,240
working the crap jobs now help get you there faster.

2203
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:07,240
Moulins.

2204
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:09,240
So just something to think about.

2205
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:11,240
Moulins unless you have lethal allergies.

2206
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:13,240
So, yeah, you'll find something.

2207
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:19,240
If you were skilled enough to type this email on a Wii or whatever,

2208
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,240
you probably can help old ladies and old men set up.

2209
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,240
It just says visually impaired.

2210
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:27,240
Still, you can probably help old ladies and old men get their computers set up or something.

2211
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:30,240
I bet there's a lot of things that you probably can still do.

2212
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,240
Yeah, you just have to look around for it.

2213
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:37,240
And on top of that, it's not like you can't start a change jar.

2214
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:43,240
But maybe your parents don't want you to get a job at 14, and that's their prerogative.

2215
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:46,240
You know, my parents didn't want me to have a job that young because they wanted me to focus on studying.

2216
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:50,240
So maybe try to work something out with your parents.

2217
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:51,240
You get an allowance?

2218
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:53,240
I want this game. How can I get this game?

2219
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:58,240
Can I get a job? Can I do chores around the house? Can I get good grades?

2220
02:01:58,240 --> 02:02:01,240
That's not something I got the answer to.

2221
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:05,240
Your parents will raise you however they want and or can.

2222
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:13,240
Or, you know, and certainly in other cases, you know, when I say parents, I mean whoever is caring for you right now.

2223
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:14,240
Legal guardian.

2224
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:17,240
Your guardians, et cetera, et cetera, just because there's many different types of families out there.

2225
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:18,240
I just want to point that out.

2226
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:20,240
Okay. The last one is big.

2227
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:22,240
Ah, long email.

2228
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:28,240
Okay, hey, OLR crew, since I probably can't make it to tonight's episode due to finals and such, ooh, I'm sorry,

2229
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:31,240
I thought I'd email my review of the game I'd like to share with everyone.

2230
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:37,240
Mushihime-sama Futari, a 2D bullet hell shooter from awesome folks at Cave.

2231
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:44,240
For those who haven't been caught up on the recent shmup news, the recent Xbox 360 port of Futari is region-free.

2232
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:48,240
Having heard this news, I preordered my copy and received it within a week and a half of it shipping out.

2233
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:50,240
So far, the game is mind-blowing.

2234
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:55,240
After having played Touhou for a few months, Futari is especially pretty in comparison.

2235
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:58,240
The games are very nicely detailed and vivid.

2236
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:03,240
Although there is slowdown, it's implemented on purpose in order to make the game easier at times.

2237
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:08,240
As far as play options and modes go, Futari offers a wide variety of them.

2238
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:12,240
You can customize the game's display to your liking from the rotation of the screen,

2239
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:15,240
for those dedicated enough to rotate their TVs for vertical shooters,

2240
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:19,240
to more intricate details like display filters and scan lines.

2241
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:24,240
The main mode, version 1.5, offers three difficulty levels from the arcade, original, fairly simple gameplay,

2242
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:28,240
maniac, more difficult bullet patterns and an engaging scoring system,

2243
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:34,240
and the infamous ultra difficulty, home of the final boss that is featured in many a YouTube video.

2244
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:38,240
Then there's a range mode, a unique and complex twist on the regular gameplay,

2245
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:45,240
with the ability to switch characters as well as slow down bullets close to you and reflect them back to crank out tons of points.

2246
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:49,240
And if you're looking for stress relief or are bad at shooters, there's the novice mode,

2247
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:53,240
a glorified easy mode that offers the easy versions of original, maniac, and ultra.

2248
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:56,240
I tried novice ultra, and the bullet patterns are dense enough that you go,

2249
02:03:56,240 --> 02:04:03,240
ah, wow, but they have very sensible gaps so you can enjoy the pretty bullet patterns without having to struggle to avoid them.

2250
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:08,240
I beat this mode on one credit on my first try, and I still found it to be a very fun experience.

2251
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:11,240
Overall, I really like this game. It's worth the $70 I paid for it,

2252
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:16,240
and yes, I just said that a non-multi-hour game is worth $70.

2253
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:18,240
Holy shit, I just committed a capital offense.

2254
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:23,240
Every time I do a session of futari, I come across something new that just amazes me,

2255
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:29,240
whether it's a new scoring trick, a new way to dodge bullet barrages, or a game mechanic I wasn't fully aware of.

2256
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:34,240
Arrangement, for instance, took me two playthroughs of this rather fun mode to get to grips with its mechanics.

2257
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:37,240
My one complaint so far is the pricing of the expansion pack.

2258
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:45,240
The Mushihime Futari Black Label offers revised original and maniac modes as well as a new god mode that is like ultra mode,

2259
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:48,240
but with somewhat less retardedness. Is that a word?

2260
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,240
And new shot types.

2261
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:55,240
While I like Black Label, I question whether it's worth the 1200 Microsoft points,

2262
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:59,240
especially since I can get Raiden Fighter's Aces 3 games in one for $5 more,

2263
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:04,240
or one of a handful of standalone shmups for anywhere between $5 to $10.

2264
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:08,240
If you're a dedicated bullet hell fan or have an Xbox 360 of any region lying around,

2265
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:11,240
you owe it to yourself to snap up a copy of Futari for $360.

2266
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:16,240
I mean, hey, 70 bucks? At least you're not paying triple digits for the arcade hardware.

2267
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:18,240
And that's from Ray Ayanami slash GS68.

2268
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:23,240
PS, this email is brought to you by San Jose State University, home of the never-ending for low days.

2269
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:25,240
It's on the list of things to play.

2270
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:31,240
The next one on my list other than Bayonetta for my Japanese region system was Ootomedia is Gorgeous

2271
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:33,240
was the next one I wanted to play.

2272
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:39,240
Then, of course, the one he mentioned was third on the list.

2273
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:46,240
That's so interesting, though, that it would actually put a mode in there for you to, like, turn the TV around.

2274
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:47,240
Do those people do that?

2275
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:52,240
No, we actually bought a monitor, and it turned out that the monitor wasn't the right type.

2276
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:55,240
We bought an EGA monitor by accident, but it had a rotation.

2277
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:58,240
In fact, Dan's monitor here rotates.

2278
02:05:58,240 --> 02:06:03,240
So he's actually pulled out the monitor and rotated it to play shmups,

2279
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:08,240
because I think he got, like, Raiden and Raiden 2 to run on MAME.

2280
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:11,240
So, yeah, he's... it works.

2281
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:13,240
Hmm.

2282
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:16,240
All right, well, thank you for the review. We appreciate it.

2283
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:18,240
And, of course, you can always send in your own game review if you want to.

2284
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:21,240
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send emails.

2285
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:22,240
Was that it for emails tonight?

2286
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:23,240
It was indeed.

2287
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:24,240
Well, then, there you go.

2288
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:26,240
So let's move on to some more stories.

2289
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:31,240
Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2290
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,240
But not just yet.

2291
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:35,240
For now, let's do some last few stories here.

2292
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:38,240
Well, before we do stories, though...

2293
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:41,240
Oh! Gosh, that's right, we have to get to the angst.

2294
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:43,240
Well, not now, because DarkSaga just ran to use the potty.

2295
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:44,240
So we'll do the stories in the angst.

2296
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:46,240
She went through a different type of angst.

2297
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:47,240
Yes.

2298
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:53,240
Anyways, there's a rumor that NHL 2K11 may be cancelled.

2299
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:58,240
And maybe 2K Sports is in some sort of financial trouble.

2300
02:06:58,240 --> 02:07:08,240
This is coming from the recently released Take-Two's Q4 fiscal 2009 results.

2301
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:13,240
There's a section of games that the publisher is currently planning to ship in 2010.

2302
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:20,240
Both MLB 2K10 and NBA 2K11 are listed on the report, although I would think it's...

2303
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:22,240
I can't remember if it's 2K9.

2304
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:23,240
Yeah, I guess that's right there.

2305
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:24,240
You're behind or whatever.

2306
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:33,240
Anyways, and of course, that NHL 2K11 is not on the list.

2307
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:34,240
It's interesting.

2308
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:43,240
It says, we are currently in the process of evaluating our sports portfolio and have not announced any new NHL titles at this time.

2309
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:48,240
And that's a pretty damning statement, they put it.

2310
02:07:48,240 --> 02:08:00,240
And also seeing that if NHL 2K is no more, the franchise appears to be dying the same death as College Hoops 2K series.

2311
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:07,240
So they're kind of slim-lining their portfolio as far as their sports games.

2312
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:15,240
And honestly, I'm kind of surprised with the NHL stuff because I always thought that NHL 2K did a lot better than the NHL...

2313
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:22,240
EA's NHL games, and I think it was a better put-together game.

2314
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:31,240
At least my friend at work who's really huge in the hockey used to pick up the 2K series quite often, and he seemed to like it a lot better.

2315
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:33,240
But, eh, who knows?

2316
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:51,240
And of course, they're wondering that maybe 2K Sports as a publisher might be in some trouble as well, seeing as MLB 2K apparently didn't do that well last year, or I should say earlier this year.

2317
02:08:51,240 --> 02:09:03,240
Also, some of the EA games hockey stuff has done a lot better than NHL 2K, regardless of quality.

2318
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:16,240
And of course, since EA has the NFL license still, they can't even really make a football game, even though they did try with that All-American Football 2K or whatever that sucked.

2319
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:22,240
Well, I hope it's not that a series is going away, because that's going to leave very few hockey simulation games.

2320
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:28,240
So, you know, I always am a fan of more competition, that's for sure.

2321
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:33,240
One other story for you guys before we get to the FUs of the Week and then the Skype line, and that has to do with Champions Online.

2322
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:40,240
And if you played and disliked Champion Online, which as I understand many of you did, maybe a giant teddy bear will change your mind.

2323
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:44,240
That's right, Mecha Teddy has made its way into Champions Online.

2324
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:49,240
It's called the Attack of the Misfit Toys, it's a seasonal event that's going on in Champions Online right now.

2325
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:53,240
And I guess it has a new villain called Black Harlequin is one villain in it.

2326
02:09:53,240 --> 02:09:57,240
And there's also a villain that is just a giant mechanical teddy bear.

2327
02:09:57,240 --> 02:10:02,240
So if you want to kill a big teddy bear, make your way to Champions Online right now.

2328
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:03,240
That's awesome.

2329
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:07,240
I have to admit, that is kind of awesome, but I've heard the game was not anything to scream about.

2330
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:11,240
But sometimes MMOs have rough launches and then they get better as time goes on.

2331
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:15,240
I mean let's face it, how many times did Warcraft evolve, right?

2332
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:18,240
I mean Warcraft didn't really get rolling until it was out for a couple of years.

2333
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:20,240
How long until Warcraft gets giant teddy bears?

2334
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:23,240
I don't know, who knows.

2335
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:25,240
Anyhow, there are no-

2336
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:27,240
What is Warcraft doing for their holiday event?

2337
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:31,240
They kind of do the same thing they do usually during the holiday events.

2338
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:32,240
There's random Santas all over the place.

2339
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:36,240
They call it the festival something, I don't remember.

2340
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:41,240
They have to give everything very generic holiday names because they're not taken from the real world.

2341
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:44,240
But they do holiday events pretty much the same every year.

2342
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:46,240
But sometimes they add new things like a new boss.

2343
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:49,240
Or this year they added the Thanksgiving event was brand new.

2344
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:51,240
So they kind of go back to the calendar and add new things.

2345
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:53,240
But they do holidays throughout the year.

2346
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:57,240
Anyhow, let's get to the FUs of the week because I missed doing it earlier.

2347
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:17,240
But I just wanted to talk about teddy bears. Can you blame me?

2348
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:20,240
You know what? I've had a really great weekend.

2349
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:30,240
So I can't really say FU to anything except maybe situations regarding a late paycheck and EDD.

2350
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:36,240
I've heard that California, I don't know about disability, but unemployment especially had some hurdles recently too.

2351
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:38,240
I don't know if that affected all ends of it.

2352
02:11:38,240 --> 02:11:45,240
I'm actually more pissed off at EDD for not sending me certain paperwork that I needed to fill out three weeks ago.

2353
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:49,240
So I'm still waiting on three weeks of pay.

2354
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:54,240
But starting next week though, I'm back to getting some of my regular checks.

2355
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,240
Woot.

2356
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:56,240
Loki.

2357
02:11:56,240 --> 02:12:08,240
FU to people that think it's necessary to put inflatable holiday decorations out on their lawn and or house.

2358
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:11,240
Apparently it is just really prevalent this year.

2359
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:12,240
I mean, they're all over the fucking place.

2360
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:15,240
In fact, our neighbor's house across the street decided,

2361
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:20,240
Hey, you'll be a great idea. Let's put Frosty the snowman on our roof with some presents.

2362
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:23,240
It looks like a giant fucking snowman is attacking the house.

2363
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:27,240
It is just retarded and people need to...

2364
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:29,240
Maybe that's the next champions online boss. Who knows?

2365
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:30,240
They need to cut it back.

2366
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:34,240
I mean, because they've got all sorts of inflatable things from, you know,

2367
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:40,240
giant snow globes to there's a guy in the corner that has Santa riding a Harley.

2368
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:47,240
It's ridiculous. And I mean, it's just another thing that the holiday can barf onto your house

2369
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:51,240
because there's some people that have everything and they just keep adding every year.

2370
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:55,240
And oh my God, one house looks like they threw the lights just over the house and that's it.

2371
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:57,240
It's sad.

2372
02:12:57,240 --> 02:13:01,240
I like Dark Sakura. Things are pretty good for me right now.

2373
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:03,240
So I don't have a lot of angst actually.

2374
02:13:03,240 --> 02:13:07,240
But I will say FU to mob mentality, especially on the internets.

2375
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:09,240
God, some people are real sheep.

2376
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:12,240
Clearly I'm not talking about any of you, of course.

2377
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:13,240
Folks listening, what have you.

2378
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:17,240
It's just things I observe as I lurk on the internets.

2379
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:22,240
Well, I do also, though, think there should be an FU directed to that site too.

2380
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:24,240
Oh yeah, of course. Well, that goes...

2381
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:26,240
God, they got 20 minutes of an FU earlier.

2382
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:28,240
I don't need to give them any more time.

2383
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:31,240
All right. And of course, how could we forget Tiara's here?

2384
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:34,240
Maybe she wants to get in on the angst tonight.

2385
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:39,240
I would like to say FU to people who deny the Holocaust.

2386
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:42,240
How can you do that?

2387
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:46,240
I know. I'm laughing because it's ridiculous.

2388
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:54,240
Well, a PE teacher in Las Vegas was suspended for telling students that the Holocaust didn't exist

2389
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:57,240
and that photographs were doctored, textbooks are inaccurate,

2390
02:13:57,240 --> 02:14:00,240
and that the Nazis lacked the technology to kill so many people.

2391
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:05,240
And I just hope they fire her. FU to that lady.

2392
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:09,240
Wow. Wow. That's all I can say is wow.

2393
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:11,240
I don't know. I kind of put...

2394
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:17,240
Well, that's really bad, but the whole 9-11 conspiracy theories, like...

2395
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:20,240
Come on. Really?

2396
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:27,240
Well, first of all, in both situations you've got first person accounts from people who were there.

2397
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:30,240
You know, it's ridiculous.

2398
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:36,240
You know, I realize we have freedom of speech and all in this country, but good Lord.

2399
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:37,240
Use it appropriately.

2400
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:41,240
All right. Anyhow, we've got to get to the phones.

2401
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:44,240
We're actually going to start off tonight with a caller who should already be on the line.

2402
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:46,240
Caller, are you there?

2403
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:47,240
Yes, I'm here.

2404
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:49,240
Hi. Who is this?

2405
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:50,240
This is SSJ100 Matt.

2406
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:54,240
SSJ100 Matt, thank you so much for being on the show tonight. How are you doing?

2407
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:57,240
I'm doing very well and it sounds like you guys are doing well, too.

2408
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:59,240
Excellent. Yes, actually we're doing pretty good.

2409
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:03,240
When two of the three hosts have very little to rant about, it's usually a good night.

2410
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:07,240
But what's on your mind? What do we owe this phone call tonight?

2411
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:14,240
Well, as many people have been following, the Orange Land Revolution second mix is coming out this week.

2412
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:18,240
Yes, we talked about it at the top of the show, of course, but for those that tuned in late,

2413
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:25,240
it's like a fan project dedicated to the show, which low-key, myself and Dark Soccer, we didn't do shit for this project.

2414
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:26,240
We didn't do anything.

2415
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:34,240
Well, not directly. You guys created the shenanigans as the show and we kind of went with it.

2416
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:41,240
I would say I'm the lead developer, but you know what? This has all been a group effort.

2417
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:46,240
A lot of listeners have contributed and it took us two years,

2418
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:50,240
but I think we made a very great game.

2419
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:52,240
Well, tell us about some of the thank yous.

2420
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:59,240
Who are some of the people we need to give hugs and kisses to for making this game happen besides you?

2421
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:05,240
I would say the hardcore listeners. We have Act Def who worked on a couple songs.

2422
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:16,240
Dark Tetsuya, Misty, Breslul, who gave us the amazing announcer pack, and a lot of other people I can't even think of.

2423
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:24,240
Did you really have to put that guy song in there, though? Because I saw that YouTube and I was like, what is this?

2424
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:29,240
It's already bad enough. I was actually listening to Understation Live, not this week, but last week,

2425
02:16:29,240 --> 02:16:34,240
and I heard that thing, I don't know, it was a song from The Karate Kid or something,

2426
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:38,240
and then suddenly it just goes into, the best! The best! The best!

2427
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:45,240
And I'm like, what is this? Is this funny? I'm laughing because of how stupid it is.

2428
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:51,240
You know I love Breslul and he knows I love him, but there's clearly an inside joke here I'm not understanding,

2429
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:54,240
but I'm laughing because it's stupid funny like Showgirls.

2430
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,240
The inside joke is just John.

2431
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:58,240
I see, okay. Fair enough.

2432
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:04,240
But, you know, we have a lot of things in there from, you know, back from your old days, from U.S.L.

2433
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:11,240
Oh God, oh man, you want to talk about embarrassing stuff? I'd rather the Like a Prayer stuff be released on, like,

2434
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:14,240
Entertainment Tonight than some of the old U.S.L. clips.

2435
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:18,240
Oh, well, we pretty much have everything that you've sung on there, so.

2436
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:20,240
Great.

2437
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:23,240
Contributed by a certain Mr. Donovan.

2438
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:29,240
Oh, love, oh great, I'm sure. Loki, be glad we didn't know you back then,

2439
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:33,240
because Travis had a way of getting you to make an ass out of yourself on the radio.

2440
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:34,240
I wouldn't have been.

2441
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:38,240
God bless Travis Donovan, I would probably not be doing internet radio right now still if it were not for him.

2442
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:42,240
You still remember the number one way to make him upset was to drop the C-bomb.

2443
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:43,240
That's right!

2444
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:46,240
And you kept doing it.

2445
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:50,240
Because it was my favorite word at the time. But anyhow.

2446
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:55,240
Well, you know, Loki didn't get unscathed on this, so both of his performances are in the game.

2447
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:56,240
Thank God.

2448
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:59,240
This is why I don't do karaoke on the internet.

2449
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:03,240
Were you able to find anything embarrassing of Dark Sakura?

2450
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:08,240
Actually, no, we haven't been able to, you know, we have our archivers, but no one was able to find anything.

2451
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:11,240
Ask Travis for the apology song.

2452
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:13,240
No!

2453
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:14,240
That's all I'm going to say.

2454
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:18,240
No, no, no, actually that would piss me off.

2455
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:22,240
Beyond piss her off with laughter.

2456
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:26,240
I don't understand why we have to get the bad stuff, but...

2457
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:30,240
No, that's actually something that I'm still upset with him about, so...

2458
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:34,240
Then don't ask him about that. Ask him to hear it, just don't put it in the game.

2459
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:35,240
Alright.

2460
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:45,240
But, you know, all the things that we put in, you know, we kind of made themed non-stop tracks of, you know, songs that you guys would enjoy.

2461
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:54,240
You know, we have a lot of songs from the Cage Match, we got a lot of songs that, you know, you, Jamie, and Matt like.

2462
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:57,240
So, you know, it's got pretty much everything in it.

2463
02:18:57,240 --> 02:19:01,240
Just an all ABBA course for me, of course.

2464
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:08,240
Although we don't have a whole lot of ABBA in it, but, you know, we have, like, Skulk, we know you like that.

2465
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:09,240
Oh yeah, that's my favorite.

2466
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:18,240
We have Castlevania stuff for Jamie, we have a couple of Loki's remixes in there, so, you know, it's really got everything in it.

2467
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:24,240
And you know what, it doesn't just end here, we actually are planning on doing DLC for it, so...

2468
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:26,240
Oh my god, DLC, that's amazing.

2469
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:32,240
And of course this is all free, because it's kind of a rip-off of DDR in the first place, so you can't really charge for it.

2470
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:36,240
But if the listeners want to grab it, how can they get a copy of the game?

2471
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:42,240
Well, the game comes out on Christmas Eve, so this will be a nice Christmas present for all the OLAR fans.

2472
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:50,240
And it will be up on the website, in the forums, so, you know, you'll be able to download it, spread it out, give it to everyone, to your heart's content.

2473
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:54,240
That's right, spread it like a badass TD, just go out there and tell all your friends.

2474
02:19:54,240 --> 02:20:02,240
No, I, you know, and I truly think it's awesome that you guys have spent so much time on what some might view as a silly little project,

2475
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:12,240
but I kind of go, wow, the show, like, actually, people wanted to do that for our show, like, it's, I can't describe for you how neat that feels, so...

2476
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:21,240
But you know what, we couldn't have been able to do it without you guys, so, you know, if you guys didn't do the show, then, you know, we would have been just nerds hovering around a keyboard.

2477
02:20:21,240 --> 02:20:27,240
I appreciate it. Maybe that'll be the name of the, you know, the next show in the future, because, you know, all good things must come to an end.

2478
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:34,240
OLR will end someday, I mean, it might be ten years from now, but, you know, it's gonna, someday, somebody's gonna wanna move or something.

2479
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:38,240
Maybe that'll be the next show, it'll be nerds sitting around a keyboard. We'll see.

2480
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:42,240
Maybe the comic book show needs a name, probably, unless you guys already thought of one, I don't know.

2481
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:47,240
So maybe, maybe, could say, maybe that one. Giggling girls sitting around a keyboard. And a comic book.

2482
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:54,240
Alright. Anyhow, SSG 100 Matt, is there anything else you want to say about the project, or anything else going on in your week that you want to tell us about?

2483
02:20:54,240 --> 02:21:04,240
Um, nothing really. I mean, I've just been playing, uh, the new crack game that I have is Modern Warfare 2, and, you know, plenty of NHL.

2484
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:11,240
But, aside from that, you know, working on this game, so everyone can get it out on Christmas. So, aside from that.

2485
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:18,240
Alright. Well, thank you, once again, from all of us here at OLR, SSG 100 Matt, and everybody that worked on the project, all the folks you named, and so forth.

2486
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:27,240
Uh, it's a great tribute. As silly as it might be, especially to, I think, those that are going to download it that don't remember the heydays of OLR, and some of the crazy stuff we used to do.

2487
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:33,240
They're going to look at it and go, what? But, to us, we get it, and it's a great tribute, and thank you so much.

2488
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:35,240
Are there Iraqi suicide babies?

2489
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:39,240
That's an old joke. That's good.

2490
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:40,240
I can't, I can't say.

2491
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:49,240
Ah, might be the toasty thing that comes out, I don't know. Or, uh, what other, like, really, really old jokes do we have on the show? Like, I gotta go way back.

2492
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:50,240
Big Black Cock.

2493
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:51,240
Big Black Cock, that's old. Oh, man.

2494
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:53,240
The King of Iron Fingering.

2495
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:56,240
Oh, boy. Now, that's a good Embarrassing Jamie moment, just so you know.

2496
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:58,240
Yeah, but that was old, and I don't care anymore.

2497
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:02,240
Alright. She's over it now. Alright.

2498
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:11,240
But, yeah, definitely check out fans in the chat room, and everyone, check out the Orange Lines Revolution YouTube channel.

2499
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:18,240
We're posting up previews of everything, and eventually, you know, we'll post up everything that's on there, but, you know. Check it out now.

2500
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:31,240
Thank you so much, and just if you want a little taste, if I could, just real quick, I'm going to go to the YouTube channel real quick here, because I want to play, this is one of the songs that you could actually play in OLR Revolution.

2501
02:22:31,240 --> 02:22:34,240
So, actually, some of these are, oh, they've added new stuff here.

2502
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:40,240
Oh, apparently, the Happy Sky Course has a Freeze Pop song in it, because I recognize that in the background.

2503
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:44,240
Let me see here, because I wanted to play that one song that made me go, what?

2504
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:48,240
Oh, God, they actually had the video of the Like a Prayer thing there.

2505
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:50,240
I hate you.

2506
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:52,240
Where was it? Here it is. Here it is.

2507
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:57,240
This is one of the great classics you could play in this game.

2508
02:22:57,240 --> 02:23:06,240
I'm waiting for it to pop.

2509
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:19,240
So, it's like the Legend of Max, right, basically? Hold on, wait.

2510
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:30,240
Or this one, Gaianora Waternal, if it'll load. Here we go.

2511
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:48,240
Here we go.

2512
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:55,240
To someone who listens to Understation Live, that's funny. To the rest of us, we're like, what is that?

2513
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:58,240
But you all know John, so you know.

2514
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:01,240
I know. John needs to come back and visit.

2515
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:08,240
Although I have heard rumors, I have heard rumblings that the one and only Travis Donovan is considering a Sacramento visit.

2516
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:13,240
We may have Travis Donovan on this very program.

2517
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:18,240
And I could have sworn at one point he swore he would never come on Orange Lawn's radio.

2518
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:23,240
But that might have changed. It's eight years now, and we may have him on the program.

2519
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:25,240
That would be, I can't even...

2520
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:27,240
That would be like DC and Marvel.

2521
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:35,240
Seriously, set your TiVo's now, kids. That's going to be an amazing show.

2522
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:39,240
Alright, ST-100 Matt, thank you so much for the call, and thank you again for all your hard work in this project.

2523
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:40,240
It's going to be a lot of fun.

2524
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:41,240
Thank you, guys.

2525
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:42,240
Alright, take care.

2526
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,240
Yep, take care.

2527
02:24:43,240 --> 02:24:44,240
I'd love that call.

2528
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:49,240
Thank you. No, thank you. No, no, no. Thank you. No, no, no, no. Thank you.

2529
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:54,240
Alright, anyhow, if you want to give us a call and say your thanks, or let us thank you for calling,

2530
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:56,240
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.

2531
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:58,240
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2532
02:24:58,240 --> 02:25:03,240
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, so you can go ahead and give us a call right now.

2533
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:05,240
We're taking calls live.

2534
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:11,240
While we wait for some calls, since there is a little bit of a buffer between when we say things here in the studio and when you guys hear them on the feed,

2535
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:13,240
let's get some last-minute stories. Loki.

2536
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:20,240
The Sims 3 is releasing a tool to create your own worlds, so you can build your own towns in those said worlds,

2537
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:25,240
and that'll be released soon, although I don't see when.

2538
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:28,240
Alright, Russell, Russell, Thumble, Thumble.

2539
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:29,240
Hi, caller, are you there?

2540
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:30,240
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2541
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:31,240
Yes.

2542
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,240
Hi, who is this?

2543
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:33,240
It's Deathwishing.

2544
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:35,240
Hi, Deathwishing. What's on your mind?

2545
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:41,240
Well, first off, can I say an F you? Because I kind of feel like I probably should have said this instead of what I said.

2546
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:42,240
Okay.

2547
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:46,240
F you to the Modern Warfare 2 hackers. You ruined it for me.

2548
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,240
What did they do?

2549
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:57,240
This has been lately. I don't know if the patches addressed it yet, but they've actually made it where certain playlists and stuff will put you into hacked games and stuff.

2550
02:25:57,240 --> 02:26:06,240
I really like the third-person playlists on it, and I'm now getting put into 18-player free-for-all with unlimited noob tube,

2551
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:12,240
unlimited ammo with noob tubes, and then when someone gets an AC-130, it's just rapid-fire.

2552
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:15,240
130 cannon shots.

2553
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:19,240
You know what? I support hacking and cracking your own game.

2554
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:31,240
If you want to go hack Modern Warfare so that you jump to the sun whenever you jump or that you have infinite rockets or whatever, go for it.

2555
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:37,240
But when you go and force that on other people in multiplayer to inflate your EP to make you feel better, that's just messed up.

2556
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:39,240
That's not what the rest of us are paying for.

2557
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,240
It just stinks.

2558
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:44,240
Hack it to your heart's content. Just don't go online with it.

2559
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:46,240
And I also got a PS3.

2560
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:49,240
Well, congratulations. Did you get any games for it?

2561
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:50,240
Not yet.

2562
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:54,240
Not yet? Are you thinking? Well, you sent us a tweet earlier.

2563
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:56,240
I rented Killzone 2.

2564
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:57,240
And how was that?

2565
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:59,240
It's beautiful.

2566
02:26:59,240 --> 02:27:06,240
Now, you were asking us about a lot of retail games, but have you thought about any of the download stuff that PlayStation Network offers?

2567
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:08,240
That princess was the first thing that came to mind.

2568
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:09,240
Really? Did you get it?

2569
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:11,240
No.

2570
02:27:11,240 --> 02:27:12,240
Half the money.

2571
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:18,240
Oh, I see then. Well, maybe for Christmas you'll get some money or some PSN cards and you can talk about a new future show.

2572
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:22,240
And I found an old thing you guys didn't think about, an old joke.

2573
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,240
Okay.

2574
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:26,240
It's called the exclamation point.

2575
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:28,240
What?

2576
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:30,240
Fucked you exclamation points? You don't remember that?

2577
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:32,240
The exclamation points?

2578
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:34,240
Yeah.

2579
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:36,240
You have to explain, no.

2580
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:39,240
It's hard to explain.

2581
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:41,240
Never mind.

2582
02:27:41,240 --> 02:27:44,240
Hold on, where's our Price is Right losing horn?

2583
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:51,240
I think I just died a little bit.

2584
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:55,240
You don't even want to try and explain what this is? Because obviously you thought it was funny.

2585
02:27:55,240 --> 02:28:00,240
I don't really want to explain because I've been up for 32 hours.

2586
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:03,240
What have you been up for 32 hours for?

2587
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:05,240
It was my party.

2588
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:13,240
Well, it's your party and you'll make a fail call to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to. So congratulations, this fail horn is for you.

2589
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:16,240
I want to kill myself.

2590
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:19,240
Oh, I want to kill myself.

2591
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:21,240
Don't kill yourself, just go to bed.

2592
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:26,240
Oh, and Allison, the best thing, it's a 4chan meme.

2593
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:31,240
Oh, God. Did I really just let that onto this program? Oh well, I suppose it was an endable at some point.

2594
02:28:31,240 --> 02:28:32,240
Yes you did.

2595
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:34,240
Oh well, whatever.

2596
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:42,240
Where there is a dark corner of the internet to be hiding in, there lies 4chan. What do you know?

2597
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:45,240
And I hide there because I fail.

2598
02:28:45,240 --> 02:28:47,240
Alright, well congratulations on failing.

2599
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:49,240
Alright, have a good night, Death Wishing, and happy birthday.

2600
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:51,240
The worst call ever, thank you.

2601
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:53,240
They want your cupcakes, by the way.

2602
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:55,240
Oh, yeah, I have 15 of them.

2603
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:56,240
Awesome, later.

2604
02:28:56,240 --> 02:29:03,240
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. Try not to have a fail call.

2605
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:05,240
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2606
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:07,240
The best!

2607
02:29:07,240 --> 02:29:09,240
No, okay, I'm done with that.

2608
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:11,240
Did that really come from 4chan?

2609
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:15,240
I, okay, that whole thing, this is completely unrelated to why I'm calling.

2610
02:29:15,240 --> 02:29:16,240
Okay.

2611
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:18,240
This is Breslau, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.

2612
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:19,240
Oh, hi Breslau, sorry.

2613
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:22,240
I would assume no listeners know that from the screechy voice we heard in...

2614
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:24,240
Guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy.

2615
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:25,240
Just kidding.

2616
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:27,240
I hate everybody.

2617
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:31,240
I was red in the face when you were playing that, so now everybody thinks of me as this moron.

2618
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:36,240
Well, good, now you know how I feel when I saw the Like A Prayer thing on YouTube.

2619
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,240
Okay, there we go.

2620
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:44,240
No, that came, okay, my roommate just kept saying the best of the best, like, to try to troll me.

2621
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:46,240
I'm like, okay, seriously, what the hell is that from?

2622
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:51,240
So, she shows me the video, and I think it's hilarious, and I spam it all over the internet.

2623
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:54,240
So, and I got Travis good with it.

2624
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:55,240
I see.

2625
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:59,240
Any time I can troll my own co-host is a good day for me.

2626
02:29:59,240 --> 02:30:00,240
Very good day for you.

2627
02:30:00,240 --> 02:30:11,240
Now, I was actually calling, because we started a tradition two years ago on this very station.

2628
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:15,240
We called it March Madness, but now since we started in January, we just call it Madness.

2629
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:21,240
The best game of all time tournament, best 80 games of all time, square off in battle, and only one survives.

2630
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:28,240
Last year it was Super Mario Brothers 3, and I'm officially opening the vote for nominations.

2631
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:32,240
Ah, so nominations are kicking off tonight, even though it's not 2010 yet.

2632
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:36,240
Are you kicking off things a little early, DMN?

2633
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:42,240
Uh, yes, because I have so much, I'm going to have so much stress in January.

2634
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:44,240
I want to get it started now.

2635
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:47,240
Well, it's your schtick, you can do whatever the hell you want, DMN. You go.

2636
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:48,240
Yes.

2637
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:49,240
All right.

2638
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:55,240
We're changing the voting around, so there could be, like, games like Rock Band and DDR,

2639
02:30:55,240 --> 02:30:59,240
now, I know a lot of people who listen to the show are huge Be Monty fans, and that's nothing against them,

2640
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:07,240
but it's been a problem when DDR is seeded in the top 12, and Rock Band has seeded in the top five for consecutive years.

2641
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:14,240
So we're changing the formula a little bit to keep it a little bit more fair,

2642
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:17,240
so we don't see games like Rock Band get all the way to the final four,

2643
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:20,240
because a lot of people are like, this game doesn't really need to be here.

2644
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:24,240
What are you doing different?

2645
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:26,240
Or is it a top secret formula?

2646
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:27,240
It's a secret.

2647
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:32,240
I see. It's like the herbs and spices at KFC. It's going to forever remain top secret. All right.

2648
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:33,240
It's a secret to everybody.

2649
02:31:33,240 --> 02:31:39,240
So go vote on something that you're not really sure how it works, but in the end, there will be a winner that will be picked.

2650
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:40,240
And pie?

2651
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:45,240
I have all the details of submitting your vote on orangeolensradio.com right now.

2652
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:46,240
Sweet.

2653
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:51,240
If there are any questions, they can also be directed to uslmadness at gmail.com.

2654
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:55,240
I'll be putting bracket details up probably in a couple of weeks.

2655
02:31:55,240 --> 02:32:00,240
But votes are open now, so vote early, but don't vote often, because you can only vote once.

2656
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:02,240
I have a question.

2657
02:32:02,240 --> 02:32:03,240
Yes?

2658
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:08,240
My question is, why don't we just call this whole thing over and Super Metroid wins, because that is what should happen.

2659
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:10,240
You know, I agree with you.

2660
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:12,240
Super Metroid is the greatest game of all time.

2661
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:18,240
I will tell you that both years, and I will even tell you this year, it will be my top vote.

2662
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:21,240
But when it gets beaten by crap like Tetris.

2663
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:26,240
Aw, well Tetris isn't crap, but it's just not Super Metroid.

2664
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:27,240
It's not Super Metroid.

2665
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:30,240
But I also had another reason I was calling in.

2666
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:31,240
Oh, my.

2667
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:32,240
Not to promote anything.

2668
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:41,240
I actually, I have a beef with video game marketing, and since I finally called into the show and tuned in for the first time in like five months,

2669
02:32:41,240 --> 02:32:44,240
my game of the year this year was Borderlands.

2670
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:46,240
Hands down.

2671
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:53,240
But this game didn't get a lot of press, because everyone's, you know, staining their pants about Modern Warfare 2.

2672
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:57,240
I'm going to be honest with you, Modern Warfare 2 is not the best game I've played.

2673
02:32:57,240 --> 02:32:59,240
It is not the best game I've played this year.

2674
02:32:59,240 --> 02:33:02,240
It is not the best game I've played in the past five years.

2675
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:04,240
Modern Warfare 2 is above average.

2676
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:06,240
It's a good game.

2677
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:08,240
But it's not this amazing thing people make it out to be.

2678
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:13,240
The reason why it was this great thing everyone made it out to be is marketing.

2679
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:19,240
I wish some of these games that were great got more marketing.

2680
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:28,240
If Borderlands got the marketing it deserved, I think it would have, it would have sold more, it would have got, people would have liked it more,

2681
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:34,240
and the game from what I noticed really got popular by a little bit of, a little bit of marketing and a little bit of word of mouth.

2682
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:40,240
But you see games like Katamari Damacy, Psychonauts, gosh, what was the other one I had?

2683
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:42,240
Okami would be a good example.

2684
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:45,240
These games get fantastic reviews.

2685
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:50,240
And unfortunately in these days that doesn't mean anything and it's depressing.

2686
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:52,240
You know what's weird though? Sometimes it does.

2687
02:33:52,240 --> 02:33:58,240
Like I look at a game like Braid that really did everything based off of that word of mouth.

2688
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:03,240
But maybe that's the difference between download title and going to the store and drop $60 because you know.

2689
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:08,240
And one question I usually ask people when they tell me a game's good I say, well is it $60 good?

2690
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:11,240
Or is it, you know, a rental good?

2691
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:16,240
That stems from an old game on my show that Jimmy and I did on our old show way back.

2692
02:34:16,240 --> 02:34:18,240
God I don't even want to remember.

2693
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:22,240
But we had a segment called Actual Retail Price where we would name games that were coming out

2694
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:25,240
and we would say what we would actually pay for them.

2695
02:34:25,240 --> 02:34:28,240
And in some cases I'd pay more than $60 for a game.

2696
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:31,240
And in a lot of cases I'd maybe pay $40 for a game.

2697
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:35,240
Look at a game like World of Warcraft, I have paid more than $60 for that game.

2698
02:34:35,240 --> 02:34:40,240
In fact I've paid more than I care to admit.

2699
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:43,240
But Modern Warfare 2 is not a $60 game.

2700
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:45,240
It was a $45 game.

2701
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:47,240
I hate to say it.

2702
02:34:47,240 --> 02:34:56,240
But I needed to get that out because I'm sick, and Nintendo is so guilty of this.

2703
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:58,240
All I have to say is Wii Music.

2704
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:01,240
They marketed this as the greatest thing since sliced bread and it was crap.

2705
02:35:01,240 --> 02:35:04,240
But that's all.

2706
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:07,240
I'm done. It was good talking to you guys. Happy holidays.

2707
02:35:07,240 --> 02:35:10,240
No, I appreciate it. It's a damn good point DMN.

2708
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:13,240
And I think something will also continue next week.

2709
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:16,240
Next week is going to be our last show of the year and the holidays will die down a little bit.

2710
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:19,240
And we're going to get into some of these talks about not just the stuff of the year.

2711
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:22,240
In fact I kind of envision we haven't really sat down to talk about next week's show.

2712
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:28,240
But I sort of see that we're going to spend half of it talking about the year and half of it talking about the decade.

2713
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:33,240
And I think in this decade alone we've come to have to pay a lot more for our games.

2714
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:40,240
We're paying now $60 for games whereas at the beginning of the decade with the whole CD based thing we weren't paying so much before.

2715
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:45,240
I will say the first game I paid $60 for, Street Fighter II on the Super Nintendo.

2716
02:35:45,240 --> 02:35:49,240
First game I paid $60 for was Killer Instinct on the Super Nintendo.

2717
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:52,240
I do realize that cartridge based games did raise that expectation earlier.

2718
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:56,240
But CD was supposed to drop that and now it's come back up again. It's very interesting.

2719
02:35:56,240 --> 02:36:01,240
We will talk about a little more of this next week as we start to kind of wrap up the year and the decade.

2720
02:36:01,240 --> 02:36:03,240
Because it will be a slow news week. You know that.

2721
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:05,240
So more to come on that next week.

2722
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:08,240
But thank you so much GMN. We appreciate the call as always.

2723
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:10,240
And keep up the good work with Understadation Live.

2724
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:13,240
I wouldn't call it good work but we'll keep up the work.

2725
02:36:13,240 --> 02:36:14,240
Keep up the fair work.

2726
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:15,240
Happy New Year guys.

2727
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:18,240
And hey if Travis does come out here you should come with him.

2728
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:21,240
I am planning on it. We're working on synchronizing our trips.

2729
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:25,240
We might have to just make it OLRCon. We'll rent a hall or something.

2730
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:29,240
We'll rent them a Sonic Lodge and just throw ourselves a party.

2731
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:31,240
Sounds good man.

2732
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:32,240
Take care.

2733
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:33,240
Alright take care. Bye bye.

2734
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:34,240
Later.

2735
02:36:34,240 --> 02:36:36,240
That's going to do it for calls tonight. Sorry to those who didn't get through.

2736
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:38,240
But remember you can't always send us an email.

2737
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:41,240
Or you can always give us an offline call.

2738
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:45,240
Or you can always send us an email bag. Twitter. Whatever you want to do there.

2739
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:48,240
So sorry to those again who did not get through.

2740
02:36:48,240 --> 02:36:50,240
Anyhow.

2741
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:52,240
It's about time for us to wrap up the show.

2742
02:36:52,240 --> 02:36:55,240
But I know Loki might have had some more last minute stories he wants to get to.

2743
02:36:55,240 --> 02:36:58,240
But he's too busy laughing over there at the freaking...

2744
02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:00,240
Well I was laughing at some stuff.

2745
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:07,240
But I like how they have I'm on a Boat as one of the songs in there and they have the video for it.

2746
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:09,240
Nice.

2747
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:13,240
So other things we'll mention real quick.

2748
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:23,240
There's a game that was originally on the iPhone and the iPod Touch from a French independent developer called Press Start Studios.

2749
02:37:23,240 --> 02:37:28,240
And it's a hack and slash game called Twin Blades The Reaping Vanguard.

2750
02:37:28,240 --> 02:37:30,240
And it's a really awesome looking game.

2751
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:34,240
And it's now coming to Xbox Live Indie Games.

2752
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:39,240
And I think you should pick it up just because it's incredibly beautiful.

2753
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:41,240
It's all hand drawn.

2754
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:44,240
The game's coming out for three bucks.

2755
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:47,240
So definitely worth picking up.

2756
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:49,240
And it looks like a pretty fun little game.

2757
02:37:49,240 --> 02:37:51,240
Maybe I'll have to look for the iPhone one.

2758
02:37:51,240 --> 02:37:54,240
Yeah the iPhone one is actually already out now.

2759
02:37:54,240 --> 02:37:58,240
And is actually out for 99 cents.

2760
02:37:58,240 --> 02:38:03,240
This one will be coming out apparently on Christmas.

2761
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:05,240
So the 25th.

2762
02:38:05,240 --> 02:38:07,240
Sounds kind of neat.

2763
02:38:07,240 --> 02:38:14,240
Assassin's Creed 2 is getting some download content that's going to kind of bridge the gap between the first and second games.

2764
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:19,240
And they've added some new abilities including the spring jump.

2765
02:38:19,240 --> 02:38:27,240
And that's apparently two different contents between I guess the end of January and the end of February.

2766
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:31,240
They're going to have the Battle of Forli.

2767
02:38:31,240 --> 02:38:34,240
And that's going to be for $3.99.

2768
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:42,240
And also I guess the Bonfire of the Vanities which will run you $4.99.

2769
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:52,240
And I guess it's speculated that the two editions will fill in the missing sequence 12 and 13 from the game.

2770
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:54,240
So that's neat.

2771
02:38:54,240 --> 02:39:00,240
And lastly the 3D Blu-ray specs have been finalized.

2772
02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:06,240
And this is going to be kind of going forward I guess.

2773
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:09,240
I don't know if they're going to start this next year or what.

2774
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:14,240
But obviously the big trend in entertainment nowadays is 3D.

2775
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:18,240
And they're going to be kind of bringing that to you with Blu-ray.

2776
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:30,240
And one of the things that they did include with the Blu-ray specs is going to be that the 3D will be supported on PlayStation 3.

2777
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:35,240
So soon you'll be able to watch 3D movies on your PlayStation 3.

2778
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:44,240
Makes sense since they have similar technology right now available for the Avatar game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

2779
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:48,240
Assuming you had the TV to support it and had the glasses to go with it.

2780
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:54,240
But actually some of those TVs because the Avatar game supported all sorts of different methods for it.

2781
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:56,240
One of which is Realty.

2782
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:59,240
And I didn't even realize that Realty is available for TVs.

2783
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:05,240
And those glasses are dirt cheap. I mean hell you go see a 3D movie in the theater.

2784
02:40:05,240 --> 02:40:08,240
You get a free pair of those polarized glasses.

2785
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:10,240
Aren't you supposed to turn them into the bucket at the end so they can be steam washed?

2786
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:14,240
Fuck that. I'm paying extra money for the movie.

2787
02:40:14,240 --> 02:40:16,240
I'm keeping those damn glasses.

2788
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:21,240
But yes, for Avatar I did recycle them. I did have some before just in case.

2789
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:22,240
Yeah I stole one when I saw it.

2790
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:24,240
A kid did have a pair from Disneyland that I accidentally held onto.

2791
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:28,240
If I ever get a TV though that does support Realty, I'm keeping those damn glasses.

2792
02:40:28,240 --> 02:40:32,240
Speaking of 3D and Disneyland, we gotta plan a trip in February y'all.

2793
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:34,240
Guess who's coming back?

2794
02:40:34,240 --> 02:40:36,240
Oh my gosh, did you see Princess Tiana?

2795
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:39,240
I did. I was so excited to give her a hug.

2796
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:42,240
She let me pretend to be the prince even though the prince was standing right there.

2797
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:43,240
That's awesome.

2798
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:46,240
But my female friend that was with me, she posed with the prince so it worked out.

2799
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:48,240
You should have posed with the prince too.

2800
02:40:48,240 --> 02:40:51,240
I should have but there were all these little kids around.

2801
02:40:51,240 --> 02:40:56,240
I don't think the parents would appreciate those types of questions so we'll just leave it at that.

2802
02:40:56,240 --> 02:41:04,240
But no, I obviously had a good time and I'm excited to go back next year because we've got to see Captain EO.

2803
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:06,240
It's gotta happen.

2804
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:09,240
Oh you guys, Captain EO is officially coming back in February.

2805
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:10,240
Okay we're going.

2806
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:13,240
Officially has been announced. Honey, I Shrunk the Audiences is out.

2807
02:41:13,240 --> 02:41:19,240
And what's interesting, I actually asked one of the guys working there if there was any banners for the Captain EO announcement up.

2808
02:41:19,240 --> 02:41:21,240
And he said no, it's just that they made it official.

2809
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:27,240
And I was like, well you know, as nice as Honey, I Shrunk the Audiences has been, it's kind of aged so you guys probably aren't surprised.

2810
02:41:27,240 --> 02:41:30,240
And they were like, yeah we kind of knew it was leaving in a year anyway.

2811
02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:34,240
And I was like, oh really? Something about that kind of caught my ear?

2812
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:37,240
Okay and this Captain EO thing has been announced for a limited run.

2813
02:41:37,240 --> 02:41:40,240
What has already been planned for next?

2814
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:44,240
Because this means something has already been planned for 2011 for that theater.

2815
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:46,240
So Captain EO is going to be there but only for about a year.

2816
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:48,240
Then something else is coming.

2817
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:50,240
I have a theory. I have a theory.

2818
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:51,240
What is your theory?

2819
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:52,240
It's Tomorrowland, right?

2820
02:41:52,240 --> 02:41:53,240
Yes.

2821
02:41:53,240 --> 02:41:55,240
Pixar is a big thing right now.

2822
02:41:55,240 --> 02:41:59,240
I'm going to guess it's a Wall-E movie would take that theater.

2823
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:01,240
And I think a Wall-E movie would be pretty rad.

2824
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:02,240
That would be awesome.

2825
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:05,240
That's my bet, is a Wall-E movie replaces Captain EO.

2826
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:10,240
If it was my way it'd be Tron and they'd reopen the monorail and actually make it a good Tron ride.

2827
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:13,240
The People Mover, OMG, yes please.

2828
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:16,240
So much this. So much this.

2829
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:21,240
If it wasn't for that stupid guy who decided to dive off the wrong side of it,

2830
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:26,240
we would still have us a People Mover and we would still have us the Tron thing which was the only good part about the People Mover.

2831
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:30,240
I will say that. I don't want to make this the Disney show but we're at the end of the show anyway.

2832
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,240
There's not a lot left.

2833
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:32,240
I will say this real quick.

2834
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:37,240
One thing I did see at Disneyland that just opened up Friday, reopened up I should say,

2835
02:42:37,240 --> 02:42:39,240
all new, all completely redone.

2836
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:40,240
I was very impressed.

2837
02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:42,240
Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln is back.

2838
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:43,240
You know, I have never seen that.

2839
02:42:43,240 --> 02:42:45,240
It's actually pretty awesome.

2840
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:46,240
I gotta say.

2841
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:49,240
It'll get your patriotic senses tingling.

2842
02:42:49,240 --> 02:42:51,240
Like, you know, it's very well done.

2843
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:55,240
The animatronics are the part of it that's amazing because Abraham Lincoln looks fucking real.

2844
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:58,240
And he stands up and sits down and all this stuff.

2845
02:42:58,240 --> 02:43:01,240
It's like, oh my gosh, why isn't this level of animatronics?

2846
02:43:01,240 --> 02:43:02,240
Let's pick a date and go.

2847
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:03,240
We're gonna have to do it.

2848
02:43:03,240 --> 02:43:06,240
Let's hope that's not Evil Lincoln who will murder us all.

2849
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:07,240
No, it's not Evil Lincoln.

2850
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:14,240
I especially love the part when President Lincoln stands up and does his rendition of Lady Gaga's poker face.

2851
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:18,240
Starts mimicking the bad romance video, yes.

2852
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:19,240
It really hit me.

2853
02:43:19,240 --> 02:43:21,240
In the voice of Christopher Walken.

2854
02:43:21,240 --> 02:43:23,240
Nice.

2855
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:26,240
All right, anyhow, there you go.

2856
02:43:26,240 --> 02:43:28,240
That's my little snap Disney review.

2857
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:32,240
But they have water back at California Adventure.

2858
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:36,240
The main walkway at California Adventure is closed.

2859
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:37,240
You have to go all the way around to get anywhere.

2860
02:43:37,240 --> 02:43:40,240
But California Adventure, I have a cry.

2861
02:43:40,240 --> 02:43:45,240
But they really are getting that park ready for 2011.

2862
02:43:45,240 --> 02:43:46,240
It's gonna be awesome.

2863
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:47,240
It's gonna be awesome.

2864
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:49,240
Aladdin is also closing.

2865
02:43:49,240 --> 02:43:51,240
It's announced at the Aladdin show at California Adventure.

2866
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:52,240
It's gonna close in August.

2867
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:54,240
It's probably going to Broadway.

2868
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:55,240
Don't cry too much.

2869
02:43:55,240 --> 02:43:57,240
It's in London's West End right now.

2870
02:43:57,240 --> 02:43:59,240
Pam Anderson is playing the Genie.

2871
02:43:59,240 --> 02:44:01,240
Which, what, but okay.

2872
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:04,240
But a Toy Story musical is gonna replace it.

2873
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:05,240
That's cool.

2874
02:44:05,240 --> 02:44:06,240
Yeah, so we'll see.

2875
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:11,240
Well, you know, Toy Story 3 is in the works.

2876
02:44:11,240 --> 02:44:13,240
So.

2877
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:17,240
Oh, I'll say about Toy Story 3, they're actually gonna be doing an IMAX releases for that.

2878
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:18,240
Oh yeah, the 3D.

2879
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:20,240
Yeah, they did the 3D preview before.

2880
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:21,240
So, good times.

2881
02:44:21,240 --> 02:44:23,240
And, you know, again, how does this relate to video games?

2882
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:25,240
Movie, video game tie-ins, and the technology.

2883
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:27,240
Just like Logie's saying about Avatar.

2884
02:44:27,240 --> 02:44:31,240
You know, this type of technology you're seeing in Avatar is already in the game.

2885
02:44:31,240 --> 02:44:34,240
It's just that it's probably too expensive for a lot of you guys to afford.

2886
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:37,240
3D, we had Toy Story Midway Mania come out this year on the Wii.

2887
02:44:37,240 --> 02:44:42,240
And although the game was not as good as the ride, the 3D is an option in it.

2888
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:46,240
You know, this is the wave of the future as this decade comes to a close.

2889
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:48,240
It's gonna be very interesting.

2890
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:53,240
Speaking of the decade coming to a close, you know next week is gonna be all about not just the year but the decade.

2891
02:44:53,240 --> 02:44:55,240
Probably do a little bit of both.

2892
02:44:55,240 --> 02:44:57,240
I'm not sure if we'll have any special guests yet.

2893
02:44:57,240 --> 02:44:58,240
I'm gonna try to line up some folks.

2894
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:00,240
We'll see what happens over the next week.

2895
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:06,240
But we will be back live again on All Games Radio on the 27th with our last episode of the decade.

2896
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:11,240
If you can believe it, we've been doing this show most of the decade.

2897
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:13,240
That's kind of strange.

2898
02:45:13,240 --> 02:45:16,240
Well, we've hit seven years.

2899
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:20,240
I know. Next year will be the eighth year of broadcasting.

2900
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:23,240
2002 to 2010 and beyond.

2901
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:25,240
We're bored.

2902
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:31,240
Anyhow, before we close up shop tonight, of course we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts here in studio.

2903
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:33,240
So, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

2904
02:45:33,240 --> 02:45:35,240
I want cupcakes.

2905
02:45:35,240 --> 02:45:37,240
You guys and cupcakes.

2906
02:45:37,240 --> 02:45:41,240
My final thought is at the grocery store there's a box that says Betty Crocker on it.

2907
02:45:41,240 --> 02:45:43,240
It'll help you out.

2908
02:45:43,240 --> 02:45:45,240
Loki, your final thought, please.

2909
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:49,240
I don't know.

2910
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:51,240
Tiare, your final thought, please.

2911
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:53,240
Thank you so much for being here tonight.

2912
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:55,240
I'm going to borrow that top.

2913
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:57,240
Betch. Wait, wait. You've got to see the back side.

2914
02:45:57,240 --> 02:45:59,240
I'm wearing my Kelly shirt tonight. Don't be a betch.

2915
02:45:59,240 --> 02:46:01,240
That's great.

2916
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:03,240
And, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2917
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:05,240
He just said he didn't know.

2918
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:07,240
I thought he had a real one.

2919
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:09,240
He started to say something.

2920
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:11,240
I don't really have anything.

2921
02:46:11,240 --> 02:46:13,240
Okay, well then fine.

2922
02:46:13,240 --> 02:46:15,240
That's it. We're going to close up shop.

2923
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:19,240
See you next week. We're going to do it all again on our 350th decade-end episode.

2924
02:46:19,240 --> 02:46:21,240
Rob better bring cupcakes.

2925
02:46:21,240 --> 02:46:25,240
