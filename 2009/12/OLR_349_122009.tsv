14264	15366	and I, December 20th, 2009.
16107	19112	Is a leaked survey hinting at a paid PlayStation Network?
19353	21477	Home gets assaulted with new content.
21797	24542	And what video game related show will soon be on PBS?
31547	32027	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
51961	52821	I'm alright.
53422	54582	I'm a little irritated.
55042	55722	I'm sorry to hear that.
56363	56763	Not at me.
56883	57523	Did I do something?
57943	60424	Okay, I was just saying, if I ruffled your feathers, I'm extremely sorry.
61264	64385	Well, the show hasn't really started yet, so maybe at the end of the show you'll be mad at me.
64685	65045	We'll see.
67306	68147	I'll try not to, though.
68387	71548	Alright, and of course, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
71808	72028	Hi.
72268	73888	Who's chowing down on wings right now.
73989	74269	Yes.
74809	75469	Barbecue wings.
75489	76469	Been craving them all week.
76529	77110	Have you really?
77670	80191	Now the whole room smells like barbecue, and damn, I am hungry.
80751	81171	That's alright.
82488	83649	Maybe I'll get a taco after the show.
83669	84149	Well, thank you.
84309	86770	That makes me feel a lot better to know at least you're having yummy food.
87130	87950	How have you been, Loki?
88210	88790	I've been fine.
108937	110738	Game of the Decade Game of the Decade Game of the Decade
135331	136092	DarkSakura.com
155922	158163	DarkSakura is really down with the Call of Duties of the world.
178669	179029	DarkSakura
202056	207218	We played Super Mario Wii, which was pretty cool, if annoying, playing multiplayer.
207798	210299	I don't know, I just found the multiplayer aspect to be really irritating.
210899	212180	So it wasn't fun for me that way.
214040	221283	And a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, which if you ignore the whole Civil War storyline, it's actually a really fun game.
222303	223944	I hated the Civil War storyline, so...
224557	231441	I'm so glad you finally got around to that, because I know we were talking on last week's show, kind of joking, and I still haven't played this game, but I'm glad you finally were able to do it.
231461	232462	Yeah, we played a decent bit of it.
232582	233162	Cool.
234083	251413	And I played, of course, my Peggle a bunch, and some Solitaire, and Dan was showing us the whole zombie thing in Borderlands and doing the brain hunting thing.
252338	262923	And, like, it's kind of funny because the more... You have to go back... You, like, find this... One of the character's buddies who's been turned into a zombie and he's tied to his chair so you have to bring him brains to eat.
263683	265103	And he keeps asking for more brains.
265524	269065	So as you... You start bringing him, you know, 10 brains and 25 and 50.
270086	276148	And as it keeps going, the... It goes brains for the name of the thing.
277189	280090	And... But I really...
281650	283052	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
298345	305494	It's a bummer there's not a game like that on the DS where everybody can kind of do their own thing on their own screen, but yet maybe you're still working together.
306234	309138	I think it's that real element that you're stuck on that screen.
309578	310980	I mean, it's both a blessing and a curse.
313223	317488	Well, if that is it for your gaming week... Oh yeah, and I played some World of Warcraft.
318424	318804	There you go.
319205	321126	Then how about the one and only Techmaster Loki?
322247	323567	I didn't play a whole lot this week.
324228	327830	Not as much as I'd want to, finishing up Christmas gifts and stuff.
328491	335876	So I played Grand Theft Auto, Ballet Gay Tony, multiplayer.
336376	337057	Kicking ass...
338376	338997	Thank you for watching!
354383	360246	So if you just pretty much just join a, you know, ranked deathmatch game, you're probably going to get into ours.
361187	369631	And, um, it's funny because we laugh at the people that play with us because most of the time they end up dropping because we're just so intense in the game.
370052	375255	I mean, not that we're talking trash to them, we don't have microphones or anything, but we just kick the crap out of everybody.
375995	382158	Mainly, I kick the crap out of everybody, but, you know, there's a little bit coming my way, but it's funny.
382539	383099	And, um...
384790	385090	I don't know.
385390	389852	Anyways, other than that, I've played more Bayonetta, and it's awesome.
390072	392673	I like some of the stuff later on in the game.
393153	397874	You can actually buy new techniques and stuff, and one of the techniques I unlocked is like a windmill.
398334	404716	You know, like the breakdancing move, so you spin around with the guns blazing on your feet or whatever, and then she stops and does a freeze pose.
405657	406297	It's awesome.
407937	409018	This game is awesome.
409298	410158	I know, I'm so excited.
411519	411819	And then...
413103	414685	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
431803	433203	It wasn't that big a deal to me.
433444	433824	I don't know.
433944	444567	I played that game, so it's kind of like a hovercraft action game or something like that where you're blowing up other robotic hovercrafts and stuff, and it was neat for a little bit.
445248	445628	That's it.
446488	449129	But it's not something I'd consistently play.
450285	450525	Yeah, so, um...
474235	474695	I don't know.
474775	475255	It'll be cool.
505612	512374	Well, let's see, my gaming week, obviously, if you were listening to last week's show, I got that awesome FC Mobile as a gift for the holidays.
512914	517975	And I went out on a little bit of a binge and I bought some 8B games and I borrowed from the vault.
518635	525557	So I had NES games galore back at home, including an awesome purchase I made at a local games store.
525597	528818	I went to where you suggested, Jamie, and I don't know if I told you what I got there.
529238	531739	I don't think I did after last week, but I went to that store we talked about.
531759	532519	Is it your game?
532539	532619	Yeah.
532839	534661	I don't know if you want to say it on air or not.
534681	535061	I don't care.
536403	538345	I went and got Goonies 2 on the NES.
538425	538885	That's fun.
539786	541488	Which is a game I just remember.
541528	548214	It wasn't spectacular, I think, when it came out, but I think it was also underrated because a lot of people said, what the hell does this have to do with a movie?
548494	549715	But it actually was a pretty cool game.
550336	552999	I also bought Slipheed for the Sega CD, which I knew...
553479	554060	and Sylphid.
579602	579842	Good times!
590506	591506	Good 8-bit times
619736	622817	Also, as far as my gaming week goes, not a whole lot of other new stuff.
623097	625498	A little bit of World of Warcraft, a little bit of DJ Hero.
625918	627638	I played that earlier in the week and got some trophies.
627939	629899	Because I really like DJ Hero.
629959	631900	It's one of my favorite games to have come out this year.
632360	637601	And I don't understand why people are like, why it's cool to hate on DJ Hero all of a sudden.
637902	642863	Because maybe it's not selling zillions of copies like Guitar Hero and Rock Band do.
643363	648045	I mean, I think a lot of this came from those silly VGA awards that happened.
648085	648765	Was it last week?
649505	651166	DJ Hero won best music game over the Rock Band Beatles
670322	671043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
684642	686723	I would have given it to DJ Hero too, and I think a lot of people like
704069	705911	Well, you know what I say?
705991	708013	Haters to the left because you ain't right.
733203	733703	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
756138	758780	Anyhow, that pretty much does it for our gaming weeks.
758840	760081	A little bit of housekeeping tonight.
760101	761642	We have actually some big news in housekeeping.
761682	764244	First, the little yet important things out of the way.
764605	766426	If you're not following us on Twitter, please do.
766726	769188	Twitter.com slash OLR is our Twitter feed.
769548	771310	And if you don't have us friended on Facebook...
771630	772070	Check it out.
772471	775793	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio all run together.
775853	776514	Join our Facebook.
776854	780978	We're up to something like 230 friends on Facebook and that's just not even a month.
781078	781878	So thank you so much.
782219	785281	And I understand people have been spreading the word to friends and all that.
785341	792247	So thank you guys so much to everyone who's contributed to that and helping spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because, you know, we do do this show for free.
793394	796795	Speaking of spreading the word, how awesome is this?
796955	797735	The community.
798475	802496	Myself, Jamie, Matt, we have nothing to do with this, honestly.
802636	804297	I mean, we didn't help with this.
804797	806037	We didn't contribute to this.
806757	808958	But I'll be damned if we don't love this and support this.
809418	812439	And that is this OLR Revolution second mix.
813219	814319	I'm sure you guys are familiar with this.
814359	816620	It's been on the front of our site, and I think it came up last week.
817420	820601	It's this DDR Stepmania skin mix.
821021	821862	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
837723	841688	and have put them into this DDR step mania thing.
842109	849599	And I guess John or DMN from Under Station Live did all the announcer voices because, you know, when Orange Launch Radio was a station, that show was on our station.
849959	852022	So, you know, that's certainly a part of the OLR family too.
852803	853924	It's just this whole thing that...
854585	856026	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
872879	899401	VGA award winning type of game here I mean it is there's some very silly things in there I've seen some of the videos on the YouTube channel that they have I believe it's OL Revolution some of the YouTubes they have up I have to admit I've been given an advance copy of the game but because I was out of town this weekend I didn't get a chance to check it out so sorry but I did watch the videos and just looking at some of the songs that are in it I'm face palming because they found shit that I did
900422	904644	Live, where I would sing along to songs because I was that bored.
905024	908886	And that's what was funny back in 2002 when we were first learning how to broadcast.
909246	912188	Somebody saved that shit and is now in this game.
912528	913388	I mean, how embarrassing.
913408	916030	And your karaoke.
916050	917070	Your old karaoke.
917170	918291	I should not be in karaoke.
918311	920512	God, if Like A Prayer showed up in there, I'm going to die.
920552	920792	Rob.
921252	921472	What?
922813	923093	Is it?
923833	924814	Loki is Like A Prayer in there.
925233	925734	I think it is.
925754	926194	Fuck!
926475	927376	I found the video for it.
927516	927877	Fuck!
928117	929018	Like seriously?
929579	931843	I should not be encouraging people to seek this out.
932083	932584	It's okay.
933977	936800	The time that you guys wanted to do the funny stuff again.
936820	939462	Remember we tried to get me to sing karaoke again?
939963	942064	So Oops I Did It Again is in there as well.
943145	943446	Great.
944226	946728	So yeah, I'm sure we all have a little bit of embarrassment in there.
946849	948410	But okay, whatever.
948750	951633	I can look past the silliness and the fact that you know what?
951793	956317	They're doing it because somebody thought it was cool as dumb as it was.
957058	958078	And they made a game out of it.
958098	958939	And I think it's awesome.
958959	960260	And it's such like...
961561	974605	And as individuals who have been doing this for free for going on eight years now and not really seeing any money out of this, in fact, oftentimes losing a lot of money into this, that's like total reward right there.
974685	977546	So thank you guys so much to the community and everybody that put that together.
978046	982467	I understand it is coming out Christmas Eve, so stay tuned, 12-24 of 09 to Orange Lounge Radio.
985948	988009	I think they're putting the finishing touches on that right now.
988369	990190	So thank you so much to the community for putting that together.
990530	991811	We might get some phone calls on that later.
991851	996673	I know I got to tell earlier in the show about one of the developers behind it is going to call in and tell us all about it.
997013	998693	And so we'll find out some more.
999774	1002035	Anyhow, that's all I have for housekeeping.
1002975	1003375	Sort of.
1003876	1007937	I want to get into the news tonight, but first I want to talk about this.
1009918	1011919	Because this didn't make the show roll tonight because...
1013175	1017456	DarkSakura and Loki really kind of did things because I was out this weekend.
1017516	1020257	So thanks to everybody for picking up the slack because I wasn't here.
1020957	1028499	But I saw something on the internet literally in the 15 minutes I was home between the time I got back from LA and the time I came over to do Orange Lingerie tonight that pissed me off.
1028759	1031659	So obviously I didn't make the short roll because the others didn't know about it.
1031959	1038681	But I have to say something about it because I'm so angry at this that I have to say something about it.
1040072	1066917	and it has to do with something I actually saw on Kotaku but it's not Kotaku I'm mad at in fact I think they're great there's lots of great video game blogs out there that I check regularly as I'm sure most of you do and Kotaku's one of them and when I was home for a few minutes I checked the site in my reader and saw that they had just run a story about Out Magazine's Gayest Games Ever list or I think the actual name of the list is the Gayest Video Games that they've put together this list that is running on Out Magazine um
1067597	1074264	very little journalistic content to this nobody signed the article so I don't know who did it
1075545	1091372	and if you read it you can pretty much figure out why I really shouldn't be encouraging you to seek this out because this list is not only stupid but it's so stupid it's offensive I am offended by this article you want to know why?
1091812	1103798	listen to such gem excerpts such as this the gayest video games obviously I can't read the entire article because it's copyright but for purposes of criticism I can cite certain pieces of it
1104398	1106359	Super Mario Brothers makes the list.
1107099	1111800	Which they put a video of Super Mario Brothers 3, but they describe Super Mario Brothers.
1112520	1114861	Cleaning pipes and taking names.
1118522	1118902	Get it?
1119122	1122804	Because cleaning pipes is like a euphemism for gay sex?
1123144	1123864	That's so funny.
1126496	1126856	Let's see.
1127297	1127977	Moving on with this.
1128097	1128658	Contra.
1129579	1134143	Two bare-chested dudes on a mission neither can accomplish without the other.
1134543	1139868	Widely thought to have influenced Annie Prolix before she penned this short story to Brokeback Mountain.
1141890	1142711	Oh, that's so funny.
1144172	1148436	First of all, Dan's beaten the game with one guy and no continues.
1149096	1149817	So, bullshit.
1150131	1150331	BurgerTime
1163936	1164416	What?!
1164697	1167058	Yeah, BurgerTime is apparently a gay video game.
1167739	1184990	The slap some meat between those buns tagline was jettisoned for the less memorable Let's Get Cooking, but this 1982 arcade title was created as a witty and fun commentary on the closeted state of male-to-male sexuality in the early 1980s.
1185730	1186411	No it wasn't.
1187271	1189653	It's about a fucking hamburger!
1190914	1191254	Really?
1191274	1192235	Really?
1192255	1192575	Really?
1193732	1195132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1215379	1226182	sets back what we've tried to accomplish by going back to these schoolyard tactics of, well, if X and Y is true, then teehee, you must be gay because so-and-so talks with a lisp.
1226422	1227262	You're a faggot.
1227983	1230263	Do you know how many times I had to hear that growing up?
1230783	1233744	And what you're doing in this magazine article, is that any better?
1234104	1237405	Because they're bare-chested dudes going on an adventure together.
1237685	1240126	This makes this a gay video game.
1241508	1243551	I'm sorry, I find that to be offensive.
1244071	1258591	Nowhere here in this article does it talk about Dragon Age, a game where you can have a same gender relationship if you want, or not, your choice, or how about what I consider to be one of the most landmark games for homosexual content ever made, The Sims.
1260052	1262754	If you want to have a gay relationship, go for it.
1263215	1264416	If you don't, don't.
1264696	1266658	What you do in your walls is your choice.
1267079	1268540	Does that game come up in this article?
1269001	1269261	No.
1269982	1275467	Because to some junior high school graduate here, it's apparently not funny.
1275948	1281694	But putting a list of games in a blender that are apparently popular and finding... It's like...
1282622	1283382	Jake Gyllenhaal must be gay
1309218	1316505	because he bottomed for Heath Ledger or he looks good without a shirt off or whatever reason they pick up.
1317246	1325254	How is that any better from what you've faced as a homosexual man or a bisexual man or somebody in the minority your entire life?
1325594	1327877	How is what you're saying any better than that?
1328477	1330579	Because you do one thing, you must be gay.
1331584	1332744	This list is stupid.
1333364	1336225	This list has nothing to do with gay people.
1336525	1338185	It has nothing to do with video games.
1338525	1340606	It's insulting and I denounce it.
1341926	1353888	And if you are a gay man listening to this show, which I've been blessed amongst the seven or eight years to meet many gay people that listen to this show and have said many nice things about what we do here and all that stuff, you should be fucking pissed too.
1354388	1360709	If you are a straight man who plays video games, you should be fucking pissed at this because they don't know what the hell they're talking about.
1361900	1387359	and Out Magazine if you want to write about video games then hire someone who knows what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to video games and has the balls to sign their articles and has the balls to sign their article and is going to sign a check that they're asking cash no pun intended it's just ridiculous I mean my god if Cho and Niki had been on the list at least I could see that I mean I would think that's a little stupid but come on
1388783	1390004	Jamie, Loki, am I crazy?
1390024	1391004	No, you're not crazy.
1391665	1395007	Is that magazine, though, just for men, specifically?
1395107	1395847	Out magazine?
1395967	1396287	I don't know.
1396367	1397128	I don't subscribe.
1397188	1402471	I hear it's been around forever, but clearly you can understand why I'm not going to subscribe to these types of magazines.
1402611	1405433	As a woman, I'm actually kind of offended by that, too.
1406293	1414558	I believe Out is specifically targeted at gay men, but I'm sure they're not going to say no to a lesbian who wants to buy it.
1416218	1424181	I just... I think that that's completely baffling and silly that they could even pass something like that and think that it would be actually funny.
1424722	1430064	I mean, I can't... Now, if the whole list is strictly for parody, it should say parody.
1430164	1432825	And then maybe it might be remotely funny.
1433826	1440729	It still would be about as funny as... It would be about as funny as World War II.
1440849	1441549	It's not funny.
1441949	1443130	I'm trying to play devil's advocate.
1443190	1443690	I understand.
1444651	1449512	That would be the only thing that I could remotely see something like that maybe passing to be posted.
1450032	1457634	Is that they go, oh no, this is satire, this is parody, this is us making fun of other people by sort of the Colbert action, you know what I mean?
1458374	1460955	How he makes fun of Republicans by acting like an uber-Republican.
1461835	1466176	But other than that, if there's no type of disclaimer about that, then no.
1466556	1466956	I think that
1467791	1471772	In fact, actually, I would say don't just post a comment on there.
1471993	1475654	Actually, get their address and mail something in.
1475754	1476394	I'm curious to see.
1477054	1478255	Just for sake, real quick.
1478335	1481536	I know we're pushed for time tonight, but I just want to read what I said on the article.
1481756	1482736	Because you may not see this.
1483477	1485377	If you see this, then they let it run.
1485417	1486798	We'll post it up on our forums, too.
1489047	1494551	As a gay man and a long time gaming enthusiast, I find this meat compilation to be not only horribly misinformed but offensive.
1494992	1498835	Nowhere on this list are games mentioned that actually meant anything to gay representation in games.
1499175	1500456	Love who you want to love in The Sims.
1500736	1502838	Choose to have a same gender night of Passion and Dragon Age.
1502978	1503318	Or not.
1503658	1510744	Not even a freaking bone-tossed controversial gay content in games such as the hidden kiss in Bully or the lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect.
1511124	1511184	Yep.
1540501	1543624	and I'm mad because I'm so disappointed.
1544324	1545325	I am so disappointed.
1546626	1561018	I'm sure whoever wrote this article, you know, assuming they're gay, hell, assuming they're straight working in a gay magazine at some point in their life has had a stereotype passed on to them and to just turn around and post this crap in the face of that is disappointing.
1561538	1563180	It's just, it's so disappointing that I'm angry.
1564941	1568004	Out, do the right thing and renounce this article and apologize.
1568905	1569325	I demand it.
1571960	1577702	and if you demand it too, which you should, out.com and I don't know.
1577742	1579303	I could read the whole... Call for a boycott until you do.
1580063	1583145	Just go to the website and tell someone you're pissed because I know I'm pissed.
1584986	1585286	Anyhow.
1587907	1589367	Maybe I will send this letter to the editor.
1589408	1589688	I don't know.
1589728	1592229	Blackwolf says in chat I would send this letter to the editor.
1592649	1593209	Maybe I should.
1593329	1593669	I don't know.
1594490	1595890	We'll see what happens tomorrow.
1596230	1596571	Remember...
1598672	1610818	I think whether or not it's posted, you should still send it to the editor because keep in mind, what's one of the big things that I personally lead by is that if you don't bring something to the attention of someone who can do something about it, then it's just going to keep going on.
1611458	1611978	Okay, fair enough.
1612339	1612859	Here's what I'll do.
1613339	1614900	I will write a letter to the editor.
1615200	1618682	If all of you who are just as pissed off as I am will write a letter to the editor too.
1619202	1621803	I still think you should write it despite everything, but I mean, I'll write one.
1622243	1623824	I'm trying to encourage everyone.
1624485	1625465	No, everyone.
1626085	1626526	I'll write one.
1627086	1627286	Great.
1628632	1636948	Great, then we have a cause This is a much more important cause than President Cat, might I add But President Cat's pretty damn important President Cat is pretty damn awesome
1638732	1639232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1670114	1672215	Contra being an inspiration for Brokeback Mountain.
1672315	1672835	Please.
1673455	1675256	Dude, the book was written?
1675276	1680979	I think the book was probably written before that game ever came out.
1681039	1681619	I'm not sure.
1681639	1682339	I have to find out.
1683320	1684980	But yeah, it's just ridiculous.
1685220	1685821	Ridiculous.
1686821	1687642	Absolutely ridiculous.
1687982	1693244	I mean, I was in band and I played softball for a little while.
1694375	1695336	A question in the chat room.
1695356	1697918	What about bisexuals or pansexuals or asexuals?
1698398	1702581	Anyone who hates stereotypes should be offended by this article.
1702641	1708365	So if you hate bisexual stereotypes, you know, like bisexual are just bisexual because they're sluts.
1708745	1709545	That's a stereotype.
1709766	1710966	This is what I get.
1711867	1713588	Asexuals are asexual because they can't get any.
1713808	1714629	That's a stereotype.
1715209	1718073	This is the stuff that I get.
1718233	1722698	I'm married, but I've had girlfriends in the past.
1724540	1726562	It's just like, oh, you're married now, so you're not.
1727183	1728044	It doesn't change.
1729125	1731067	It just means I found someone I fell in love with.
1731307	1732809	It doesn't change anything.
1734451	1736233	I'm totally pissed off by that.
1738100	1738781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1751736	1752757	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1769025	1769225	Right, Loki?
1795296	1795616	Sure.
1795816	1797137	All right.
1797657	1798477	He has meat.
1798697	1800378	No, I was going to let you do gaming news.
1800398	1801218	I don't know if you want to say it.
1801258	1801958	No, it's fine.
1801978	1804559	I was just like, I didn't really have anything to contribute.
1804639	1806060	It's stupid.
1806360	1811161	I saw the article, you know, when I was looking for stories.
1811181	1812762	I was like, eh, no list.
1812862	1813042	Boop.
1813322	1814162	Skipped right past it.
1814582	1815863	And that's pretty much, you know.
1816954	1818195	Real Gaming News Real Gaming News Real Gaming News
1846934	1852779	Anyways, let's start things off with Out Magazine's top gay games list.
1852839	1854141	Oh wait, no.
1855222	1867112	So yes, as rumored and as we've been talking about before, the water expansion for LittleBigPlanet is going to be hitting the PlayStation Network before Christmas.
1867693	1872997	And it is coming out this week and to kind of tie with it, and I'm surprised I didn't think of it before...
1874144	1874945	Pirates of the Caribbean Level Pack
1890874	1909579	and those will be out on the PlayStation Network on the 22nd including with that will be a six pack of Pirates costumes including Jack Sparrow, Davy Jones, Will Turner and some of the other characters in the actual movie and also you get a free cannibal costume as well if you don't want to buy any of that stuff.
1909599	1914300	At the very least you get a free cannibal costume and I can't wait to buy this.
1915020	1919522	I'm so glad after such a sad, angry news item that we have something that makes me happy again.
1919582	1923744	And this makes me happy that LittleBigPlanet is still getting some love all this time later.
1923764	1925625	And I know this has been sprinkled throughout the past few shows.
1925985	1927526	Isn't it weird that this game's a year old?
1927566	1933268	And I seriously think LittleBigPlanet has come up every show for like the past month leading up to this, the release of this unpack.
1933288	1934249	And I think it's going to be awesome.
1934769	1938691	I'm excited to see how water's going to change the game, especially in the fan levels.
1938951	1942913	I mean, don't get me wrong, the Pirates levels are probably going to be awesome because the Metal Gear Solid levels...
1943533	1945394	That was some of the best bargain DLC.
1945895	1948957	It was almost like playing a new game for seven, eight bucks.
1949697	1951258	I'm excited to see what this is going to bring.
1951659	1952079	Definitely.
1952439	1955221	And it's going to be five pirate theme levels.
1955641	1960324	They're going to have four new audio tracks in there, new backgrounds, and that kind of stuff.
1961245	1965428	And I just can't wait to play it.
1965448	1966869	Seriously, this week is going to be awesome.
1968910	1971672	To kind of go with that, real quick,
1972304	1975126	A little bit LittleBigPlanet related, but not.
1975727	1980690	There was an advertisement for LittleBigPlanet accessories for the PSP.
1981431	1983252	And this is straight from Sony.
1983632	1990898	Funny thing about that is that advertisement lists the PSP 4000 on top of the PSP Go.
1991999	1992939	Huh.
1993680	2001686	So perhaps they're going to have another reiteration of the PSP coming out.
2003274	2004035	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2023689	2030391	Much like other Sony rumors, I'm going to say that probably we're going to hear about the PSP-4000 within the next few months.
2030931	2040633	That's really surprising to me because I would think with the Go, as much of a hard time as we've given it on this program, you'd think that if the company really believes in it, they're going to put all their might behind it.
2040933	2050736	But to kind of come out and say, oh, well, we're going to go back to the old design and the 4000, which implies by nature that it's like the 3000, but with some changes, just like all the other iterations before it.
2052556	2053418	and that they're going to go away.
2054299	2056722	In other words, this sounds like it's going to be a UMD-enabled machine.
2057763	2057943	Yeah.
2059906	2065893	I wouldn't be surprised if it's just something simple like adding onboard storage, because that doesn't take up that much space.
2066794	2069518	And why they couldn't do that in the first place, you know...
2070416	2081282	or someone was theorizing that they may go the route where they're going to include a camera built in to compete with the DSi so that you can use the camera support since it does support the camera.
2082143	2087286	They just never have released a camera over here for the PSP even though it's built into our firmware.
2088803	2090384	I'm reading some comments from the chat room.
2090404	2093247	First, I want to say this about the water piece of LittleBigPlanet.
2093907	2096729	Ionotropic said, whoops, where was it?
2096830	2097290	I just saw it.
2097310	2098211	It was something about the water.
2098231	2098551	There it is.
2098611	2099732	Water levels always suck.
2099812	2100513	Do not want.
2101894	2102454	You know what, though?
2102674	2105697	But think about what the water's going to do in the user-created levels.
2105797	2106838	That's what's most exciting.
2106858	2110220	I mean, because water means free movement anywhere, right?
2110501	2111401	No jumping, whatever.
2111421	2112822	It's free movement.
2113323	2116485	That could be very interesting for some of the user-created things, I think.
2116866	2117406	We'll see, though.
2119426	2122308	Toa Gak says in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com, 4,000?
2123269	2125090	Are they going to remove features again?
2125390	2127892	Even the 3,000 lost a feature, the infrared port.
2128132	2130654	Then the Go lost the UMD, so what's this going to lose?
2130894	2133916	Well, the infrared port I can understand because they didn't use it for anything.
2134617	2140461	I mean, other than homebrew, which enabled use of it, but it didn't really use it for anything.
2140501	2143643	I mean, they were going to possibly use it for a keyboard or something, but never did.
2144011	2145553	I know what the PSP 4000 will do.
2146093	2148535	It's going to finally stop piracy for good.
2149136	2150497	No, for real this time, guys.
2150717	2152098	Don't laugh, don't laugh, come on, for real.
2152138	2155661	We're going to stop piracy and homebrew on the PSP for good.
2155761	2156662	That's what the 4000 is all about.
2156682	2168493	That's awesome that you're going to do that, except that there's all these other versions of the PSP out there that people can still pirate on, and why would they buy a new system that's not going to be able to do what they want to do?
2168953	2169414	It's just like...
2170536	2179919	It'd be the equivalent of them making new currency that has all these counterfeiting preventive measures built into it, but we're going to accept the old currency too.
2180299	2182420	Then why would you try to counterfeit the new currency?
2182460	2184000	You're just going to counterfeit the old one.
2184520	2185141	It's stupid.
2185481	2186681	I like this comment in our chatroom.
2186721	2189442	Joshi16 says, when will the PSP become over 9,000?
2189682	2193503	That's a fair question.
2193523	2194564	Maybe another five years.
2194604	2195544	That's a fair question.
2196826	2198507	All right, well, moving on to other Sony news.
2198807	2208150	There's a report out there that apparently there's a survey from an online research company that has been sent out that apparently is looking at interest in a premium subscription to PSN.
2209111	2214293	You know, Sony's kind of thinking about, you know, if they ask for membership fees, they could do some extra goodies and so forth.
2214593	2223056	For example, hour-long trials for full PS3 titles, access to PS1 classics and cross-game voice chat, etc.
2224606	2229368	which apparently is still not, I always thought that was kind of there in PS3 games, but apparently it is still not there.
2230969	2242634	Let's see, also something called Cloud Storage, which, you know, is similar to what we have with Steam Cloud, which basically could be an online space where you can store saved data and then you can pull your saved games from this cloud.
2242975	2246456	So, you know, this is very good for when you're going over to friends' houses and so forth.
2247317	2252279	The survey also drops hints that they're thinking about things like streaming Netflix without a disc.
2252299	2252739	What?
2252779	2256943	Hulu support, free access to minis, premium things, and so forth.
2257303	2260687	Now, I would not read too much into these types of surveys.
2260707	2261948	You know, surveys are surveys.
2262288	2267353	They're gauging interest, and they're going to throw all sorts of possibilities out there that might not have been thought up by Sony.
2267493	2269375	They might have been thought up by the marketing company.
2269875	2275300	I mean, it's that old corporate mentality of, let's throw things against the wall and see what sticks.
2276181	2280705	So, I mean, it's not to say that nothing here is ever going to come true.
2281145	2286209	Someone with power is thinking about it, but I don't think there's need to flail and panic just yet.
2287691	2289232	Loki, DarkSakura, what do you think?
2290093	2290413	Agree?
2290493	2290873	Disagree?
2290913	2295257	Some of it will probably come true because all the Sony rumors seem to come true sooner or later.
2296158	2297299	They have laser getting leaked.
2298490	2298570	Yeah.
2298590	2298690	Yeah.
2323379	2324740	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2347352	2351594	But I guess then at the same time, you can play games for free on Sony's network, and you can't do that on Xbox.
2351614	2354576	So what might be considered a core feature one system might not be for another.
2354716	2355096	I don't know.
2355236	2364141	But I think a lot of the problems with the Sony system is that they don't have their own network.
2364341	2368043	Well, I mean, they have their own network, but they don't have their dedicated servers, basically.
2368103	2376328	It's just all... Each company has their own servers for PlayStation games, since everything on Xbox Live is basically on the Microsoft servers.
2377315	2384840	Cross chat, cross servers is going to be tough because, you know, it's all these different servers you have to go through.
2384900	2386501	I mean, I don't know.
2386521	2388662	I guess they could do it if they really wanted to.
2389747	2392368	Let's go to the chat room for some other comments on this story.
2392468	2398469	GameGuru in our chat room says, Doesn't Sony realize that their free service is the only advantage PSN has over Xbox Live?
2399549	2401830	DJ Tyrant says, I really enjoy Core, to be honest.
2401970	2403150	I heart Veronica Belmont.
2403931	2405331	There are a lot of Core fans out there.
2405551	2409312	I mean, I personally don't subscribe, but I don't think it's a...
2409912	2410412	DarkSakura.com
2437185	2439907	Yep, we have some news regarding SingStar.
2440507	2441008	My favorite.
2442248	2443589	Well, of course, I gave you ABBA.
2445150	2448713	There's a SingStar viewer application to be released.
2449193	2456738	Well, it doesn't have a date yet, but to be coming out for PS3 that has a different social networking.
2458319	2458880	You can do...
2460846	2462548	and different things with the players.
2462648	2466991	It's actually called SingStar Viewer, like I said, which would be in your games folder.
2468232	2470354	You can browse and purchase songs from the SingStore.
2470534	2475958	You can vote on videos and photos and rate stuff and it's supposed to be free.
2477279	2481923	And you also should be able to use it even when you do not have the SingStar disc in the system.
2483484	2488468	And again, not a date yet on it, but it says that it should be in the coming weeks.
2490524	2491045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2513407	2515048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2537526	2547498	Yeah, I guess, you know, and it's also kind of one of those things where I think that's where it ultimately might help drive sales is that people download this and go, oh, this is really funny, but I can do better.
2548018	2555507	My nephew can sing better than this kid, or I got an outfit that outdoes this one, so they're going to go buy the game so they can get on the SingStar channel.
2555647	2556308	It's interesting.
2556889	2557009	It's...
2558163	2564444	Certainly a selling point of the game that Lips doesn't have, or Karaoke Revolution doesn't have, or hell, even Rock Band doesn't have this.
2565005	2567185	You can't save your performances from Rock Band.
2567425	2571386	Could you imagine... Oh god, maybe this is something they're going to cook up for Rock Band 3.
2572746	2574127	Oh wow, I think I might be onto something.
2574807	2577387	Especially in this whole thing that we're getting into.
2577647	2580348	Can you imagine if Rock Band 3 had this type of...
2582055	2582876	I think that might be it.
2583076	2584277	I bet that's where they're going to go with this.
2584698	2588682	Some type of share your performance on the internet type thing.
2589062	2589783	SingStar Idol?
2590003	2591765	They're doing it the other way right now, aren't they?
2592205	2596730	Where if you're a band, put your song in Rock Band for the masses to consume.
2597610	2599672	Oh man, I bet that's what's coming in Rock Band 3.
2600313	2601835	Share your performance with the internet.
2601895	2602255	Watch!
2602916	2603236	Watch!
2606609	2613895	Right now, SingStar's got the leg up on it, but I wonder, if this thing is successful, only a matter of time before the other music games notice.
2616296	2621781	Loki, if there was a Rock Band 3 with internet connectivity, would you consider uploading some of your epic performances to it?
2622321	2623762	I haven't really played it that much, sadly.
2623782	2624042	Really?
2624683	2624983	Yeah.
2625243	2625844	Oh my gosh.
2625924	2627925	I would love to see you doing the Timmy song.
2629826	2630707	Lords of the Underworld.
2631147	2631408	Maybe.
2632929	2634610	All right.
2636168	2644594	Well, another thing that you can kind of share in would be the new Sodium-1, which is kind of an MMO, I guess, on home.
2645014	2645355	I don't know.
2645475	2648537	I apparently ignored the whole MMO part of it because...
2649158	2650458	I actually checked it out a little bit.
2651659	2656219	It's a self-contained social MMO, they're calling it, within PlayStation Home.
2657080	2661620	And you kind of go through this teleporter that's in the Central Plaza.
2662341	2665561	And you go in there and talk to this AI chick called Vicky.
2666381	2669302	And she gives you different mini-games and whatnot that you can play.
2670362	2673503	Including some different objective-based meta-games.
2674003	2678804	And they also have a full arcade-style game to play as well called the Assault Shooter.
2679844	2709316	which I thought was kind of fun but I think as you were saying it's a little bit like Battlezone I think the old Atari game I feel like I've played a game like it on the PC back when I had a 386 and I don't remember what the game was but it was one of those things that you would call up on the modem and play like oh man I distinctly remember a game it was very popular too it was the wire graphics like Battlezone but it was this whole type of thing where you were out in a field and you would shoot tanks you know like I want to say I've played this game before you know
2710516	2735591	um and then of course you get different unlocks for you know leveling up in the game apparently the uh salt shooter game that's in there only five levels are available in the game for free and you have to buy more um uh or i guess uh yeah more levels and items are unlockable through micro transactions yeah i think i would have played it up to about level five i played it only through level three before i got you know tired of doing it because i was working on some other stuff um
2736849	2738210	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2760942	2764864	Now, the drink-making game, that was kind of multiplayer.
2764904	2767426	Like, if you play as the bartender, someone else is calling the drinks.
2767806	2769988	And if you're ordering the drinks, someone else has to play the bartender.
2770408	2772229	Like, you know, there's, I guess, that.
2772269	2773170	But that's a bit of a stretch.
2773190	2774811	I don't know if I'd call it an MMO.
2775011	2779714	But what I thought was interesting about this is the way it kind of fit into the context of home.
2780214	2786738	Like, and it kind of showed off these features of home that I didn't realize were there, such as the ability to interact with what's on the web.
2787158	2789800	If you go to the website, SodiumOne.com, I think it is,
2790180	2794724	and you actually put in your PlayStation ID and all this stuff, it tracks your mini achievements.
2794925	2797627	I mean, they're not actual trophies, but they're like achievements within Sodium.
2797967	2799169	It tracks them on the website.
2799669	2800690	It tracks your high scores.
2801070	2803152	There's a Facebook app that you can use.
2803192	2812101	And of course, it's just going to... I enabled it, but I didn't enable it to publish it on my wall because I knew every time I did something in the game, all my friends would have to see it and I didn't want to burden people with that.
2813422	2814944	But it does have that connectivity.
2815444	2816165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2833328	2847233	I also thought it was interesting that you could, you know, the points that you earn in the game could go towards unlocking stuff in the home that you could put, like, if you go to the OLR Clubhouse now, there's a new table, there's some new seats, and a new little statue.
2847393	2849434	I got all that in the Sodium One thing.
2849854	2850334	So, you know, and...
2850694	2851514	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2873120	2877763	This really feels like what Home was advertised as a year and a half ago.
2878464	2882246	Games and social interaction working seamlessly together.
2882766	2891372	It's just a bummer that I feel like the game I'm playing here I played back in 1996 on a modem on my PC, but okay, it's a step forward.
2892333	2893994	You know what I mean?
2894074	2895895	It was a neat game, but it's just like...
2897523	2898364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2915805	2919427	I mean, we still don't have our trophy room with our trophies in it.
2919848	2921669	So what else do we have to look forward to at home?
2921829	2926832	Oh, the game integration and the way that it's going to integrate with the rest of the PlayStation brand.
2927172	2929053	So I see this as a step forward.
2929173	2932155	It's not a big step forward, but it was neat.
2932495	2933636	I was entertained for an hour.
2934497	2934957	For free.
2935277	2941141	I did get the water still as my creepy Santa Claus, which this time of year is very relevant.
2941201	2941461	Yeah.
2943916	2948840	One of the dollies just passed out from excitement apparently over the snooze.
2949561	2949841	Crazy.
2950622	2952343	I just don't have a very stable place to put her.
2952643	2952883	Sorry.
2954594	2957535	But anyhow, I don't know.
2957755	2959256	I'm curious to see where this leads in 2010.
2959316	2960636	I don't know.
2961296	2963437	Some folks in chat are asking about the OLR Clubhouse.
2963517	2965218	Yes, on Sony Home we have an OLR Clubhouse.
2965818	2966938	It might be full.
2967258	2968639	I think we have 25 members in it now.
2968659	2970640	I haven't even joined yet and it's full already.
2970720	2970920	Is it?
2971460	2971760	I don't know.
2971780	2973901	Try to send a request to...
2974986	2975807	and DarkSakura.com
2993109	2993429	Outro Music
3020765	3022687	Deathwishing is saying requests.
3022787	3028190	I thought I approved all the pending requests, so I will go in tonight and make sure it's all approved.
3029491	3030952	But if it's full, I don't know what to tell you.
3030992	3031613	You might be screwed.
3031653	3032013	I'm sorry.
3033014	3034775	But at least you'll have this to look forward to.
3035135	3036476	Something on PBS.
3037096	3039718	That's right, PBS, the public broadcast system.
3040339	3042480	Most popularly known maybe for the Lawrence Welk show.
3042580	3043180	I don't know.
3043701	3044761	Reading Rainbow, Rob.
3044902	3046202	Of course, Sesame Street.
3046242	3046863	Doctor Who.
3047143	3047583	That's right.
3047643	3048324	Early Doctor Who.
3048624	3050025	and a lot of great British imports.
3050045	3051346	Red Dwarf.
3051366	3052948	The public broadcasting system.
3053448	3055850	All kidding aside, you know the types of stuff they show on here.
3055870	3056631	Masterpiece Theater.
3057011	3063736	And a lot of times, a lot of orchestral concerts and a lot of things you would see at an opera house and so forth.
3064077	3070902	So it might surprise you to know that PBS is planning to record and air video games live in 2010.
3070962	3072163	That's right.
3072263	3075246	The thing that was kind of meant to bridge that gap...
3075686	3076587	Thank you for watching!
3089793	3091394	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3110609	3135483	and apparently also a DVD and Blu-ray because PBS puts out a lot of their programming on DVD Blu-ray to kind of raise money for the stations because you know they're all publicly funded and so forth so you know sales from those will go to help fund PBS so that's kind of cool for those that were looking to you know especially if you live in a place that doesn't get video games live coming there although they've gone to a lot of places you'll have an opportunity to see the show so that's pretty cool
3136997	3139358	If you're going to dress, though, dress to impress because you might be on TV.
3139999	3140779	Just something to think about.
3141440	3143061	Yeah, TigerClaw on chat says, that would be cool.
3143101	3144321	I get PBS and HD.
3144641	3147663	That's true, you know, considering we're talking Blu-ray and PBS.
3148204	3151425	PBS was like the first channel I remember seeing going HD.
3151465	3155668	I think PBS was in HD long before NBC and the other folks got on board.
3155768	3157629	So it's going to look good.
3158029	3158730	It's going to look good.
3158870	3161771	You'll get to see all of Tommy's outfit changes in high definition.
3161811	3162712	It'll be quite impressive.
3164955	3165475	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3190735	3191576	It is for adults.
3191636	3192778	It is bloody and frightening.
3192958	3193959	That was our intent.
3194900	3206834	So basically they're saying that they're going to leave it to the reasonable expectations of adults to, you know, whether or not they want to get the game or not.
3207222	3222073	I seem to remember talking about this in a previous episode and the fact that the bankers behind that game are very cold and unwilling to budge on this is that we made this game and we are not changing it and if you are not a responsible enough adult to play it, then don't play it.
3222113	3224816	But we're not changing it because you can't handle it.
3226277	3227177	I have to admire it.
3228739	3232682	They might go down in flames, but I have to admire them not wanting to budge.
3232802	3234923	Stick to them guns and make them some integrity.
3235163	3236244	Gold star for all of you kids.
3236264	3236985	No selling out.
3238553	3240936	Do you think other places have sold out, Rob?
3242017	3244620	Like other game companies?
3244961	3251488	One could claim that Valve and so forth sold out when they made those changes to get the game released in Australia and so forth.
3252109	3254772	Hold on, let me say this and then I'll go on the tangent.
3256545	3263331	is that, you know, but I don't know if that was so much selling out as it was, you know, they did what they had to do to release the game.
3263771	3266353	People in movies do this all the time.
3266794	3273339	I mean, if you think these guys are bad in the other countries, look at what they do right here in America with the Motion Picture Association.
3274440	3283287	Heaven forbid you show a vagina or a penis in your movie or you're going to get smacked with an NC-17 rating and no theater house in America is going to show your movie.
3283307	3284929	Life of Brian does not have an NC-17 rating.
3285822	3286702	And it's got full frontal.
3286903	3291445	But it's also a lot older, I think, when movies were fitting into the X category.
3292125	3298869	Or it might have still been R. I don't think that it... It was R. For some reason in the 70s, like Porky's and a lot of these movies somehow got under the radar.
3298909	3300770	But you know, in this day and age, let's face it.
3301210	3304291	A movie like Showgirls got a rating like NC-17.
3304572	3307233	Not because it was bad, but because it had a lot of tits and ass.
3308193	3309274	But heaven forbid...
3310839	3311760	I mean, it's the same thing.
3328418	3337525	and directors and so forth change their movies all the time to get down to the R rating because they know if they release it with an NC-17 rating, they're screwed.
3337585	3339026	They'll never make the money back on the movie.
3339066	3340688	The studios force them to do it.
3340728	3343270	They are contractually obliged to deliver a certain rating.
3344390	3351436	Once in a while you get those indie studios that are like, if you were releasing our unrated movie, once in a while you see those slip through the cracks, but unfortunately they don't make money.
3352617	3355058	Or you get the unrated version for a home release.
3355419	3355579	Yeah.
3358084	3384762	and some folks in chat are saying X movie has full frontal and Y movie has full frontal okay yeah okay fine you know you can show a little peen and a little vag and get away with it but you know usually you have to appeal it to get the rating and let's face it you and I you the listener and I the host can agree that the standards between violence and nudity are way different come on you can't show you can't show penetration in a movie but you can show a bullet going through someone's brain
3385563	3386684	You can show that penetration.
3389046	3389487	Just saying.
3391608	3396813	What if you fired a penis instead of a bullet and it penetrated instead of their head or vagina?
3397033	3398855	Would that still count if it's fired from a gun?
3399035	3399756	NC-17.
3399816	3401337	A cum shot is always going to get you NC-17.
3401357	3401477	Always.
3403996	3404977	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3421601	3422742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3448573	3458595	and I have to say he made a pretty damn good movie I wouldn't say you should see it if you're under 17 but if you are of age I really liked that movie I thought it was a great movie too
3460144	3463426	I like that the lady in it was in Hedwig.
3464607	3466508	Salacious Poppin' Chat brings up a good point.
3466788	3469230	They did that in Scary Movie 2, Dick in the Head.
3469730	3470530	I forgot about that.
3471351	3471751	That is true.
3471951	3473172	You didn't see balls, though.
3473933	3476734	Maybe it's not penis people have a problem with, it's balls.
3477275	3478095	It's just like breasts.
3478515	3481217	The breast is okay, but the nipple, oh my god, no.
3483004	3483224	All right.
3483765	3486807	Anyhow, let's move around the country and cover some release dates.
3487147	3488108	Things that are okay.
3488268	3489449	Oh, I'm sorry.
3489830	3490991	I forgot a tangent.
3491231	3495815	And one of our folks that works for Orange Lingerie would want me to say something about this on air.
3495875	3498437	Deekman, because he posted this to the Twitter earlier this week.
3498757	3504302	Did you hear about the Australian censorship and the fact that they are looking at – and I don't know if this is somebody running with us.
3504622	3511808	They are looking at installing basically China-like restrictions on their internet and filtering out objectionable sites, quote.
3512944	3516126	This is really going to hurt your tough man edge, Australia.
3516186	3521789	I mean, seriously, it was all about, you know, crocodile hunters and beer drinking and kangaroos over there.
3521989	3523430	That's not an internet.
3523891	3525632	And don't forget the transvestites.
3526832	3530975	But now it's just like, you know, censored internet.
3531595	3534117	I hope that just got misconstrued.
3534637	3535478	I really hope.
3535498	3537699	And Deekman posted it to our Twitter.
3538199	3539120	It was a little disheartening.
3540430	3549018	I think that any type of censorship is... The only people who I think should be allowed to censor are parents and people censoring themselves.
3549653	3555637	But if I'm not mistaking, Australia has a parliament-style government, which means they do have elected officials.
3555997	3562061	So Australians, if you're listening and you disagree with this, vote your politicians the fuck out of office immediately.
3562541	3564943	Unless, of course, they were the politicians that were against this.
3565323	3572328	But I believe in your country, you do vote, and you vote these people the fuck out that are trying to do this.
3573976	3576597	Anyhow, let's move on to happier topics.
3576657	3578217	A lot of angst tonight.
3578577	3581718	I swear I'm actually in a really good mood, all things considered.
3582739	3584059	Life is pretty good right now.
3584799	3587900	I can't complain, so I don't know why we're having such an angsty show tonight.
3589240	3590841	OLR, quit trying to bring me down.
3592571	3595953	Alright, not much coming out this week in the U.S., mainly three games.
3596193	3601555	Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3601595	3607118	That is, of course, if you didn't get it free with Guitar Hero 5 during the month of September.
3609239	3627748	Twin Sector being released on PC and finally on the Wii we have Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bears coming out on the Wii the first real good Wii Final Fantasy game That's the one that they've been advertising ever since the damn thing launched, right?
3628108	3629769	Yep, that would be the one
3631536	3632297	I am not one of them.
3646476	3650218	So now things are dying down a little bit there, but that's not to say there's nothing coming out.
3650278	3659762	I mean, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360 is getting a price reduction this week in Japan, as well as Infernal Hell's Vengeance is a new game coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.
3660382	3665545	On the PlayStation 3, it sounds like a new Hori arcade stick is coming out, but that is really it.
3665565	3671948	There's no new releases on the particular system, which, considering the games usually come out Friday over there, and Friday is Christmas Eve...
3673168	3674609	Not going to really see a whole lot, probably.
3675469	3677009	Nintendo Wii, same story.
3677810	3679490	Going over to the PlayStation 2.
3680231	3684472	There is a Neo Geo Online Collection Complete Box Volumes 1 and 2.
3684872	3686273	That is something new coming out over there.
3686973	3688974	But really, that's just rehashed old stuff.
3689834	3695276	And on the Nintendo DS, Zelda no Densetsu Taiyou no Kiteki.
3695636	3697577	Anyone want to guess what that is on the Nintendo DS?
3697737	3698757	I would say the train game.
3698857	3699337	There you go.
3699357	3700418	Stupid candle won't light.
3723786	3725066	Oops, and I got my days mixed up.
3725106	3726667	TigerClaw says Thursday is Christmas Eve.
3726727	3727987	Actually, Friday is Christmas Day.
3728167	3729428	So, sorry.
3729988	3731748	Yeah, who keeps up with Christmas anymore?
3731868	3735810	The releases are getting all messed up because of the holidays anyway.
3738290	3741471	Well, it's pretty much dry in the UK.
3741831	3743632	Just one game on the 22nd.
3743992	3746693	Well, one game came out today, Nicky Rock'n'Ball.
3747393	3750034	Well, I should say yesterday now for them because it's the 20th already.
3751724	3754928	On the 22nd is Savage Moon, the Hera campaign on PSP.
3756190	3757751	That's about it.
3772562	3784371	Speaking about Final Fantasy XIII, it did pretty well this week, including 1 million copies sold within, I believe, the first 24 hours.
3784511	3784751	Yes.
3785292	3785472	Wow.
3785492	3786513	Over 2 million copies sold.
3786833	3790776	I know they shipped 2 million, so probably between 1 and 2 million copies sold.
3792257	3799482	And, of course, that includes the Lightning Edition PS3 with the silkscreen pink...
3801803	3802545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3808433	3813296	So it's basically the equivalent of a Modern Warfare 2 here, which sold what?
3813336	3817759	Didn't they say it sold like 7 million in the first week or some huge amount?
3817919	3820000	Halo 3 sold millions.
3820020	3825644	This is kind of the equivalent over there, which surprises probably no one.
3827005	3831928	But the real question is, what will happen when the game comes out here?
3832068	3833849	Will it move a million in one night here?
3833969	3834610	I don't think it will.
3835772	3836673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3853132	3856975	Squeenix is now accepting beta applications for Final Fantasy XIV.
3857395	3861058	So if you're skipping Final Fantasy XIII, maybe you are looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.
3861378	3864701	That's right, the applications are now open for the Final Fantasy XIV beta.
3865021	3866963	Please note, this is only the Windows edition.
3866983	3875369	They're not doing, it looks like, what they did on the PlayStation 2 for Final Fantasy XI, where they actually were shipping hard drives to people to beta test that, and they could keep them as a thank you gift.
3876050	3876990	Uh-uh, not the case here.
3877471	3880253	You will have to sign up for only the Windows version, at least for right now.
3880433	3885117	I just don't know if I'm honestly, I hardly have time to play World of Warcraft and Star Trek Online's coming out
3910077	3911178	I know, I'm in the same boat.
3911218	3916544	But seriously, I will push World of Warcraft to the side for a little while to focus on this if it's good.
3916924	3923151	If they've learned from their mistakes from XI, which I still think XI was a solid game for its time, it just didn't age well.
3923231	3930899	I think if they really have combined the best parts of that with the best parts of World of Warcraft, this game could be pretty awesome.
3931239	3932501	So I want to check it out.
3933877	3938041	Anyhow though, just so you know, you need to be 18 years old in order to apply.
3938681	3948110	You have to be fluent in English, which if you're listening to this show, I'm assuming you are, or you could be fluent in Japanese, French, or German, because I know we do have some listeners in Japan and even some of those other countries there.
3949391	3954636	And apparently though, a PS3 one will come out later, it's just that right now you can only sign up for the PC version.
3955336	3979015	also no MMORPG experience required but I will tell you since I did sign up be prepared to fill out a little bit of a questionnaire about your gaming experience which is translated from a Japanese version you can kind of tell but yeah let us know if any of you OLR people get in let me know so I can be jealous especially if I don't get in this would use my play online ID right?
3979095	3981898	no it doesn't I think they're going away from play online
3982642	3983202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4010421	4011021	Great pick.
4011061	4012261	I'll have the music here shortly.
4012462	4014862	Firefox had to reboot, so I'll get the music here in a moment.
4015482	4026385	Well, the game originally came out in Japan in 1987 for the Famicom Disk System, as did the third one, too.
4028486	4029706	It came out in the U.S.
4030366	4031847	in cartridge form in 1988.
4032347	4036528	It's a little bit of a different...
4038018	4038418	DarkSakura.com
4060405	4066891	You do have to buy items, which you'll need to get to different areas.
4066931	4067792	You have to get hearts.
4069694	4071635	And you can also buy new whips as you keep going on.
4073237	4075078	You have an experience rating system.
4076019	4079883	So your experience rating increases, of course, as you collect hearts.
4080844	4086649	And that's actually something that made it into Dracula X. Not Dracula X, but Symphony of the Night, if you'll remember.
4087185	4115695	and as you can probably hear there a little bit of I did get the music to come up so of course Castlevania 2 who did not love the music in this game now we have some of the music playing in the background that's right but anyway I'll listen to it for a little bit easily one of the 10 best songs ever in a video game easily yeah
4116625	4126249	Um... Anyway, the whole point of the game is that you have to go to different mansions to find different parts of Dracula's corpse and then the magic cross.
4126929	4135352	So, um... You can actually use the different body parts as power-ups, kind of, like the rib bone is a shield.
4136073	4136913	And then, um...
4139425	4142970	Once you get everything, you can clear the blockade to Dracula's Castle and fight!
4144211	4151961	So yeah, it was directed by Akamatsu, who also did Castlevania III, and...
4154716	4161138	It had a password system for the US version as opposed to the save system that Famicom Disk System had.
4161178	4162158	You know, like, side bike?
4162718	4164038	Hello?
4165059	4167699	There's also some pretty crazy English in the game.
4168880	4171240	Like, uh, naming Simon Simmon.
4172020	4172621	Like with two M's.
4173441	4173861	And, um...
4177856	4188001	There's, you know, of course, the music in it was done by Matsubara Kenichi, who did the Castlevania Arcade, the Haunted Castle.
4189022	4192943	And they also used some of that for Simon's Quest.
4196045	4197226	It also has...
4200770	4205132	The different parts of the game, you know, the statues and things, crying blood.
4205952	4208073	So, lots of cool stuff going on.
4210655	4214156	Also, it actually, the game caused some controversy in the U.S.
4214196	4214996	with Nintendo Power.
4216477	4225181	It was the second issue of Nintendo Power that had the Simon's Quest cover, and it was also with Howard and Nestor, if you remember Howard and Nestor.
4226642	4227302	But the...
4229406	4230967	The cover apparently scared children.
4232848	4234169	So, caused a little problem.
4234449	4236811	I got in trouble in grade school over this magazine.
4237071	4239012	It had nothing to do with the cover, actually.
4239052	4242255	It's just that I brought it to school one day, and I was trying to show a friend of mine during class.
4242575	4243696	The teacher was pissed at me.
4244396	4247358	But I was so excited, because it was Castlevania II, and it was awesome.
4247998	4248299	Yep.
4250200	4252702	Um, also, uh, with this...
4253868	4254649	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4271408	4278114	Certainly this game was so different from the first Castlevania that you already kind of started splitting up the series in a way at this point.
4278614	4288282	But I just have to say real quick, it was very interesting in the 8-bit era how deviant sequels were of the original.
4288843	4290644	Like you think about Super Mario Bros.
4291004	4292446	2, way different than the first one.
4292466	4293006	Super Mario Bros.
4293026	4294027	2 was a different game.
4294187	4300429	I know, I know, but still, our perception of it as kids, you know, not knowing this whole Japanese stuff, was way different here.
4300749	4302689	You know, Castlevania 2 was really different.
4303009	4304790	Mega Man 2 was kind of different.
4304890	4308771	You know, a lot of sequels in the 8-bit era were really different than the original game.
4308791	4310552	I can't say that Mega Man 2 was at all different.
4311632	4320074	Each of the Mega Man games on the NES just kept adding different things and changing different, but they all pretty much kept the same formula.
4320154	4322635	Even the X series kept the same formula.
4323996	4333821	I can't really say that those weren't too different, but in this case, this one is a fairly big departure from how the first one went.
4334241	4341785	But then what was also particularly weird about this and Super Mario Bros., I guess you could say, is that they both went kind of back to the formula of the original in the third game.
4342485	4346927	Although Super Mario, debatable, but Castlevania definitely went back to kind of the formula of the first game.
4346947	4351429	Keep in mind, Super Mario 2 in Japan was what we got as the lost levels.
4351589	4352030	Sure, sure.
4352110	4352730	And it was...
4353214	4355096	Just like the first one, only harder.
4355576	4357758	And he had the poison mushrooms and stuff.
4358458	4358879	So, yeah.
4360000	4367586	I think Mario, actually, if you look at it with the actual successors to the original, that one kept the same formula, too.
4369808	4371970	I have to say real quick from chat, because this is a really good point.
4372030	4377875	Blackwolf, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, says, The platformer in Retro Game Challenge was different in all three versions.
4378255	4380417	Even in that game, they made the sequel so different.
4380477	4381518	That's kind of like an inside joke.
4383516	4407075	Well, at any rate, something that might be interesting to other people, this is from an interview in 2002, is Igarashi Koji, who is like one of my video game heroes and who I got a hug from, I'm so happy, actually was talking about considering a compilation of the NES titles for, I suppose, either Game Boy or PC, so...
4408081	4408982	I love this music right here.
4409002	4411963	That's the very first song you hear when you press start.
4435061	4440426	If nothing else, just like one of the best music game soundtracks you will ever hear.
4440767	4443950	You know, I do have to say there is a Castlevania game that has a better soundtrack.
4445251	4454159	But in my opinion, it's Dracula X. Not just because it was Red Book Audio, because I actually like the process, the music on the SNES version better in some cases.
4455140	4457843	But it did have some fantastic mixes of the songs.
4458928	4463810	So, but I'd have to put this up there, at least as far as the NES titles go.
4464531	4465951	That one's probably got my favorite music in it.
4466792	4467152	Interesting.
4467232	4473535	Our other pal, Bress Lowell, in chat, who, of course, is a co-host on Understation Live, says, Simon's Quest is actually my least favorite Castlevania game.
4474115	4478137	Now, if you want to see something really funny about Simon's Quest, just look for the Angry Nintendo Nerd.
4479137	4479317	Yeah.
4480037	4483199	His version, his description of it was fantastic.
4484482	4491606	I have to say my least favorite Castlevania game, and I know this is one of your favorites, Jamie, but Castlevania V on the SNES was ruined for me.
4492147	4492227	V?
4492427	4493568	Well, right?
4493588	4499792	Because it was supposed to be the port of Dracula... It came out as Dracula X. Didn't they call it Dracula V?
4499812	4507977	No, they called it Dracula X. I thought in a magazine it was like Castlevania V. I've got the box, it says Dracula X. But I just thought at some point, I remember referring to it as Castlevania V, but...
4508932	4511673	It did come out after Super Castlevania 4.
4511853	4512093	Right.
4512533	4519936	But it was so... Yeah, no, it was really... I would have to say neutered.
4520536	4526518	It was a castrated version of Dracula X. Rob, you're going to have to come over some night and just play through Dracula X with me.
4526858	4527718	It'll be fun.
4527858	4529018	On the Neo Geo.
4529038	4529899	We'll have to put a feed up.
4532233	4533514	Rob playing as Maria.
4534034	4536016	La la la, la la la la.
4536076	4537116	One of her attacks is singing.
4537617	4537817	Nice.
4538057	4540418	And she sings badly that it kills like everything around her.
4540558	4542179	And her little thing is la la la, la la la.
4544721	4548423	Also, you're forgetting, I think Breslau might be neglecting a Castlevania Judgment.
4549564	4549964	Huh, what?
4550424	4551485	The fighting game on Wii.
4551605	4551825	What?
4552265	4552946	I don't, what?
4553146	4553486	Oh, I see.
4553506	4554787	That doesn't exist in your universe.
4554927	4555167	I see.
4556786	4558127	Maybe Castlevania 64?
4558967	4559768	Oh, snap!
4559808	4562089	That's right, Breslul, Castlevania 64.
4562129	4562970	I think Loki wins.
4563450	4564571	That was pretty bad.
4565311	4567633	That was definitely a low point in the Castlevania series.
4568093	4571035	Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.
4571055	4572096	We're going to take a quick break, though.
4572136	4575678	We'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so please stay tuned.
4575718	4576759	We will be right back.
4582915	4583636	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4604534	4609916	We've had some rants and stuff, and I got angry earlier in the show, but obviously I saved this for later in the show.
4610016	4611517	It turns out I might be wrong.
4611897	4612837	I might have been wrong.
4614098	4617199	And I don't like to admit when I'm wrong, but apparently I was wrong.
4618380	4620961	And it has to do with Avatar, that movie that came out.
4620981	4624562	Remember I was coming out here saying, oh, this movie's probably going to bomb.
4624642	4626363	No one's going to fucking care about Avatar.
4627483	4629424	It was a 70-something million at the box office.
4630837	4631678	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4648541	4649541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4679372	4680533	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4702888	4703508	Thanks for watching!
4725134	4725655	Thanks for watching!
4746118	4748060	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4763217	4765339	Walk over to get my salt, what is there?
4765999	4766659	A butter pump.
4767040	4770642	Yes, you can put as much fucking butter on this popcorn as you want.
4771002	4779008	And, not only that, they have the season, you know, the different season popcorn toppings that normally at the UA would charge you to get a little, like, container of it.
4779208	4779568	All free.
4781049	4782090	Unlimited butter on this thing.
4782150	4784191	I was like, oh my god, this is the greatest theater ever.
4784411	4786053	Oh my god, all you can eat butter?
4787494	4787954	Exactly.
4789244	4790965	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4814372	4816313	Is that the directions?
4816653	4818514	Like, you know how they have directions on how to wash your hands?
4818534	4819414	Oh, there was no directions.
4819494	4820415	It just said topping.
4820535	4822035	It did not say butter topping.
4822216	4823176	It just said topping.
4823456	4825857	I'm like, well, this could be, like, anything.
4826758	4829699	Yeah, there's some people in chat saying, this isn't news, Loki.
4829759	4830639	My theater does that.
4831080	4833581	Well, none of ours do, so it's news for me.
4834901	4836562	Now, here's the ultimate question.
4836642	4838043	Was there bacon seasoning?
4838883	4840724	Not that I'm aware of, but, you know...
4842245	4843145	Steps, baby steps.
4843185	4843766	I see, I see.
4843826	4845046	It's a step in the right direction.
4845647	4847147	Let's not bite off more than we can chew.
4847427	4848908	And bacon salt's not that good.
4849008	4849508	Trust me.
4850329	4854791	You know, as cool of a concept as bacon salt is, it does not taste like bacon.
4856127	4856787	Alright, anyhow.
4857687	4861589	Let's move on with some more topics tonight, some other news stories.
4862069	4863469	I just had to say that about Avatar.
4863489	4868571	You know, I can man up and admit when I was wrong, and I may have been wrong about Avatar.
4868591	4872772	I can't say I was wrong about Avatar because I haven't seen it yet, but I may have been wrong about it.
4873732	4874072	We'll see.
4874152	4874792	It's pretty good.
4874812	4876513	I'd go see it in the theater and in 3D.
4877748	4906338	you have to see it in 3D I will see it in 3D I promise but I also have to see Princess and the Frog because I did get to meet Princess Tiana this weekend and she's mighty fierce and I heard some of the songs from Princess and the Frog in the little street show they do I really want to see Princess and the Frog so that's at the top of my list then maybe Avatar if my mom doesn't drag me to see Precious on Christmas which is likely how about some gaming news less movies more games yes
4908042	4911323	So I guess we got some rapid fire news to go into here.
4911803	4912043	Sure.
4913103	4919284	Starting things off, Dead or Alive is coming to the PSP, but not what you might think.
4919364	4925846	Dead or Alive Paradise, which is Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, minus the volleyball.
4925966	4932087	So it's just Dead or Alive giggling girls in bikinis jumping around, watching their boobs move.
4932887	4934868	to music the game.
4936208	4938129	So, that's awesome.
4939609	4940330	Thank you, Tecmo.
4940530	4943431	Why don't they just call it Boob Physics the game?
4944691	4945691	Because that would be offensive.
4946171	4946672	Oh, I'm sorry.
4947732	4951553	But yeah, so it'll be coming out Spring 2010 and it's awesome.
4952614	4953794	That's innovation right there.
4953974	4954314	PSP 4000?
4954374	4954554	No.
4954574	4954714	That.
4957281	4977290	Speaking of fake boobs, Playboy has done their annual Girls of Video Games, their 2010 spread, and this year they'll be featuring women from such games as God of War, Crimecraft, The Saboteur, Dante's Inferno, Mafia 2, and Heavy Rain, including some characters I don't know because I haven't played those games yet.
4978651	4979471	Skylar, St.
4979531	4980832	Clair from The Saboteur...
4983396	4988501	Madison Page, I guess the main character from Heavy Rain, is new in there as well.
4988541	4997611	So if you want to see some fake naked boobies, I guess, then pick up the January-February issue of Playboy.
4997631	4999373	So now they're skipping months in Playboy?
4999513	5000774	I mean, has it come down to that?
5000794	5001735	Is it bi-monthly now?
5002235	5002556	I don't know.
5005267	5015154	I still don't understand the idea of buying Playboy for video game rendered characters, but I suppose either way you buy the magazine, the girls are fake.
5015314	5020497	They have Tara Reid on the cover, but I bet you she's not topless, even though she's a slut.
5022058	5025460	Would it be bad if I said, yeah, she is topless because I saw the pictures?
5026841	5027662	Okay, well, awesome.
5027742	5030824	But still, that's not like... I don't know.
5031672	5033873	It's about as real as the video game magazine spread.
5033913	5034494	I'm just saying.
5034654	5035154	I'm just saying.
5035934	5040357	And finally, this Thursday, we're going to be getting some wonderful holiday treats as well.
5040877	5052703	On the 22nd, not only will we be getting the download content for LittleBigPlanet, which is going to be all sorts of awesome, but we'll be getting the Gran Turismo 5 Time Trial Challenge.
5052803	5057345	Of course, if you have a Japanese account, you can download that right now, and it's in English.
5058146	5058286	Um...
5058946	5087499	Puzzle Get In which I think came out last week on the Puzzle to Destroy All Puzzles Puzzle Get In Puzzle Get In Let's see, also there will be of course Guitar Hero 5 songs High Speed Soul by Not A Surf, Sister Jack by Spoon, Cut Your Hair by Pavement and the Indie Rock Track Pack featuring all three of those as well um
5089036	5093780	And then, of course, the download content, which is really the most important thing.
5094080	5098364	The PlayStation 1 Classic, though, this week is going to be Final Fantasy VIII, and that's pretty awesome.
5098724	5099105	Woohoo!
5099725	5102507	So, that'll be coming out on... Wait, Final Fantasy VIII?
5102768	5102948	VIII.
5103068	5103388	Never mind.
5105090	5106391	Hey, it's not Final Fantasy IX.
5106411	5107672	I thought they just skipped ahead to IX.
5108263	5109904	No, no, no, Final Fantasy IX wasn't that good.
5109924	5111466	I thought we ignored that VIII happened.
5111546	5112466	Listen, I liked VIII.
5112486	5113828	I liked VIII.
5114348	5115349	I'm just being dramatic.
5115369	5118571	Except the last disc bored the crap out of me.
5118892	5119912	VIII had a good story.
5120153	5121854	Y'all know how I feel about the battle system.
5121894	5124416	If you don't, I've ranted about it like 50 times in the history of this show.
5124456	5126178	I got so tired of seeing Mob Bros.
5126978	5130941	Seriously, I was like, they could not have come up with a better name for this stupid, ugly creature.
5131001	5132383	And then, of course, some PSP minis.
5132443	5137747	Hercules, Chariot Racing, and Spot the Differences is the other game.
5138823	5140504	Wait, hold on.
5140884	5142045	Spot the Differences?
5143766	5144646	That's the name of the game.
5144786	5145747	Spot the Differences.
5146927	5148528	Do I even need to crack a joke here?
5148668	5150329	I mean, the jokes write themselves.
5150349	5151730	They have the PSP 2000 and the PSP Go.
5151870	5153151	It's like, what, one's crap?
5153431	5153651	No?
5154751	5155772	Spot the Differences.
5159141	5168387	That'd be awesome if we could make a game like that and just like completely obvious differences like, you know, one's a puppy, one's a Hindenburg disaster, you know, this ridiculous stuff.
5169407	5172249	That'd be sweet.
5172269	5173470	Puppy's less violent, right?
5173590	5173790	No?
5178493	5181875	One's a picture of Brittany Murphy, one's a picture of Heath... Never mind, I better not go there.
5181995	5182295	All right.
5183530	5184170	She's a chick.
5185891	5187331	She didn't die from a drug overdose.
5187411	5188271	Oh, wait, no.
5188391	5189292	That's not probably it.
5189672	5190192	Moving on.
5191552	5192252	She was the Joker.
5194293	5194453	No.
5196793	5198094	I found something else I was looking for.
5198974	5201575	Oh, I thought you found the differences we were talking about.
5201615	5206456	No, I found something for you, Rob, that I wanted you to play during break and you didn't, so you have to play it after the show.
5206994	5207754	DarkSakura.com
5219910	5222531	Sucks for her family I don't care The end
5248444	5249785	Does Tara Reid sing any music?
5250386	5251087	You can put her in there.
5251467	5251867	I don't know.
5252888	5253229	I don't know.
5255911	5256232	Anyhow.
5259855	5262478	It's like just suddenly the Hindenburg disaster.
5262678	5263499	Wait, hold on, hold on.
5263519	5264780	Can you spot the difference?
5265621	5269204	Tonight's program, Hindenburg disaster.
5270706	5272007	Can you spot the difference?
5275379	5277360	Deathwishing might have found it in chat.
5277420	5281103	It said, pro tip, Hindenburg powered by puppies with cute kitten pilots.
5284085	5285005	I want a picture of that.
5285966	5286666	Alright, anyhow.
5287627	5288187	Moving on.
5289548	5293151	Can we get in some more last minute, or not last minute.
5293591	5294872	See, I want the show to be over.
5296793	5321330	Oh Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob Rapid Fire Topics Hey, there's a game called Zero Day Attack in Earth Coming to Xbox Live Marketplace on December 23rd That's right, Martians invade the Earth, shoot them up, bang bang, blow up Not the type of game that Square Enix is usually known for But, here's the kicker about the game It uses satellite photography So if you want to blow up real things Have a blast Just don't
5322281	5323882	Thanks for watching!
5342011	5346816	This might be... I can just see horrific YouTubes coming of this game.
5346836	5347556	That's all I'm saying.
5347596	5350059	Horrific YouTubes even worse than the joke I told earlier.
5351000	5351300	Anyhow...
5352972	5358496	And if you were offended by my earlier joke, I have to say to you, well, excuse me, Internet.
5358996	5366561	That's right, that old catchphrase, excuse me, princess coin from the Legend of Zelda cartoons, which used to run as like the Friday special on the Super Mario Bros.
5366581	5367102	Super Show.
5367822	5374627	And if you're kind of younger, you probably don't remember this unless you kind of seen it in a nostalgia post or whatever.
5374667	5376448	But I certainly remember this from when I was younger.
5376788	5379090	I bet a lot of our listeners remember this because I think I was around like 10.
5379670	5381371	So a lot of our listeners, you know, 5, 6, probably or 10.
5381411	5381812	On Fridays?
5383348	5388371	Yeah, they would have the Zelda cartoon on Fridays, because the rest of the week was Mario cartoons, but Friday was Zelda cartoons.
5388431	5394114	Well, those came out on DVD a while back, and if you bought those, well, it sucks to be you, because they're all free on Hulu now.
5394755	5405221	So if you want to see these cartoons and what they're all about, if you just want to see the lols that is this, although I will say this, this was definitely a step above the Phillips CDI cutscenes.
5405721	5407062	Those were just...
5408103	5408503	Wow.
5408823	5410304	It's like I drew in paint.
5410805	5411145	I know.
5411885	5412526	Those were wow.
5412546	5417869	Those are not available on Hulu, but the Zelda stuff is now on Hulu.
5418490	5422092	If you want to relive your youth or have another youth, I don't know.
5422472	5424513	Anyhow, also in
5425774	5426894	Thanks for watching!
5445640	5445740	G.O.G.
5471218	5472159	That would be something completely different.
5472179	5473580	The way that you said it, I thought you said photography.
5473640	5474680	I can't speak tonight.
5474740	5475361	I don't know what it is.
5475601	5477182	Rob can speak good.
5478723	5479764	I might need to see a doctor.
5480284	5483506	Alright, anyhow, DarkSakura, do you have some rapid-fire news for us?
5484306	5486148	I guess I do, Rob.
5486848	5488489	Well, don't make me twist your arm or nothing.
5490130	5491491	You didn't bring us cupcakes, by the way.
5492992	5494213	Well, boo-hoo, I'm sorry.
5495621	5498983	At any rate, how about some more stuff for the iPhone?
5499524	5514574	There is Need for Speed Shift coming out for iPhone for $9.99, 20 cars, 18 tracks, tilt functionality, which means lack of functionality, and you can play over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
5515054	5515714	That's pretty cool.
5516895	5517916	Although I'm kind of...
5519790	5520271	Thanks for watching!
5541599	5547562	I totally actually really dug the last Ridge Racer that came out on iPhone, even though I didn't play it too long because I did get a little pissed off.
5548162	5550443	So, um, give it a go, let us know what you think.
5551003	5551984	Also, um...
5553880	5560725	One other thing, and this has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with Rock Band because it's about Rock Band.
5561525	5567349	The holiday lineup for Rock Band Weekly is going to be Weezer.
5569691	5574354	We also have songs from Limp Bizkit, The Offspring, and Yellow Card.
5575214	5579177	And don't forget, Rock Band Unplugged download content is on hiatus.
5581192	5584835	So here's what we're looking at for the Weezer pack.
5585335	5590579	We have Beverly Hills, Let It All Hang Out, and if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.
5591360	5595463	And then Limp Bizkit, Build a Bridge, The Offspring, A Lot Like Me, and Yellow Card Ocean Avenue.
5596184	5599266	The latter three will be 160 points.
5599326	5604070	The pack for Weezer is 440 or 160 for each, again.
5604951	5607293	And they are also available for LEGO Rock Band.
5609875	5610295	The End!
5610876	5617020	I was going to say that Reduce is pretty awesome to be coming to the iPhone, but it's no Daytona.
5623044	5625125	Moving right along into other topics tonight.
5625405	5626886	Hey, how about some Twitter topics?
5631509	5635212	Every week we request your ideas and suggestions for topics over Twitter.
5637342	5640005	TigerClaw305 sent us this article about Gamers attempt to catch every Pokemon in 72 hours for charity.
5652919	5656562	That's right, some very bored gamers have... No, it's for charity, you can't say that.
5656862	5663248	But some gamers have decided to catch every Pokemon in existence, 493 of them to be exact, in 72 hours!
5663988	5664989	It's all for charity.
5665029	5670073	It's actually not for Child's Play, as a lot of these recent marathons have been for, which is obviously a great charity.
5670374	5672075	This is for a different one, it's called Allie's House.
5672155	5680022	It's an Oklahoma-based children's cancer foundation that provides support for families with medical expenses, short-term housing, and other types of needs.
5680523	5682307	I want a charity that involves killing sims.
5691088	5692649	There might be an idea for a marathon there.
5693249	5695690	Put up a proposal, Loki, and bring it to the show.
5695730	5696310	We might do this.
5697310	5702872	TigerClaw also sent us a quick link to an article that Blizzard will definitely work on a console game at some point.
5703812	5708834	So, in other words, not StarCraft Ghost, but like for real this time, some type of console game.
5709234	5711035	Well, really, I think the title of this says it all.
5711215	5712975	You know, they've done so many great PC games.
5713455	5715076	Maybe it's about time for them to do a console game.
5717142	5720545	And they just wanted to clarify, I don't see the PC market as being bad.
5720625	5722707	We didn't have 12 million players 10 years ago.
5723087	5726751	Whatever the format, console or PC, I think if there's a good game, it's going to be played.
5727171	5729153	We're working on PC because it's familiar to us.
5729793	5732996	Console, we have to worry about those unfamiliar things.
5735679	5739542	Also coming to us from Twitter, from Deathwishing, three questions from Deathwishing.
5739883	5742004	Should I buy LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year?
5742970	5745953	Yes, if you like platformers like Mario Brothers, yes, yes, yes.
5745993	5746794	I think it's a great game.
5746854	5748555	It was my game of the year, the year it came out.
5748956	5754921	Plus, you get the beta for Mod Nation Racers, so you gotta act quick, because that just started on the 18th.
5755922	5758825	Socom Confrontation, I guess.
5759025	5759545	Is that a game?
5759785	5760406	Confrontation.
5760486	5761047	Confrontation.
5761307	5761947	He spelled it wrong then.
5762008	5762868	Confrontation.
5763749	5765570	And did you guys try out Dante's Inferno?
5766091	5767772	I did not try out Dante's Inferno.
5767892	5768933	I downloaded the demo.
5768953	5770674	I haven't played it yet because I was gone all weekend.
5770734	5772315	I've heard it's pretty terrible.
5772635	5773636	I've already played God of War.
5773656	5773976	Thank you.
5775217	5776017	Have you checked out the demo?
5776438	5776998	No, I haven't.
5777658	5778699	I've heard it's pretty bad.
5779360	5780781	But we'll see.
5780821	5783763	Again, I don't like to base games purely off the demo.
5783883	5788186	It's got a level of... Well, it's going to be good.
5788766	5789466	I'll probably play it.
5789546	5790107	But, you know...
5790936	5792117	I like Conan the Librarian
5815933	5816273	Fair enough.
5816333	5816673	Good deal.
5817474	5819175	GamerGirl sends us a tweet.
5819215	5820896	What's your take on Final Fantasy XIII?
5820996	5821996	Good or not so good?
5822656	5823177	Couldn't tell you.
5823197	5824157	I didn't import the game.
5824177	5827019	Don't want to pay those types of fees when the game's coming out here in a few months.
5827339	5829140	It's like $100 since it's in Japanese only.
5829380	5831661	I can't justify doing that.
5831821	5839625	But the demo we played a few months ago and... The demo was fun, but once again, you know, I played the demo a few times and I'm like, why did I buy this?
5840486	5840726	Whoops.
5841377	5841817	That's right.
5842018	5843579	But that wasn't anything about the game.
5843619	5846602	It's just why did you spend so much money on a demo?
5846662	5851187	It's like, okay, I don't know what's really going on here.
5851267	5851607	Let's see.
5851627	5852488	Look at some other tweets.
5852528	5856532	A couple things of stuff that we did earlier in the show and that is basically it.
5856592	5858053	So thank you guys for your tweets.
5858233	5859595	Again, we'll take some more next week.
5859655	5863459	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.
5864359	5865621	Meanwhile, back to some more news.
5866516	5869938	Yes, Nintendo has some interesting things going on.
5870178	5876742	They've announced their new titles coming out in the first part of the year.
5876762	5880985	2010, of course, they're going to launch their first Wii game.
5881005	5886128	It's going to be Endless Ocean 2, the sequel to the Deep Sea Diving Sim.
5886608	5888169	I didn't really play a lot of the first one.
5888209	5893612	It was kind of neat, very pretty, but not something I really want to jump into for the next one.
5894472	5920085	Um, some DS titles, of course, the newest, I guess, I wouldn't really call them brand new, but, uh, Pokemon Heart, Gold, and SoulSilver, the kind of remix of, uh, Gold and Silver, and, um, there's some other cool things, uh, WiiWare titles, including And Yet It Moves, of course, um, like, you know, Super Meat Boy is kind of cool, they also have some third-party stuff listed as well, um,
5922153	5923734	Nothing to stand out from Konami.
5923774	5933380	Like, for example, we've got Dance Dance Revolution, although I believe that's... No, maybe that is a new title, Dance Dance Revolution.
5933941	5937883	I've heard there is some controversy going on right now because I think that list came out.
5938504	5945889	And right now that brand new Dance Dance Revolution is only slated for PS3 and Xbox and wasn't announced for Wii.
5946409	5949251	So it's kind of like, was this the announcement or what?
5949411	5962598	And, you know, the other thing, too, with Dance... I could see it probably coming to the Wii, but, you know, I remember before they were kind of lumping in all those games, you know, before at E3, as Dance Dance Revolution 1, Dance Dance Revolution for the Wii ended up being hot as Party 3, so... Right.
5962999	5969883	Um, and then same for the PlayStation 2, it ended up being X2, so... Eh, it might not be entirely accurate, but that's alright.
5970383	5970503	Um...
5971713	5981641	I have to say, as a long time music game fan and someone who's been critical of DDR over the past few years, I am interested in the reboot game that they're doing on Xbox 360 and PS3 because it is a reboot.
5982001	5984623	Something I've been saying DDR has needed for about five years.
5985784	5986205	We'll see.
5986445	5990608	DDR hasn't just needed a reboot, it's needed a resuscitation and a kick in the ass.
5991289	5994651	And we will see if this is it, although I will say the expectations are very low.
5994992	5997013	So Konami doesn't have to do much to impress me.
5997453	5997834	So we'll see.
5999059	5999940	WarioWare DIY WarioWare DIY
6018596	6019376	on different YouTubes.
6019897	6022978	So that's going to be available as well in March.
6023699	6037887	And then finally, just in time for Valentine's Day, you're going to be getting pink and blue Wii remotes are going to be released as well I believe just before Valentine's Day.
6039667	6041589	Yay, just as I always wanted a pink Wiimote.
6042609	6044130	Oh, well then remind me to get you one, Rob.
6044310	6045371	Yay, that's what I want for Christmas.
6045751	6047132	Oh, damn, they're not out until February.
6047672	6047872	Well...
6048632	6049492	Maybe for my birthday.
6049832	6052954	Now if they put out a pink console, that might sell a little bit.
6053134	6058396	Possibly.
6058616	6061497	The blue one's actually kind of cute.
6061597	6064438	Do you remember at E3 when they first showed the Wii?
6065279	6066399	How there were the blue ones?
6066599	6068000	Oh yeah, there were all the different colors.
6068340	6072822	But they didn't need to do that because the system sold like fucking nuts anyway.
6073202	6076083	And the curse of the white system did not hurt it.
6078345	6087775	Remember, because the, well, no, the Saturn, well, I don't know what it is, alright, the Saturn in Japan came out in white.
6088496	6089577	We got it over here in black.
6089858	6090338	What happened?
6090879	6091179	Poop.
6091599	6091820	Dead.
6091840	6092801	So, see, they learned.
6092821	6093261	They learned.
6093542	6093882	They learned.
6094827	6096088	Ziii has been trademarked.
6096108	6096788	Now, of course, rumors run rampant.
6096808	6097428	OMG, the Wii HD is the Ziii!
6120480	6124521	By the way though, just so you know, Z actually was trademarked in 2006.
6125442	6135624	Also trademarked, the B, the C, the we, the ye, and the Z. This Sesame Street.
6136245	6138065	I thought the we was oi.
6138305	6142606	Oi, oi, oi, like a punk rock system.
6142786	6145727	No, it's like a... It's for the hardcore gamer, the oi, oi.
6146087	6146828	No, it's French.
6147628	6147908	I see.
6148351	6153213	But, but, you know, also though, keep in mind, it's like, uh, you know, that totally made me think of Clue.
6154173	6154373	What?
6154553	6155314	Oui, oui, madame?
6155614	6156274	No, I'm sorry.
6156294	6157194	How do I know this?
6157875	6163097	Uh, they neglected the V because that's the one that the Chinese knockoff is called the V, isn't it?
6163297	6163497	Yeah.
6163757	6164697	Whoops, forgot that one.
6165157	6172020	And, and most importantly, uh, you forgot the P. Where's the P?
6172960	6173641	In the toilet!
6174241	6174361	Ah!
6176152	6180916	and they missed... Now see what's funny, somebody in chat said they forgot She, XII.
6180996	6182738	Wasn't that the name of a game on PlayStation?
6183298	6183758	I want to say.
6183979	6185900	No, that was XIII.
6186040	6188943	Oh, so XII was not taken, but XIII was.
6190924	6193306	She, though... It sounds familiar.
6193507	6193867	I don't know.
6195011	6210148	The Z thing though, and unfortunately I don't have the ability to put that clip on our stream right now, but Z reminds me of Charlie the Unicorn, the second one, where they go and they meet Z and they start speaking Spanish to the Z. I remember that.
6210989	6213491	That would be totally appropriate for this, but...
6215361	6243437	Deathwishing in chat says the Nintendo oi with oi circle pit run and mosh your face off see it's for the hardcore gamer that's exactly what it is we're gonna do another story real quick here but I wanted to introduce someone who just walked into studio tonight say hello to Tiara why hello there how are you I'm good thank you thanks for joining us tonight how have you been you're tardy you know we start at 6 o'clock right yeah I know I went on a date wait hold on hold on aren't you just visiting
6243905	6247029	Yeah, I'm visiting Jamie and I went out on a date with not Jamie.
6248731	6250033	You're a very naughty girl.
6250293	6250814	Did you have fun?
6251034	6251515	Yes, I did.
6251655	6257322	We saw The Blind Side, which I expected to hate, but apparently I like Sandra Bullock when she's not in a funny movie.
6257802	6258103	Okay.
6258403	6259384	Because she's not funny.
6259665	6260045	There you go.
6261158	6263080	I have played the hell out of Final Fantasy IV The After Years.
6263140	6263961	That game is so awesome!
6285001	6285902	I never finished it.
6285942	6288964	I feel bad because it was pretty badass, the parts that I played.
6289004	6292006	I played the opening chapter and I think I played a little bit of Rydia's side story.
6292506	6294948	But lots and lots of side stories to beat in that game.
6294988	6296008	Yeah, I have to be honest.
6296048	6297009	I didn't buy all of them.
6297189	6301592	But I played through the opening chapter, which is like the first three.
6301672	6305194	And then I played through part of Rydia's chapter before I drove up here.
6305695	6311959	So I'm excited to go home and play that and have the Wii Fit tell me how fat I am because it loves to do that.
6312772	6317057	I know, it's always kind of a downer to get on Wii Fit, and then you watch as your character goes, whoop!
6317818	6318859	It's like, oh!
6319540	6321462	But surely that hasn't happened for you.
6321522	6325547	You actually look like you've lost a little bit, so Wii Fit's been working for you.
6325767	6326508	Well, it's fun.
6326588	6328710	I'm a master of the hula hoop now.
6329151	6330232	If only in real life.
6330252	6332675	That was a good, useful skill, but no.
6333311	6333831	Eatsleepgeek.com Cool.
6333851	6334312	Who runs that?
6334332	6334712	A bunch of geeks?
6354983	6356284	Yes, I would have to say so.
6356444	6357424	It's not just a clever name.
6357785	6358805	Very good.
6359325	6360126	Are we ever going to start?
6360166	6365709	Now, I've heard rumors that someday there might be a Giggling Girl comic book show of sorts.
6367070	6369291	Well, Jamie and I had talked about that.
6369331	6374914	We had talked about doing kind of like a mini podcast for one of our weekly features for my blog.
6375574	6383420	But we never have time and of course I'm trying to graduate next year so I'm taking like eight classes in the semester.
6383701	6384741	She's already got a show.
6384821	6386002	Quit trying to ninja the hosts.
6387263	6388865	Quit trying to ninja them into your show.
6389585	6390125	I'm just kidding.
6390926	6392207	We're using that computer.
6394349	6396931	I heard they're going to borrow the show computer to do a side project.
6396951	6398432	So that's awesome.
6398572	6401694	I hope you guys are able to find the time but certainly school is school.
6402095	6402595	Yes, indeed.
6402995	6403215	Alright.
6404740	6412401	If you ever need a guest who never reads comic books, I will totally come on and be like the gay guy on the show that says witty things.
6413237	6414558	I will totally book you for that.
6414578	6414858	Awesome.
6414878	6418461	You'll be like, comics, I don't know anything about that, but Wolverine is hot.
6418661	6421343	Yeah, I need you to call my manager, though.
6421443	6422945	Just get that all arranged.
6423705	6424586	I'll give you my card.
6425567	6426047	Don't call us.
6426067	6426447	We'll call you.
6426888	6427208	All right.
6428609	6430090	No, but feel free, please, to pipe in.
6430110	6432872	Unfortunately, we don't have a fourth mic in studio because we're a little ghetto.
6433212	6435014	But if you want to say something, raise your hand.
6435034	6436075	A little ghetto?
6436555	6437916	Just reach your hand out and grab my mic.
6437956	6438536	Or grab Loki.
6438576	6439057	He's closest.
6439777	6440018	All right.
6440720	6443621	Anyhow, moving on with some more gaming news, DarkSakura.
6443881	6449461	Oh, for the record, and completely off topic, you know how you're wondering if there was a game called Z?
6450262	6456863	There was an alternate reality game that came out on the PS3 for PlayStation Home.
6456883	6458063	That's right.
6458083	6461624	Also, Devil Dice was called Psy, which was spelled X-I.
6462664	6465484	So we've had X-I, X-I-I, and X-I-I-I.
6465964	6466684	We've had stuff.
6466804	6469885	Well, I would like to create X-I-I-I-I, patent pending.
6471670	6472631	What, 13?
6473652	6474834	No, X-I-I-I-I, 14.
6474914	6477156	So should it be X-I-V?
6478178	6478878	You shut your mouth!
6481401	6482342	La la la, okay.
6483043	6484905	So how about my story, huh?
6484925	6485606	How about your story?
6486087	6486868	Yeah, how about that?
6487769	6491373	How about a particular rumor about a game I'm particularly looking forward to?
6492040	6511176	For Super Street Fighter 4, the rumors that they're getting 10 new characters total is actually something based off of a clip from the Thummy2 stream that's showing a different list on here.
6511256	6515820	So let me see if I can't find who else might be included on here.
6516760	6528587	Well, I know for a fact that they're getting DJ and Feilong and Adon and Guy and Cody, right?
6529667	6534930	I don't think they've announced any new ones, but there's like placeholders here, right?
6535558	6541742	Yeah, well, see, there's four here that are completely blank, according to this.
6541842	6546945	And I can actually link the clip to the chat room if they want to look at it.
6548286	6550868	It definitely, I think, would be worth seeing.
6553209	6556811	But from what I can tell on here... No, Dan, you can't talk to me right now.
6557332	6557572	Sorry.
6558833	6560614	What I can tell on here is that...
6563746	6573237	Yeah, I recognized about everybody else on here, so I wouldn't think of who they could have put in unless they're adding in, like, Charlie and Rolento and maybe Hagar.
6573578	6581187	What's interesting is that the game, we were only supposed to be getting, like, six, I think, in an earlier interview, or maybe it was seven or eight, but now it's up to ten.
6581227	6582909	Like, it's almost like they can't put this down.
6583229	6583710	They can't...
6584250	6586634	Getaway from this project, which is a good thing.
6586714	6590379	It means that they really love it, but that's a lot of new characters, too.
6590439	6592202	It's just these four empty slots on here.
6592222	6595346	It makes me wonder what's going to go in.
6595386	6599993	This has to be from some kind of beta or demo on here.
6600393	6604637	Hakan equals an Arab oil dude Ono talked about but hasn't been revealed yet
6625855	6631256	and I've heard that rumor too that there was some type of like oil tycoon fighter in it as well.
6632077	6634997	Okay, GameGuru, is Charlie really dead or is he Jean Grey dead?
6636658	6637038	Answer that.
6637358	6640759	Maybe Street Fighter is like Heroes where people die but they don't ever like die.
6641379	6643299	Maybe it's like Heroes where they get their brains eaten.
6644160	6649441	Or maybe it's like Heroes where it starts to suck by the third season but then gets good again at the fourth season.
6649621	6652702	And then I stopped watching it at the fourth season but apparently...
6654014	6674746	of course you realize all I know about heroes is the brain eating and the cheerleader is like Wolverine look I'm just saying Street Fighter doesn't have Zachary Quinto that's all I'm saying ZQ or GTFO maybe it's like that episode of Heroes where Spock accidentally blows up Romulus and Nero goes back in time to find him
6675734	6676254	Perhaps.
6676815	6691722	Actually, in an unrelated story that I don't think we covered yet, but did you hear about that, that ZQ actually announced this week at the Video Game Awards, he's going to be doing the voice for Star Trek Online, I guess like doing the opening narration or whatever, and I'm just like, he can talk to me anytime he wants.
6692143	6695224	But he will be doing a William Shatner impression.
6695324	6696365	No!
6696965	6700587	You know what, by the way, I have decided to get the Amazon one, because I want a Borg chick.
6701567	6702408	Okay, fair enough.
6703100	6704541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6722614	6728318	Okay, I'm going to totally out myself as a super nerd, but I read the Star Trek novels.
6728798	6729339	Nerd!
6729879	6736864	And in the novels, there's a half Vulcan who totally rejects her Vulcan side and is kind of sassy.
6737064	6739426	So, yeah, you could be sassy.
6740567	6743028	I can't play MMOs and not be sassy.
6743148	6743909	It's my thing.
6744149	6745530	Remember, we have to make the Olorians.
6746270	6747972	That's true, and I'll have one of those.
6747992	6750013	You have to be sassy in the pants.
6750073	6751174	I have to have a sassy Vulcan.
6751581	6752762	You have to be sassy in the pants.
6752802	6753202	That's right.
6754162	6754663	Absolutely.
6754863	6756263	I started playing WoW again, Rob.
6756303	6756884	Did you see that?
6756924	6757344	Sucker.
6757904	6758484	How's it going?
6758825	6759385	It's going good.
6759445	6761046	My priest is almost 43.
6761926	6764287	I've been using that dungeon finder thing.
6766548	6767889	And Jamie's on the phone with Dan.
6768329	6769010	It must be important.
6770290	6771511	The dungeon finder's great, though.
6771791	6773272	Oh, yeah.
6773332	6777034	I leveled from 37 to 42 in two days just doing that.
6777114	6777494	So nice.
6778479	6778999	It wasn't important.
6779460	6783883	But anyways, I am also getting Star Trek online, obviously, because I'm a big, huge nerd.
6784484	6786445	Final Fantasy XIV, we talked about earlier in the show.
6787867	6788047	What?
6791229	6791930	Probably not.
6792321	6792881	Alright, fair enough.
6793582	6795643	Some comments in chat about the Sassy Vulcan.
6795943	6800326	SalaciousPop says, instead of saying that's not logical, she says, so ignorant.
6801646	6802747	So ignorant.
6802987	6807790	SSJ100Matt says, Rob's character, live long and prosper, betch.
6810351	6810911	That's a good one.
6810951	6811412	I like that.
6812052	6812932	We'll see what happens there.
6813933	6817094	Also, Tiger Claw is letting me know some specifics on that.
6817454	6820395	Apparently, he's also doing the voice of the emergency medical hologram.
6820856	6822416	Although, I got to say, come on.
6822756	6824737	The guy who did it, what was his name?
6825438	6830140	The emergency hologram program, Robert Picardo or whatever his name was in Voyager.
6830760	6834481	When you think emergency medical program, I always think of him.
6834782	6837543	Remember how they got him a cameo in First Contact?
6837563	6838003	Yeah.
6838601	6839121	Dan Lost My Copy
6866713	6868774	Anyhow, sorry, let's get into some other gaming news.
6868794	6869595	Just a couple quick articles.
6869615	6870955	We're going to get to the mailbag here very soon.
6871095	6871375	Loki.
6871896	6880420	Yes, Nintendo has trademarked what is going to be about equally retarded as the Wii Vitality Sensor, Wii Relax.
6882601	6885023	Yes, it's a game about relaxing.
6886663	6891246	It involves you putting on a vitality sensor so that you can relax.
6891446	6892967	Relax or die!
6894361	6895442	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6918737	6924259	Isn't that kind of counterintuitive, you know, with the whole Wii Fit?
6925040	6926040	Am I supposed to be moving?
6926060	6926740	I mean, you know.
6928241	6928721	Well, no.
6930542	6937565	As far as the only thing I've ever known, like any type of exercise thing I've ever done where you have to keep perfectly still is doing isolation exercises.
6937865	6939906	So other than that, I don't know.
6941406	6942447	I'm grabbing at straws here.
6942607	6943227	I'm trying to.
6944676	6945597	Find some logic in this.
6945937	6946838	I don't know.
6946918	6950421	Hopefully the game is going to say, you know, relax, but don't touch yourself.
6952964	6953564	No wanking.
6954345	6955206	Wait a second.
6955346	6959270	The game is going to be like, please put it on your finger.
6959870	6960451	Wait a second.
6960471	6961532	That is not your finger.
6962953	6963614	Stop that.
6963754	6964575	That is dirty.
6964655	6965856	Please do not be fapping.
6969946	6971126	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6998578	7000179	Can't get more relaxed than a corpse.
7001399	7002199	I can just see it now.
7002499	7005040	Person dies while playing We Relax and the game never knew.
7005060	7006901	High score.
7008341	7010362	World record in We Relax.
7012443	7014223	Anyhow, that's terrible.
7014483	7015604	Hey, we should do that.
7015804	7017824	We should try to go for the world record.
7018184	7019085	In We Relax?
7019665	7020625	No, then we'll die.
7020705	7023766	That's the only way you're going to get the world record is to die while playing We Relax.
7025267	7025847	It's worth it.
7027473	7027553	No?
7027873	7028614	No, no.
7029034	7029374	Anyhow.
7029534	7031095	I like the whole living thing, you know?
7031956	7033236	I like this idea better.
7033296	7035537	How about we go kill a million freaking zombies?
7036558	7037839	That would be super awesome.
7037859	7039079	That always makes a good game.
7039139	7041801	Hence why Left 4 Dead is so freaking amazing.
7042601	7051286	Apparently, what's going on here is that they're going to get characters from the original Left 4 Dead to now hang out with the...
7052126	7053007	New characters.
7053447	7062353	So apparently the old characters and the new characters from Left 4 Dead 2 will meet in a game called The Passing, or a download content piece.
7063033	7065735	It's called The Most Important Campaign in the Left 4 Dead Story.
7065955	7068857	All the survivors are being called together in one campaign.
7069157	7071399	That's from the Valve VP of Marketing, Doug Lombardi.
7071679	7074701	That's going to come out in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PC.
7075061	7077883	It's going to have a co-op campaign in rural Georgia and...
7078163	7078743	Thank you for watching!
7106564	7108825	Coming to you right now is the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.
7108865	7112826	It's the part of the show every week where we take some emails and read them for you live on air.
7113126	7113606	Yay.
7114547	7117307	So, DarkSakura, please open up the meal bag.
7117868	7118088	What?
7118568	7119868	I can't talk tonight.
7120729	7121569	I'm broken.
7121649	7122549	I need to be fixed.
7123669	7124350	Not in that way.
7124490	7128031	You need to get us... I need to wee relax is what I need to do.
7128111	7128991	You need to get us cupcakes.
7130412	7131792	I do not need a goddamn cupcake.
7131932	7133973	You need to get us cupcakes.
7135472	7137074	How's that gonna help me?
7137414	7140577	You'll be doing a good deed, and it'll make you feel better in your heart.
7140717	7143580	Isn't We Relax thinking about baseball anyways?
7145962	7149005	We Relax is mean... Think about it.
7149265	7153329	Getting through with the... And it makes your Wii relax.
7155731	7156992	They should do We Irritate.
7157112	7157493	Mailbag!
7159127	7164308	Well, this is sort of a mass email, so I'm going to go ahead and read it.
7164828	7165648	I have a question.
7165728	7170949	If a kid has the money to get a console but no games, should the parent get the games for that console?
7170989	7172629	For me, it is an Xbox 360.
7172749	7174770	I can only survive on demos for so long.
7175230	7176870	Sincerely, DSMaster26.
7177650	7177950	P.S.
7177990	7181171	This is typed on a Wii with Wiimote, and I'm visually impaired, and lawsuits are disgraced.
7181191	7181631	Shame on him.
7183151	7183491	Okay.
7183831	7184291	Okay.
7184451	7187212	McDonald's is an equal opportunity employer.
7188208	7190971	You can get a job and save up and buy yourself some games.
7191672	7193694	Parents don't have to buy you shit.
7194534	7204184	Parents might reward you with games or consoles or what have you if you've been a good little boy and or girl and you do chores around the house and what have you.
7205245	7211231	Or maybe you're in a household where you're fortunate enough to be spoiled to your heart's content like maybe Paris Hilton was when she was growing up.
7211631	7214313	Unfortunately, that's not the way most of us have it.
7214393	7218997	So, you know, parents don't have to buy anything at all.
7219377	7226362	In fact, keep in mind, in this economy of people losing their jobs and stuff, some parents can't afford to buy games at all.
7226462	7232386	So, you know, you might be lucky to be getting a variety puzzle book from Penny Press.
7232466	7233647	And that's your game.
7233827	7238190	If you've got a Wii and an Xbox 360, you can sell one of them to get games for the other.
7240032	7240272	You know...
7240965	7247667	The reason I can get away with having all of these systems is because, well, until I hurt my hand, I had enough money to buy them.
7248347	7254389	In certain states, if you're like 14, you can get a work permit and go work at certain places.
7254429	7254970	And you know what?
7255550	7258671	It's not a bad idea because work experience goes a long way.
7258731	7265973	I mean, you might not want to work, but if you want a really cushy job in the future, working the crap jobs now help get you there faster.
7267113	7268574	So, just something to think about.
7269508	7271229	MoLons unless you have lethal allergies.
7271850	7273231	You'll find something.
7273812	7286562	If you were skilled enough to type this email on a Wii or whatever, you probably can help old ladies and old men get their computers set up.
7287363	7290465	I bet there's a lot of things that you probably can still do.
7290986	7292607	Yeah, you just have to look around for it.
7292747	7296750	And on top of that, it's not like you can't start a change jar.
7298342	7303224	But maybe your parents don't want you to get a job at 14, and that's their prerogative.
7303524	7306745	My parents didn't want me to have a job that young because they wanted me to focus on studying.
7307125	7310326	So maybe try to work something out with your parents.
7310946	7311826	Do you get an allowance?
7312007	7312927	I want this game.
7313007	7314187	How can I get this game?
7314227	7315148	Can I get a job?
7315528	7317328	Can I do chores around the house?
7317748	7318949	Can I get good grades?
7319449	7321430	That's not something I got the answer to.
7321670	7325451	Your parents will raise you however they want and or can.
7327151	7342314	or you know and certainly in other cases you know when I say parents I mean whoever is caring for you right now your guardians etc etc just because there's many different types of families out there I just want to point that out the last one is big long email
7343114	7343955	Hey, OLR Crew!
7343995	7351538	Since I probably can't make it to tonight's episode due to finals and such, I thought I'd email my review of the game I'd like to share with everyone.
7352138	7357400	Mushihime-sama Futari, a 2D bullet hell shooter from awesome folks at Cave.
7358181	7363943	For those who haven't been caught up on the recent shmup news, the recent Xbox 360 port of Futari is region-free.
7364483	7368485	Having heard this news, I pre-ordered my copy and received it within a week and a half of it shipping out.
7368965	7370365	So far, the game is mind-blowing.
7370825	7374886	After having played Touhou for a few months, Futari is especially pretty in comparison.
7375446	7377847	The games are very nicely detailed and vivid.
7378247	7382508	Although there is slowdown, it's implemented on purpose in order to make the game easier at times.
7383108	7388289	As far as play options and modes go, Futari offers a wide variety of them.
7388849	7395451	You can customize the game's display to your liking from the rotation of the screen for those dedicated enough to rotate their TVs for vertical shooters,
7395871	7396552	and DarkSakura.
7414891	7424535	Then there's Arrange Mode, a unique and complex twist on the regular gameplay, with the ability to switch characters as well as slow down bullets close to you and reflect them back to crank out tons of points.
7425436	7433019	And if you're looking for stress relief or bad at shooters, there's the Novice Mode, a glorified easy mode that offers the easy versions of Original, Maniac, and Ultra.
7433499	7437441	I tried Novice, Ultra, and the bullet patterns are dense enough that you go, uh, wow.
7438141	7438862	Thank you for watching!
7459156	7460296	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7480914	7487056	It offers revised, original, and maniac modes, as well as a new god mode that is like Ultra Mode, but with somewhat less retardedness.
7487337	7487837	Is that a word?
7488477	7489277	And new shot types.
7489477	7503143	While I like Black Label, I question whether it's worth the 1,200 Microsoft points, especially since I can get Raiden Fighters Aces 3 games in one for $5 more, or one of a handful of standalone shmups for anywhere between $5 and $10.
7504663	7511189	If you're a dedicated Bullet Hell fan or have an Xbox 360 of any region lying around, you owe it to yourself to snap up a copy of Futari for $3.60.
7511489	7512570	I mean, hey, $70?
7513550	7515992	At least you're not paying triple digits for the arcade hardware.
7516353	7518594	And that's from Ray Iannami, slash GS68.
7518675	7518995	P.S.
7519055	7522818	This email is brought to you by San Jose State University, home of the never-ending furlough days.
7523464	7524805	It's on the list of things to play.
7525385	7533850	The next one on my list other than Bayonetta for my Japanese region system was Oto Media's Gorgeous was the next one I wanted to play.
7533950	7536832	Then of course the one he mentioned was...
7538052	7538753	Dan's Monitor Rotates
7558388	7563050	So, um, he's actually pulled out the monitor and rotated it to play, um, shmups.
7563930	7567992	Because I think he got, like, uh, Raiden and Raiden 2 to run on MAME.
7568852	7570873	So, yeah, he's, it works.
7572494	7572694	Hmm.
7574195	7575335	Alright, well, thank you for the review.
7575395	7576035	We appreciate it.
7576095	7578456	And, of course, you can always send in your own game review if you want to.
7578536	7581117	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send emails.
7581157	7582198	Was that it for emails tonight?
7582734	7583314	It was indeed.
7583354	7584335	Well, then there you go.
7584415	7586075	So let's move on to some more stories.
7586095	7591037	Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7591378	7592338	But not just yet.
7592638	7594719	For now, let's do some last few stories here.
7596039	7600141	Well, before we do stories, though... Oh, gosh, that's right.
7600161	7601202	We have to get to the angst.
7601222	7603462	Well, not now, because DarkSakura just ran to use the potty.
7603482	7604503	So we'll do the stories in the angst.
7604523	7606204	She went through a different type of angst.
7606244	7606424	Yes.
7609282	7613548	Anyways, there's a rumor that NHL 2K11 may be cancelled.
7614830	7618174	And maybe 2K Sports is in some sort of financial trouble.
7619336	7622700	This is coming from the recently released...
7624851	7627713	Take-Two's Q4 Fiscal 2009 results.
7628433	7632935	And there's a section of games that the publisher is currently planning to ship in 2010.
7633616	7641600	Both MLB 2K10 and NBA 2K11 are listed on the report, although I would think it's... I can't remember if it's 2K9.
7641800	7642920	Yeah, I guess that's right there.
7642940	7643781	You're behind or whatever.
7644441	7644721	Anyways.
7646322	7650384	And, of course, that NHL 2K11 is not on the list.
7653146	7653547	Interesting.
7653567	7662656	And it says, we are currently in the process of evaluating our sports portfolio and have not announced any new NHL titles at this time.
7663597	7667341	And, you know, that's a pretty damning statement they put it.
7668222	7668362	And
7669733	7680047	Also saying that if NHL 2K is no more, the franchise appears to be dying the same death as, I guess, College Hoops 2K series.
7680067	7685314	So they're kind of slimlining, I guess, their portfolio as far as
7687039	7698106	And honestly, I'm kind of surprised with the NHL stuff, because I always thought the NHL 2K did a lot better than the EA's NHL games.
7698747	7702189	I think it was a better put-together game.
7702209	7711194	At least my friend at work, who's really huge in the hockey, used to pick up the 2K series quite often, and he seemed to like it a lot better.
7711274	7712875	But, eh, who knows.
7713816	7713896	Um...
7715168	7726603	And of course, they're wondering that maybe 2K Sports as a publisher might be in some trouble as well, seeing as MLB 2K apparently didn't
7727867	7729568	All American Football 2K or whatever that sucked.
7756516	7757036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7781332	7782132	Thank you for watching!
7801380	7803081	Make your way to Champions Online right now
7824052	7828194	What is Warcraft doing for their holiday event?
7828434	7832036	They kind of do the same thing they do usually during the holiday events.
7832876	7836158	They call it the festival something.
7836178	7836698	I don't remember.
7837478	7841180	They have to give everything very generic holiday names because they're not taken from the real world.
7841540	7860306	but they do holiday events pretty much the same every year but sometimes they add new things like a new boss or this year they added Thanksgiving event was brand new so you know they kind of go back to the calendar and add new things but they do holidays throughout the year all right anyhow um let's get to the FUs of the week because I missed doing it earlier and um but I just wanted to talk about teddy bears
7876764	7879347	Um, you know, I've had a really great weekend.
7880809	7883413	So, uh, I can't really say F you to anything.
7884674	7887978	Except maybe, um, situations regarding a late paycheck.
7888739	7889020	And EBD.
7890293	7896477	I've heard that California, like, I don't know about disability, but unemployment especially had some hurdles recently, too.
7896657	7897878	I don't know if that affects it all ends of it.
7897898	7904882	Well, I'm actually more pissed off at EDD for not sending me certain paperwork that I needed to fill out three weeks ago.
7905623	7908545	So I'm still waiting on three weeks of pay.
7908825	7909085	Lame.
7909465	7913508	But starting next week, though, I'm back to getting some of my regular checks.
7914068	7914328	Loki!
7916554	7927922	Um, a few people that think it's necessary to put inflatable holiday, I don't even know what you'd call them, decorations out on their lawn and or house.
7928462	7930784	Apparently it is just really prevalent this year.
7931348	7932769	I mean, they're all over the fucking place.
7932829	7937272	In fact, our neighbor's house across the street decided, hey, you know what would be a great idea?
7937292	7940494	Let's put Frosty the Snowman on our roof with some presents.
7940654	7943796	It looks like a giant fucking snowman is attacking the house.
7944236	7946457	It is just retarded.
7946737	7949459	And people need to... Maybe that's the next Champions Online boss.
7949499	7949839	Who knows?
7949879	7950980	They need to cut it back.
7951040	7960306	I mean, because they've got all sorts of playable things from, you know, giant snow globes to there's a guy in the corner that has Santa riding a Harley.
7960987	7976427	it's ridiculous and I mean it's just another thing that the holiday can barf onto your house because there's some people that have everything and they just keep adding every year and oh my god one house looks like they threw the lights just over the house and that's it it's sad
7977376	7979437	I like DarkSakura.
7979618	7982860	Things are pretty good for me right now, so I don't have a lot of angst, actually.
7983060	7986742	But I will say, F you to mob mentality, especially on the internets.
7987483	7988984	God, some people are real sheep.
7990424	7993526	Clearly I'm not talking about any of you, of course, folks listening, what have you.
7993546	7997009	It's just things I observe as I lurk on the internets.
7998430	8001732	I do also, though, think there should be an F you directed to that site, too.
8003269	8004049	Oh, yeah, of course.
8004130	8006731	Well, that goes... God, they got 20 minutes of an FU earlier.
8006771	8008031	I don't need to give them any more time.
8008632	8008972	All right.
8009372	8010933	And, of course, how could we forget?
8010993	8011673	Tiara's here.
8011733	8013774	Maybe she wants to get in on the angst tonight.
8015055	8018296	I would like to say FU to people who deny the Holocaust.
8019977	8021178	Like, how can you do that?
8022498	8023359	I know.
8023379	8025320	I'm laughing because it's ridiculous.
8026148	8040164	Well, a teacher, a PE teacher in Las Vegas was suspended for telling students that the Holocaust didn't exist and that photographs were doctored, textbooks are inaccurate, and that the Nazis lacked the technology to kill so many people.
8040644	8042727	And I just, I hope they fire her.
8042867	8043588	F you to that lady.
8045367	8045767	Wow.
8046628	8046988	Wow.
8047108	8048189	That's all I can say is wow.
8049951	8050271	I don't know.
8050351	8058617	I kind of put, well, that's really bad, but the whole 9-11 conspiracy theories, like, come on.
8059198	8059558	Really?
8060439	8066163	Well, first of all, in both situations, you've got first-person accounts from people who were there.
8067224	8069686	You know, it's ridiculous.
8069706	8069946	Ridiculous.
8070410	8071851	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8094466	8097290	I'm doing very well, and sounds like you guys are doing well too.
8097511	8098973	Excellent, yes, actually we're doing pretty good.
8099213	8102839	When two of the three hosts have very little to rant about, it's usually a good night.
8103620	8104721	But what's on your mind?
8105082	8106504	To what do we owe this phone call tonight?
8107606	8107926	Well...
8108835	8114677	As many of you know, as many people have been following, Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix is coming out this week.
8114937	8125100	Yes, we talked about it at the top of the show, of course, but for those that tuned in late, it's like a fan project dedicated to the show, which Loki, myself, and DarkSakura, we didn't do shit for this project.
8125380	8126000	We didn't do anything.
8127261	8128141	Well, not directly.
8128201	8133683	I mean, you guys created the shenanigans that is the show, and we kind of went with it.
8134203	8134683	So we...
8136712	8138655	I would say I'm the lead developer, but you know what?
8138816	8141260	This has all been a group effort.
8141641	8144767	A lot of listeners have contributed.
8145448	8148975	It took us two years, but I think we made a very great game.
8150100	8151942	Well, tell us about some of the thank yous.
8152002	8155585	Who are some of the people we need to give hugs and kisses to for making this game happen besides you?
8159508	8164813	I would say, you know, the hardcore listeners like, you know, we have Actdeft who worked on a couple songs.
8164853	8172219	We have DarkTetsuya, Misty, Breslul, who gave us the amazing announcer pack.
8173420	8173500	Um,
8174884	8176626	and a lot of other people I can't even think of.
8176686	8179289	Did you really have to put that guy song in there though?
8179309	8183194	Because I saw that YouTube and I was like, what is this?
8185285	8186166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8214670	8216171	The inside joke is, it's just John.
8216532	8217592	I see, okay, fair enough.
8218353	8224118	But, you know, we have a lot of things in there from, you know, back from your old days from USL.
8225199	8225799	Oh, God.
8226080	8226600	Oh, man.
8226640	8228041	You want to talk about embarrassing stuff?
8228221	8234407	I'd rather the Like a Prayer stuff be released on, like, Entertainment Tonight than some of the old USL clips.
8235387	8238670	Oh, well, we pretty much have everything that you've sung on there.
8238930	8239311	Great.
8241052	8243034	Contributed by a certain Mr. Donovan.
8243784	8244864	Oh, great.
8245024	8246005	I'm sure.
8246325	8254067	Loki, be glad we didn't know you back then because Travis had a way of getting you to make an ass out of yourself on the radio.
8254447	8255687	God bless Travis Donovan.
8255707	8258768	I would probably not be doing internet radio right now still if it were not for him.
8258788	8262089	I still remember the number one way to make him upset was to drop the C-bomb.
8263169	8263909	That's right.
8264029	8265150	And you kept doing it.
8266590	8268411	Because it was my favorite word at the time.
8269291	8269751	But anyhow.
8270421	8275622	But you know, Loki didn't get unscathed on this, so both of his performances are in the game.
8275962	8276403	Thank God.
8276803	8279523	This is why I don't do karaoke on the internet.
8279543	8282044	Were you able to find anything embarrassing of DarkSakura?
8283444	8285145	Actually, no, we haven't been able to.
8285445	8288466	We have our archivers, but no one was able to find anything.
8288686	8291186	Ask Travis for the apology song.
8291407	8291807	No!
8293567	8294787	That's all I'm going to say.
8294867	8296668	Actually, that would piss me off.
8298819	8300940	Beyond, piss her off with laughter.
8303001	8306404	I don't understand why we have to get the bad stuff.
8306804	8309185	That's actually something that I'm still upset with him about.
8310346	8311427	Then don't ask him about that.
8312308	8315790	Ask him to hear it, just don't put it in the game.
8317071	8323535	Other things that we put in, we kind of made themed non-stop tracks of songs that are
8324272	8325773	That you guys would enjoy.
8325813	8328255	You know, we have a lot of songs from the Cage match.
8328275	8334679	We got a lot of songs that, you know, you, Jamie, and Matt like.
8334719	8338081	So, you know, it's got pretty much everything in it.
8338121	8341043	Just an all ABBA course for me, of course.
8341983	8344285	Although we don't have a whole lot of ABBA in it.
8344525	8346006	Oh, well, fine.
8346746	8347347	We have Skulk.
8347367	8348428	We know you like that.
8348568	8349008	Oh, yes.
8349228	8349828	That's my favorite.
8349848	8351369	We have Castlevania stuff for Jamie.
8351389	8351710	We have...
8354226	8358508	We have a couple of Loki's remixes in there, so it's really got everything in it.
8358608	8359149	And you know what?
8359229	8360529	It doesn't just end here.
8360589	8364031	We actually are planning on doing DLC for it.
8364532	8366213	Oh my god, DLC.
8366273	8366653	That's amazing.
8366893	8372756	And of course, this is all free because it's kind of a ripoff of DDR in the first place, so you can't really charge for it.
8372796	8375878	But if the listeners want to grab it, how can they get a copy of the game?
8376769	8382071	Well, the game comes out on Christmas Eve, so this will be a nice Christmas present for all the All Our fans.
8382371	8389934	And it will be up on the website, in the forums, so you'll be able to download it, spread it out, give it to everyone to your heart's content.
8390287	8390667	That's right.
8390787	8392188	Spread it like a badass TD.
8392328	8395568	Just go out there and tell all your friends.
8396149	8408112	I truly think it's awesome that you guys have spent so much time on what some might view as a silly little project, but I kind of go, wow, the show actually people wanted to do that for our show?
8408392	8413153	I can't describe for you how neat that feels.
8413193	8415234	We couldn't have been able to do it without you guys.
8415534	8416694	If you guys didn't do the show, then...
8418073	8420954	Nerds Hovering Around a Keyboard
8448172	8448453	All right.
8448933	8454455	Anyhow, SSJ100 Matt, is there anything else you want to say about the project or anything else going on in your week that you want to tell us about?
8456296	8456776	Nothing really.
8456836	8464820	I mean, I've just been playing the new crack game that I have is Modern Warfare 2 and, you know, plenty of NHL.
8465340	8469622	But aside from that, you know, working on this game so everyone can get it out on Christmas.
8470202	8471763	So aside from that.
8472685	8473826	Are there Iraqi suicide babies?
8498004	8498985	That's an old joke.
8499065	8499625	That's good.
8499805	8500806	I can't say.
8501966	8503487	Might be the toasty thing that comes out.
8503527	8503847	I don't know.
8504247	8507989	Or what other really, really old jokes do we have on the show?
8508049	8509190	I've got to go way back.
8510430	8511211	Big Black Cock.
8511251	8511791	That's old.
8511831	8514212	The King of Iron Fingering.
8514392	8515993	Now that's a good embarrassing Jamie moment.
8516253	8518835	Yeah, but that was old and I don't care anymore.
8518855	8522577	She's over it now.
8522917	8525318	But yeah, definitely check out fans if
8526445	8530771	In the chat room and everyone, check out the Orange Lines Revolution YouTube channel.
8531773	8535919	We're posting up previews of everything and eventually we'll post up everything that's on there.
8537336	8537796	Check it out now.
8564404	8567246	Oh god, they actually had the video of the Like a Prayer thing there?
8568346	8568866	I hate you.
8570607	8571007	Where was it?
8571068	8571868	Here it is, here it is.
8572808	8575050	This is one of the great classics you can play in this game.
8577671	8578471	I'm waiting for it to buff.
8586315	8588256	So it's like The Legend of Max, right, basically?
8588536	8589177	Hold on, wait.
8599244	8602307	or this one, Guyonora Waternal.
8606231	8606952	If it'll load.
8607132	8607533	Here we go.
8610075	8612218	Here we go.
8612698	8612958	Guy.
8613839	8613999	Guy.
8614020	8614100	Guy.
8627836	8630686	See, to someone who listens to Under Station Live, that's funny.
8630746	8633837	To the rest of us, we're like, what is that?
8635679	8637360	But you all know John, so you know.
8638100	8638661	I know.
8638881	8640782	John needs to come back and visit.
8641142	8648247	Although I have heard rumors, I have heard rumblings, that the one and only Travis Donovan is considering a Sacramento visit.
8648707	8652910	We may have Travis Donovan on this very program.
8653911	8657453	And I could have sworn at one point he swore he would never come on Orange Floss Radio.
8658434	8659555	But that might have changed.
8659675	8663277	It's eight years now, and we may have him on the program.
8663357	8663897	That would be...
8665018	8665759	I can't even explain.
8665779	8667340	That would be like DC and Marvel.
8668140	8671383	Seriously, set your TiVos now, kids.
8671683	8672743	That's going to be an amazing show.
8675145	8675385	All right.
8676086	8679548	SJ100, Matt, thank you so much for the call, and thank you again for all your hard work in this project.
8679588	8680309	It's going to be a lot of fun.
8680349	8680909	Thank you, guys.
8681189	8681489	All right.
8681569	8681890	Take care.
8682610	8683090	Yep, take care.
8684171	8684732	I'd love that call.
8684992	8685452	Thank you.
8685772	8686613	No, thank you.
8686713	8687093	No, no, no.
8687253	8687674	Thank you.
8687894	8688634	No, no, no, no.
8689035	8689335	Thank you.
8690301	8713370	if you want to give us a call and say your thanks or let us thank you for calling 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call again that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so you can go ahead and give us a call right now we're taking calls live while we wait for some calls since there is a little bit of a buffer between when we say things here in studio and when you guys hear them on the feed let's get some last minute stories Loki
8713530	8719752	The Sims 3 is releasing a tool to create your own worlds, so you can build your own towns in those said worlds.
8720432	8724813	And that'll be released soon, although I don't see when.
8725353	8725693	All right.
8726613	8727954	Russell, Russell, Thumble, Thumble.
8727994	8728854	Hi, caller, are you there?
8728874	8729794	You're on Orange Sounds Radio.
8729814	8730534	Who's this?
8730814	8731394	Hi, who is this?
8731414	8733175	It's Deathwishing.
8733415	8734255	Hi, Deathwishing.
8734275	8734875	What's on your mind?
8736416	8738456	Well, first off, can I say an F you?
8738476	8741057	Because I kind of feel like I probably should have said this instead of what I said.
8741477	8741717	Okay.
8741737	8741817	Okay.
8742728	8745889	F you to the Modern Warfare 2 hackers, you've ruined it for me.
8746209	8746770	What do they do?
8749451	8756553	The spin lately, I don't know if the patch has addressed it yet, but they've actually made it where certain playlists and stuff will put you into hacked games and stuff.
8756673	8761875	I really like the third-person playlists on it, and I'm now getting put into 18-player free-for-all.
8764895	8772465	with unlimited noob tube people like unlimited ammo with noob tubes and then when someone gets an AC-130 it's just rapid fire.
8776371	8779491	I support hacking and cracking your own game.
8779631	8790773	If you want to go hack Modern Warfare so that you jump to the sun whenever you jump or that you have infinite rockets or whatever, go for it.
8791013	8797355	But when you go and force that on other people in multiplayer to inflate your EP to make you feel better, that's just messed up.
8797375	8798675	That's not what the rest of us are paying for.
8799724	8800344	Just stinks.
8801365	8802385	Hack it to your heart's content.
8802405	8803346	Just don't go online with it.
8804566	8806007	And I also got a PS3.
8806607	8807567	Well, congratulations.
8807607	8808588	Did you get any games for it?
8809628	8810049	Not yet.
8810349	8810689	Not yet.
8810729	8811309	Are you thinking?
8811369	8812730	Well, you sent us a tweet earlier.
8812750	8815811	I rented Killzone 2.
8816351	8816912	And how was that?
8817912	8818472	It's beautiful.
8819373	8825976	Have you thought about... Now, you were asking us about a lot of retail games, but have you thought about any of the download stuff that PlayStation Network offers?
8826016	8828237	Bat Princess was the first thing that came to mind.
8828357	8828657	Really?
8828757	8829197	Did you get it?
8830057	8830297	No.
8830577	8832038	I don't have the money.
8832918	8833458	Oh, I see then.
8833678	8837359	Well, maybe for Christmas you'll get some money or some PSN cards and you can talk about it in a future show.
8838639	8842580	And, um, I found out an old thing you guys didn't think about, an old joke.
8843000	8843260	Okay.
8843380	8844941	Fuck exclamation points.
8847461	8847681	What?
8848542	8849582	Fuck you exclamation points?
8849602	8850282	You don't remember that?
8851042	8852603	The exclamation points?
8853343	8853663	Yeah.
8854903	8855683	You have to explain.
8855763	8855943	No.
8857184	8858384	Uh, it's hard to explain.
8859983	8864326	Never mind Hold on, where's our Price is Right losing horn?
8864346	8873593	I think I just died a little bit You don't even want to try and explain what this is?
8873613	8883040	Because obviously you thought it was funny I don't really want to explain because I've been up for 32 hours What have you been up for 32 hours for?
8883900	8884541	It was my party
8885253	8888695	Well, it's your party and you'll make a fail call to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to.
8888755	8890696	So congratulations.
8891016	8892177	This fail horn is for you.
8893437	8896879	I want to kill myself.
8896959	8897940	I want to kill myself.
8899461	8900281	Don't kill yourself.
8900341	8901062	Just go to bed.
8901562	8905624	Oh, and Allison, the best thing, it's a 4chan meme.
8906624	8907405	Oh, God.
8908085	8910266	Did I really just let that onto this program?
8910306	8911787	Oh, well, I suppose it was inevitable at some point.
8911967	8912508	Oh, well, whatever.
8913128	8913408	Alright.
8916297	8921220	Where there is a dark corner of the internet to be hiding in, there lies 4chan.
8921320	8922340	What do you know?
8922761	8924902	And I hide there because I fail.
8925762	8927443	Alright, well congratulations on failing.
8927743	8929624	Alright, have a good night, death wishing, and happy birthday.
8930725	8932426	They want your cupcakes, by the way.
8933466	8934547	Oh, yeah, I have 15 of them.
8934987	8935628	Awesome, later.
8936128	8941391	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8941431	8942692	Try not to have a fail call.
8943472	8944953	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8947408	8948869	No, okay, I'm done with that.
8948929	8950370	Did that really come from 4chan?
8952231	8957753	Okay, that whole thing, this is completely unrelated to why I'm calling, but this is Breslow, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.
8957813	8958734	Oh, hi, Breslow, sorry.
8959334	8963856	I would assume the listeners know that from the screechy voice we heard in guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy.
8964557	8964977	Just kidding.
8965617	8966578	I hate everybody.
8967378	8971260	I was red in the face when you were playing that, so now everybody thinks of me as this monster.
8971280	8975542	Well, good, now you know how I feel when I saw the like a prayer thing on YouTube.
8976669	8978130	What did you want?
8978351	8978491	Yes.
8978531	8978891	Because...
9005230	9008632	We started a tradition two years ago on this very station.
9011273	9014835	We called it March Madness, but now since we started in January, we just call it Madness.
9015855	9021138	Best 80 games of all time square off in battle and only one survives.
9021178	9022638	Last year it was Super Mario Bros.
9023038	9028161	3 and I'm officially opening the boat for nominations.
9028990	9032199	Ah, so nominations are kicking off tonight, even though it's not 2010 yet.
9032359	9035227	Are you kicking off things a little early, DMN?
9036424	9043928	Uh, yes, because I have so much, I'm going to have so much stress in January, I want to get it started now.
9044148	9047570	Well, it's your shtick, you can do whatever the hell you want, DMN, you go.
9047590	9060136	Yes, but we're changing the voting around, so there could be, like, games like Rockman and DDR, now, I know a lot of people who listen to the show are huge Bimani fans, and that's nothing against them, but
9060976	9067604	It's been a problem when DDR is seated in the top 12 and Rock Band has seated in the top 5 for consecutive years.
9068084	9080258	So we're changing the formula a little bit to keep it a little bit more fair so we don't see games like Rock Band get all the way to the final four because a lot of people are like, this game doesn't really need to be here.
9082625	9084227	What are you doing different?
9084287	9086829	Or is it a top secret formula?
9087069	9087650	It's a secret.
9087810	9088090	I see.
9088150	9089891	It's like the herbs and spices at KFC.
9089951	9091753	It's going to forever remain top secret.
9092133	9093034	It's a secret to everybody.
9093054	9096117	So go vote on something that you're not really sure how it works.
9096577	9099439	But in the end, there will be a winner that will be picked.
9099620	9100100	And Pi?
9101261	9105224	I have all the details of submitting your vote on OrangeLinesRadio.com right now.
9105364	9105624	Sweet.
9106345	9110669	If there are any questions, they can also be directed to uslmadness at gmail.com.
9111873	9115594	I'll be putting bracket details up probably in a couple of weeks.
9115694	9120656	But votes are open now, so vote early, but don't vote often because you can only vote once.
9121376	9121976	I have a question.
9122576	9122776	Yes.
9123217	9126718	My question is, why don't we just call this whole thing over and Super Metroid wins?
9126818	9128238	Because that is what should happen.
9128578	9130739	You know, I agree with you.
9130919	9132759	Super Metroid is the greatest game of all time.
9132819	9137521	I will tell you that both years, and I will even tell you this year, it will be my top vote.
9138584	9141465	but when it gets beaten by crap like Tetris.
9142325	9145926	Well, Tetris isn't crap, but it's just not Super Metroid.
9146366	9148147	It's not Super Metroid.
9148187	9150047	I also had another reason I was calling in.
9151128	9152068	Not to promote anything.
9152128	9163831	I have a beef with video game marketing and since I've finally called into this show and tuned in for the first time in like five months, my game of the year this year was Borderlands.
9164732	9165272	Hands down.
9166550	9173532	But this game didn't get a lot of press because everyone's, you know, staining their pants about Modern Warfare 2.
9173812	9174772	I'm going to be honest with you.
9174932	9177513	Modern Warfare 2 is not the best game I've played.
9178013	9179473	It is not the best game I've played this year.
9179493	9181534	It is not the best game I've played in the past five years.
9182374	9184754	Modern Warfare 2 is above average.
9185034	9185695	It's a good game.
9186715	9188955	But it's not this amazing thing people make it out to be.
9188995	9192016	The reason why it was this great thing everyone made it out to be is marketing.
9193556	9195517	I wish some of these games...
9196533	9198694	that were great got more marketing.
9199754	9214079	If Borderlands got the marketing it deserved, I think it would have sold more, people would have liked it more, and the game, from what I noticed, really got popular by a little bit of marketing and a little bit of word of mouth.
9214639	9220481	But you see games like Katamari Damacy, Psychonauts, gosh, what was the other one I had?
9220561	9222202	Okami would be a good example.
9223042	9224823	These games get fantastic reviews.
9226314	9229115	And unfortunately, in these days, that doesn't mean anything.
9229275	9230036	And it's depressing.
9231096	9231957	You know what's weird, though?
9232077	9232897	Sometimes it does.
9232957	9238220	Like, I look at a game like Braid that really did everything based off of that word amount.
9238240	9247565	But maybe that's the difference between download title and go into the store and drop $60 because, you know... And one question I usually ask people when they tell me a game's good, I say, well, is it $60 good?
9247585	9247865	Or is it...
9252186	9256227	That stems from an old game on my show that Jimmy and I did on our old show way back.
9256727	9257888	God, I don't even want to remember.
9258448	9264649	But we had a segment called Actual Retail Price where we would name games that were coming out and we would say what we would actually pay for them.
9265709	9268430	And in some cases, I'd pay more than $60 for a game.
9268450	9271131	In a lot of cases, I'd maybe pay $40 for a game.
9272051	9273451	Look at a game like World of Warcraft.
9273551	9275672	I have paid more than $60 for that game.
9275692	9277612	In fact, I've paid more than I care to admit.
9277632	9277692	Yes.
9280612	9283033	But Modern Warfare 2 was not a $60 game.
9284034	9285074	It was a $45 game.
9286155	9294039	I hate to say it, but I needed to get that out because I'm sick... And Nintendo is so guilty of this.
9296620	9297961	All I have to say is Wii Music.
9298421	9301643	They marketed this as the greatest thing since sliced bread and it was crap.
9301963	9302123	But...
9303368	9304889	and DarkSakura.com.
9328587	9333793	And I think in this decade alone, we've come to have to pay a lot more for our games.
9333833	9339700	We're paying now $60 for games, whereas at the beginning of the decade with the whole CD-based thing, we weren't paying so much before.
9340361	9342403	I will say, the first game I paid $60 for...
9343604	9369972	Street Fighter 2 on the Super Nintendo that's true first game I paid $60 for was Killer Instinct on the Super Nintendo I do realize that cartridge based games did raise that expectation earlier but CD was supposed to drop that and now it's come back up again it's very interesting we will talk about a little more of this next week as we start to kind of wrap up the year and the decade because it will be a slow news week you know that so more to come on that next week but thank you so much GMN we appreciate the call as always and keep up the good work with Under Sedation Live
9370772	9372893	I wouldn't call it good work, but we'll keep up the work.
9372953	9373994	Keep up the fair work.
9374434	9375695	Happy New Year, guys.
9375895	9378076	Hey, if Travis does come out here, you should come with him.
9378476	9379236	I'm planning on it.
9379276	9381777	We're working on synchronizing our trips.
9381858	9383498	We might have to just make it OLRCon.
9383598	9384839	We'll rent a hall or something.
9385099	9390262	We'll rent the Masonic Lodge and just throw ourselves a party.
9390322	9390922	Sounds good, man.
9390962	9391182	Take care.
9391202	9391322	Later.
9393936	9408850	that's going to do it for calls tonight sorry to those who didn't get through but remember you can't always send us an email or you can always give us an offline call or you can always send us an email bag, twitter, whatever you want to do there so sorry to those again who did not get through anyhow
9410751	9419097	We just... It's about time for us to wrap up the show, but I know Loki might have had some more last-minute stories he wants to get to, but he's too busy laughing over there at the frickin'... I'm not laughing over here.
9419197	9421839	Well, I was laughing at some stuff, but... Oh, okay.
9422059	9427242	I just... I like how they have I'm on a boat as one of the songs in there, and they have the video for it.
9427262	9427342	Nice.
9431605	9433346	Other things we'll mention real quick.
9434107	9444396	There's a game that was originally on the iPhone and the iPod Touch from a French independent developer called Press Start Studios.
9444556	9448219	It's a hack and slash game called Twin Blades, The Reaping Vanguard.
9449099	9450521	It's a really awesome looking game.
9450541	9453983	It's now coming to Xbox Live Indie Games.
9455705	9459468	I think you should pick it up just because it's incredibly beautiful.
9459548	9460549	It's all hand-drawn.
9461950	9463251	The game's coming out for $3.
9465934	9467015	Definitely worth picking up.
9467375	9468516	It looks like a pretty fun little game.
9469156	9470818	Maybe I'll have to look for the iPhone one.
9471513	9478275	Yeah, the iPhone one is actually already out now and is actually out for 99 cents.
9478715	9483157	This one will be coming out apparently on Christmas.
9483857	9484698	So the 25th.
9485818	9486418	Sounds kind of neat.
9487178	9499923	Assassin's Creed 2 is getting some download content that's going to kind of bridge the gap between the first and second games and they've added some new abilities including the Spring Jump and that's...
9501408	9507214	Apparently two different contents between the end of January and the end of February.
9507614	9513100	They're going to have the Battle of Forli and that's going to be for $3.99.
9515579	9521044	and also, I guess, Bonfire of Vanities, which will run you $4.99.
9522925	9532613	And I guess it's speculated that the two editions will fill in the missing sequence 12 and 13 from the game.
9533114	9534295	So, it's neat.
9535976	9540820	And lastly, the 3D Blu-ray specs have been finalized.
9541581	9543763	And this is going to be kind of going forward...
9545973	9558020	I don't know if they're going to start this next year, but obviously the big trend in entertainment nowadays is 3D, and they're going to be bringing that to you with Blu-ray.
9559730	9569960	And one of the things that they did include with, of course, the Blu-ray specs is going to be that the 3D will be supported on the PlayStation 3.
9570420	9575565	So soon you'll be able to, I guess, watch 3D movies on your PlayStation 3.
9575946	9577727	Makes sense since they have...
9578468	9608074	similar technology right now available for the Avatar game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 assuming you had the TV to support it and had the glasses that go with it but actually I mean some of those TVs because the Avatar game supported like all sorts of different methods for it one of which is RealD and I didn't even realize that RealD is available for TVs and those glasses are dirt cheap I mean hell you get them you know you go see a 3D movie in the theater you get a free pair of you know those polarized glasses
9608174	9610655	Aren't you supposed to turn them into the bucket at the end so they can be steamwashed?
9610675	9610955	Fuck that.
9611055	9614576	I'm paying extra money for, you know, the movie.
9615216	9616516	I'm keeping those damn glasses.
9617636	9619457	But yes, for Avatar, I did recycle them.
9619517	9621317	I did have some before, just in case.
9621517	9622077	Yeah, I stole one.
9622117	9624378	I did have a pair from Disneyland that I accidentally held on to.
9624398	9628759	If I ever get a TV, though, that does support Real D, I'm keeping those damn glasses.
9629156	9633186	Speaking of 3D and Disneyland, we've got a planned trip in February, y'all.
9633206	9634088	Guess who's coming back?
9634108	9636032	Oh my gosh, did you see Princess Tiana?
9636453	9637696	I did, I was so excited!
9639952	9642473	She let me pretend to be the prince, even though the prince was standing right there.
9642933	9643454	That's awesome.
9643494	9646915	But my female friend that was with me, she posed with the prince, so it worked out.
9646935	9648116	You should have posed with the prince, too.
9648556	9650997	I should have, but there were all these little kids around.
9651037	9656239	I don't think the parents would appreciate those types of questions, so we'll just leave it at that.
9656680	9664183	But no, I obviously had a good time, and I'm excited to go back next year because we've got to see Captain EO.
9664943	9665644	It's got to happen.
9666104	9668725	Oh, you guys, Captain EO is officially coming back in February.
9669432	9672093	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9692839	9694321	Something about that kind of caught my ear.
9694401	9697506	Like, okay, and this Captain EO thing has been announced for a limited run.
9698146	9700490	What has already been planned for next?
9700510	9704034	Because this means something's already been planned for 2011 for that theater.
9704315	9706278	So Captain EO's going to be there, but only for about a year.
9707059	9708120	Then something else is coming.
9708601	9709121	I have a theory.
9710049	9710510	I have a theory.
9710970	9711671	What is your theory?
9711751	9712833	It's Tomorrowland, right?
9713213	9713414	Yes.
9713514	9715717	Pixar is a big thing right now.
9716218	9719742	I'm going to guess it's a WALL-E movie would take that theater.
9719823	9721545	And I think a WALL-E movie would be pretty rad.
9721765	9722767	That would be awesome.
9722887	9724990	That's my bet, is a WALL-E movie replaces Captain Neo.
9726261	9730603	If it was my way, it'd be Tron, and they'd reopen the monorail and actually make it a good Tron ride.
9730683	9731403	The PeopleMover?
9731583	9733664	OMG, yes, please.
9733864	9734944	So much this.
9735345	9736445	So much this.
9737005	9746769	If it wasn't for that stupid guy who decided to dive off the wrong side of it, we would still have us a PeopleMover, and we would still have us the Tron thing, which was the only good part about the PeopleMover.
9747069	9750193	I don't want to make this the Disney show, but we're at the end of the show anyway.
9750213	9750954	There's not a lot left.
9751274	9752316	I will say this real quick.
9752396	9759644	One thing I did see at Disneyland that just opened up Friday, reopened up I should say, all new, all completely redone.
9759684	9760505	I was very impressed.
9760565	9762568	Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln is back.
9762768	9763849	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9783144	9783745	We're gonna have to do it.
9783845	9786787	Let's hope that's not Evil Lincoln, who will murder us all.
9786827	9787928	No, it's not Evil Lincoln!
9787988	9794132	I especially love the part when President Lincoln stands up and does his rendition of Lady Gaga's poker face.
9796614	9798475	Starts mimicking the Bad Romance video, yes.
9798495	9799356	It really hit me.
9799816	9801237	In the voice of Christopher Walken.
9802298	9802558	Nice.
9803899	9806721	Alright, anyhow, there you go.
9806881	9812165	That's my little snap Disney review, but they have water back at California Venture.
9813820	9816521	The main walkway at California Adventure is closed.
9816561	9817961	You have to go all the way around to get anywhere.
9819341	9821042	California Adventure, I have a cry.
9821122	9824503	But they really are getting that park ready for 2011.
9825223	9826103	It's going to be awesome.
9826563	9827143	It's going to be awesome.
9827964	9829044	Aladdin is also closing.
9829244	9832705	It's announced that the Aladdin show at California Adventure is going to close in August.
9832845	9834165	It's probably going to Broadway.
9834465	9835205	Don't cry too much.
9835285	9836926	It's in London's West End right now.
9837866	9839186	Pam Anderson is playing the genie.
9839486	9840467	Which, what?
9840627	9841007	But okay.
9841027	9841067	Um...
9842307	9844412	but a Toy Story musical is going to replace it.
9844953	9845414	That's cool.
9845575	9846357	Yeah, so we'll see.
9846798	9850286	Well, you know, Toy Story 3 is in the works.
9851934	9857760	So... Oh, I'll say about Toy Story 3, they're actually going to be doing an IMAX releases for that.
9857860	9858521	Oh yeah, the 3D.
9858561	9860363	Yeah, they did the 3D preview for it.
9860623	9861204	So, good times.
9861344	9863706	And, you know, again, how does this relate to video games?
9864067	9865348	Movie-video game tie-ins.
9865428	9871615	And the technology, just like Loki's saying about Avatar, you know, this type of technology you're seeing in Avatar is already in the game.
9871675	9874197	It's just that it's probably too expensive for a lot of you guys to afford.
9874758	9875338	3D, Midway Mania
9894403	9895544	Probably do a little bit of both.
9895984	9897544	I'm not sure if we'll have any special guests yet.
9897564	9898845	I'm going to try to line up some folks.
9898885	9900226	We'll see what happens over the next week.
9900266	9905908	But we will be back live again on All Games Radio on the 27th with our last episode of The Decade.
9907148	9910770	If you can believe it, we've been doing this show most of the decade.
9911870	9912951	That's kind of strange.
9913976	9915857	Well, we've hit seven years.
9916518	9916818	I know.
9916918	9919560	Next year will be the eighth year of broadcasting.
9919580	9923802	2002 to 2010 and beyond.
9923962	9924562	We're bored.
9926043	9931567	Anyhow, before we close up shop tonight, of course, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts here in studio.
9931607	9933187	So, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
9933888	9934648	I want cupcakes.
9936049	9937050	You guys and cupcakes.
9937570	9941672	My final thought is, at the grocery store, there's a box that says Betty Crocker on it.
9941852	9942453	It'll help you out.
9944333	9945394	Loki, your final thought, please.
9947775	9948115	I don't know.
9949676	9951237	Tiara, your final thought, please.
9951277	9952857	Thank you so much for being here tonight.
9953178	9954298	Let me borrow that top.
9955319	9955599	Betch.
9956039	9957300	You guys see the backside.
9957320	9958360	I'm wearing my Kelly shirt tonight.
9958740	9959521	Don't be a betch.
9960141	9960701	That's great.
9961022	9961262	All right.
9961402	9963443	And Loki, your final thought tonight.
9964103	9964863	He just said he didn't know.
9964903	9965764	I thought he had a real one.
9965784	9966844	He forfeited it.
9967145	9967985	He started to say something.
9968045	9969006	I don't really have anything.
9969026	9969306	Okay.
9969326	9969746	Well, then fine.
9972128	9972469	That's it.
9972829	9973690	We're going to close up shop.
9974031	9974571	See you next week.
9974612	9975373	We're going to do it all again.
9975413	9979058	Our 350th decade end episode.
9979318	9980360	Rob better bring cupcakes.
