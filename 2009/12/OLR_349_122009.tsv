0	19540	Today, December 20th, 2009, is a leaked survey hinting at a paid Playstation network?
19540	31600	What video game related show will soon be on PBS?
31600	35040	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35040	36040	Radio.
36040	40200	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
40200	41200	lifestyle.
41200	44720	With you as always over the next few hours here on All Games Radio where we tape live.
44720	50200	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me is the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
50200	51200	How are you?
51200	52200	I'm alright.
52200	53200	You alright?
53200	54200	Hi.
54200	55200	A little irritated.
55200	56420	I'm sorry to hear that.
56420	57420	Not at me?
57420	58420	Did I do something?
58420	59420	No.
59420	60420	Okay, I was just saying if I ruffled your feathers I'm extremely sorry.
60420	61420	No.
61420	62420	Not at you.
62420	64120	Well the show hasn't really started yet so maybe at the end of the show you'll be mad
64120	65120	at me.
65120	66120	We'll see.
66120	67120	Mom.
67120	68440	I'll try not to though.
68440	71640	Alright and of course say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
71640	72640	Hi.
72640	74160	Who's chowing down on wings right now.
74160	75160	Yes.
75160	76160	Alright.
76160	77160	He's barbecuing.
77160	78160	He's been craving them all week.
78160	79160	Have you really?
79160	80160	Yeah.
80160	81160	Now the whole room smells like barbecue and damn I am hungry.
81160	82160	That's alright.
82160	83160	They're yummy.
83160	84160	Maybe I'll get a taco after the show.
84160	85160	Well thank you.
85160	86160	That makes me feel a lot better to know.
86160	87160	At least you're having yummy food.
87160	88160	How have you been Loki?
88160	89160	I've been fine.
89160	90160	Alright.
90160	98840	We are back of course on Sunday night taping live at All Games Radio www.allgames.com.
98840	103060	We tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, or thereabouts right after the Bobby
103060	104440	Black Wolf show.
104440	108160	Our old friend Bobby Black Wolf who does a one man band show right before us at 5 o'clock
108160	109200	Pacific.
109200	111920	Although we're starting a little late tonight because we were talking about Game of the
111920	113040	Decade with Bobby.
113040	116180	That was kind of the focus of his show tonight because he's got next week off.
116180	118760	And we were talking about Game of the Decade a little bit on his show.
118760	122760	So if you haven't already listened to his show for the week, be sure you do at some
122760	127280	point by checking out thebobbyblackwolfshow.com and downloading his show because we make
127280	128280	a cameo.
128280	129280	I don't know if you guys know this.
129280	132200	We make a cameo on his show like every week that we have a show as well.
132200	135800	He's been very good about always kind of having a little toss over to us live.
135800	139920	So please support our friend Bobby Black Wolf and also the other fabulous programs they
139920	140920	have at All Games Radio.
140920	141920	And I always say this.
141920	147160	If this is your first time listening to All Games Radio or listening to Orange Lounge
147160	150220	Radio which is a part of that, if this is your first time listening to this show because
150220	153840	maybe a friend sent you over here and you don't know really what the show is about and
153840	157200	you decide to listen to this show tonight, damn these guys suck.
157200	160280	They don't talk about anything I really want to hear about and the games they play are
160280	161440	not the games I play.
161440	162440	You know what?
162440	166800	Go check out a different show at All Games Radio because there's lots of great independently
166800	169320	produced shows that do talk about those other games.
169320	173120	I'm going to admit we're not really going to bring you a lot of chat on Modern Warfare
173120	174120	2.
174120	175120	It's just not the kind of game I play.
175120	178560	I don't think Dark Soccer is really down with the Call of Duty's of the world.
178560	179560	I like Call of Duty.
179560	180560	Do you?
180560	182280	I get motion sick but I like watching Dan play.
182280	183280	Okay well fair enough then.
183280	187360	But you know we have differing opinions sometimes and I'm not saying that's a bad game.
187360	188360	Heck no.
188360	192160	It's not really a game I have time to play because there's so many other games I try
192160	195840	to squeeze in, both retro and current games.
195840	200160	Anyhow, speaking of games, let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the games
200160	201160	that we've been playing this week.
201160	202160	Dark Sakura.
202160	207040	I played Super Mario Wii which is pretty cool if annoying playing multiplayer.
207040	211440	I don't know I just found the multiplayer aspect to be really irritating so it wasn't
211440	214120	fun for me that way.
214120	219680	And a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 which if you ignore the whole Civil War
219680	222120	storyline it's actually a really fun game.
222120	224520	I hated the Civil War storyline so.
224520	227200	I'm so glad you finally got around to that because I knew we were talking on last week's
227200	228200	show kind of joking.
228200	231680	I still haven't played this game but I'm glad you finally were able to do it.
231680	234280	We played a decent bit of it.
234280	246560	And I played of course my peggle a bunch and some solitaire and Dan was showing us the
246560	252920	whole zombie thing in Borderlands and doing the brain hunting thing and like it's kind
252920	258000	of funny because the more you have to go back you like find this the one of the characters
258000	262160	buddies who's been turned into a zombie and he's tied to his chair so you have to bring
262160	265640	him brains to eat and he keeps asking for more brains.
265640	271040	So as you you start bringing him you know 10 brains and 25 and 50 and as it keeps going
271040	282160	the eh it goes brains for the name of the thing and but I really I don't know I think
282160	285760	I would be happier playing Mario Wii by myself.
285760	286800	It just.
286800	290800	It can get a little frustrating with you know all the chaos going on.
290800	295480	It gets a lot of frustrating because all I want to do is just to do what I'm doing you
295480	298400	know and it's irritating.
298400	302440	It's a bummer there's not a game like that on the DS where everybody can kind of do their
302440	306440	own thing on their own screen but yet maybe you're still working together and I think
306440	309480	it's for that real element that you're stuck on that screen.
309480	313280	I mean it's both a blessing and a curse you know.
313280	315640	Well if that is it for your gaming week.
315640	318480	Oh yeah and I played some World of Warcraft.
318480	319480	There you go.
319480	322160	And how about the one and only Techmaster Loki.
322160	326420	I didn't play a whole lot this week and not as much as I'd want to finishing up Christmas
326420	328580	gifts and stuff.
328580	339000	So I played you know Grand Theft Auto, Baligate Tony multiplayer kicking ass constantly in
339000	340000	that game.
340000	341000	There's.
341000	344800	It's funny because we play with you know we've been playing ranked matches now so anybody
344800	354480	can join us is you know play around 10 o'clock you know Pacific and 3 p.m. Pacific each day.
354480	359440	So if you just pretty much just join a you know ranked deathmatch game you're probably
359440	361360	going to get into ours.
361360	366840	And it's funny because we laugh at the people that play with us because most of the time
366840	370040	they end up dropping because we're just so intense in the game.
370040	372800	I mean not that we're talking trash them we don't have microphones or anything but we
372800	376200	just kick the crap out of everybody.
376200	380000	Mainly I kick the crap out of everybody but you know there's a little bit coming my way
380000	382620	but it's funny.
382620	385440	And I don't know.
385440	389960	Anyways other than that we've been playing I played more Bayonetta and it's awesome.
389960	393200	I like some of this stuff later on in the game.
393200	397260	You can actually buy new techniques and stuff and one of the techniques I unlocked is like
397260	401880	windmill you know like the breakdancing moves so you spin around with the guns blazing on
401880	405720	your feet or whatever and then she stops and does a freeze pose.
405720	407040	It's awesome.
407040	409120	It's this game is awesome.
409120	411600	I know I'm so excited.
411600	420080	And then completely off of the Xbox 360 I actually played a little bit of salt which
420080	423280	is the new game that's in sodium one.
423280	428120	Honestly had no idea what the hell sodium is and to be honest and I know we're going
428120	433320	to talk about this more later on it wasn't that big a deal to me.
433320	434320	I don't know.
434320	439680	I played that game salt kind of like a hovercraft action game or something like that where you're
439680	444920	blowing up other robotic hovercrafts and stuff and it was neat for a little bit.
444920	450360	You know that's it but it's not something I'd like consistently play.
450360	452440	Well I know we're going to get into it a little later in the show.
452440	456920	I played a little bit of that this week as well and you know although I think the game
456920	461320	itself was a little like I think I played a game like this on the Atari 2600 so this
461320	462840	is a little more souped up you know.
462840	468640	I think technically it's doing some things that we haven't seen home do yet and it's
468640	472040	kind of exciting but we'll get into that a little later.
472040	475080	So yeah that's basically it.
475080	481200	I was going to play some other games on my main cabinet I did try I wanted to play alligator
481200	486160	which is our alligator hunt which I've never heard of the game but it's pretty cool it's
486160	494640	kind of like a shooter I guess an on rails shooter thing and it was kind of neat but
494640	499640	I can't get the ROM to work right I'm doing something wrong with my settings or something
499640	505720	but I don't know it'll be cool.
505720	509560	Well let's see my gaming week obviously if you were listening to last week's show I got
509560	515320	that awesome FC Mobile as a gift for the holidays and I went out on a little bit of a binge
515320	521320	I bought some 8-bit games and I borrowed from the vault so I had NES games galore back at
521320	526320	home including an awesome purchase I made at a local games store I went to where you
526320	530040	suggested Jamie and I don't know if I told you what I got there I don't think I did after
530040	534040	last week but I went to that store we talked about and I don't know if you want to say
534040	540900	it on air or not but I went and got Goonies 2 on the NES which is a game I just remember
540900	545520	for you know it wasn't a spectacular I think when it came out but I think it was also underrated
545520	548640	because a lot of people said what the hell does this have to do with the movie but it
548640	554720	actually was a pretty cool game I also bought Slippeed for the Sega CD which I knew which
554720	559800	I knew Dark Sakura would very much approve of I haven't been able to hook that all up
559800	563240	because I don't have the Sega CD hooked up and I've been very lazy on that because I
563240	568680	was out of town this weekend but that's on my to-do list for the week but 8-bit games
568680	574480	yes I've been binging on a lot of those Rygar on the NES I borrowed from the vault Guardian
574480	580960	Legend of course came from Loki with the system and also picked up which I think is Faxanadu
580960	584640	but I think it's actually Fashanadu or something like that I think the X has a different pronunciation
584640	590440	to it which is a game I remember from my childhood also borrowed that from the vault good times
590440	595120	good 8-bit times so I'm like totally reminiscing this week going to our chat room of course
595120	601000	chat.orangeloungeradio.com the always present fourth guest on the show also commenting on
601000	605480	what's going on tonight start off with Tiger Claw tonight Goonies 2 is a great platform
605480	611400	game but it had those annoying 3D sections yeah especially the front and back thing got
611400	616860	really irritating but you know it wasn't perfect but it still was a game that's out of my memory
616860	621880	but I get what he's saying also as far as my gaming week goes not a whole lot of other
621880	626480	new stuff a little bit of World of Warcraft a little bit of DJ Hero I played that earlier
626480	630640	in the week and got some trophies because I really like DJ Hero it's one of my favorite
630640	635160	games to have come out this year and I don't understand why people are like hating why
635160	640120	it's cool to hate on DJ Hero all of a sudden because maybe it's not selling zillions of
640120	645920	copies like Guitar Hero and Rock Band do I mean I think a lot of this came from those
645920	650520	silly VGA awards that happened was it last week oh yeah that's right because we were
650520	655580	live Saturday not Sunday they happened I guess later Saturday night whatever who cares right
655580	660920	it's just what some people claim to think is the best game of the year when that's an
660920	667160	opinion left to the individual but I guess it created a stir that DJ Hero won best music
667160	673660	game over the Rock Band Beatles I think one can admit they're both really good music games
673660	677700	not to hate on Rock Band Beatles I think it's an amazing game but you know you did have
677700	688480	an existing song list granted you know songs of a generation just huge songs in an existing
688480	694720	engine whereas I think DJ Hero did something new and had some pretty awesome songs I mean
694720	699200	I'm not hating on either game I just think DJ Hero is not as horrible as some of the
699200	702200	haters are making it out to be all of a sudden I would have given it to DJ Hero too and I
702200	707260	think a lot of people like following you in the negative press or whatever and they like
707260	712600	to be right so you know they try to agree with the majority you know because they don't
712600	716520	want to be challenged and stuff like that so that's a lot of it that's why you hear
716520	721200	a lot of people echoing the same you know thoughts because if none of those stats were
721200	726120	posted online or how the internet didn't exist you know these people probably wouldn't think
726120	731480	too poorly upon the game well you know what I say haters to the left because you ain't
731480	738200	right that's right you can quote me on that too that's really it otherwise I also oh one
738200	742120	other quick thing steam's having a big sale this weekend and torchlight is half off and
742120	745320	I played the demo which I talked about a few weeks ago on the show about three weeks ago
745320	750320	or so and I I indulged and bought the full version of that game and I'm very excited
750320	756320	to play that later when I get home so next week I'm sure I'll be talking about that anyhow
756320	760280	that pretty much does it for our gaming weeks a little bit of housekeeping tonight we have
760280	763840	there's actually some big news in housekeeping first the little yet important things out
763840	768880	of the way if you're not following us on twitter please do twitter.com slash olr is our twitter

783000	787320	have been spreading the word to friends and all that so thank you guys so much to everyone
787320	790880	who's contributed to that and helping spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because
790880	796920	you know we do do this show for free speaking of spreading the word how awesome is this
796920	803200	the community myself Jamie Matt we have nothing to do with this honestly I mean we didn't
803200	808000	we didn't help with this we didn't contribute to this but I'll be damned if we don't love
808000	813840	this and support this and that is this olr revolution second mix I'm sure you guys are
813840	817520	familiar this has been on the front of our site and I think it came up last week it's
817520	824440	this DDR step mania skin that has an orange lounge radio theme to it and they've taken
824440	828800	all these songs from the cage match segment if you've ever listened to the show live you
828800	833080	know what that is or kind of inside jokes like I don't know if like the Daytona theme
833080	837920	is in the game but it probably is you know things that are like jokes on this show and
837920	844880	have put them into this yo DDR step mania thing and I guess John or DMN from understation
844880	847720	live did all the announcer voices because you know when when orange launch radio was
847720	851280	a station that show was on our station so you know that's certainly a part of the oil
851280	857480	our family too it's just this whole thing that we didn't do it I wish I could be sitting
857480	861960	here saying hey you should download this game because dark soccer Loki myself worked very
861960	866600	hard on it and you know it's it's what we do but no no it's all the community and the
866600	873960	people on our forums that did this and I'm gonna tell you right up don't expect a VGA
873960	878320	award-winning type of game here I mean it is there's some very silly things in there
878320	883440	I've seen some of the videos on the YouTube channel that they have I believe it's ol revolution
883440	889040	some of the youtubes they have up I I have to admit I've been given an advance copy of
889040	891300	the game but because I was out of town this weekend I didn't get a chance to check it
891300	895200	out so sorry but I saw that I did watch the videos and just looking at some of the songs
895200	901320	that are in it like I'm just I'm facepalming because like they found shit that I did live
901320	905960	where I would sing along to songs because I was that bored and that's what was funny
905960	910960	back in 2002 when we were first learning how to broadcast somebody saved that shit and
910960	917400	is now in this game I mean how embarrassing karaoke I should I should old karaoke I should
917400	924000	not be encouraged God if like a prayer showed up in there I'm gonna die Rob what is it Loki
924000	929400	is like a prayer in there I think it is fuck I found the video for it fuck like seriously
929400	934880	I should not be encouraging people to seek this out it's okay the time that you guys
934880	938880	wanted to do you know the funny stuff again remember we tried to yeah give me the sinker
938880	944960	okey again yeah so oops I did it again is in there as well so great so yeah we I'm
944960	948900	sure we all have a little bit of embarrassment in there but okay whatever you know I can
948900	953360	look past the silliness and the fact that you know what they're doing it cuz you know
953360	958440	somebody thought it was cool as as dumb as it was and they made a game out of it I think
958440	966360	it's awesome and it's such like as individuals who have been doing this for free for going
966360	970500	on eight years now and not really seeing any money out of this in fact oftentimes losing
970500	975080	a lot of money into this it's that that's like total reward right there so thank you
975080	978640	guys so much to the community and everybody that put that together I understand it is
978640	986200	coming out Christmas Eve so stay tuned 1224 of 09 to orange lounge radio.com I think they're
986200	989400	putting the finishing touches on that right now so thank you so much to the community
989400	992560	for putting that together we might get some phone calls of that later I know I gotta tell
992560	996120	earlier in the show about one of the developers behind it is going to call in and tell us
996120	1002840	all about it and so we'll find out some more anyhow that's all I have for housekeeping
1002840	1010160	sorta I want to get into the news tonight but first I want to talk about this because
1010160	1016080	this didn't make the show world tonight because dark Sakura and Loki really kind of did things
1016080	1019640	because I was out this weekend so I'm thanks to everybody for picking up the slack because
1019640	1024120	I wasn't here but I saw something on the internet literally in the 15 minutes I was home between
1024120	1026960	the time I got back from LA and the time I came over to do orange laundry tonight that
1026960	1031040	pissed me off and so obviously didn't make the show world because because the others
1031040	1037400	didn't know about it but I have to say something about it because I'm so angry at this that
1037400	1042480	I have to say something about it and it has to do with something I actually saw on Kotaku
1042480	1046040	but it's not Kotaku I'm mad at in fact I think they're great there's lots of great video
1046040	1049240	game blogs out there that I check regularly as I'm sure most of you do and Kotaku is one
1049240	1053940	of them and when I was home for a few minutes I checked the site in my reader and saw that
1053940	1060400	they had just run a story about out magazines gayest games ever list or I think the actual
1060400	1065300	name of the list is the gayest video games that they put together this list that is running
1065300	1072920	on out magazine very little journalistic contents content to this nobody signed the article
1072920	1077460	so I don't know who did it but and if you read it you can pretty much figure out why
1077460	1085080	I really shouldn't be encouraging you to seek this out because this list is not only stupid
1085080	1092040	but it's so stupid it's offensive I am offended by this article you want to know why listen
1092040	1097360	to such gem excerpts such as this the gayest video games obviously I can't read the entire
1097360	1103000	article but it's because it's copyright but for you know purposes of criticism I can cite
1103000	1108400	certain pieces of it Super Mario Brothers makes the list which they put a video of Super
1108400	1118720	Mario Brothers 3 but they describe Super Mario Brothers cleaning pipes and taking names get
1118720	1127520	it because like cleaning pipes is like a euphemism for gay sex that's so funny let's see moving
1127520	1133680	on with this Contra two bare-chested dudes on a mission neither can accomplish without
1133680	1138800	the other widely thought to have influenced any products before she penned the short story
1138800	1152560	to Brokeback Mountain so you don't have to play the game with two people and anyone that
1152560	1158840	has spent enough time with this game kind of knows that right yeah let's see what else
1158840	1165080	oh here was my favorite this is the last one I'm gonna read here burger time the yeah burger
1165080	1172000	time is apparently a gay video game the slap some meat between those buns tagline was jettisoned
1172000	1178900	for the less memorable let's get cooking but this 1982 arcade title was created as a witty
1178900	1185760	and fun commentary on the closeted state of male-to-male sexuality in the early 1980s no
1185760	1196080	it wasn't it's about a fucking hamburger really really you are a gay magazine and you are
1196080	1202460	reinforcing these stereotypes that we have all come to hate and despise and try to fight
1202460	1208760	against in the wake of things like proposition 8 in California and proposition 1 in Maine
1208760	1213620	and I'm sorry I'm getting loud to those in studio but that's how mad I get like the this
1213620	1220360	mentality sets back what we've tried to accomplish by going back to these schoolyard tactics
1220360	1226300	of well if X&Y is true then teehee you must be gay because so-and-so talks with the lisp
1226300	1231180	you're a faggot do you know how many times I had to hear that growing up and what you're
1231180	1235880	doing in this magazine article is that any better because they're bare-chested dudes
1235880	1242560	going on an adventure together this makes this a gay video game I'm sorry I find that
1242560	1249040	to be offensive nowhere here in this article does it talk about Dragon Age a game where
1249040	1254060	you can have a same gender relationship if you want or not your choice or how about what
1254060	1258100	I consider to be one of the most landmark games for homosexual content ever made The
1258100	1265200	Sims yeah if you want to have a gay relationship go for it if you don't don't what you do in
1265200	1272000	your walls is your choice does that game come up in this article no because to some junior
1272000	1277400	high school graduate here it's apparently not funny but putting a list of games in a
1277400	1283760	blender that are apparently popular and finding deal it's like it's like a four-year-old trying
1283760	1287800	to force and I said this is part of my comment which by the way funny funny hasn't posted
1287800	1291560	yet because it has to screen for editorial so watch this content won't appear but as
1291560	1295820	I said in the comment it's like trying to watch a four-year-old jam a square peg into
1295820	1299760	a round hole you're creating a list of reasons why they're gay you know it's like when you
1299760	1307120	read these piss me off to when these gay rags do this they post a list of oh well Jake Gyllenhaal
1307120	1313960	must be gay because he bottomed for Heath Ledger or he looks good without a shirt off
1313960	1321200	you know or whatever reason they pick up how is that any better from what you faced as
1321200	1326000	a homosexual man or a bisexual man or somebody in the minority your entire life how is what
1326000	1332020	you're saying any better than that because you do one thing you must be gay this list
1332020	1337780	is stupid this list is has nothing to do with gay people it has nothing to do with video
1337780	1343800	games it's insulting and I denounce it and if you are a gay man listening to this show
1343800	1346880	which I've been blessed amongst the seven or eight years to meet many gay people that
1346880	1351480	listen to the show and have said many nice things about you know what we do here and
1351480	1356560	all that stuff you should be fucking pissed to hit you are a straight man who plays video
1356560	1360000	games you should be fucking pissed at this because they don't know what the hell they're
1360000	1364760	talking about an out magazine if you want to write about video games and hire someone
1364760	1368880	who knows what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to video games and has the balls
1368880	1372800	to sign their articles and has the balls to sign their article and has and is going to
1372800	1381240	sign a check that they're asking cash no pun intended it's just ridiculous I mean my
1381240	1385240	Oh my God, if Joe and Niki had been on the list, at least I could see that.
1385240	1388240	I mean, I would think that's a little stupid, but come on.
1388240	1391240	Jamie, Loki, am I crazy? Do I have a point?
1391240	1395240	No, you're not crazy. Is that magazine, though, just for men, specifically?
1395240	1399240	Out Magazine? I don't know. I don't subscribe. I hear it's been around forever.
1399240	1403240	But clearly you can understand why I'm not going to subscribe to these types of magazines.
1403240	1406240	As a woman, I'm actually kind of offended by that, too.
1406240	1415240	I believe Out is specifically targeted at gay men, but I'm sure they're not going to say no to a lesbian who wants to buy it.
1415240	1424240	I just think that that's completely baffling and silly that they could even pass something like that and think that it would be actually funny.
1424240	1433240	I mean, if the whole list is strictly for parody, it should say parody, and then maybe. It might be remotely funny.
1433240	1441240	It still would be about as funny as World War II. It's not funny.
1441240	1443240	I'm trying to play devil's advocate.
1443240	1444240	I understand.
1444240	1449240	That would be the only thing that I could remotely see something like that maybe passing to be posted.
1449240	1457240	Oh, no, this is satire. This is parody. This is us making fun of other people by sort of the Colbert action, you know what I mean?
1457240	1461240	How he makes fun of Republicans by acting like an uber-Republican.
1461240	1466240	But other than that, if there's no type of disclaimer about that, then no.
1466240	1471240	In fact, actually, I would say don't just post a comment on there.
1471240	1475240	Actually get their address and mail something in.
1475240	1481240	I'm curious to see. Just for sake, real quick, I know we're pushed for time tonight, but I just want to read what I said on the article.
1481240	1482240	Because you may not see this.
1482240	1483240	Yeah.
1483240	1485240	If you see this, then they let it run.
1485240	1487240	We'll post it up on our forums, too.
1487240	1488240	Here's the comment I made.
1488240	1494240	As a gay man and a long-time gaming enthusiast, I find this meat compilation to be not only horribly misinformed but offensive.
1494240	1498240	Nowhere on this list are games mentioned that actually meant anything to gay representation in games.
1498240	1500240	Love who you want to love in The Sims.
1500240	1502240	Choose to have a same-gender night of passion in Dragon Age.
1502240	1503240	Or not.
1503240	1510240	Not even a frickin' bone tossed at controversial gay content in games such as the hidden kiss in Bully or the lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect.
1510240	1517240	This article looks like an extremely casual gamer took a list of games that they actually remembered playing as a child, threw them in a blender,
1517240	1521240	and like a four-year-old trying to put a square peg in a round hole, invented a reason why the game is gay.
1521240	1524240	It's the equivalent of saying if X is true, well, then it must be gay.
1524240	1528240	Such as if so-and-so talks with a lisp and has a six-pack, well, they must be gay.
1528240	1533240	No one likes a stereotype, so why a magazine like this would sink to such a juvenile level is ridiculous.
1533240	1537240	Shame on you for the space-filling, attention-grabbing, immature piece of garbage.
1537240	1539240	Because that's what it is. It is garbage.
1539240	1543240	And I'm mad because I'm so disappointed.
1543240	1545240	I am so disappointed.
1545240	1552240	I'm sure whoever wrote this article, assuming they're gay, hell, assuming they're straight working in a gay magazine,
1552240	1556240	at some point in their life has had a stereotype passed on to them.
1556240	1561240	And to just turn around and post this crap in the face of that is disappointing.
1561240	1563240	It's so disappointing that I'm angry.
1563240	1568240	Out, do the right thing, and renounce this article and apologize.
1568240	1570240	I demand it.
1570240	1576240	And if you demand it too, which you should, out.com.
1576240	1578240	And I don't know. I could read the whole-
1578240	1580240	Call for a boycott until we do.
1580240	1584240	Just go to the website and tell someone you're pissed, because I know I'm pissed.
1584240	1586240	Anyhow.
1586240	1589240	Maybe I will send us a letter to the editor. I don't know.
1589240	1592240	Black Wolf says in chat I would send us a letter to the editor.
1592240	1594240	Maybe I should. I don't know.
1594240	1596240	We'll see what happens tomorrow.
1596240	1601240	Remember, remember. I think whether or not it's posted, you should still send it to the editor.
1601240	1611240	Because keep in mind, what's one of the big things that I personally believe by is that if you don't bring something to the attention of someone who can do something about it, then it's just going to keep going on.
1611240	1613240	Okay, fair enough. Here's what I'll do.
1613240	1619240	I will write a letter to the editor if all of you who are just as pissed off as I am will write a letter to the editor too.
1619240	1622240	I still think you should write it despite everything, but I mean, I'll write one.
1622240	1624240	I'm trying to encourage everyone.
1624240	1626240	No, everyone. I'll write one.
1626240	1630240	Great. Great. Then we have a cause.
1630240	1633240	This is a much more important cause than President Cat, might I add.
1633240	1635240	But President Cat's pretty damn important.
1635240	1638240	President Cat is pretty damn awesome.
1638240	1643240	Honestly, I want to say this again, because I know not everybody who listens to this show is gay. Duh.
1643240	1646240	I know we have tons of straight guys, straight gals that listen to this program.
1646240	1649240	Honestly, if you're a straight guy, this list should piss you off too.
1649240	1653240	Straight guys. I know there's some that listen. Straight guys that do musical theater.
1653240	1658240	How many times have you been called gay just because you do musical theater and you like music and you like all that stuff?
1658240	1663240	Honestly, if you think about what's going on here, it's the same thing.
1663240	1664240	Yeah.
1664240	1669240	And you should be offended. You might be more pissed off than I am, honestly.
1669240	1673240	Contra being an inspiration for Brokeback Mountain, please.
1673240	1677240	The book was written?
1677240	1681240	I think the book was probably written before that game ever came out. I'm not sure.
1681240	1684240	I'll have to find out. But yeah, it's just ridiculous.
1684240	1687240	Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
1687240	1693240	I mean, I was in band and I played softball for a little while.
1693240	1697240	Question in the chat room. What about bisexuals or pansexuals or asexuals?
1697240	1702240	Anyone who hates stereotypes should be offended by this article.
1702240	1708240	So if you hate bisexual stereotypes, you know, like bisexual or just bisexual because they're sluts.
1708240	1709240	That's a stereotype.
1709240	1711240	No, no, no. This is what I get.
1711240	1716240	Or asexuals or asexual because they can't get any. That's a stereotype. Just like these.
1716240	1722240	This is the stuff that I get. I'm married, but I've had girlfriends in the past.
1722240	1728240	And it's just like, oh, well, you're married now, so you're not. It doesn't change.
1728240	1732240	It just means I found someone I fell in love with. It doesn't change anything.
1732240	1736240	So I'm totally pissed off by that.
1736240	1738240	Just do whatever.
1738240	1745240	I hate stereotypes. I may bring up a stereotype just to make fun of the fact that it exists.
1745240	1751240	Because I think that if you can't laugh at something, then you're taking life too seriously.
1751240	1755240	I laugh at the lack of intelligence on that part of these people.
1755240	1758240	I laugh because it's sad and pathetic.
1758240	1762240	But there is a time when things do go too far, I think.
1762240	1768240	Especially from a, quote, trusted resource.
1768240	1770240	Just honestly, honestly, and I'll leave it with this.
1770240	1774240	And I know Loki's sitting over there very quiet, probably waiting to get into gaming news.
1774240	1775240	But let me say this.
1775240	1779240	Honestly, just do whatever the fuck you want to do.
1779240	1783240	Kids, go do whatever the fuck you want to do.
1783240	1784240	Except camels.
1784240	1787240	Just as long as you don't hurt other people.
1787240	1792240	And this article hurts.
1792240	1795240	Right, Loki?
1795240	1796240	Sure.
1796240	1797240	Alright.
1797240	1798240	He has meat.
1798240	1800240	No, I was going to let you do gaming news.
1800240	1804240	No, it's fine. I didn't really have anything to contribute.
1804240	1806240	Am I right? It's stupid.
1806240	1811240	I saw the article when I was looking for stories.
1811240	1813240	I was like, eh, no list.
1813240	1814240	Skip right past it.
1814240	1817240	And that's pretty much, you know...
1817240	1820240	So you had the journalistic integrity to go, this is stupid, skip. Right?
1820240	1822240	I didn't even have to read the list. I just saw the list.
1822240	1824240	No, gay is video games.
1824240	1826240	That's dumb. Okay, next.
1826240	1827240	Well, I clicked it because I was...
1827240	1832240	Honestly, my curiosity was, oh, I wonder if Dragon Age got really high because it's a new game.
1832240	1834240	Because I'm thinking, oh, this is going to be like a...
1834240	1837240	And then when I read it, I was like, my jaw hit the floor.
1837240	1838240	I was like, I can't believe...
1838240	1841240	Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to spend 20 minutes of the show ranting about it.
1841240	1845240	We can talk about real gaming news now. Real gaming news, folks. Real gaming news.
1845240	1852240	Anyways, let's start things off with Out Magazine's top gay games list.
1852240	1853240	Oh, wait, no.
1853240	1858240	So yes, as rumored and as we've been talking about before,
1858240	1867240	the water expansion for LittleBigPlanet is going to be hitting the PlayStation Network before Christmas.
1867240	1869240	And it is coming out this week.
1869240	1873240	And to kind of tie with it, and I'm surprised I didn't think of it before,
1873240	1876240	you'll be getting the Pirates of the Caribbean content.
1876240	1882240	Yes, much like they did with the Metal Gear Solid pack in introducing the Painator,
1882240	1886240	the water pack will be coming with a Pirates of the Caribbean level pack
1886240	1890240	to kind of introduce all the elements that are with the water.
1890240	1894240	And those will be out on the PlayStation Network on the 22nd.
1894240	1899240	And including with that will be a six-pack of Pirates costumes including Jack Sparrow,
1899240	1905240	Davy Jones, Will Turner, and some of the other characters in the actual movie.
1905240	1909240	And also you can get a free cannibal costume as well if you don't want to buy any of that stuff.
1909240	1912240	At the very least you get a free cannibal costume.
1912240	1914240	And I can't wait to buy this.
1914240	1919240	I'm so glad after such a sad, angry news item that we have something that makes me happy again.
1919240	1923240	And this makes me happy that LittleBigPlanet is still getting some love all this time later.
1923240	1925240	And I know this has been sprinkled throughout the past few shows.
1925240	1927240	Isn't it weird that this game is a year old
1927240	1930240	and I seriously think LittleBigPlanet has come up every show for like the past month
1930240	1934240	leading up to this, the release of this pack, and I think it's going to be awesome.
1934240	1938240	I'm excited to see how water is going to change the game, especially in the fan levels.
1938240	1941240	I mean, don't get me wrong, the Pirates levels are probably going to be awesome
1941240	1945240	because the Metal Gear Solid levels, that was some of the best bargain DLC.
1945240	1949240	It was almost like playing a new game for seven, eight bucks.
1949240	1951240	I'm excited to see what this is going to bring.
1951240	1955240	Definitely. And it's going to be five pirate themed levels.
1955240	1960240	They're going to have four new audio tracks in there, new backgrounds, and that kind of stuff.
1960240	1967240	And I just can't wait to play it. Seriously, this week is going to be awesome.
1967240	1975240	To kind of go with that, real quick, a little bit LittleBigPlanet related, but not.
1975240	1983240	There was an advertisement for LittleBigPlanet accessories for the PSP, and this is straight from Sony.
1983240	1991240	Funny thing about that is, that advertisement lists the PSP 4000 on top of the PSP Go.
1991240	1993240	Huh.
1993240	2002240	So perhaps they're going to have another reiteration of the PSP coming out.
2002240	2007240	Even though the Go is where it's at now, right?
2007240	2011240	Even though it's still listed on there, but it's actually separate from the PSP Go.
2011240	2021240	It's the PSP 4000. And I remember back a while ago, they had some graphics for the PSP 4000 as well, a little icon for it, months ago.
2021240	2030240	So, much like other Sony rumors, I'm going to say that probably we're going to hear about the PSP 4000 within the next few months.
2030240	2037240	That's really surprising to me, because I would think with the Go, as much of a hard time as we've given it on this program,
2037240	2040240	you'd think that if the company really believes in it, they're going to put all their might behind it.
2040240	2047240	But to kind of come out and say, oh well, we're going to go back to the old design and the 4000, which implies by nature that it's like the 3000,
2047240	2053240	but with some changes, just like all the other iterations before it, that they're going to go away.
2053240	2056240	In other words, this sounds like it's going to be a UMD-enabled machine.
2056240	2065240	Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if it's just something simple like adding onboard storage, because that doesn't take up that much space,
2065240	2077240	and why they couldn't do that in the first place. Or someone was theorizing that they may go the route where they're going to include a camera built in to compete with the DSI,
2077240	2081240	so that you can use the camera support, since it does support the camera.
2081240	2088240	They just never have released a camera over here for the PSP, even though it's built into our firmware.
2088240	2093240	I'm reading some comments from chat room. First, I want to say this about the water piece of LittleBigPlanet.
2093240	2098240	Ionotropic said, whoops, where was it? I just saw it. It was something about the water. There it is.
2098240	2102240	Water levels always suck. Do not want. You know what, though?
2102240	2105240	But think about what the water is going to do in the user-created levels.
2105240	2110240	That's what's most exciting. I mean, because water means free movement anywhere, right?
2110240	2115240	No jumping, whatever. It's free movement. That could be very interesting for some of the user-created things.
2115240	2118240	Yeah. I think. We'll see, though.
2118240	2125240	ToaGak says in our chat room at chat.orensonsradio.com, 4,000? Are they going to remove features again?
2125240	2130240	Even the 3,000 lost a feature, the infrared port. Then the Go lost the UMD, so what's this going to lose?
2130240	2134240	Well, the infrared port, I can understand, because they didn't use it for anything.
2134240	2140240	I mean, other than Homebrew, which enabled use of it, but it didn't really use it for anything.
2140240	2143240	I mean, they were going to possibly use it for a keyboard or something, but it never did.
2143240	2148240	I know what the PSP 4,000 will do. It's going to finally stop piracy for good.
2148240	2152240	No, wait. For real this time, guys. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. For real.
2152240	2156240	We're going to stop piracy and Homebrew on the PSP for good. That's what the 4,000 is all about.
2156240	2163240	That's awesome that you're going to do that, except that there's all these other versions of the PSP out there that people can still pirate on.
2163240	2168240	Why would they buy a new system that's not going to be able to do what they want to do?
2168240	2178240	It'd be the equivalent of them making new currency that has all these counterfeiting preventive measures built into it.
2178240	2180240	But we're going to accept the old currency, too.
2180240	2185240	Then why would you try to counterfeit the new currency? You're just going to counterfeit the old one. It's stupid.
2185240	2187240	I like this comment in our chat room. Joshi16 says,
2187240	2193240	When will the PSP become over 9,000? That's a fair question.
2193240	2194240	Maybe another five years.
2194240	2196240	That's a fair question.
2196240	2198240	All right. Well, moving on to other Sony news.
2198240	2208240	There's a report out there that apparently there's a survey from an online research company that has been sent out that apparently is looking at interest in a premium subscription to PSN.
2208240	2214240	Sony's kind of thinking about if they ask for membership fees, they could do some extra goodies and so forth.
2214240	2225240	For example, hour-long trials for full PS3 titles, access to PS1 classics and cross-game voice chat, which apparently is still not...
2225240	2230240	I always thought that was kind of there in PS3 games, but apparently it is still not there.
2230240	2236240	Let's see. Also something called cloud storage, which is similar to what we have with Steam Cloud,
2236240	2242240	which basically could be an online space where you could store saved data and then you could pull your saved games from this cloud.
2242240	2246240	So this is very good for when you're going over to friends' houses and so forth.
2246240	2256240	The survey also drops hints that they're thinking about things like streaming Netflix without a disk, Hulu support, free access to minis, premium things and so forth.
2256240	2260240	Now, I would not read too much into these types of surveys.
2260240	2261240	Surveys are surveys.
2261240	2267240	They're gauging interest and they're going to throw all sorts of possibilities out there that might not have been thought up by Sony.
2267240	2269240	They might have been thought up by the marketing company.
2269240	2275240	I mean, it's that old corporate mentality of let's throw things against the wall and see what sticks.
2275240	2280240	So, I mean, it's not to say that nothing here is ever going to come true.
2280240	2286240	Someone with power is thinking about it, but I don't think there's need to flail and panic just yet.
2286240	2290240	Loki? Dark Sakura? What do you think? Agree? Disagree?
2290240	2295240	Some of it will probably come true because all the Sony rumors seem to come true sooner or later.
2295240	2297240	They have lasers getting leaked.
2297240	2304240	I think in some ways, if you think about it, Sony is already doing a pay for membership system.
2304240	2307240	Hello? They already have their core magazine.
2307240	2313240	That magazine unlocks special demos such as the Mod Nation Racers Beta.
2313240	2316240	It does all these special things and special access.
2316240	2319240	Don't you think Sony kind of already has it?
2319240	2321240	They're just not calling it what Xbox calls it?
2321240	2322240	Yeah.
2322240	2327240	I mean, that's kind of my thought on it is that all these things they're talking about,
2327240	2330240	things that could possibly get expanded to core.
2330240	2334240	Although, I don't know, when you talk about such core features, no pun intended,
2334240	2339240	like cross-game voice chat, that is a little like, wow, they would really charge for that.
2339240	2343240	I mean, you get that free on the Xbox, don't you at least?
2343240	2348240	I mean, I know you can't play games, but I guess then at the same time,
2348240	2351240	you can play games for free on Sony's network and you can't do that on Xbox.
2351240	2354240	So what might be considered a core feature one system might not be for another.
2354240	2355240	I don't know.
2355240	2364240	But I think a lot of the problems with the Sony system is that they don't have their own network.
2364240	2368240	Well, I mean, they have their own network, but they don't have their dedicated servers basically.
2368240	2372240	It's just all, you know, each company has their own servers for PlayStation games
2372240	2376240	since everything on Xbox Live is basically on the Microsoft servers.
2376240	2382240	Cross chat, cross servers is going to be tough because, you know,
2382240	2384240	it's all these different servers you have to go through.
2384240	2386240	I mean, I don't know.
2386240	2389240	I guess they could do it if they really wanted to.
2389240	2392240	Let's go to the chat room for some other comments on the story.
2392240	2393240	GameGuru in our chat room says,
2393240	2398240	Doesn't Sony realize that their free service is the only advantage PSN has over Xbox Live?
2398240	2401240	DJ Tyrant says, I really enjoy core to be honest.
2401240	2403240	I heart Veronica Belmont.
2403240	2405240	There are a lot of core fans out there.
2405240	2411240	I mean, I personally don't subscribe, but I don't think it's a stupid idea.
2411240	2416240	I think it's actually a pretty decent one for the folks that want to, you know, pay the money to have it.
2416240	2421240	You know, a lot of folks used, I mean, it's just the modern equivalent of buying the magazine
2421240	2423240	that came with the demo discs, and you were paying for those.
2423240	2427240	So, it's kind of the modern equivalent of that, honestly.
2427240	2431240	So, anyhow, if you have other thoughts on that, of course, our mailbag is always open.
2431240	2435240	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, but for now, some more gaming news.
2435240	2436240	Yes, DarkSagra?
2436240	2440240	Yes, we have some news regarding SingStar.
2440240	2441240	My favorite.
2441240	2444240	Well, of course, I gave you ABBA.
2444240	2450240	There's a SingStar viewer application to be released, well, it doesn't have a date yet,
2450240	2457240	but to be coming out for PS3 that has a different social networking.
2457240	2462240	You can do different things with the players.
2462240	2467240	It's actually called SingStar Viewer, like I said, which would be in your games folder.
2467240	2470240	You can browse and purchase songs from the SingStar.
2470240	2476240	You can vote on videos and photos and rate stuff, and it's supposed to be free.
2476240	2482240	And you also should be able to use it even when you do not have the SingStar disc in the system.
2482240	2489240	And again, not a date yet on it, but it says that it should be in the coming weeks.
2489240	2493240	Well, that's kind of neat, but that was also, like, for me, kind of a selling point of SingStar,
2493240	2495240	was that, you know, you had access to this.
2495240	2498240	Because I don't know if you've ever gone on, for those that own SingStar on the PS3,
2498240	2500240	if you've ever gone on there and really, and you can have any of them,
2500240	2503240	Volume 1, Volume 2, ABBA Queen, doesn't matter which one you have,
2503240	2506240	go on to there and look at some of the YouTubes people do.
2506240	2509240	There's actually some pretty funny stuff on there.
2509240	2513240	A lot of times the stuff that's high-rated is, like, people's kids.
2513240	2517240	A lot of, like, you know, four-year-old child prodigies that sing get highly ranked.
2517240	2519240	But, like, there's just some really funny stuff there.
2519240	2523240	Like, the guy who dresses up in the Stormtrooper outfit to dance to I Don't Feel Like Dancing.
2523240	2525240	Like, just dumb stuff.
2525240	2528240	But it's the same type of dumb stuff we watch on YouTube.
2528240	2530240	Yeah.
2530240	2534240	So I guess extra publicity for the game is never a bad thing, right?
2534240	2537240	Everyone gets their five minutes of fame?
2537240	2540240	Yeah, I guess, you know, and it's also kind of one of those things where
2540240	2543240	I think that's where it ultimately might help drive sales,
2543240	2545240	is that people download this and go,
2545240	2548240	oh, this is really funny, but I can do better.
2548240	2550240	My nephew can sing better than this kid,
2550240	2552240	or I got an outfit that outdo's this one,
2552240	2555240	so they're going to go buy the game so they can get it on the SingStar channel.
2555240	2557240	It's interesting.
2557240	2561240	It's certainly a selling point of the game that Lips doesn't have,
2561240	2563240	or Karaoke Revolution doesn't have,
2563240	2565240	or hell, even Rock Band doesn't have this.
2565240	2567240	You can't save your performances from Rock Band.
2567240	2569240	Could you imagine, and, oh, God,
2569240	2572240	maybe this is something they're going to cook up for Rock Band 3.
2572240	2574240	Oh, wow, I think I might be on to something, can't you?
2574240	2577240	Especially in this whole thing that we're getting into,
2577240	2581240	can you imagine if Rock Band 3 had this type of,
2581240	2583240	I think that might be it.
2583240	2584240	I bet that's where they're going to go with this.
2584240	2587240	Some type of share your performance on the internet type thing?
2587240	2588240	Probably.
2588240	2589240	I mean, if they're-
2589240	2590240	SingStar Idol?
2590240	2592240	They're doing it the other way right now, aren't they?
2592240	2597240	Where if you're a band, put your song in Rock Band for the masses to consume.
2597240	2600240	Oh, man, I bet that's what's coming in Rock Band 3.
2600240	2602240	Share your performance with the internet.
2602240	2604240	Watch. Watch.
2606240	2608240	Because right now, SingStar's got the leg up on it,
2608240	2611240	but I wonder, if this thing is successful,
2611240	2614240	only a matter of time before the other music games notice.
2616240	2619240	Loki, if there was a Rock Band 3 with internet connectivity,
2619240	2622240	would you consider uploading some of your epic performances to it?
2622240	2624240	I don't really play it that much, sadly.
2624240	2625240	Really?
2625240	2626240	Yeah.
2626240	2629240	Oh my gosh, I would love to see you doing the Timmy song.
2629240	2631240	Lords of the Underworld.
2631240	2632240	Maybe.
2634240	2635240	Alright.
2636240	2642240	Well, another thing that you can kind of share in would be the new Sodium 1,
2642240	2645240	which is kind of an MMO, I guess, on home.
2645240	2648240	I don't know, I apparently ignored the whole MMO part of it
2648240	2651240	because I actually checked it out a little bit.
2651240	2654240	It's a self-contained social MMO, they're calling it,
2654240	2656240	within PlayStation Home,
2656240	2662240	and you kind of go through this teleporter that's in the central plaza,
2662240	2666240	and you go in there and talk to this AI chick called Vicky,
2666240	2670240	and she gives you different minigames and whatnot that you can play,
2670240	2674240	including some different objective-based metagames,
2674240	2679240	and I also have a full arcade-style game to play as well called the Assault Shooter,
2679240	2682240	which I thought was kind of fun,
2682240	2685240	but I think, as you were saying, it's a little bit like Battlezone, I think,
2685240	2687240	the old Atari game.
2687240	2692240	I feel like I've played a game like it on the PC back when I had a 386,
2692240	2694240	and I don't remember what the game was,
2694240	2698240	but it was one of those things that you would call up on the modem and play.
2698240	2700240	Oh man, I distinctly remember the game.
2700240	2702240	It was very popular, too.
2702240	2704240	There were graphics like Battlezone, but it was this whole type of thing
2704240	2707240	where you were out in the field and you would shoot tanks.
2707240	2710240	I want to say I've played this game before, you know?
2710240	2714240	And then, of course, you get different unlocks for leveling up in the game.
2714240	2716240	Apparently, the Assault Shooter game that's in there,
2716240	2719240	only five levels are available in the game for free,
2719240	2722240	and you have to buy more.
2722240	2727240	I guess more levels and items are unlockable through microtransactions.
2727240	2729240	Yeah, I think I would have played it up to about level five.
2729240	2732240	I played it only through level three before I got tired of doing it
2732240	2736240	because I was working on some other stuff.
2736240	2741240	But if I had to pay for more levels than that, I don't think I'm going to.
2741240	2745240	But to me, though, this game didn't seem any different
2745240	2747240	than the other ones already available in the home,
2747240	2751240	and I just miss the whole MMO part of it
2751240	2754240	and how this is even really that innovative.
2754240	2756240	Well, I don't know if I would call it an MMO
2756240	2759240	because at least the shooting part of it, that's not multiplayer.
2759240	2760240	No.
2760240	2764240	Now, the drink-making game, that was kind of multiplayer.
2764240	2767240	If you play as the bartender, someone else is calling the drinks,
2767240	2770240	and if you're ordering the drinks, someone else has to play the bartender.
2770240	2773240	There's, I guess, that, but that's a bit of a stretch.
2773240	2775240	I don't know if I'd call it an MMO.
2775240	2777240	But what I thought was interesting about this
2777240	2780240	is the way it kind of fit into the context of home.
2780240	2782240	And it kind of showed off these features of home
2782240	2784240	that I didn't realize were there,
2784240	2787240	such as the ability to interact with what's on the web.
2787240	2790240	If you go to the website, sodium1.com, I think it is,
2790240	2792240	and you actually put in your PlayStation ID and all this stuff,
2792240	2794240	it tracks your mini achievements.
2794240	2796240	I mean, they're not actual trophies,
2796240	2798240	but they're like achievements within sodium.
2798240	2799240	It tracks them on the website.
2799240	2801240	It tracks your high scores.
2801240	2803240	There's a Facebook app that you can use,
2803240	2804240	and, of course, it's just going to...
2804240	2807240	I enabled it, but I didn't enable it to publish it on my wall
2807240	2809240	because I knew every time I did something in the game,
2809240	2810240	all my friends would have to see it,
2810240	2813240	and I didn't want to burden people with that.
2813240	2815240	But, you know, it does have that connectivity.
2815240	2817240	I thought it was interesting that there's a giant screen
2817240	2820240	within the sodium stadium, or whatever they call it,
2820240	2822240	that has their Twitter feed on it.
2822240	2824240	I don't recall seeing that in home before.
2824240	2826240	Yeah, that'd be nice to have in my clubhouse, too.
2826240	2827240	Right?
2827240	2833240	If that's doable, can I have that in the OLR clubhouse, please?
2833240	2835240	I also thought it was interesting that you could,
2835240	2838240	you know, the points that you earn in the game
2838240	2841240	could go towards unlocking stuff in the home
2841240	2844240	that you could put, like, if you go to the OLR clubhouse now,
2844240	2846240	there's a new table, there's some new seats,
2846240	2847240	and a new little statue.
2847240	2849240	I got all that in the sodium one thing.
2849240	2851240	So, you know, I'm not saying that's really new,
2851240	2853240	because certainly there's a lot of other, you know,
2853240	2855240	areas within home that have done that,
2855240	2858240	but to see that kind of actually integrated with a game
2858240	2859240	was kind of neat.
2859240	2862240	And not just a game like how Namco Museum Essentials
2862240	2864240	was a game that would unlock stuff in home,
2864240	2867240	but the game was actually in home,
2867240	2869240	and that that all worked together very seamlessly.
2869240	2872240	It kind of made me go, huh,
2872240	2876240	this really feels like what home was advertised as
2876240	2878240	a year and a half ago.
2878240	2882240	Games and social interaction working seamlessly together.
2882240	2885240	It's just a bummer that I feel like the game I'm playing here
2885240	2889240	I played back in 1996 on a modem on my PC,
2889240	2891240	but, okay, it's a step forward.
2891240	2893240	You know what I mean?
2893240	2896240	They were, it was a neat game, but it's just like,
2896240	2897240	I don't know.
2897240	2899240	And to be fair, maybe I didn't see enough
2899240	2901240	in the first few levels that you're able to play.
2901240	2903240	I was just talking about it, just like it's like this
2903240	2906240	really revolutionary thing, and I just didn't see it.
2906240	2908240	I was like, oh great, it's another space in home.
2908240	2910240	Awesome.
2910240	2913240	Well, because I think for home, it is doing something new.
2913240	2916240	For the concept of home, I mean,
2916240	2919240	we still don't have our trophy room with our trophies in it,
2919240	2921240	so what else do we have to look forward to in home?
2921240	2924240	Oh, the game integration and the way that it's going to
2924240	2926240	integrate with the rest of the PlayStation brand.
2926240	2929240	So I see this as a step forward.
2929240	2932240	It's not a big step forward, but it was neat.
2932240	2934240	I was entertained for an hour.
2934240	2935240	For free.
2935240	2938240	I did get the walk around still as my creepy Santa Claus,
2938240	2941240	which this time of year is very relevant.
2941240	2944240	You know, dressed like a Santa Claus.
2944240	2946240	One of the dollies just passed out from excitement,
2946240	2948240	apparently, over the snooze.
2948240	2950240	Ooh, crazy.
2950240	2952240	I just don't have a very stable place to put her.
2952240	2954240	Sorry.
2954240	2957240	But anyhow, I don't know.
2957240	2960240	I'm curious to see where this leads in 2010.
2960240	2961240	I don't know.
2961240	2963240	Some folks in chat are asking about the OLR Clubhouse.
2963240	2965240	Yes, on Sony Home, we have an OLR Clubhouse.
2965240	2967240	It might be full.
2967240	2969240	I think we have 25 members in it now.
2969240	2970240	I haven't been joined yet, and it's full already.
2970240	2971240	Is it?
2971240	2972240	Have you tried?
2972240	2973240	I don't know.
2973240	2977240	Try to send a request to the Orange Lounge Radio.
2977240	2979240	It's in there if you search for it.
2979240	2982240	Honestly, I think you type OLRME is like the keyword,
2982240	2984240	O-L-R-M-Y, and it'll come up.
2984240	2986240	And you should be able to join it.
2986240	2988240	And they're saying in chat, make another if it's full.
2988240	2991240	Dude, I already had to pay for the first one.
2991240	2993240	And here's my deal.
2993240	2995240	I will gladly build five clubhouses
2995240	2998240	if they give me something to do in this clubhouse
2998240	3000240	that's really unique.
3000240	3001240	You know what I mean?
3001240	3003240	Let me do the Twitter feed on the TV.
3003240	3005240	Let me put a custom video.
3005240	3008240	Let me put down a radio that will play MP3s from this program.
3008240	3010240	You know, that'll play the rant from earlier tonight
3010240	3011240	or something.
3011240	3013240	You know, let me do something with home
3013240	3015240	other than just have a space to chat in
3015240	3018240	because that's what the rest of home is, you know?
3018240	3020240	Exactly.
3020240	3022240	Deathwishing is saying request.
3022240	3025240	So I thought I approved all the pending requests.
3025240	3029240	So I will go in tonight and make sure it's all approved.
3029240	3031240	But if it's full, I don't know what to tell you.
3031240	3032240	You might be screwed.
3032240	3033240	I'm sorry.
3033240	3035240	But at least you'll have this to look forward to.
3035240	3037240	Something on PBS.
3037240	3040240	That's right, PBS, the Public Broadcast System.
3040240	3042240	Most popularly known maybe for the Lawrence Welk show.
3042240	3043240	I don't know.
3043240	3044240	Reading Rainbow, Rob.
3044240	3045240	Of course.
3045240	3046240	Sesame Street.
3046240	3047240	Doctor Who.
3047240	3048240	That's right.
3048240	3049240	Early Doctor Who.
3049240	3050240	And a lot of great British imports.
3050240	3051240	Obviously, okay.
3051240	3052240	The Red Dwarf.
3052240	3053240	The Public Broadcasting System.
3053240	3055240	All kidding aside, you know the types of stuff
3055240	3056240	they show on here.
3056240	3057240	Masterpiece Theater.
3057240	3060240	And a lot of times, a lot of orchestral concerts
3060240	3062240	and a lot of like, you know, things you would see
3062240	3064240	at like an opera house and so forth.
3064240	3066240	So it might surprise you to know that PBS
3066240	3071240	is planning to record and air video games live in 2010.
3071240	3072240	That's right.
3072240	3075240	The thing that was kind of meant to bridge that gap
3075240	3078240	between the video game community and A Night at the Opera,
3078240	3081240	although, you know, in talking to Tommy Tallarico,
3081240	3083240	the brains behind this before,
3083240	3085240	I don't think he wants people to think video game live
3085240	3087240	is A Night at the Opera because it's not.
3087240	3091240	But it definitely kind of, it's an interesting evolution
3091240	3095240	of that, I suppose you could say, for a new generation.
3095240	3098240	They're actually going to do this live performance
3098240	3101240	on February 5th in New Orleans at the Lakefront Arena
3101240	3103240	and on February 5th of 2010, they're gonna tape this.
3103240	3106240	You can get tickets now through Ticketmaster.
3106240	3110240	And it's actually going to air sometime in June.
3110240	3112240	And apparently also a DVD and Blu-ray
3112240	3114240	because PBS puts out a lot of their programming
3114240	3118240	on DVD, Blu-ray to kind of raise money for the stations
3118240	3120240	because, you know, they're all publicly funded and so forth.
3120240	3123240	So, you know, sales from those will go to help fund PBS.
3123240	3125240	So that's kind of cool for those that were looking to,
3125240	3127240	you know, especially if you live in a place
3127240	3130240	that doesn't get video games live coming there,
3130240	3132240	although they've gone to a lot of places,
3132240	3134240	you'll have an opportunity to see the show.
3134240	3136240	So that's pretty cool.
3136240	3138240	If you're going to dress, though, dress to impress
3138240	3139240	because you might be on TV.
3139240	3141240	Just something to think about.
3141240	3143240	Yeah, Tiger Conchat says, that would be cool.
3143240	3144240	I get PBS and HD.
3144240	3146240	That's true, you know, considering we're talking Blu-ray
3146240	3149240	and PBS, PBS was like the first channel
3149240	3151240	I remember seeing going HD.
3151240	3154240	I think PBS was in HD long before NBC
3154240	3155240	and the other folks got on board.
3155240	3157240	So it's going to look good.
3157240	3158240	It's going to look good.
3158240	3160240	You'll get to see all of Tommy's outfit changes
3160240	3161240	in high definition.
3161240	3164240	It'll be quite impressive.
3164240	3165240	But if that doesn't interest you,
3165240	3167240	maybe Dark Sakura has something that will.
3167240	3172240	Well, you know, we covered the Alien vs. Predator
3172240	3174240	not being approved in Australia
3174240	3178240	and Sega actually appealed it and won.
3178240	3180240	So it looks like Alien vs. Predator
3180240	3182240	is going to be released in Australia
3182240	3184240	with an MA15 Plus title,
3184240	3187240	which is pretty much the goal they had anyway
3187240	3190240	because from this quote it says,
3190240	3191240	It is for adults.
3191240	3192240	It is bloody and frightening.
3192240	3194240	That was our intent.
3194240	3200240	So basically they're saying that they're going to leave it
3200240	3204240	to the reasonable expectations of adults to,
3204240	3206240	you know, whether or not they want to get the game or not.
3206240	3209240	I seem to remember talking about this in a previous episode
3209240	3211240	and the fact that the makers behind that game
3211240	3215240	are very cold and unwilling to budge on this
3215240	3218240	is that we made this game and we are not changing it
3218240	3220240	and if you are not a responsible enough adult to play it,
3220240	3221240	then don't play it.
3221240	3225240	But we're not changing it because you can't handle it.
3225240	3228240	I have to admire it.
3228240	3230240	They might go down in flames,
3230240	3233240	but I have to admire them not wanting to budge.
3233240	3235240	Stick to them guns and maintain some integrity.
3235240	3236240	Gold star for all of you kids.
3236240	3238240	No selling out.
3238240	3241240	Do you think other places have sold out, Rob?
3241240	3243240	Like other game companies?
3243240	3245240	Yeah.
3245240	3248240	One could claim that Valve and so forth sold out
3248240	3250240	when they made those changes to get the game released
3250240	3252240	in Australia and so forth.
3252240	3256240	Well, hold on, let me say this and then I'll go on the tangent.
3256240	3260240	I don't know if that was so much selling out as it was
3260240	3263240	they did what they had to do to release the game.
3263240	3266240	People in movies do this all the time.
3266240	3269240	I mean, if you think these guys are bad in the other countries,
3269240	3271240	look at what they do right here in America
3271240	3273240	with the Motion Picture Association.
3273240	3274240	No, no.
3274240	3277240	Heaven forbid you show a vagina or a penis in your movie
3277240	3280240	or you're going to get smacked with an NC-17 rating
3280240	3283240	and no theater house in America is going to show your movie.
3283240	3285240	Life of Brian does not have an NC-17 rating
3285240	3286240	and it's got full frontal.
3286240	3289240	But it's also a lot older, I think,
3289240	3291240	when movies were fitting into the X category
3291240	3293240	or it might have still been R.
3293240	3294240	I don't think that it was R.
3294240	3297240	For some reason in the 70s, like Porky's and a lot of these movies
3297240	3299240	somehow got under the radar.
3299240	3301240	But you know, in this day and age, let's face it,
3301240	3304240	a movie like Showgirls got a rating like NC-17
3304240	3308240	not because it was bad but because it had a lot of tits and ass.
3308240	3312240	But heaven forbid they show tits and ass in a movie
3312240	3316240	but it's okay to show, you know, torture porn.
3316240	3320240	Movies like Hostel and Saw and all these movies are A-okay.
3320240	3323240	They play them at the multiplexes across America.
3323240	3327240	I mean, it's the same thing.
3327240	3331240	So if you think this type of sensor and directors and so forth
3331240	3334240	change their movies all the time to get down to the R rating
3334240	3337240	because they know if they release it with an NC-17 rating,
3337240	3339240	they're screwed. They'll never make the money back on the movie.
3339240	3341240	The studios force them to do it.
3341240	3344240	They are contractually obliged to deliver a certain rating.
3344240	3346240	Once in a while you get those indie studios.
3346240	3348240	They're like, if you are releasing our unrated movie,
3348240	3350240	you know, once in a while you see those slip through the cracks
3350240	3352240	but unfortunately they don't make money.
3352240	3355240	Or you get the unrated version for a home release.
3355240	3357240	Yeah.
3357240	3360240	And some folks in chat are saying X movie has Full Frontal
3360240	3362240	and Y movie has Full Frontal.
3362240	3364240	Okay, yeah. Okay, fine.
3364240	3366240	You know, you can show a little peen and a little vag and get away with it
3366240	3369240	but, you know, usually you have to appeal it to get the rating
3369240	3373240	and let's face it, you and I, you the listener and I,
3373240	3378240	the hosts can agree that the standards between violence and nudity
3378240	3380240	are way different. Come on.
3380240	3383240	You can't show penetration in a movie
3383240	3385240	but you can show a bullet going through someone's brain.
3385240	3388240	You can show that penetration.
3388240	3391240	Just saying.
3391240	3394240	What if you fired a penis instead of a bullet
3394240	3397240	and it penetrated instead of their head, a vagina?
3397240	3399240	Would that still count if it's fired from a gun?
3399240	3402240	NC-17. A cum shot is always going to get you NC-17.
3402240	3404240	Always.
3404240	3406240	No way are they ever going to let that slide in an unrated movie
3406240	3408240	and I would cite two movies.
3408240	3410240	Happiness, which was released unreleased.
3410240	3412240	It's actually a really good movie.
3412240	3414240	It's by the guy who did Welcome to the Dollhouse.
3414240	3416240	It's pretty good.
3416240	3418240	That came out about 10, 12 years ago
3418240	3420240	and it got an NC-17 rating because
3420240	3422240	you don't actually see the cum shot.
3422240	3424240	You just see the cum hit in the wall
3424240	3426240	but because that's so hideously disgusting, you know,
3426240	3430240	and immoral, it got an NC-17 rating.
3430240	3433240	And then there was a movie that came out a couple years ago, Shortbus,
3433240	3436240	that was just full-on explicit sex in the movie.
3436240	3438240	It was great.
3438240	3440240	But the cool thing, it was by the guy who did Headwig and the Angry Inch.
3440240	3443240	And the interesting thing about it is that he set out to make a movie.
3443240	3446240	His goal was to make a movie with porn in it
3446240	3448240	that was not about the sex.
3448240	3451240	And I have to say, he made a pretty damn good movie.
3451240	3453240	I wouldn't say you should see it if you're under 17,
3453240	3456240	but if you are of age, I think it's a fine movie.
3456240	3458240	I really liked that movie.
3458240	3460240	I thought it was a great movie too.
3460240	3464240	I liked The Lady and it was in Hedwig.
3464240	3466240	SalaciousPopInChat brings up a good point.
3466240	3469240	They did that in Scary Movie 2, Dick in the Head.
3469240	3471240	I forgot about that.
3471240	3473240	That is true. You didn't see Balls though.
3473240	3475240	Maybe it's not penis people have a problem with.
3475240	3477240	It's balls.
3477240	3478240	It's just like breasts.
3478240	3481240	You know, the breast is okay, but the nipple, oh my god, no.
3481240	3483240	Alright.
3483240	3486240	Anyhow, let's move around the country and cover some release dates.
3486240	3488240	Things that are okay.
3488240	3491240	Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot a tangent.
3491240	3494240	And one of our folks that works for Orange Andrea
3494240	3496240	would want me to say something about this on air.
3496240	3498240	Dekeman, because he posted this to the Twitter earlier this week.
3498240	3500240	Did you hear about the Australian censorship
3500240	3502240	and the fact that they are looking at,
3502240	3504240	and I don't know if this is somebody running with us,
3504240	3508240	they are looking at installing basically China-like restrictions on their internet
3508240	3511240	and filtering out objectionable sites.
3511240	3513240	Quote,
3513240	3516240	This is really going to hurt your tough man edge, Australia.
3516240	3519240	I mean, seriously, it was all about crocodile hunters
3519240	3521240	and beer drinking and kangaroos over there.
3521240	3523240	That's not an internet.
3523240	3526240	And, and, don't forget the transvestites.
3526240	3531240	But now it's just like, you know, censored internet.
3531240	3534240	I hope that just got misconstrued.
3534240	3535240	I really hope.
3535240	3537240	And Dekeman posted it to our Twitter.
3537240	3539240	It was a little disheartening.
3539240	3542240	I think that any type of censorship is, you know,
3542240	3545240	the only people who I think should be allowed to censor
3545240	3549240	are parents and people censoring themselves.
3549240	3553240	But if I'm not mistaking, Australia has a parliament-style government,
3553240	3555240	which means they do have elected officials.
3555240	3558240	So, Australians, if you're listening and you disagree with this,
3558240	3562240	vote your politicians the fuck out of office immediately.
3562240	3565240	Unless, of course, they were the politicians that were against this.
3565240	3567240	But I believe in your country.
3567240	3571240	You do vote, and you vote these people the fuck out
3571240	3573240	that are trying to do this.
3573240	3576240	Anyhow, let's move on to happier topics.
3576240	3578240	A lot of angst tonight.
3578240	3581240	I swear, I'm actually in a really good mood, all things considered.
3581240	3584240	Life is pretty good right now.
3584240	3585240	I can't complain.
3585240	3588240	So I don't know why we're having such an angsty show tonight.
3588240	3592240	OLR, quit trying to bring me down.
3592240	3594240	Alright, not much coming up this week in the US.
3594240	3596240	Mainly three games.
3596240	3599240	Guitar Hero Van Halen coming out on PlayStation 2.
3599240	3601240	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
3601240	3605240	That is, of course, if you didn't get it free with Guitar Hero 5
3605240	3609240	during the month of September.
3609240	3612240	Twin Sector being released on PC.
3612240	3616240	And finally, on the Wii, we have Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles,
3616240	3619240	The Crystal Bears, coming out on the Wii.
3619240	3624240	The first real good Wii Final Fantasy game.
3624240	3628240	That's the one that they've been advertising ever since the damn thing launched, right?
3628240	3631240	Yep, that would be the one.
3631240	3635240	Well, moving over to Japan, honestly, it's pretty dried up over there, too.
3635240	3637240	I mean, you've got your Final Fantasy XIII now,
3637240	3641240	which I have seen trophies popping up on my Facebook friend feed,
3641240	3645240	so I know I have friends that imported this stuff, and they're playing away on it.
3645240	3646240	Not one of them.
3646240	3648240	So now things are dying down a little bit there,
3648240	3650240	but that's not to say there's nothing coming out.
3650240	3653240	I mean, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360 is getting a price reduction this week in Japan,
3653240	3660240	as well as Infernal, Hell's Vengeance is a new game coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.
3660240	3664240	On the PlayStation 3, it sounds like a new Hori arcade stick is coming out,
3664240	3665240	but that is really it.
3665240	3668240	There's no new releases on the particular system,
3668240	3670240	which, considering the games usually come out Friday over there,
3670240	3675240	and Friday is Christmas Eve, not going to really see a whole lot, probably.
3675240	3677240	Nintendo Wii, same story.
3677240	3680240	Going over to the PlayStation 2,
3680240	3684240	there is a Neo Geo Online Collection Complete Box, Volumes 1 and 2.
3684240	3686240	That is something new coming out over there,
3686240	3689240	but really that's just rehashed old stuff.
3689240	3695240	And on the Nintendo DS, Zelda no Densetsu Taoyu no Kiteki.
3695240	3697240	Anyone want to guess what that is on the Nintendo DS?
3697240	3698240	I would say The Train Game.
3698240	3699240	It is The Train Game.
3699240	3701240	Gets its release this week in Japan,
3701240	3703240	so that is probably the big release in Japan this week.
3703240	3705240	Quickly looking on the PSP,
3705240	3708240	there are actually a few things you might care about on the PSP.
3708240	3710240	Assassin's Creed Bloodlines in Japan this week,
3710240	3713240	Lucky Star Net Idle Meister,
3713240	3716240	and Metal Slug XX all make its way to the PSP.
3716240	3717240	So, funny enough,
3717240	3719240	the system that seems to be having the biggest week is the PSP.
3719240	3720240	Go, Fig.
3721240	3722240	There you go.
3722240	3723240	Some stupid candle won't light.
3723240	3724240	Oops, and I got my days mixed up.
3724240	3726240	Tiger Class says Thursday is Christmas Eve,
3726240	3729240	actually Friday is Christmas Day, so, sorry.
3729240	3731240	Eh, who keeps up with Christmas anymore?
3731240	3735240	The releases are getting all messed up because of the holidays, anyway.
3735240	3738240	So.
3738240	3741240	Well, it's pretty much dry in the UK.
3741240	3743240	Just one game on the 22nd.
3743240	3745240	Well, one game came out today,
3745240	3746240	Nicky Rock and Ball.
3746240	3748240	Well, I should say Yesterday now for them,
3748240	3751240	because it's the 20th already.
3751240	3755240	On the 22nd is Savage Moon The Hera Campaign on PSP.
3755240	3758240	That's about it.
3758240	3760240	Couple more news stories for you guys,
3760240	3762240	and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week
3762240	3764240	here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3764240	3766240	It looks like it's going to be a good one tonight.
3766240	3768240	I peeked at what DarkSakura picked,
3768240	3772240	and it's one that I wholeheartedly endorse.
3772240	3775240	Speaking about Final Fantasy XIII,
3775240	3777240	it did pretty well this week,
3777240	3782240	including 1 million copies sold within,
3782240	3785240	I believe, the first 24 hours, yes.
3785240	3786240	Wow.
3786240	3787240	Over 2 million copies sold.
3787240	3788240	I know they shipped 2 million,
3788240	3792240	so probably between 1 and 2 million copies sold.
3792240	3797240	Of course, that includes the Lightning Edition PS3
3797240	3804240	with the silkscreen pink, I guess, portrait of lightning.
3804240	3808240	Yeah, we still have to wait a few months.
3808240	3812240	So it's basically the equivalent of a Modern Warfare 2 here,
3812240	3813240	which sold what?
3813240	3815240	Didn't they say it sold like 7 million in the first week,
3815240	3817240	or some huge amount?
3817240	3820240	A Halo 3 sold millions.
3820240	3822240	This is kind of the equivalent over there.
3822240	3823240	Heck yeah.
3823240	3826240	Which surprises probably no one.
3826240	3829240	But the real question is,
3829240	3832240	what will happen when the game comes out here?
3832240	3834240	Will it move a million in one night here?
3834240	3836240	I don't think it will.
3836240	3838240	It'll move a million overall,
3838240	3840240	but it won't move a million in the first night.
3840240	3841240	Oh yeah, it will.
3841240	3842240	No way.
3842240	3844240	I hope I'm wrong.
3844240	3846240	We'll see.
3846240	3848240	Anyhow, one other thing.
3848240	3851240	And this is something actually new that directly affects me,
3851240	3853240	because I participated in it this week.
3853240	3857240	Squeenix is now accepting beta applications for Final Fantasy XIV.
3857240	3859240	So if you're skipping Final Fantasy XIII,
3859240	3861240	maybe you are looking forward to Final Fantasy XIV.
3861240	3862240	That's right.
3862240	3865240	The applications are now open for the Final Fantasy XIV beta.
3865240	3867240	Please note, this is only the Windows edition.
3867240	3868240	They're not doing, it looks like,
3868240	3871240	what they did on the PlayStation 2 for Final Fantasy XI,
3871240	3873240	where they actually were shipping hard drives to people
3873240	3874240	to beta test that,
3874240	3876240	and they could keep them as a thank you gift.
3876240	3878240	That's not the case here.
3878240	3880240	You will have to sign up for only the Windows version,
3880240	3881240	at least for right now.
3881240	3883240	They are doing the PS3 version as well,
3883240	3886240	but you can sign up for it, but it's not now.
3886240	3888240	Maybe I'll sign up for the beta.
3888240	3890240	You know, might as well.
3890240	3892240	Sign up for it, and then if I don't get in, I'll take yours.
3892240	3894240	How's that?
3894240	3896240	I already had one friend do that for me.
3896240	3898240	I'm trying to find friends to sign up.
3898240	3901240	I'm like, if you get in and I don't, I want it.
3901240	3902240	But anyhow...
3902240	3904240	I just don't know if I'm...
3904240	3908240	Honestly, I hardly have time to play World of Warcraft,
3908240	3910240	and Star Trek Online's coming out.
3910240	3912240	I know, I'm in the same boat, but like, seriously,
3912240	3915240	I will push World of Warcraft to the side for a little while
3915240	3917240	to focus on this, if it's good.
3917240	3919240	If they've learned from their mistakes from XI,
3919240	3921240	which I still think XI was a solid game for its time,
3921240	3923240	it just didn't age well.
3923240	3926240	You know, I think if they really have kind of combined
3926240	3929240	the best parts of that with the best parts of World of Warcraft,
3929240	3931240	this game could be pretty awesome.
3931240	3933240	So I want to check it out.
3933240	3935240	Anyhow, though, just so you know,
3935240	3938240	you need to be 18 years old in order to apply.
3938240	3940240	You have to be fluent in English,
3940240	3942240	which, if you're listening to this show, I'm assuming you are.
3942240	3945240	Or you could be fluent in Japanese, French, or German,
3945240	3947240	because I know we do have some listeners in Japan
3947240	3949240	and even some of those other countries there.
3949240	3952240	And apparently, though, a PS3 one will come out later.
3952240	3955240	It's just that right now you can only sign up for the PC version.
3955240	3958240	Also, no MMORPG experience required,
3958240	3960240	but I will tell you, since I did sign up,
3960240	3963240	I was prepared to fill out a little bit of a questionnaire
3963240	3965240	about your gaming experience,
3965240	3969240	which is translated from a Japanese version, you can kind of tell.
3969240	3972240	But yeah, let us know.
3972240	3975240	If any of you OLR people get in, let me know so I can be jealous,
3975240	3977240	especially if I don't get in.
3977240	3979240	This would use my Play Online ID, right?
3979240	3982240	No, it doesn't. I think they're going away from Play Online.
3982240	3984240	It's a whole new login.
3984240	3987240	I tried my Play Online ID and it didn't work.
3987240	3989240	Anyhow, moving on, and something you don't need Play Online for
3989240	3992240	is to access the Classic Game of the Week.
3992240	3994240	That's right, every week here on the show,
3994240	3998240	DarkSakura takes a walk through gaming's history
3998240	4001240	by stepping into the vault and picking a classic game that she says,
4001240	4003240	You know what, darn it?
4003240	4005240	You guys ought to be playing this game.
4005240	4007240	DarkSakura, what did you pick for the game this week?
4007240	4010240	Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.
4010240	4012240	Great pick. I'll have the music here shortly.
4012240	4014240	Firefox had to reboot, so I'll get the music here in a moment.
4014240	4020240	Fun. Well, the game originally came out in Japan in 1987
4020240	4028240	for the Famicon Disk System, as did the third one, too.
4028240	4034240	It came out in the US in cartridge form in 1988.
4034240	4041240	It's a little bit of a different game than the first one.
4041240	4045240	It has some RPG elements you can go and of course talk to the townsfolk
4045240	4048240	and then have what a horrible night for a curse
4048240	4055240	when you go and jump in on the zombies
4055240	4060240	and things that wander around the countryside when nightfall hits, apparently.
4060240	4067240	You do have to buy items, which you'll need to get to different areas.
4067240	4069240	You have to get hearts.
4069240	4072240	And you can also buy new whips as you keep going on.
4072240	4075240	You have an experience rating system,
4075240	4080240	so your experience rating increases, of course, as you collect hearts.
4080240	4083240	And that's actually something that made it into Dracula X.
4083240	4087240	Not Dracula X, but Symphony of the Night, if you'll remember.
4087240	4090240	And as you can probably hear there a little bit of, I did get the music to come up.
4090240	4094240	So, of course, Castlevania II, who did not love the music in this game?
4094240	4097240	Now we have some of the music playing in the background.
4097240	4099240	That's right.
4099240	4112240	But anyway, I'll listen to it for a little bit.
4112240	4115240	Easily one of the ten best songs ever in a video game. Easily.
4115240	4117240	Yeah.
4117240	4122240	Anyway, the whole point of the game is that you have to go to different mansions
4122240	4126240	to find different parts of Dracula's corpse and then the magic cross.
4126240	4133240	So, you can actually use the different body parts as power-ups, kind of.
4133240	4135240	Like the rib bone is a shield.
4135240	4143240	And then, once you get everything, you can clear the blockade to Dracula's castle and fight.
4143240	4145240	So, yeah.
4145240	4151240	It was directed by Akamatsu, who also did Castlevania III.
4151240	4161240	And it had a password system for the US version as opposed to the save system that the Famicom Disk System had.
4161240	4164240	You know, like, side bike? Hello.
4164240	4173240	There's also some pretty crazy English in the game, like naming Simon Simon, like with two M's.
4173240	4183240	And there's, you know, of course, the music in it was done by Matsubara Kenichi,
4183240	4189240	who did the Castlevania Arcade, the Haunted Castle.
4189240	4196240	And they also used some of that for Simon's Quest.
4196240	4206240	It also has the different parts of the game, you know, the statues and things, crying blood.
4206240	4210240	So, lots of cool stuff going on.
4210240	4216240	Also, it actually, the game caused some controversy in the US with Nintendo Power.
4216240	4222240	It was the second issue of Nintendo Power that had the Simon's Quest cover,
4222240	4226240	and it was also in Howard and Nestor, if you remember Howard and Nestor.
4226240	4232240	But the cover apparently scared children.
4232240	4234240	So, caused a little problem.
4234240	4237240	I got in trouble in grade school over this magazine.
4237240	4239240	And it had nothing to do with the cover, actually.
4239240	4242240	It's just that I brought it to school one day and I was trying to show a friend of mine during class.
4242240	4244240	The teacher was pissed at me.
4244240	4248240	But I was so excited, because it was Castlevania II and it was awesome.
4248240	4250240	Yep.
4250240	4258240	Also, with this particular one, it was actually the first in the series that got away from linear gameplay
4258240	4261240	and inspired, actually, Symphony of the Night.
4261240	4265240	Not necessarily Metroid-inspired, Rob.
4265240	4266240	And...
4266240	4271240	Debatable, but okay.
4271240	4278240	Certainly this game was so different from the first Castlevania that you already kind of started splitting up the series in a way at this point.
4278240	4288240	But, I just have to say real quick, it was very interesting in the 8-bit era how deviant sequels were of the original.
4288240	4292240	Like, you think about Super Mario Bros. 2, way different than the first one.
4292240	4294240	Super Mario Bros. 2 was a different game.
4294240	4300240	I know, I know, but still, our perception of it as kids, you know, not knowing this whole Japanese stuff, was way different here.
4300240	4302240	You know, Castlevania II was really different.
4302240	4304240	Mega Man 2 was kind of different.
4304240	4308240	You know, a lot of sequels in the 8-bit era were really different than the original game.
4308240	4311240	I can't say that Mega Man 2 was at all different.
4311240	4319240	Each of the Mega Man games on the, um, the NES just kept adding different things and changing different, but they all pretty much kept the same formula.
4319240	4323240	Even the X series kept the same formula.
4323240	4333240	I can't really say that those weren't too different, but this, in this case, this one is a fairly big departure from how the first one went.
4333240	4341240	But then what was also particularly weird about this, and Super Mario Bros., I guess you could say, is that they both went kind of back to the formula of the original in the third game.
4341240	4346240	Although, Super Mario debatable, but Castlevania definitely went back to kind of the formula of the first game.
4346240	4351240	Keep in mind, Super Mario 2 in Japan was what we got as, um, the lost levels.
4351240	4352240	Sure, sure.
4352240	4354240	And it was, just like the first one, only harder.
4354240	4355240	Right.
4355240	4357240	And it had the, um, the poison mushrooms and stuff.
4357240	4367240	So, yeah, I think Mario, actually, if you look at it with the actual successors to the original, that one kept the same formula, too.
4367240	4369240	But, um...
4369240	4374240	Okay, I have to say real quick from chat, because this is a really good point, Black Wolf, our good pal Bobby Black Wolf says,
4374240	4377240	The platformer in Retro Game Challenge was different in all three versions.
4377240	4380240	Even in that game, they made the sequel so different.
4380240	4381240	That's kind of like an inside joke.
4381240	4388240	Well, at any rate, um, something that might be interesting to other people, this is from an interview in 2002,
4388240	4393240	is Igarashi Koji, who is, like, one of my video game heroes and who I got a hug from.
4393240	4394240	I'm so happy.
4394240	4407240	Um, actually, uh, was talking about considering a compilation of the NES titles for, um, for, uh, I suppose, um, either Game Boy or PC, so...
4407240	4412240	Well, I seem to recall there was an 8-bit collection that came out that had the...
4412240	4415240	Yeah, there was. This was actually in response to the compilation.
4415240	4416240	Gotcha.
4416240	4418240	So, but anyway, this is a cool game.
4418240	4424240	Very, very good pick tonight. Uh, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, one of my absolute favorite 8-bit games that ever existed.
4424240	4425240	I love this music right here.
4429240	4431240	That's the very first song you hear when you press start.
4433240	4434240	This isn't Bloody Tears.
4434240	4440240	If nothing else, just, like, one of the best music game soundtracks you'll ever hear.
4440240	4443240	You know, I do have to say there is a Castlevania game that has a better soundtrack.
4443240	4444240	Hmm.
4444240	4447240	But in my opinion, it's Dracula X.
4447240	4453240	Not just because it was Redbook Audio, because I actually like the process, the music on the SNES version better in some cases.
4453240	4454240	Mm-hmm.
4454240	4457240	But it did have some fantastic mixes of the songs.
4457240	4465240	So, but I'd have to put this up there, at least as far as the, the SNES titles go. That one's probably got my favorite music in it.
4465240	4473240	Interesting. Our other pal, Bress Lowell in chat, who, uh, of course is a co-host on Understation Live, says, uh, Simon's Quest is actually my least favorite Castlevania game.
4473240	4477240	Now, if you want to see something really funny about Simon's Quest, just look for the Angry Nintendo Nerd.
4477240	4478240	Yeah.
4478240	4482240	His version, his description of it was fantastic.
4482240	4491240	Um, I have to say my least favorite Castlevania game, and I, I know this is one of your favorites, Jamie, but Castlevania V on the SNES was ruined for me.
4491240	4492240	Five?
4492240	4496240	Just, it was, well, right? Because it was, it was supposed to be the port of Dracula.
4496240	4498240	It was, it came out as Dracula X.
4498240	4499240	Didn't they call it Dracula V?
4499240	4500240	No, they called it Dracula X.
4500240	4502240	I thought, I thought in a magazine it was like Castlevania V.
4502240	4503240	I've got the box, it says Dracula X.
4503240	4509240	Alright. But I, I just thought at some point I remember referring to it as Castlevania V, but it, well.
4509240	4511240	Because it did come out after Super Castlevania IV.
4511240	4513240	Right. But it was so...
4513240	4520240	Yeah, no, it was, it was really, I would have to say neutered.
4520240	4523240	It was, it was a castrated version of Dracula X.
4523240	4526240	Rob, you're gonna have to come over some night and just play through Dracula X with me.
4526240	4527240	It'll be fun.
4527240	4531240	On the, um, the NeoGeo. We'll have to put, we'll have to put a feet up.
4531240	4533240	Rob, Rob playing as Maria.
4533240	4535240	La la la, la la la la.
4535240	4537240	One of her attacks is singing.
4537240	4538240	Nice.
4538240	4542240	She sings badly that it kills, like, everything around her, and her little singing is la la la la la la.
4542240	4544240	Like that.
4544240	4549240	Uh, also you're forgetting, uh, I think Bresloul might be neglecting Castlevania Judgment.
4549240	4550240	Huh? What? Who?
4550240	4551240	The fighting game on Wii?
4551240	4553240	What? I, I don't, what?
4553240	4556240	Oh, I see. That doesn't exist in your universe. I see.
4556240	4558240	Maybe Castlevania 64?
4558240	4563240	Oh, snap! That's right! Bresloul! Castlevania 64. I think Loki wins.
4563240	4565240	That was pretty bad.
4565240	4567240	That was definitely a low point in the Castlevania series.
4567240	4570240	Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.
4570240	4575240	We're going to take a quick break, though, and we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so please stay tuned.
4575240	4577240	We will be right back.
4582240	4588240	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, where we are live with our 349th episode of the show.
4588240	4592240	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.
4592240	4600240	www.allgames.com, and thanks to the folks there that help let us take over the stream and do our little show every Sunday night.
4600240	4601240	We really appreciate it.
4601240	4607240	So before we get back into some gaming news tonight, we've had some rants and stuff, and I got angry earlier in the show,
4607240	4610240	but obviously I saved this for later in the show.
4610240	4613240	It turns out I might be wrong. I might have been wrong.
4613240	4618240	And I don't like to admit when I'm wrong, but apparently I was wrong.
4618240	4621240	And it has to do with Avatar, that movie that came out.
4621240	4624240	I was coming out here saying, oh, this movie's probably going to bomb.
4624240	4627240	No one's going to fucking care about Avatar.
4627240	4630240	Well, it was a 70-something million at the box office.
4630240	4632240	I haven't heard a negative thing about it.
4632240	4636240	I've heard that the plot is kind of meh, but that this movie is still amazing.
4636240	4639240	I have seen lots of people on Facebook, on my friends list.
4639240	4644240	I don't really trust critics, but I trust my friends that say, OMG, best movie ever.
4644240	4646240	Or, OMG, what a great movie.
4646240	4649240	So now I'm kind of sitting here going, damn, I might have to go see it.
4649240	4652240	There's just a lot of people saying such great things about it.
4652240	4653240	Loki, did you go?
4653240	4654240	I did. I saw it in 3D.
4654240	4655240	And?
4655240	4656240	It was awesome.
4656240	4657240	Was it really?
4657240	4658240	It was good. It wasn't.
4658240	4663240	If you're looking for an absolutely original plot, you're not going to get it with this.
4663240	4667240	You can see stuff coming before it happens and stuff like that.
4667240	4668240	But it was beautiful.
4668240	4673240	As far as looking at the movie from a CG standpoint,
4673240	4675240	a lot of the stuff was really seamless.
4675240	4682240	The environments and everything completely rendered, so it looks absolutely gorgeous.
4682240	4684240	And the 3D was awesome in it.
4684240	4690240	It wasn't really just no gimmicky stuff where stuff's flying at your face and that kind of stuff.
4690240	4692240	This is even better.
4692240	4695240	I went to the new theaters that opened up in Folsom.
4695240	4701240	This Paladio, I've never heard of this brand, but Cinema West.
4701240	4707240	Other than having a really annoying little pre-show advertisement thing,
4707240	4712240	because they have before the movies and they have this really creepy looking rapist bee.
4712240	4715240	Did you say a rapist bee?
4715240	4718240	Yeah, he looks like he could be a pedophile or a rapist.
4718240	4721240	So they kept playing those advertisements.
4721240	4723240	We hated the bee after about a minute.
4723240	4728240	But they have the greatest innovations in cinema in that theater.
4728240	4734240	Other than the fact that they're advertising that it's the largest solar-powered cinema in the world,
4734240	4736240	and the fact that it's all digital screens,
4736240	4741240	they have gone innovative in an area that I never thought possible.
4741240	4743240	They installed a toilet seat in the seat.
4743240	4745240	No, no, no, no. Even better.
4745240	4746240	Okay.
4746240	4748240	Push a button, get beer.
4748240	4750240	No, no, no, no. Even better.
4750240	4753240	So I bought my popcorn and drink at the concession stand,
4753240	4757240	and I'm eating the popcorn and I'm like, man, this is really kind of dry.
4757240	4759240	There's not a lot of butter on this.
4759240	4760240	You know, what the hell?
4760240	4763240	I'm like, this new theater kind of sucks.
4763240	4764240	Walk over to get my salt.
4764240	4765240	What is there?
4765240	4766240	A butter pump.
4766240	4770240	Yes, you can put as much fucking butter on this popcorn as you want.
4770240	4775240	And not only that, they have the season, you know, the different season popcorn toppings
4775240	4779240	that normally at the UA would charge you to get a little container of it.
4779240	4780240	All free.
4780240	4782240	Unlimited butter on this thing.
4782240	4784240	I was like, oh my god, this is the greatest theater ever.
4784240	4786240	Oh my god, all you can eat butter?
4786240	4789240	Exactly.
4789240	4795240	There's only one thing better than butter, Loki, and that's more butter.
4795240	4797240	It's just the topping.
4797240	4800240	I'm like, I don't know if I should push that button because I think, you know,
4800240	4802240	I would assume that butter is coming out of there,
4802240	4805240	but it could be like chocolate sauce or something like that.
4805240	4808240	Usually it's like liquid magma that is kind of butter flavored.
4808240	4810240	And so I pushed the button and butter popped out.
4810240	4812240	I'm like, awesome.
4812240	4814240	Push a button, get butter.
4814240	4816240	Is that the directions?
4816240	4818240	Like, you know how they have directions on how to wash your hands?
4818240	4820240	Oh, there is no directions. It just said topping.
4820240	4823240	It did not say butter topping. It just said topping.
4823240	4826240	I'm like, well, this could be like anything.
4826240	4829240	Yeah, there's some people in chat saying, this isn't news, Loki.
4829240	4831240	My theater does that.
4831240	4834240	Well, none of ours do, so it's news for me.
4834240	4836240	Now, here's the ultimate question.
4836240	4838240	Was there bacon seasoning?
4838240	4843240	Not that I'm aware of, but, you know, steps, baby steps.
4843240	4845240	I see. I see. It's a step in the right direction.
4845240	4847240	Let's not bite off more than we can chew.
4847240	4850240	And bacon salt's not that good. Trust me.
4850240	4855240	You know, as cool of a concept as bacon salt is, it does not taste like bacon.
4855240	4860240	All right. Anyhow, let's move on with some more topics tonight,
4860240	4862240	some other news stories.
4862240	4864240	I just had to say that about Avatar.
4864240	4866240	You know, I can man up and admit when I was wrong,
4866240	4868240	and I may have been wrong about Avatar.
4868240	4871240	I can't say I was wrong about Avatar because I haven't seen it yet,
4871240	4873240	but I may have been wrong about it.
4873240	4874240	We'll see.
4874240	4877240	It's pretty good. I'd go see it in the theater and in 3D.
4877240	4878240	You have to see it in 3D.
4878240	4880240	I will see it in 3D, I promise.
4880240	4883240	But I also have to see Princess and the Frog,
4883240	4886240	because I did get to meet Princess Tiana this weekend,
4886240	4887240	and she's mighty fierce.
4887240	4889240	And I heard some of the songs from Princess and the Frog
4889240	4891240	in the little street show they do.
4891240	4894240	I really want to see Princess and the Frog.
4894240	4896240	So that's at the top of my list.
4896240	4901240	And then maybe Avatar if my mom doesn't drag me to see Precious on Christmas,
4901240	4903240	which is likely.
4903240	4904240	How about some gaming news?
4904240	4906240	Less movies, more games.
4906240	4907240	Yes.
4907240	4911240	So I guess we've got some rapid-fire news to go into here.
4911240	4912240	Sure.
4912240	4918240	Starting things off, Dead or Live is coming to the PSP,
4918240	4919240	but not what you might think.
4919240	4924240	Dead or Live Paradise, which is Dead or Live beach volleyball,
4924240	4926240	minus the volleyball.
4926240	4930240	So it's just Dead or Live giggling girls in bikinis jumping around
4930240	4935240	watching their boobs move to music, the game.
4935240	4939240	So that's awesome.
4939240	4940240	Thank you, Tecmo.
4940240	4944240	Why don't they just call it Boob Physics, the game?
4944240	4946240	Because that would be offensive.
4946240	4947240	Oh, I'm sorry.
4947240	4952240	But yeah, so it'll be coming out spring 2010, and it's awesome.
4952240	4954240	That's innovation right there.
4954240	4955240	PSP 4000.
4955240	4956240	No.
4956240	4957240	That.
4957240	4962240	Speaking of fake boobs, Playboy has done their annual girls of video games.
4962240	4964240	Their 2010 spread.
4964240	4968240	And this year they'll be featuring women from such games as God of War,
4968240	4972240	Crimecraft, The Saboteur, Dante's Inferno, Mafia 2, and Heavy Rain,
4972240	4978240	including some characters I don't know because I haven't played those games yet.
4978240	4983240	Skylar St. Clair from The Saboteur.
4983240	4988240	Madison Page, I guess the main character from Heavy Rain is new in there as well.
4988240	4992240	So if you want to see some fake naked boobies, I guess,
4992240	4997240	then pick up the January, February issue of Playboy.
4997240	4999240	So now they're skipping months in Playboy.
4999240	5000240	I mean, does it come down to that?
5000240	5001240	Is it bi-monthly now?
5001240	5004240	I don't know.
5004240	5011240	And then finally, I still don't understand the idea of buying Playboy for video game rendered characters,
5011240	5015240	but I suppose either way you buy the magazine, the girls are fake.
5015240	5016240	So, hey, whatever.
5016240	5020240	They have Tara Reid on the cover, but I bet you she's not topless, even though she's a slut.
5020240	5021240	Oh, sorry.
5021240	5026240	Would it be bad if I said, yeah, she is topless because I saw the pictures?
5026240	5027240	Okay, well, awesome.
5027240	5030240	But still, that's not like, I don't know.
5030240	5033240	But I'm saying it's about as real as the video game magazine spread.
5033240	5034240	I'm just saying.
5034240	5035240	I'm just saying.
5035240	5040240	And finally, this Thursday, we're going to be getting some wonderful holiday treats as well.
5040240	5046240	On the 22nd, not only will we be getting the download content for LittleBigPlanet,
5046240	5048240	which is going to be all sorts of awesome,
5048240	5052240	but we'll be getting the Gran Turismo 5 Time Trial Challenge.
5052240	5057240	Of course, if you have a Japanese account, you can download that right now, and it's in English.
5057240	5063240	Puzzlegeddon, which I think came out last week on the...
5063240	5065240	The puzzle to destroy all puzzles.
5065240	5066240	Puzzlegeddon.
5066240	5067240	Puzzlegeddon.
5067240	5070240	Let's see.
5070240	5079240	Also, there will be, of course, Guitar Hero 5 songs, High Speed Soul by Nada Surf,
5079240	5082240	Sister Jack by Spoon, Cut Your Hair by Pavement,
5082240	5088240	and the Indie Rock Track Pack featuring all three of those as well.
5088240	5093240	And then, of course, the download content, which is really the most important thing.
5093240	5098240	The PlayStation 1 classic, though, this week is going to be Final Fantasy VIII, and that's pretty awesome.
5098240	5099240	Woohoo!
5099240	5101240	So, that'll be coming out on the 26th.
5101240	5102240	Wait. Final Fantasy VIII?
5102240	5103240	VIII.
5103240	5104240	Never mind.
5104240	5106240	Hey, it's not Final Fantasy IX.
5106240	5107240	I thought they just skipped ahead to IX.
5107240	5109240	No, no, no. Final Fantasy IX wasn't that...
5109240	5111240	Dude, I thought we ignored that VIII happened.
5111240	5112240	Listen, I liked VIII.
5112240	5113240	I liked VIII.
5113240	5115240	I'm just being dramatic.
5115240	5118240	Except the last disc bored the crap out of me.
5118240	5119240	VIII had a good story.
5119240	5121240	Y'all know how I feel about the battle system.
5121240	5124240	If you don't, I've ranted about it like 50 times in the history of this show.
5124240	5126240	I got so tired of seeing mob bros.
5126240	5130240	Seriously, I was like, they could not have come up with a better name for this stupid, ugly creature.
5130240	5137240	And then, of course, some PSP minis, Hercules, Chariot Racing, and Spot the Differences is the other game.
5137240	5143240	Wait. Hold on. Spot the Differences is...
5143240	5146240	That's the name of the game. Spot the Differences.
5146240	5148240	Do I even need to crack a joke here?
5148240	5150240	I mean, the jokes write themselves.
5150240	5154240	They can have the PSP-2000 and the PSP-Go and it's like, what, one's crap? No?
5154240	5158240	Spot the Differences.
5158240	5163240	That'd be awesome if we could make a game like that and just like completely obvious differences.
5163240	5169240	Like, you know, one's a puppy, one's a Hiddenberg disaster, you know, some ridiculous stuff.
5169240	5172240	That'd be sweet.
5172240	5178240	Puppy's less violent, right? No?
5178240	5183240	One's a picture of Brittany Murphy, one's a picture of Heath... Never mind, I better not go there.
5183240	5185240	She's a chick.
5185240	5189240	She didn't die from a drug overdose. Oh, wait. No, that's not probably it.
5189240	5191240	Moving on.
5191240	5194240	She was a joker.
5194240	5196240	No?
5196240	5198240	I found something else I was looking for.
5198240	5201240	Oh, I thought you found the differences we were talking about.
5201240	5206240	No, I found something for you, Rob, that I wanted you to play during break and you didn't so you have to play it after the show.
5206240	5208240	Fine. I have to, huh?
5208240	5209240	You have to.
5209240	5211240	I have to? Is it your Cage Match pick?
5211240	5213240	You know what, Rob? I will put it in Cage Match.
5213240	5214240	Will you now?
5214240	5217240	Just because. Even though what I put in Cage Match was hilarious, you can make...
5217240	5220240	Okay, make my Cage Match thing the cookie.
5220240	5223240	Alright. Well, fine.
5223240	5224240	Okay.
5224240	5225240	Alright.
5225240	5227240	Actually, no, this is what I put for Cage Match is really damn funny.
5227240	5229240	Cage Match should be a Brittany Murphy song.
5229240	5231240	Death Wishing in Chat says that...
5231240	5233240	Okay, I'm gonna say this right now. Go call Rob.
5233240	5234240	Oh, no.
5234240	5238240	I don't give a shit about Brittany Murphy or whoever the fuck she was.
5238240	5240240	Don't care. I didn't know her.
5240240	5244240	Sucks she's dead. Sucks for her family.
5244240	5246240	I don't care. The end.
5246240	5249240	Does Tara Reid sing any music?
5249240	5251240	I'm gonna put her in there.
5251240	5253240	I don't know. I don't know.
5255240	5257240	Anyhow...
5259240	5262240	It's like just suddenly the Hindenburg disaster...
5262240	5265240	Wait, hold on, hold on. Can you spot the difference?
5265240	5267240	Tonight's program...
5267240	5269240	Hindenburg disaster.
5270240	5272240	Can you spot the difference?
5272240	5277240	Death Wishing might have found it in chat.
5277240	5281240	It said, uh, pro tip, Hindenburg powered by puppies with cute kitten pilots.
5283240	5285240	I want a picture of that.
5285240	5287240	Alright, anyhow.
5287240	5289240	Moving on.
5289240	5291240	Can we get in some more, um...
5291240	5293240	Last minute star. Not last minute star.
5293240	5295240	See, I want the show to be over.
5295240	5297240	Oh, Rob.
5297240	5299240	Rapid fire topics.
5299240	5301240	Hey, there's a game called Zero Day Attack in Earth.
5301240	5304240	Coming to Xbox Live Marketplace on December 23rd.
5304240	5307240	That's right, Martians invade the Earth, shoot them up, bang bang, blow up.
5307240	5310240	Not the type of game that Square Enix is usually known for.
5310240	5312240	But, here's the kicker about the game.
5312240	5315240	It uses satellite photography.
5315240	5320240	So if you want to blow up real things, have a blast.
5320240	5326240	Just don't blow up certain historical objects that aren't funny.
5326240	5328240	You know what I mean?
5328240	5332240	Although, I do notice in this picture, I just happen to see the Eiffel Tower.
5332240	5334240	And guns going pew pew pew.
5334240	5337240	But I guess because it's Martians, it's okay.
5337240	5339240	It's just a science fiction thing.
5339240	5341240	But I'm just saying.
5341240	5343240	This might be...
5343240	5346240	I can just see horrific YouTubes coming of this game.
5346240	5348240	That's all I'm saying.
5348240	5350240	Horrific YouTubes even worse than the joke I told earlier.
5350240	5352240	Uh, anyhow.
5352240	5356240	And if you were offended by my earlier joke, I have to say to you,
5356240	5358240	Excuse me, internet!
5358240	5360240	That's right, that old catchphrase,
5360240	5363240	Excuse me, princess coin from the Legend of Zelda cartoons,
5363240	5367240	which used to run as the Friday special on the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.
5367240	5372240	And if you're kind of younger, you probably don't remember this,
5372240	5374240	unless you've kind of seen it in a nostalgia post or whatever.
5374240	5376240	But I certainly remember this from when I was younger.
5376240	5378240	I bet a lot of our listeners remember this.
5378240	5380240	Because I think I was around like 10.
5380240	5382240	So a lot of our listeners, you know, 5, 6, probably, or 10.
5382240	5385240	Yeah, they would have the Zelda cartoon on Fridays.
5385240	5388240	Because the rest of the week was Mario cartoons, but Friday was Zelda cartoons.
5388240	5391240	Well, those came out on DVD a while back, and if you bought those,
5391240	5394240	well, it sucks to be you because they're all free on Hulu now.
5394240	5397240	So if you want to see these cartoons and what they're all about,
5397240	5400240	if you just want to see the LOLs that is this,
5400240	5405240	although I will say this, this was definitely a step above the Philips CDI cutscenes.
5405240	5408240	Those were just... wow.
5408240	5410240	It's like I drew in paint.
5410240	5411240	I know.
5411240	5412240	Those were wow.
5412240	5418240	Those are not available on Hulu, but the Zelda stuff is now on Hulu,
5418240	5421240	if you want to relive your youth or have another youth.
5421240	5422240	I don't know.
5422240	5428240	Anyhow, also in tonight's rapid-fire news,
5428240	5435240	apparently Tex Murphy is a guy who is in this series of vintage adventure games.
5435240	5438240	So if you remember those old-school games like, I don't know,
5438240	5441240	I don't want to say like Loom, but I'm thinking of the stuff like Deja Vu,
5441240	5443240	maybe Shadow Gate type of stuff, I don't know, on the PC,
5443240	5445240	King's Quest, throw in a little of that.
5445240	5448240	If those sound fun to you, you can get new games in the series,
5448240	5451240	Mean Streets and Martian Memorandum.
5451240	5453240	They're kind of throwback games to that era,
5453240	5457240	but I notice they mix in photography and a little bit of new stuff.
5457240	5462240	You can all get these free. GOG.com is the place to get these games.
5462240	5464240	Good ol' games.
5464240	5467240	It's a holiday gift from right now until December 24th.
5467240	5468240	Completely off topic, Rob.
5468240	5470240	I thought you said fartography.
5470240	5471240	That would be something completely different.
5471240	5473240	The way that you said it, I thought you said fartography.
5473240	5475240	I can't speak tonight. I don't know what it is.
5475240	5476240	I've botched so many words on the night show.
5476240	5478240	Rob can speak good.
5478240	5480240	I might need to see a doctor.
5480240	5481240	All right, anyhow.
5481240	5483240	Thark Sockra, do you have some rapid-fire news for us?
5483240	5486240	I guess I do, Rob.
5486240	5489240	Well, don't make me twist your arm or nothing.
5489240	5492240	You didn't bring us cupcakes, by the way.
5492240	5495240	Well, boo-hoo, I'm sorry.
5495240	5499240	At any rate, how about some more stuff for the iPhone?
5499240	5506240	There is Need for Speed Shift coming out for iPhone for $9.99.
5506240	5512240	20 cars, 18 tracks, tilt functionality, which means lack of functionality.
5512240	5515240	And you can play over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
5515240	5517240	That's pretty cool.
5517240	5522240	Although I'm kind of a little uncomfortable to imagine what it might look like.
5522240	5525240	But hey, it could come out really good.
5525240	5531240	Also, in other iPhone and racing game-related news, we have a new Ridge Racer.
5531240	5539240	We have Ridge Racer Accelerated, which will be on iPhone for $2.99.
5539240	5545240	So I totally actually really dug the last Ridge Racer that came out on iPhone,
5545240	5548240	even though I didn't play it too long because I did get a little pissed off.
5548240	5551240	So give it a go. Let us know what you think.
5551240	5558240	Also, one other thing, and this has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with Rock Band,
5558240	5561240	because it's about Rock Band.
5561240	5569240	The holiday lineup for Rock Band Weekly is going to be Weezer.
5569240	5575240	We also have Songs from Limp Bizkit, the Offspring and Yellow card.
5575240	5581240	And don't forget, Rock Band Unplugged download content is on hiatus.
5581240	5585240	So here's what we're looking at for the Weezer pack.
5585240	5591240	We have Beverly Hills, Let It All Hang Out, and If You're Wondering If I Want You To, I Want You To.
5591240	5596240	And then Limp Bizkit, Build A Bridge, The Offspring, A Lot Like Me, and Yellow Card Ocean Avenue.
5596240	5599240	The latter three will be 160 points.
5599240	5604240	The pack for Weezer is 440, or 160 for each, again.
5604240	5609240	And they are also available for Lego Rock Band.
5609240	5610240	The end!
5610240	5617240	I was going to say that Riddhiers is pretty awesome to be coming to the iPhone, but it's no daytona.
5617240	5622240	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo!
5622240	5625240	Moving right along into other topics tonight.
5625240	5631240	Hey, how about some Twitter topics?
5631240	5637240	Every week we request your ideas and suggestions for topics over Twitter.
5637240	5638240	And we like to read some of those right now.
5638240	5640240	First, I gotta make sure, because I wasn't here earlier tonight,
5640240	5643240	I gotta make sure some of these things don't duplicate things we're about to talk about later in the show,
5643240	5645240	because that would be a little bit embarrassing.
5645240	5652240	But TigerCaw305 sent us this article about gamers attempt to catch every Pokemon in 72 hours for charity.
5652240	5656240	That's right, some very bored gamers have, no, it's for charity, you can't say that.
5656240	5660240	But some gamers have decided to catch every Pokemon in existence.
5660240	5662240	493 of them, to be exact.
5662240	5664240	In 72 hours!
5664240	5665240	It's all for charity.
5665240	5670240	It's actually not for child's play, as a lot of these recent marathons have been for, which is obviously a great charity.
5670240	5672240	This is for a different one, it's called Allie's House.
5672240	5677240	It's an Oklahoma-based children's cancer foundation that provides support for families with medical expenses,
5677240	5680240	short-term housing, and other types of needs.
5680240	5682240	You can donate to the website.
5682240	5684240	The SpeedyGamers are the guys that are doing this.
5684240	5689240	I want a charity that involves killing Sims.
5689240	5692240	There might be an idea for a marathon there.
5692240	5696240	Put up a proposal, Loki, and bring it to the show, we might do this.
5696240	5703240	TigerCaw also sent us a quick link to an article that Blizzard will definitely work on a console game at some point.
5703240	5708240	So, in other words, not Starcraft Ghost, but like, for real this time, some type of console game.
5708240	5711240	Well, really, I think the title of this says it all.
5711240	5716240	You know, they've done so many great PC games, maybe it's about time for them to do a console game.
5716240	5720240	And they just wanted to clarify, I don't see the PC market as being bad.
5720240	5722240	We didn't have 12 million players 10 years ago.
5722240	5726240	Whatever the format, console or PC, I think if there's a good game, it's going to be played.
5726240	5729240	We're working on PC because it's familiar to us.
5729240	5733240	Console, we have to worry about those unfamiliar things.
5735240	5739240	Also coming to us from Twitter, from Deathwishing, three questions from Deathwishing.
5739240	5742240	Should I buy LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year?
5742240	5746240	Yes, if you like platformers like Mario Brothers, yes, yes, yes, I think it's a great game.
5746240	5748240	It was my game of the year, the year it came out.
5748240	5755240	Plus, you get the beta for ModNation Racers, so you've got to act quick because that just started on the 18th.
5755240	5759240	Socom Confrontation, I guess, is that a game?
5759240	5760240	Confrontation.
5760240	5763240	Confrontation, he spelled it wrong then. Confrontation.
5763240	5765240	And did you guys try out Dante's Inferno?
5765240	5767240	I did not try out Dante's Inferno.
5767240	5770240	I downloaded the demo, I haven't played it yet because I was gone all weekend.
5770240	5772240	I've heard it's pretty terrible.
5772240	5774240	I've already played God of War, thank you.
5774240	5776240	Have you checked out the demo?
5776240	5777240	No, I haven't.
5777240	5779240	I've heard it's pretty bad.
5779240	5784240	But we'll see. Again, I don't like to base games purely off the demo.
5784240	5786240	It's got a level of...
5786240	5788240	Well, it's going to be good.
5788240	5790240	I'll probably play it.
5790240	5794240	I'll tell you right now, there's no way it's going to be Bayonetta.
5794240	5796240	Oh, definitely not going to be Bayonetta.
5796240	5800240	But if you're looking for a game like Dante's Inferno, it's probably dirt cheap right now.
5800240	5802240	I'd go for Conan the Barbarian.
5802240	5804240	Or just Conan.
5804240	5806240	Not Age of Conan.
5806240	5808240	Age of Conan, but Conan that came out on consoles last year.
5808240	5810240	Conan the Librarian.
5810240	5812240	Seriously, it's such a ripoff of God of War, but it's fun.
5812240	5814240	And by now, it's probably like 20 bucks.
5814240	5816240	Less than 20 bucks.
5816240	5818240	Fair enough. Good deal.
5818240	5820240	Gamergirl sent us a tweet.
5820240	5822240	What's your take on Final Fantasy 13? Good or not so good?
5822240	5827240	Couldn't tell you. Didn't import the game. Don't want to pay those types of fees when the game's coming out here in a few months.
5827240	5829240	It's like 100 bucks and it's in Japanese only.
5829240	5831240	I can't justify doing that.
5831240	5834240	But the demo we played a few months ago and...
5834240	5840240	The demo was fun, but once again, you know, I played the demo a few times and I'm like, why did I buy this?
5840240	5841240	Whoops.
5841240	5842240	That's right.
5842240	5844240	But that wasn't anything about the game.
5844240	5846240	It was just, why did you spend so much money on a demo?
5846240	5850240	It's like, oh okay, I don't know what's really going on here.
5850240	5856240	Let's see, look at some other tweets, a couple things of stuff that we did earlier in the show, and that is basically it.
5856240	5858240	So thank you guys for your tweets.
5858240	5860240	Again, we'll take some more next week.
5860240	5864240	Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us on Twitter.
5864240	5866240	Meanwhile, back to some more news.
5866240	5870240	Yes, Nintendo has some interesting things going on.
5870240	5877240	They've announced their new titles coming out in the first part of the year.
5877240	5881240	2010, of course, they're going to launch their first Wii game.
5881240	5886240	It's going to be Endless Ocean 2, the sequel to the Deep Sea Diving Sim.
5886240	5888240	I didn't really play a lot of the first one.
5888240	5894240	It was kind of neat, very pretty, but not something I really want to jump into for the next one.
5894240	5896240	Some DS titles, of course.
5896240	5906240	The newest, I guess I wouldn't really call them brand new, but Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver, the kind of remix of Gold and Silver.
5906240	5909240	And there's some other cool things.
5909240	5913240	WiiWare titles, including And Yet It Moves.
5913240	5916240	Of course, Super Meat Boy is kind of cool.
5916240	5922240	They also have some third-party stuff listed as well.
5922240	5924240	Nothing too stand out from Konami.
5924240	5931240	For example, we've got Dance Dance Revolution, although I believe that's...
5931240	5934240	No, maybe that is a new title, Dance Dance Revolution.
5934240	5938240	I've heard there is some controversy going on right now, because I think that list came out.
5938240	5946240	And right now, that brand new Dance Dance Revolution is only slated for PS3 and Xbox, and wasn't announced for Wii.
5946240	5949240	So it's kind of like, was this the announcement or what?
5949240	5951240	The other thing, too, with Dance Dance Revolution...
5951240	5956240	I could see it probably coming to the Wii, but I remember before, they were kind of lumping in all those games.
5956240	5962240	Before, at E3, as Dance Dance Revolution won, Dance Dance Revolution for the Wii ended up being hottest part, E3.
5962240	5967240	And then, same for the PlayStation 2, it ended up being X2, so...
5967240	5971240	It might not be entirely accurate, but that's alright.
5971240	5977240	I have to say, as a long-time music game fan, and someone who's been critical of DDR over the past few years,
5977240	5982240	I am interested in the reboot game that they're doing on Xbox 360 and PS3, because it is a reboot.
5982240	5986240	Something I've been saying DDR has needed for about five years. We'll see.
5986240	5991240	DDR hasn't just needed a reboot, it's needed a resuscitation and a kick in the ass.
5991240	5994240	And we'll see if this is it, although I will say the expectations are very low.
5994240	5998240	So Konami doesn't have to do much to impress me, so we'll see.
5998240	6006240	The other thing that's going to be coming out also for the DS is WarioWare DIY, which is pretty cool.
6006240	6012240	That's that WarioWare game where you actually create your own mini-games using tools provided in the game,
6012240	6019240	including all sorts of weird things and some perverted things I've seen before on different YouTubes.
6019240	6023240	So that's going to be available as well in March.
6023240	6030240	And then finally, just in time for Valentine's Day, you're going to be getting pink and blue Wii remotes,
6030240	6038240	are going to be released as well, I believe just before Valentine's Day.
6038240	6042240	Yay, just as I always wanted a pink Wiimote.
6042240	6044240	Oh, well then remind me to get you one, Rob.
6044240	6047240	Yay, that's what I want for Christmas. Oh, damn, they're not out until February.
6047240	6048240	Well...
6048240	6049240	Maybe for my birthday.
6049240	6052240	Now if they put out a pink console, that might sell a little bit. I don't know.
6052240	6054240	Possibly.
6054240	6056240	So...
6056240	6057240	Yeah.
6057240	6058240	Alright.
6058240	6060240	The blue one's actually kind of cute.
6060240	6064240	But remember, do you remember at E3 when they first showed the Wii?
6064240	6065240	Mm-hmm.
6065240	6067240	How there were the blue ones and the different colors?
6067240	6072240	Oh yeah, there were all the different colors, but they didn't need to do that because the system sold like fucking nuts anyway, so...
6072240	6073240	Five days.
6073240	6077240	And the curse of the white system did not hurt it.
6077240	6082240	Remember, because the, well, no, the Saturn...
6082240	6085240	Well, I don't know what it is. Alright.
6085240	6088240	The Saturn in Japan came out in white.
6088240	6090240	We got it over here in black. What happened?
6090240	6092240	Poop. Dead.
6092240	6094240	So, see, they learned. They learned.
6094240	6095240	Alright.
6095240	6100240	Well, speaking of Nintendo, I want to get into this story real quick about some new trademarks that Nintendo has recently filed.
6100240	6101240	That's right.
6101240	6107240	Could this mean that a sequel to the Wii is imminent because there is a trademark that has been discovered for the Z?
6107240	6108240	That's right.
6108240	6111240	It's better than Wii because it's further in the alphabet.
6111240	6112240	It's the Z.
6112240	6115240	That's Z-I-I has been trademarked.
6115240	6117240	Now, of course, rumors run rampant.
6117240	6120240	OMG, the Wii HD is the Z!
6120240	6125240	By the way, though, just so you know, Z actually was trademarked in 2006.
6125240	6134240	Also trademarked, the B, the C, the Wii, the YI, and the Z.
6134240	6136240	This Sesame Street...
6136240	6139240	I thought the Wii was oi.
6139240	6142240	Oi, oi, oi, like a punk rock system.
6142240	6144240	No, it's like...
6144240	6146240	It's for the hardcore gamer, the oi, oi.
6146240	6147240	No, it's French.
6147240	6148240	I see.
6148240	6151240	But, you know, also, though, keep in mind, it's like a...
6151240	6154240	You know, that totally made me think of Clue.
6154240	6155240	What?
6155240	6156240	Wii Wii, madame?
6156240	6157240	No, I'm sorry.
6157240	6158240	How do I know this?
6158240	6161240	They neglected the V because that's the one...
6161240	6163240	The Chinese knockoff is called the V, isn't it?
6163240	6164240	Yeah.
6164240	6165240	Whoops, forgot that one.
6165240	6171240	And, most importantly, you forgot the P.
6171240	6172240	Where's the P?
6172240	6174240	In the toilet!
6174240	6176240	Ah!
6176240	6177240	And they missed...
6177240	6178240	Someone had to go there.
6178240	6179240	Now, see what's funny?
6179240	6180240	Somebody in chat said they forgot Xii.
6180240	6183240	Wasn't that the name of a game on PlayStation?
6183240	6184240	I want to say.
6184240	6185240	No, that was 13.
6185240	6190240	Oh, so Xii was not taken by Xiiii was.
6190240	6192240	She, though...
6192240	6193240	That sounds familiar.
6193240	6194240	I don't know.
6194240	6199240	The Z thing, though, and, unfortunately, I don't have the ability to put that clip on,
6199240	6204240	you know, our stream right now, but Z reminds me of Charlie the Unicorn, the second one,
6204240	6208240	where they go and they meet Z and they start speaking Spanish to the Z.
6208240	6210240	I remember that.
6210240	6215240	And that would be totally appropriate for this, but...
6215240	6219240	Deathwishing in chat says, the Nintendo oi with oi circle pit, run and mosh your face
6219240	6220240	off.
6220240	6221240	See, it's for the hardcore gamer.
6221240	6222240	That's exactly what it is.
6222240	6226240	We're going to do another story real quick here, but I wanted to introduce someone who
6226240	6228240	just walked into the studio tonight.
6228240	6230240	Say hello to Tiara.
6230240	6232240	Why, hello there.
6232240	6233240	How are you?
6233240	6234240	I'm good, thank you.
6234240	6235240	Thanks for joining us tonight.
6235240	6236240	How have you been?
6236240	6237240	You're tardy.
6237240	6238240	You know we start at 6 o'clock, right?
6238240	6239240	Yeah, I know.
6239240	6240240	I went out on a date.
6240240	6242240	Wait, hold on, hold on.
6242240	6243240	Aren't you just visiting?
6243240	6248240	Yeah, I'm visiting Jamie and I went out on a date with not Jamie.
6248240	6250240	You're a very naughty girl.
6250240	6251240	Did you have fun?
6251240	6252240	Yes, I did.
6252240	6255240	We saw The Blind Side, which I expected to hate, but apparently I like Sandra Bullock
6255240	6258240	when she's not in a funny movie.
6258240	6259240	Okay.
6259240	6260240	Because she's not funny.
6260240	6261240	There you go.
6261240	6262240	Fair enough.
6262240	6263240	She's not...
6263240	6265240	The Net was not very good either when she...
6265240	6269240	Well, no, that was unintentionally funny, I think, is the point there.
6269240	6271240	So how have you been?
6271240	6275240	I know you've been working on your blog and I see you posting away on the Twitters and
6275240	6277240	feel free to plug whatever, but what have you been up to lately?
6277240	6282240	Dude, I have played the hell out of Final Fantasy IV, the after years.
6282240	6284240	That game is so awesome.
6284240	6285240	I never finished it.
6285240	6288240	I feel bad because it was pretty badass, the parts that I played.
6288240	6292240	I played the opening chapter and I think I played a little bit of Rydia's side story,
6292240	6294240	but lots and lots of side stories to beat in that game.
6294240	6295240	Yeah, I have to be honest.
6295240	6301240	I didn't buy all of them, but I played through the opening chapter, which is the first three,
6301240	6305240	and then I played through part of Rydia's chapter before I drove up here.
6305240	6310240	So I'm excited to go home and play that and have the Wii Fit tell me how fat I am because
6310240	6312240	it loves to do that.
6312240	6313240	I know.
6313240	6316240	It's always kind of a downer to get on Wii Fit and then you watch as your character goes
6316240	6317240	whoop.
6317240	6319240	It's like, oh.
6319240	6321240	But surely that hasn't happened for you.
6321240	6323240	You actually look like you've lost a little bit.
6323240	6324240	Oh, well thank you.
6324240	6325240	Wii Fit's been working for you.
6325240	6326240	Well, it's fun.
6326240	6328240	I'm a master of the hula hoop now.
6328240	6330240	If only in real life.
6330240	6332240	That was a good useful skill, but no.
6332240	6334240	And you're still blogging, right?
6334240	6336240	You're still doing your comic book reviews and so forth, right?
6336240	6344240	Yeah, I still have my blog over at AvengersTower.com and Jamie blogs over there with me occasionally.
6344240	6351240	Yeah, and I'm also blogging over at EatsleepGeek.com, which is another fun geeky blog.
6351240	6352240	Cool.
6352240	6353240	Who runs that?
6353240	6354240	A bunch of geeks?
6354240	6356240	Yes, I would have to say so.
6356240	6357240	It's not just a clever name.
6357240	6358240	Very good.
6358240	6360240	So are we ever going to start now?
6360240	6366240	I've heard rumors that someday there might be a giggling girl comic book show of sorts.
6366240	6369240	Well, Jamie and I had talked about that.
6369240	6374240	We had talked about doing kind of like a mini podcast for one of our weekly features for
6374240	6381240	my blog, but we never have time and of course I'm trying to graduate next year, so I'm taking
6381240	6383240	like eight classes in the semester.
6383240	6384240	She's already got a show.
6384240	6387240	Quit trying to ninja the hosts.
6387240	6389240	Quit trying to ninja them into your show.
6389240	6390240	I'm just kidding.
6390240	6393240	We're using that computer.
6393240	6398240	No, I heard they're going to borrow the show computer to do a side project, so that's awesome.
6398240	6401240	I hope you guys are able to find the time, but certainly school is school.
6401240	6402240	Yes, indeed.
6402240	6403240	All right.
6403240	6408240	If you ever need a guest who never reads comic books, I will totally come on and be like
6408240	6412240	the gay guy on the show that says witty things.
6412240	6414240	I will totally book you for that.
6414240	6415240	Awesome.
6415240	6418240	In my comics, I don't know anything about that, but Wolverine is hot.
6418240	6419240	Exactly.
6419240	6421240	I need you to call my manager, though.
6421240	6422240	Oh, okay.
6422240	6424240	I'll give you my card.
6424240	6425240	Don't call us.
6425240	6426240	We'll call you.
6426240	6427240	All right.
6427240	6429240	No, but feel free, please, to pipe in.
6429240	6432240	Unfortunately, we don't have a fourth mic in the studio because we're a little ghetto,
6432240	6434240	but if you want to say something, raise your hand.
6434240	6435240	A little ghetto?
6435240	6438240	Just reach your hand out and grab my mic, or grab Loki.
6438240	6439240	He's closest.
6439240	6440240	All right.
6440240	6443240	Anyhow, moving on with some more gaming news, Dark Sakura.
6443240	6447240	Oh, for the record, and completely off topic, you know how you're wondering if there was
6447240	6450240	a game called Z?
6450240	6456240	There was an alternate reality game that came out on the PS3 for PlayStation Home.
6456240	6457240	That's right.
6457240	6462240	Also, Devil Dice was called Psy, which was spelled X-I.
6462240	6465240	So, we've had X-I, X-I-I, and X-I-I-I.
6465240	6466240	We've had stuff.
6466240	6470240	Well, I would like to create X-I-I-I-I, patent pending.
6470240	6472240	Although, I guess that would really be...
6472240	6473240	What, 13?
6473240	6475240	No, X-I-I-I-I, 14.
6475240	6477240	So, should it be X-I-V?
6477240	6480240	You shut your mouth!
6480240	6481240	La-la-la.
6481240	6482240	Okay.
6482240	6484240	So, how about my story, huh?
6484240	6485240	How about your story?
6485240	6487240	Yeah, how about that?
6487240	6491240	How about a particular rumor about a game I'm particularly looking forward to?
6491240	6498240	For Super Street Fighter IV, the rumor is that they're getting ten new characters total.
6498240	6511240	There's actually something based off of a clip from the Thummie stream that's showing a different list on here.
6511240	6514240	So, let me see if I can't find...
6514240	6516240	Who else might be included on here?
6516240	6526240	Well, I know for a fact that they're getting a DJ in Feilong, and Adon, and...
6526240	6527240	Guy and Cody, right?
6527240	6529240	Guy and Cody, and...
6529240	6535240	I don't think they've announced any new ones, but there's, like, placeholders here, right?
6535240	6548240	Yeah, well, see, there's four here that are completely blank according to this, and I can actually link the clip to the chatroom if they want to look at it.
6548240	6553240	It definitely, I think, would be worth seeing.
6553240	6555240	But from what I can tell on here...
6555240	6557240	No, Dan, you can't talk to me right now.
6557240	6558240	Sorry.
6558240	6563240	What I can tell on here is that...
6563240	6573240	Yeah, I recognize just about everybody else on here, so I wouldn't think of who they could have put in unless they're adding in, like, Charlie, and Rolando, and maybe Hagar.
6573240	6581240	What's interesting is that the game, we were only supposed to be getting, like, six, I think, in an earlier review, or maybe it was seven or eight, but now it's up to ten.
6581240	6583240	Like, it's almost like they can't put this down.
6583240	6586240	They can't get away from this project, which is, you know, it's a good thing.
6586240	6590240	It means that they really love it, but that's a lot of new characters too.
6590240	6595240	It's just these four empty slots on here, it makes me wonder, you know, what's going to go in.
6595240	6600240	This has to be from some kind of beta or demo on here.
6600240	6603240	Clearly one is going to be for Yoda, and one is going to be for Darth Vader.
6603240	6606240	Obviously, this is the download content.
6606240	6611240	I think that it should have the Tatsunoko versus Capcom people thrown in.
6611240	6618240	Some folks in the chatroom, Leo Shen says it's Ibuki, Dudley, and Makoto from what I heard, and I know the Ibuki rumor has been all around the internet.
6618240	6622240	And then Bob Coffee says Hakan equals an Arab oil dude.
6622240	6625240	Ono talked about but hasn't been revealed yet.
6625240	6631240	And I've heard that rumor too, that there was some type of, like, oil tycoon fighter in it as well.
6631240	6635240	Okay, Game Guru, is Charlie really dead or is he Jean Grey dead?
6635240	6637240	Answer that.
6637240	6641240	Maybe Street Fighter is like Heroes, where people die but they don't ever, like, die.
6641240	6643240	Maybe it's like Heroes where they get their brains eaten.
6643240	6649240	Or maybe it's like Heroes where it starts to suck by the third season, but then gets good again at the fourth season.
6649240	6654240	And then I stopped watching it at the fourth season, but apparently, you know.
6654240	6660240	Of course you realize all I know about Heroes is the brain eating, and the cheerleader is like Wolverine.
6660240	6664240	Look, I'm just saying, Street Fighter doesn't have Zachary Quinto, okay? That's all I'm saying.
6664240	6666240	That's all I'm saying. ZQ or GTFO.
6666240	6675240	Maybe it's like that episode of Heroes where Spock accidentally blows up Romulus and Nero goes back in time to find him.
6675240	6684240	Perhaps. Actually, in an unrelated story that I don't think we covered yet, but did you hear about that, that ZQ actually announced this week at the Video Game Awards?
6684240	6686240	He's going to be doing the voice for Star Trek Online.
6686240	6687240	Yes.
6687240	6692240	I guess, like, doing the opening narration or whatever, and I'm just like, he can talk to me anytime he wants.
6692240	6695240	But he will be doing a William Shatner impression.
6695240	6696240	No.
6696240	6701240	You know what, by the way, I have decided to get the Amazon one, because I want a Borg chick.
6701240	6702240	Okay, fair enough.
6702240	6703240	She wants a Borg chick.
6703240	6706240	I want a really ugly, I want a really ugly Borg chick.
6706240	6708240	You want a Borg chick? What? No, I'm just kidding.
6708240	6710240	I haven't decided which version of the game I'm getting yet.
6710240	6722240	All I know is that I kind of want to play like a sassy Vulcan, which I know is kind of a contradiction, but I think sometimes the only logic is sass.
6722240	6728240	Okay, I'm going to totally out myself as a super nerd, but I read the Star Trek novels.
6728240	6729240	Nerd!
6729240	6736240	And in the novels, there's a half-Vulcan who totally rejects her Vulcan side and is kind of sassy.
6736240	6739240	So, yeah, you could be sassy.
6739240	6743240	I can't play MMOs and not be sassy. It's my thing.
6743240	6745240	Remember, we have to make the O.L. Orient.
6745240	6747240	That's true, and I'll have one of those.
6747240	6749240	You have to be sassy in the pants.
6749240	6751240	I have to have a sassy Vulcan.
6751240	6753240	You have to be sassy in the pants.
6753240	6755240	That's right. Absolutely.
6755240	6757240	I started playing WoW again, Rob. Did you see that?
6757240	6759240	Sucker! How's it going?
6759240	6765240	It's going good. My priest is almost 43. I've been using that dungeon finder thing.
6765240	6768240	And Jamie's on the phone with Dan.
6768240	6770240	That must be important.
6770240	6772240	The dungeon finder's great, though.
6772240	6778240	Oh, yeah. I leveled from 37 to 42 in two days just doing that. So nice.
6778240	6780240	It wasn't important.
6780240	6784240	I'm also getting Star Trek Online, obviously, because I'm a big, huge nerd.
6784240	6786240	Final Fantasy XIV we talked about earlier in the show.
6786240	6788240	Eh, eh, eh. What?
6788240	6792240	Probably not.
6792240	6793240	All right. Fair enough.
6793240	6795240	Some comments in chat about the sassy Vulcan.
6795240	6801240	Salacious Pop says, instead of saying, that's not logical, she says, so ignorant.
6801240	6803240	So ignorant.
6803240	6808240	SSG 100 Matt says, Rob's character, live long and prosper, bitch.
6808240	6811240	That's a good one. I like that.
6811240	6813240	We'll see what happens there.
6813240	6817240	Also, Tigerclaw's letting me know some specifics on that.
6817240	6820240	Apparently, he's also doing the voice of the emergency medical hologram.
6820240	6822240	Although, I gotta say, come on.
6822240	6824240	The guy who did it, what was his name?
6824240	6830240	The emergency hologram program, Robert Picardo or whatever his name was in Voyager.
6830240	6834240	When you think emergency medical program, I always think of him.
6834240	6837240	Remember how they got him a cameo in First Contact?
6837240	6841240	We watched some of that last night.
6841240	6844240	Did you really? I was watching through your window.
6844240	6847240	I wanted to be at your slumber party, but I couldn't and I was jealous.
6847240	6850240	What was it you were saying? We were going for the whole revenge theme?
6850240	6852240	Because we watched Wrath of Khan before that?
6852240	6856240	We watched Wrath of Khan and then she said, I wanted to watch good Star Trek movies,
6856240	6859240	but she tried to put in Star Trek 3.
6859240	6861240	I like Star Trek 3.
6861240	6863240	I actually like that one.
6863240	6866240	Dan lost my copy.
6866240	6868240	Anyhow, sorry, let's get into some other gaming news.
6868240	6871240	Just a couple quick articles. We're going to get to the mail back here very soon. Loki.
6871240	6879240	Yes, Nintendo has trademarked what is going to be about equally retarded as the Wii Vitality Sensor.
6879240	6882240	Wii Relax.
6882240	6886240	Yes, it's a game about relaxing.
6886240	6891240	It involves you putting on a Vitality Sensor so that you can relax.
6891240	6894240	Relax or die.
6894240	6899240	Actually, wasn't there a mode? I think it's in Wii Fit.
6899240	6902240	One of the games, I think it's one of the last things you unlock is a
6902240	6907240	sit on the balance board as still as you possibly can.
6907240	6910240	If your fat ass moves too much, you're going to blow out the candle.
6910240	6913240	It's like a relaxed mini-game or something.
6913240	6914240	I seem to remember.
6914240	6918240	Now you're telling me that don't move your ass is turning into a full game?
6918240	6924240	Isn't that kind of counter-intuitive with the whole Wii Fit?
6924240	6928240	Am I supposed to be moving?
6928240	6933240	Well, no. The only thing I've ever known, like any type of exercise thing I've ever done
6933240	6938240	where you have to keep perfectly still is doing isolation exercises.
6938240	6940240	Other than that, I don't know.
6940240	6945240	I'm grabbing at straws here. I'm trying to find some logic in this.
6945240	6948240	I don't know. Hopefully the game is going to say, you know,
6948240	6952240	relax, but don't touch yourself.
6952240	6954240	No wanking.
6954240	6959240	Wait a second. Game's going to be like, please put it on your finger.
6959240	6962240	Wait a second. That is not your finger.
6962240	6964240	Stop that. That is dirty.
6964240	6969240	Please do not be fapping.
6969240	6973240	It'll be like Miss Nude World 96 where if it detects something bad going on,
6973240	6977240	then the image flips to the devil picture.
6977240	6980240	Honestly, like a whole two people have probably ever played that game in MAME
6980240	6983240	and get that reference, but Loki's raising his hand.
6983240	6986240	Somebody out there will understand what I'm talking about, and it's quite funny.
6986240	6988240	I promise.
6988240	6990240	Anyhow.
6990240	6991240	Other things.
6991240	6994240	I like how they show this girl in the picture that they picked.
6994240	6998240	She looks like either a mannequin or a corpse.
6998240	7001240	Can't get more relaxed than a corpse.
7001240	7006240	I can just see it now. Person dies while playing Wii Relax, and the game never knew.
7006240	7008240	High score.
7008240	7012240	World Record and Wii Relax.
7012240	7014240	Anyhow, that's terrible.
7014240	7018240	Hey, we should do that. We should try to go for the World Record.
7018240	7020240	And Wii Relax? No, then we'll die.
7020240	7025240	That's the only way you're going to get the World Record is to die while playing Wii Relax.
7025240	7027240	It's worth it.
7027240	7029240	No.
7029240	7031240	I like the whole living thing.
7031240	7036240	I like this idea better. How about we go kill a million freaking zombies?
7036240	7039240	That would be super awesome. That always makes a good game.
7039240	7042240	Hence why Left 4 Dead is so freaking amazing.
7042240	7048240	Apparently, what's going on here is that they're going to get characters from the original Left 4 Dead
7048240	7053240	to now hang out with the new characters.
7053240	7057240	So apparently the old characters and the new characters from Left 4 Dead 2
7057240	7062240	will meet in a game called The Passing, or a download content piece.
7062240	7065240	It's called The Most Important Campaign in the Left 4 Dead Story.
7065240	7068240	All the survivors are being called together in one campaign.
7068240	7071240	That's from the Valve VP of Marketing, Doug Lombardi.
7071240	7074240	That's going to come out in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PC.
7074240	7080240	It's going to have a co-op campaign in rural Georgia and a cooperative challenge mode of play.
7080240	7082240	There will be survival versus a scavenge mode.
7082240	7088240	If you play as the Left 4 Dead 2 cast, you get a new melee weapon, firearm, and uncommon common zombie.
7088240	7092240	That's kind of interesting that they are going to bring the two worlds together.
7092240	7095240	But kind of cool. I bet fans of the series are going to be very excited about that.
7095240	7099240	I wonder if that also means that maybe there's going to be an eight player type of mode now.
7099240	7102240	That sounds like it could be pretty awesome.
7102240	7104240	So there you go.
7104240	7106240	Coming soon.
7106240	7108240	Coming to you right now is the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.
7108240	7111240	It's the part of the show every week where we take some emails and read them for you.
7111240	7113240	Live on air.
7113240	7117240	So Dark Sakura, please open up the meal bag.
7117240	7120240	What? I can't talk tonight.
7120240	7123240	I'm broken. I need to be fixed.
7123240	7125240	Not in that way.
7125240	7127240	I need to wee relax.
7127240	7129240	You need to get us cupcakes.
7129240	7131240	I do not need a god damn cupcake.
7131240	7134240	You need to get us cupcakes.
7134240	7136240	How's that going to help me?
7136240	7140240	You'll be doing a good deed and it will make you feel better in your heart.
7140240	7145240	Isn't wee relax thinking about baseball anyways?
7145240	7148240	Wee relax is mean...
7148240	7150240	Think about it.
7150240	7155240	And it makes your wee relax.
7155240	7157240	They should do wee irritate.
7157240	7159240	Mailbag!
7159240	7164240	Well this is sort of a mass email so I'm going to go ahead and read it.
7164240	7166240	I have a question.
7166240	7168240	If a kid has the money to get a console but no games,
7168240	7171240	should the parent get the games for that console?
7171240	7173240	For me, it is an Xbox 360.
7173240	7175240	I can only survive on demos for so long.
7175240	7177240	Sincerely, DS Master 26.
7177240	7181240	P.S. This is typed on a wee with wee mode and I'm visually impaired and lawsuits are a disgrace.
7181240	7183240	Shame on him.
7183240	7188240	Okay. McDonald's is an equal opportunity employer.
7188240	7191240	You can get a job and save up and buy yourself some games.
7191240	7194240	Parents don't have to buy you shit.
7194240	7199240	Parents might reward you with games or consoles or what have you
7199240	7201240	if you've been a good little boy and or girl
7201240	7204240	and you do chores around the house and what have you.
7204240	7209240	Or maybe you're in a household where you're fortunate enough to be spoiled to your heart's content
7209240	7211240	like maybe Paris Hilton was when she was growing up.
7211240	7214240	Unfortunately, that's not the way most of us have it.
7214240	7219240	So parents don't have to buy anything at all.
7219240	7222240	In fact, keep in mind in this economy of people losing their jobs and stuff,
7222240	7226240	some parents can't afford to buy games at all.
7226240	7232240	So you might be lucky to be getting a variety puzzle book from Penny Press.
7232240	7238240	If you've got a Wii and an Xbox 360, you can sell one of them to get games for the other.
7238240	7246240	The reason I can get away with having all of these systems is because, well, until I hurt my hand,
7246240	7248240	I had enough money to buy them.
7248240	7254240	In certain states, if you're like 14, you can get a work permit and go work at certain places.
7254240	7258240	And you know what? It's not a bad idea because work experience goes a long way.
7258240	7262240	I mean, you might not want to work, but if you want a really cushy job in the future,
7262240	7266240	working the crap jobs now help get you there faster.
7266240	7267240	Moulins.
7267240	7269240	So just something to think about.
7269240	7271240	Moulins unless you have lethal allergies.
7271240	7273240	So, yeah, you'll find something.
7273240	7279240	If you were skilled enough to type this email on a Wii or whatever,
7279240	7281240	you probably can help old ladies and old men set up.
7281240	7283240	It just says visually impaired.
7283240	7287240	Still, you can probably help old ladies and old men get their computers set up or something.
7287240	7290240	I bet there's a lot of things that you probably can still do.
7290240	7292240	Yeah, you just have to look around for it.
7292240	7297240	And on top of that, it's not like you can't start a change jar.
7297240	7303240	But maybe your parents don't want you to get a job at 14, and that's their prerogative.
7303240	7306240	You know, my parents didn't want me to have a job that young because they wanted me to focus on studying.
7306240	7310240	So maybe try to work something out with your parents.
7310240	7311240	You get an allowance?
7311240	7313240	I want this game. How can I get this game?
7313240	7318240	Can I get a job? Can I do chores around the house? Can I get good grades?
7318240	7321240	That's not something I got the answer to.
7321240	7325240	Your parents will raise you however they want and or can.
7325240	7333240	Or, you know, and certainly in other cases, you know, when I say parents, I mean whoever is caring for you right now.
7333240	7334240	Legal guardian.
7334240	7337240	Your guardians, et cetera, et cetera, just because there's many different types of families out there.
7337240	7338240	I just want to point that out.
7338240	7340240	Okay. The last one is big.
7340240	7342240	Ah, long email.
7342240	7348240	Okay, hey, OLR crew, since I probably can't make it to tonight's episode due to finals and such, ooh, I'm sorry,
7348240	7351240	I thought I'd email my review of the game I'd like to share with everyone.
7351240	7357240	Mushihime-sama Futari, a 2D bullet hell shooter from awesome folks at Cave.
7357240	7364240	For those who haven't been caught up on the recent shmup news, the recent Xbox 360 port of Futari is region-free.
7364240	7368240	Having heard this news, I preordered my copy and received it within a week and a half of it shipping out.
7368240	7370240	So far, the game is mind-blowing.
7370240	7375240	After having played Touhou for a few months, Futari is especially pretty in comparison.
7375240	7378240	The games are very nicely detailed and vivid.
7378240	7383240	Although there is slowdown, it's implemented on purpose in order to make the game easier at times.
7383240	7388240	As far as play options and modes go, Futari offers a wide variety of them.
7388240	7392240	You can customize the game's display to your liking from the rotation of the screen,
7392240	7395240	for those dedicated enough to rotate their TVs for vertical shooters,
7395240	7399240	to more intricate details like display filters and scan lines.
7399240	7404240	The main mode, version 1.5, offers three difficulty levels from the arcade, original, fairly simple gameplay,
7404240	7408240	maniac, more difficult bullet patterns and an engaging scoring system,
7408240	7414240	and the infamous ultra difficulty, home of the final boss that is featured in many a YouTube video.
7414240	7418240	Then there's a range mode, a unique and complex twist on the regular gameplay,
7418240	7425240	with the ability to switch characters as well as slow down bullets close to you and reflect them back to crank out tons of points.
7425240	7429240	And if you're looking for stress relief or are bad at shooters, there's the novice mode,
7429240	7433240	a glorified easy mode that offers the easy versions of original, maniac, and ultra.
7433240	7436240	I tried novice ultra, and the bullet patterns are dense enough that you go,
7436240	7443240	ah, wow, but they have very sensible gaps so you can enjoy the pretty bullet patterns without having to struggle to avoid them.
7443240	7448240	I beat this mode on one credit on my first try, and I still found it to be a very fun experience.
7448240	7451240	Overall, I really like this game. It's worth the $70 I paid for it,
7451240	7456240	and yes, I just said that a non-multi-hour game is worth $70.
7456240	7458240	Holy shit, I just committed a capital offense.
7458240	7463240	Every time I do a session of futari, I come across something new that just amazes me,
7463240	7469240	whether it's a new scoring trick, a new way to dodge bullet barrages, or a game mechanic I wasn't fully aware of.
7469240	7474240	Arrangement, for instance, took me two playthroughs of this rather fun mode to get to grips with its mechanics.
7474240	7477240	My one complaint so far is the pricing of the expansion pack.
7477240	7485240	The Mushihime Futari Black Label offers revised original and maniac modes as well as a new god mode that is like ultra mode,
7485240	7488240	but with somewhat less retardedness. Is that a word?
7488240	7489240	And new shot types.
7489240	7495240	While I like Black Label, I question whether it's worth the 1200 Microsoft points,
7495240	7499240	especially since I can get Raiden Fighter's Aces 3 games in one for $5 more,
7499240	7504240	or one of a handful of standalone shmups for anywhere between $5 to $10.
7504240	7508240	If you're a dedicated bullet hell fan or have an Xbox 360 of any region lying around,
7508240	7511240	you owe it to yourself to snap up a copy of Futari for $360.
7511240	7516240	I mean, hey, 70 bucks? At least you're not paying triple digits for the arcade hardware.
7516240	7518240	And that's from Ray Ayanami slash GS68.
7518240	7523240	PS, this email is brought to you by San Jose State University, home of the never-ending for low days.
7523240	7525240	It's on the list of things to play.
7525240	7531240	The next one on my list other than Bayonetta for my Japanese region system was Ootomedia is Gorgeous
7531240	7533240	was the next one I wanted to play.
7533240	7539240	Then, of course, the one he mentioned was third on the list.
7539240	7546240	That's so interesting, though, that it would actually put a mode in there for you to, like, turn the TV around.
7546240	7547240	Do those people do that?
7547240	7552240	No, we actually bought a monitor, and it turned out that the monitor wasn't the right type.
7552240	7555240	We bought an EGA monitor by accident, but it had a rotation.
7555240	7558240	In fact, Dan's monitor here rotates.
7558240	7563240	So he's actually pulled out the monitor and rotated it to play shmups,
7563240	7568240	because I think he got, like, Raiden and Raiden 2 to run on MAME.
7568240	7571240	So, yeah, he's... it works.
7571240	7573240	Hmm.
7573240	7576240	All right, well, thank you for the review. We appreciate it.
7576240	7578240	And, of course, you can always send in your own game review if you want to.
7578240	7581240	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send emails.
7581240	7582240	Was that it for emails tonight?
7582240	7583240	It was indeed.
7583240	7584240	Well, then, there you go.
7584240	7586240	So let's move on to some more stories.
7586240	7591240	Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7591240	7592240	But not just yet.
7592240	7595240	For now, let's do some last few stories here.
7595240	7598240	Well, before we do stories, though...
7598240	7601240	Oh! Gosh, that's right, we have to get to the angst.
7601240	7603240	Well, not now, because DarkSaga just ran to use the potty.
7603240	7604240	So we'll do the stories in the angst.
7604240	7606240	She went through a different type of angst.
7606240	7607240	Yes.
7607240	7613240	Anyways, there's a rumor that NHL 2K11 may be cancelled.
7613240	7618240	And maybe 2K Sports is in some sort of financial trouble.
7618240	7628240	This is coming from the recently released Take-Two's Q4 fiscal 2009 results.
7628240	7633240	There's a section of games that the publisher is currently planning to ship in 2010.
7633240	7640240	Both MLB 2K10 and NBA 2K11 are listed on the report, although I would think it's...
7640240	7642240	I can't remember if it's 2K9.
7642240	7643240	Yeah, I guess that's right there.
7643240	7644240	You're behind or whatever.
7644240	7653240	Anyways, and of course, that NHL 2K11 is not on the list.
7653240	7654240	It's interesting.
7654240	7663240	It says, we are currently in the process of evaluating our sports portfolio and have not announced any new NHL titles at this time.
7663240	7668240	And that's a pretty damning statement, they put it.
7668240	7680240	And also seeing that if NHL 2K is no more, the franchise appears to be dying the same death as College Hoops 2K series.
7680240	7687240	So they're kind of slim-lining their portfolio as far as their sports games.
7687240	7695240	And honestly, I'm kind of surprised with the NHL stuff because I always thought that NHL 2K did a lot better than the NHL...
7695240	7702240	EA's NHL games, and I think it was a better put-together game.
7702240	7711240	At least my friend at work who's really huge in the hockey used to pick up the 2K series quite often, and he seemed to like it a lot better.
7711240	7713240	But, eh, who knows?
7713240	7731240	And of course, they're wondering that maybe 2K Sports as a publisher might be in some trouble as well, seeing as MLB 2K apparently didn't do that well last year, or I should say earlier this year.
7731240	7743240	Also, some of the EA games hockey stuff has done a lot better than NHL 2K, regardless of quality.
7743240	7756240	And of course, since EA has the NFL license still, they can't even really make a football game, even though they did try with that All-American Football 2K or whatever that sucked.
7756240	7762240	Well, I hope it's not that a series is going away, because that's going to leave very few hockey simulation games.
7762240	7768240	So, you know, I always am a fan of more competition, that's for sure.
7768240	7773240	One other story for you guys before we get to the FUs of the Week and then the Skype line, and that has to do with Champions Online.
7773240	7780240	And if you played and disliked Champion Online, which as I understand many of you did, maybe a giant teddy bear will change your mind.
7780240	7784240	That's right, Mecha Teddy has made its way into Champions Online.
7784240	7789240	It's called the Attack of the Misfit Toys, it's a seasonal event that's going on in Champions Online right now.
7789240	7793240	And I guess it has a new villain called Black Harlequin is one villain in it.
7793240	7797240	And there's also a villain that is just a giant mechanical teddy bear.
7797240	7802240	So if you want to kill a big teddy bear, make your way to Champions Online right now.
7802240	7803240	That's awesome.
7803240	7807240	I have to admit, that is kind of awesome, but I've heard the game was not anything to scream about.
7807240	7811240	But sometimes MMOs have rough launches and then they get better as time goes on.
7811240	7815240	I mean let's face it, how many times did Warcraft evolve, right?
7815240	7818240	I mean Warcraft didn't really get rolling until it was out for a couple of years.
7818240	7820240	How long until Warcraft gets giant teddy bears?
7820240	7823240	I don't know, who knows.
7823240	7825240	Anyhow, there are no-
7825240	7827240	What is Warcraft doing for their holiday event?
7827240	7831240	They kind of do the same thing they do usually during the holiday events.
7831240	7832240	There's random Santas all over the place.
7832240	7836240	They call it the festival something, I don't remember.
7836240	7841240	They have to give everything very generic holiday names because they're not taken from the real world.
7841240	7844240	But they do holiday events pretty much the same every year.
7844240	7846240	But sometimes they add new things like a new boss.
7846240	7849240	Or this year they added the Thanksgiving event was brand new.
7849240	7851240	So they kind of go back to the calendar and add new things.
7851240	7853240	But they do holidays throughout the year.
7853240	7857240	Anyhow, let's get to the FUs of the week because I missed doing it earlier.
7857240	7877240	But I just wanted to talk about teddy bears. Can you blame me?
7877240	7880240	You know what? I've had a really great weekend.
7880240	7890240	So I can't really say FU to anything except maybe situations regarding a late paycheck and EDD.
7890240	7896240	I've heard that California, I don't know about disability, but unemployment especially had some hurdles recently too.
7896240	7898240	I don't know if that affected all ends of it.
7898240	7905240	I'm actually more pissed off at EDD for not sending me certain paperwork that I needed to fill out three weeks ago.
7905240	7909240	So I'm still waiting on three weeks of pay.
7909240	7914240	But starting next week though, I'm back to getting some of my regular checks.
7914240	7915240	Woot.
7915240	7916240	Loki.
7916240	7928240	FU to people that think it's necessary to put inflatable holiday decorations out on their lawn and or house.
7928240	7931240	Apparently it is just really prevalent this year.
7931240	7932240	I mean, they're all over the fucking place.
7932240	7935240	In fact, our neighbor's house across the street decided,
7935240	7940240	Hey, you'll be a great idea. Let's put Frosty the snowman on our roof with some presents.
7940240	7943240	It looks like a giant fucking snowman is attacking the house.
7943240	7947240	It is just retarded and people need to...
7947240	7949240	Maybe that's the next champions online boss. Who knows?
7949240	7950240	They need to cut it back.
7950240	7954240	I mean, because they've got all sorts of inflatable things from, you know,
7954240	7960240	giant snow globes to there's a guy in the corner that has Santa riding a Harley.
7960240	7967240	It's ridiculous. And I mean, it's just another thing that the holiday can barf onto your house
7967240	7971240	because there's some people that have everything and they just keep adding every year.
7971240	7975240	And oh my God, one house looks like they threw the lights just over the house and that's it.
7975240	7977240	It's sad.
7977240	7981240	I like Dark Sakura. Things are pretty good for me right now.
7981240	7983240	So I don't have a lot of angst actually.
7983240	7987240	But I will say FU to mob mentality, especially on the internets.
7987240	7989240	God, some people are real sheep.
7989240	7992240	Clearly I'm not talking about any of you, of course.
7992240	7993240	Folks listening, what have you.
7993240	7997240	It's just things I observe as I lurk on the internets.
7997240	8002240	Well, I do also, though, think there should be an FU directed to that site too.
8002240	8004240	Oh yeah, of course. Well, that goes...
8004240	8006240	God, they got 20 minutes of an FU earlier.
8006240	8008240	I don't need to give them any more time.
8008240	8011240	All right. And of course, how could we forget Tiara's here?
8011240	8014240	Maybe she wants to get in on the angst tonight.
8014240	8019240	I would like to say FU to people who deny the Holocaust.
8019240	8022240	How can you do that?
8022240	8026240	I know. I'm laughing because it's ridiculous.
8026240	8034240	Well, a PE teacher in Las Vegas was suspended for telling students that the Holocaust didn't exist
8034240	8037240	and that photographs were doctored, textbooks are inaccurate,
8037240	8040240	and that the Nazis lacked the technology to kill so many people.
8040240	8045240	And I just hope they fire her. FU to that lady.
8045240	8049240	Wow. Wow. That's all I can say is wow.
8049240	8051240	I don't know. I kind of put...
8051240	8057240	Well, that's really bad, but the whole 9-11 conspiracy theories, like...
8057240	8060240	Come on. Really?
8060240	8067240	Well, first of all, in both situations you've got first person accounts from people who were there.
8067240	8070240	You know, it's ridiculous.
8070240	8076240	You know, I realize we have freedom of speech and all in this country, but good Lord.
8076240	8077240	Use it appropriately.
8077240	8081240	All right. Anyhow, we've got to get to the phones.
8081240	8084240	We're actually going to start off tonight with a caller who should already be on the line.
8084240	8086240	Caller, are you there?
8086240	8087240	Yes, I'm here.
8087240	8089240	Hi. Who is this?
8089240	8090240	This is SSJ100 Matt.
8090240	8094240	SSJ100 Matt, thank you so much for being on the show tonight. How are you doing?
8094240	8097240	I'm doing very well and it sounds like you guys are doing well, too.
8097240	8099240	Excellent. Yes, actually we're doing pretty good.
8099240	8103240	When two of the three hosts have very little to rant about, it's usually a good night.
8103240	8107240	But what's on your mind? What do we owe this phone call tonight?
8107240	8114240	Well, as many people have been following, the Orange Land Revolution second mix is coming out this week.
8114240	8118240	Yes, we talked about it at the top of the show, of course, but for those that tuned in late,
8118240	8125240	it's like a fan project dedicated to the show, which low-key, myself and Dark Soccer, we didn't do shit for this project.
8125240	8126240	We didn't do anything.
8126240	8134240	Well, not directly. You guys created the shenanigans as the show and we kind of went with it.
8134240	8141240	I would say I'm the lead developer, but you know what? This has all been a group effort.
8141240	8146240	A lot of listeners have contributed and it took us two years,
8146240	8150240	but I think we made a very great game.
8150240	8152240	Well, tell us about some of the thank yous.
8152240	8159240	Who are some of the people we need to give hugs and kisses to for making this game happen besides you?
8159240	8165240	I would say the hardcore listeners. We have Act Def who worked on a couple songs.
8165240	8176240	Dark Tetsuya, Misty, Breslul, who gave us the amazing announcer pack, and a lot of other people I can't even think of.
8176240	8184240	Did you really have to put that guy song in there, though? Because I saw that YouTube and I was like, what is this?
8184240	8189240	It's already bad enough. I was actually listening to Understation Live, not this week, but last week,
8189240	8194240	and I heard that thing, I don't know, it was a song from The Karate Kid or something,
8194240	8198240	and then suddenly it just goes into, the best! The best! The best!
8198240	8205240	And I'm like, what is this? Is this funny? I'm laughing because of how stupid it is.
8205240	8211240	You know I love Breslul and he knows I love him, but there's clearly an inside joke here I'm not understanding,
8211240	8214240	but I'm laughing because it's stupid funny like Showgirls.
8214240	8216240	The inside joke is just John.
8216240	8218240	I see, okay. Fair enough.
8218240	8224240	But, you know, we have a lot of things in there from, you know, back from your old days, from U.S.L.
8224240	8231240	Oh God, oh man, you want to talk about embarrassing stuff? I'd rather the Like a Prayer stuff be released on, like,
8231240	8234240	Entertainment Tonight than some of the old U.S.L. clips.
8234240	8238240	Oh, well, we pretty much have everything that you've sung on there, so.
8238240	8240240	Great.
8240240	8243240	Contributed by a certain Mr. Donovan.
8243240	8249240	Oh, love, oh great, I'm sure. Loki, be glad we didn't know you back then,
8249240	8253240	because Travis had a way of getting you to make an ass out of yourself on the radio.
8253240	8254240	I wouldn't have been.
8254240	8258240	God bless Travis Donovan, I would probably not be doing internet radio right now still if it were not for him.
8258240	8262240	You still remember the number one way to make him upset was to drop the C-bomb.
8262240	8263240	That's right!
8263240	8266240	And you kept doing it.
8266240	8270240	Because it was my favorite word at the time. But anyhow.
8270240	8275240	Well, you know, Loki didn't get unscathed on this, so both of his performances are in the game.
8275240	8276240	Thank God.
8276240	8279240	This is why I don't do karaoke on the internet.
8279240	8283240	Were you able to find anything embarrassing of Dark Sakura?
8283240	8288240	Actually, no, we haven't been able to, you know, we have our archivers, but no one was able to find anything.
8288240	8291240	Ask Travis for the apology song.
8291240	8293240	No!
8293240	8294240	That's all I'm going to say.
8294240	8298240	No, no, no, actually that would piss me off.
8298240	8302240	Beyond piss her off with laughter.
8302240	8306240	I don't understand why we have to get the bad stuff, but...
8306240	8310240	No, that's actually something that I'm still upset with him about, so...
8310240	8314240	Then don't ask him about that. Ask him to hear it, just don't put it in the game.
8314240	8315240	Alright.
8315240	8325240	But, you know, all the things that we put in, you know, we kind of made themed non-stop tracks of, you know, songs that you guys would enjoy.
8325240	8334240	You know, we have a lot of songs from the Cage Match, we got a lot of songs that, you know, you, Jamie, and Matt like.
8334240	8337240	So, you know, it's got pretty much everything in it.
8337240	8341240	Just an all ABBA course for me, of course.
8341240	8348240	Although we don't have a whole lot of ABBA in it, but, you know, we have, like, Skulk, we know you like that.
8348240	8349240	Oh yeah, that's my favorite.
8349240	8358240	We have Castlevania stuff for Jamie, we have a couple of Loki's remixes in there, so, you know, it's really got everything in it.
8358240	8364240	And you know what, it doesn't just end here, we actually are planning on doing DLC for it, so...
8364240	8366240	Oh my god, DLC, that's amazing.
8366240	8372240	And of course this is all free, because it's kind of a rip-off of DDR in the first place, so you can't really charge for it.
8372240	8376240	But if the listeners want to grab it, how can they get a copy of the game?
8376240	8382240	Well, the game comes out on Christmas Eve, so this will be a nice Christmas present for all the OLAR fans.
8382240	8390240	And it will be up on the website, in the forums, so, you know, you'll be able to download it, spread it out, give it to everyone, to your heart's content.
8390240	8394240	That's right, spread it like a badass TD, just go out there and tell all your friends.
8394240	8402240	No, I, you know, and I truly think it's awesome that you guys have spent so much time on what some might view as a silly little project,
8402240	8412240	but I kind of go, wow, the show, like, actually, people wanted to do that for our show, like, it's, I can't describe for you how neat that feels, so...
8412240	8421240	But you know what, we couldn't have been able to do it without you guys, so, you know, if you guys didn't do the show, then, you know, we would have been just nerds hovering around a keyboard.
8421240	8427240	I appreciate it. Maybe that'll be the name of the, you know, the next show in the future, because, you know, all good things must come to an end.
8427240	8434240	OLR will end someday, I mean, it might be ten years from now, but, you know, it's gonna, someday, somebody's gonna wanna move or something.
8434240	8438240	Maybe that'll be the next show, it'll be nerds sitting around a keyboard. We'll see.
8438240	8442240	Maybe the comic book show needs a name, probably, unless you guys already thought of one, I don't know.
8442240	8447240	So maybe, maybe, could say, maybe that one. Giggling girls sitting around a keyboard. And a comic book.
8447240	8454240	Alright. Anyhow, SSG 100 Matt, is there anything else you want to say about the project, or anything else going on in your week that you want to tell us about?
8454240	8464240	Um, nothing really. I mean, I've just been playing, uh, the new crack game that I have is Modern Warfare 2, and, you know, plenty of NHL.
8464240	8471240	But, aside from that, you know, working on this game, so everyone can get it out on Christmas. So, aside from that.
8471240	8478240	Alright. Well, thank you, once again, from all of us here at OLR, SSG 100 Matt, and everybody that worked on the project, all the folks you named, and so forth.
8478240	8487240	Uh, it's a great tribute. As silly as it might be, especially to, I think, those that are going to download it that don't remember the heydays of OLR, and some of the crazy stuff we used to do.
8487240	8493240	They're going to look at it and go, what? But, to us, we get it, and it's a great tribute, and thank you so much.
8493240	8495240	Are there Iraqi suicide babies?
8495240	8499240	That's an old joke. That's good.
8499240	8500240	I can't, I can't say.
8500240	8509240	Ah, might be the toasty thing that comes out, I don't know. Or, uh, what other, like, really, really old jokes do we have on the show? Like, I gotta go way back.
8509240	8510240	Big Black Cock.
8510240	8511240	Big Black Cock, that's old. Oh, man.
8511240	8513240	The King of Iron Fingering.
8513240	8516240	Oh, boy. Now, that's a good Embarrassing Jamie moment, just so you know.
8516240	8518240	Yeah, but that was old, and I don't care anymore.
8518240	8522240	Alright. She's over it now. Alright.
8522240	8531240	But, yeah, definitely check out fans in the chat room, and everyone, check out the Orange Lines Revolution YouTube channel.
8531240	8538240	We're posting up previews of everything, and eventually, you know, we'll post up everything that's on there, but, you know. Check it out now.
8538240	8551240	Thank you so much, and just if you want a little taste, if I could, just real quick, I'm going to go to the YouTube channel real quick here, because I want to play, this is one of the songs that you could actually play in OLR Revolution.
8551240	8554240	So, actually, some of these are, oh, they've added new stuff here.
8554240	8560240	Oh, apparently, the Happy Sky Course has a Freeze Pop song in it, because I recognize that in the background.
8560240	8564240	Let me see here, because I wanted to play that one song that made me go, what?
8564240	8568240	Oh, God, they actually had the video of the Like a Prayer thing there.
8568240	8570240	I hate you.
8570240	8572240	Where was it? Here it is. Here it is.
8572240	8577240	This is one of the great classics you could play in this game.
8577240	8586240	I'm waiting for it to pop.
8586240	8599240	So, it's like the Legend of Max, right, basically? Hold on, wait.
8599240	8610240	Or this one, Gaianora Waternal, if it'll load. Here we go.
8610240	8628240	Here we go.
8628240	8635240	To someone who listens to Understation Live, that's funny. To the rest of us, we're like, what is that?
8635240	8638240	But you all know John, so you know.
8638240	8641240	I know. John needs to come back and visit.
8641240	8648240	Although I have heard rumors, I have heard rumblings that the one and only Travis Donovan is considering a Sacramento visit.
8648240	8653240	We may have Travis Donovan on this very program.
8653240	8658240	And I could have sworn at one point he swore he would never come on Orange Lawn's radio.
8658240	8663240	But that might have changed. It's eight years now, and we may have him on the program.
8663240	8665240	That would be, I can't even...
8665240	8667240	That would be like DC and Marvel.
8667240	8675240	Seriously, set your TiVo's now, kids. That's going to be an amazing show.
8675240	8679240	Alright, ST-100 Matt, thank you so much for the call, and thank you again for all your hard work in this project.
8679240	8680240	It's going to be a lot of fun.
8680240	8681240	Thank you, guys.
8681240	8682240	Alright, take care.
8682240	8683240	Yep, take care.
8683240	8684240	I'd love that call.
8684240	8689240	Thank you. No, thank you. No, no, no. Thank you. No, no, no, no. Thank you.
8689240	8694240	Alright, anyhow, if you want to give us a call and say your thanks, or let us thank you for calling,
8694240	8696240	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.
8696240	8698240	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8698240	8703240	Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, so you can go ahead and give us a call right now.
8703240	8705240	We're taking calls live.
8705240	8711240	While we wait for some calls, since there is a little bit of a buffer between when we say things here in the studio and when you guys hear them on the feed,
8711240	8713240	let's get some last-minute stories. Loki.
8713240	8720240	The Sims 3 is releasing a tool to create your own worlds, so you can build your own towns in those said worlds,
8720240	8725240	and that'll be released soon, although I don't see when.
8725240	8728240	Alright, Russell, Russell, Thumble, Thumble.
8728240	8729240	Hi, caller, are you there?
8729240	8730240	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8730240	8731240	Yes.
8731240	8732240	Hi, who is this?
8732240	8733240	It's Deathwishing.
8733240	8735240	Hi, Deathwishing. What's on your mind?
8735240	8741240	Well, first off, can I say an F you? Because I kind of feel like I probably should have said this instead of what I said.
8741240	8742240	Okay.
8742240	8746240	F you to the Modern Warfare 2 hackers. You ruined it for me.
8746240	8747240	What did they do?
8747240	8757240	This has been lately. I don't know if the patches addressed it yet, but they've actually made it where certain playlists and stuff will put you into hacked games and stuff.
8757240	8766240	I really like the third-person playlists on it, and I'm now getting put into 18-player free-for-all with unlimited noob tube,
8766240	8772240	unlimited ammo with noob tubes, and then when someone gets an AC-130, it's just rapid-fire.
8772240	8775240	130 cannon shots.
8775240	8779240	You know what? I support hacking and cracking your own game.
8779240	8791240	If you want to go hack Modern Warfare so that you jump to the sun whenever you jump or that you have infinite rockets or whatever, go for it.
8791240	8797240	But when you go and force that on other people in multiplayer to inflate your EP to make you feel better, that's just messed up.
8797240	8799240	That's not what the rest of us are paying for.
8799240	8801240	It just stinks.
8801240	8804240	Hack it to your heart's content. Just don't go online with it.
8804240	8806240	And I also got a PS3.
8806240	8809240	Well, congratulations. Did you get any games for it?
8809240	8810240	Not yet.
8810240	8814240	Not yet? Are you thinking? Well, you sent us a tweet earlier.
8814240	8816240	I rented Killzone 2.
8816240	8817240	And how was that?
8817240	8819240	It's beautiful.
8819240	8826240	Now, you were asking us about a lot of retail games, but have you thought about any of the download stuff that PlayStation Network offers?
8826240	8828240	That princess was the first thing that came to mind.
8828240	8829240	Really? Did you get it?
8829240	8831240	No.
8831240	8832240	Half the money.
8832240	8838240	Oh, I see then. Well, maybe for Christmas you'll get some money or some PSN cards and you can talk about a new future show.
8838240	8842240	And I found an old thing you guys didn't think about, an old joke.
8842240	8843240	Okay.
8843240	8846240	It's called the exclamation point.
8846240	8848240	What?
8848240	8850240	Fucked you exclamation points? You don't remember that?
8850240	8852240	The exclamation points?
8852240	8854240	Yeah.
8854240	8856240	You have to explain, no.
8856240	8859240	It's hard to explain.
8859240	8861240	Never mind.
8861240	8864240	Hold on, where's our Price is Right losing horn?
8869240	8871240	I think I just died a little bit.
8871240	8875240	You don't even want to try and explain what this is? Because obviously you thought it was funny.
8875240	8880240	I don't really want to explain because I've been up for 32 hours.
8880240	8883240	What have you been up for 32 hours for?
8883240	8885240	It was my party.
8885240	8893240	Well, it's your party and you'll make a fail call to Orange Lounge Radio if you want to. So congratulations, this fail horn is for you.
8893240	8896240	I want to kill myself.
8896240	8899240	Oh, I want to kill myself.
8899240	8901240	Don't kill yourself, just go to bed.
8901240	8906240	Oh, and Allison, the best thing, it's a 4chan meme.
8906240	8911240	Oh, God. Did I really just let that onto this program? Oh well, I suppose it was an endable at some point.
8911240	8912240	Yes you did.
8912240	8914240	Oh well, whatever.
8914240	8922240	Where there is a dark corner of the internet to be hiding in, there lies 4chan. What do you know?
8922240	8925240	And I hide there because I fail.
8925240	8927240	Alright, well congratulations on failing.
8927240	8929240	Alright, have a good night, Death Wishing, and happy birthday.
8929240	8931240	The worst call ever, thank you.
8931240	8933240	They want your cupcakes, by the way.
8933240	8935240	Oh, yeah, I have 15 of them.
8935240	8936240	Awesome, later.
8936240	8943240	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. Try not to have a fail call.
8943240	8945240	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8945240	8947240	The best!
8947240	8949240	No, okay, I'm done with that.
8949240	8951240	Did that really come from 4chan?
8951240	8955240	I, okay, that whole thing, this is completely unrelated to why I'm calling.
8955240	8956240	Okay.
8956240	8958240	This is Breslau, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.
8958240	8959240	Oh, hi Breslau, sorry.
8959240	8962240	I would assume no listeners know that from the screechy voice we heard in...
8962240	8964240	Guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy.
8964240	8965240	Just kidding.
8965240	8967240	I hate everybody.
8967240	8971240	I was red in the face when you were playing that, so now everybody thinks of me as this moron.
8971240	8976240	Well, good, now you know how I feel when I saw the Like A Prayer thing on YouTube.
8976240	8978240	Okay, there we go.
8978240	8984240	No, that came, okay, my roommate just kept saying the best of the best, like, to try to troll me.
8984240	8986240	I'm like, okay, seriously, what the hell is that from?
8986240	8991240	So, she shows me the video, and I think it's hilarious, and I spam it all over the internet.
8991240	8994240	So, and I got Travis good with it.
8994240	8995240	I see.
8995240	8999240	Any time I can troll my own co-host is a good day for me.
8999240	9000240	Very good day for you.
9000240	9011240	Now, I was actually calling, because we started a tradition two years ago on this very station.
9011240	9015240	We called it March Madness, but now since we started in January, we just call it Madness.
9015240	9021240	The best game of all time tournament, best 80 games of all time, square off in battle, and only one survives.
9021240	9028240	Last year it was Super Mario Brothers 3, and I'm officially opening the vote for nominations.
9028240	9032240	Ah, so nominations are kicking off tonight, even though it's not 2010 yet.
9032240	9036240	Are you kicking off things a little early, DMN?
9036240	9042240	Uh, yes, because I have so much, I'm going to have so much stress in January.
9042240	9044240	I want to get it started now.
9044240	9047240	Well, it's your schtick, you can do whatever the hell you want, DMN. You go.
9047240	9048240	Yes.
9048240	9049240	All right.
9049240	9055240	We're changing the voting around, so there could be, like, games like Rock Band and DDR,
9055240	9059240	now, I know a lot of people who listen to the show are huge Be Monty fans, and that's nothing against them,
9059240	9067240	but it's been a problem when DDR is seeded in the top 12, and Rock Band has seeded in the top five for consecutive years.
9067240	9074240	So we're changing the formula a little bit to keep it a little bit more fair,
9074240	9077240	so we don't see games like Rock Band get all the way to the final four,
9077240	9080240	because a lot of people are like, this game doesn't really need to be here.
9080240	9084240	What are you doing different?
9084240	9086240	Or is it a top secret formula?
9086240	9087240	It's a secret.
9087240	9092240	I see. It's like the herbs and spices at KFC. It's going to forever remain top secret. All right.
9092240	9093240	It's a secret to everybody.
9093240	9099240	So go vote on something that you're not really sure how it works, but in the end, there will be a winner that will be picked.
9099240	9100240	And pie?
9100240	9105240	I have all the details of submitting your vote on orangeolensradio.com right now.
9105240	9106240	Sweet.
9106240	9111240	If there are any questions, they can also be directed to uslmadness at gmail.com.
9111240	9115240	I'll be putting bracket details up probably in a couple of weeks.
9115240	9120240	But votes are open now, so vote early, but don't vote often, because you can only vote once.
9120240	9122240	I have a question.
9122240	9123240	Yes?
9123240	9128240	My question is, why don't we just call this whole thing over and Super Metroid wins, because that is what should happen.
9128240	9130240	You know, I agree with you.
9130240	9132240	Super Metroid is the greatest game of all time.
9132240	9138240	I will tell you that both years, and I will even tell you this year, it will be my top vote.
9138240	9141240	But when it gets beaten by crap like Tetris.
9141240	9146240	Aw, well Tetris isn't crap, but it's just not Super Metroid.
9146240	9147240	It's not Super Metroid.
9147240	9150240	But I also had another reason I was calling in.
9150240	9151240	Oh, my.
9151240	9152240	Not to promote anything.
9152240	9161240	I actually, I have a beef with video game marketing, and since I finally called into the show and tuned in for the first time in like five months,
9161240	9164240	my game of the year this year was Borderlands.
9164240	9166240	Hands down.
9166240	9173240	But this game didn't get a lot of press, because everyone's, you know, staining their pants about Modern Warfare 2.
9173240	9177240	I'm going to be honest with you, Modern Warfare 2 is not the best game I've played.
9177240	9179240	It is not the best game I've played this year.
9179240	9182240	It is not the best game I've played in the past five years.
9182240	9184240	Modern Warfare 2 is above average.
9184240	9186240	It's a good game.
9186240	9188240	But it's not this amazing thing people make it out to be.
9188240	9193240	The reason why it was this great thing everyone made it out to be is marketing.
9193240	9199240	I wish some of these games that were great got more marketing.
9199240	9208240	If Borderlands got the marketing it deserved, I think it would have, it would have sold more, it would have got, people would have liked it more,
9208240	9214240	and the game from what I noticed really got popular by a little bit of, a little bit of marketing and a little bit of word of mouth.
9214240	9220240	But you see games like Katamari Damacy, Psychonauts, gosh, what was the other one I had?
9220240	9222240	Okami would be a good example.
9222240	9225240	These games get fantastic reviews.
9225240	9230240	And unfortunately in these days that doesn't mean anything and it's depressing.
9230240	9232240	You know what's weird though? Sometimes it does.
9232240	9238240	Like I look at a game like Braid that really did everything based off of that word of mouth.
9238240	9243240	But maybe that's the difference between download title and going to the store and drop $60 because you know.
9243240	9248240	And one question I usually ask people when they tell me a game's good I say, well is it $60 good?
9248240	9251240	Or is it, you know, a rental good?
9251240	9256240	That stems from an old game on my show that Jimmy and I did on our old show way back.
9256240	9258240	God I don't even want to remember.
9258240	9262240	But we had a segment called Actual Retail Price where we would name games that were coming out
9262240	9265240	and we would say what we would actually pay for them.
9265240	9268240	And in some cases I'd pay more than $60 for a game.
9268240	9271240	And in a lot of cases I'd maybe pay $40 for a game.
9271240	9275240	Look at a game like World of Warcraft, I have paid more than $60 for that game.
9275240	9280240	In fact I've paid more than I care to admit.
9280240	9283240	But Modern Warfare 2 is not a $60 game.
9283240	9285240	It was a $45 game.
9285240	9287240	I hate to say it.
9287240	9296240	But I needed to get that out because I'm sick, and Nintendo is so guilty of this.
9296240	9298240	All I have to say is Wii Music.
9298240	9301240	They marketed this as the greatest thing since sliced bread and it was crap.
9301240	9304240	But that's all.
9304240	9307240	I'm done. It was good talking to you guys. Happy holidays.
9307240	9310240	No, I appreciate it. It's a damn good point DMN.
9310240	9313240	And I think something will also continue next week.
9313240	9316240	Next week is going to be our last show of the year and the holidays will die down a little bit.
9316240	9319240	And we're going to get into some of these talks about not just the stuff of the year.
9319240	9322240	In fact I kind of envision we haven't really sat down to talk about next week's show.
9322240	9328240	But I sort of see that we're going to spend half of it talking about the year and half of it talking about the decade.
9328240	9333240	And I think in this decade alone we've come to have to pay a lot more for our games.
9333240	9340240	We're paying now $60 for games whereas at the beginning of the decade with the whole CD based thing we weren't paying so much before.
9340240	9345240	I will say the first game I paid $60 for, Street Fighter II on the Super Nintendo.
9345240	9349240	First game I paid $60 for was Killer Instinct on the Super Nintendo.
9349240	9352240	I do realize that cartridge based games did raise that expectation earlier.
9352240	9356240	But CD was supposed to drop that and now it's come back up again. It's very interesting.
9356240	9361240	We will talk about a little more of this next week as we start to kind of wrap up the year and the decade.
9361240	9363240	Because it will be a slow news week. You know that.
9363240	9365240	So more to come on that next week.
9365240	9368240	But thank you so much GMN. We appreciate the call as always.
9368240	9370240	And keep up the good work with Understadation Live.
9370240	9373240	I wouldn't call it good work but we'll keep up the work.
9373240	9374240	Keep up the fair work.
9374240	9375240	Happy New Year guys.
9375240	9378240	And hey if Travis does come out here you should come with him.
9378240	9381240	I am planning on it. We're working on synchronizing our trips.
9381240	9385240	We might have to just make it OLRCon. We'll rent a hall or something.
9385240	9389240	We'll rent them a Sonic Lodge and just throw ourselves a party.
9389240	9391240	Sounds good man.
9391240	9392240	Take care.
9392240	9393240	Alright take care. Bye bye.
9393240	9394240	Later.
9394240	9396240	That's going to do it for calls tonight. Sorry to those who didn't get through.
9396240	9398240	But remember you can't always send us an email.
9398240	9401240	Or you can always give us an offline call.
9401240	9405240	Or you can always send us an email bag. Twitter. Whatever you want to do there.
9405240	9408240	So sorry to those again who did not get through.
9408240	9410240	Anyhow.
9410240	9412240	It's about time for us to wrap up the show.
9412240	9415240	But I know Loki might have had some more last minute stories he wants to get to.
9415240	9418240	But he's too busy laughing over there at the freaking...
9418240	9420240	Well I was laughing at some stuff.
9420240	9427240	But I like how they have I'm on a Boat as one of the songs in there and they have the video for it.
9427240	9429240	Nice.
9429240	9433240	So other things we'll mention real quick.
9433240	9443240	There's a game that was originally on the iPhone and the iPod Touch from a French independent developer called Press Start Studios.
9443240	9448240	And it's a hack and slash game called Twin Blades The Reaping Vanguard.
9448240	9450240	And it's a really awesome looking game.
9450240	9454240	And it's now coming to Xbox Live Indie Games.
9454240	9459240	And I think you should pick it up just because it's incredibly beautiful.
9459240	9461240	It's all hand drawn.
9461240	9464240	The game's coming out for three bucks.
9464240	9467240	So definitely worth picking up.
9467240	9469240	And it looks like a pretty fun little game.
9469240	9471240	Maybe I'll have to look for the iPhone one.
9471240	9474240	Yeah the iPhone one is actually already out now.
9474240	9478240	And is actually out for 99 cents.
9478240	9483240	This one will be coming out apparently on Christmas.
9483240	9485240	So the 25th.
9485240	9487240	Sounds kind of neat.
9487240	9494240	Assassin's Creed 2 is getting some download content that's going to kind of bridge the gap between the first and second games.
9494240	9499240	And they've added some new abilities including the spring jump.
9499240	9507240	And that's apparently two different contents between I guess the end of January and the end of February.
9507240	9511240	They're going to have the Battle of Forli.
9511240	9514240	And that's going to be for $3.99.
9514240	9522240	And also I guess the Bonfire of the Vanities which will run you $4.99.
9522240	9532240	And I guess it's speculated that the two editions will fill in the missing sequence 12 and 13 from the game.
9532240	9534240	So that's neat.
9534240	9540240	And lastly the 3D Blu-ray specs have been finalized.
9540240	9546240	And this is going to be kind of going forward I guess.
9546240	9549240	I don't know if they're going to start this next year or what.
9549240	9554240	But obviously the big trend in entertainment nowadays is 3D.
9554240	9558240	And they're going to be kind of bringing that to you with Blu-ray.
9558240	9570240	And one of the things that they did include with the Blu-ray specs is going to be that the 3D will be supported on PlayStation 3.
9570240	9575240	So soon you'll be able to watch 3D movies on your PlayStation 3.
9575240	9584240	Makes sense since they have similar technology right now available for the Avatar game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
9584240	9588240	Assuming you had the TV to support it and had the glasses to go with it.
9588240	9594240	But actually some of those TVs because the Avatar game supported all sorts of different methods for it.
9594240	9596240	One of which is Realty.
9596240	9599240	And I didn't even realize that Realty is available for TVs.
9599240	9605240	And those glasses are dirt cheap. I mean hell you go see a 3D movie in the theater.
9605240	9608240	You get a free pair of those polarized glasses.
9608240	9610240	Aren't you supposed to turn them into the bucket at the end so they can be steam washed?
9610240	9614240	Fuck that. I'm paying extra money for the movie.
9614240	9616240	I'm keeping those damn glasses.
9616240	9621240	But yes, for Avatar I did recycle them. I did have some before just in case.
9621240	9622240	Yeah I stole one when I saw it.
9622240	9624240	A kid did have a pair from Disneyland that I accidentally held onto.
9624240	9628240	If I ever get a TV though that does support Realty, I'm keeping those damn glasses.
9628240	9632240	Speaking of 3D and Disneyland, we gotta plan a trip in February y'all.
9632240	9634240	Guess who's coming back?
9634240	9636240	Oh my gosh, did you see Princess Tiana?
9636240	9639240	I did. I was so excited to give her a hug.
9639240	9642240	She let me pretend to be the prince even though the prince was standing right there.
9642240	9643240	That's awesome.
9643240	9646240	But my female friend that was with me, she posed with the prince so it worked out.
9646240	9648240	You should have posed with the prince too.
9648240	9651240	I should have but there were all these little kids around.
9651240	9656240	I don't think the parents would appreciate those types of questions so we'll just leave it at that.
9656240	9664240	But no, I obviously had a good time and I'm excited to go back next year because we've got to see Captain EO.
9664240	9666240	It's gotta happen.
9666240	9669240	Oh you guys, Captain EO is officially coming back in February.
9669240	9670240	Okay we're going.
9670240	9673240	Officially has been announced. Honey, I Shrunk the Audiences is out.
9673240	9679240	And what's interesting, I actually asked one of the guys working there if there was any banners for the Captain EO announcement up.
9679240	9681240	And he said no, it's just that they made it official.
9681240	9687240	And I was like, well you know, as nice as Honey, I Shrunk the Audiences has been, it's kind of aged so you guys probably aren't surprised.
9687240	9690240	And they were like, yeah we kind of knew it was leaving in a year anyway.
9690240	9694240	And I was like, oh really? Something about that kind of caught my ear?
9694240	9697240	Okay and this Captain EO thing has been announced for a limited run.
9697240	9700240	What has already been planned for next?
9700240	9704240	Because this means something has already been planned for 2011 for that theater.
9704240	9706240	So Captain EO is going to be there but only for about a year.
9706240	9708240	Then something else is coming.
9708240	9710240	I have a theory. I have a theory.
9710240	9711240	What is your theory?
9711240	9712240	It's Tomorrowland, right?
9712240	9713240	Yes.
9713240	9715240	Pixar is a big thing right now.
9715240	9719240	I'm going to guess it's a Wall-E movie would take that theater.
9719240	9721240	And I think a Wall-E movie would be pretty rad.
9721240	9722240	That would be awesome.
9722240	9725240	That's my bet, is a Wall-E movie replaces Captain EO.
9725240	9730240	If it was my way it'd be Tron and they'd reopen the monorail and actually make it a good Tron ride.
9730240	9733240	The People Mover, OMG, yes please.
9733240	9736240	So much this. So much this.
9736240	9741240	If it wasn't for that stupid guy who decided to dive off the wrong side of it,
9741240	9746240	we would still have us a People Mover and we would still have us the Tron thing which was the only good part about the People Mover.
9746240	9750240	I will say that. I don't want to make this the Disney show but we're at the end of the show anyway.
9750240	9751240	There's not a lot left.
9751240	9752240	I will say this real quick.
9752240	9757240	One thing I did see at Disneyland that just opened up Friday, reopened up I should say,
9757240	9759240	all new, all completely redone.
9759240	9760240	I was very impressed.
9760240	9762240	Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln is back.
9762240	9763240	You know, I have never seen that.
9763240	9765240	It's actually pretty awesome.
9765240	9766240	I gotta say.
9766240	9769240	It'll get your patriotic senses tingling.
9769240	9771240	Like, you know, it's very well done.
9771240	9775240	The animatronics are the part of it that's amazing because Abraham Lincoln looks fucking real.
9775240	9778240	And he stands up and sits down and all this stuff.
9778240	9781240	It's like, oh my gosh, why isn't this level of animatronics?
9781240	9782240	Let's pick a date and go.
9782240	9783240	We're gonna have to do it.
9783240	9786240	Let's hope that's not Evil Lincoln who will murder us all.
9786240	9787240	No, it's not Evil Lincoln.
9787240	9794240	I especially love the part when President Lincoln stands up and does his rendition of Lady Gaga's poker face.
9794240	9798240	Starts mimicking the bad romance video, yes.
9798240	9799240	It really hit me.
9799240	9801240	In the voice of Christopher Walken.
9801240	9803240	Nice.
9803240	9806240	All right, anyhow, there you go.
9806240	9808240	That's my little snap Disney review.
9808240	9812240	But they have water back at California Adventure.
9812240	9816240	The main walkway at California Adventure is closed.
9816240	9817240	You have to go all the way around to get anywhere.
9817240	9820240	But California Adventure, I have a cry.
9820240	9825240	But they really are getting that park ready for 2011.
9825240	9826240	It's gonna be awesome.
9826240	9827240	It's gonna be awesome.
9827240	9829240	Aladdin is also closing.
9829240	9831240	It's announced at the Aladdin show at California Adventure.
9831240	9832240	It's gonna close in August.
9832240	9834240	It's probably going to Broadway.
9834240	9835240	Don't cry too much.
9835240	9837240	It's in London's West End right now.
9837240	9839240	Pam Anderson is playing the Genie.
9839240	9841240	Which, what, but okay.
9841240	9844240	But a Toy Story musical is gonna replace it.
9844240	9845240	That's cool.
9845240	9846240	Yeah, so we'll see.
9846240	9851240	Well, you know, Toy Story 3 is in the works.
9851240	9853240	So.
9853240	9857240	Oh, I'll say about Toy Story 3, they're actually gonna be doing an IMAX releases for that.
9857240	9858240	Oh yeah, the 3D.
9858240	9860240	Yeah, they did the 3D preview before.
9860240	9861240	So, good times.
9861240	9863240	And, you know, again, how does this relate to video games?
9863240	9865240	Movie, video game tie-ins, and the technology.
9865240	9867240	Just like Logie's saying about Avatar.
9867240	9871240	You know, this type of technology you're seeing in Avatar is already in the game.
9871240	9874240	It's just that it's probably too expensive for a lot of you guys to afford.
9874240	9877240	3D, we had Toy Story Midway Mania come out this year on the Wii.
9877240	9882240	And although the game was not as good as the ride, the 3D is an option in it.
9882240	9886240	You know, this is the wave of the future as this decade comes to a close.
9886240	9888240	It's gonna be very interesting.
9888240	9893240	Speaking of the decade coming to a close, you know next week is gonna be all about not just the year but the decade.
9893240	9895240	Probably do a little bit of both.
9895240	9897240	I'm not sure if we'll have any special guests yet.
9897240	9898240	I'm gonna try to line up some folks.
9898240	9900240	We'll see what happens over the next week.
9900240	9906240	But we will be back live again on All Games Radio on the 27th with our last episode of the decade.
9906240	9911240	If you can believe it, we've been doing this show most of the decade.
9911240	9913240	That's kind of strange.
9913240	9916240	Well, we've hit seven years.
9916240	9920240	I know. Next year will be the eighth year of broadcasting.
9920240	9923240	2002 to 2010 and beyond.
9923240	9925240	We're bored.
9925240	9931240	Anyhow, before we close up shop tonight, of course we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts here in studio.
9931240	9933240	So, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
9933240	9935240	I want cupcakes.
9935240	9937240	You guys and cupcakes.
9937240	9941240	My final thought is at the grocery store there's a box that says Betty Crocker on it.
9941240	9943240	It'll help you out.
9943240	9945240	Loki, your final thought, please.
9945240	9949240	I don't know.
9949240	9951240	Tiare, your final thought, please.
9951240	9953240	Thank you so much for being here tonight.
9953240	9955240	I'm going to borrow that top.
9955240	9957240	Betch. Wait, wait. You've got to see the back side.
9957240	9959240	I'm wearing my Kelly shirt tonight. Don't be a betch.
9959240	9961240	That's great.
9961240	9963240	And, Loki, your final thought tonight?
9963240	9965240	He just said he didn't know.
9965240	9967240	I thought he had a real one.
9967240	9969240	He started to say something.
9969240	9971240	I don't really have anything.
9971240	9973240	Okay, well then fine.
9973240	9975240	That's it. We're going to close up shop.
9975240	9979240	See you next week. We're going to do it all again on our 350th decade-end episode.
9979240	9981240	Rob better bring cupcakes.
